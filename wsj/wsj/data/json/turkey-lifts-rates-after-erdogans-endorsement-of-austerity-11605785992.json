    "body": "ISTANBUL—Turkey’s central bank sharply raised its benchmark interest rate, pledging to combat inflation less than two weeks after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reshuffled his economic team and backed a shift in approach to repair an economy beset by a dwindling currency.<br />Led by newly appointed governor Naci Agbal, the central bank Thursday raised its key, one-week repo rate to 15% from 10.25%, saying it would provide all funding through that facility.<br />Earlier this month, Mr. Erdogan dismissed Mr. Agbal’s predecessor, accepted the resignation of his finance minister and son-in-law, Berat Albayrak, and signaled that he would accept what he had long rejected: austerity.<br />“We will not abstain from making sacrifices and implementing the correct recipes, even if they are bitter,” the president said last week.<br />Mr. Erdogan’s about-face and the ensuing rate increase has pushed the lira sharply higher. The Turkish currency, which had lost nearly a third of its value against the U.S. dollar this year, has risen about 12% since the reshuffle."
