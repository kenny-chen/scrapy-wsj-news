    "body": "The dollar hit its lowest levels against a basket of currencies in more than two years this week—and investors think it’ll fall further.<br />The consensus view of a falling dollar is based on a big assumption: Covid-19 will be more or less conquered in the months ahead. Vaccines will allow economies around the world to return to normal within the next year, encouraging investors to step back from the relative safety of U.S. assets and invest in stocks, bonds and currencies outside the U.S.<br />The dollar hit its lowest levels against a basket of currencies in more than two years this week. Investors and analysts think it has further to fall. The only questions seem to be how much and how fast.<br />The slide in the dollar coincides with exuberance in the U.S. stock market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average pierced 30000 for the first time on Tuesday before retreating Wednesday. A weak dollar can help stocks with big overseas operations since it makes earnings in foreign currencies worth more in dollar terms.<br />The  ICE  U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies from major trading partners such as Japan and the eurozone, slid below 92 this week, its lowest level since 2018, according to FactSet. It is down more than 10.5% since its March peak."
