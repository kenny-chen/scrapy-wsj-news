    "body": "How often do you recommend we should review or consider revising our estate plans/wills?<br />A good rule of thumb is to review your plans and documents every three to five years, says James Miller, president of Woodward Financial Advisors in Chapel Hill, N.C. Of course, various events and/or milestones in people’s lives also could trigger revisions.<br />Among them, says Mr. Miller: birth of a child or grandchild; minor children turning age 18 or going to college; children getting married; new charitable intents (or changes in such intents); death of a spouse; and signs of dementia or other cognitive issues.<br />Two additional reasons for revisiting your estate plans: significant financial changes in your life—say, you sell a business or inherit a substantial amount of money—or changes in estate-tax law. For instance, the new Secure Act modifies a number of rules that govern retirement accounts.<br />With all this in mind, “it’s important to make estate plans flexible,” Mr. Miller says. In this way, a person can “avoid frequent trips back to the estate attorney for changes, which can be costly and time consuming.”"
