    "body": "When it comes to saving for emergencies, the evidence is clear: People want to do it. They just don’t follow through.<br />A survey by the AARP Public Policy Institute, for instance, found that 71% of workers would likely contribute to an emergency-savings fund if their employer offered one, and 87% would do so if their employer made matching contributions.<br />And yet, according to a 2019 study by the Federal Reserve, roughly four in 10 Americans wouldn’t be able to come up with $400 in a financial emergency. If they do have an unexpected expense, they have to rely on costly measures, such as taking out a payday loan or borrowing on a credit card.<br />What are the psychological barriers that explain this huge gap between intentions and actual saving behavior? And how can companies and governments use our knowledge of these barriers to help Americans better save for emergencies?<br />To answer these questions, we first need to understand mental accounting—the psychological processes that people use to evaluate their spending and saving decisions. Only then can we design nudges that make it easy for workers to budget for those unexpected, yet inevitable, financial emergencies."
