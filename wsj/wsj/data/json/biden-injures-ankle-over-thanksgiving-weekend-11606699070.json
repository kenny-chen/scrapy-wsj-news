    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden twisted his ankle over the weekend while playing with his dog Major, his aides said Sunday. The injury caused a hairline fracture, requiring the 78-year-old to wear a walking boot “for several weeks,” according to his physician.<br />“Initial x-rays did not show any obvious fracture, but his clinical exam warranted more detailed imaging,” Mr. Biden’s doctor, Kevin O’Connor, director of Executive Medicine at GW Medical Faculty Associates, said in a statement Sunday.<br />“Follow-up CT scan confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden’s lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the mid-foot,“ Dr. O’Connor added. ”It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks.”<br />Mr. Biden returned to Wilmington, Del., on Sunday after spending the holiday weekend in Rehoboth Beach.<br />Despite the injury, aides said Mr. Biden would continue working on his transition to set up his administration. He is scheduled to receive his first official security briefing Monday and expected to announce his economic team on Tuesday."
