Zurich didn’t disclose a potential deal amount. “The terms of any transaction are subject to negotiations and there can be no assurance that a transaction will take place,” it said.<br />The deal would be conducted through Zurich’s Farmers Group Inc. unit, which would expand Zurich Insurance’s U.S. business.<br />In notes following the Reuters report, some Wall Street analysts said a price of $4 billion would represent a good deal for MetLife shareholders. MetLife hasn’t commented on the potential transaction since news broke in September and didn’t issue a statement itself Friday."
