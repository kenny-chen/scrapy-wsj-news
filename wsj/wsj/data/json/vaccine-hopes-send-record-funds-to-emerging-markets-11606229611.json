    "body": "The amount of money flowing into emerging-market funds last week hit an all-time high, as advances in vaccine development and a weaker dollar boosted investors’ risk appetite.<br />Investors channeled $10.8 billion into funds that invest in emerging-market stocks and bonds, according to research from  Bank of America  and EPFR data, a sum the bank said was the highest ever. The largest net purchases by foreign investors included Indian and South Korean equities, as well as Mexican government debt, according to data from Capital Economics.<br />The activity marked a turnaround for many developing economies, which have been largely shunned this year due to the spread of the coronavirus and the subsequent hit to global growth. Fund managers pulled more than $70 billion out of emerging markets in March, April and May, according to Morningstar.<br />But positive developments for vaccines in recent weeks have investors preparing for life after Covid-19, and some are making bets on how to reap the biggest rewards.<br />“Investors are becoming more risk loving,” said Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Group. “If the world is going to slowly get better, the case for emerging markets in particular becomes quite compelling.”"
