      <td>Growing body of research looking at U.S. and Chinese real-estate markets suggests long booms may drag on productivity of the economy</td>
      <td>This October, U.S. housing sales hit their highest level since 2006. China’s residential real-estate investment was up 14% relative to the same month last year. Around the world, many housing markets have shrugged off a colossal economic slump, helped by low interest rates.<br />In the short term, such investment is a boost to economic activity in a year where headline figures have collapsed. But there are significant downsides. The fact that housing booms can be a longer-term risk to financial stability is well known, but a growing body of research suggests that even where there is no market blowup, surges in prices and investment can have a deleterious impact on productivity.<br />New evidence comes from the Bank for International Settlements, with a paper by economistSebastian Doerr showing that among U.S. listed companies, those with a higher share of real-estate assets are persistently less productive than their industry peers.<br />That alone wouldn’t be a problem as such. Some companies are always more productive than others. But rising real-estate prices make it easier for companies that own real estate to access funding because of their growing collateral, so multiyear booms in property prices compound the problem.<br />Looking at data covering the U.S. from 1993 to 2008, capital was reallocated toward productivity laggards over time, worsening the overall picture for the economy. For every 10% increase in real-estate prices, an industry would record a 0.6% relative decline in total-factor productivity due to the effect of skewed capital allocation.</td>

      <td>As business increasingly moves online, Vimeo should have investors tuning in, even once they are physically back at work</td>
      <td>Positive coronavirus vaccine data has created a whiplash effect for investors who until recently were hiding in pandemic beneficiaries. But with the timeline for recovery still uncertain, the best offense may still be a good defense.<br />One place to look is in and around e-commerce—a sector that is likely to continue its red-hot run during the holiday shopping season and beyond.  Shopify ,  for example, is up over 150% this year. And while its shares fell more than 13% the day  Pfizer  reported efficacy results, they have since recovered nearly all of those losses as investors digest both the long winter ahead of the Covid-19 vaccine as well as the fact that online shopping is likely to continue to grow in earnest, pandemic or not.<br />But while Shopify is certainly well loved at this point—its market capitalization now tops $126 billion—lesser-known opportunities are popping up for those investors paying close attention. One such play is  IAC/InterActiveCorp . ’s Vimeo, a video hosting and sharing platform used by a growing number of Shopify’s customers, among many others, to easily and effectively help tell their story and increase conversion online.<br />IAC said Vimeo raised $150 million in early November in an oversubscribed equity offering from outside investors that valued its software-as-a-service company at $2.75 billion. That implies big potential for a company that is currently operating at a $300 million annual revenue run rate implied by its third-quarter results.<br />For investors looking to turn movies into money, opportunity may soon knock. IAC said earlier this month it is considering a full spinoff of Vimeo, which would make it the 11th public company to come from IAC’s golden breeding grounds. Fostered by the very hands that helped turn public companies such as Expedia Group and Match Group into behemoths in their own right, Vimeo’s business was already accelerating before the pandemic. Its organic bookings growth consistently accelerated last year from 11% in the first quarter to 27% by the fourth quarter of 2019 according to IAC.</td>

      <td>Joe Rogan’s podcast, about to go exclusive, will need to deliver a big boost in paid users to justify the stock’s run</td>
      <td>Joe Rogan has raised some eyebrows at  Spotify .  The question remains if he can bend many new ears—especially those willing to pay for the experience.<br />The mega-popular podcaster moved his show to the streaming platform on Sept. 1, per a deal valued at more than $100 million struck earlier in the year. Spotify has been hot on podcasts of late. It has also struck recent deals with Kim Kardashian and the DC Comics brand, and has made several acquisitions to beef up its podcast platform. This includes a $235 million outlay earlier this month for Megaphone, which provides production and advertising services to podcasters.<br />But the deal with Mr. Rogan is the most closely watched, as it brings an established star with a huge and dedicated following. It also brings a fair dose of heat, given Mr. Rogan’s penchant for booking highly controversial guests such as talk-radio host Alex Jones. A recent appearance by the latter sparked some consternation even among Spotify employees, who debated internally whether that show and others met the company’s content guidelines. Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek addressed the matter on the company’s third-quarter call last month, affirming the need to apply content policies evenly. “If we can’t do that, then there are other choices for a lot of creators to go to,” he said.<br />The company will learn soon whether Mr. Rogan’s show is truly worth the trouble. The program becomes exclusive to Spotify in December, which means the company’s fourth-quarter results will be the first to reflect any change in usage or revenue from the show’s fans who won’t be able to get it elsewhere. But the types of users will matter as well. Spotify’s most recent results showed a bigger jump in users for its free, advertising-driven service compared to subscribers for the premium tier. The company added 15 million users for the free tier, compared with six million premium subscribers in the third quarter. The company’s forecast implies similar outsize growth for the ad-driven tier in the fourth quarter.<br />Simply adding ears for advertising won’t be enough for Spotify to justify the investments it has made in podcasts—and the market-value boost the company has so far gotten for its effort. Despite some slippage since the third-quarter report on Oct. 29, Spotify’s shares are still up 67% since the deal with Mr. Rogan was announced in May.</td>

Drivers could enjoy the benefits sooner than manufacturers.<br />So-called connected cars aren’t new: The majority of vehicles sold in the U.S. today and almost half globally are already fitted with a modem. But vehicle electronics are only now being reconfigured to take full advantage of fast mobile broadband, notably to deliver smartphone-style updates “over the air.” This is a game-changer.<br />Take the  Ford  F-150, the bestselling vehicle in the U.S. since 1981. The new generation now arriving in showrooms debuts a new Ford-built software tech stack that will bring the kind of capabilities consumers are used to in smartphones. A “central brain” will deploy updates around the vehicle to fix bugs or add features, says Stuart Taylor, Ford’s head of connectivity. After launching on the F-150, the system will go into Ford’s other key new products, the Mustang Mach-E and revived 2021 Bronco.<br />More new vehicles will, like the Ford-150, have a crucial difference from their predecessors: They will improve even after leaving the dealership. For drivers, this promises to bring down the curtain on clunky infotainment systems that feel out of date even when new.</td>

      <td>Rising stock indexes suggest investors are breathing a sigh of relief right now. Wall Street’s fear gauge says otherwise, though.<br />Stocks have soared back to records, fueled by optimism about a coming vaccine for the novel coronavirus as well as relief that the election—widely anticipated for months—has passed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has rallied 12.7% in November, on track for its strongest month since 1987. The S&P 500 has advanced 11% this month and hit a high on Tuesday.<br />Although market volatility has edged lower in recent days, the Cboe Volatility Index has hovered above 20 since Feb. 24, marking 194 consecutive trading sessions above that threshold. That is the longest such streak since one ending in 2009 during the financial crisis, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The gauge is based on options prices tied to the S&P 500 and tends to fall as stocks are rising.<br />The VIX at an elevated level signals investors remain cautious despite a stock market that is flying high, with concerns lingering that the volatility that gripped markets earlier in the year could return. It also reflects elevated prices for options bets tied to the S&P 500, which investors often tap to hedge portfolios or make directional bets on stocks.<br />The stretch is remarkable because it includes a period in which U.S. stocks tumbled into a bear market—defined as a drop of at least 20%—before rebounding back toward new highs. Despite the recent ascent for stocks, the elevated VIX signals some anxiety about the market’s path. Since Feb. 24, the S&P 500 has gained about 12.5%.</td>

BBVA said on Nov. 16 that it was conducting due diligence on Sabadell after agreeing to sell its operations in the U.S. to Pittsburgh-based  PNC Financial Services Group Inc.  for $11.6 billion.<br />European banks have faced intensifying pressure to merge as they struggle to make money in a negative-rates environment and as the pandemic pummels the economy.

The watchdog, known as Apas, launched an investigation into the work of the auditing firm’s local affiliate, EY GmbH, after Wirecard admitted that more than $2 billion of cash it had said was held in bank accounts on its behalf didn’t exist.<br />“We are still evaluating Apas’s report and haven’t yet made any decision about whether to bring any criminal charges,” a spokesperson for the prosecutor said. Under German law, any criminal cases would be against individuals rather than firms, she said.<br />The prosecutors’ review of Apas’s submission, which began some weeks ago, was earlier reported in the German newspaper Handelsblatt. Apas declined to comment, citing strict legal confidentiality around its investigations.<br />EY said it hadn’t been given a copy of the Apas report and so couldn’t speculate on its contents. “To date, we have no indications of any criminal conduct by the auditors at EY Germany,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to support all official investigations.”</td>

      <td>Centrica  PLC, a major U.K.-based energy supplier, is trying to sell its portfolio of liquefied natural gas supply contracts and other assets, according to people familiar with the matter, as it seeks to simplify its operations amid volatile LNG prices.<br />The targeted value from such a deal couldn’t be learned. However, similar recent transactions suggest that Centrica, the owner of energy and electricity service provider British Gas, may actually need to pay any potential buyer to take the LNG business off its hands, underscoring the uncertain outlook for gas prices internationally.<br />The sale effort comes after Centrica in July agreed to sell its North American energy supply, services and trading business, Direct Energy, to  NRG Energy ,  Inc. for $3.6 billion.<br />The LNG business could offer potential buyers a quick, cheap way to enter the LNG market as an established player. Last year,  Total SA  struck a deal to acquire the noncore U.S. LNG business of  Toshiba Corp.  The Japan-based conglomerate paid the French energy major $800 million to take over its supply and transportation LNG contracts. At the time, Total said the acquisition fit its strategy to further expand its scale in the sector.<br />Any bet on Centrica’s LNG business would come amid forecasts that natural-gas prices are poised to extend their recent rebound in 2021, following a yearslong slump that reached its nadir in June. The slide in crude-oil prices during the pandemic prompted U.S. energy companies to throttle back output, pinching gas supplies because many wells produce gas as a byproduct.</td>

      <td>Commercial properties will be helped by a coronavirus vaccine, but long-term pressures may accelerate postpandemic</td>
      <td>This is the fifth and final column in a five-part Heard on the Street series on how the American economy might look once the Covid-19 pandemic is over.<br />The office and the shopping mall are two of the things most visibly changed by Covid-19. They also have the most potential to bounce back once a vaccine is distributed, but they could look quite different.<br />Early indicators suggest that many people want to continue going about their lives more remotely. About a quarter of office workers in a recent survey by  Jones Lang LaSalle  said they would like to work outside the office full-time post-pandemic. Meanwhile, Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said this month the retailer was convinced that most of the behavioral shift to online shopping “will persist beyond the pandemic.”<br />Still, it would be overly simplistic to assume landlords are necessarily imperiled. Commercial real estate is a business that can take time to evolve because of long-term leases. A typical retail term is about six years while offices are closer to 10 years, according to  CoStar Group .  In addition, rent collection has stabilized for offices, with owners collecting more than 96% of the usual rent as of July, according to industry body Nareit, which tracks figures for listed real-estate investment trusts. Even for free-standing retail—think big-box stores—rent collection was about 95% in September.<br />The outlier is shopping centers, where rent collection has rebounded since the 49% nadir in May but was still only at about 82% in September. The closure of more than 11,100 retail stores has been announced in the U.S. this year through November, according to CoStar. Some empty department stores could have second lives as e-commerce distribution centers, though that may be an option for only the very worst-off malls since it can affect the tax treatment of a property.</td>

      <td>Bank of Japan under Haruhiko Kuroda scores after boosting investments at stock-market bottom, but some say he shouldn’t play the market so much</td>
      <td>TOKYO—One of Japan’s biggest stock investors just reported record gains of more than $50 billion after a well-timed bet. But the person who engineered the windfall won’t be getting a Wall Street-style bonus this holiday season, and some have even started saying he shouldn’t play the market so much.<br />That’s because the hot-hitting portfolio manager is Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda, head of Japan’s central bank. Mr. Kuroda has led the  Bank of Japan ’s  push, unusual among global central banks, to invest in the Tokyo stock market as a way of rousing the nation’s animal spirits.<br />In March, he doubled the BOJ’s annual ceiling for its purchases of exchange-traded funds to the equivalent of $115 billion. That was the month the stock market began surging after a pandemic-induced dip. It closed Thursday at a 29-year high, up 60% from this year’s low.<br />The superb timing helped the central bank report a record jump for a six-month period in its stock portfolio’s gains when it released its semiannual financial report Thursday. It said the market value of its holdings stood at the equivalent of nearly $400 billion as of Sept. 30, which represented an unrealized profit of $56 billion over what it paid.<br />Six months earlier, the BOJ had barely any unrealized profit left, and at one point in March Mr. Kuroda said it was carrying large losses.</td>

That would make it the city’s largest listing this year after the IPO of Ant, backed by JD’s e-commerce rival Alibaba, was scuttled.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic has driven more people in China to seek medical help online. In the first six months of this year, average daily online consultations on JD Health’s platforms jumped to 86,100 from 14,835 a year earlier. While 2020 is certainly an anomaly, some of those users will likely stick around.<br />Virtual medical service, however, is still a nascent business for JD Health. The company makes almost all of its revenue from selling drugs and other health products online, either directly or from third-party vendors. The growth in online consultations will generate further demand for sales of prescription drugs for JD. But supportive government policies will likely be the real driver of growth for the online pharmacy business.<br />About two-thirds of drugs in China are sold through hospitals, but government policies could push more prescription drug sales through retail channels. Legislation revisions last year allowed online platforms to sell prescription drugs, while draft rules released this month laid out more specific regulations. The industry will no doubt be under stringent regulation and online platforms such as JD will spend a lot of resources on quality control. But with clearer rules, the industry will find it easier to navigate the regulatory landscape.</td>

The size and low cost of the issue is a win for activist investors who have been pushing for a new approach.<br />Along with French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel, Unibail’s former chief executive Léon Bressler successfully persuaded investors to vote against a controversial €3.5 billion equity raise two weeks ago. Back then, Unibail’s chairman and chief executive warned that unless shareholders stumped up, the company could lose access to bond markets. Both men have since been ousted, with Mr. Bressler taking over as chairman.<br />News that a Covid-19 vaccine will soon be available helped the activists’ case. The yield on Unibail’s outstanding bonds has increased slightly since investors voted against the capital raise, but remains much lower than during the March selloff.<br />The new debt will come on top of net borrowings already equivalent to 12 times the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Unibail generated last year. To get that number down, the activists want Unibail to sell underperforming Westfield malls in the U.S. But with the rise of e-commerce weighing on the value of stores, it may be hard to find buyers at an acceptable price.</td>

Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Square was in talks to acquire the tax-prep business.<br />Square said it would pay $50 million in cash for Credit Karma Tax, which entered the market in 2017 and helped more than two million individuals file their 2020 taxes. Around 41 million people used Intuit’s TurboTax to file their 2020 taxes.<br />The Justice Department argued that Credit Karma’s small but growing tax-prep business, which charges no fees, provided a check on Intuit’s ability to increase the prices it charges for paid versions of TurboTax and degrade the quality of free versions.<br />Allowing the two companies to move forward with the original deal would “further cement TurboTax’s dominance,” the department said in court papers.</td>

      <td>Salesforce.com Inc.  is in advanced talks to buy  Slack Technologies Inc.,  according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that would unite a giant in business software with a buzzy newcomer on a mission to replace office email.<br />The companies could reach a deal within days—possibly by the time Salesforce reports its third-quarter financial results Tuesday, some of the people said. Slack, with a market value of more than $17 billion as of Wednesday morning, would be Salesforce’s largest acquisition ever. There is no guarantee the companies will reach an agreement.<br />Salesforce is the world’s biggest seller of software that companies use to manage their customer relationships. Started 21 years ago and run by co-founder Marc Benioff, it was a pioneer in providing software via the cloud through a subscription rather than a costly upfront installation. Mr. Benioff, chairman and chief executive, is one of Silicon Valley’s highest profile executives, a status he burnished with the purchase of Time magazine.<br />Salesforce has a market value of some $230 billion after years of big gains and its rich stock price—which trades at nearly 100 times its trailing-year profits—gives the company a valuable currency to use for takeovers.<br />Mr. Benioff has gradually moved to expand the services Salesforce offers to customers to become more of an all-purpose software provider, helping companies with everything from analyzing their data using artificial-intelligence tools to managing staff. That has put Salesforce in more direct competition with other business-software vendors including  Microsoft Corp.</td>

      <td>The coronavirus pandemic has made propane a hot commodity among Americans heating outdoor spaces and hunkering down in Covid cabins. Fortunately for them, the country is flooded with the fuel, and prices have rarely been lower heading into winter.<br />Spot-market propane prices at the Mont Belvieu, Texas, trading hub have more than doubled since dropping in late March to their lowest level in more than a quarter-century. But at 55 cents a gallon, they are still about one-third lower than the 10-year average for November.<br />Residential prices, which are cheaper in the middle of the country and more expensive in East Coast markets such as Florida and New England, have lately averaged $1.85 a gallon, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. That is the lowest for this time of year in more than a decade.<br />It isn’t as though there is no demand for propane, which belongs with butane and ethane to a class of hydrocarbons called natural-gas liquids, or NGLs.<br />The U.S. is exporting about four times as much propane as it shipped abroad in 2013, when the country became the world’s top propane exporter. At home, an uptick in residential demand has helped to offset lower use by businesses and farmers, who haven’t needed grain-drying equipment much this year because a lack of rain allowed them to let crops dry in the field.</td>

The industry group said it would also impose unspecified sanctions on the company and start an investigation into its parent, an energy and chemicals conglomerate.<br />Yongcheng Coal missed a deadline earlier this month to repay 1 billion yuan, equivalent to $152 million, in 270-day commercial paper that matured Nov. 10, after having sold new debt just weeks earlier. The company had also transferred some assets, including stakes in a local bank and several chemical firms, to other local state companies.<br />The miner’s failure to make the debt payment and recent bond defaults by an automotive business and a chip maker have caused unease among investors, sending yields on riskier corporate bonds higher. Yields rise as bond prices fall.<br />Yields on three-year Chinese corporate bonds with double-A credit ratings—a grade that in China’s domestic rating system indicates a significant amount of risk—rose to more than 4.482% on Tuesday, their highest since December 2018, according to Wind. They edged down slightly to 4.479% Wednesday but are still significantly higher than a few weeks ago.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to be Treasury secretary, will confront an economic recovery that appears to be losing momentum and uncertain prospects for additional stimulus from Congress.<br />If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Yellen would play a key role pushing for more aid for an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic and related shutdowns, especially if Congress is unable to reach an agreement on a relief package before Mr. Biden takes office on Jan. 20.<br />The rebound that began over the summer is showing signs of faltering as new virus cases surge and job growth slows, and much of the aid lawmakers passed earlier this year has run out. JPMorgan Chase & Co. economists said last week they expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter of 2021.<br />Ms. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, will have to forge broad consensus on economic policy and sell ideas within the administration, on Capitol Hill and among the general public, said Tony Fratto, a Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration.<br />“Right now, we live in a country where people look at the same set of facts and come to diametrically opposite conclusions, so that is a big challenge for anybody who takes that job, to build support for your policy outcomes,” he said.</td>

      <td>U.S. crude-oil hits highest level since early March following sixth gain in seven sessions</td>
      <td>A recent rise in oil prices continued on Tuesday, sending crude to its highest level since early March with investors wagering on a brighter economic outlook and higher demand for fuel.<br />U.S. crude-oil futures for January delivery advanced 4.3% to $44.91 a barrel, rallying for the sixth time in seven sessions and eclipsing their peak closing level from late August. Oil started the year above $60, briefly tumbled below $0 for the first time ever in April as coronavirus shutdowns crippled demand, then rebounded around $40 this summer.<br />Prices had hovered around the $40 level for months, but upbeat coronavirus vaccine trial results in recent weeks are igniting fresh gains. The data from  Moderna Inc.  and the duos of  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  and  AstraZeneca  PLC and the University of Oxford are fueling hopes that global consumers will be vaccinated more quickly than previously expected and could resume traveling.<br />That would be a boon for energy producers like  Chevron Corp.  and  Exxon Mobil Corp.  because oil demand rises when more people are driving and flying and ships laden with goods are traveling all over the world. The pandemic fueled a historic drop in fuel demand early in the year and prompted a fresh selloff in late October, but traders now expect a recovery in consumption to extend the oil rebound into 2021.<br />“It’s a total change of vibe,” said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. “Everything is much more positive now.”</td>
