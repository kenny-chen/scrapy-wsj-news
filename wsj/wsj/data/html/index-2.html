      <td>Growing body of research looking at U.S. and Chinese real-estate markets suggests long booms may drag on productivity of the economy</td>
      <td>This October, U.S. housing sales hit their highest level since 2006. China’s residential real-estate investment was up 14% relative to the same month last year. Around the world, many housing markets have shrugged off a colossal economic slump, helped by low interest rates.<br />In the short term, such investment is a boost to economic activity in a year where headline figures have collapsed. But there are significant downsides. The fact that housing booms can be a longer-term risk to financial stability is well known, but a growing body of research suggests that even where there is no market blowup, surges in prices and investment can have a deleterious impact on productivity.<br />New evidence comes from the Bank for International Settlements, with a paper by economistSebastian Doerr showing that among U.S. listed companies, those with a higher share of real-estate assets are persistently less productive than their industry peers.<br />That alone wouldn’t be a problem as such. Some companies are always more productive than others. But rising real-estate prices make it easier for companies that own real estate to access funding because of their growing collateral, so multiyear booms in property prices compound the problem.<br />Looking at data covering the U.S. from 1993 to 2008, capital was reallocated toward productivity laggards over time, worsening the overall picture for the economy. For every 10% increase in real-estate prices, an industry would record a 0.6% relative decline in total-factor productivity due to the effect of skewed capital allocation.</td>

      <td>As business increasingly moves online, Vimeo should have investors tuning in, even once they are physically back at work</td>
      <td>Positive coronavirus vaccine data has created a whiplash effect for investors who until recently were hiding in pandemic beneficiaries. But with the timeline for recovery still uncertain, the best offense may still be a good defense.<br />One place to look is in and around e-commerce—a sector that is likely to continue its red-hot run during the holiday shopping season and beyond.  Shopify ,  for example, is up over 150% this year. And while its shares fell more than 13% the day  Pfizer  reported efficacy results, they have since recovered nearly all of those losses as investors digest both the long winter ahead of the Covid-19 vaccine as well as the fact that online shopping is likely to continue to grow in earnest, pandemic or not.<br />But while Shopify is certainly well loved at this point—its market capitalization now tops $126 billion—lesser-known opportunities are popping up for those investors paying close attention. One such play is  IAC/InterActiveCorp . ’s Vimeo, a video hosting and sharing platform used by a growing number of Shopify’s customers, among many others, to easily and effectively help tell their story and increase conversion online.<br />IAC said Vimeo raised $150 million in early November in an oversubscribed equity offering from outside investors that valued its software-as-a-service company at $2.75 billion. That implies big potential for a company that is currently operating at a $300 million annual revenue run rate implied by its third-quarter results.<br />For investors looking to turn movies into money, opportunity may soon knock. IAC said earlier this month it is considering a full spinoff of Vimeo, which would make it the 11th public company to come from IAC’s golden breeding grounds. Fostered by the very hands that helped turn public companies such as Expedia Group and Match Group into behemoths in their own right, Vimeo’s business was already accelerating before the pandemic. Its organic bookings growth consistently accelerated last year from 11% in the first quarter to 27% by the fourth quarter of 2019 according to IAC.</td>

      <td>Joe Rogan’s podcast, about to go exclusive, will need to deliver a big boost in paid users to justify the stock’s run</td>
      <td>Joe Rogan has raised some eyebrows at  Spotify .  The question remains if he can bend many new ears—especially those willing to pay for the experience.<br />The mega-popular podcaster moved his show to the streaming platform on Sept. 1, per a deal valued at more than $100 million struck earlier in the year. Spotify has been hot on podcasts of late. It has also struck recent deals with Kim Kardashian and the DC Comics brand, and has made several acquisitions to beef up its podcast platform. This includes a $235 million outlay earlier this month for Megaphone, which provides production and advertising services to podcasters.<br />But the deal with Mr. Rogan is the most closely watched, as it brings an established star with a huge and dedicated following. It also brings a fair dose of heat, given Mr. Rogan’s penchant for booking highly controversial guests such as talk-radio host Alex Jones. A recent appearance by the latter sparked some consternation even among Spotify employees, who debated internally whether that show and others met the company’s content guidelines. Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek addressed the matter on the company’s third-quarter call last month, affirming the need to apply content policies evenly. “If we can’t do that, then there are other choices for a lot of creators to go to,” he said.<br />The company will learn soon whether Mr. Rogan’s show is truly worth the trouble. The program becomes exclusive to Spotify in December, which means the company’s fourth-quarter results will be the first to reflect any change in usage or revenue from the show’s fans who won’t be able to get it elsewhere. But the types of users will matter as well. Spotify’s most recent results showed a bigger jump in users for its free, advertising-driven service compared to subscribers for the premium tier. The company added 15 million users for the free tier, compared with six million premium subscribers in the third quarter. The company’s forecast implies similar outsize growth for the ad-driven tier in the fourth quarter.<br />Simply adding ears for advertising won’t be enough for Spotify to justify the investments it has made in podcasts—and the market-value boost the company has so far gotten for its effort. Despite some slippage since the third-quarter report on Oct. 29, Spotify’s shares are still up 67% since the deal with Mr. Rogan was announced in May.</td>

      <td>Rising stock indexes suggest investors are breathing a sigh of relief right now. Wall Street’s fear gauge says otherwise, though.<br />Stocks have soared back to records, fueled by optimism about a coming vaccine for the novel coronavirus as well as relief that the election—widely anticipated for months—has passed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has rallied 12.7% in November, on track for its strongest month since 1987. The S&P 500 has advanced 11% this month and hit a high on Tuesday.<br />Although market volatility has edged lower in recent days, the Cboe Volatility Index has hovered above 20 since Feb. 24, marking 194 consecutive trading sessions above that threshold. That is the longest such streak since one ending in 2009 during the financial crisis, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The gauge is based on options prices tied to the S&P 500 and tends to fall as stocks are rising.<br />The VIX at an elevated level signals investors remain cautious despite a stock market that is flying high, with concerns lingering that the volatility that gripped markets earlier in the year could return. It also reflects elevated prices for options bets tied to the S&P 500, which investors often tap to hedge portfolios or make directional bets on stocks.<br />The stretch is remarkable because it includes a period in which U.S. stocks tumbled into a bear market—defined as a drop of at least 20%—before rebounding back toward new highs. Despite the recent ascent for stocks, the elevated VIX signals some anxiety about the market’s path. Since Feb. 24, the S&P 500 has gained about 12.5%.</td>

Drivers could enjoy the benefits sooner than manufacturers.<br />So-called connected cars aren’t new: The majority of vehicles sold in the U.S. today and almost half globally are already fitted with a modem. But vehicle electronics are only now being reconfigured to take full advantage of fast mobile broadband, notably to deliver smartphone-style updates “over the air.” This is a game-changer.<br />Take the  Ford  F-150, the bestselling vehicle in the U.S. since 1981. The new generation now arriving in showrooms debuts a new Ford-built software tech stack that will bring the kind of capabilities consumers are used to in smartphones. A “central brain” will deploy updates around the vehicle to fix bugs or add features, says Stuart Taylor, Ford’s head of connectivity. After launching on the F-150, the system will go into Ford’s other key new products, the Mustang Mach-E and revived 2021 Bronco.<br />More new vehicles will, like the Ford-150, have a crucial difference from their predecessors: They will improve even after leaving the dealership. For drivers, this promises to bring down the curtain on clunky infotainment systems that feel out of date even when new.</td>
