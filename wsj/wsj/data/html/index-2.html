The former vice president has picked Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton University labor economist, to be chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, these people said.<br />The president-elect has selected Adewale “Wally” Adeyemo, a former senior international economic adviser during the Obama administration, to serve as Ms. Yellen’s top deputy at the Treasury Department. And he will turn to two campaign economic advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, to serve as members of the CEA alongside Ms. Rouse, the people said.<br />Mr. Biden’s selections include outspoken advocates for aggressive fiscal stimulus to help return the economy quickly to its pre-pandemic health, a cause that could run into resistance in a closely divided Congress. The advisers are also known for advocating expanded government spending they say would boost the economy’s long-term potential, in areas that are liberal priorities such as education, infrastructure and the green economy, and policy changes aimed at narrowing racial disparities in the economy.<br />Several of the choices, including Ms. Rouse, Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Adeyemo, are former Obama administration officials who played key roles in the aftermath of the financial crisis.</td>

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Nov. 19 recommended people not travel over Thanksgiving.<br />The number of travelers from Nov. 25 through Nov. 29 was down more than 10% from a record set last year, according to AAA, which includes flights and road trips of more than 50 miles. Airlines, which boosted capacity earlier in the month only to trim flying when cancellations started to climb in recent weeks, said traveler numbers were in line with their revised expectations.<br />The Transportation Security Administration said that its workers screened more than 964,000 people on Saturday, down 37% from a year earlier, and more than a million on Nov. 25, the busiest flying day since March. TSA said that it expected screenings on Sunday to be higher than that.<br />Travel flows were helped by the lack of winter storms that blighted travel last year, triggering thousands of scrubbed flights in the Northeast and on down the East Coast. Only around 200 flights were scrubbed across the country over the weekend, with the total number of flights down by around a half from a year ago.</td>

To overcome customer skittishness about ordering shoes without trying them on first, Zappos offered free shipping and free returns, giving customers as long as a year to send back unwanted products. Customers could order dozens of pairs of shoes and keep only those they liked—a policy that set a high bar for rivals.<br />The Harvard-educated chief executive, whose parents were immigrants from Taiwan, also insisted on keeping his call center in the U.S. rather than outsourcing it to an overseas supplier that might not meet his exacting standards. Instead of being compensated for handling a high number of calls quickly, Zappos employees were encouraged to spend hours on the line with a single customer if that’s what it took to reach satisfaction.</td>
