    "body": "ROME—Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned Tuesday, ushering in a phase of political instability that could lead either a new government or to elections this spring.<br />The breakdown of Italy’s left-leaning government comes as the country, like most of the Western world, is struggling to control the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, vaccinate its population and rekindle economic growth.<br />The Italian leader’s fall also shows that Europe’s political challenges of recent years—including the fragmentation of the political landscape and the rise of antiestablishment parties—haven’t gone away, despite the pressure that the pandemic is putting on European politicians to work together across party lines.<br />Mr. Conte stepped down after losing his majority in Italy’s Senate earlier this month, following a fight with a small coalition ally over how to spend massive funds offered by the European Union to help Italy’s economy recover from the impact of the pandemic.<br />Italy’s head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, will start political consultations with parties in Parliament to test whether a new governing majority can be found. Possible scenarios include a government under a new prime minister, or another coalition led by Mr. Conte."
