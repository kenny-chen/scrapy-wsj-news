    "body": "On Tuesday  the American people will learn two things from Georgia’s Senate runoffs. One is whether Donald Trump, amid all his election controversies, can rally his troops in numbers sufficient to put Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue over the top. The other is whether Joe Biden has any coattails.<br />Thus far attention on Georgia has focused on President Trump, and for good reason. Not only did he lose a state that hasn’t gone for a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1992, he’s now made himself the main issue in the two Senate runoffs. And the outcome will affect all Americans, because it will determine whether the Biden agenda will sail through a Democratic Congress or be blocked and tempered by a Republican Senate.<br />But there’s been zero attention on the equally compelling question about Mr. Biden: Can he carry Democrats other than himself to victory?<br />The November election suggests he can’t. Start with the Senate, which Democrats were favored to win. Instead, they  have 48 seats, so they need to sweep both Senate runoffs to get to a 50-50 tie in which Kamala Harris would then cast the deciding vote.<br />Democrats fared even worse in the House. Though expectations were that Democrats would pick up seats, Republican victories narrowed Nancy Pelosi’s Democratic majority to 11 votes from 37. Having Mr. Biden on the ticket may have helped Democrats such as Pennsylvania’s Conor Lamb eke out victories in more moderate districts, but the Biden-led blue wave proved a dud."
