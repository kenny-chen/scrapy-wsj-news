    "body": "WASHINGTON—On the first day of this session of Congress, every single House Republican rallied behind Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in their vote for House speaker.<br />Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) ultimately won her fourth term as House speaker. However, it was a high-water mark of GOP support for the California Republican, whose unwavering alliance with President Trump and unexpected string of House GOP wins on Election Night brought him closer than ever before to his longtime goal of becoming speaker of the House.<br />Now, just 10 days later, Mr. McCarthy faces tensions within the House GOP and doubts in some Republican quarters about his own leadership over his refusal to publicly challenge Mr. Trump and his support for disputing President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral victory after a violent mob of Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.<br />The question for both Mr. McCarthy and his party as a whole is whether the path back to power leads through spurning Mr. Trump, or continuing to embrace him. In a previously unthinkable move, Mr. McCarthy was asking other Republicans whether he should press Mr. Trump to resign, according to someone familiar with the discussions.<br />“This is more than an inflection point for the Republican Party and specifically House Republicans,” said former GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida. The force of Mr. McCarthy’s personal charisma and deep relationships are “by far his greatest asset and it’s very powerful,” he said. “He has survived past challenges, but this is a low point in our country and he’s in the middle of it.”"
