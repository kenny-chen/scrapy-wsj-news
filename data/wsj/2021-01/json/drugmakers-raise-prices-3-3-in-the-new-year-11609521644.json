The drug industry normally sets prices for its therapies at the start of the year and again in the middle of the year.<br />In all, about 70 drugmakers raised prices in the U.S. on Friday, according to an analysis from Rx Savings Solutions, which sells software to help employers and health plans choose the least-expensive medicines. The average increase of 3.3% included changes to different doses for the same drug, according to the analysis. Inflation registered at 1.2% for the most recent 12 months.<br />This yearâ€™s average is lower than that of a year ago, when more than 60 companies raised the prices on hundreds of drugs by an average of 5.8%, according to the analysis. However, it found that companies raised prices on at least 50% more products compared with last year."
