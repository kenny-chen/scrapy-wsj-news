    "body": "A Queens mall was evacuated Monday morning after a vehicle containing a fake bomb was reported in a parking garage there, New York Police Department officials said.<br />The officials said the NYPD Bomb Squad and Emergency Service Unit officers were dispatched shortly after 7:40 a.m. to Queens Place Mall in the Elmhurst section of the borough after a 911 caller reported a Tesla vehicle that apparently contained propane tanks connected to a battery.<br />A preliminary investigation determined the tanks didnâ€™t constitute a threat, the officials said. However, investigators determined the items found in the vehicle constituted a hoax bomb intended to cause a disruption, according to police officials.<br />A spokeswoman for Queens Place Mall said the mall remained closed Monday while police and the New York Fire Department continued their investigation.<br />The investigation led to the closure of nearby roads for roughly two hours. The evacuation orders and road closures began to be lifted around 10 a.m., police officials said."
