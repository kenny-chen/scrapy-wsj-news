    "body": "TOKYO—The chief executive of Japan’s  Sumitomo Corp.  was scrolling through emails on his iPhone late one night when he noticed one from Warren Buffett’s company. Masayuki Hyodo thought it looked like an ad, but he opened it just in case, then tapped on the PDF attachment.<br />Before Mr. Hyodo’s eyes was a personal letter signed by the American investing legend. Mr. Buffett wrote that his company,  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,  was about to announce that it had acquired 5% of Sumitomo’s shares, part of its biggest investment in Japan.<br />“It was totally unexpected,” Mr. Hyodo said of the late-August disclosure. “He is such a distinguished investor, so it’s an honor.”<br />Mr. Buffett spent about $6 billion taking 5% stakes in five Japanese investment companies including Sumitomo, whose roots date back 430 years.<br />What has become clear since the investments is that the 90-year-old Mr. Buffett and Sumitomo have something in common beyond a venerable history. Both are out of fashion with investors these days."
