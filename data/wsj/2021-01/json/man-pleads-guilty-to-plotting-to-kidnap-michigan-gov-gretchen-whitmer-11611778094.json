    "body": "One of six men charged in an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiracy, admitting that the group discussed a scheme to snatch her at her lakeside vacation home and destroy a bridge to slow down police.<br />Ty Garbin’s guilty plea is a major catch for prosecutors, about four months after arrests were made. His testimony would strengthen the government’s case against the others and back up evidence collected by informants and undercover agents.<br />Mr. Garbin appeared in federal court in Grand Rapids a few hours after prosecutors filed a plea agreement with details about the operation and his pledge to cooperate fully with investigators. There is no agreement on his sentencing.<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation in October said it broke up a plot to kidnap Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat, by antigovernment extremists upset over the coronavirus restrictions she imposed in Michigan. Six people were charged in federal court while eight others were charged in state court with aiding the alleged scheme.<br />In the plea agreement, Mr. Garbin, 25 years old, of Hartland, admitted to more than six pages of allegations. He said he and others trained with weapons in Munith, Mich., and Cambria, Wis., last summer and “discussed the plan to storm the Capitol and kidnap the governor.”"
