    "body": "Chinese regulators are effectively breaking up Ant Group’s fin-tech empire, and there’s a lesson here for investors. Ant’s deconstruction is a reminder that businesses in China live or die at the sufferance of the Communist Party.<br />Jack Ma founded Ant in 2004 as “Alipay” to process payments for his e-commerce site Alibaba. He exploited the credit shortages in China’s state-dominated banking system by expanding into financial services such as insurance, money-management, personal credit ratings and consumer loans.<br />Party leaders tolerated Ant because it helped fuel their goal of making China’s economy more consumer-driven. But regulators have slapped down Ant at times when they think it is threatening the government’s control of capital—for instance, by limiting returns on Ant money-market funds that had drawn deposits from state banks.<br />Global investors in 2018 bought stakes in Ant—then valued at about $150 billion—to capitalize on China’s growth and government restrictions on foreign competition. Mr. Ma aimed to raise another $34 billion in an initial public offering, with estimates of Ant’s potential valuation at more than $300 billion.<br />The entrepreneur planned to launch the IPO on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges, which would draw more foreign capital to Chinese markets. But in October Mr. Ma apparently forgot he was in China and criticized Beijing’s financial controls. Regulators abruptly halted Ant’s IPO and presented Mr. Ma with a litany of vague grievances."
