    "body": "Even with the 737 MAX crisis mostly out of the way,  Boeing  might struggle to gain altitude.<br />The troubled U.S. plane maker’s shares have fallen a lot since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, but hardly more than those of key rival  Airbus .  This suggests that investors don’t see Boeing’s disadvantage extending much beyond the grounding of the MAX, the impact of which was baked into the company’s stock price before the outbreak. It is a risky assumption.<br />Fourth-quarter earnings show why the gulf between the companies could in fact get larger—despite a return to service of the MAX, which was cleared to fly by European regulators on Wednesday.<br />The Chicago-based plane maker on Wednesday reported its biggest-ever annual loss. Investors broadly expected it, but were still disappointed by the final tally: Losses for the fourth quarter of 2020 came in at $8.4 billion, compared with analysts’ expectations of about $500 million.<br />This was in part the result of a $6.5 billion pretax charge Boeing took on its 777X wide-body plane program. The company has now pushed its first delivery all the way back to 2023—making it three years late. The 777X has been affected by the pandemic, but also the assumption that regulators will take much longer to certify new jets after the MAX fiasco."
