    "body": "Tom Brady has been to nine Super Bowls, won six and is one game from something that’s never been done in NFL history: playing a Super Bowl at home.<br />It’s already been a season of firsts for the 43-year-old. It’s his first season with a team other than the New England Patriots. It’s his first season playing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.<br />Now, he can help the Bucs become the first team ever to play the season’s final game in their home stadium.<br />First, Brady has to take his team past Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers in Sunday’s NFC Championship, which is far from a guarantee. The Packers have been the NFC’s best team this year, while Rodgers has been the NFL’s best quarterback.<br />If the Buccaneers prevail, though, they’ll find themselves playing next in familiar confines: Raymond James Stadium, site of the Super Bowl on Feb. 7. Tampa Bay plays all of its home games there in front of a kitschy fake pirate ship armed with replica cannons."
