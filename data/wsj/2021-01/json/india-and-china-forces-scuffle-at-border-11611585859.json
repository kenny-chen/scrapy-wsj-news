    "body": "NEW DELHI—Indian and Chinese security forces had a scuffle along their disputed border in the Himalayas last week, the Indian army said Monday, in a development that could potentially escalate tensions and damage peace talks between the two countries.<br />Troops from the two nuclear-armed neighbors have been in eyeball-to-eyeball mode since last year following a deadly hand-to-hand combat in June that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers in the eastern Ladakh region.<br />Since then, the two most-populous countries on the planet have deployed tens of thousands of troops, artillery and howitzers along their disputed borders that stretches from Ladakh to the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh.<br />The Indian army played down the latest skirmish, which happened on Jan. 20 near the high-altitude Nakula Pass in the northeastern Indian state of Sikkim, calling it a minor face-off.<br />The incident “was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols,” said the Indian army, which warned the media from “overplaying or exaggerating reports.”"
