    "body": "Voter concern over the public handling of the Covid-19 pandemic is one reason Joe Biden is the 46th president of the United States. Translation: Mr. Biden is the dog that caught the Covid bus. Now what?<br />The U.S.’s miraculously quick development of several vaccines was supposed to be deliverance from the coronavirus nightmare and will be in time. For now, widespread failures with distribution of the vaccines have created a second nightmare of unavailable or discarded doses, crashing websites, and callers on hold forever. Personal doctors are out of the loop.<br />The now-mandatory conventional wisdom posits that the failure is because the Trump administration did not create a national plan to coordinate inoculations. Joe Biden says his plan, which in most respects sounds like the Operation Warp Speed plan, will vaccinate 100 million people in 100 days. That is the voice of a government lifer.<br />Blaming the vaccine rollout’s problems on the Trump administration is myopic. The failure is deeper; it is systemic and goes back years. Indeed easily as far back as Mr. Biden’s favorite template, the Obama administration.<br />The word most often invoked around the vaccinations is “coordination”—that the distribution “lacks coordination.”"
