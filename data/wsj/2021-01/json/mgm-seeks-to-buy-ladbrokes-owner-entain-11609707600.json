    "body": "MGM Resorts International  is seeking to buy British gaming company  Entain  PLC, according to people familiar with the matter, in the latest move by a casino operator to double down on the red-hot online-gambling business.<br />MGM recently made an offer to buy the owner of the popular British gambling brand Ladbrokes, which has a market value of about $9 billion, the people said. The offer, which would have a substantial stock component, comes after an earlier, roughly $10 billion all-cash overture was rebuffed. The new bid comes with financial backing from the MGM’s largest shareholder,  IAC/InterActiveCorp . , the people said.<br />The exact details and value of the new bid couldn’t be learned, but it is above the £12.85 a share MGM had previously offered late last year, the people said. There is no guarantee Entain will be receptive to the new offer or that there will be a deal.<br />A combination could create one of the few large gaming companies in the world with a significant online and bricks-and-mortar presence. It would come on the heels of other recent consolidation in the industry.<br />Like its peers, MGM has been under pressure as the coronavirus pandemic kept its biggest moneymakers—casinos and hotels on the Las Vegas Strip—closed or operating at sharply reduced capacity for much of the year."
