    "body": "Visa Inc.  is abandoning its $5.3 billion planned acquisition of  Plaid Inc.,  a key player in the financial-technology space, in the face of a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit that challenged the deal.<br />The department sued to block the deal in November alleging the acquisition would allow Visa to unlawfully maintain a monopoly in the online debit-card market. Plaid, the government argued, was a nascent but important competitive threat to Visa, and eliminating that threat would lead to Â higher prices, less innovation and higher entry barriers for online debit services.<br />Visa initially vowed to fight the government, and a trial was scheduled for June in a California federal court.<br />Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com and AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com"
