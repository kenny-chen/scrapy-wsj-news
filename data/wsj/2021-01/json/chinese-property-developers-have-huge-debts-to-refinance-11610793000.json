    "body": "China’s property developers have a mountain of international debt to refinance this year, and tight lending conditions are raising the risk of defaults.<br />The real-estate firms need to repay up to $53.5 billion of offshore debt this year, a sharp increase from the $25.4 billion that came due in 2020, according to CreditSights, a bond-research firm. The bulk of the debt—$47.6 billion—is dollar bonds. The CreditSights figures include maturing bonds and a smaller sum of puttable debt, which has a longer maturity but which investors have the right to sell back during 2021.<br />At the same time, support from China’s powerful state banks is waning, profits are still recovering after tumbling in the early phase of the pandemic and regulators are taking a tougher stance on financial risk in the sector.<br />To further complicate matters, international defaults by Chinese borrowers, including some smaller real-estate firms, have grown more common in recent years. And a spate of defaults late last year by state-linked companies rattled investors in China’s huge onshore bond market, where property developers are also active borrowers in yuan.<br />While yields are high compared with many other investments, analysts and investors say the market is likely to draw sharp distinctions between healthier and weaker borrowers."
