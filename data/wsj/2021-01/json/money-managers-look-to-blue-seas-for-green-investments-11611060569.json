    "body": "LONDON—After two decades hauling cement and fuel to oil rigs in the North Sea, Atlantic Discovery faced the end of the line in 2015 when energy markets crashed and the ship was dispatched to an Edinburgh scrapyard.<br />Now the vessel is back plying the waves under a new owner. Tricked out with high-lift cranes and an upgraded positioning system, it started servicing the U.K.’s offshore wind farms in 2019.<br />Atlantic Discovery is one of a growing number of vessels catering to offshore wind farms, which are proliferating as the world reduces its reliance on fossil fuels. The need to finance the ships has lured money managers chasing investments that check the environmentally friendly box and provide yield. Their interest suggests appetite for cleaner investments extends beyond the ubiquitous green bonds of recent years.<br />Ships clear the seabed of debris, lay foundations and build turbines—often far from shore in treacherous conditions. A financing gap exists because banks have pulled back from the shipping industry after losses since the 2008-09 financial crisis.<br />Galya Petkova sees this in her job at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA, leasing vessels to service turbines. She is encountering more private funds that own or finance ships compared with three years ago, she says."
