    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden has a stronger shot at advancing his legislative agenda through a divided Senate after two runoff victories in Georgia gave Democrats control of the chamber.<br />Democrat Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff won Senate seats in Tuesday’s runoff elections, giving each party 50 Senate seats at the start of Mr. Biden’s presidency. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris could break any tie.<br />That gives Democrats control of both the House and Senate and elevates Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) to majority leader for the first time in his career. The incoming president will be positioned to push for a more ambitious spending package aimed at taming the coronavirus pandemic and bolstering the economy, two central themes of his 2020 campaign against President Trump. And he will be more likely to see his chosen cabinet members confirmed quickly.<br />Mr. Biden said in a statement that the Georgia results showed that voters wanted action on an array of issues and that he remained committed to working with Republicans to find consensus.<br />“After the past four years, after the election, and after today’s election certification proceedings on the Hill, it’s time to turn the page,” Mr. Biden said. “The American people demand action and they want unity. I am more optimistic than I ever have been that we can deliver both.”"
