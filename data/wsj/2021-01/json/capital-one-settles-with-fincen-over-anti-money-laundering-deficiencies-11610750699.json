    "body": "The Treasury Department on Friday said it fined  Capital One  Financial Corp. for “willfully failing to implement and maintain” effective anti-money-laundering controls.<br />As part of the settlement, Capital One admitted that it “willfully failed to file thousands of suspicious-activity reports,” according to the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The allegations pertain to a check-cashing group that Capital One acquired when it bought North Fork Bank in 2006.<br />FinCEN said it had assessed a $390 million penalty but that it agreed to give Capital One credit for a $100 million penalty it paid to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2018. The OCC is an independent branch of the Treasury.<br />Capital One also acknowledged that its actions violated the Bank Secrecy Act. Financial institutions are required to work with the government to detect and prevent money laundering.<br />The allegations cover practices between at least 2008 and 2014, the same year Capital One exited the check-cashing business."
