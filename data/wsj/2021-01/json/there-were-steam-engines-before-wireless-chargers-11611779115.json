    "body": "Regarding “Wireless Charging Fuels Electric-Car Hopes” (Business & Finance, Jan. 19): A similar problem faced the railroad industry in the 19th and early 20th centuries.<br />Steam locomotives were the darlings of technology and absolutely anything that could deliver passengers and freight faster and faster to their destinations was tested. But a train had to stop at a water tower (charging station) when it ran low, sitting there, waiting a long time to be refilled. Civil engineers working for the railroads came up with under-way (without stopping) water replacement. To accomplish this, trenches were built in the railroad bed and filled with water. As the train passed, it sucked up the water without slowing down.<br />Modifying the train, the tracks, the plumbing and the labor required enormous costs paid for by the railroad—not the taxpayer.<br />Ecclesiastes 1:9: Nothing under the sun is new.<br />Thomas Kolber"
