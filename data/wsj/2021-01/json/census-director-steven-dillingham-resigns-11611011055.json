    "body": "WASHINGTON—Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham said Monday he plans to resign, days after a government watchdog questioned his requests for data relating to the Trump administration’s push to exclude unauthorized immigrants from a key aspect of the decennial count.<br />Mr. Dillingham’s resignation is effective Wednesday, he wrote in a post to employees on the Census Bureau site in which he praised their work and dedication. He said he would have left earlier, but a transition official for President-elect Joe Biden invited him to continue serving as bureau director, and “under other circumstances” he would have been honored to stay in his post under the new president.<br />Mr. Dillingham’s resignation comes after the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General issued a memo that raised concerns about his directive for career officials to produce a report that “includes data on documented and undocumented persons in the United States.” Career officials said they were “under significant pressure to produce this technical report,” the OIG memo said.<br />The memo inquired how Mr. Dillingham would ensure the data quality of the report and why the Census Bureau director prioritized the report.<br />Mr. Dillingham addressed the inspector general’s memo at length in his resignation announcement. Mr. Dillingham defended the data request and said it “was not an attempt to release 2020 census data results for apportionment early.”"
