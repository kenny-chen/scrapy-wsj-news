    "body": "The NBA is facing the first major Covid-19 test of its new season with cases spiking, games teetering and more than two dozen players on 13 teams in quarantine or isolation over the weekend as the league struggles to keep playing through the worst days of the pandemic.<br />The league postponed the Boston Celtics vs. Miami Heat game scheduled for Sunday night after contact tracing left the Heat without the eight players needed to field a team and the Celtics barely had enough themselves.<br />The second postponement of the season came on a chaotic weekend when almost half of the league’s teams found themselves dealing with Covid-related issues.<br />The disruptions started with the Philadelphia 76ers being forced to play on Saturday with just eight active players, the minimum required by the league to avoid a postponement, after Sixers guard Seth Curry tested positive for the virus on Thursday and four teammates in close contact were ruled out while quarantining.<br />But the messy uncertainty in Philadelphia, where the game appeared to be jeopardy hours before the tip, wasn’t the only challenge for the NBA less than one month into a turbulent season that was expected to be highly volatile once the league chose to leave a controlled bubble environment for the risks of the real world."
