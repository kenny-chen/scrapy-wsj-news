    "body": "Anthony Fauci, who is serving as President Biden’s chief medical adviser for the Covid-19 pandemic, is reprising a role he has played in previous U.S. administrations over four decades, on issues including AIDS and the Ebola virus.<br />The nation’s top government infectious-disease doctor will advise the president on Covid-19 and other medical issues while keeping his day job as director of the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.<br />“I think President Biden will look to me to be essentially an adviser as part of a team of medical experts who are doing their jobs full-time,” Dr. Fauci said in a brief interview between White House and other meetings on Thursday. Advising presidents, he said, “takes different forms depending on what the circumstances at hand are.”<br />Dr. Fauci, whose once-frequent appearances at White House briefings last year tailed off in the final months of the Trump administration, was back in the spotlight Thursday to brief reporters on the new administration’s Covid-19 strategy.<br />In response to a reporter’s question, Dr. Fauci said it was a “liberating feeling” to be working for the new administration, acknowledging that appearing at press briefings with former President Donald Trump was often uncomfortable as Mr. Trump embraced remedies such as use of hydroxychloroquine on limited evidence."
