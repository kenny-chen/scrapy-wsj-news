    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s national security team foresees a rocky road in pursuing one of his principal foreign policy promises: persuading Iran to return to the 2015 nuclear deal and then pressing for a follow-on accord that sets tougher limits.<br />The new administration jump-started its diplomatic agenda in its first days in office by extending the New Start nuclear arms-control treaty with Russia and rejoining both the Paris climate accord and the United Nations’ World Health Organization.<br />But its hopes to coax Iran back into the nuclear accord are a far thornier prospect, with U.S. sanctions policy potentially posing an early diplomatic obstacle.<br />The U.S., under the terms of the 2015 accord, agreed to ease a specific set of sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in exchange for constraints on Iran’s nuclear program. Separate U.S. sanctions, levied against Iran under authorities targeting terrorism, ballistic-missile development and human rights abuses, weren’t part of the nuclear deal.<br />“If Iran comes back into compliance, we would, too,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was confirmed to his post by senators on Tuesday, testified last week."
