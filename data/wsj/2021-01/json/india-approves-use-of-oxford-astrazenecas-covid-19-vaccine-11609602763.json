    "body": "NEW DELHI—India has authorized the Covid-19 vaccine from the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC, kick-starting global use of an inoculation that is expected to be embraced by developing countries given its lower price and ease of transport compared with other front-runners.<br />India’s information and broadcasting minister, Prakash Javadekar, said Saturday that the vaccine, which was developed in the U.K., has received permission for emergency usage.<br />“Last year began with corona. This year has begun with a vaccine,” he said at a news briefing in New Delhi on Saturday.<br />The U.K. authorized the vaccine earlier this week, and India is one of the first countries to follow suit.<br />The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could be a good fit for India and other developing countries thanks to its price, convenience and expected global reach. AstraZeneca has promised to make as many as three billion doses available in 2021—more than any other Covid-19 vaccine maker—and at a cheaper price."
