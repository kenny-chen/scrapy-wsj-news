    "body": "Breaking News<br />The FBI has opened more than 160 case files in connection with last week’s deadly pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol, officials said Tuesday, announcing that prosecutors are looking at bringing potential seditious conspiracy charges against members of the mob.<br />(Article below will update)<br />Officials from the FBI and Justice Department are giving lawmakers their first formal briefings Tuesday on last week’s deadly pro-Trump riot at the Capitol. Notably absent are their bosses—Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and FBI Director Christopher Wray—who have kept a very low public profile for almost a week.<br />The acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, and the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Washington office, Steven D’Antuono, who are running the sprawling probe, will speak by phone with lawmakers, people familiar with the matter said. The briefing comes as Washington grapples with ongoing security concerns and threats of future violence, and as agents fan out across the country to tackle an investigation with thousands of suspects and crimes ranging from murder to stealing national-security information."
