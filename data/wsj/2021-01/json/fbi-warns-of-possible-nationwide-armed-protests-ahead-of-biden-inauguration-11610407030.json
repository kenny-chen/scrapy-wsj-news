    "body": "The FBI is warning in an internal memo of the possibility of armed protests at all 50 state capitols and in Washington, D.C., ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration, a law-enforcement official said.<br />The memo warns demonstrations may start later this week and continue through the inauguration, the official said, as federal agencies brace for the possibility of more violence following Wednesday’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol.<br />The National Park Service, citing the continuing danger from violent groups, said Monday it has closed facilities, parking areas and roadways in Washington, and is restricting access to the Washington Monument.<br />Ahead of last week’s attack, FBI agents had been concerned that specific people planning to attend the pro-Trump protest posed potential threats and discouraged some of them from traveling to Washington, but had no intelligence of a wider coordinated plot that would warrant a formal threat assessment, law-enforcement officials said Monday.<br />Officials believed that a formal intelligence bulletin—a document that alerts law enforcement to patterns or trends—wasn’t necessary in advance of what they expected to be a mostly peaceful political rally with some violent agitators."
