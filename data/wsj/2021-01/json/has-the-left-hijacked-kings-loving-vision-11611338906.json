    "body": "Robert L. Woodson Sr. and Joshua Mitchell fail to present a convincing case that the left has hijacked the struggle for civil rights (“How the Left Hijacked Civil Rights,” op-ed, Jan. 16). They claim many black leaders reject the country’s founding principles. Not so. What many modern black leaders do is shine a bright light on the gross hypocrisy of declaring “all men are created equal” while tolerating slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarceration, lynchings and general discrimination both social and governmental throughout our history.<br />The authors state that the radical left has been working to keep blacks in a constant state of agitation. It isn’t the so-called “radical left” that has prompted this agitation but the reality of a long list of incidents of police killings of unarmed African-Americans.<br />Messrs. Woodson and Mitchell also decry the left’s supposed rejection of “bourgeois self-restraint and discipline” and support for “indulging in the passions of the moment.” Some African-Americans who were raised in poverty and an environment of mass incarceration conclude what’s best is living for the moment; this is understandable when many in their community are either dead or in jail before they are 30. This phenomenon is an indictment of our social structure, not of those who experience or point it out.<br />Joseph Kaufman<br />Seattle"
