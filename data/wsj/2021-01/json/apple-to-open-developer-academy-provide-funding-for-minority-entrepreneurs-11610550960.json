    "body": "Apple Inc.  is launching several projects to extend education and funding opportunities to minority entrepreneurs, part of the $100 million pledge it made in June to help combat racism in response to the national outcry over the killing of George Floyd.<br />The iPhone maker on Wednesday said it would open a software-developer academy in Detroit later this year and launch two venture-funding initiatives for young “Black and Brown entrepreneurs,” with the goal of helping to build the next generation of diverse leaders.<br />“We are all accountable to the urgent work of building a more just, more equitable world,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said. “And these new projects send a clear signal of Apple’s enduring commitment.”<br />Last year, Apple and fellow tech titan  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google, banks such as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. ,  toy company  Hasbro Inc.  and others collectively pledged tens of billions of dollars toward racial-equity efforts. The moves came after Mr. Floyd, a Black man, was killed by police in May, inciting a national debate about systemic racism.<br />At the time, the companies said the money they pledged would go toward boosting the net worth of Black families, creating professional opportunities for minorities and diversifying their own ranks, among other outcomes."
