In 2020, it is a mark of resilience, as strong exports and success in containing Covid-19 buoyed Asian economies against one of the worst global downturns in modern history.<br />The drop in gross domestic product, reported by the Bank of Korea on Tuesday, is expected to be one of the smallest among major economies, according to estimates from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.<br />The relative economic strength is reflected across Asia, where China finished the year with 2.3% growth and Vietnam at 2.9%. Taiwan is expected to report a 1.9% expansion for the year Friday, according to Fitch Solutions.<br />The Bank of Korea attributed South Korea’s relative economic durability during the pandemic to its large manufacturing industry, well-established online shopping base and strong pandemic-response measures.<br />“The recovery of global demand for our mainstream products like semiconductors in the second half of the year contributed to the economic cushioning,” said Park Yang-su, director general at the Bank of Korea’s economics statistics department."
