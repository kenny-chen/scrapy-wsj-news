Hunting isn’t a sport, it’s a violent and unnecessary form of entertainment. Hunters cause animals unimaginable suffering, especially when you consider that multiple studies have found that bow hunters wound but don’t kill their targets about half the time. They tear families apart, orphan the young and, for animals including wolves and geese who mate for life and live in close-knit family groups, destroy entire communities. And animals don’t need hunters to manage their herds. Deer reproduce based on food and habitat availability, so when more resources become available due to hunting, deer multiply at higher rates. Natural predators do help maintain healthy populations, selecting the sickest and weakest animals. But hunters go after the largest set of antlers to hang on their walls. “Game” managers also frequently kill off natural predators to ensure plenty of targets for hunters to shoot at.<br />Michelle Kretzer<br />People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Foundation<br />Norfolk, Va.<br />"
