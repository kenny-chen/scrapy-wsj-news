    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday considered expanding the financial liability that public colleges and other government entities can face for infringing free-speech rights, even after they repeal restrictions challenged as unconstitutional.<br />In 2016, a student at Georgia Gwinnett College began passing out religious literature on a campus plaza, only to be stopped by a police officer who told him to reserve one of two tiny so-called speech zones for such activities. Later, when the student did so, he said, another officer stopped him from speaking because of complaints over his remarks.<br />The student, Chike Uzuegbunam, sued the Lawrenceville, Ga., school for violating his First Amendment rights. College administrators reversed course, opening the entire campus to student speech with minimal restrictions, and a federal judge dismissed the case as moot. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, upheld that decision.<br />That left Mr. Uzuegbunam, who since has graduated, without a dollar in compensation from the college—and, a dollar, what courts call nominal compensation, is what he was seeking. More significantly, it frustrated the advocacy group representing him, Alliance Defending Freedom, from collecting attorneys’ fees and costs from the school.<br />In that the policy had been rescinded and Mr. Uzuegbunam obtained his degree, several justices questioned whether there were any grounds for damages."
