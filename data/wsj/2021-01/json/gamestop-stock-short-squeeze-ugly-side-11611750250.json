    "body": "Andrew Left is no stranger to conflict when it comes to investing. He makes a living betting that companies will stumble, and he calls out executives by name.<br />Companies and their supporters fight back, but the criticism he normally gets is nothing compared with the venom spewed in recent days by stock traders who have come together online to drive up shares of an unlikely momentum stock, mall retailer  GameStop Corp.<br />“It makes you feel vulnerable,” Mr. Left, 50, founder of Citron Research, said in an interview. “We live in a world where we’re all exposed and people don’t understand boundaries.”<br />The angry traders have shared his personal information, hacked into Mr. Left’s social-media accounts and texted Mr. Left and his two children, using threatening, profane and personal language, according to people close to the matter.<br />Other short sellers have also been targeted in these forums. In the past week, there has been an uptick in references to well-known short sellers like Mr. Left and Muddy Waters LLC’s Carson Block on Reddit channels, blogs and other social-media venues, according to a review by  Meltwater ,  a global media intelligence company."
