    "body": "SEOUL—A former North Korean ambassador has been quietly living in South Korea for more than a year, two aides to a Seoul lawmaker said, adding to the ranks of Pyongyang’s senior diplomats who are known to have defected in recent years.<br />Ryu Hyon U was Pyongyang’s acting ambassador to Kuwait before entering South Korea in September 2019, aides to South Korean lawmaker Tae Young Ho said Monday.<br />He joins more high-ranking diplomats who have defected to South Korea in recent years, including Mr. Tae, who was elected to Seoul’s legislature last year after defecting in 2016 while serving as the deputy chief of North Korea’s Embassy in London. Mr. Ryu’s defection in 2019 occurred just two months after Pyongyang’s acting ambassador to Rome, Jo Song Gil, defected to Seoul.<br />The number of recent ambassador-level defections from North Korea shows Kim Jong Un’s control over the regime’s bureaucracy may not be as strong as his father’s or grandfather’s, said Cheon Seong-whun, a former South Korean national security official. However, he cautioned against reading too much into the defections as a sign of the regime’s fragility.<br />“We should be wary of interpreting the series of defections as a sign of weakness of the Kim Jong Un regime,” Mr. Cheon said. Most North Koreans have a tendency to rally around their leader against outside pressure, he said."
