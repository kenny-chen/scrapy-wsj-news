    "body": "Regarding Michael Segal’s “America Needs a National Identity Card” (op-ed, Jan. 21): We already have something like it and it’s called a “Passport Card.” It’s the size of a credit card and issued by the State Department. It verifies identity, nationality and place of birth, and can be used in lieu of a passport or a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license on U.S. domestic flights.<br />What America needs is the political will and an efficient bureaucratic infrastructure (please see Daniel Henninger’s same-day, same-page “Joe Biden’s Super State” Wonder Land column) to ensure that the card’s distribution is universally inclusive.<br />Let’s hope the template for its rollout isn’t the one used for the Covid vaccine.<br />Ira Sohn<br />New York"
