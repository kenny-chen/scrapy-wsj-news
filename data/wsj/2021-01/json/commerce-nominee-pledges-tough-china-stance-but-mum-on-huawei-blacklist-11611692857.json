    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s pick for Commerce secretary pledged a tough line against Chinese trade and technology threats, but stopped short of saying she would continue the Trump administration’s blacklisting of Huawei Technologies Co.<br />“We can’t have the Chinese or really anyone having a backdoor into our network and compromising in any way our national or economic security,” Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said at her Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday.<br />Referring specifically to Huawei, Ms. Raimondo said she would “use the full tool kit at my disposal…to protect Americans and our network from Chinese interference or any kind of backdoor influence into our network.”<br />But in response to questioning from Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), Ms. Raimondo stopped short of endorsing specific actions taken against Chinese tech companies by the former administration. She declined to promise to maintain the Commerce Department’s blacklisting of Huawei, pending a review.<br />That prompted Sen. Cruz to say he hopes the new administration won’t “go easy” on China, as he said some have speculated."
