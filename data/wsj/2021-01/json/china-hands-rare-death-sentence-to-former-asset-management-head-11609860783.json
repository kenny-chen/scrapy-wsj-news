    "body": "TAIPEI—China sentenced the former chairman of one of the country’s biggest state-owned asset-management companies to death on bribery and corruption charges, a striking signal in Beijing’s campaign to rein in financial risk-taking.<br />Lai Xiaomin, chairman of  China Huarong Asset Management Co.  from 2012 to 2018 when he was fired for graft, was accused by a local Chinese court in the northern city of Tianjin of taking bribes totaling a record high of more than 1.79 billion yuan, equivalent to $277 million.<br />Mr. Lai’s crimes were particularly serious, the court said Tuesday, given the scale of his bribery, which included several transactions in the hundreds of millions of yuan each as well as the act of proactively soliciting bribes. The court characterized him as being “lawless and extremely greedy,” with his actions “endangering the nation’s financial security and financial stability.”<br />Mr. Lai couldn’t be reached for comment.<br />By Chinese law, officials can face the death penalty, either by firing squad or lethal injection, for bribery totaling as little as three million yuan. Still, Chinese courts seldom resort to the death penalty for corruption, and accounts of financial bribery in China frequently total in the tens of millions of yuan."
