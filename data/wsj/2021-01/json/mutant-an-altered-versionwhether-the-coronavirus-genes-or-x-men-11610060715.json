Read previous columns here.<br />If you flipped on the morning talk shows last Sunday to hear Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious-disease expert, you’d be forgiven if you momentarily thought he was spinning a yarn from science fiction.<br />“We’ve isolated multiple examples of the mutant being in this country, so there’s no doubt it’s here,” Dr. Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” And on ABC’s “This Week,” he said, “That mutant is already here in the United States. It’s been well-reported.”<br />The “mutant” that Dr. Fauci was describing doesn’t come out of the pages of a comic book. Rather, it is the dangerous new strain of coronavirus that emerged in the U.K. and has rapidly spread to other countries. Many epidemiologists have observed that the latest mutation is a more contagious form, though it does not appear to make the resulting disease more severe.<br />The word “mutant,” much like a mutant virus strain, has evolved in unexpected directions over centuries of usage. It originated in Latin as “mutantem” meaning “changing,” from the verb “mutare.” That same root for “change” also spawned such words as “mutate,” “commute,” “transmute” and even “molt.”"
