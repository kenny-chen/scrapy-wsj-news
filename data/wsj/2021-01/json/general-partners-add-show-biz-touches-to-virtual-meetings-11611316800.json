    "body": "Platinum Equity partner Mark Barnhill took some time to adjust during the firm’s first online annual investor meeting in November.<br />“I was speaking into a laptop screen and didn’t have the normal faces in front of me offering both indirect feedback through body language, facial expression, nods or frowns and direct feedback through questions and comments online as the meeting unfolded,” Mr. Barnhill said.<br />His experience reflects some of the challenges faced by general partners changing their annual meeting formats to virtual last year as the coronavirus pandemic prompted travel and in-person meeting restrictions.<br />“Some investor meetings were a little clunky and disorganized because inherently that’s the case when people are dialing into Zoom from their home to participate.” said John Haggerty, managing principal and director of private-market investments at advisory firm Meketa Investment Group. “It’s never quite what you expect,” he said.<br />Adaptive, creative efforts helped most firms hold their annual investor meetings online. Some modified their virtual formats to improve the experience for participants, while only a handful canceled their meetings altogether, Mr. Haggerty said."
