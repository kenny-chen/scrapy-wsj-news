    "body": "AT&T Inc.  booked a $15.5 billion charge on its pay-TV business, reflecting the damage cord-cutting has taken on its DirecTV satellite unit even as the company’s HBO Max streaming service’s growth ramped up.<br />The write-down created a fourth-quarter loss as the media and telecom giant signaled it would move away from traditional channel bundles to focus on streaming media. The company reported quarterly revenue declines in its pay-TV and WarnerMedia units, offsetting gains in its core wireless phone division.<br />Overall, AT&T reported a fourth-quarter loss of $13.89 billion, or $1.95 a share, compared with a profit of $2.39 billion, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 2.4% to $45.7 billion.<br />The coronavirus pandemic has strained the giant, hurting advertising at cable networks like CNN and TBS and closing many of the theaters that show its Warner Bros. films. Those pullbacks obscured gains in the company’s wireless service, which still generates more than half of the company’s profits.<br />The last three months of the year gave AT&T a net gain of 800,000 postpaid phone subscribers, a metric closely watched by Wall Street. Rivals Verizon Communications Inc. and  T-Mobile US Inc.  reported net gains of 279,000 and 824,000 such connections, respectively."
