    "body": "In September and October, members of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s security detail got Covid-19 vaccines. But no shots had been approved for use in the country—then or now.<br />Lawmakers are trying to figure out how the vaccines were smuggled in.<br />The scandal emerged after Mr. Duterte said last month that several members of a military unit tasked with his personal protection had been vaccinated without his knowing. Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III, the unit’s commander, later said “a handful” of guards got the shots in September and October to protect the president from exposure to the virus.<br />Mr. Durante said the president learned of it only after the two required shots had been given, and that the unit acted without the help or approval of any other authority.<br />“We vaccinated ourselves,” he said in a televised interview. “It’s so easy.”"
