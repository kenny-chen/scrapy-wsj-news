    "body": "The U.S. economy’s 4% fourth-quarter increase wasn’t enough to ward off a full-year contraction from the pandemic’s initial shock, but growth is expected in 2021.<br />U.S. gross domestic product—the value of all goods and services produced across the economy—rose at a 4.0% seasonally and inflation adjusted annual rate in the final quarter of last year, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, joining a record gain in the third quarter to further reduce losses from earlier in the pandemic.<br />That left 2020 with a 3.5% annual contraction, measured year over year, and was the first decline since the financial crisis and the largest since 1946. Measured from the fourth quarter to the same quarter a year ago, the economy shrank 2.5%.<br />The coronavirus and related business disruptions put in place early in the pandemic upended the U.S. economy early last year, triggering business and school closures, a steep drop in demand for goods and services and record job losses. The economy rebounded in the second half of the year as it reopened, with sharp gains in employment and consumer spending over the summer that were helped by trillions of dollars in government aid.<br />While the recovery has slowed this winter, economists expect it will pick up again later in 2021, once the pandemic is under control, though the coronavirus remains a threat to the global economy."
