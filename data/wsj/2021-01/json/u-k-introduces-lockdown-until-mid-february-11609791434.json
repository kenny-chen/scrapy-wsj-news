    "body": "LONDON—British Prime Minister Boris Johnson began a national lockdown Monday, ordering the British population to stay home until mid-February amid spiraling infection rates caused by a new variant of the coronavirus.<br />As of Monday evening, schools and nonessential shops are to shut across England and people have been told to only leave their homes if necessary.<br />The imposition of a third national lockdown came after the government’s chief medical officers warned the more-contagious strain was spreading quickly across the country and that some hospitals risked being overwhelmed within three weeks if new restrictions weren’t put in place.<br />There are now more Covid-19 patients in British hospitals than at the height of the pandemic in the spring. Mr. Johnson said that the fight against the virus had reached a critical phase. “It is clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control,” he said.<br />The British government is engaged in a logistics race as it tries to vaccinate its population to slow the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable people. Britain moved more quickly than other European nations to approve and roll out Covid-19 vaccines. So far over a million people have received a Covid-19 vaccine shot in the U.K."
