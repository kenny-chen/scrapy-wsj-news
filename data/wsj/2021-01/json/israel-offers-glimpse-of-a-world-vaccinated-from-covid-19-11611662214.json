    "body": "PETAH TIKVAH, Israel—When residents and staff at an assisted-living facility received their first shots of  Pfizer Inc.’s  Covid-19 vaccine last month, they threw a spontaneous dance party and shook their hips, while remaining six feet apart from one another.<br />Now, all of the 110 elderly residents and 45 staff members at the Bayit Balev retirement home in a city east of Tel Aviv have received both shots of the vaccine, but the mood is less jubilant. As Israel remains under lockdown, and infections spread across the country, a return to normal still seems far off.<br />“We don’t know when it’s going to be over,” said 89-year old Elaine Aber, who has 23 grandchildren she hasn’t been able to hug in months. “That’s the feeling now.”<br />Israel’s citizens are at the forefront of the world’s most aggressive vaccination campaign. With more than 30% of its population having received the first dose of the vaccine and 14% having had the second, the country’s residents offer an early glimpse of what life might be like as vaccinations become the norm in society.<br />The answer: Not much different to now, public-health restrictions remain in place and new variants of the virus are on the loose."
