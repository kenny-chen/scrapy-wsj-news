    "body": "Kimberley A. Strassel’s “The Weekend Interview with William P. Barr” (Dec. 19) convinced me that the former attorney general is an honest and nice person. However, his major task was to investigate the attempted coup against the president. In the interview Mr. Barr criticizes the hesitant bureaucracy. He says, “Bring it to me! I’ll make the decision. That’s what I’m here for!” Then he goes on to explain why in almost two years he wasn’t able to get the job done. It was the pandemic. It was waiting for the inspector general’s report. Now, with Joe Biden poised to assume the presidency, we will never get the truth. Justice delayed is justice denied.<br />Lawrence P. Marlin<br />Bryan, Texas"
