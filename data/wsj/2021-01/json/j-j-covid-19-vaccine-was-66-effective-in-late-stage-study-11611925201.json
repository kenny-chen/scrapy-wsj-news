    "body": "Johnson & Johnson  said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine was 66% effective at protecting people from moderate to severe disease in a large clinical trial, positive results that could pave the way for its deployment across the U.S. within weeks.<br />The J&J vaccine also appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated among the 44,325 adults aged 18 years and older in the late-stage trial, J&J said Friday, though some of the volunteers reported side effects like fever.<br />The company, one of the world’s biggest health-care companies, said it would ask American regulators in early February to authorize use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could take action by the end of February.<br />If the shot gets a green light, J&J, which has been making shots to be ready should testing pan out, will be able to quickly ship millions of doses, federal officials have said. The company has said it expects to produce more than one billion doses in total this year.<br />Their addition could give a big lift to a mass vaccination campaign that has started slowly and faced limited supplies. J&J’s vaccine, which would be the third to be authorized in the U.S., would boost the overall stocks of Covid-19 shots for governments racing against a mutating virus to vaccinate residents."
