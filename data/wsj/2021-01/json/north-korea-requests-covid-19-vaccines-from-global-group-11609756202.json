    "body": "SEOUL—North Korea has submitted an application to receive Covid-19 virus vaccines from the main global alliance helping lower-income countries with inoculations, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />Gavi, the international vaccine alliance, declined to comment on North Korea’s application. But the group is assessing individual economies’ demands and expects to provide an update early in the year, a Gavi spokesman said.<br />In recent weeks, North Korea has reached out to several European embassies, inquiring how the country might obtain Covid-19 vaccines, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Gavi said last month that it had received detailed vaccine requests from 86 of 92 lower-income countries and economies eligible for the Covax Advance Market Commitment program, which is aiming for equitable distribution of vaccines. For that group, which includes North Korea, Covax has secured at least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses, targeting coverage of up to 20% of the population by the end of 2021.<br />North Korea hasn’t reported a single Covid-19 case. The Kim Jong Un regime has called combating the virus a matter of national survival. It has sealed off its borders and suspended foreign travel. Last week, state media warned of the new variant of the coronavirus, urging citizens to be on “maximum alert.”"
