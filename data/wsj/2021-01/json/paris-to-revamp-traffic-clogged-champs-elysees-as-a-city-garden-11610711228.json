    "body": "It might be the most famous avenue in the world, but the only time many Parisians visit the Champs-Élysées is when the French national soccer team wins the World Cup, waving flags or setting off flares.<br />Traffic-clogged and noisy, most leave it to tourists to shop in the high-end boutiques that line the 1.2-mile route running to the Arc de Triomphe.<br />But now Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has approved a makeover costing 250 million euros, equivalent to $303 million, that will turn the thoroughfare into what she called “an extraordinary garden,” with the first stage set to be completed before the Paris 2024 Olympics.<br />Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, city leaders around the world have given more thought to how people might live and work in the future. With more people working from home, some expect less traffic and more space for parks or pedestrianized spaces.<br />Campaigners in Paris, though, have been pressing for years to do something about the Champs-Élysées, named for the Elysian fields, the ancient Greeks’ idea of the afterlife. Some 72% of the estimated 100,000 pedestrians who visit the area each day are tourists, while 22% work there. Only 6% or less are Parisians."
