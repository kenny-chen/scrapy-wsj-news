    "body": "Investors betting on a continued economic rebound are increasingly looking beyond U.S. stocks.<br />Many money managers are focusing on emerging markets, which they expect to outperform as the global economy accelerates in the wake of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Some are also taking a look at European markets, which lagged behind in 2020 but are dominated by cyclical shares.<br />Investing in U.S. stocks, they say, has increasingly become a concentrated bet on the technology sector, which contributed more than half of the S&P 500’s 18% total return last year. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite fared even better, rising 45% including dividends. Those gains might be difficult to replicate in the new year.<br />“We feel like the opportunity from here going forward is really going to be in the international markets outside of the U.S.,” said Munish Malhotra, co-portfolio manager of global equity strategy at Cambiar Investors. Potential easing of Washington’s trade tensions with China could reduce a headwind, while in the U.S., big technology companies might face challenges trying to extend their rapid growth, he said.<br />Cambiar recently added to positions in the German engineering giant  Siemens AG  and the Macau casino operator  Sands China Ltd. , betting that both will benefit as the pandemic subsides."
