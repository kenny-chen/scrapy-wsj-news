    "body": "READING THE TEA LEAVES on possible major structural changes to Senate rules, statehood for the District of Columbia, and expanding the federal judiciary: Remarks by key Democratic senators in recent days lend oxygen to some progressive wish list items while likely dooming others.  Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told a Buffalo news outlet he was interested in expanding the number of federal district court judges, framing it as a local issue: “There’s a real shortage [of federal judges] in Western New York, and it is one of the things we’ll look at,” Schumer said.<br />Progressive activists would be thrilled, but some, including the group Take Back the Court, continue to press for an expansion of the conservative-majority Supreme Court. In a letter to Biden this week they warn that if his courts commission isn’t supportive of a major overhaul it will “help slam shut the window of opportunity before it is truly open.” Republicans and some Democrats oppose expanding the high court, partly because they believe it would set off a partisan race to keep expanding it further. Biden hasn’t taken a firm position on expanding the court but has called the court system “out of whack” and plans to convene a group of scholars to issue overhaul recommendations within 180 days.<br />Statehood for the District of Columbia and possibly Puerto Rico remains a live issue, though one possible Democratic opponent, Sen. Joe Manchin, said he “wants to see the pros and cons” of that issue. Adding the two states could result in four more Democratic senators. Forty-three Senate Democrats are on the record supporting D.C. statehood, and no other current Democratic senators have said they definitively oppose it.<br />Statehood would likely require eliminating the legislative filibuster, but Manchin and others who oppose that could support a rule change that only eliminated it for statehood votes, like previous rule changes that eliminated the 60-vote threshold for executive branch and judicial nominations.<br />2022 SENATE RACES have already begun, just days after the final contest of the 2020 cycle concluded in Georgia. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman announced a possible run last Friday, and within 72 hours said he had raised over $500,000. He is targeting the seat to be vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. GOP former Rep. Ryan Costello sharply criticized Fetterman’s record and said if he decided to run, he’d “smoke Fetterman in the suburbs.” But that would mean first winning a GOP primary, where Costello’s frequent criticisms of President Trump will test the soon-to-be-former president’s grip on the future of his party."
