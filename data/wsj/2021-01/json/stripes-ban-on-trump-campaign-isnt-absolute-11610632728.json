    "body": "Stripe Inc. has stopped processing payments for President Trump’s fundraising apparatus. Directly, that is.<br />The financial-technology company continues to process payments for intermediaries that route donations to Mr. Trump, after cutting off his campaign for violating its policies against encouraging violence.<br />Visitors to the Trump campaign website who click on a button to contribute are directed to a webpage hosted by WinRed, the small-dollar fundraising platform for Republican candidates and political-action committees. WinRed is a Stripe customer, and Stripe processes payments submitted over WinRed via that link, according to a review of its source code and people familiar with the matter.<br />The WinRed-hosted webpage tells visitors that donations go to the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee composed of the Trump campaign, Mr. Trump’s Save America political-action committee and the Republican National Committee.<br />A Stripe spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Mr. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment."
