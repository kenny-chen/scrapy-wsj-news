    "body": "YouTube suspended President Trump’s channel on Tuesday night, joining a growing list of tech companies that are ejecting him from their platforms.<br />The  Alphabet Inc.  video-sharing service said it was locking Mr. Trump’s channel for at least seven days after the company removed videos that it said violated its policies against content it believes could incite violence.<br />YouTube’s move follows similar decisions from  Facebook Inc.  and  Twitter Inc.  On Thursday, Facebook suspended Mr. Trump’s account indefinitely and on Friday, Twitter locked Mr. Trump’s personal account.<br />While the companies took action based on different pieces of content, the posts and videos appeared to reiterate unsubstantiated claims that the election was stolen and expressed support for the pro-Trump mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol last week.<br />Some users have praised the companies’ decisions as necessary to stop future violence. Others characterized the actions as infringing on free speech. Either way, the moderation decisions demonstrate the power a few Silicon Valley tech companies wield over online discourse."
