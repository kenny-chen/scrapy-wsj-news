    "body": "Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets forum briefly went dark late Wednesday, stunning users who had been flooding the community with posts all week amid a frenzied stock rally.<br />A message on the forum’s landing page initially said WallStreetBets had been taken private by its moderators because of technical difficulties on an “unprecedented scale as a result of the newfound interest in WSB.”<br />About an hour later, the forum was made available to the public again.<br />It wasn’t immediately clear why the forum was opened again. A post from one of WallStreetBets’ moderators noted the team had struggled to keep up with the influx of comments and posts submitted to the forum in recent days.<br />WallStreetBets has been the subject of growing fascination and scrutiny as once-unpopular stocks ranging from GameStop Corp. to  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  have drawn significant interest from individual investors, helping catapult their share prices to eye-popping highs. Much of the discussion surrounding these shares has originated on WallStreetBets and then was amplified across the internet."
