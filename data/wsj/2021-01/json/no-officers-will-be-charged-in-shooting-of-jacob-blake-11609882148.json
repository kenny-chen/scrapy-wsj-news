    "body": "KENOSHA, Wis.—The county prosecutor said he won’t bring charges against the police officer who last August shot Jacob Blake, sparking weeks of violent unrest in the small city south of Milwaukee.<br />Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley also that after conducting a thorough review of the incident he also wouldn’t charge Mr. Blake.<br />Mr. Graveley said that an independent expert who reviewed the case found that Officer Rusten Sheskey, who is white, had behaved reasonably in the Aug. 23 shooting that left Mr. Blake, a Black man wanted on a felony warrant, paralyzed from the waist down.<br />The key question, the prosecutor said, is whether Mr. Sheskey had a reasonable suspicion that he or someone else was in danger at the time the shots were fired.<br />“This has clearly been a tragedy for our community,” Mr. Graveley said, adding that he had to make his decision based on a review of the facts and not be swayed by the politics swirling around the case."
