    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Donald Trump’s Final Days” (Jan. 8): You write, “If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign.” An impeachment could never be resolved at trial within the remainder of his presidency.<br />You continue, “This would be the cleanest solution since it would immediately turn presidential duties over to Mr. Pence. And it would give Mr. Trump agency, a la Richard Nixon, over his own fate.” Of what high crime or misdemeanor has my president been accused: Of inciting a riot? How exactly? Of somehow failing to speak some magic formula to the mainstream press within a few moments after being informed of a chaotic crisis (which you exaggerate as an “assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election”)? But he hasn’t been shown to have initiated, condoned or sanctioned anything more than a peaceful demonstration. Why then is he supposed to admit culpability in this affair and resign in disgrace?<br />Tactically, it might be beneficial for him to hand the presidency to Vice President Mike Pence and accept a full pardon, a la Nixon. But to do so would destroy a movement that he nurtured and which is far from moribund, for his own personal convenience. Time will vindicate Donald Trump, but this editorial won’t be forgotten in this household long after Mr. Trump leaves office.<br />David deForrest<br />Jacksonville, Fla."
