    "body": "The number of chapter 11 business bankruptcies rose 29% last year even as plunging consumer bankruptcies kept overall U.S. filings at their lowest level since 1986.<br />More than 7,100 business entities filed chapter 11 petitions last year as the coronavirus pandemic and government-imposed lockdowns crimped revenues, according to legal-services provider Epiq Systems Inc.<br />Although individual filings were down substantially last year, consumer bankruptcies are typically a trailing economic indicator and are expected to rise significantly in the second half of 2021, said Epiq Senior Vice President Chris Kruse.<br />Judah Gross, director at Fitch Ratings, said he believes chapter 11 filings could continue to increase as troubled companies last year were able to avoid a bankruptcy filing thanks to the federal governmentâ€™s economic interventions.<br />Likewise, Mr. Gross said, individual filings might rise when mortgage forbearance programs and other coronavirus relief for consumers begin to expire."
