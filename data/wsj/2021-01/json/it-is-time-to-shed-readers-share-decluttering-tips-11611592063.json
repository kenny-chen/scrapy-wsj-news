I really identified with the idea of more had to go out than in. YES! Also, I loved identifying sensitive areas or items.<br />Our shelter in place order is still outstanding here. 2020 was a year of panic and planning on the verge of hoarding! Supplies and food stocked up. We geared up for the unknown. Yet, here we are in 2021, and the clutter has multiplied with closets bursting. The freezer is packed for an apocalypse. Can we relax? It is time to breathe a sigh of relief. Yes, we are not through the pandemic yet. However, we are OK. We have enough. Eat the food in the freezer. It is time to shed!<br />Madelyn Ripken Kolber\t\t\tLodi, Calif."
