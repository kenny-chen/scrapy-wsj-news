    "body": "The Justice Department won’t pursue charges against GOP Sen. Richard Burr after ending its investigation of stock trades he made in advance of the coronavirus market turmoil last year, the North Carolina lawmaker said.<br />“The Department of Justice informed me that it has concluded its review of my personal financial transactions conducted early last year,” Mr. Burr said Tuesday. “The case is now closed. I’m glad to hear it. My focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of North Carolina during this difficult time for our nation.”<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation began looking into reports in March that several members of Congress, their spouses or their investment advisers sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock after lawmakers attended closed-door briefings about the threat posed by the virus as it was beginning to reach the U.S. Some of those trades spared lawmakers as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses as stocks sank by mid-March.<br />Mr. Burr, who sat on two committees that received detailed briefings on the growing pandemic, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, which he had chaired, had sold shares of companies valued at as much as $1.7 million, which he owned with his wife. The sale saved the couple at least $250,000 in losses based on what those stocks were worth at the close of trading March 19, the Journal reported at the time.<br />Mr. Burr had said he made the trades based on news reports out of Asia rather than any inside information he had received, but he stepped down from his post as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee while the investigation continued."
