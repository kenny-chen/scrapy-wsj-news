    "body": "Demographic changes and the pandemic are propelling consumer-goods companies to take a fresh look at a group of shoppers who are often ignored: the elderly.<br />As people live longer and have fewer babies, the number of over-65s surpassed those under five globally for the first time in 2018, according to United Nations data, and the trend has accelerated since.<br />The pandemic has disproportionately harmed older people, which executives say has highlighted the importance of staying healthy later in life.<br />That shift is prompting companies like  Nestle SA,   Colgate-Palmolive Co.  and  Danone SA  to launch new products aimed at consumers they say are increasingly interested in aging well.<br />“We clearly see healthy aging, even more now with the Covid world, as a huge trend,” Danone Chief Executive Emmanuel Faber said."
