    "body": "“Walk On By,” written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach for singer Dionne Warwick in 1963, was unusual for its cool sophistication and lyrics from a woman’s perspective on a failed relationship. After the song was released in ’64, the single reached No. 6 on Billboard’s pop chart.<br />Recently, Mr. Bacharach, Ms. Warwick and studio pianist Artie Butler recalled the song’s evolution. Mr. Bacharach’s latest album, released in December, is a deluxe edition of “Blue Umbrella” (Big Yellow Dog), with co-writer and singer Daniel Tashian. Edited from interviews.<br />Burt Bacharach: In 1963, lyricist Hal David and I were focused on Dionne Warwick. We had signed her a year earlier to record our songs, and we were signed to Scepter Records.<br />Dionne had a singular voice that was perfect for us—young, earthy, edgy and confident. The first three singles we wrote for her—“Don’t Make Me Over” in ’62 and “This Empty Place” and “Make the Music Play” in early ’63—charted but weren’t big pop hits.<br />Hal and I began writing “Walk On By” in mid-’63 at our office in New York’s Brill Building. I sat at our terrible upright piano and Hal sat at a small desk with a pad and pen."
