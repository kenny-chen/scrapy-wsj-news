    "body": "The top federal prosecutor in Harrisburg, Pa., said his office will bring no criminal charges in an investigation into nine discarded mail-in ballots that had caught the attention of President Trump.<br />“After a thorough investigation conducted by the FBI and prosecutors from my office, we have determined that there is insufficient evidence to prove criminal intent on the part of the person who discarded the ballots,” Bruce D. Brandler, the acting U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, said in a statement Friday. “Therefore, no criminal charges will be filed and the matter is closed.”<br />The probe centered on nine ballots, which investigators said had been discarded and then recovered in Luzerne County in northeastern Pennsylvania. Of those nine ballots, seven were cast for Mr. Trump, the U.S. attorney’s office previously said.<br />In a statement issued in September, the county said that a temporary contractor had erroneously put some mail-in ballots in the office trash. The contractor was subsequently dismissed.<br />The Justice Department’s announcement about the opening of the inquiry in September drew controversy. At the time, election-law scholars and former law-enforcement officials criticized the department for publicizing it before its conclusion."
