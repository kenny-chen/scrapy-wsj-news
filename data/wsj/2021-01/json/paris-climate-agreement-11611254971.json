    "body": "In one of his first acts as president, Joe Bidenissued an executive order returning the U.S. to the Paris Climate Agreement. The U.S. had helped shape the accord under President Barack Obama but seven months after the pact took effect in late 2016, President Donald Trump withdrew the country.<br />The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international accord—though it is not a treaty—that was adopted at a United Nations climate conference in Paris in December 2015. It entered into force on Nov. 4, 2016, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified it.<br />The accord sets out a global framework to prevent dangerous climate change. It seeks to limit the rise in overall global temperature to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, with a target of no more than 1.5 degrees. Alongside this it aims to help countries financially in their efforts to tackle climate change and its impact.<br />Former President Donald Trump believed the accord put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage because of regulatory and financial burdens it would put on American companies. On announcing the U.S. departure in June 2017, he called the move a “reassertion of our sovereignty.”<br />Mr. Trump framed his decision mostly in economic and political terms, pointing to the agreement’s lesser requirements for the world’s other leading carbon emitters, China and India. He voiced concern for protecting the environment but he said his decision was rooted in protecting the country’s interests."
