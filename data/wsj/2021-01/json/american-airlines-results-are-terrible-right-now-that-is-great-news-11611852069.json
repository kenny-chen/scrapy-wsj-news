    "body": "Right now, there may be no greater gift for a company than dismal finances.<br />On Thursday, shares of  American Airlines  rose almost 30% at the open, reaching an 11-month high. American beat analysts’ profit expectations for the final quarter of 2020: Earnings per share came in at a negative $3.86, whereas the median forecast had them at $4.11.<br />But that doesn’t explain the pop. What does is that the numbers were still really bad in absolute terms—a $2.2 billion quarterly loss is one of the company’s worst results ever—justifying bearish Wall Street bets against it. In today’s topsy-turvy market, this all but guarantees stock gains.<br />Over the past week, swarms of individual investors, coordinating ithrough websites like Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, have taken on professional speculators, aggressively using options to unravel hedge funds’ preferred short bets. By squeezing the derivatives positions of banks, they have managed to engineer crazy rallies in the shares of troubled firms like  GameStop ,   BlackBerry ,   AMC  and  Nokia .<br />American Airlines was the perfect next target. It is the most-shorted major U.S. carrier, with 25% of its shares outstanding currently sold short in bets against it, according to FactSet data. Even better for Reddit-fuelled speculators, the company is disliked for very solid, objective reasons."
