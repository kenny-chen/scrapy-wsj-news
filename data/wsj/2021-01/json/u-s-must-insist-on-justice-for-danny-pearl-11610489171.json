    "body": "Gov. Chris Christie is right to raise the alarm over a Pakistani court decision to free one of Daniel Pearl’s convicted murderers (“Extradite Daniel Pearl’s Kidnapper,” Dec. 29). It is unconscionable that Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh may evade justice.<br />We understand the pain of Danny Pearl’s parents. Our daughter Malki, a vivacious American citizen in the 10th grade, was one of 15 murdered in the 2001 Jerusalem Sbarro pizzeria bombing spearheaded by Hamas terrorist Ahlam Tamimi. She confessed to all charges and an Israeli court sentenced her to 16 life terms. After Israel released her in an extortionate prisoner exchange, Tamimi returned to her native Jordan, where she was welcomed as a hero. The U.S. subsequently unveiled federal charges, named her an FBI Most Wanted Terrorist and requested her extradition from Jordan pursuant to a 1995 treaty. Jordan refuses.<br />We stand emphatically with the Pearls and pray public outrage will cause Pakistan to reverse course, ensuring Pearl’s killer remains behind bars or is sent for trial in the U.S. Parents must be spared the agony of manifest injustice on top of heart-breaking personal loss. By the same token, the U.S. should insist Jordan honor the 1995 treaty by extraditing our Malki’s killer to Washington.<br />Frimet and Arnold Roth<br />Jerusalem"
