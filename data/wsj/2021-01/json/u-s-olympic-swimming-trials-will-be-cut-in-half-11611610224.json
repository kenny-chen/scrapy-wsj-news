    "body": "With the fate of next summer’s Tokyo Olympics still teetering, USA Swimming is cutting its blockbuster Olympic trials in half, an attempt to make the event safer and more manageable for the pandemic era.<br />Trials organizers, in an effort to space out the athletes at CHI Health Center Arena in Omaha, Neb., no longer will host more than 1,700 swimmers at one giant eight-day event, as happened in 2016. Instead, they’ll stage two separate meets at the same Omaha arena in June.<br />Wave I will be a kind of wild-card meet for 550-650 lower-seeded swimmers on June 4-7. The top two finishers in each event will advance to the Wave II meet and compete against swimmers already qualified by their faster times.<br />Wave II, the main event, will include about 750 swimmers and take place June 13-20. The top 50 or so finishers in that meet, including swimmers who qualify in multiple events, will represent Team USA in Tokyo.<br />“We figured out this was the best option, and that it still allowed all athletes to have a crack at the Olympic trials, which, for many athletes is the pinnacle of their careers,” said Mike Unger, USA Swimming Chief Operating Officer. “But it also then allowed us to pick the best Olympic team.”"
