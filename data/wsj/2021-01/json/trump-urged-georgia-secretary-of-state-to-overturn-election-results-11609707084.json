    "body": "ATLANTA—President Trump in a Saturday telephone call urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the November election results that delivered the state to President-elect Joe Biden.<br />At one point in the roughly hourlong call, Mr. Trump told Mr. Raffensperger that he could face legal action and said he wanted him to find nearly 12,000 votes so he could reverse Mr. Biden’s victory.<br />“I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state,” he told Mr. Raffensperger on the call, adding later, “it’s not a problem that is going away.” Mr. Biden won the state by 11,779 votes.<br />A recording of the call was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Mr. Trump spent much of the call angrily and repeatedly alleging fraud in voting, ballot destruction, voting machine manipulation and other charges."
