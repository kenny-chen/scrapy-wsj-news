    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Trump’s latest executive order targeting Chinese tech platforms will fall to President-elect Joe Biden to enforce, or not, giving Mr. Biden a difficult political calculation to make in his first weeks in office.<br />The executive order issued late Tuesday bans U.S. transactions with eight Chinese-connected apps, including the Alipay mobile payment platform owned by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co., and the  WeChat  Pay app owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd.<br />But the order won’t take effect until next month—after Mr. Trump leaves office—meaning Mr. Biden has ample opportunity to modify or suspend it.<br />Already, the Biden transition team has announced that the incoming president will suspend and review late-stage executive actions by Mr. Trump that wouldn’t kick in until after he has left office.<br />The Biden transition team declined to comment Wednesday about whether the new executive order concerning Chinese apps would be among the Trump initiatives likely to be sidelined."
