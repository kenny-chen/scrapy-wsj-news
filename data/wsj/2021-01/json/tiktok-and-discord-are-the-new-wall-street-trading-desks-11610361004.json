    "body": "A new army of social media-enabled day traders is helping push stocks to records and turning companies into market sensations.<br />As trading by individual investors boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, so has the popularity of online communities where they gather. Platforms including TikTok,  Twitter ,  YouTube, Reddit, Instagram,  Facebook  and messaging platform Discord have become the new Wall Street trading desks. Individual investors gather to talk about hot stocks like  Tesla Inc.,  boast of gains and commiserate about losses.<br />These investors do more than just talk, though. They piggyback on each others’ ideas and trades, helping fuel the momentum that has propelled some companies to triple-digit or bigger gains in 2020.<br />“People fall in love with [some stocks] and they get in these echo chambers, where they are all shouting, like, ‘We’re going to buy Tesla forever!’” said Blake Bassett, a 31-year-old delivery driver who began trading several years ago. “People post all day like it’s a football game.”<br />And while online discussions among investors aren’t necessarily new—in the late 1990s internet chat rooms dedicated to stocks helped sustain the tech-stock bubble—social media is more widespread than ever before. That, meanwhile, has coincided with an industrywide move to commission-free trading, while most brokerages have made it easier to dabble in risky instruments like options."
