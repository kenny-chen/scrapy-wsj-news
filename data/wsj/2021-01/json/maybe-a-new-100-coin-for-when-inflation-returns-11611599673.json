    "body": "Regarding the letters “On the Increasing Irrelevance of U.S. Coins“ (Jan. 14): Our coins are worthless and should be in $1 and $2 denominations because the value of these coins would pay for coin things, like a Coke or candy bar. But may I also suggest a $5 coin? The Swiss franc is worth more than a U.S. dollar and the 5 franc coin is minted in a large size with actual heft, a coin one wants to carry and spend, and something Mr. Scrooge would gleefully stack. It feels like money.<br />But letter writer Peter V. Mini is mistaken. I have discussed our unique sales-tax mechanism with many citizens of the “civilized” high-VAT countries and all agreed that they would trade the convenience of VAT (or sales tax) inclusion in prices for a lower rate of less than 10%. Seeing the sales tax added at the end of each purchase is a regular reminder to the consumer of how much they pay and an incentive on tax raisers to keep rates low.<br />Colin Kuester<br />Bainbridge Island, Wash.<br />"
