    "body": "Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), a longtime figure in the Republican establishment, said he wouldn’t run for re-election in 2022, creating an open Senate seat in a competitive state.<br />Mr. Portman said in a statement that gridlock in Washington informed his decision to not seek re-election. The former White House budget chief was among a bipartisan group of senators involved in crafting the $900 billion Covid-19 relief bill that former President Donald Trump signed into law late last year.<br />“I don’t think any Senate office has been more successful in getting things done, but honestly, it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision,” he said.<br />Mr. Portman, 65 years old, is the second Republican from a competitive state to say he won’t run for re-election in 2022, when Republicans hope to take back control of the Senate. Sen. Pat Toomey, a spending hawk from Pennsylvania, also said he won’t run again.<br />The Senate is currently split 50-50, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaking vote."
