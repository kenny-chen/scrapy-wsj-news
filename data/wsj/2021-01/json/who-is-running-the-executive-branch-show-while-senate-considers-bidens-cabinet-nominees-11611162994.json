    "body": "President Biden took office on Wednesday with none of his cabinet agencies led by Senate-confirmed secretaries.<br />Anticipating delays in the Senate due to the unsettled control of the chamber heading into January and former President Donald Trump’s looming impeachment trial, the Biden transition team has named acting agency chiefs to lead the major government agencies until the Senate can act.<br />Federal law specifies that acting officials in cabinet-level positions must either be next in line for a position or hold a Senate-confirmed position. Another category of individuals who are eligible to serve as acting officials are those who have served as an “officer or employee” of the same agency for at least 90 days during the preceding year, at a senior-level pay scale.<br />Acting secretaries have the same powers as Senate-confirmed secretaries but are limited by law to serving 210 days. At the start of an administration, acting secretaries are allowed to serve an additional 90 days. And if there is a pending nomination, federal law permits an even longer term of service.<br />Nevertheless, organizations promoting good governance say it is critical to effective government to have Senate-confirmed nominees in place as soon as possible."
