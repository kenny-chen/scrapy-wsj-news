    "body": "Kevin Warsh writes that Beijing has pursued renminbi strength in recent years just as “fiscal and monetary support for its economy has become less expansionary”(“Beijing’s Bid for Financial Supremacy,” op-ed, Jan. 5). Credible money paired with reduced government spending have long been pillars of conservative rhetoric stateside, and with good reason. Per Mr. Warsh once again, these policies are consistent with “better, safer returns” for investors whose capital commitments drive all economic growth. Wealth isn’t taken from a fixed pie as some who fear China’s rise apparently assume; rather it’s created. It’s a reminder that Beijing’s efforts to lure investors aren’t a threat to the U.S. as much as they’re a positive incentive for the U.S. to similarly pursue better policies. What will make China rich will also lift the U.S. Growth is a choice.<br />John Tamney<br />Washington<br />If, as maintained by many, it is in our interest to be less intertwined with mainland China, then it would seem good for China to be holding less U.S. debt. Furthermore, if more of the world’s bondholders are drawn to debt issued by a government whose economic statistics are reputed to be less than accurate and who are propping up countless zombie firms and dubious real-estate developments, then step right up—have we got a deal for you.<br />Tom Paronis"
