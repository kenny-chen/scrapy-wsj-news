This week alone there are projects with Denzel Washington and Jared Leto (“The Little Things”) and Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan (“The Dig”). Spotify is also leaning on notable actors to voice audiobooks like Forest Whitaker, Hilary Swank and Cynthia Erivo.<br />Here’s how to stream them:<br />(HBO Max)<br />When John Lee Hancock wrote the script for “The Little Things” in the ‘90s, he envisioned it as a ‘70s movie—complicated characters, lots of questions and not as many answers. He had a deal with Warner Bros. and Steven Spielberg, but Mr. Spielberg ultimately passed on directing it. The story, about a sheriff’s deputy, a detective, and the search for a serial killer, was too dark for Mr. Spielberg to dive into right after “Schindler’s List,” he recalls.<br />Years later, after Mr. Hancock started directing films like “The Rookie” (2002), his producer on “The Little Things” encouraged him to direct the movie himself. But by then Mr. Hancock had young children at home and didn’t want to spend two years in the darkness, either."
