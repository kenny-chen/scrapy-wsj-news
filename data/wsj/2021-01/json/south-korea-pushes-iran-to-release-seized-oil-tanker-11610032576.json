    "body": "South Korea is mounting a diplomatic effort to free an oil tanker seized by Iran amid a dispute over frozen bank funds, the latest flare-up of tensions between Tehran and a U.S. ally.<br />A South Korean delegation arrived in Tehran on Thursday, three days after the 9,797-ton oil tanker Hankuk Chemi and its 20 crew members were detained. The delegation is expected to lay the groundwork for a visit to Iran on Sunday by the country’s vice foreign minister, according to the South Korean Foreign Ministry.<br />The tanker seizure coincides with rising international tensions between Iran and U.S. allies over the nation’s potential links to commercial shipping disruptions, progress toward a possible nuclear weapon and alleged cyberattacks.<br />Tehran said the ship flouted environmental regulations, but Seoul disputes the claim. The tanker’s most recent inspection during a 2019 port visit in China showed no environmental violations and just minor safety breaches, according to the European Union’s shipping database, Equasis.<br />Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said talks aren’t likely to begin before the South Korean vice foreign minister arrives, and called the detainment a technical issue that’s “being processed within its professional and judicial framework.”"
