    "body": "The San Antonio Spurs wore four different uniforms over the first month of the NBA season. Gregg Popovich wore the same number of mask styles.<br />The league’s oldest active coach has sported two colors of surgical masks, a fabric mask and one of the white KN95 masks that many experts now recommend. There is a similar variety of masks on the faces of every player and coach on the sideline. NBA teams playing through a pandemic are governed by hundreds of pages of health protocols, but they have more flexibility when it comes to one preventive measure: which masks they wear.<br />This is the latest way in which sports have become a microcosm of the U.S. Masks remain the most powerful weapon in fighting the spread of the coronavirus, with vaccinations still weeks or months away for the majority of people, while the most protective masks are no longer as scarce as they were in the early days of the pandemic.<br />But many Americans are still grabbing the most available or most comfortable masks as if they’re also the most effective. They’re not.<br />Now some doctors, scientists and health officials believe it’s no longer enough to tell people to wear masks. It’s time to tell them to start wearing better masks—or wearing two masks."
