    "body": "The House prepared to cast a series of votes aimed at ousting or impeaching President Trump over his role in last week’s violence at the U.S. Capitol, while Republicans wrestled with how to respond to the president, who continued to deny any wrongdoing.<br />The first test of GOP sentiment will come Tuesday night, when a handful of Republicans who have said Mr. Trump is no longer fit to serve could join Democrats in supporting a resolution demanding that Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office. If Mr. Pence doesn’t act, Democrats have said they would move forward with an impeachment vote Wednesday, and would have enough votes even without GOP support.<br />Mr. Trump, in his first comments to reporters in several days, criticized Democrats for seeking to impeach him, calling it a “continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics” and said the move was “causing tremendous anger.”<br />He also called for “no violence,” as concerns mount about the possibility of more violent protests around Inauguration Day.<br />The president defended himself against criticism that his efforts to rile up his supporters about baseless claims of election fraud led to last week’s riot. “They’ve analyzed my speech…my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody just thought it was totally appropriate,” he said."
