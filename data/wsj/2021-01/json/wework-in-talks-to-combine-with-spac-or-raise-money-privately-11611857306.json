    "body": "WeWork is in talks to combine with a special-purpose acquisition company, according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that would usher the office-leasing company into the public markets more than a year after its high-profile failure to stage a traditional initial public offering.<br />WeWork’s board and its Chief Executive Sandeep Mathrani have been weighing offers from a SPAC affiliated with Bow Capital Management LLC and at least one other unidentified acquisition vehicle for several weeks, the people said. A deal could value WeWork at some $10 billion, some of the people said. It couldn’t be learned whether that includes debt.<br />The company also has received separate offers for a new private investment round, and it may well take that route instead, one of the people said. If it were to do so, WeWork would stay private and use the money to support its growth initiatives.<br />The talks are complicated and there is no guarantee WeWork will end up striking any dealsoon, the people cautioned.<br />“Over the past year, WeWork has remained focused on executing our plans for achieving profitability,” Lauren Fritts, WeWork’s chief communication officer, said. “Our significant progress combined with the increased market demand for flexible space, shows positive signs for our business. We will continue to explore opportunities that help us move closer towards our goals.”"
