    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) declined to say Friday when Democrats would initiate the trial in President Trump’s second impeachment, leaving Congress’s agenda for the start of the Biden administration up in the air.<br />After the House impeached Mr. Trump earlier this week, Mrs. Pelosi now needs to decide when to formally send the article of impeachment to the Senate, which would kick off a trial in that chamber. Democrats are still figuring out how to proceed without derailing the start of President-elect Joe Biden’s term, with cabinet nominees and a Covid-19 aid package also requiring the Senate’s attention.<br />“You’ll be the first to know when we announce we’re going over there,” Mrs. Pelosi told reporters.<br />A guilty verdict in the eventual trial wouldn’t remove Mr. Trump from office, as he would already be gone. But Democrats want to send a message, and senators angered by his actions could also vote to bar him from holding office in the future.<br />“Donald Trump remains a threat to our democracy and will be held accountable for what he’s done—whether or not he’s president during trial,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.)."
