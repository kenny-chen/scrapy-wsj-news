    "body": "Mark E. Kingdon’s comments in “New York, I Love You, but We Can’t Go On Like This” (Cross Country, Jan. 16) should be heeded because they are sound and touch every citizen, young or old, white or black. The state and city have done all that they can to drive away entrepreneurs, business owners and the wealthy. No city in the world can long survive without those vital citizens.<br />The real problem is New York politics and the lack of a viable Republican presence to compete for power. With no opposition to challenge them, New York Democrats at all levels run rampant in creating an environment where only their ideas are implemented. That leads to ridiculous budget imbalances and king-making. New York doesn’t need kings, it needs good policies and, especially, good schools. When I was a kid in Brooklyn, city schools were among the best anywhere. No longer.<br />The travails of the city, including crime and high taxes, may ultimately drive Mr. Kingdon to leave for sunny climes, as have dozens of other Wall Streeters. Despite wanting to remain, the costs are simply too tough and the crime too threatening to remain. I know. I left the city 30 years ago.<br />Richard Klitzberg<br />Boca Raton, Fla."
