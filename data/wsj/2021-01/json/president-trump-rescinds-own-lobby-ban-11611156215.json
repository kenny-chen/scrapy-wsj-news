    "body": "WASHINGTON—In one of his final acts in office, President Trump on Wednesday rescinded rules he created four years ago that he said at the time would make his government one of the most ethical in U.S. history.<br />About an hour after midnight, Mr. Trump struck down his 2017 executive order that had blocked administration officials from taking lobbying jobs for five years after leaving office.<br />That 2017 executive order went further than many prior presidents in restricting the kinds of jobs White House and other administration officials could take after leaving the government.<br />Mr. Trump’s goal at the time was to take aim at one of the institutional problems with Washington by ending the so-called revolving door between government and corporate lobbying.<br />The 2017 order banned anyone Mr. Trump hired to work in the White House, U.S. departments or other federal agencies from leaving the government and becoming a lobbyist for five years. Mr. Trump also precluded former Trump administration officials from ever working on behalf of foreign governments or political parties."
