No trade barriers or tariffs.<br />Jan.1 and after: No tariffs or quantitative limits on imports or exports, but a host of new border formalities because the U.K. is out of the EU single market and its customs union.<br />Before Dec. 31: No customs paperwork and minimal border checks for products crossing in either direction.<br />Jan.1 and after: Costly new customs, safety, value-added tax and other declarations. New checks on food and animal imports to the EU, and some increased controls on goods heading from the U.K. mainland to Northern Ireland.<br />Before Dec. 31: Full access to both ways for EU and U.K. citizens for vacations and business travelers (and their pets) with automatic health insurance and access to fast-track lanes at airports.
