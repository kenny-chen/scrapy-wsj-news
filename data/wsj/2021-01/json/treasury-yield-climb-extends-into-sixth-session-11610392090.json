    "body": "U.S. government bond yields rose Monday despite a decline in stocks, marking their sixth-consecutive session of gains after logging the biggest one-week increase since June.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which rises when bond prices fall, finished Monday’s trading session at 1.131%, according to Tradeweb. That is up from 1.105% at Friday’s close.<br />The climb extended even as U.S. stock indexes fell, a break from the usual relationship between stocks and bonds. Investors tend to buy government bonds when they are worried about the economy and don’t want to hold riskier assets like stocks.<br />Driving yields higher in recent sessions: increased investor expectations for new stimulus measures later this year after Democrats won control of the Senate during last week’s runoff elections.<br />The 10-year yield rose above 1% for the first time since March after last week’s election results, marking a notable recovery from record lows reached early in the pandemic, when stocks plunged and investors fled to the safety of government bonds."
