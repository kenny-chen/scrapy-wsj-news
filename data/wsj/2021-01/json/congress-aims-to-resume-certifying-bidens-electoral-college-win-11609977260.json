    "body": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said she planned to resume Wednesday night the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory as soon as it was safe to do so, after the proceedings were halted in the afternoon by a mob storming the U.S. Capitol.<br />“Today, a shameful assault was made on our democracy,” Mrs. Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Democrats. “It cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden.” Mrs. Pelosi said she had discussed the decision to resume the proceedings with officials at the Pentagon, Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence, as well as other senior Democrats.<br />Lawmakers in both chambers had said they hoped to meet as soon as possible to finish ratifying Mr. Biden’s 306-232 electoral win. They were in the early stages Wednesday afternoon when rioters disputing Mr. Biden’s victory over President Trump overtook the Capitol, forcing lawmakers and aides to seek shelter.<br />“We always knew this responsibility would take us into the night. The night may still be long but we are hopeful for a shorter agenda, but our purpose will be accomplished,” Mrs. Pelosi wrote.<br />Many lawmakers had been eager to resume the certification of the vote, saying they didn’t want to let the mob prevent them from fulfilling their constitutional role."
