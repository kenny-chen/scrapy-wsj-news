    "body": "WASHINGTON—When South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice cast his vote Wednesday to impeach President Trump, some GOP aides believed the conservative Republican had made an absent-minded mistake.<br />He had not.<br />Mr. Rice woke up Wednesday morning with his mind decided. He didn’t tell GOP leaders how he planned to vote or issue a statement beforehand. One week after he had been on the House floor when a violent mob stormed the Capitol, he voted to impeach, joining nine other House Republicans to side with Democrats in the 232-197 tally.<br />“I spent the last couple of days looking at what happened that day and what the president was doing while it was happening,” Mr. Rice said in an interview Thursday. “And the more I looked at it, the madder I got.”<br />Widely seen as the most surprising of the GOP votes to impeach Mr. Trump, Mr. Rice represents a safely Republican district in South Carolina that includes Myrtle Beach, and he has rarely broken with the party or the president. Now, Mr. Rice faces political blowback at home, but he says he felt compelled to vote against Mr. Trump."
