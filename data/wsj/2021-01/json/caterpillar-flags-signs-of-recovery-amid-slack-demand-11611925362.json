    "body": "A construction slowdown during the coronavirus pandemic is hurting demand for  Caterpillar Inc.’s  heavy machinery, but the manufacturer said dealers and customers expect a turnaround this year.<br />The Deerfield, Ill., company said Friday that revenue fell 15% in its fourth quarter due to lower volumes and less demand from customers and dealers. Revenue declined in each of Caterpillar’s main businesses: construction, mining, and energy and transportation.<br />Andrew Bonfield, Caterpillar’s financial chief, said in an interview that while a rebound in home construction was boosting purchases for some machinery, spending cuts by local and state governments were weighing on road construction.<br />“People in an uncertain time are just not necessarily sanctioning new projects,” Mr. Bonfield said.<br />Still, Caterpillar said it sees signs of a turnaround. Its order backlog increased in its fourth quarter compared with the previous three months and a year earlier as dealers ordered new machines ahead of the traditionally busy spring season. For the current first quarter Caterpillar said it expects stronger sales of construction equipment in particular."
