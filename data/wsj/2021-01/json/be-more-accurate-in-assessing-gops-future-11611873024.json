    "body": "In “The GOP Hit Rock Bottom. Can Conservatives Recover?” (op-ed, Jan. 22), Garry Kasparov advises the Republican Party to stop the rise of the far right. No doubt about it, it’s good advice.<br />But just how large is the far right in the Republican Party or among conservatives? Are there any reliable numbers? As far as I can see, the numbers are small. They are made to look huge by the media and the Democrats. My friends who are Democrats seem to think that most people who are conservatives are on the far right. I think this is nonsense. Some, to be sure. But not huge numbers.<br />Gandolfo Corradino<br />Annandale, Va.<br />"
