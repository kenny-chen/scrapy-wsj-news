    "body": "WASHINGTON—Expectations for an economic recovery and continued government aid are fueling overconfidence among investors, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday, raising the risk of a sudden drop in asset prices that could threaten financial stability.<br />“With investors betting on persistent policy backstop, a sense of complacency appears to be permeating markets,” Tobias Adrian, head of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, and his deputy, Fabio Natalucci, wrote in a blog post. “Coupled with apparent uniform investor views, this raises the risk of a market correction or repricing.”<br />Even so, governments should continue to provide fiscal and monetary support until a sustainable recovery takes hold, they said. “Reducing or withdrawing support at this stage could jeopardize the global economic recovery.”<br />The blog post accompanied an update to the fund’s semiannual Global Financial Stability Report released on Wednesday.<br />Delays in vaccinations, especially in emerging market economies that account for about 65% of global growth, could lead to a tightening in financial conditions and a rise in financial vulnerabilities that have been held in check so far, they said. Those include rising corporate and government debt levels and declining profitability in some banking systems."
