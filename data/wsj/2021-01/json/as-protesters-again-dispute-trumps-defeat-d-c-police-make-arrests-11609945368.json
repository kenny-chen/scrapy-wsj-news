    "body": "WASHINGTON—Protesters breached the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon as both the House and Senate were meeting inside after President Trump urged demonstrators to march there and pressure Congress to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s win.<br />Hundreds of people protesting Mr. Trump’s loss in the November election could be seen walking through the building’s famous Statuary Hall after pushing aside barricades and shoving police out of the way, waving Trump and American flags and cheering from the balconies of the Capitol building. Thousands of protesters surrounded the Capitol on all sides, and some climbed up the outside walls.<br />The police presence appeared to be minimal, though there were some police in riot gear on the east side of the Capitol by the Senate entrance.<br />Protesters chanted “Take the building!” and “Stop the steal!”—a popular refrain as Mr. Trump’s supporters challenged the results of  the November presidential election.<br />The protest took place as Congress was set to ratify President-elect Biden’s Electoral College win."
