    "body": "Walgreens  Boots Alliance Inc. is set to name Starbucks Corp. operating chief Roz Brewer as its next chief executive, according to people familiar with the matter, setting her up to be the only Black female leading a Fortune 500 company today.<br />Ms. Brewer will replace Stefano Pessina, who said in July that he would step down as CEO once the drugstore company found a new leader. Mr. Pessina, one of Walgreens’ biggest individual investors, said he was planning to stay on the company’s board and serve as executive chairman.<br />Shares of Walgreens, which has a market value of around $43 billion, rose 7.4% after hours after The Wall Street Journal reported on the move.<br />Starbucks said Tuesday that Ms. Brewer was leaving at the end of February for a new role at another public company. Before joining the coffeehouse chain, Ms. Brewer was CEO of  Walmart  Inc.’s  Sam’s Club division for five years.<br />Ms. Brewer, 58 years old, has been operating chief and a member of the board at Starbucks since 2017. She helped shift Starbucks toward a focus on to-go operations during the pandemic and has worked to diversify the company’s leadership. Starbucks last fall said it would tie executive compensation to increasing minority representation in its workforce, and mandated antibias training for company leaders."
