    "body": "Meghan Cox Gurdon’s op-ed “Even Homer Gets Mobbed” (Dec. 28) describes how some educators are using the ubiquitous terms “racism” and “sexism” to attack classic literature. What a disservice to children to deny them access to the greatest thinking of all time.<br />Ron Cope<br />Chicago<br /><br />Dealing with his family’s shame from involvement in the Salem witch trials, Nathaniel Hawthorne tried in “The Scarlet Letter” to expose the roots of fanaticism. Mark Twain did something similar in “Huckleberry Finn,” exposing the world of slavery and ignorance that he grew up in. The #DisruptTexts minions may want to ban these great novels, but you can be sure they don’t understand them."
