Col Allan, a former editor in chief of the Post who has served as a senior adviser since 2019, will retire in early March. A spokesman for News Corp said Mr. Poole’s role is a new position.<br />“I’ve always admired the bold and brash journalism of the New York Post, and to now be a part of this legendary organization is a dream come true for a journalist like me,” Mr. Poole said in a statement.<br />One person familiar with the promotion said Mr. Poole has a strong digital background. Before being elevated to his role at the Sun in February 2020, Mr. Poole was the organization’s digital editor. He worked earlier in his career at the Daily Mail, another U.K. publication, including a stint as managing editor of the MailOnline in New York.<br />Two senior editors at the Post will remain in place. Stephen Lynch, editor in chief of the print edition, and Michelle Gotthelf, editor in chief of the digital edition, will report to Mr. Poole."
