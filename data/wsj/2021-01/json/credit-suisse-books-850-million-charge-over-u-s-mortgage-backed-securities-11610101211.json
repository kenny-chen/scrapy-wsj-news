    "body": "An $850 million legal charge will push  Credit Suisse  Group AG into a net loss in the fourth quarter, denting what had been a strong performance by the Swiss banking giant last year.<br />Credit Suisse added the litigation provisions related to residential mortgage-backed securities following a review it started in December. It said last month it might have to pay $680 million in a New York civil case over a security it marketed more than a decade ago, although it plans to appeal and said it had set aside $300 million for that legal action.<br />The new charges reflect the potential bill for that case, and for other legal action over similar securities issued before the 2008 financial crisis that proved toxic for investors.<br />The provisions add to a $450 million fourth-quarter charge announced by the bank in November to reflect changes at U.S. asset manager York Capital Management, in which it holds a 30% stake.<br />Shares in Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank by assets under management, fell more than 3% in European trading Friday."
