    "body": "DALTON, Ga.—Rallying voters in Georgia on the eve of Tuesday’s Senate runoff elections, President Trump delivered a political message to an entirely different audience: his vice president.<br />“I hope that Mike Pence comes through for us,” Mr. Trump said to cheers. “He’s a great guy. Of course if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much.”<br />The pressure play Monday night came two days before Mr. Pence is set to take on perhaps his most politically challenging task in four years as a loyal second-in-command. On Wednesday he will oversee a joint session of Congress that is expected to ratify Democrat President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, even as Mr. Trump continues to reject the results and some Capitol Hill allies plan to contest some state results.<br />On Tuesday, Mr. Trump added further pressure by tweeting, “The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.”<br />The states have already certified their results from their electors, and the vice president doesn’t have the power to alter them."
