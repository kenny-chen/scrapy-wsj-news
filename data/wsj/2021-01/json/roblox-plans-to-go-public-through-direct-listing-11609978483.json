    "body": "A month after shelving its plans to go public, videogame company Roblox Corp. said it raised $520 million and that it is planning a direct listing.<br />A direct listing allows companies to float their shares directly on the stock market, rather than going through the underwriting process typically associated with taking a company public. Data-mining firm  Palantir Technologies Inc.,  streaming service  Spotify Technology SA  and workplace messaging platform  Slack Technologies Inc.  went public via direct listings.<br />A Series H funding round led by Altimeter Capital and Dragoneer Investment Group placed the company’s shares at $45 apiece, bringing its valuation to a total of $29.5 billion. The company was valued at $4 billion following a $150 million raise in February 2020.<br />The Investment Group of Santa Barbara and Warner Music Group also participated in the funding round, as did several of its existing investors.<br />The company said the proceeds will go toward Roblox’s growth initiatives and platform that will enable shared experiences among its billions of users."
