    "body": "WILMINGTON, Del.—President-elect Joe Biden forcefully denounced the storming of the U.S. Capitol by pro-Trump rioters, calling it an unprecedented assault on the nation’s democracy that “borders on sedition.”<br />He urged President Trump to publicly “demand an end to this siege.”<br />“It’s not protest,” Mr. Biden said. “It’s insurrection.”<br />Mr. Biden, who spent more than three decades in the Senate, addressed the nation two weeks before his inauguration.<br />Mr. Trump released a video statement around the time Mr. Biden was making his remarks, telling supporters at the U.S. Capitol to leave and that he felt their pain over the election. He also continued to make baseless claims of a fraudulent election. “So go home,” he said. “We love you. You’re very special.”"
