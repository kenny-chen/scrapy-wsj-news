    "body": "People booking vacation rentals in New York on sites like  Airbnb Inc.  could soon start paying sales taxes that home-sharing companies would collect under a proposal included in Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s $193 billion budget.<br />Aides to the Democratic governor say the proposal could generate an additional $10 million for the state in the fiscal year that starts April 1, and $18 million in subsequent years. Roughly the same amount of money would also flow to local governments around the state, which also levy their own surcharges on top of the state’s 4% sales tax.<br />The proposal was embraced by the group representing the state’s county governments, but it could revive a broader debate about how home-sharing companies are regulated in the state, lawmakers said, which is fueled by different concerns in different parts of the state.<br />“I think it’s now opportune for us to have this larger conversation,” said state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat from Orange County, who favors changing state law to allow for short-term rentals in multifamily buildings.<br />Mr. Cuomo’s proposal doesn’t address registration or change the state’s multiple-dwelling law, which prevents someone from renting an apartment in a building with three or more units for fewer than 30 days unless the apartment’s tenant is also present."
