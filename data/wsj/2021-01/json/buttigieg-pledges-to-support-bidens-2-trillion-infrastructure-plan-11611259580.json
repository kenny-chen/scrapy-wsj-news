    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg pledged Thursday his support for President Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure-rebuilding plan during a confirmation hearing before a Senate panel.<br />The $2 trillion target is tied to Mr. Biden’s goal to use climate change as a wedge for economic development, focused on rebuilding roads and bridges and expanding zero-emission mass transit and electric-car infrastructure. In all, the administration seeks to spend $7 trillion over a decade to combat climate change, his campaign and third-party experts have said.<br />Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Biden’s nominee to lead the Transportation Department, told the Senate Commerce Committee that he would pursue the administration’s goals to drive federal spending on roads, rails and bridges.<br />“This is our opportunity to literally do the building part in ‘Build Back Better,’” Mr. Buttigieg said, alluding to Mr. Biden’s campaign slogan.<br />Republicans, now in the Congressional minority, have begun to express skepticism about federal spending after four years of relatively robust highway spending packages under the Trump administration."
