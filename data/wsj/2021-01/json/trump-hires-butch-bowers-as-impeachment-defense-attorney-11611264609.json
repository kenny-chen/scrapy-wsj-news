    "body": "Former President Donald Trump told associates he has picked Butch Bowers, a South Carolina attorney, to represent him in his Senate impeachment trial, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />The move was finalized on Wednesday, Mr. Trump’s last day in office, the person said. Several of the lawyers who represented Mr. Trump in his first impeachment trial—including former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow—had told associates they didn’t plan to defend Mr. Trump a second time, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The House voted last week to impeach Mr. Trump, alleging he incited a mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as part of his effort to overturn his election loss to President Joe Biden. It isn’t yet known when the Senate trial will begin.<br />Mr. Bowers served as a special counsel for voting matters in the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush. He also served as chairman of the South Carolina State Election Commission and as counsel to former Govs. Mark Sanford and Nikki Haley.<br />Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), who will be one of the jurors in Mr. Trump’s trial, recommended Mr. Bowers to the former president, the person said. Mr. Graham didn’t respond to a request for comment."
