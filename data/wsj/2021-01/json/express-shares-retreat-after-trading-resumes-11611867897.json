With trading resumed, Express shares dropped to $4.64 Thursday afternoon from a high of $13.97 a share on Wednesday. The shares had closed on Tuesday at just over $3.<br />Express, like many bricks-and-mortar retailers, especially ones selling clothes for office wear, has struggled since the coronavirus pandemic started and risked running out of cash.<br />The Columbus, Ohio-based retailer hired Lazard Freres & Co. to help search for financing to outlast the pandemic, Chief Executive Timothy Baxter said in December.<br />Earlier this month, Express obtained a $140 million loan facility from private-equity firm Sycamore Partners, Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and  Bank of America .  Express shares closed at $1.28 a share the day the company announced the financing."
