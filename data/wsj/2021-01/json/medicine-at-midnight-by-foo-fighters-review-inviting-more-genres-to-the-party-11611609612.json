    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />Dave Grohl’s long-running band Foo Fighters is defined by its consistency. Launched as a solo project in 1995 when Mr. Grohl was still shaken by the death of Kurt Cobain, his bandmate in Nirvana, Foo Fighters turned into a reliable outfit that, across nine studio albums, has never veered far from the post-grunge alternative template. By 1997’s “The Colour and the Shape,” Mr. Grohl had recruited members and Foo Fighters has been a full-fledged band since, one with two primary modes—dynamic hard rock, where brooding verses lead to anthemic choruses driven by power chords, and hushed ballads, where acoustic arrangements provide contrast. Unlike some of their ’90s peers, Foo Fighters has never embarrassed itself—there have been no ill-advised genre exercises à la Weezer, no indulgent multi-disc concept albums à la the Smashing Pumpkins. But Foo Fighters has never transcended down-the-middle rock, either. The group experiments within clearly defined parameters, which is both a strength and a weakness."
