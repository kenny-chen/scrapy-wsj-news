    "body": "Organizers for President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration and federal officials are boosting security in response to growing concerns after last week’s attack on the Capitol by a mob of supporters of President Trump.<br />The entities organizing the inauguration—the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the Presidential Inauguration Committee—are sticking by their plan to hold Mr. Biden’s swearing-in ceremony on the west front of the Capitol. He will also deliver his inaugural address there.<br />Both committees have had ongoing discussions in recent days about security protocols, according to people familiar with the talks. The congressional committee, which includes House and Senate leadership, convened a meeting on Monday to discuss efforts to bolster security.<br />A House Democratic aide familiar with the discussions said that, in response to last week’s deadly violence, construction efforts are now under way to erect “the largest perimeter ever established around the Capitol” for Mr. Biden’s inauguration. The new perimeter will add another layer to the secure areas typically in place for inaugural ceremonies at the Capitol.<br />Those talks came as federal officials decided to begin coordinating security steps sooner than they had planned and the National Guard announced it would bolster its presence in Washington ahead of the inauguration."
