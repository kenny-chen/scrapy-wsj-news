    "body": "WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden’s pick to lead the nation’s sprawling intelligence community is scheduled to face a confirmation hearing in the Senate Intelligence Committee, kicking off the process of putting in place the new administration’s cabinet as several nominees face lawmakers Tuesday.<br />Avril Haines, who was the Central Intelligence Agency’s deputy director and deputy national security adviser under President Obama, will be the first of Mr. Biden’s cabinet nominees to have a confirmation hearing.<br />If confirmed, Ms. Haines would be the first woman to oversee the country’s intelligence community, which encompasses 18 other agencies, including the CIA and the National Security Agency, and employs hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors.<br />Mr. Biden announced his selections of Ms. Haines in November, and last week nominated William J. Burns, a former career diplomat, to run the CIA.<br />By announcing Ms. Haines among his first batch of nominees, Mr. Biden has signaled that he intends to empower the director of national intelligence and make Ms. Haines its clear leader, former intelligence officials have said. Congress created the position of director of national intelligence after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to ensure intelligence agencies coordinated their efforts."
