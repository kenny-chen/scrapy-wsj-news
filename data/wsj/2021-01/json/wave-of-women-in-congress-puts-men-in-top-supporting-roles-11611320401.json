    "body": "WASHINGTON—Another glass ceiling of sorts was shattered in Washington this week—beyond the first female vice president.<br />This particular ceiling was shattered by a man, when Charlie Capito debuted Thursday as the first male president of the Congressional Club, a bipartisan group of current and former spouses of lawmakers and other high-ranking officials founded in 1908.<br />Mr. Capito, the husband of Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.), begins his two-year term at a time when men are playing higher-profile supporting roles in U.S. politics, as more women enter Congress and the highest levels of elected office.<br />For spouses, figuring out how to incorporate the demands of Congress into their family lives is an area where the club tries to provide support, Mr. Capito said. “The club does provide a forum for members because not everybody’s life is the same, but they sure do rhyme,” he said.<br />Mr. Capito’s ascension coincides with the arrival of more GOP husbands than ever before, trailing a tidal wave of Democratic women elected two years ago. A record-breaking 31 House Republican women, including two delegates, were sworn in this year. Eight GOP women are now serving in the Senate this year, following the departure of Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R., Ga.), who lost a runoff this month."
