    "body": "WASHINGTON—A group of Republican senators are zeroing in on three states as they hone their plans to object to the Electoral College vote count, pushed by President Trump to overturn the election of Democrat Joe Biden.<br />Lawmakers are set to meet in a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to certify Mr. Biden’s 306-232 electoral vote win. Both a House lawmaker and a senator need to object in writing to trigger debates and votes in both chambers on whether to disqualify a state’s electoral votes.<br />The senators’ objections are aimed at results in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania. None of the challenges are expected to succeed in the Democratic-controlled House or the GOP-run Senate, where party leaders have opposed the effort and a growing number of Republicans say they won’t join in.<br />Vice President Mike Pence is set to preside over the joint session, which will count the states in alphabetical order. While Mr. Pence’s role as president of the Senate is largely ceremonial, Mr. Trump has demanded that he intervene in the process.<br />Mr. Trump has claimed he lost the election due to widespread voter fraud, but he and his supporters have failed to present evidence that would change the outcome and have been rebuked in dozens of legal rulings. The challenge in Congress marks a last-ditch effort just two weeks from Inauguration Day."
