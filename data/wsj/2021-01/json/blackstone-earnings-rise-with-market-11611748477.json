    "body": "Blackstone Group Inc.  reported higher earnings for the fourth quarter as the value of its private-equity portfolio climbed with the broader market.<br />The buyout giant posted net income of $748.9 million, or $1.07 a share, for the quarter. That compares with a profit of $483.1 million, or 71 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2019, it said Wednesday.<br />The value of Blackstone’s private-equity portfolio climbed by 10.6% in the latest period as the S&P 500 rose 11.7%.<br />Blackstone’s investment portfolio has been buoyed in recent quarters by its exposure to areas of the economy that have fared relatively well during the coronavirus pandemic, including logistics, enterprise software, digital payments and life sciences.<br />The firm sees opportunity in sectors that have been temporarily beaten down by the virus, but which should recover quickly once vaccines have been widely administered, such as location-based entertainment and transportation infrastructure, Blackstone President Jonathan Gray said in an interview."
