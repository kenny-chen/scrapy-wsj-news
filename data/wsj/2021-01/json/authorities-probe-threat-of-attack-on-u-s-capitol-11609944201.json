    "body": "Aviation, law-enforcement and national-security officials are investigating an unauthorized message sent on an air-traffic control channel threatening an attack against the U.S. Capitol today, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The threat was transmitted Monday on a radio frequency used by the Federal Aviation Administration facility that handles high-altitude traffic around the New York metropolitan region, one of these people said. It is among the FAA’s busiest air-traffic control centers, located in Ronkonkoma, N.Y.<br />The message likely was able to be transmitted, one person said, because the air-traffic control system is accessible by some portable scanners available to consumers, aviation buffs and pilots.<br />CBS News, which first reported the threat, played a recording of an apparently computer-generated voice saying: “We are flying a plane into the Capitol Wednesday.” The message indicated the motivation was to avenge the U.S. government’s 2020 assassination of a prominent Iranian military leader, Gen. Qassem Soleimani.<br />Lawmakers were set to gather on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday for a joint session of Congress to ratify the electoral win of President-elect Joe Biden."
