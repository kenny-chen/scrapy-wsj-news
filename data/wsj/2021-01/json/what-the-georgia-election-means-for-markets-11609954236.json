    "body": "Politics often matters to investors, but the way it matters isnâ€™t always obvious.<br />Compare the market reaction to Donald Trump winning the White House in 2016 and the immediate response to the prospect of a Democrat twin-win in Georgia, which gives the party control of the Senate (just).<br />In 2016, bank stocks soared while technology stocks initially fell and then lagged behind the market for months. Students of politics had an easy explanation: Republicans favor Wall Street, while Silicon Valley is a progressive bastion.<br />Easy, but wrong, as the Georgia Senate vote showed. The investor response to the Georgia vote (yet to be final, but interpreted by prediction markets as a sure thing for the Democrats) was to buy banks and sell Big Tech.<br />Sure, politics has shifted, and  Facebook  and  Amazon  are now treated as baddies by many on the left. The possibility of higher capital-gains taxes should hit stocks that have left investors sitting on fat unrealized profits, too."
