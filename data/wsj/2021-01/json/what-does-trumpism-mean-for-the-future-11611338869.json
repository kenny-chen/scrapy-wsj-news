    "body": "Regarding Gerald F. Seib’s “Where Trump Came From—And Where Trumpism Is Going” (Review, Jan. 16): Trumpism isn’t limited to supporters of Donald J. Trump. It is a style of political and social behavior practiced by a wide swath of those on the left and right, which employs personal invective and emphasizes hatred of “the other.”<br />What we need is centrist politicians of both major parties to actively demonstrate cooperation and compromise and take back control. So far, they do not seem willing to do so.<br />Martin S. Nowak<br />Viera, Fla.<br />"
