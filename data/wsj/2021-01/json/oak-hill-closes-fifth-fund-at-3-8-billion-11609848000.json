    "body": "Oak Hill Capital Partners has closed its latest fund at about $3.8 billion, significantly higher than the fund’s target.<br />The New York midmarket firm initially set a $3 billion fundraising goal for Oak Hill Capital Partners V LP, a Tuesday press release said.<br />The closing marks a new fundraising record for Oak Hill, which was formed in 1986 as the family office for Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass, and began raising funds from outside investors in 1999. The firm closed its fourth fund in 2017 with $2.65 billion, eight years after closing its third fund with $3.8 billion.<br />While Oak Hill’s fifth fund is approximately the same size as the third, the new vehicle represents the largest amount of outside capital the firm has ever raised, said Tyler Wolfram, the firm’s managing partner and chief executive.<br />Oak Hill’s latest fund received commitments from more than 100 limited partners from 25 countries, with more than 90% of the investors in the fourth fund also committing to the fifth, according to the news release. Mr. Bass remains a significant investor, as he has been in all previous Oak Hill funds, Mr. Wolfram said."
