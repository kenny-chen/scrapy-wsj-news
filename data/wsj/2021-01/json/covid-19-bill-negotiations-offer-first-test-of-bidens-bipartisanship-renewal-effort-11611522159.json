    "body": "<br />WASHINGTON—President Biden’s push for a sweeping coronavirus-relief bill is emerging as the first test of his pledge to bring a return of bipartisanship to Washington, a promise made more difficult as partisan lines are hardening in the Senate over the impeachment fate of his predecessor.<br />On Sunday, Brian Deese, head of the White House’s National Economic Council, is scheduled to confer with a group of lawmakers previously involved in bipartisan negotiations to discuss President Biden’s coronavirus-relief bill.<br />Mr. Biden earlier this month rolled out a $1.9 trillion plan that would provide an additional $1,400 in direct payments per person, topping off the $600 checks approved in December. The plan also includes money for rental assistance and food stamps, to extend federal unemployment assistance through September and increase the weekly federal subsidy to $400 from $300.<br />Some Republicans have raised concerns about the proposal’s price tag and the inclusion of unrelated, longtime Democratic policy proposals such as an increase in the minimum wage."
