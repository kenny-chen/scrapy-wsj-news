    "body": "Kamala Harris made history Wednesday as the first woman to be sworn in as vice president, alongside her husband, Doug Emhoff, who will become the first second gentleman.<br />Ms. Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, will also be the first Black vice president and first of Indian descent. In her role, she will serve as a counselor to President Biden and as the tiebreaker in an evenly divided Senate.<br />Ms. Harris, 56 years old, was sworn in on two Bibles: one that belonged to Regina Shelton, whom Ms. Harris considers a second mother, and one that belonged to Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court justice, who inspired Ms. Harris to pursue law. Ms. Harris also used Ms. Shelton’s Bible when she was sworn in as California’s attorney general and U.S. senator. Ms. Shelton helped take care of Ms. Harris and her sister while their mother worked when they were growing up.<br />Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice, was selected by Ms. Harris to officiate her swearing-in ceremony. She was escorted inside the Capitol by U.S. Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, a Black officer who redirected a mostly white mob away from lawmakers as they were being evacuated during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.<br />For some in attendance, watching Ms. Harris’s historic achievement was personal."
