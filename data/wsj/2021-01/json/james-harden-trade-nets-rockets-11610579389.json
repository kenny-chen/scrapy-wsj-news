    "body": "James Harden, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving now play for the same NBA team. What could go wrong?<br />The Brooklyn Nets made the biggest trade of the NBA season on Wednesday and created a team of temperamental superstars by dealing for Harden, the Houston Rockets’ virtuosic scorer and the league’s former Most Valuable Player, and making him the latest bearded millennial seeking reinvention by moving to Brooklyn.<br />But uniting Harden with Durant and Irving to declare themselves title contenders is also incredibly risky now and could be even costlier in the future. The haul of draft equity heading to the Rockets reportedly includes Brooklyn’s unprotected first-round draft picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026, when Harden, Durant and Irving are no longer under contract, and the right to swap picks with the Nets in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.<br />But wait. There’s more. Houston is also getting Victor Oladipo from the Indiana Pacers and another first-round pick in 2022 after expanding the deal to send Caris LeVert from the Nets to the Indiana Pacers and Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to the Cleveland Cavaliers.<br />The dizzying trade during an especially chaotic week in the NBA involves four teams, four draft picks, four pick swaps and at least four intriguing players—and one huge bet from the Nets."
