    "body": "PARIS—When President Biden announced the U.S. was rejoining the Paris climate accord, one of the first world leaders to welcome him back was President Emmanuel Macron of France.<br />The French leader had been a persistent critic of former President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the agreement, calling on world leaders to “Make Our Planet Great Again,” in an apparent riff on Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan.<br />In France, however, Mr. Macron is discovering how hard the agreement is to implement without imposing painful changes on the way people live in developed economies. France is falling behind the rest of Europe in reducing emissions, and Mr. Macron hasn’t settled on a strategy to meet the country’s pledges under the Paris accord.<br />Mr. Macron created an assembly of everyday citizens to come up with a sweeping plan to place France on a trajectory to become carbon neutral by 2050. But the assembly’s plan—which ranges from curbs on domestic flights to taxes on SUV sales—has now run into opposition from Mr. Macron himself.<br />“We need to make some adjustments,” said a close presidential aide, adding that some of the proposals were unacceptable to the public. Mr. Macron recently told the youth-focused news website Brut that the government needed to study the proposals’ economic impact, adding that it wasn’t up to the assembly to “anticipate everything, think of everything.”"
