    "body": "WASHINGTON—Government debt around the world shot up last year to approach levels last seen in the aftermath of World War II, as nations stepped up spending to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout, the International Monetary Fund said Thursday.<br />Public debt as a share of global gross domestic product surged to 98% by the end of December from 84% at the end of 2019, before the pandemic struck, the IMF said in an update to its semiannual Fiscal Monitor report. The IMF is the global lender of last resort to countries in distress and tracks debt levels closely. The total dollar value of global debt, which includes central and state government debt, came to $89.6 trillion at year’s end.<br />The increase was particularly large among advanced economies, which can easily borrow at low interest rates. The debt-to-GDP ratio among those nations rose to 123% by December from 105% in 2019, and it is expected to grow to 125% this year.<br />“From 2021 onwards, debt stabilizes at a high level and stays elevated well above the pre-Covid-19 level up to the end of” 2021, said Vitor Gaspar, director of the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department.<br />The IMF said governments should emphasize measures to combat the pandemic and cautioned against prematurely dialing back on spending."
