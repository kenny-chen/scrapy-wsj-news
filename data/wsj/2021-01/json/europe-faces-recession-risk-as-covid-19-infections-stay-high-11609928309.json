    "body": "The eurozone economy likely contracted in the final three months of last year, according to surveys of purchasing managers, as rising coronavirus cases and government restrictions weighed on activity in the dominant services sector.<br />With infection rates still high, there appears to be little prospect of a strong rebound in the early months of this year, and a risk that the currency area will fall back into recession.<br />But where new infections are relatively contained, the economic recovery continues. Similar surveys of Chinese and Australian service providers recorded a strong expansion of activity in December.<br />A survey of U.S. service providers to be released later on Wednesday is expected to point to steady and strong growth.<br />Data firm  IHS Markit  Wednesday said its purchasing managers index for the eurozoneâ€™s services sector rose to 46.4 in December from 41.7 in November. A reading below 50.0 points to a decline in activity, while a level above that threshold points to an increase."
