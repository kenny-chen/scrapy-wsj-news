More than 100 of thems were freed in 2016 and 2017 after a ransom payment and the release of some Boko Haram fighters by the government.<br />“Halima was in tears. She told us she was with the military and needed some clothes because she had nothing,” her brother Muhammad Maiyanga said. “We never thought we’d see her again.”<br />Ms. Maiyanga, now 22 years old, was 15 when she was kidnapped on the night before her year-end exams. Her older sister Maryam Ali Maiyanga managed to escape in 2017 along with an infant son born after her forced marriage to a jihadist fighter."
