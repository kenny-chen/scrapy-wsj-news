    "body": "Lending startup SoFi is going public through a combination with the special-purpose acquisition company  Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V ,  in a deal that values the company at $8.65 billion, the companies said.<br />The company, officially named Social Finance Inc., began as a student loan refinance business and has expanded to mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, insurance, investing and deposit accounts on its platform for its 1.8 million members.<br />The companies on Thursday said they expect the transaction to provide up to $2.4 billion in cash proceeds, including a fully committed private investment in public equity of $1.2 billion and up to $805 million in cash held in the blank-check company’s trust account.<br />Also known as blank-check companies, SPACs effectively turn the traditional model for initial public offerings on its head by raising money before they develop a business. They use the proceeds to make an acquisition—usually within a couple of years—that converts the target into a public company.<br />The SPAC is one of the investment vehicles run by Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and managing partner of venture-capital firm Social Capital LP and a former  Facebook Inc.  executive, and Ian Osborne, co-founder and chief executive of venture-capital firm Hedosophia."
