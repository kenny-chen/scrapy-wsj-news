    "body": "The mythical Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the poor. It was no accident that the brokerage firm that finds itself in the news lately chose that name, even if its novice customers often unwittingly did the opposite until this week when they rocked the hedge-fund world.<br />Robinhood’s customers were enraged on Thursday when it halted new buy orders on stocks like  GameStop ,  furthering the belief that fat cats were once again rigging the market against the little guy. Ironically, though, a misplaced target of their ire was Robin Hood, a New York charity that most definitely helps the poor. It was forced to respond over and over again to angry traders on Twitter.<br />Also ironic is that the escapades of Robinhood’s brokerage clients probably made a dent in the fortunes of some of the eponymous charity’s donors. The charity organization’s board includes hedge-fund stars David Einhorn, Paul Tudor Jones, Larry Robbins and David Tepper. Steven A. Cohen, an emeritus board member, certainly took a financial hit this week as his Point72 Asset Management was forced to come to the assistance of his former protégé at Melvin Capital Management, which made disastrous short bets on GameStop.<br />It is all fun and games until someone loses a charitable deduction.<br />Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com"
