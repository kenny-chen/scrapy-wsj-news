    "body": "WASHINGTON—Businesses prepared for an era of stricter regulation Wednesday as President Biden ordered a review of dozens of environmental policies—foreshadowing more stringent efficiency requirements for auto makers and appliance manufacturers, new limits on mining and drilling on federal lands and tougher emissions standards for power plants.<br />The actions were aimed at reversing former President Donald Trump’s deregulatory push in environmental regulation, prompting optimism among many executives backing renewable technologies, but irking others.<br />Fossil-fuel companies are likely to be among Mr. Biden’s biggest opponents. Mike Sommers, president and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, used his annual address last week to strike a conciliatory tone at times, saying it wanted to work with Mr. Biden on emissions limits and trade policy.<br />But he also said the group would aggressively defend the industry on core interests, especially access to federal lands and offshore oil.<br />“The bottom line for us is that we are going to work with the Biden administration when we can, but we will oppose them when we must,” Mr. Sommers said. “We will do everything we can to fight for the oil-and-gas industry across the United States.”"
