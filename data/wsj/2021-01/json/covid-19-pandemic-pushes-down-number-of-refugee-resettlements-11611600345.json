    "body": "A fraction of the nearly 1.5 million refugees in urgent need of resettlement were resettled through the United Nations last year, in part because of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Those entering the U.S. fell to the lowest level in the 40-year history of its refugee program, according to State Department data, after former President Donald Trump set the ceiling for 2020 at 18,000. Fewer than 12,000 refugees were admitted during the fiscal year that ended in September, owing in part to a temporary moratorium because of the pandemic.<br />President Biden pledged during his campaign to reverse many of Mr. Trump’s restrictions on immigration and committed that the U.S. would take in 125,000 refugees a year, a move welcomed by the U.N.<br />Mr. Biden has yet to raise the ceiling for 2021, but he has made several other immigration-related changes, including reversing the so-called Muslim travel ban and ending construction on a wall along the border with Mexico.<br />“Long a strong advocate for refugees, Mr. Biden has made important commitments to restoring the refugee resettlement program and ensuring that human rights and humanitarian values are at the center of the U.S. asylum system,” U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said earlier this month."
