    "body": "Covid-19 descended on my household the week before Christmas, a fitting end to 2020. The symptoms, while miserable for those of us afflicted, could have been much worse. I am, after all, gratefully able to write this piece.<br />The kids, spring chickens, are back in fine fettle, but recovery for my wife, Devin, and me has been somewhat slower. The lingering symptom has been a maddeningly persistent brain fog.<br />For her, this manifests mainly in 3 p.m. feeling like 3 a.m., day after bone-wearying day. In my case, it’s less general grogginess and more a specific inability to see the humor I once saw all around me. But the events of a recent evening give me hope we’re both turning a corner.<br />On the night in question, Devin was dragooned into helping our son Finn, a sixth-grader, with his math homework. Based on what I overheard while passing the kitchen table, fractions were involved. Finn was struggling with a concept, and Devin was offering assistance that, while loving, was of dubious value.<br />“All you need to do is cross-multiply,” Devin instructed."
