    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court cleared the way for the first execution of an inmate suffering from Covid-19, rejecting claims that the coronavirus infection could lead to exceptional pain when receiving lethal doses of pentobarbital.<br />Corey Johnson was declared dead at 11:34 p.m. Thursday, the Justice Department said. He was executed at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind., for a killing spree he committed while part of a drug racket, the department said.<br />Earlier Thursday, the high court rejected pleas from Mr. Johnson and Dustin Higgs, the final inmate scheduled to die during the Trump administration, to stay their executions because they were infected with the coronavirus.<br />The court’s three liberal justices, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, voted to grant the stay.<br />Over the objection of Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, the court also denied Mr. Johnson’s separate petition seeking a stay to pursue claims that he was intellectually disabled and, therefore, constitutionally exempt from the death penalty."
