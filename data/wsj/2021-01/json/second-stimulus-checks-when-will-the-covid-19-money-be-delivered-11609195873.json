    "body": "President Trump on Dec. 27 signed into law a roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid package that provides a second round of stimulus payments to households, and the money is already flowing. Here is what we know about who will receive the payments and how they will receive the money.<br />Eligible households will get $600 per adult and $600 a child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round delivered earlier in the pandemic. That means a single parent with two children will get $1,800 now after receiving $2,200 in the spring.<br />In all, the government will spend $164 billion on the second round.<br />The payments start phasing out when individual adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000, when head-of-household income exceeds $112,500, and when income for married couples filing jointly exceeds $150,000. For individuals without children, the payments go to zero when income reaches $87,000; that is $174,000 for married couples.<br />The payments happening now are generally based on 2019 income and household size. However, people who arenâ€™t getting money now or who may be eligible for more money than they are getting now can still qualify with their 2020 information through their 2020 tax returns. That can happen for people whose income was above the limits in 2019 but declined in 2020 or for people who had a baby in 2020. In both situations, their ultimate benefit on the 2020 tax return could be larger than the payments they received last year and now."
