    "body": "Congratulations to Jared Diamond on his excellent article “MLB Elevates Negro Leagues to Major League Status” (Sports, Dec. 17). Sometimes forgotten is that, like major-league players, Negro League all-star teams also toured internationally. In 1927 a black team, the Royal Giants, barnstormed Japan, preceding the 1934 tour of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx. The Royal Giants featured future Hall of Fame players Biz Mackey and Andy Cooper. Mackey later tutored Roy Campanella in how to catch—lessons he later used in his great major-league career.<br />J.D. Thorne<br />Milwaukee<br /><br />Upon reading that the change in records will now include Negro League statistics, I was excited at the thought that Henry Aaron’s nine home runs while playing for the Indianapolis Clowns in 1952 would cause me to hear for the second time: “There’s a new home run champion of all time, and it’s Henry Aaron” (764 to Barry Bond’s 762.) But alas, they decided to truncate the statistics at 1948, when presumably Major League Baseball was picking off the best players from the Negro Leagues and thus making the league no longer on par with the majors."
