    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Two senators from opposite sides of the aisle were working Wednesday to build support for censuring former President Donald Trump over his rhetoric ahead of the Capitol riot as an alternative to proceeding to an impeachment trial likely to result in his acquittal.<br />The push from Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) and Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) comes a day after just five Republicans sided with Democrats in a vote testing lawmakers’ stances on whether the trial was constitutional. The trial is set to begin in earnest in February, and Democrats would need support from at least 17 Republicans to convict Mr. Trump.<br />Tuesday’s vote showed it is “extremely unlikely that President Trump would be convicted,” Ms. Collins said. “It seems to me that there is some value in looking at an alternative to proceeding with the trial.” Ms. Collins was one of the handful of senators to side with Democrats in the vote.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) rejected the suggestion that the Senate should set aside the trial and said Wednesday that the Senate would proceed as planned. “Make no mistake—there will be a trial, and the evidence against the former president will be presented in living color,” he said. He said the constitutional objections to the trial were an attempt by Republicans to avoid having to cast judgment on Mr. Trump’s actions.<br />Mr. Trump’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
