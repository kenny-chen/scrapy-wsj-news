    "body": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo defended his plan to accelerate Covid-19 vaccinations from criticism by some local elected officials after a slow rollout of the shots.<br />The Democratic governor said the state would begin fining hospitals that don’t administer their full allotment of doses by the end of the week. Health-care workers as well as residents and staff at long-term-care facilities like nursing homes are currently eligible for vaccination in New York.<br />Mr. Cuomo also publicly disclosed which hospital systems had distributed doses at the lowest rates.<br />“We embarrassed some hospitals that were slow performers,” he said at a news conference Tuesday. “If you are not doing your job with a vaccine that could be a matter of life and death, then people have a right to know.”<br />New York City’s public hospital network was near the bottom of the state’s ranking of health-care systems and vaccine distributions. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, also a Democrat, said Mr. Cuomo’s efforts were unproductive."
