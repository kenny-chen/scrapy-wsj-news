    "body": "General Motors Co.  is launching a new electric-truck business geared toward delivery services, the latest in the company’s efforts to commercialize battery technology it is developing in-house.<br />Following the news, shares of GM hit their highest mark since the stock’s  initial public offering in 2010.<br />The Detroit auto maker said Tuesday it would begin making electric delivery trucks and motorized dollies as part of a division, called BrightDrop, that aims to capitalize on the now-booming market for e-commerce and home delivery.<br />The new division plans to roll out later this year an electric truck designed specifically for commercial purposes; named the EV600, it will offer a 250-mile range on a single charge. The move pits GM against  Ford Motor Co.  and its recently introduced electric delivery van, as well as electric-vehicle startups such as Rivian Automotive, which is making plug-in vans for Amazon.com Inc.<br />FedEx Corp.  is expected to be the first customer for the EV600, with the package-delivery company agreeing to purchase 500 of the new electric trucks for delivery later this year, GM said."
