    "body": "NEW DELHI—India started a massive vaccination campaign this weekend, hoping to use its unique skills at mobilizing millions to progress quickly in its efforts to protect its populace from Covid-19.<br />Hundreds of thousands of health-care workers—the first people to get the vaccines—lined up across the country to get their shots, in a nationwide effort that tapped the talents of millions of people to make, deliver, register, administer, monitor and protect the shots, said India’s Health Minister Harsh Vardhan.<br />India is starting with a target of around 300,000 doses a day but will ramp up as more vaccine becomes available to more than one million a day, Mr. Vardhan said. The country aims to have inoculated 300 million of its 1.3 billion people by August.<br />“This is a huge exercise,” said Mr. Vardhan, who wrote a book about India’s efforts to eradicate polio. “India has tremendous experience in handling these issues.”<br />While some countries have struggled with the scale and complexity of a nationwide vaccine drive, India is confident it can do better because of its experience inoculating its poor populace and maintaining election infrastructure for close to one billion voters."
