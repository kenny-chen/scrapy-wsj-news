    "body": "Bitcoin got the new year off to a scorching start as investors continued to pile on bets that the digital currency’s price will keep rising.<br />The price of bitcoin rose as much as 19% over the weekend, trading as high as $34,452 on Sunday, according to CoinDesk. It finished 2020 at $28,966, more than quadrupling on the year.<br />Bitcoin has been on an extended rally since early September, part of the “everything rally” that has fueled gains in stocks, emerging markets and other assets.<br />In many respects, what has happened in the first few days of 2021 resembled a stock market “short squeeze,” said AvaTrade analyst Naeem Aslam. He was referring to the cascade of buying that can happen when investors respond to a price jump by buying back stock they have sold in an effort to keep their losses from mounting.<br />It wasn’t just bitcoin that took a wild ride. The price of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, rose as much as 35% over the three-day weekend, trading above $1,000 for the first time since early 2018. Ether added to those gains Monday, most recently up 15% at $1,036."
