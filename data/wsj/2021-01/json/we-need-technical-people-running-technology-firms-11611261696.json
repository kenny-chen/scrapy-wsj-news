    "body": "The departure of Bob Swan as CEO of  Intel  (“Intel’s Board Ousts CEO,” Page One, Jan. 14) should not be a surprise to anybody who understands technology companies. The leader must be a technologist, no matter how bright any other candidate might be.<br />I experienced a similar situation when Intel’s Andy Grove decided to retire from day-to-day operations. I refused even to be considered, as my training didn’t give me the necessary ability to make the right decisions for the technical future of the company.<br />Intel needs to regain technical leadership, or at least technical parity with TSMC and Samsung—and the Chinese. Anything that gets in the way of that needs to be pushed aside. Having a board of directors with almost no technologists is wrong and needs changing.<br />In my day, Samsung was used as a contract manufacturer for older chips and was way behind technologically. Intel needs to focus its energy to get back to those days and everything else will follow.<br />Larry Hootnick"
