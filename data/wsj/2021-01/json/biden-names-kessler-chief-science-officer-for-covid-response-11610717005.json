    "body": "WASHINGTON—David A. Kessler, who led the Food and Drug Administration under two presidents, has been named chief science officer for Covid-19 response under the Biden administration.<br />In his new role, Dr. Kessler, 69 years old, will help lead the initiative the Trump administration dubbed Operation Warp Speed—rushing the production and distribution of vaccines and newly developed Covid drugs throughout the U.S.<br />Because the current speed of vaccinations has lagged behind expectations, the post will be vital in trying to accelerate the vaccination rate and stem the virus’s spread.<br />Dr. Kessler has said his priorities in the new job involve getting vaccines to all Americans who want them, rushing the production of Covid drugs and building long-term vaccine manufacturing capacity so the U.S. is prepared within months to face future pandemics.<br />During his tenure as FDA commissioner from 1990 to 1997, Dr. Kessler presided over such landmark moves as the creation of nutritional fact labels for food. He bolstered the FDA’s enforcement efforts, including the creation of the Office of Criminal Investigation."
