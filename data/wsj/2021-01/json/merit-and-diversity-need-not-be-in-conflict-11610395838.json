    "body": "Regarding Joseph Epstein’s “The Tyranny of Diversity” (op-ed, Dec. 31): Mr. Epstein questions the “true value” of diversity based on race, color and gender in progressive politics and work culture, and takes President-elect Joe Biden’s efforts for a diverse cabinet as one example. He suggests that the best way to celebrate diversity is to begin by celebrating “diversity of thought,” which can stem from “the value of true merit, or the real abilities of the people chosen to perform their jobs.”<br />What seems amiss here is that Mr. Epstein seems to insinuate that the race, color and gender type of diversity happens often as a trade-off to merit and accomplishment. But as made obvious by the résumés of President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet picks, to think that a candidate is picked for a job based on a race, color or gender factor alone is an outdated notion. Merit is the sine qua non in these competitive times. If anything, race, color and gender just add to enriching the diversity of thought.<br />Heidi H. Cha<br />New York<br />"
