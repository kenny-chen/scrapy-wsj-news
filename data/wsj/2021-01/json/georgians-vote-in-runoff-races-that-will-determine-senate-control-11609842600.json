    "body": "DALTON, Ga.—Georgia voters take to the polls Tuesday for two Senate runoffs that will determine which party controls the chamber, an outcome that could curb or expand the scope of President-elect Joe Biden’s legislative agenda.<br />More than 3 million votes have already been cast in early in-person voting and mail-in ballots underscoring high interest in the two races, which have drawn unprecedented campaign spending and national attention to the Peach State.<br />“If you’re a Georgia voter, if you want your values reflected by your elected officials, I strongly beg and encourage you, go vote tomorrow,” Gabriel Sterling, voting system implementation manager at the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, said Monday afternoon.<br />One election pits Republican David Perdue, 71 years old, against Democrat Jon Ossoff, 33. Mr. Perdue spent the past six years as a Georgia senator and is up for reelection after his term ended on Sunday. Mr. Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, is seeking to win his first elected office.<br />In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, 50, is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. Sen. Loeffler was appointed to her post last year to fill a vacant seat. If she wins, she will become the first woman ever elected senator from Georgia. Mr. Warnock, 51, is pastor of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s former church. If he wins, he will be the first Black senator elected from Georgia."
