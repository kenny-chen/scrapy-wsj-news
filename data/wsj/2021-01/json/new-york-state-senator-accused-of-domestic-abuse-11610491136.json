    "body": "A Democratic New York state senator representing parts of the Bronx was stripped of his committee assignments on Tuesday after an alleged domestic abuse incident last week, a top lawmaker said.<br />Luis Sepúlveda, 56 years old, turned himself in Tuesday at a Bronx police precinct, a New York Police Department spokeswoman said. Mr. Sepúlveda was charged with criminal obstruction of breathing, a misdemeanor, in connection with an altercation with his wife, police officials said.<br />According to the officials, authorities received a 911 call for a domestic incident involving Mr. Sepúlveda and his wife early on the morning of Jan. 9. Officers who responded to the Daly Avenue residence said both spouses accused each other of assault, police officials said.<br />Mr. Sepúlveda didn’t return a call or text message seeking comment. His attorney, Marvin Raskin, said that the senator was awaiting arraignment in the Bronx, and that the arrest arose from a false accusation that sought to build leverage in a continuing divorce proceeding.<br />Mr. Raskin said Mr. Sepúlveda was estranged from his wife and said his client was the victim of “recurring physical violence.” The couple have a young child, Mr. Raskin said."
