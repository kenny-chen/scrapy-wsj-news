    "body": "The U.S. plans to designate the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen as a foreign terrorist group, a move some Western officials and aid agencies said would impede stalled peace talks and hurt the economy of an impoverished nation at risk of famine.<br />Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he intended to designate the Houthis and three of its leaders for the group’s “terrorist acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping.”<br />The designation, which will be implemented on Jan. 19, will “advance efforts to achieve a peaceful, sovereign, and united Yemen” free of Iranian influence, Mr. Pompeo said Sunday.<br />The Houthis said the U.S. designation would have military and economic consequences. “There will be an escalation from our side,” said Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a member of the group’s political council. “This of course will derail the peace process brokered by the U.N.”<br />Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the United Nations’ secretary-general, said Monday, “We are studying the announcement closely to assess its potential impact.”"
