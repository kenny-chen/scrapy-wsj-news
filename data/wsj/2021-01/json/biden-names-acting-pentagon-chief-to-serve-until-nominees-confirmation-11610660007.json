    "body": "WASHINGTON—The incoming Biden administration has selected David Norquist to serve as acting secretary of defense until the Senate can confirm his chosen nominee, Lloyd Austin, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Mr. Norquist is now serving as the deputy secretary of defense under the Trump administration. The potential confirmation for Mr. Austin, whom President-elect Joe Biden named in December, isn’t expected to come until after Mr. Biden is inaugurated Jan. 20, requiring the Biden administration to name an individual to run the Pentagon in the interim.<br />John Kirby, a retired admiral who served as the top civilian communications adviser at the Pentagon, has been chosen to be the new press secretary at the Pentagon, officials said. The pick was first reported by the New York Times.<br />Mr. Norquist is considered a steady hand at the Pentagon, which has been led by five defense secretaries since President Trump took office in January 2017, officials said.<br />The Senate Armed Services Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over Mr. Austin’s nomination, will meet for its hearing on Jan. 19."
