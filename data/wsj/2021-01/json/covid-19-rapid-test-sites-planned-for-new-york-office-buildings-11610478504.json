    "body": "New York is working to open up Covid-19 rapid-testing sites at commercial buildings to help return workers to their offices, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday.<br />The expansion of rapid-testing facilities would allow the state to loosen social-distancing measures, including on theaters and restaurants, which have had to limit or close their operations during the pandemic, the governor said.<br />Several of New York’s largest landlords said Tuesday that they are participating in the effort. Scott Rechler, chief executive of RXR Realty, said that his company has identified six retail locations for Manhattan testing centers, one in a former Starbucks.<br />Mr. Rechler said the centers, which won’t be charging rent, will likely start opening in February and will all be open by the end of March. “The idea is to have the infrastructure in place in the middle of February and then by March, you’ll start seeing people come back to the workplace,” he said.<br />William Rudin, the head of one of the city’s real estate dynasties, said his company will likely provide at least two locations—one in Midtown Manhattan and the other in downtown—for Rudin office tenants."
