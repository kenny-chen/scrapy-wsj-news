    "body": "MOSCOW—Russia announced its intention to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, citing Washington’s decision to leave the agreement and a lack of progress in working out acceptable terms for Moscow’s continued participation in the agreement that allowed Russia and the West to carry out unarmed reconnaissance flights over each other’s territories.<br />The withdrawal will complicate any potential efforts from President-elect Joe Biden to re-enter the treaty after President Trump left it in 2020.<br />Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last year that European nations that remained in the treaty should sign a legally binding document affirming they would allow Russian planes fly over U.S. bases on their territory and wouldn’t share the data they collect on their flights over Russian territory with Washington.<br />“Due to the lack of progress in removing obstacles for the continued functioning of the agreement under new conditions, the Russian Foreign Ministry is authorized to announce the beginning of the withdrawal,” the ministry said Friday.<br />Write to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com"
