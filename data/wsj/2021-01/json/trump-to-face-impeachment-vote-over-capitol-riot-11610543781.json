    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House was set to vote to impeach President Trump on Wednesday for an unprecedented second time, alleging he encouraged a mob to storm the U.S. Capitol as part of an effort to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s election win.<br />At least several Republicans are expected to join all Democrats in approving an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump with less than a week to go in his term, as law-enforcement officials nationwide are bracing for more potential violence in Washington and in state capitals. After the vote, expected in the afternoon, the matter would go to the Senate, where the date of a trial, and the level of Republican support, is uncertain.<br />The president, in his first public appearance since the Capitol riot last week, said Tuesday he had no regrets about his remarks to supporters. He called the efforts to remove him from office over his comments a continuation of what he has termed a Democrat witch hunt.<br />House Democrats’ article of impeachment  alleges that Mr. Trump “willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the Capitol, such as: ‘if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.’”<br />Late Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence rejected a push from the House to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Mr. Trump over his role in the Capitol riot, setting in motion the House vote Wednesday."
