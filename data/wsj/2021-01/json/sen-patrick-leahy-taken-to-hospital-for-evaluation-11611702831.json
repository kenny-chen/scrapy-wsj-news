    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), who is set to preside over the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, was taken to a local hospital for evaluation after feeling unwell, an aide said on Tuesday.<br />Mr. Leahy, 80 years old, felt unwell while in his Capitol office this evening, the aide said. “Out of an abundance of caution, the Attending Physician recommended that he be taken to a local hospital for observation, where he is now, and where he is being evaluated,” the aide said in a statement.<br />Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said in an interview on CNN that Mr. Leahy’s wife had indicated that “things are going well.” Mr. Durbin said that “we have all got our fingers crossed he will be back tomorrow.”<br />Mr. Leahy is the longest-serving Senate Democrat, having first been elected in 1974. He is third in line for the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.)<br />The Constitution directs the chief justice of the United States to preside when the president is tried before the Senate, but is silent regarding former presidents. Chief Justice John Roberts presided over Mr. Trump’s first trial, which occurred when he was president."
