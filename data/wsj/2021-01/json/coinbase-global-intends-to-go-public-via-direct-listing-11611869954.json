    "body": "Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc. said Thursday it plans to go public through a direct listing, making the popular platform the latest company to forgo the traditional public-offering process.<br />The company said last month it had filed a draft registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering.<br />Direct listings differ from traditional initial public offerings in that companies take their shares to the stock market directly. Companies are able to save money that in a more traditional IPO would be shelled out to investment banks. This option to go public isn’t as common as traditional IPOs.<br />Data-mining company  Palantir Technologies Inc.  and streaming platform  Spotify Technology SA  both went public through direct listings.<br />Coinbase was started in 2012 and is the biggest exchange for cryptocurrency in the U.S. The San Francisco-based company was recently valued at around $8 billion and has more users than  Charles Schwab Corp.’s  platform."
