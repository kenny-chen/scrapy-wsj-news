    "body": "After years of shunning the U.S.’s two largest car companies, investors are finally starting to kick the tires on  General Motors Co.  and  Ford Motor Co.<br />Ford shares have surged about 20% this week and have risen about 35% in January, which would mark their best month since April 2009. The move this week followed a Deutsche Bank report suggesting Ford could give a brighter-than-expected profit outlook for 2021 when it reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 4.<br />GM’s stock price also has jumped about 35% this month, to a record level since shares began trading in 2010, following the auto giant’s bankruptcy a year earlier. The jump has come amid enthusiasm over GM’s electric-vehicle plans and  Microsoft Corp.’s  investment this week in Cruise, GM’s majority-owned autonomous-car division.<br />Investors have come to expect double-digit stock moves from  Tesla Inc.  and a bevy of electric-vehicle startups that have gone public over the last year. But until lately, Detroit’s auto makers haven’t benefited much from Wall Street’s fixation with electric and driverless cars.<br />The stock performance of both GM and Ford has trailed that of the S&P 500 index in each of the last four years, despite periods of record profit for each company."
