    "body": "Regarding William McGurn’s “Harvard Accuses Elise Stefanik” (Main Street, Jan. 19): Harvard doesn’t feel any need to list the specific offenses that, in its opinion, rendered Rep. Elise Stefanik (Harvard ’06) unfit to sit on the senior advisory committee of the Institute of Politics at its Kennedy School. After all, Ms. Stefanik wanted Congress to determine whether there was any basis in evidence that would support, or eliminate, concerns regarding our last presidential election. Shocking!<br />Americans once assumed they could trust the integrity of our electoral process. Harvard now holds that support for hearings to explore if any constitutional issues might have arisen in an unprecedented election is an infraction whose commission requires immediate banishment from “the marketplace of ideas.”<br />That is thought policing, which is certainly one way to “unify” Americans.<br />Julia Lutch<br />Davis, Calif."
