    "body": "Investors are hanging on to bonds that protect against inflation even as they sell other U.S. government debt, a sign many trust the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady even if the economy picks up steam.<br />The yield on the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security settled Wednesday at minus 1.049%, according to Tradeweb, compared with minus 1.032% on Tuesday.<br />The 10-year TIPS yield has climbed slightly from its record closing low of minus 1.115% set on Jan. 4 but not nearly as much as the yield on the regular 10-year Treasury note. That yield, a benchmark rate for borrowing costs throughout the economy, has jumped to 1.089% as of Wednesday’s close, from 0.915% on Jan. 4. Yields rise when bond prices fall.<br />Taken together, these moves suggest investors increasingly expect higher inflation, but not rate increases from the Fed, analysts said.<br />Over the past several months, market-based measures of investors’ inflation expectations have risen, based on the belief that a combination of coronavirus vaccines, increased government spending and continued support from the Fed will lead to a strong economic rebound this year."
