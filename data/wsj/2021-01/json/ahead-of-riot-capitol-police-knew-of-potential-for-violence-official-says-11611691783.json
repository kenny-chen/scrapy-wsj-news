    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. Capitol Police knew before the Jan. 6 rally by supporters of former President Donald Trump that the event could turn violent, but the department didn’t sufficiently prepare, the acting police chief said Tuesday.<br />In a closed-door Congressional hearing, acting Police Chief Yogananda D. Pittman said that by Jan. 4 the Capitol Police saw that the rally carried “strong potential for violence,” with extremists likely to attend.<br />“We knew that militia groups and white supremacists organizations would be attending,” Ms. Pittman told the House Committee on Appropriations, according to a copy of her testimony. “We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event. We knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.”<br />Ms. Pittman said on Jan. 4 her predecessor, Steven Sund, requested the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the department, declare a state of emergency and authorize a request for the National Guard to support the department’s officers.<br />The board denied the request, she said, and instead told Mr. Sund to contact the D.C. National Guard, which she said he did. Mr. Sund also coordinated with acting Police Chief Robert Contee at the Metropolitan Police Department, she said."
