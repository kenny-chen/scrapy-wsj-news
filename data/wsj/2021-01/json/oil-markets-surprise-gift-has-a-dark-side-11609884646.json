    "body": "Sometimes it takes a lot of oil to grease the palms of an unmotivated partner.<br />Saudi Arabia announced Tuesday—after another difficult meeting with members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led partners—that it would voluntarily cut its own oil production by a million barrels a day in February and March.<br />The most charitable interpretation is that Saudi Arabia is acting out of magnanimity. It understands that OPEC+ members are struggling and would like to make a gesture of goodwill. A more realistic read is that the Kingdom’s hand has weakened considerably in its tug of war with Russia regarding the direction of global oil output.<br />In a press conference Tuesday, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud stressed that the decision was made unilaterally. Yet he also said Russia was aware of its plans to announce a cut.<br />Despite Saudi Arabia’s large capacity, a million barrels is a substantial sacrifice, equating to roughly 9% of its typical production. The amount is also symbolically a departure from the parallel path that Saudi Arabia and Russia had taken so far; the countries had been holding back an equal number of barrels."
