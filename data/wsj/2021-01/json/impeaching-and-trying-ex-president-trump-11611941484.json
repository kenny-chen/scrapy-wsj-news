    "body": "Your editorial “Trying Mr. Trump, Private Citizen” (Jan. 26) makes the case that a trial may strengthen Mr. Trump. You go through all sorts of scenarios and outcomes and conclude that President Biden should have asked that the trial be dropped. I respectfully disagree.<br />If there are no consequences for subversion and insurrection, it may encourage future presidents to do the same thing. Nothing is more important in a democracy than the peaceful transfer of power.<br />The process could hurt Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney and may result in President Trump being politically strengthened. So what? There is no way of knowing what will result from this, but it should not stop the pursuit of justice.<br />What is the right thing to do, not the expedient or politically savvy, but the right thing? As Sen. Mitt Romney said recently: “what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense. If not? what is?” I don’t think there is any question here.<br />Cathy Putnam"
