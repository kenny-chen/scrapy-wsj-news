    "body": "The Arizona man who stormed the Capitol last week in a coyote tail headdress, armed with a six-foot spear and a bullhorn, left a menacing note for Vice President Mike Pence on the Senate dais, federal prosecutors said in a court filing arguing for his detention.<br />Prosecutors said Jacob Chansley, who calls himself the QAnon Shaman, incited fellow Trump supporters rioting inside the Capitol building and disobeyed police orders. Shortly after Mr. Pence was hustled out of the Senate Chambers, Mr. Chansley entered the room, climbed to Mr. Pence’s dais, and posed for photographs, prosecutors said.<br />According to prosecutors, Mr. Chansley, 33 years old, also left a note for Mr. Pence: “it’s only a matter of time, justice is coming.”<br />Prosecutors had initially said in court filings that Mr. Chansley and other rioters intended to capture and assassinate lawmakers at the Capitol. On Friday, Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which is leading the sprawling investigation, said there was no direct evidence of capture and kill teams.<br />The new information about the role of Mr. Chansley—whose painted face and colorful attire made him the most recognizable participant in the riot—came in a detention brief filed by prosecutors on Thursday."
