    "body": "House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy worked to patch up his relationship with Donald Trump in a meeting in Florida on Thursday, a sign of the former president’s continued sway over the party despite his loss in November and his impeachment this month over the Capitol riot.<br />Mr. Trump’s political committee in a statement described the meeting between the two men as “very good and cordial,” with their top priority being taking control of the House in 2022 after narrowing the Democrats’ majority in 2020. They will work together on that, the statement said.<br />Mr. McCarthy said in a statement that Mr. Trump “committed to helping elect Republicans in the House and Senate” and that “a united conservative movement will strengthen the bonds of our citizens and uphold the freedoms our country was founded on.”<br />The meeting was requested by the California congressman, who is trying to tamp down intraparty tensions as Republicans set their course in the post-Trump era. Mr. McCarthy for months stuck by Mr. Trump and declined to call President Biden the winner of the election, but later criticized Mr. Trump over the Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol.<br />“They are making sure they say kumbaya,” said a Trump adviser familiar with the meeting at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. “I’m sure the president thought Kevin went too far. In fact, I’m certain he did. Kevin asked for the meeting to make sure he’s in good shape.”"
