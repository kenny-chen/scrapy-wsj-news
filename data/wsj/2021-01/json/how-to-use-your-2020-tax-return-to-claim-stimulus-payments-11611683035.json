    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Internal Revenue Service is basically done sending out stimulus checks, after finishing a first round in the spring and summer and a second round in December and January. But there are still billions of dollars that some households can claim—through their 2020 tax returns.<br />Here are some key questions and answers:<br />No. The first round was $1,200 per adult and $500 per child and the second was $600 per adult and $600 per child. Anyone who received all of that money doesn’t need to do anything. And the stimulus payments aren’t taxable income.<br />There are several categories of people who might not have received their full stimulus payments. Because the payments were based on 2018 or 2019 income and household size, some people may be eligible based on their 2020 status—even if they weren’t eligible for an upfront payment.<br />That can happen if income changed. The payments start phasing out when income reaches $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples. So a single person who earned $125,000 in 2018 and 2019 and $70,000 in 2020 would have received no payments but would be able to claim both stimulus payments on the 2020 tax return for a total of $1,800."
