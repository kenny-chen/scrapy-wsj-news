    "body": "Chuck Schumer has finally achieved his long-time dream of becoming Senate Majority Leader. Pity, then, that he is acting as if he lives in mortal political fear of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.<br />On Monday Mr. Schumer called for President Biden to declare a national climate emergency, which would give the new Administration sweeping authority to circumvent Congress. This echoes Donald Trump’s declaration of a phony immigration emergency in 2019 to divert money from other federal accounts to build his wall on the Southern border.<br />“Now, Trump used this emergency for a stupid wall, which wasn’t an emergency,” Mr. Schumer said on MSNBC. “But if there ever was an emergency, climate is one. So I would suggest that they explore looking at climate as an emergency, which would give them more flexibility.”<br />By “flexibility,” Mr. Schumer means unilateral power to redirect federal funds for climate projects and subsidies, block oil exports, suspend drilling projects and perhaps stop the transport of all fossil fuels. All of this would be illegal in our view without explicit Congressional approval, and would be challenged in court, but the “emergency” strategy has been emerging on the left for some time.<br />We warned Republicans that Democrats would cite Mr. Trump’s use of emergency powers as a precedent for their policies. And now here we are."
