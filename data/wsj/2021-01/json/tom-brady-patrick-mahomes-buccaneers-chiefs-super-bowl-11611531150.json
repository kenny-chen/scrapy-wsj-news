    "body": "Tom Brady is back in the Super Bowl.<br />So is Patrick Mahomes.<br />Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers upset the Green Bay Packers 31-26 in the NFC Championship before Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs dispatched the Buffalo Bills 38-24 in the AFC Championship. It sets up a matchup between the last two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl. One is the greatest quarterback of his generation. The other is the greatest quarterback of the next one.<br />It was just two years ago that Brady and Mahomes met in the AFC Championship, but that was a lifetime in NFL years. Brady was a New England Patriot back then, and Mahomes was in his first season as a starting quarterback. The Patriots won that thriller in overtime on their way to their sixth Super Bowl title.<br />Everything changed over the next year—and quickly. Mahomes and the Chiefs won it all the next year. Brady and the Patriots bowed out quickly and quietly. Brady, after two decades in New England, decided to go to Tampa Bay."
