    "body": "Federal Reserve officials last month broadly supported new plans to guide the steady growth of their $7.4 trillion asset portfolio, but they didn’t see a strong case to boost the economic stimulus the asset purchases provide.<br />Since June, the central bank has been buying $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities a month—initially to stabilize markets and later to support the economy by holding down long-term interest rates. Minutes of the Fed’s Dec. 15-16 policy meeting indicated officials saw a high bar for dialing up that support by increasing the amount or changing the composition of those purchases.<br />“Participants generally judged that the asset purchase program as structured was providing very significant policy accommodation,” according to the minutes, which were released Wednesday.<br />The minutes also indicated that many officials were nervous about the potential for growth to stall in the winter amid a surge in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. But they also thought newly approved vaccines had reduced the chance of worse-than-anticipated economic outcomes later in 2021.<br />“A number of participants saw risks to economic activity as more balanced than earlier,” the minutes said."
