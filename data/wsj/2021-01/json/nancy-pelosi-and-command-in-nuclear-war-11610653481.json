    "body": "Regarding your editorial on Speaker Nancy Pelosi (“A Coup of Her 0wn,” Jan. 9) and despite your having “scoured the U.S. Constitution” for her authority, she has every right and indeed obligation as speaker and No. 2 in succession after the vice president to be reassured precisely of the constitutional role of the U.S. military in a national crisis. Many of us, too, want to be reminded of the military’s role which I’m sure Gen. Mark Milley provided precisely and graciously to the speaker.<br />I, like many others, had forgotten that during the Cold War Congress removed restrictions on the president to launch a nuclear attack and gave sole and unilateral power to the president. That needs to be changed, regardless of who is president. Remember that the Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to declare war.<br />Phillip Ringdahl<br />Rehoboth Beach, Del.<br />I doubt that even Nancy Pelosi truly believes that a president who has drawn down U.S. troops world-wide, pledged to keep us out of “never-ending wars,” fostered historic peace agreements in the Middle East and established a dialogue with rogue nations like North Korea, will suddenly begin launching nuclear strikes as he leaves office. This isn’t the way to begin the healing process."
