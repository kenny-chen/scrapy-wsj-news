    "body": "Verizon Communications Inc.’s  profit and sales slipped in the fourth quarter as higher costs burdened its bottom line, though the company issued a more upbeat view of its prospects in 2021.<br />The largest U.S. cellphone carrier said it expects wireless-service revenue growth to hit at least 3% this year while it continues to invest in upgrades to support fifth-generation wireless technology, also known as 5G. The company said capital spending would fall between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion in 2021.<br />Verizon ended 2020 with a quarterly net gain of 279,000 postpaid phone connections compared with a gain of 790,000 in the same quarter a year earlier. Telephone companies prize so-called postpaid accounts, which charge customers monthly bills after service is rendered, for their stable revenue.<br />Rival carrier  T-Mobile US Inc.  this month issued preliminary results that showed an 824,000 postpaid-phone gain over the same span.  AT&T Inc.  plans to report its fourth-quarter results Wednesday.<br />Verizon last year pulled its sales projections and braced for a wave of past-due bills as millions of Americans lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the year wore on, revenue losses were limited by Verizon’s more affluent customer base and the must-have nature of cellphone and home-internet service."
