    "body": "Marc Lore, the e-commerce entrepreneur who ran  Walmart Inc.’s  counterattack against  Amazon . com Inc., is leaving the retail giant after much of the online operations had been absorbed into the rest of its business.<br />Mr. Lore, who founded Jet.com and joined Walmart in 2016 after it bought his startup, pushed the bricks-and-mortar giant to increase its online offerings, including adding more web inventory and distribution centers.<br />But in recent years many of his areas of oversight had been combined into Walmart’s store operations. Walmart shut down Jet.com to focus on Walmart.com, and its e-commerce executives and teams reported to the head of Walmart’s U.S. stores.<br />Walmart said Mr. Lore, its U.S. e-commerce chief, will retire on Jan. 31 and stay as a consultant through September. The company said it unified its U.S. store and e-commerce operations in 2020. Following Mr. Lore’s exit, the business will continue to report to John Furner, the company’s U.S. chief executive.<br />“I think we had a five-year plan on what we wanted to accomplish and I think we largely did exactly what we set out to do,” said Mr. Lore in an interview. “The hope was that by that time we would converge the e-commerce and stores into one omni-organization and we would have one leader.”"
