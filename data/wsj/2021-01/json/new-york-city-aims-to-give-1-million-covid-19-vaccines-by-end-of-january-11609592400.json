    "body": "New York City officials plan to administer 1 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of January, as the city moves to increase vaccination efforts beyond health-care workers and first responders and into communities hit hard by the coronavirus.<br />Mayor Bill de Blasio said the goal was attainable, although challenging, and would include opening up 250 vaccination sites inside school gymnasiums, community health centers and at some facilities currently used to test for the virus.<br />The city would also need support from the federal and state governments, including additional authorization to vaccinate those who are in groups of different priority for receiving the shot, the mayor said.<br />“We need to go into overdrive now. We need every day to speed up and reach more people,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference Thursday.<br />So far, the city has administered a fraction of the vaccines it has received since being granted authorization in mid-December, according to city data. As of Dec. 31, the city has administered 88,410 doses of the more than 430,000 it has received, according to city data. The priority has been among health-care workers, and most vaccine doses have been given at local hospitals and nursing homes, officials said."
