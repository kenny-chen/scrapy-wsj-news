    "body": "Zico Beverages LLC founder Mark Rampolla is bringing his beverage baby back home after seven years apart.<br />PowerPlant Ventures, a venture-capital firm co-founded by Mr. Rampolla that backs emerging plant-based products and brands, acquired coconut water-based beverage brand Zico from the  Coca-Cola Co.  and will rename it Zico Rising.<br />The deal reunites Mr. Rampolla with a beverage brand he created in 2004 after discovering the benefits of coconut water while serving in Central America with the Peace Corps.<br />He ultimately sold the brand to  Coca-Cola  in 2013, several years after the beverage giantâ€™s corporate venturing arm invested in Zico.<br />But last year, when  Coca-Cola  announced it would scrap nearly 200 brands, including Zico, Mr. Rampolla saw an opportunity to rebuild the brand he had created."
