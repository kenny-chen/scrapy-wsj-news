    "body": "U.S. airlines had their worst year ever in 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, and a rebound in travel remains elusive for now.<br />Southwest Airlines Co.  lost nearly $3.1 billion last year—its first annual loss since 1972, the year after the Dallas-based carrier began flying. The airline lost $908 million during the fourth quarter.<br />American Airlines Group Inc.  reported a record $8.9 billion loss last year, and lost $2.2 billion during the fourth quarter. But losses at both American and Southwest were narrower than analysts expected.<br />Investors sent American’s shares on a wild ride Thursday. Shares soared by more than 80% before the market opened, but later pulled back and ended the day up 9.3% at $18.10. The company was named Wednesday on Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets forum, where retail investors have encouraged one another to pile into stocks with high levels of short interest, prompting extreme share price increases.<br />Shares of Southwest, which hasn’t attracted the same attention from short sellers as American, rose about 1% to $44.60."
