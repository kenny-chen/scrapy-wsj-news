    "body": "The U.S. is moving to assert a leading role in the global effort to end the coronavirus pandemic, restoring its ties with the World Health Organization and pledging to contribute to a world-wide vaccination drive.<br />The U.S. was on a track to withdraw formally from the United Nations public-health agency this coming July, a process set in motion last year by former President Donald Trump.<br />But President Biden, who had pledged during his campaign to reverse the retreat, sent a letter hours after his inauguration Wednesday to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres restoring U.S. ties with the WHO.<br />Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday that the U.S. will resume regular collaboration with the WHO, fulfill its financial obligations and cease a drawdown of U.S. staff from the agency.<br />The U.S., Dr. Fauci told members of a WHO gathering in a video appearance, will work with other partners “to reform the WHO, to help lead the collective effort to strengthen the international Covid-19 response and address its secondary impacts on people, communities and health systems around the world.”"
