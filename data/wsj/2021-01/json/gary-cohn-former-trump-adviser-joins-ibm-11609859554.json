    "body": "International Business Machines Corp. appointed Gary D. Cohn, a former  Goldman Sachs  executive and economic adviser to President Trump, as its vice chairman and member of its executive leadership team as the tech company tries to revive its fortunes.<br />Mr. Cohn, who brings a vast Rolodex of corporate and government contacts, will work on business development, public advocacy, client services and client-relationship management, IBM said.<br />Mr. Cohn is joining an iconic American tech company that is undergoing a once-in-a-generation overhaul after years of struggling for growth. IBM has reported declining revenue in 30 quarters over the past 10 years, and its stock price has lagged rivals, even though sales remain big, at more than $70 billion a year.<br />IBM appointed Arvind Krishna its CEO last year, announced layoffs and said it plans to split the company, carving out a large chunk of its IT-services operations that will leave the company far smaller and more focused on high-growth cloud computing business.<br />Mr. Krishna said Mr. Cohnâ€™s business-transformation skills would help IBM as it aims to accelerate its shift to cloud and artificial-intelligence businesses."
