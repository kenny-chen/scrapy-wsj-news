    "body": "Regarding Thomas Spence’s “Blacklists Are the Rage In Publishing” (op-ed, Jan. 19): Mr. Spence defends his decision to publish a book written by Sen. Josh Hawley after the original publisher, Simon & Schuster, canceled plans to do so. Simon & Schuster made that decision after Sen. Hawley objected to the certification of electoral votes following the riot inside the U.S. Capitol.<br />Mr. Spence certainly has the right to publish—or decline to publish—whatever he chooses. However, every publishing house, newspaper and magazine has the right to choose what is published under its banner, including a perceived lack of the opportunity to make a profit. This is not restricting anyone’s freedom of speech; it is making a business decision.<br />I suspect he is counting on the fact that controversy is likely to increase sales beyond what the book otherwise would have generated. In this era of self-publishing, it is impossible to prevent a book from being published, and Sen. Hawley could have taken that path. Mr. Spence appears to be seizing this moment, using the notoriety Sen. Hawley has gained, to generate publicity for his own business. That is his right, but let’s not pretend he is doing so to defend Sen. Hawley’s right to free speech.<br />Teri Geske<br />Los Angeles"
