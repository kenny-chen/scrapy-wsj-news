    "body": "SEOUL—A South Korean court ruled that Japan should compensate a dozen Korean women who were forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers during World War II, exacerbating already strained ties between the two U.S. allies.<br />The Seoul central district court on Friday said Tokyo should pay the plaintiffs around $90,000 each. Japan immediately rejected the ruling, saying the issue was settled in a 1965 treaty that normalized relations and an agreement in 2015 that provided financial support for the so-called comfort women.<br />“This is completely unacceptable,” Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said. “I strongly urge the South Korean government to take measures to correct this violation of international law.”<br />Japan’s foreign ministry summoned the South Korean ambassador in Tokyo to protest.<br />The ruling puts President-elect Joe Biden in an awkward position as his administration seeks to build a broad alliance of allies, said Jin Chang-soo, a Japan expert at the Sejong Institute, a think tank near Seoul."
