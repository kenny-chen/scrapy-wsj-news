    "body": "The Justice Department’s inspector general said Monday his office will investigate whether department officials “engaged in an improper attempt” to overturn President Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.<br />The announcement comes after news reports that former President Donald Trump considered moving to replace the acting attorney general with another official ready to pursue unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Mr. Trump pushed the Justice Department to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate Mr. Biden’s win.<br />Inspector General Michael Horowitz said in a statement that his office will probe “whether any former or current DOJ official engaged in an improper attempt to have DOJ seek to alter the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election,” adding only that the investigation will “encompass all allegations that may arise that are within the scope” of its jurisdiction.<br />Mr. Trump’s persistent efforts to involve the Justice Department in his attempts to undo the outcome of the November election failed due to pushback from his own appointees in the department, people familiar with the matter have said. The efforts have drawn sharp rebuke from Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), who announced Saturday that the Senate Judiciary Committee has initiated its own review of Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign at the Justice Department.<br />As part of that effort, Mr. Trump explored a plan to replace then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen with another senior Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, an ally who had expressed a willingness to use the department’s power to help the former president continue his unsuccessful legal battles contesting the election results, people familiar with the matter said."
