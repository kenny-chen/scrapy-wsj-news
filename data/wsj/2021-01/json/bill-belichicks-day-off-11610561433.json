    "body": "Bill Belichick has a day off. Even in placid times, this would be news, because this is the part of year when the Grumpy Lobster Boat Captain is ordinarily in his wheelhouse, hauling pots, steering in a hard, cold rain, trying to guide his New England Patriots to the Super Bowl for the five hundred billionth zillionth jillionth time.<br />Alas, the Patriots were not Super Bowl material this season, not even playoff material. Their 2020 season ended meekly, almost two weeks ago, with a modest triumph over the calamitous Jets. It was New England’s seventh win against nine losses, the franchise’s first losing record in 20 years.<br />Not very good. Not at all Patriots.<br />Still, Belichick expected to be busy this week. He was supposed to be in Washington, D.C., to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, from the outgoing President Trump. As everyone knows now, he won’t. On Monday, word arrived that Belichick was declining the medal. In a statement, Belichick made reference to the “tragic events” last week at the U.S. Capitol, and said “remaining true to the people, team and country I love outweigh the benefits of any individual award.”<br />Now Belichick has an empty spot in his calendar. The taciturn coach, who coined workplace-fetish phrases like “Do Your Job” and once chanted “No days off!” at a championship celebration, has given himself an uncharacteristic gift: free time."
