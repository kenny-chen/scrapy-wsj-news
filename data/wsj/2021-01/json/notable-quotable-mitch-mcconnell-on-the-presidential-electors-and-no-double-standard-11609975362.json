    "body": "From Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s remarks on the Senate floor, Jan. 6, 2021:<br /><br />Every election features some illegality and irregularity and it’s unacceptable. I support strong state-led voting reforms. Last year’s bizarre pandemic procedures must not become the new norm. But nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale that would have tipped this entire election.<br />Nor can public doubt alone justify a radical break when that doubt was incited without evidence.<br />The Constitution gives Congress a limited role. We cannot simply declare ourselves a national Board of Elections on steroids."
