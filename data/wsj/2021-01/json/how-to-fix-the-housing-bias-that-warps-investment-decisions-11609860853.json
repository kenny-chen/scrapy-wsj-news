    "body": "Overinvestment in real estate is a problem for the economy. A growing body of research suggests that it saps future output by sucking capital away from more productive uses. And housing is a particular culprit.<br />There are a number of possible ways to solve the problem—none of them easy.<br />Homeownership bias, meaning the incentive to invest in property rather than other assets, exists in the most of advanced economies. This means less money is invested in things that boost productivity like machinery and new technologies.<br />When thinking about how housing is taxed, it’s useful to think of ownership and actual use—as in living there—as separate economic categories. Owning a property is the investment side of the equation, but living there is a form of consumption.<br />If a homeowner rents out their property, that income is taxed. But when they live in it, essentially renting it to themselves, it isn’t. And that is the major advantage to homeownership over other forms of asset ownership: Imputed rents aren’t usually taxed."
