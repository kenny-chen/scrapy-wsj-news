    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House dismissed the top spokeswoman at the agency responsible for responding to a suspected Russian hack of government computer systems, amid disagreements over how the government is handling the breach.<br />Sara Sendek, the director of public affairs at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said the White House’s personnel office informed her Monday evening that her services were no longer needed and instructed her not to come to work after Tuesday.<br />The White House and CISA declined to comment. Ms. Sendek said she wasn’t given a reason for her dismissal, which was first reported by CyberScoop, a cybersecurity news site.<br />Her removal is the latest in a raft of dismissals of senior cybersecurity officials and comes as the Trump administration grapples with the  SolarWinds  hack. The breach was discovered last month and has compromised at least a half dozen cabinet departments and an unknown number of private companies.<br />Administration officials have jostled over how to respond to the hack, which current and former officials and cybersecurity experts have said amounts to one of the worst intelligence failures on record."
