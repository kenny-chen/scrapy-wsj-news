    "body": "U.S. stock futures wavered, putting Wall Street on course for a steady open after losses induced by concerns about a slowing economic rebound and froth in markets, exemplified by the wild trading in retailer GameStop.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked down 0.1% after the benchmark index posted its biggest two-day decline since October. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has fallen for five-consecutive days in its longest losing streak since February, rose about 0.1%.<br />Technology stocks appeared set to come under pressure, after earnings from giants including Apple underwhelmed investors late Wednesday, pushing Nasdaq-100 futures down 0.7%.<br />The stumble in stocks follows a strong start to the year that some investors say had pushed share prices beyond levels justified by corporate fundamentals. The selloff has taken place amid wild swings in individual stocks including GameStop and AMC Entertainment, fueled by a battle between day traders and hedge-fund professionals.<br />“There is some over-excitement in the market,” said Olaf van den Heuvel, chief investment officer for Aegon Asset Management in the Netherlands, pointing to the surge in GameStop shares as one example. “It was bubble territory.”"
