    "body": "President Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rep. Devin Nunes on Monday, bestowing the nation’s top civilian honor on a close Republican ally during the closing days of his presidency, the White House said.<br />Mr. Nunes, of California, was the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee when it conducted the Russia probe. He aggressively defended Mr. Trump during investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election and throughout the president’s impeachment trial in the House of Representatives.<br />The Democratic-majority House voted to impeach Mr. Trump on charges stemming from his efforts to press Ukraine to announce investigations that could benefit him politically. The Republican-led Senate acquitted the president.<br />In a news release, the White House praised Mr. Nunes for his role in attempting to discredit investigations of the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia, calling him “a public servant of unmatched talent, unassailable integrity, and unwavering resolve.”<br />In a 2019 report, special counsel Robert Mueller confirmed that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election and detailed contacts between the Russian operatives and members of the Trump campaign, but said the evidence didn’t establish a conspiracy or coordination between the two."
