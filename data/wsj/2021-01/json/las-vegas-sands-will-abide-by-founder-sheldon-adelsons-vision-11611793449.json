    "body": "Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s recently ascended leaders said Wednesday that the global casino operator’s future will hew closely to the vision of company founder Sheldon Adelson, who died earlier this month.<br />The company will continue to invest in its Singapore and Macau casinos, which generate most of the company’s revenue, and consider expansion opportunities in the U.S. in New York and Texas, company officials said on a call with Wall Street analysts Wednesday.<br />“The DNA of the company that Sheldon founded will be ever present,” said Sands Chief Executive Rob Goldstein, who was named Mr. Adelson’s successor this week.<br />Sands reported a 67% decline in revenue for the quarter that ended Dec. 31, the first such report since Mr. Adelson’s death. The casino magnate died Jan. 11 from complications of treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 87. The company began when Mr. Adelson and partners bought the old Sands Hotel casino on the Las Vegas Strip in 1989.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic has roiled the casino industry with temporary shutdowns, reduced travel and limited occupancies under social-distancing. Hopes for a recovery this year depend on how many tourists and business travelers will return as vaccines are distributed."
