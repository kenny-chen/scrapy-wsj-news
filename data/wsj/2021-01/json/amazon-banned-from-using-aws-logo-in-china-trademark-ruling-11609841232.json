    "body": "Amazon . com Inc. can’t use its cloud-computing business’s AWS logo in China, a Beijing court ruled, the latest headache for a company that has already been hampered by Chinese regulations and rivals.<br />The Beijing Municipal High People’s Court ruled that the trademark for the term “AWS” belonged to ActionSoft Science & Technology Development Co., a Chinese software and data services company, according to a court verdict published Dec. 30.<br />The court ordered Amazon to stop using the term AWS or any similar logos in China and pay compensation of 76.5 million yuan, equivalent to $11.8 million, to ActionSoft. The verdict was dated May 2020 but was released at the end of last month. Chinese courts often publish rulings months after they are made.<br />Neither Amazon nor Beijing-based ActionSoft replied to requests for comment.<br />On Amazon’s cloud-computing service website in China, the term AWS, which stands for Amazon Web Services, was still frequently used as of Tuesday. A note at the bottom of its main webpage said AWS is used as an abbreviation and “is not displayed herein as a trademark.”"
