    "body": "Procter & Gamble Co.  sales surged in the most recent quarter, fueled in part by demand for high-end household products from pricey dish soap to a $300 electric toothbrush.<br />Despite a tough economic picture and high unemployment, the maker of Gillette razors and Pampers diapers said consumers are increasingly willing to pay more for products. And P&G, armed with extra cash following years of downsizing and solid sales, has been churning out a range of high-end items including laundry-detergent pods designed for extra-large washing machines and a special line of Gillette shaving products. The shift comes as consumers stuck at home because of the coronavirus pandemic broadly are spending more to keep their homes and themselves clean.<br />The Cincinnati company’s organic sales increased 8% to $19.75 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. P&G raised its estimates for full-year organic sales growth to between 5% and 6%, up from the previous range of 4% to 5%.<br />“Consumers are driven to products where they can say, ‘I know that will deliver for me and my family,’ ” P&G operating chief Jon Moeller said in an interview.<br />The strongest growth was in P&G’s fabric and home-care unit, which posted a 12% sales gain. The unit’s brands include Tide, Mr. Clean, Dawn dish soap and Cascade dishwasher detergent. Sales in P&G’s grooming unit, which includes Gillette razors, rose 5%. Sales in P&G’s health-care unit, which includes dental care as well as over-the-counter medications, rose 9%."
