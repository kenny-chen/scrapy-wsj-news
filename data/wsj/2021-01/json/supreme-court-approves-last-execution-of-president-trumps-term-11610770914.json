    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department early Saturday executed Dustin Higgs, the 13th and final federal inmate to die before President Trump leaves office and President-elect Joe Biden, an opponent of the death penalty, is sworn in.<br />Mr. Higgs was pronounced dead at 1:23 a.m. The federal Bureau of Prisons said he was 48 years old. Mr. Higgs was convicted on three counts of first degree premeditated murder and three counts of kidnapping resulting in death.<br />The execution took place less than three hours after the Supreme Court, in a brief, unsigned order, lifted a stay issued by a federal appeals court. Three liberal justices dissented, with two criticizing the Trump administration’s rapid march to clear the federal death row through two executions per month since July.<br />In separate opinions, Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the condemned were put to death leaving unresolved claims regarding their mental capacity, exculpatory evidence, the risk of excruciating pain from lethal injection and other legal issues.<br />“None of these legal questions is frivolous,” Justice Breyer wrote. “What are courts to do when faced with legal questions of this kind? Are they simply to ignore them? Or are they, as in this case, to ‘hurry up, hurry up’”? he wrote."
