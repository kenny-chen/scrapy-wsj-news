    "body": "IG Group Holdings  PLC, a U.K.-based operator of online trading platforms, has agreed to buy U.S. brokerage and financial-media firm Tastytrade Inc. for $1 billion in a bid to capitalize on the boom in options trading by small investors.<br />The deal, which the companies unveiled Thursday, would substantially increase IG’s presence in the U.S. market. The company is best known for offering derivatives products that let individual investors overseas bet on whether stocks, foreign-exchange rates, gold or cryptocurrencies will rise or fall.<br />Founded in 1974 and listed on the London Stock Exchange, IG has expanded over the years from its U.K. base to Europe, Australia and Asia. In the U.S. it already owns Nadex, a small exchange for binary options, a type of exotic derivative contract.<br />Tastytrade, based in Chicago, caters to individuals seeking to trade options, with a brokerage arm called Tastyworks and a free online-video network featuring tutorials on trading strategies and interviews with veteran traders. About 900,000 people have registered for Tastytrade’s content, the firm says.<br />Options are contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell shares at a specific price later in time. Traders can use options to hedge their portfolios from stock declines or make bets that indexes such as the S&P 500 or individual companies will either go up or down in value."
