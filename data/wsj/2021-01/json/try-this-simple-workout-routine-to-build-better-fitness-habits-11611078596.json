Developed by veteran NBA sports performance coach Arnie Kander, this six-week program doesn’t require equipment and can be performed anywhere, even in small spaces.<br />CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE CHALLENGE.<br />Mr. Kander spent 25-plus years working with NBA teams, including the Minnesota Timberwolves and Detroit Pistons, for whom he still serves as a consultant. The 20-second step-up became his gold standard for measuring an athlete’s baseline level of fitness. “I’ve probably used it 1,000 times on professional athletes,” he says. It’s a very simple test that tells a lot about a person’s movement efficiency, balance response, coordination, reflexes, ankle flexibility and core strength.<br />Last spring, he challenged friends. A 94-year-old woman he knows completed eight steps up and down in 20 seconds. A former professional soccer player achieved 41 steps, up and down in 20 seconds. That’s nearly two steps per second."
