    "body": "Results from a clinical trial in Brazil have raised concerns about one of China’s leading vaccine candidates, but for some countries a lower efficacy rate isn’t a deal breaker.<br />Indonesian President Joko Widodo received a shot of the Sinovac BioTech Ltd. vaccine in a televised ceremony on Wednesday, after researchers in Brazil running a late-stage trial said it was only 50.4% effective.<br />Indonesia, Brazil and Turkey have already begun receiving early batches of the vaccine, called CoronaVac. On Wednesday, Turkey granted emergency approval to the vaccine, and the Philippines said that it still planned to use it as a part of its inoculation campaign.<br />“Differences in efficacy and choosing the highest efficacy aren’t the primary base of vaccine access in Indonesia,” said Penny Lukito, head of Indonesia’s National Agency of Drug and Food Control. Other important factors included finding vaccines that can be easily and safely distributed, she said.<br />In China, health regulators said on Wednesday that the country had already administered more than 10 million vaccine doses since Dec. 15, including an unspecified number from Sinovac, and was ramping up production capacity to distribute more."
