    "body": "BOGOTA, Colombia—A court in the African country of Cape Verde ruled that Alex Saab, a Colombian businessman who had been Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s deal maker, can be extradited to the U.S., where he was indicted on charges of laundering money for the authoritarian regime.<br />An appeals court issued the decision on Monday, rejecting claims by Mr. Saab’s attorneys that their client wouldn’t get a fair trial in the U.S. and that the case against him was politically motivated.<br />“The crimes for which the person facing extradition is pursued are not of a political nature and do not appear to be for political or ideological reasons,” the court said in a 46-page ruling.<br />Mr. Saab’s lawyers, led by former Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón, said on Tuesday an appeal would be made in the next few days to Cape Verde’s Supreme Court to prevent Mr. Saab’s extradition. Mr. Garzón and the legal team have argued that Mr. Saab, who was granted citizenship by Mr. Maduro’s government, had been on a commercial mission for the regime and had diplomatic immunity.<br />Mr. Garzón said pressure from the U.S. has made it a challenge to win the release of Mr. Saab, who was arrested in June when his private plane stopped to refuel at Cape Verde, an island country nearly 400 miles off West Africa."
