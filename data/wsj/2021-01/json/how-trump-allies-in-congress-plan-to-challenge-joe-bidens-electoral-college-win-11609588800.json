    "body": "Congress is set to hold a joint session Wednesday to ratify Democrat President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win in the November election, in a final step ahead of his Jan. 20 inauguration. Some Republicans plan to raise challenges to some of the states’ results, alleging election irregularities. Their objections could force debate and votes in both chambers of Congress.<br />None of the challenges are expected to succeed, but they could slow down the process, and they give Trump allies a high-profile chance to formally challenge the election results. Here are some questions and answers about how events will play out.<br />The law specifies that Congress is to convene at 1 p.m. Jan. 6 for a joint meeting to officially count and validate the 538 electoral votes that have been certified by the 50 states and District of Columbia.<br />Under the process, Vice President Mike Pence, acting in his constitutional role as the president of the Senate, opens up all the certificates reflecting the vote tallies sent by the states. He hands them to “tellers,” who are people appointed from the House and the Senate to read the ballots and verify the results. The tellers then read the states’ certificates in alphabetical order, starting with Alabama and ending with Wyoming, stating that the certificate from each state “seems to be regular in form and authentic.” Mr. Pence has the power to recognize any lawmaker who objects.<br />Any lawmaker can challenge a state’s Electoral College votes, but it takes one member of the House and one senator to formally object to a state’s result and bring the challenge to a vote by lawmakers. The objection must be in writing."
