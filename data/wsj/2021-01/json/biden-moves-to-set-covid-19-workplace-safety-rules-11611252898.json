    "body": "President Biden directed a federal workplace-safety regulator to require employers to develop coronavirus protocols and enforce compliance.<br />Mr. Biden asked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in a planned executive action Thursday to pursue an emergency temporary standard that would set Covid-19 workplace-safety requirements, as part of a series of executive orders this week.<br />“It is critical that the federal government protect the health and safety of America’s workers and take swift action to prevent workers from contracting COVID-19 in the workplace,” the Biden administration said a pandemic strategy document.<br />Labor and business groups expect OSHA to implement a rule quickly. The process for issuing an emergency standard isn’t as involved as the traditional federal rule-making process, in part because it lets government skip the usual public-comment period.<br />Many Democrats and worker advocates support developing a federal rule. Republicans and businesses worry that could become a burden for employers to implement."
