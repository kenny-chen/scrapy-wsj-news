    "body": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said that President Trump provoked the mob that stormed the Capitol earlier this month, for the first time publicly casting blame on the president for the violent attack.<br />“The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday.<br />Mr. McConnell has said he is considering whether he would vote to convict Mr. Trump during his second impeachment trial, which will take place after Mr. Trump leaves office. The House passed an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump last week, focused on his statements encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol.<br />How Mr. McConnell votes will be central to whether enough Republicans join Democrats in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump. A two-thirds supermajority is needed to convict in presidential impeachment trials, meaning 17 Republicans would need to support conviction for it to succeed.<br />Some Republicans, though, have said they don’t believe that holding an impeachment trial for someone who no longer holds office is constitutional. Democrats will soon control a majority in the Senate."
