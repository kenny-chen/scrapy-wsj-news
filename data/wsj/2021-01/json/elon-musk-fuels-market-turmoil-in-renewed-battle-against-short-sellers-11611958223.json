    "body": "Retail investors are taking short sellers to the cleaners at least for now, and Elon Musk is loving it.<br />The chief executive of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. has been sparring with Wall Street bears for years. This week, he has leveraged  Twitter  to help fuel the populist frenzy over  GameStop Corp.  and other companies to stick it to the short sellers once more.<br />“Here come the shorty apologists. Give them no respect. Get Shorty,” Mr. Musk tweeted Thursday to his more than 40 million followers.<br />On Wednesday, GameStop shares more than doubled after Mr. Musk tweeted “Gamestonk!!” the previous afternoon, linking to the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets. Stonk is a play on the word “stock.”<br />Mr. Musk has used Twitter to cultivate a devoted following of Tesla fans, benefiting from the kind of retail investor fandom that has propelled the stocks of GameStop and others such as  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc."
