    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Trump’s supporters plan to protest in Washington, D.C., Tuesday and Wednesday as Congress meets to ratify President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, marking the third such mass demonstration in the nation’s capital disputing the election results.<br />The Washington protests, like those before them, are expected to attract Mr. Trump’s supporters from around the country. City officials are bracing for potential violence downtown in a repeat of unrest stemming from earlier pro-Trump protests, and adding police officers to monitor historic Black churches that were vandalized following last month’s demonstrations.<br />Mainstream Trump supporters, private militia groups, white supremacists, the far-right Proud Boys and conspiracy theorists such as those backing QAnon are expected to attend, social-media posts and permits show.<br />The city plans to deploy National Guard members and to augment its police presence at the demonstrations, officials said Monday. The president, who ran on a platform of law and order during last year’s presidential election, hasn’t called for federal law enforcement to monitor the activity as he did during last year’s Black Lives Matter protests. A White House spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the president’s plans.<br />Permits granted by the National Park Service show several thousand people are expected at the main events on Wednesday, with at least one demonstration beginning on Tuesday afternoon. Protesters aren’t required to file for permits to engage in what is a First Amendment right."
