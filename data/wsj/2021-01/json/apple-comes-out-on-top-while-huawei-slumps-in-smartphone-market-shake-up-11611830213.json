    "body": "Apple Inc.  reasserted itself as the world’s No. 1 seller of smartphones in the fourth quarter thanks to record sales of its latest iPhone, while Huawei Technologies Co.’s device shipments collapsed under the weight of U.S. restrictions.<br />The data, released by mobile-phone-industry tracker International Data Corp. and others, showed a dramatic divergence in the smartphone market during the final months of 2020.<br />Apple’s smartphone shipments shot up by 22% in the fourth quarter, with 90.1 million devices shipped—the highest quarterly number of shipments for any vendor on record, according to IDC. The surge during Apple’s most profitable quarter was fueled by the success of the company’s iPhone 12 series and lifted Apple to the No. 1 spot in the quarter, with 23% of the total market, according to IDC.<br />The company often sees a bump in quarterly smartphone sales during the final quarter on the heels of its latest iPhone launch.<br />“It’s traditionally a very strong quarter for Apple, but Apple is starting to consolidate their lead,” said Nicole Peng, an analyst at research firm Canalys, which also placed Apple at No. 1 during the quarter. “It feels like it’s back to its peak time from several years ago.”"
