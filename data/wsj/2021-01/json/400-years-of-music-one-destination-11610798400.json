    "body": "<br /><br />Nashville, Tenn.<br />Exploring and presenting the story of 400 years of African-American music, and the genres, offshoots, influences and performers (famed and less so) that have derived from it, could seem a daunting task. Presenting that narrative in as accessible, engaging and meaningful a way as the music does itself is a greater challenge still.<br />Those are the goals of the Nashville-based National Museum of African American Music, nearly 20 years in the making, which has its “Virtual Ribbon Cutting” on Monday, Jan. 18—Martin Luther King Day—at noon Central time on the museum’s Facebook page and opens its doors to the general public on Jan. 30 after several members-only days. Videos from museum-sponsored performances and talks can be seen on its YouTube channel and the museum website, nmaam.org."
