    "body": "Young professionals who fled big cities for small towns during the pandemic are providing an unexpected boost to a type of real estate geared toward communal living.<br />Many of those who left were seeking fresh air, more space and distance from infection clusters, but they also found the prospect of being isolated in the country daunting. So they have been looking for companionship at remote co-living spaces, where tenants rent furnished rooms in big, shared homes.<br />These former vacation homes, farms or converted hotels offer a shared office space and a place to sleep for those who want temporary accommodation.<br />European millennials have been at the forefront of this trend. Coconat—short for community and concentrated work in nature—is in a village outside Berlin. The 5-acre property, based in a converted manor, includes shared offices, a sauna, a swimming pond, a yoga studio and 20 rooms for guests who get three meals a day and pay less rent than for a Berlin apartment.<br />“Every room is taken, and it’s surprising,” said co-founder Julianne Becker. “The people really want to get out of the cities.”"
