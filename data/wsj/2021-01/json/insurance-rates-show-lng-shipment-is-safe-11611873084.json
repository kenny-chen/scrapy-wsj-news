    "body": "Regarding Mark A. Izeman’s Jan. 22 letter in support of blocking the proposed New Jersey liquefied natural gas (LNG) port: His argument falls flat in terms of the true risks of LNG. LNG in its liquid state is nontoxic, noncorrosive, nonflammable and isn’t explosive. His claim that LNG is “potentially explosive” is a stretch, at best. Only when the vapors of LNG are ignited in a closed space does it become flammable. Marine cargo insurance for LNG shipments are approximately 25% less than that of crude oil, due to the lower risk profile. Over the past 50 years, over 100,000 LNG shipments have been made globally, without any major safety incidents reported.<br />From an environmental standpoint, Mr. Izeman’s argument about the impact on water pollution simply doesn’t hold water (no pun intended). When LNG spills onto a land or water surface, it vaporizes, disperses and leaves no residue.<br />It’s no surprise that the Natural Resources Defense Council would be opposed to any form of fossil fuel, but claiming that LNG poses an unreasonable safety risk is wrong—nothing could be further from the truth.<br />Prof. Jon Sorensen (logistics)<br />Lone Star College"
