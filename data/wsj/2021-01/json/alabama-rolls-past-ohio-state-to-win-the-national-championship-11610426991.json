    "body": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla.—Long before top-ranked Alabama landed in Miami for the 2021 College Football Playoff Championship, Ohio State knew exactly what its opponent’s preferred offensive scheme would look like: a Mac Jones pass completed to receiver DeVonta Smith.<br />The Buckeyes may not have imagined the repetitive stress that would come from watching the Heisman Trophy winner, Smith, catch one pass after another from a Heisman Trophy finalist, Jones.<br />Smith and Jones may be the most unmemorable name ever for an electrifying college football duo, but the two connected for an unforgettable 12 completions, 215 yards and three touchdowns as Alabama dismantled Ohio State 52-24 before 14,926 socially distanced fans at Hard Rock Stadium to win its fifth national title in the past decade.<br />Ohio State wasn’t alone in being wowed by Smith’s dazzling performance. “DeVonta Smith is one of the best pure receivers I’ve ever watched!” LeBron James tweeted, while Patrick Mahomes joked that the Ohio State defense should “put everybody” on him.<br />Smith was named the game’s most valuable player despite missing most of the second half after leaving the game early in the third quarter with an apparent finger injury sustained after colliding with Ohio State linebacker Pete Warner."
