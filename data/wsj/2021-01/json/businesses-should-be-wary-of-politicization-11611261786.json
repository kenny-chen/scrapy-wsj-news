    "body": "Kimberley Strassel’s “Big Business’s Sharp Left Turn” (Potomac Watch, Jan. 15) reminds me of my youth in Maryland where the local lunch counters had signs saying: “We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.” In the time of Jim Crow laws, everyone knew what that meant: unless you were white, you would not receive service at the lunch counter. The argument was that “this is a private business, so we can set our own rules.” The courts finally said something to the effect of, yes, it is a private business, but the doors are open to the general public, therefore you cannot refuse service to any customer because of race. As a result, the lunch counters and other public businesses were integrated.<br />Sadly, those signs have returned, although not targeting nonwhites at lunch counters, but instead targeting conservatives on social-media platforms, etc. Apparently, conservatives are now being considered an undesirable class of citizens.<br />As the courts threw out double standards of service for whites versus nonwhites by public, but privately owned, businesses, perhaps there is a legal remedy for the double standard against conservative speech.<br />Michael R.
