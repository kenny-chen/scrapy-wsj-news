    "body": "New York Police Department officers used excessive force in response to a Black Lives Matter demonstration honoring Martin Luther King Jr., New York state Attorney General Letitia James said Tuesday.<br />Officers on Monday night arrested 29 protesters at the demonstration outside City Hall in lower Manhattan, NYPD officials said. The charges included disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, the officials said.<br />The protest, which drew hundreds of participants, began outside the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn and moved over the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan, where officers clashed with demonstrators at City Hall Park. Eleven officers suffered minor injuries in the incident, according to the officials, including a captain who was struck by a bottle.<br />Ms. James, who last week filed a lawsuit against the NYPD over its response to Black Lives Matter protests in New York City last year, said Tuesday that videos circulating on social media showed that officers acted too aggressively.<br />“Once again, we are seeing and hearing accounts of NYPD officers infringing on the rights of New Yorkers,” Ms. James said. “The images of officers using excessive force against peaceful protesters is alarming and cause for deep concern.”"
