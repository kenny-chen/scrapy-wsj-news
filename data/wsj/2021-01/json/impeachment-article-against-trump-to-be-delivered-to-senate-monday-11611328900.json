    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said she would send the article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump to the Senate on Monday, triggering a second impeachment trial, but with no agreement yet between Republicans and Democrats on the details of the proceedings.<br />The House voted last week to impeach Mr. Trump, alleging he incited a mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The violent events that day left five people dead.<br />The Democratic impeachment managers are “ready to begin to make their case to 100 Senate jurors through the trial process,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a brief statement Friday. The nine managers, who act as prosecutors in the case, will be led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) gave no guidance on how long the trial would last or whether the Senate could conduct other business as the trial is proceeding.<br />“It will be a full trial, it will be a fair trial,” he said Friday on the Senate floor."
