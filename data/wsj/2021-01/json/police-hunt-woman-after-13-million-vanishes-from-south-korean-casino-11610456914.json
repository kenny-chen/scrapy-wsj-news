In a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, executive director Wong Hoi Po said Landing hadn’t been able to reach the woman.<br />Shares in Landing International Development fell 7.6% to hit a record low on Monday, before recovering 4.7% on Tuesday.<br />South Korea’s semiofficial Yonhap News Agency reported that police in Jeju have retrieved security camera footage from the casino, but found that footage taken at around the time of the suspected heist had been erased."
