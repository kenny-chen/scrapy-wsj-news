    "body": "“Wonder Woman 1984” gave the new HBO Max streaming service a much-needed boost, according to data from Nielsen.<br />The movie, which made its theatrical and streaming debut simultaneously on Christmas Day, was the most watched content on all streaming platforms for the week of December 21 through December 27, the ratings-measurement firm said.<br />According to Nielsen data, “Wonder Woman 1984” had nearly 2.3 billion minutes viewed in its first three days on WarnerMedia’s HBO Max. That topped second-place “Soul,” the new Pixar movie on  Walt Disney Co.  ’s Disney+, which had 1.7 billion minutes viewed. While minutes viewed for “Wonder Woman 1984” was 35% higher, its run time is 155 minutes and “Soul,” has a run time of only 107 minutes.<br />This is the second time Nielsen issued streaming ratings for the week of Christmas. Last week, Nielsen had reported that “Soul” was the most-watched content. HBO Max then gave Nielsen permission to share its data for the first time since the service was launched in May, leading Nielsen to reissue the numbers with “Wonder Woman 1984” on top.<br />While WarnerMedia hasn’t released any data on how “Wonder Woman 1984” has performed, HBO Max did add nearly five million activations of the service in December to bring its total to 17 million."
