    "body": "The number of workers seeking unemployment benefits dropped last week, indicating a recent easing in the pace of layoffs though the labor market remains mired in a winter slowdown.<br />New jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, declined to 847,000 in the week ended Jan. 23, down from a revised 914,000 the week before.<br />The weekly tallies have remained for months well above the pre-pandemic peak of 695,000 and are higher than in any previous recession for records tracing back to 1967.<br />“The virus is in the driver’s seat—there’s no getting around it,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist and data scientist at Glassdoor, a company-ratings and job-listings website. “Until we control the pandemic, we can’t hope for a full recovery economically.”<br />Weekly jobless claims are volatile but have generally trended higher since November, when they were below 800,000, to 926,000 during the week of Jan. 9. They point to a slowing economic recovery, as surging coronavirus case numbers, fresh safety restrictions and colder weather hamper the labor market’s recovery from the initial shock of the pandemic last spring. Employers cut 140,000 jobs nationwide in December, with gains in many industries more than offset by losses at restaurants, bars, hotels and other businesses related to leisure and tourism."
