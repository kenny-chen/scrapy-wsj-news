    "body": "The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose above 1% for the first time since March, after returns from Georgia’s closely watched runoff elections fueled bets that Democrats could win narrow control of the Senate.<br />By late morning in Europe on Wednesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 1.033%, according to Tradeweb, up from 0.955% at its 3 p.m. ET close on Tuesday.<br />Democrat Raphael Warnock defeated incumbent Kelly Loeffler in one of the Georgia runoffs, according to the Associated Press, while a second race remained too close to call.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, started climbing on Tuesday evening as early returns from the elections started trickling in, showing extremely tight races but better-than-expected results for the Democratic candidates.<br />Wins in both races would effectively give Democrats 51 votes in the Senate, when counting the tiebreaking vote of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris—an outcome that many investors think would herald greater spending on pandemic-relief efforts and other Democratic priorities such as infrastructure projects."
