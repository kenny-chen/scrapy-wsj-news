    "body": "Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R., Pa.) calls Vice President Mike Pence   the “indispensable leader America needed” last week for Mr. Pence’s refusal to attempt to override the certified results of the 2020 election. This week Mr. Pence is proving himself indispensable again as he refuses to attempt to make himself president via the 25th Amendment.<br />The Journal’s Kristina Peterson, Natalie Andrews and Rebecca Ballhaus report:<br />Mr. Pence’s wise refusal to attempt to seize power is explained in a Tuesday letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.). Mr. Pence writes:<br />He’s right about that. As for his actions last week, Mr. Santorum writes in a Journal op-ed of Mr. Pence:<br />Today the House is likely to impeach Mr. Trump again, but not for his false claim that Mr. Pence had the authority to reject electors. The charge from Democrats and some Republicans is that Mr. Trump incited violence though this won’t be an easy case to prove if Mr. Trump is permitted to mount a defense."
