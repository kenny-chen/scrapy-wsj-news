    "body": "LONDON—Iran sanctioned President Trump and nine other U.S. officials, in a parting shot against an outgoing administration that has pummeled the country and its top officials with sanctions.<br />Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that the U.S. officials were designated for their role in terrorist activities against Iran, including sanctions and last year’s killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Iraq.<br />The Iranian sanctions also targeted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former and current special representatives for Iran Brian Hook and Elliott Abrams, as well as former national security adviser John Bolton.<br />“This is a transparently political stunt by the Iranian government that does not deserve the seriousness of a substantive response,” a State Department spokeswoman said.<br />The Iranian sanctions will have limited impact as the targeted U.S. officials have no known commercial links to Iran. Yet the move shows Tehran’s desire for a last-minute public relations blow to Mr. Trump, who leaves office Wednesday."
