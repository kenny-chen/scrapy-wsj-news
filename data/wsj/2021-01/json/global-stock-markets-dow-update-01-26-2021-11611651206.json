    "body": "U.S. stock futures were little changed after major indexes hit records a day earlier and investors got ready for a slew of blue-chip earnings.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 wavered between gains and losses, indicating the benchmark gauge may open flat after notching a record high Monday. Futures for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index fell 0.1% and contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.2% higher.<br />This week marks the height of earnings season, with shares of  General Electric  rallying 9.2% premarket after the industrial conglomerate reported forecast-beating fourth-quarter revenue and free cash flow.<br />Johnson & Johnson  rose 1.8% in premarket trade after it recorded stronger sales in its latest quarter, as revenue gains from its pharmaceutical division boosted its top-line results.  Raytheon Technologies  rose 2.5% after the aerospace and defense company reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations.<br />Starbucks ,   Microsoft  and  Texas Instruments  will release results after markets close. Major tech firms, including  Apple ,  Tesla and  Facebook ,  will update investors Wednesday."
