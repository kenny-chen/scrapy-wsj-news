    "body": "Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized deployment of the state National Guard ahead of an expected decision on whether to charge a Kenosha police officer in the shooting of Jacob Blake.<br />The Democratic governor said in a press release that 500 troops were activated this week at the request of local authorities.<br />Kenosha faced several weeks of civil disorder and extensive property damage after Mr. Blake was shot multiple times in the back by a police officer as Mr. Blake attempted to get in his car on Aug. 23.  Police had been called by a woman who said her boyfriend was on the premises and wasn’t supposed to be. Police made several attempts to detain Mr. Blake, a Black man who was wanted under a felony warrant.<br />A bystander video captured officers yelling for Mr. Blake to drop a knife, which was later found on the floorboards of his car. Mr. Blake was left paralyzed by the shooting.<br />Amid the unrest, then-17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was charged with homicide and other offenses after shooting three protestors demonstrating against the treatment of Mr. Blake, leaving two dead. Mr. Rittenhouse faces an arraignment hearing on Tuesday."
