    "body": "When five members of the Cleveland Browns tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week, it meant the team had to close its facility and prepare for a playoff game without its head coach and a star offensive lineman, among others.<br />It also meant the Pittsburgh Steelers were on the other side of a virus disruption that had nothing to do with them. Again.<br />The Browns and Steelers are still scheduled to play Sunday night in the wild-card round of the playoffs in a matchup that features one team that has been upended by the virus against another team that has seen its season jolted by outbreaks on opposing teams.<br />Cleveland wasn’t even able to gather players in person all week until late Friday afternoon because of the cases inside the club. Pittsburgh, which has been on the other side of the NFL’s two biggest outbreaks this season, is all too familiar with the potential consequences of these situations.<br />The NFL got through its 256 regular season games in its normal 17 weeks even if nothing was normal about this pandemic season. Stadiums were empty or partially filled, facilities were frequently closed because of positive tests and games were rescheduled, resulting in NFL action on each of the seven days of the week over the course of the year."
