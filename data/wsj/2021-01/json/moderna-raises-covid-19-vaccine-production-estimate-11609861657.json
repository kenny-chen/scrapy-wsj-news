    "body": "Moderna Inc. said it will be able to make at least 600 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine this year, 100 million more than it had been projecting.<br />The Cambridge, Mass., company also said it is making investments and adding staff to make as much as one billion doses this year.<br />Last month, Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine became the second to be authorized for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration, after a shot from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE was cleared.<br />Both vaccines use a new, gene-based technology requiring special manufacturing equipment and expertise. The companies have been racing to build capacity, often with the help of partners like Lonza Ltd., to meet heavy demand.<br />“Our effectiveness in providing early supply to the U.S. and Canadian governments and our ability to increase baseline production estimates for 2021 are both signals that our scale up of mRNA vaccine production is a success,” said Juan Andres, Moderna’s head of technical operations."
