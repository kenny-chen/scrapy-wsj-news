    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate confirmed President Biden’s pick to lead the sprawling U.S. intelligence community Wednesday, delivering the newly inaugurated president his first Senate-confirmed cabinet secretary.<br />Avril Haines is the first woman to become director of national intelligence, a job that oversees 18 intelligence agencies and units, including the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, which employ hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors.<br />The Senate voted 84-10 to confirm Ms. Haines, with only Republicans opposing her nomination.<br />Mr. Biden’s aides have said it is imperative for the new president to have his national security team in place as soon as possible to address pressing threats ranging from domestic extremist violence of the kind that was on display during the storming of the U.S. Capitol two weeks ago to a suspected Russian hack of huge swaths of the federal government. The Senate is expected to act in the coming days on some of Mr. Biden’s other nominees.<br />“This position is of such critical importance to the country that is only appropriate that it will be the first nomination of the new Biden administration to be confirmed by the Senate,” said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the incoming Democratic leader of the Senate Intelligence Committee."
