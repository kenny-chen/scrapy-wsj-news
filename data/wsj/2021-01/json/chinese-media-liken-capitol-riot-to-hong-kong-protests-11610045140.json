    "body": "Chinese and Russian state media criticized the U.S. following the storming of Congress, calling out what they described as hypocrisy from a country whose leaders have long denounced Moscow and Beijing for undermining democratic values.<br />In pointed coverage from both countries, Chinese reports drew parallels between the scene at the Capitol and protests in Hong Kong, while Russian state-controlled outlets gloated over Wednesday’s chaos in Washington.<br />Chinese media compared Wednesday’s events and the 2019 attempt by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong to charge into the legislature, demanding the right to hold free and fair elections. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that year described the pro-democracy demonstrations then rocking the Chinese territory as “a beautiful sight to behold.”<br />In China, this phrase has become an official shorthand for a propaganda theme under the Chinese Communist Party that alleged falsehood and hypocrisy in American democracy, wrote David Bandurski, co-director of The University of Hong Kong’s China Media Project.<br />On Weibo, a Chinese social-media platform akin to  Twitter ,  the Chinese Communist Youth League captioned photos on Thursday depicting the violence and destruction in the U.S. Capitol with the same words."
