    "body": "Hospitals say the continued Covid-19 surge will require more relief than Congress included in the new pandemic-aid act after lawmakers scaled back health-care funding.<br />The sweeping bill included $3 billion for relief for hospitals, clinics and other health-care providers for revenue losses and higher expenses as a result of the pandemic, far less than the $35 billion previously proposed.<br />About $25 billion hasn’t been spent of the $175 billion health-care relief fund Congress created in the spring. Even so, funds won’t be enough to meet the strain of the latest nationwide surge, said Rick Pollack, the American Hospital Association’s chief executive. More than 125,000 Covid-19 patients were in U.S. hospitals as of Wednesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project, another national record.<br />“The surge in cases is ongoing,” said Tom Nickels, the association’s executive vice president, increasing hospitals’ financial strain from higher staffing and supply costs for Covid-19 patients and revenue losses, as other services are suspended. “We anticipate we will need additional funding.”<br />New limits on relief may also inadvertently disadvantage hospitals with patients most severely affected by the pandemic, health-policy experts said."
