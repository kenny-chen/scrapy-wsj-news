    "body": "The Kansas City Chiefs had a safe lead against the Cleveland Browns when the one thing that couldn’t happen to them did. They lost Patrick Mahomes.<br />Mahomes left with a concussion. The Chiefs nearly blew it. Then Chad Henne, Mahomes’s backup, pulled off a pair of improbable plays to seal a nutty 22-17 win and send Kansas City to the AFC Championship.<br />But before the Chiefs host the Buffalo Bills in that game for a spot in the Super Bowl, there’s one outstanding question: Will Mahomes be available to play?<br />The odds aren’t great. From 2015 to 2019, NFL quarterbacks were held out a median of seven days after suffering a concussion in a game, according to the league. The AFC Championship is exactly a week after Sunday’s game—meaning Mahomes would have to return earlier than normal to play.<br />It’s also not as simple as Mahomes saying he feels ready to play. It’s not in his hands. It’s not in the team’s hands, either."
