    "body": "ISLAMABAD—Pakistan’s top court acquitted the man convicted in 2002 of orchestrating the kidnapping and killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.<br />The Supreme Court dismissed on Thursday all charges against Omar Sheikh, a British citizen who has spent more than 18 years in prison in Pakistan for the crime.<br />The judges ordered that Mr. Sheikh be released from jail immediately, if not wanted in any other case. However, Pakistani authorities have  prevented Mr. Sheikh from walking free since a lower court ruled in April that he be released.<br />A lawyer for the government, Faiz Shah, said he was disappointed about Thursday’s outcome and said authorities would challenge the verdict. He said it remains to be seen whether Mr. Sheikh would remain in prison in the meantime.<br />The U.S. government has said it is willing to intervene in the case, but it isn’t clear how it could do so. Behind the scenes, U.S. officials say they have been pressing Pakistani authorities to keep Mr. Sheikh in prison. Pakistani ministers voiced concern last year about the prospect of Mr. Sheikh’s release."
