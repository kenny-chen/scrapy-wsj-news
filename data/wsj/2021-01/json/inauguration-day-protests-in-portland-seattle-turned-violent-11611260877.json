    "body": "Police in Portland and Seattle arrested more than a dozen protesters for allegedly vandalizing immigration offices and other buildings Wednesday during Inauguration Day demonstrations in both cities.<br />The arrests came as law enforcement agencies across the country were on high alert following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, and amid lingering fears that large groups of armed protesters might mobilize around state capitols.<br />Officials in Portland declined to characterize the apparent political motivations of the protesters Wednesday.<br />The protests in both cities appeared to share some of the anti-law-enforcement sentiments expressed in largely left-wing protests that unfolded in both cities last summer, following the killing of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.<br />Police in Seattle said a group of marchers dressed mostly in black set fire to a large American flag in an intersection not far from a federal immigration court. They also tore plywood coverings off windows that they then smashed, police said. Among the buildings damaged were the William Kenzo Nakamura federal courthouse and a  Starbucks  in the Pike Place Market."
