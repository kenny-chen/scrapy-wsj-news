    "body": "Regarding Andrew Wheeler’s “Why We’re Ending the EPA’s Reliance on Secret Science” (op-ed, Jan. 5): How odd that anyone would oppose transparency in science while at the same time claiming to be scientific.<br />Of course data and studies that support public policy should be public. Concern about the privacy of study participants sounds like a red herring. In sensitive legal or political documents, such information is either redacted or undisclosed from the start. Witness the many cases with parties named John Doe.<br />Public access to scientific research is even more important now when Big Pharma, Big Tech and political correctness dominate our professions and education system. The peer review that used to check scientific work is now often compromised by industry, money or ideology.<br />This rule is a good start. Science needs more transparency, not less.<br />Teresa R. Manning"
