Now, the U.K. hopes it is turning the tide, thanks to a homegrown vaccine that has yet to be authorized elsewhere in the West.<br />More than four million of the most at-risk people in the U.K., almost 8% of the adult population, have been vaccinated with at least one shot of vaccine.<br />Among them are more than half of the frailest group of all: the 300,000 elderly residents of nursing homes who can’t travel to get a shot. The key to reaching them has been mobile vaccination teams armed with a shot developed by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC.<br />Together with a network of family doctors and vaccination hubs in sports centers, hotels and cathedrals, this shot has helped the country to stay on track toward a target of vaccinating its 15 million most vulnerable people by mid-February.<br />The government says the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has also been authorized in India, Morocco and some countries in Latin America, has been a game changer in reaching people tucked away in smaller nursing homes."
