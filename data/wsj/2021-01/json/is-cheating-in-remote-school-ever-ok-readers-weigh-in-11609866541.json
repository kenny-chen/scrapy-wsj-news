    "body": "In a recent Wall Street Journal Family & Tech column, Julie Jargon looked at remote school and cheating. Online schooling has made certain kinds of cheating easier. In the difficult situations students face this year, should the normal rules apply? Readers weighed in. Here are edited excepts of their comments.<br />I am a high school teacher in Sarasota, Fla. While grading a unit test, I discovered an unusual pattern. About 25% of my remote Algebra 2 students were using a free app to solve math problems and a Snapchat group to cheat. Most have admitted it, but others have denied it.<br />I am still upset. As hard as I’m working to help them learn math, to be successful now and in the future, they outright cheat. I have asked remote students to show their workspace. Somehow, on test days, students seem to have technology issues that prevent them from doing this.<br />How do we stop this cheating? I could say, “Let them cheat.” They will suffer the consequences when they take the SAT, ACT, and future math classes. I could also say, “Let them learn Algebra 2 on their own from the book,” but this is not right. I just don’t have the answer to the cheating.<br />Beth Reuger"
