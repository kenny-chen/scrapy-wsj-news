    "body": "Rahm Emanuel seems sincere in his hope that President-elect Joe Biden will reassure the American people that their faith in public institutions is well placed (“Biden’s Win for the American System,” op-ed, Dec. 29). But he goes on to write “we should” several times, in each case stressing what government should do and glossing over what the people can do.<br />Mr. Emanuel might have advocated accepting personal responsibility for living lawfully, avoiding the drug culture, going to school and trying to learn what is being taught, fathers accepting responsibility for helping to raise their children, maybe even restoring the notion of a commitment to intact family life. How about stop rioting and seek a job? Take pride in achieving something of value.<br />Right before all those “shoulds” for government, Mr. Emanuel recites the famous John Kennedy line: “Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” I submit that the government can succeed when and if the people accept the responsibility to help themselves.<br />Robert H. Eidsvold<br />Fort Myers, Fla."
