    "body": "Here’s what we’re watching ahead of Friday’s opening bell.<br />—U.S. stock futures slipped, signaling a muted end to a strong week on Wall Street as investors awaited data on how the economy performed at the start of 2021.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 fell 0.7%, indicating that the benchmark gauge may open lower after megacap technology companies pushed it to its fourth record close of the new year on Thursday. Futures for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index lost 0.6% and contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.8%.<br />The SPAC attack continues. At least 10 blank-check companies, also known as special-purpose acquisition companies, debut trading Friday, according to IPOScoop.com. These include a $500 million SPAC sponsored by Greg Maffei of  Liberty Media  and a $360 million SPAC sponsored by  Primavera Capital ,  headed by former Goldman Sachs banker Fred Hu.<br />U.S. existing-home sales for December, due at 10 a.m. ET, are expected to fall to an annual pace of 6.55 million from 6.69 million a month earlier."
