    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden on Tuesday signed a series of executive orders that are intended to advance racial equity, including action to phase out the federal use of private prisons.<br />“The simple truth is, our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist,” Mr. Biden said in remarks at the White House. “It’s corrosive, it’s destructive and it’s costly.”<br />“We’re also less prosperous. We’re less successful. We’re less secure,” he added. “We must change.”<br />Mr. Biden signed a mandate directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development to examine housing policies that disproportionately affect people of color. And he took action to end the Justice Department’s use of private prisons in a return to an Obama-era policy.<br />Then-President Barack Obama’s Justice Department in 2016 said private prisons had more safety and security problems than those run by the U.S. government and moved to phase them out. Former President Donald Trump’s administration reversed that policy, saying the Federal Bureau of Prisons needed to be able to contract with private companies to meet its future needs."
