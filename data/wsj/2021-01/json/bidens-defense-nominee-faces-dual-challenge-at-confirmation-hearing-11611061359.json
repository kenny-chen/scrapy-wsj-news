    "body": "WASHINGTON—When Gen. Lloyd Austin appears before the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday, he will be one of the few members of President-elect Joe Biden’s team with deep military experience to help him confront threats around the world, his advisers said.<br />At the same time, the Army officer with 41 years of military service will have to persuade those same lawmakers he can lead the Pentagon with the perspective of a civilian.<br />The modern Defense Department was designed to have a civilian leader and a team of senior uniformed officers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advising the president. Because of that, the law requires Gen. Austin, who retired from the U.S. Army in 2016, to receive a waiver from Congress to hold the job of secretary of defense, in addition to winning the Senate confirmation required of most cabinet-level appointees.<br />“Lloyd is very cognizant that he is coming in as a political appointee,” said a person familiar with his preparations for the confirmation hearings. “He knows that he is going to be a civilian, politically appointed official in the Biden cabinet, and he’s comfortable taking on that new role. He has to make it clear he is not a general.”<br />Laws safeguarding civilian control of the military require the top Pentagon civilian job to be held by someone out of uniform for seven years, unless Congress votes to waive the rule. Gen. Austin, 67, would become the second recent Pentagon leader to require a congressional waiver, following retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, who was President Trump’s first defense secretary."
