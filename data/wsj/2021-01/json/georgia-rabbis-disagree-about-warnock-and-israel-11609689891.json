    "body": "Barton Swaim’s op-ed “What Warnock Believes About Israel” (Dec. 17): mentions the Jewish Democratic Council of America’s letter endorsing Georgia Democrat Raphael Warnock for U.S. Senate. A rival letter, signed by the rabbis who lead Georgia’s two largest Orthodox congregations, disagrees pointedly: “The fact that partisan clergy sign a letter does not, unfortunately, mean its words are true.”<br />“Rev. Warnock misused his pulpit to bear false witness,” they write. In sermonizing about his visit to Israel he claimed, “We saw the government of Israel shoot down unarmed Palestinian sisters and brothers like birds of prey.” According to this letter, “He saw no such thing, because it never happened. Each and every element of his statement was false, defamatory, and bigoted.” It continues, “Only a fool, or someone callously unconcerned for the safety of Israel and the Jewish community, would grant credence to what he says on the campaign trail today to Jewish audiences, over what he said just a year ago in front of his own, supportive congregation.”<br />Charles D. Eden<br />Atlanta"
