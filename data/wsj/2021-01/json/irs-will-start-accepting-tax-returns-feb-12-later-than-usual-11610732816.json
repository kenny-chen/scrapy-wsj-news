    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Internal Revenue Service won’t start accepting 2020 individual income tax returns until Feb. 12, several weeks later than usual, as the agency implements late tax legislation.<br />This tax season could be unusually challenging for the IRS and for taxpayers. The IRS said Friday that it needed time to program and test its computer systems after Congress passed a relief law in late December.<br />“Planning for the nation’s filing season process is a massive undertaking, and IRS teams have been working nonstop,” said IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig.<br />Millions of people who didn’t get the full stimulus payments from laws passed in March and December will be able to claim the money through their 2020 tax returns. That group includes people who had children during 2020 and those who didn’t qualify for the full payments based on 2019 income but saw income drop in 2020. Others will be surprised to learn that unemployment insurance benefits are taxable.<br />The Feb. 12 start date means that some tax refunds will hit bank accounts later than usual. That could slow consumer spending in February, though the $600 per-person stimulus payments that households have been receiving this month could offset that effect."
