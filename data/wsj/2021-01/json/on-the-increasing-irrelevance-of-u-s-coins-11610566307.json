    "body": "Stephen Moore’s “America Is Willing to Pay for Change” (op-ed, Dec. 30) on the American coin shortage only addresses part of the problem with coin circulation in our country. The real elephant in the room is the fact that no one carries coins around anymore because they have become essentially worthless. Our politicians are loath to admit that decades of inflation have made American coinage worth less than Monopoly money, so why would anyone bother to carry coins around in their daily lives? This is even more true today, when we have debit and credit cards, and smartphone pay apps.<br />The smallest euro note is five euros, and there are coins for one and two euros, as well as the usual cent denominations. We should do the same, with the possible exception of the elimination of the penny and the nickel.<br />Kurt Harris<br />Rockford, Ill.<br />"
