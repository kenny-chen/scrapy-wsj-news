    "body": "In addition to billions of taxpayer dollars awarded to favored corporations under the guise of investing in green energy, expect two major policy reversals from an Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm (“Biden’s Climate All Stars,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 28).<br />First, “environmental responsibility” will justify regulations that drive up the cost of shale oil-and-gas production, perhaps halting new production altogether. Second, mandates and incentives to use renewable energy will turn energy producers from profit makers into rent seekers, generating returns from government largesse. Increases in the legally required percentage of renewable energy in the electricity stream raise corporate profits in tandem with consumer energy costs.<br />This is what Ms. Granholm did as governor of Michigan. As energy secretary, her policies would slow energy production, drive costs up and increase government involvement in our lives—that’s the plan.<br />John Mularoni<br />Bloomfield Hills, Mich."
