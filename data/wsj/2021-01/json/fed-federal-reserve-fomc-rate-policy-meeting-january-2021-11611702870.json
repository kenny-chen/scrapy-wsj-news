    "body": "<br />Federal Reserve officials are likely to acknowledge recent signs of economic weakening but keep policy on hold at a meeting that concludes Wednesday, choosing to wait and see if business activity picks up.<br />The Fed has set short-term interest rates near zero, launched a bond-purchase program of $120 billion a month, and said it would keep stimulative measures in place until its goals of lower unemployment and 2% inflation are achieved.<br />Last month marked a setback, because the virus resurged and many states in response resumed business shutdowns. Employment and retail sales fell in December, and the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits has been rising since November.<br />However, Fed officials have said they believe the setback is temporary."
