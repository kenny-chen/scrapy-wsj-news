    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House said Thursday that it doesn’t plan to ask Congress to split its $1.9 trillion Covid-19 proposal into two pieces amid mounting opposition from Republicans and centrist Democrats who say the plan is too costly.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki wrote on  Twitter  that the “needs of the American people are urgent” on issues such as “putting food on the table,” vaccine distribution and reopening schools, and “we aren’t looking to split a package in two.”<br />Brian Deese, the White House director of the National Economic Council, and Jeff Zients, who is coordinating President Biden’s Covid-19 response, are expected to brief Senate Democrats later Thursday.<br />Mr. Biden told reporters Monday that “time is of the essence” but he was “reluctant to cherry pick and take out one or two items here and then have to go through it again. ... They go sort of hand-in-glove.”<br />Many Republicans and some Democrats have balked at the cost of the administration’s proposal and suggested there would be bipartisan support for a smaller package focused on vaccine distribution, potentially a third round of direct checks and some other measures."
