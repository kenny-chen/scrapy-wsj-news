    "body": "In an effort to get more children out of living rooms and into classrooms, President Biden and state lawmakers have begun pushing financial incentives—as well as threats to cut funding—to get school districts to swing their doors open.<br />While the approaches vary, final decisions on in-person learning often rest with school boards and local leaders, not federal and state officials.<br />Mr. Biden has vowed to reopen kindergarten through eighth grade classrooms in his first 100 days with a proposed $130 billion in federal funding for safety measures. California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed $2 billion for districts offering some in-person instruction. Lawmakers in states such as Utah and Tennessee have proposed bills that could result in funding cuts to districts not offering in-person instruction.<br />This week, a new study from researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who examined rural districts in Wisconsin found coronavirus spread was limited in schools that use mitigation strategies such as mask-wearing and social distancing.<br />“The money is a bargaining chip in two ways,” said Marguerite Roza, director of the Edunomics Lab at Georgetown University. More funding could address concerns school staff have about safety in classrooms, while threats to pull funding could hasten a return, she said."
