    "body": "President Biden is proposing that the New START treaty be extended for five years, a step that would maintain the basic arms control framework that has constrained the American and Russian long-range nuclear arsenals, according to people familiar with the decision.<br />Mr. Biden said during the campaign that he wanted to extend the accord, which is scheduled to lapse on Feb. 5, but hadnâ€™t said how long he wanted to retain the agreement.<br />Russia has long sought to prolong the treaty, which can be extended for up to five years by mutual consent. The extension is likely to be agreed upon quickly despite friction between Washington and Moscow, current and former officials said.<br />A five-year extension would provide a measure of predictability to the U.S. and Russian military competition and has been urged by pro-arms control groups. In addition to limiting long-range nuclear arms, the accord provides for weapons inspections and monitoring.<br />With the demise of the U.S.-Russian treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear forces, New START is the last major building block in the legal regime that regulates the nuclear competition between the U.S. and Russia."
