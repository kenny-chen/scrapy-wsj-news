    "body": "WASHINGTON—A Senate panel voted Friday to approve Janet Yellen’s nomination to be the next U.S. Treasury secretary, sending it to the full Senate, which could vote to confirm her as soon as Friday.<br />The Senate Finance Committee approved Ms. Yellen’s confirmation unanimously, suggesting the former Federal Reserve chairwoman will garner strong support.<br />Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said he hoped the GOP support for Ms. Yellen “signals an interest by me and I know by all of my Republican colleagues in working cooperatively and in a bipartisan way.”<br />While several Republicans said they disagreed with Ms. Yellen on policy issues, including on tax increases and proposals to raise the minimum wage, they said she was qualified to lead the Treasury and hoped she would continue to work with Republicans in Congress.<br />If confirmed, Ms. Yellen would become the first woman to be the U.S. Treasury secretary, and the first person to lead the Treasury, Fed and the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which she chaired during the Clinton administration."
