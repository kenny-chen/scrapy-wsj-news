    "body": "WASHINGTON—Upon being sworn in as vice president Wednesday, Kamala Harris will have to balance multiple roles: as a counselor to President-elect Joe Biden, the Senate tiebreaker and the potential standard-bearer for the Democratic Party whose current leaders are in their 70s or 80s.<br />Ms. Harris, who will be the first woman and first Black vice president, will begin her tenure with a broad but undefined portfolio of responsibilities, according to her aides. Both she and Mr. Biden have said she would be a full partner, sharing her opinions on every decision and taking on tasks he won’t have time to manage, as the sharply divided country copes with a pandemic and a still-recovering economy.<br />“There’s not a single decision I’ve made yet about personnel or about how to proceed that I haven’t discussed it with Kamala first,” Mr. Biden said last month.<br />While Mr. Biden, 78, is in good health, he will be the oldest president to be sworn into office, putting the role of Ms. Harris, 56, as next in the line of succession and as a party leader into greater focus. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, is 70, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, is 80.<br />Ms. Harris’s challenge—as is the case for every vice president—will be to help Mr. Biden’s agenda without contradicting or overshadowing him."
