    "body": "Home-price growth accelerated in November, as buyers continued to compete for a limited number of homes on the market.<br />The S&P  CoreLogic  Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 9.5% in the year that ended in November, up from an 8.4% annual rate the prior month. November marked the highest annual rate of price growth since February 2014.<br />Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose in 2020 to their highest annual level since 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors. Record-low mortgage rates have increased demand, while the supply of homes for sale has remained low, especially at affordable price points.<br />The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 8.8% over the year ended in November, compared with a 7.6% increase in October. The 20-city index rose 9.1%, after an annual gain of 8% in October.<br />“The housing market continued to hold stronger than expected throughout the last months of 2020,” said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic. “Homebuyers will continue to compete for fewer and fewer homes available for sale, which will drive home prices higher.”"
