    "body": "Justice Department officials are weighing an amnesty program under which U.S. academics could disclose past foreign funding without fear of punishment for their disclosures, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />High-level officials, including Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers, have discussed the program in recent months, and circulated a draft proposal for it, these people said.<br />Consideration of the program comes as the U.S. government continues to grapple with how to support international academic collaboration while making sure professors disclose foreign sources of funding. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department tried to target what it says are potentially inappropriate efforts by China to gain access to cutting-edge U.S. scientific research being funded by U.S. taxpayers.<br />Federal prosecutors have brought more than a dozen criminal cases since mid-2019 accusing academics of lying about receiving Chinese government funding or alleging that visiting researchers lied about their affiliation with the Chinese military, some of which have resulted in guilty pleas.<br />The program being discussed could allow investigators to ascertain the scope of foreign money funding U.S. research, and help FBI agents focus on the people they believed posed the greatest national security threats, the people said. But the plan hasnâ€™t yet been implemented, and some prosecutors are concerned that it could undercut existing cases, the people said. Mr. Demers declined to comment."
