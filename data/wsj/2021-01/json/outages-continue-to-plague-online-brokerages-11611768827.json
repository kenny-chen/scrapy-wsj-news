    "body": "Outages and interruptions rattled investors using some of the largest online brokers on Wednesday.<br />Charles Schwab Corp., Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments and several other online brokerages reported service disruptions, either to clients directly or on their social-media accounts. The new technical issues come after brokerage customers already encountered brief delays executing trades this week or temporarily lost access to vital account information.<br />The service disruptions have come during a period of frenetic trading, with shares of companies such as  GameStop Corp.  shooting wildly higher. The volatility has been largely driven by individual investors and unmoored to the fundamentals of the underlying companies. The rising prices have prompted bearish investors to buy back shares they had sold short to cut their losses, pushing the stock higher still.<br />None of the brokerages commented on the reason for the issues.<br />On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade told customers that the firm was blocking some trades on GameStop,  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  and certain securities."
