    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday ordered the dismissal of litigation alleging Donald Trump had been illegally profiting from his presidency, saying the matter was now moot.<br />The justices in brief written orders wiped out a pair of cases alleging Mr. Trump was violating the Constitution’s emoluments clauses, which prohibit the president from receiving things of value from foreign and state governments.<br />The plaintiffs alleged Mr. Trump improperly used the presidency as a platform to promote his businesses.<br />Mr. Trump while in office turned over the operation of his businesses to his sons, but he retained his personal ownership stake. His personal lawyers argued the cases were a form of presidential harassment.<br />One lawsuit, filed by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, alleged the Trump International Hotel and related operations in the nation’s capital enjoyed an unfair advantage over competing businesses in the region because foreign-government entities and other customers sought to use Trump-owned properties to ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration."
