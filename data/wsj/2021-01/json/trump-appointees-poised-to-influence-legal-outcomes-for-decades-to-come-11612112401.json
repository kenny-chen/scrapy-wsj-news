    "body": "<br />The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has a longstanding reputation for liberalism, but some of its recent rulings have been cheered by conservatives.<br />The San Francisco-based court, home to 29 active judges, has invalidated a California gun law banning magazines that can hold 10 or more bullets, upheld Trump administration immigration rules that denied visas to people unlikely to obtain health insurance and allowed regulations forbidding federal family-planning grants to health clinics that provide abortions.<br />Judges appointed by former President Donald Trump were in the majority in each decision.<br />In New Orleans, the 17-member Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was already considered one of the nation’s most conservative appeals courts before an influx of Trump appointees. The new members have been involved in rulings that cast a cloud over the Affordable Care Act and gave Texas room to limit abortions as well as drop-off locations for absentee ballots during the pandemic. They have also embraced stronger protections for gun ownership and the exercise of religion."
