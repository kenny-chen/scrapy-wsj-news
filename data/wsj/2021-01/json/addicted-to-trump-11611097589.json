    "body": "Donald Trump’s Presidency ends on Wednesday at noon, as the Constitution stipulates. One question to ponder is who will miss him more—his friends or his foes?<br />Our guess is the latter. And if you doubt it, consider the chat between Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton Monday on Mrs. Clinton’s “You and Me Both” podcast. They’re addicted to the man.<br />“I would love to see [Mr. Trump’s] phone records to see whether he was talking to Putin the day that the insurgents invaded our Capitol,” Mrs. Clinton said. The former first lady, who has never accepted the results of the 2016 election, is immune to the irony that in claiming he really won the election President Trump is following her pre-election advice to Joe Biden to “not concede under any circumstance.”<br />Mrs. Pelosi said during the podcast that she once told Mr. Trump that “with you, Mr. President, all roads lead to Putin.” She added that the Capitol rioters “were doing Putin’s business when they did that at the incitement of an insurrection by the President of the United States.” When Mrs. Clinton asked whether the country needs “a 9/11-type commission to investigate and report everything that they can pull together,” Mrs. Pelosi responded “I do.” Though she says she doesn’t know what it is, she suggested Mr. Putin must have something on him “politically, financially or personally.”<br />Maybe they should have a special counsel spend years investigating Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. Wait, they already did that."
