    "body": "Hesitancy on the part of long-term-care-facility staffers to receive Covid-19 vaccinations is slowing the rollout of the shots to the nation’s nursing homes and assisted-living centers,  CVS Health Corp.  said Wednesday.<br />Another factor driving lower-than-anticipated rollout numbers: Initial estimates by the facilities overstated the number of people living in them by about 20% to 30%, CVS said. During the pandemic, families have been reluctant to send relatives to nursing homes, which have been linked to more than 115,000 deaths.<br />“Based on feedback from our field teams, we’ve encountered more vaccine hesitancy among staff when compared with residents,” a CVS spokesman said. Facilities are also staggering dosing to staff because of potential side effects, which has extended the process.<br />The pharmacy giant said it is still on track to reach federal goals to deliver first doses at about 8,000 skilled-nursing facilities by Jan. 25.  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  said Wednesday that it also expects to complete the administration of the first doses in skilled-nursing facilities by Jan. 25.<br />CVS and Walgreens said they are also preparing to provide vaccinations to the general public by appointment at their drugstores once they become available for mass distribution later this year. Currently CVS and Walgreens are only authorized to administer vaccines at long-term-care facilities under a federal contract."
