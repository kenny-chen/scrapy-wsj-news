    "body": "<br /><br /><br />As everybody with even the slightest interest in the arts knows, the coming of Covid-19 has had a catastrophic effect on creative institutions in every part of America. According to Americans for the Arts, a Washington-based advocacy group, one out of every 10 nonprofit arts organizations in the U.S. reports that they “doubt their ability” to survive the pandemic. And according to the latest survey reported by the same organization, 63% of “artists/creatives” are “fully unemployed” and 95% report “loss of income.”<br />Yes, there is real hope in the new coronavirus vaccines: Dr. Anthony Fauci recently said that if the vaccination program is successful, he believes it will be possible for theaters to reopen with relatively few restrictions in the fall. But there’s still a very long way to go before stage actors and other freelance artists, jazz and pop musicians in particular—not to mention those in associated professions like set design, lighting technology and sound mixing—can start to earn a living again. And that’s just one corner of the arts ecosystem: Museums and galleries, for example, are in similarly dire straits, as well as symphony orchestras, opera companies and dance troupes."
