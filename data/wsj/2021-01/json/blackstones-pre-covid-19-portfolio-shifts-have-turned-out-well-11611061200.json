    "body": "The pandemic has slammed some of the major property types, but changes that  Blackstone  Group Inc. made to its real-estate portfolio over time have helped the investment firm navigate through the fallout.<br />In the years before Covid-19 hit, Blackstone altered its property mix based on changes taking place in the economy and technologies. While investors at the firm weren’t preparing for a pandemic, their moves to gradually reduce exposure to certain real-estate categories have since served them well.<br />Retail and lodging, for example, have been the two hardest-hit commercial-property types during the pandemic, as travel nosedived and consumers migrated to online shopping with many stores closed or limiting capacity because of Covid-19.<br />In a global real-estate portfolio that Blackstone values at $341 billion, retail real-estate holdings make up only 5% of equity value, down from 19% in 2015, according to the firm. Changes in equity value result both from firm investment decisions and changes in market valuations.<br />Hotels account for 7% of the equity value, down from 23% in 2015. Lodging was nearly half the portfolio’s equity value in 2010, when Blackstone controlled  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.  and owned many lodging properties."
