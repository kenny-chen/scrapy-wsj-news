    "body": "Triumph turned to fury this week when individual investors were shut out of the week’s hottest trades.<br />Hordes of individuals blasted Robinhood Markets Inc., pledging to cancel their accounts with the brokerage. Reddit users urged their peers to “hold the line” on hot stocks that had begun to tumble Thursday. The fury even reached Capitol Hill.<br />It was a marked departure from a day earlier, when the same investors were claiming victory over Wall Street.<br />“WE WILL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT,” said one post on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, which got more than 24,000 votes of approval. “This reeks of corruption,” said another, from Daniel Carson, a 49-year-old facility manager in Minneapolis and a WallStreetBets follower.<br />Mr. Carson, who owns thousands of shares of  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,  said he had been planning to use profits from day trading to help pay off a house and pad up college savings accounts."
