    "body": "Citigroup Inc.  on Friday said its fourth-quarter income fell 7% and it drew down some of the reserves it set aside to cover potentially soured loans.<br />The New York bank said profit fell to $4.63 billion, or $2.08 per share, compared with $4.98 billion, or $2.15 per share, a year earlier. Still, that beat the $1.34 expected by analysts polled by FactSet.<br />Revenue fell 10% to $16.5 billion, falling short of the $16.72 billion analysts expected.<br />For all of 2020, a year of upheaval in the economy, profit at the nation’s third-biggest bank by assets fell 41% to $11.37 billion and revenue was flat at $74.3 billion. Like its big bank peers, Citigroup enjoyed strong results from its Wall Street operations, but that was offset by the billions of dollars the bank had to put aside for potentially bad loans.<br />In a sign its outlook on the economy has improved, Citigroup drew down $1.5 billion of the reserves the bank had put aside for future loan losses, a big reason the bank’s profit was better than expected."
