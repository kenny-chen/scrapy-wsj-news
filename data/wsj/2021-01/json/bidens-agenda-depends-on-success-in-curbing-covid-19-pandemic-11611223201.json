    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s success in achieving some of his biggest policy objectives—curbing climate change, expanding health coverage and overhauling immigration laws—will depend in large part on his success in combating the coronavirus pandemic, which he sought to jump-start Thursday with a national road map and a series of executive orders.<br />Health experts both inside and outside the new administration agree that while accelerating vaccinations will help restore normalcy and spur momentum for Mr. Biden’s broader political agenda, the opposite is also true: Failing to slow the spread of Covid-19 could also overshadow his presidency.<br />“Dealing with Covid and the economic recovery is the thing that will make the presidency in the next two years and into the 2022 election,” said Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University.<br />“If it doesn’t get better,” said Mr. Blendon, “people are going to hold the administration accountable.”<br />Mr. Biden’s national strategy announced Thursday is part of a blizzard of activity to curb the virus in his first 100 days, including a federal mask mandate, the administration of 100 million vaccines, the establishment of 100 federally supported vaccination centers, and reopening of most kindergarten-through-eighth-grade schools."
