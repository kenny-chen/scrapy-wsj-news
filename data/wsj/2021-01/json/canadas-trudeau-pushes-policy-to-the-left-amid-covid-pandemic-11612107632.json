    "body": "OTTAWA—Amid the pandemic, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is betting his political future on a shift further to the left.<br />Before the global public-health crisis, Mr. Trudeau positioned himself as a progressive, with an emphasis on promoting gender equality, combating racism, and fighting climate change. He ran some deficits to support infrastructure projects.<br />Now he’s shifting his agenda into a higher gear, marking one of the biggest leftward moves in Canadian federal politics since the mid-1960s, political analysts and historians say, when the Liberal government of the day introduced universal health care and a national pension plan.<br />“We can choose to embrace bold new solutions to the challenges we face and refuse to be held back by old ways of thinking,” Mr. Trudeau said back in August, when he first began making promises about a wider social safety net and more aggressive environmental policy. “This is our chance to build a more resilient Canada.”<br />He appointed a new finance minister, Chrystia Freeland—who steered Canada’s negotiations with the Trump administration on a revamped North American free-trade pact—to oversee development of this new policy road map."
