    "body": "General Motors Co.  has set a 2035 target date for phasing out gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles from its showrooms globally, among the first major auto makers to put a timeline on transitioning to a fully electric lineup.<br />GM’s goal, disclosed in a social-media post Thursday from Chief Executive Mary Barra, would mark a striking transition from its current business model. Vehicles that run on fossil fuels and emit pollution account for roughly 98% of GM’s sales today and all of its profit. The large pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles that are the company’s biggest money makers are also among its least fuel-efficient vehicles.<br />The nation’s largest auto maker by sales called the 2035 date to eliminate all tailpipe pollution an aspiration. Even so, many governments around the world, from California to Japan and the U.K., have pledged to ban gas- and diesel-powered cars by then.<br />GM previously had said it expects its own portfolio and the broader car market to go all-electric eventually, but company executives hadn’t discussed a time frame.<br />GM executives said Thursday that the goal of going all-electric within 15 years hinges partly on government incentives and other support to nudge consumers toward plug-in cars. The federal government and many states offer tax credits to buyers to help offset the higher cost of plug-in cars."
