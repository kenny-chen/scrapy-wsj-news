    "body": "Oil prices fell Friday, dragged lower by growing worries that the pandemic will spur greater restrictions on travel and economic activity.<br />U.S. crude prices dropped 1.6% to $52.27 a barrel, ending lower for a  second consecutive session. Oil has stayed in a tight trading range recently as investors weigh worries about crumbling consumption against large supply reductions.<br />Prices have increased steadily since the beginning of the year, with the U.S. benchmark passing $50 a barrel last month for the first time since early last year. That was when a production fight between major producers flooded global markets just as the pandemicâ€™s first round of shutdowns sent consumption plunging. An oil glut threatened to overwhelm storage, sending prices below $0 for the first time.<br />Signs that major producers intend to continue output cuts, as well as a faster-than-expected economic recovery in China, have since powered a rebound. Many traders now say further gains require an acceleration in demand from increased travel and a broader reopening.<br />Denting those hopes in recent sessions: the slow rollout of vaccines and warnings of ongoing pandemic restrictions. The Biden administration in recent sessions reimposed mask restrictions, warned of a mounting death toll and said it could take months to turn things around."
