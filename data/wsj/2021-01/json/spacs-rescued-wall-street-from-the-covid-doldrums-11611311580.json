    "body": "In 2020, underwriters were the kings of Wall Street.<br />The biggest investment banks recorded better-than-expected years, even though a global pandemic sent shockwaves through businesses and households. No business grew more than their operations selling stocks.<br />In the spring, clients bracing for economic trouble turned to stock markets to raise cash. In the latter part of 2020, it was the SPACs—special-purpose acquisition vehicles—that raised billions of dollars as a quick and suddenly popular way to get more companies into the public markets’ wide-open arms.<br />The banks’ fourth-quarter results provide fresh evidence of the equity-underwriting hot streak, raising hopes that SPACs may continue to boost the banks’ results even as the overall economy shows signs of slowing down.<br />A SPAC is a public entity with no business that raises investor funds through an initial public offering. That so-called blank-check company seeks a merger, allowing its new partner to go public without the delays and demands of a traditional IPO. They were a quiet corner of Wall Street for years but surged in popularity in 2020. SPACs raised $82 billion in the U.S. last year, greater than all of the money previously raised, according to Dealogic."
