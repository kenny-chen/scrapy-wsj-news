    "body": "The wildly unlikely story of Duncan Robinson is already the stuff of basketball legend.<br />A guy from Williams College transfers from Division III to Division I, goes undrafted out of Michigan by NBA teams, gets a two-way contract with the Miami Heat, toils on a G League team in South Dakota, signs a minimum deal with the Heat, earns a spot in the starting lineup for an NBA Finals team and proves himself to be a historically great 3-point shooter with a lucrative future in the league.<br />Now he’s taking the next step of his NBA career: He’s starting a podcast.<br />The first episode of Robinson’s show, The Long Shot, is being released this week through a podcast company founded by New Orleans Pelicans guard JJ Redick, the latest development in the rapidly expanding universe of NBA players illuminating their trade.<br />Their business relationship began when Redick was chatting with a Heat assistant coach after a game last season and Robinson mustered the nerve to introduce himself. “He had no idea who I was, I don’t think,” he said. They briefly exchanged pleasantries before Redick turned back to his conversation. “And then I stood there,” Robinson said."
