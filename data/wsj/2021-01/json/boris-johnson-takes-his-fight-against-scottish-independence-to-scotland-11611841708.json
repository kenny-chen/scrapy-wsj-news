    "body": "EDINBURGH—U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson brought his campaign to prevent Scotland breaking away from the U.K. north of the border on Thursday, as Brexit and his government’s faltering handling of the Covid-19 pandemic have bolstered support for Scottish independence.<br />Mr. Johnson is seeking to emphasize the benefits of the union as Scotland’s future emerges as the defining question facing the U.K. after its exit from the EU, a departure that most Scots opposed.<br />“The great benefits of cooperation across the whole of the U.K. have never been clearer than since the beginning of this pandemic,” Mr. Johnson said the night before the visit, which included a call at Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, where he toured a laboratory where nasal swabs are tested for the virus.<br />He pointed to how his government has helped roll out vaccines across the U.K., including Scotland, faster than anywhere in the EU, and provided vaccines and funds to support public services and subsidize thousands of jobs since the crisis began.<br />He argues that a 2014 referendum in which Scots chose to stay with the U.K. should be regarded as a once-in-a-generation event."
