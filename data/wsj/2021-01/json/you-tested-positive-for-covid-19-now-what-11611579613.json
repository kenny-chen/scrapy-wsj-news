Many people who learn they have tested positive wonder how long they will be contagious, what they should or shouldn’t do while quarantining and when they can expect to see symptoms abate.<br />We asked doctors for answers to questions about dealing with a positive Covid test.<br />How long will I be contagious?<br />The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 should isolate for 10 days starting at symptom onset. That means avoiding all contact with other people and not leaving home unless you need to go to a medical appointment. If you are asymptomatic and test positive and never develop symptoms, the isolation period should start on the day you took your diagnostic test. You are believed to no longer be contagious after 10 days if you have had no fever—and haven’t taken fever-reducing medication—for at least 24 hours and your symptoms are improving. The CDC recommends that immunocompromised patients and those with severe Covid-19 cases isolate for up to 20 days after symptoms appear.<br />"
