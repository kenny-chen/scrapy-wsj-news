    "body": "Lawmakers approved a resolution on Thursday allowing Lloyd Austin, a retired Army general, to hold the civilian post of defense secretary, clearing the way for his confirmation to the job.<br />If confirmed by senators as expected on Friday, Mr. Austin, 67 years old, will become the Defense Department’s first Black secretary.<br />Federal law requires any military officer who has been in civilian life for less than seven years to obtain a congressional waiver to serve as defense secretary, a requirement meant to safeguard the tradition of civilian control. Mr. Austin retired from the Army in 2016.<br />The House approved the waiver on a 326 to 78 vote. The Senate waiver vote was 69 to 27.<br />Retired Marine Corps Gen. Jim Mattis, former President Donald Trump’s first defense secretary, required a congressional waiver in 2017. Before Mr. Mattis, the only general ever to have received such a waiver was Gen. George Marshall, who served as defense chief 70 years ago."
