    "body": "With just a couple of minutes left in the NFC Championship, the Green Bay Packers made a baffling decision. They didn’t go for it on fourth down.<br />The Packers were down by eight points and gave up a shot at eight points to take three points. Instead, they never got the ball back. They lost. They became the starkest victim of making the wrong fourth-down call in an NFL playoffs that has been ruled by teams making the exact opposite decision.<br />Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers went for it on fourth down against the Packers—and made the Super Bowl because of it. The Kansas City Chiefs are the AFC champions because they did, too.<br />It’s a testament to how quickly one of the biggest decisions in football has evolved. Going for it on fourth down used to be a matter of gumption or necessity. Teams that went for it were bold. Or they were behind and had to. The ones that strayed from that script were brash.<br />Now going for it differentiates something else about teams: whether or not they’re making an analytically correct choice. A decision that used to be brazen is now considered nerdy."
