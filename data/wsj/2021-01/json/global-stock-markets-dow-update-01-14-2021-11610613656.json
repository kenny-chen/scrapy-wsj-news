    "body": "U.S. stock futures rose slightly Thursday as investors awaited details of the incoming Biden administration’s plans for a fresh coronavirus relief package.<br />Securities tied to the S&P 500 climbed 0.1%, potentially extending Wednesday’s advance, which lifted the broad-market index to its second-highest level ever. Those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%.<br />Jobless claims data Thursday showed that 965,000 people applied for unemployment insurance in the week ended Jan. 9, a sizable increase compared with the previous week and higher than economists had expected, as the surge in Covid-19 cases and fresh business restrictions weighed on the labor market.<br />Meantime, all eyes are on a speech expected Thursday from President-elect Joe Biden that is set to detail the scale of his proposed spending package to support households and businesses through the pandemic.<br />Additional stimulus would be favorable for equity markets and reinforce expectations for economic growth, said Luc Filip, head of private banking investments at SYZ Private Banking."
