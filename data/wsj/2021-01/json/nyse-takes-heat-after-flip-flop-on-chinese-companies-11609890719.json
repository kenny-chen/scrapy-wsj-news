    "body": "The New York Stock Exchange is in the hot seat after a baffling flip-flop in which it first said it would delist three Chinese companies to comply with an executive order from President Trump, only to reverse itself four days later.<br />The NYSE’s U-turn drew criticism from the administration of President Trump, who signed the order in November ordering a ban on the trading of securities of companies U.S. officials say have links to the Chinese military.<br />The order was one of the last salvos by Mr. Trump to get tough on Beijing and put the NYSE in a difficult situation since the exchange has long welcomed initial public offerings of companies from China.<br />While on a trip to Egypt, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called NYSE President Stacey Cunningham to object to the exchange operator’s reversal, a Trump administration official said. Mr. Mnuchin supports NYSE’s original plan to delist the companies, this official added.<br />News of his call to Ms. Cunningham was earlier reported by Bloomberg News. A spokesman for the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., declined to comment on the call from Mr. Mnuchin."
