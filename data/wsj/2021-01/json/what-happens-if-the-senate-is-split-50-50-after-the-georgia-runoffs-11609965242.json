    "body": "With Democrats winning both Senate seats in Georgia, the chamber will have a balance of 50-50, enough for their party to secure control there for the first time in six years. With President-elect Joe Biden set to be inaugurated on Jan. 20, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will then become the tiebreaking vote in the Senate.<br />Here are some questions and answers about the implications of a split Senate.<br />Yes, but not frequently. The last time the chamber was evenly split between the two parties was in 2001. Republican leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota cut a power-sharing deal that divided the committees and their resources evenly. Because Republican Vice President Dick Cheney could still break a tie, Republicans had control.<br />That 50-50 split didn’t last long, though. Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party in June of that year to become an independent and caucus with Democrats. Republicans won the majority back in the 2002 elections.<br />The party in Senate control decides what comes to the floor for a vote. A Democratic majority means that Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), the expected leader, will be able to control what legislation is given priority and what proposals are blocked. It also allows for more coordination with the Democratic-led House and the new Democratic White House."
