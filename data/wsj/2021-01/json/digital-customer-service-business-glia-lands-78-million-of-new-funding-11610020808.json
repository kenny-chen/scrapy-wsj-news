    "body": "Digital customer service provider Glia Technologies Inc. has raised fresh capital of $78 million in an investment led by existing backer Insight Partners.<br />The Series C capital brings Glia’s total funding so far to $107 million. The new investment comes at a time where Glia is experiencing explosive growth as the financial services businesses it serves have increasingly been forced to connect with customers digitally because of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Last year Glia’s annual recurring revenue rose by more than 150%, according to Chief Executive Dan Michaeli. Net customer retention exceeded 125% while 35% of revenue  growth stemmed from expansion bookings, he added.<br />The pandemic buoyed the company’s growth, as it kept many consumers at home who, for instance, would usually go into a bank branch in person to apply for a mortgage.<br />Glia’s products let customers connect with banks and insurers through multiple channels, including chat, audio, video, text, phone or through social media as alternatives to trying to call a customer service representative."
