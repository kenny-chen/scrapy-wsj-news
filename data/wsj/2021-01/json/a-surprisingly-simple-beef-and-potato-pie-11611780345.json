    "body": "SO MANY DISHES on the menu at Balkan Treat Box come straight from St. Louis’s Bosnian community, the largest outside Europe, said chef Loryn Nalic. Her husband and business partner, Edo Nalic, came to the city as a refugee in his teens. Early in their courtship, this recipe became a touchstone.<br />Ms. Nalic learned to cook the meat-and-potato pie helping to prepare for a community event. A phyllo crust with a filling of potatoes and smoked beef, it traditionally comes with yogurt drizzled on top—and also takes quite a long time to make, Ms. Nalic noted. At Balkan Treat Box doing things traditionally is very much the point, but for those cooking at home the chef has come up with a few short cuts.<br />Jumpstart the process by blanching the potatoes until they’re tender and creamy; meanwhile, sauté the onions and the sausage. For the crust? Frozen phyllo to the rescue. Simply layer sheets of thawed dough in a pan and brush with melted butter. Folded over the savory filling, the pastry bakes until golden and crisp. In addition to that drizzle of yogurt, you can add crumbled feta and some parsley if you really want to make it a feast (however fast).<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page."
