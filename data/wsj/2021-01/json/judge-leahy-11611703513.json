    "body": "Did the Senate just render its verdict two weeks before the latest impeachment trial of Donald Trump? The Journal’s Siobhan Hughes and Lindsay Wise report from Washington:<br />Since 17 Republicans would be needed to convict (assuming all Democrats vote against the former president) and it seems unlikely that  any senator would endorse a prosecution she deems unlawful—Democrats may now decide it’s pointless to go any further.<br />If they decide to press onward, they may struggle to present the appearance of a fair proceeding. Since Donald Trump is no longer president, Chief Justice John Roberts isn’t going to show up to preside.  Instead, the plan is for one of the Senate’s most ideological members to run the show.<br />Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), the chamber’s president pro tempore,  suggests in a tweet that he’s going to be even-handed:<br />Vermont’s senior senator is not exactly known for judiciousness. The Almanac of American Politics notes: “Leahy is a stalwart liberal known for periodic flashes of temper and can be a sharp-tongued partisan.” His voting record is barely distinguishable from that of his Vermont colleague, the socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders."
