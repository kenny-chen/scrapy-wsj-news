    "body": "The U.S. Senate on Friday confirmed Lloyd Austin, a retired Army general who most recently led all U.S. military operations in the Middle East, as President Biden’s defense secretary, making him the first Black secretary ever to run the department.<br />Mr. Austin, 67 years old, was confirmed in a 93-2 vote, becoming the second member of Mr. Biden’s cabinet to gain Senate approval, after Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines was confirmed on Wednesday.<br />Mr. Austin’s long military career—he was the first Black general to lead a division in combat or to command a theater of war—posed a challenge to his nomination as defense secretary, which is intended to be a civilian post.<br />Because he retired from the military less than seven years ago, Mr. Austin’s nomination required lawmakers to vote on two questions: whether to grant a waiver from legal provisions and whether to confirm him.<br />The House approved the waiver on Thursday on a 326 to 78 vote. The Senate waiver vote was 69 to 27."
