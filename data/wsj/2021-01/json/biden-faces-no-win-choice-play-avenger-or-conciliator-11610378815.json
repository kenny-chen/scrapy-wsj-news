    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden faces a lot of tough choices as he heads into office, but he now confronts a particularly fraught one: Does he play the role of avenger or conciliator?<br />It is a no-win proposition.<br />The stream of videos, pictures and sounds that continue to emerge from inside a Capitol under siege last week are showing in more graphic detail the horrors that unfolded when a pro-Trump mob showed up to try to stop the confirmation of Mr. Biden’s election over unproven charges of election fraud. One man ran through the Senate gallery carrying zip ties, the only logical use for which would be to handcuff hostages. The crowd chanted that Vice President Mike Pence, who was in the building, should be hanged.<br />A group of staff members of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hid under a conference table while the crowd outside, in search of the speaker, tried to break down the door. Two police officers who tried to defend the Capitol have died, one after having been hit in the head with a fire extinguisher.<br />Even Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager and White House counselor, responded over the weekend with a tweet saying, “Don’t avert your eyes & don’t excuse this. The more we see & learn, the worse it is.”"
