    "body": "Women who have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct will be compensated from a $17 million fund after a Delaware bankruptcy judge approved a plan to liquidate his former film studio.<br />The women are expected on average to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars or more under the deal to liquidate Weinstein Co., which filed for bankruptcy in 2018 after numerous allegations of sexual abuse and harassment against Mr. Weinstein became public.<br />Judge Mary Walrath of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., approved the settlement on Monday during a court hearing held via videoconference, saying the deal provides Mr. Weinstein’s victims with a fair and private process for obtaining compensation without having to endure years of public and uncertain legal proceedings.<br />Evidence presented during the chapter 11 case showed Mr. Weinstein abused women over several years, Judge Walrath said, adding that though the deal may provide closure for victims, compensation alone can’t provide complete recompense for harm they have suffered.<br />“I can only deal with the financial aspect of this,” Judge Walrath said."
