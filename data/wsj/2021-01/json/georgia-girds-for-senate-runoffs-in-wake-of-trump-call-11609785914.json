    "body": "SAVANNAH, Ga.—Georgians were bracing for Tuesday’s Senate runoff elections with their state in the political spotlight after President Trump urged state officials in a weekend phone call to nullify President-elect Joe Biden’s win in the November vote.<br />Gabriel Sterling, voting system implementation manager at the Georgia Secretary of State’s office, on Monday debunked inaccurate claims by the president and his allies about fraud in the state’s Nov. 3 election during a news conference at the State Capitol.<br />Mr. Trump’s campaign and a Trump elector previously said that data indicated that more than 66,000 voters under the age of 18 illegally voted. But state officials found that no underage voters cast ballots, Mr. Sterling said.<br />“This is all easily, provably false. Yet the president persists and, by doing so, undermines Georgians’ faith in the election system,” Mr. Sterling said.<br />Mr. Trump’s campaign earlier said as many as 2,560 felons voted illegally. Mr. Sterling said Monday that state officials have access to better data. He said 74 potential cases are under investigation but some of those people may have been eligible to vote for reasons such as having completed their sentences."
