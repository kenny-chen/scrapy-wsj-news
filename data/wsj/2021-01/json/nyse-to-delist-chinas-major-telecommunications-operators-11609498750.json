    "body": "The New York Stock Exchange will delist China’s three large telecommunication carriers, following a U.S. government order barring Americans from investing in firms it says help the Chinese military.<br />This will result in  China Mobile Ltd. —which is among the most valuable of China’s listed state-owned enterprises—being kicked off the Big Board after more than two decades, following the privatization of its predecessor in 1997.<br />NYSE said, at the latest, that it would suspend trading in securities issued by China Mobile,  China Telecom Corp. , and  China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd.  at 4 a.m. on Jan. 11. It will act four days sooner if it doesn’t get confirmation from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. that the clearinghouse will settle trades made on Jan. 7 and Jan. 8.<br />NYSE said it would also halt trading in closed-end funds and in exchange-traded products listed on its NYSE Arca exchange if they hold banned stocks.<br />On Friday, China Unicom said it will release a statement in due course. China Mobile and China Telecom didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment."
