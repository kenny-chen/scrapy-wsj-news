    "body": "SEOUL—North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the country’s approach to the U.S. wouldn’t change no matter who the president is, promising to advance its nuclear weapon program.<br />Mr. Kim, speaking at a rare Workers’ Party Congress meeting, made his lengthiest remarks about the U.S. in months, although he didn’t mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. Washington and Pyongyang remain stalemated on nuclear talks that haven’t shown discernible progress for nearly two years following the abrupt end to talks in Hanoi.<br />“Our biggest enemy and main hurdle is the U.S.,” said Mr. Kim, according to text of the remarks published by state media Saturday.<br />The key to Washington-Pyongyang relations, Mr. Kim said, was the U.S. dropping its hostile policy toward the North. That Kim regime assertion over the years has meant everything from U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and throughout Asia, their joint military drills and international discussion about the North’s human rights violations.<br />But the North Korean leader’s remarks about the U.S. were measured by Pyongyang’s saber-rattling standards. Mr. Kim didn’t make any imminent promise to launch missiles or threaten military action. He even referred to the North as being a “responsible nuclear weapons owner.”"
