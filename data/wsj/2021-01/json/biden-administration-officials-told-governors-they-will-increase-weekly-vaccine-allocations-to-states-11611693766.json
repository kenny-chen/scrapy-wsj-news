    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration on Tuesday said it would boost the supply of coronavirus vaccines sent to states by about 16% for the next three weeks and will purchase enough additional doses to vaccinate the U.S. population with a two-dose regimen by the end of the summer.<br />Senior administration officials said the federal government is working to purchase an additional 100 million doses each of the  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  vaccines, increasing the total U.S. vaccine order by 50% to 600 million from 400 million. Officials said they expect the additional doses to be delivered over the summer.<br />The purchases will provide enough supply to vaccinate 300 million Americans in a two-dose regimen over the summer.<br />Even with the increase in doses to states starting next week, supplies aren’t yet sufficient for what is needed, a senior administration official said.<br />“It’s going to take a number of months for us to be in a position for us to say to Americans it’s open season to sign up for vaccinations,” the official said."
