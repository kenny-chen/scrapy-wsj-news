    "body": "WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden, taking office at a time of national crisis, plans to emphasize themes of unity and recovery in his inaugural address, messages that he returned to repeatedly on the campaign trail on his way to victory over President Trump.<br />Mr. Biden’s outdoor address will come in unusual circumstances: secured by 25,000 National Guard troops before an empty National Mall only two weeks after supporters of Mr. Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol. With that historic event as a backdrop, Mr. Biden will focus on his approach to the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the U.S. and attempt to calm a nation grappling with racial and political divisions, his aides have said.<br />The inauguration’s theme is “America United,” and Mr. Biden’s speech is being written with the help of speechwriter Vinay Reddy and Mr. Biden’s longtime aide Mike Donilon, who will serve as a senior White House adviser, according to people familiar with the plans.<br />Mr. Biden’s top aides haven’t released details about his remarks, which the people familiar with his plans said Mr. Biden has been drafting since the start of his presidential transition in November. But aides have said his speech will be in keeping with the major themes of his campaign, including unity, bipartisanship and optimism.<br />“He wants to use the moment to call Americans to unity,” said Jen Psaki, Mr. Biden’s incoming press secretary."
