    "body": "TEL AVIV—Israel will begin vaccinating high-school students to target a demographic suspected of accelerating the country’s Covid-19 outbreak.<br />With the capacity to handle about 200,000 people a day, the country’s health authorities are able to vaccinate Israel’s approximately 300,000 16- to 18-year-olds in short order, but the challenge will be to ensure everyone shows up for a shot. Israel has approved the vaccine for anyone over 16. It won’t inoculate anyone under that age.<br />Ministry of Health data show that Israel’s younger population is far more likely to test positive for the coronavirus, with 10- to 19-year-olds making up 21% of known infections. The 20- to 29-year-old age group accounts for 19% of known infections.<br />“They are the megaspreaders,” Ido Hadari, director of government relations at Israel’s Maccabi Healthcare Services said of high-school students. “If we vaccinate these guys they will stop being spreaders.”<br />Israel is leading the world’s fastest vaccination campaign, so far administering the first dose of the  Pfizer Inc.  vaccine to almost 30% of its population since starting in late December. Israel has also received some shipments of the  Moderna Inc.  vaccine, but so far is mainly relying on Pfizer."
