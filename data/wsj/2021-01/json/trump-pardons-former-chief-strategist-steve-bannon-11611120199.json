    "body": "President Trump issued a flurry of controversial pardons and commutations on his final day in office, rewarding a handful of longtime allies and well-connected celebrities, including his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and onetime fundraiser Elliott Broidy.<br />The White House released the list of 143 pardons and commutations at 12:50 a.m.—less than eight hours before the president was set to leave for Florida—as Mr. Trump’s deliberations over who should receive clemency stretched late into the last full day of his term.<br />Of those ultimately granted clemency in the final hours of the Trump presidency, 18 were endorsed by the Justice Department office that reviews pardon applications, while the rest were recommended by an array of political leaders, criminal justice reformers and other allies of the president.<br />On Tuesday, the president was still calling advisers to ask them how he should proceed on certain pardons and waffled repeatedly over whether to grant one to Mr. Bannon, a person familiar with the conversations said.<br />At various points on Tuesday, advisers believed Mr. Bannon—who was charged in connection to a scheme to siphon money from a crowdfunding campaign for a border wall—wouldn’t get one. The White House in a statement said Mr. Bannon “has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen.”"
