    "body": "The Justice Department said it has reached a settlement with Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. division in the government’s long-running investigation into union corruption among top labor leaders in Detroit.<br />The U.S. subsidiary, known as FCA US and now part of Stellantis NV, the newly formed car company that absorbed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in a merger earlier this month, agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge of conspiring to violate U.S. labor law and pay a $30 million fine, according to statements released Wednesday by the company and the U.S. attorney’s office in Detroit.<br />FCA US also agreed to an independent compliance monitor for three years to oversee the closing of a worker training center that had been a focus of federal investigation and other internal controls related to that facility, the company said. The plea agreement is subject to court approval.<br />The settlement concludes the government’s investigation into FCA US for misconduct uncovered at the training center, an entity jointly operated with the United Auto Workers union.<br />Matthew Schneider, the U.S. Attorney in Detroit, said the plea agreement doesn’t preclude prosecutors from pursuing individuals at the company if new criminal evidence is uncovered."
