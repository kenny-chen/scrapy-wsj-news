    "body": "The Capitol occupation and riot of Jan. 6 will haunt American political life for years. Condemnation of the invasion of the Capitol is virtually universal, as is support for prosecuting those arrested inside.<br />By contrast, condemnation of the violence committed during the summer’s Black Lives Matter protests remains selective. Prosecutions for crimes against property or assaults on police are minimal. Last week, New York state Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the New York City Police Department for violating “individuals’ basic right to peacefully protest.”<br />The press is now doing long takeouts on right-wing militias, white supremacists and conspiracy theorists such as QAnon. That’s fine by me. These nuts should be locked up if convicted of crimes.<br />Meanwhile, the continuing and quite shocking anarchist, left-wing violence in Seattle and Portland, Ore., is inside-page news, if it’s reported at all.<br />At the White House Tuesday, President Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, was asked whether a federal intelligence-agency review of the Capitol occupiers would extend to the Portland rioters. She said that “all violence happening around the country will be reviewed.” Next question."
