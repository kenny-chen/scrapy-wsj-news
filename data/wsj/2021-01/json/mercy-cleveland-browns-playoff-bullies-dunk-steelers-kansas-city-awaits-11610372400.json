    "body": "It felt like a playoff game and an exorcism.<br />The Cleveland Browns scored 14 seconds into the contest—a fumble-recovery defensive touchdown on the first play, following a botched Pittsburgh snap. Then they scored again, five minutes later. Then they scored five minutes after that. Then another, less than three minutes later.<br />Thump, thump, thump, THUMP.<br />It was a cathartic, four-TD outburst for a franchise unaccustomed to consequential January football. Cleveland tallied an astonishing 28 points in the first quarter, going on to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in the NFL Wild-Card round Sunday, 48-37, earning the city its first playoff victory since 1995.<br />“Am I really seeing this right now?” NBC’s Al Michaels asked in the first quarter."
