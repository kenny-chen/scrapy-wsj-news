    "body": "KABUL—The Afghan government and the Taliban resumed talks aimed at ending nearly two decades of fighting, with recent targeted killings and widespread attacks underscoring the high stakes as U.S. troops are withdrawn from the country.<br />Kabul and the insurgent group began their first-ever peace talks in September in Qatar’s capital following a deal between the U.S. and the Taliban in February. Their delegations took a break last month after reaching a compromise on procedural disagreements.<br />Members of the two sides convened in Doha on Tuesday for negotiations that are likely to drag on for months, if not longer. Both sides will have an eye on the incoming Biden administration for any change in the U.S.’s Afghan policy—in particular its plan to draw down troops.<br />“The success of the talks also depends on future engagement from the U.S. on this issue,” said Nader Nadery, a negotiator and spokesman for the Afghan government.<br />The Taliban didn’t respond to a request for comment."
