    "body": "KAMPALA, Uganda—Presidential candidate Bobi Wine said he was under siege after soldiers stormed his home on Friday, raising fears of large-scale street protests when the results of Uganda’s election are declared on Saturday.<br />“The military has jumped over the fence and has now taken control of our home,” Mr. Wine said on his official  Twitter  account. “We are in serious trouble.”<br />A Ugandan police spokesman said Mr. Wine’s home in Kampala had been surrounded by security forces to prevent him from inciting violence.<br />Early results published by Uganda’s electoral commission on Friday showed President Yoweri Museveni taking an early lead, but Mr. Wine said earlier on Friday that the polls were falsified and that he was confident of victory. “I am very confident that we defeated the dictator by far,” he said.<br />Ugandans voted on Thursday amid heightened security and an internet shutdown after a hotly contested and violent race in which Mr. Wine, a youthful rapper-turned-lawmaker is attempting to unseat Mr. Museveni, one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders. The contest embodies a generational clash across Africa, where entrenched older leaders are grappling with increasingly restless youthful populations demanding improved economic opportunities."
