    "body": "LONDON—The U.K.’s health regulator authorized the use of  Moderna Inc.’s  Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, boosting the number of different shots at the country’s disposal to three as it battles a new variant of the virus.<br />The U.K. government said it agreed to purchase 17 million doses of the vaccine, which it expects to be delivered in spring once the U.S. drugmaker expands its production capacity.<br />The U.K. has already authorized two other vaccines against the virus: one developed jointly by  Pfizer Inc.  and Germany’s  BioNTech SE ,  and another by  AstraZeneca  PLC and the University of Oxford.<br />The Moderna vaccine, based on similar mRNA technology to that of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, was cleared for use in the European Union earlier this week and is already being rolled out in the U.S.<br />Britain is the first Western nation to have cleared three vaccines, as it embarks on a mass inoculation drive. The government is seeking to vaccinate around two million people a week in a bid to protect those most vulnerable to the disease."
