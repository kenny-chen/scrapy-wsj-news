    "body": "In the coming days, the New York Stock Exchange will start to delist American depositary receipts in China’s three big telecommunications operators. Here are some of the key questions this raises for investors.<br />What does delisting mean?<br />Delisting means shares are removed from a stock exchange and investors can no longer buy or sell them there. A delisting can be voluntary or involuntary. For example, in 2019 China’s  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. , a big chip maker whose shares mostly traded in Hong Kong, scrapped its less-active listing on the NYSE. Conversely, last year the  Nasdaq Stock Market forced China’s Luckin Coffee Inc. to delist after an accounting scandal.<br />In this case, the NYSE will delist ADRs from  China Mobile Ltd. ,  China Telecom Corp.  and China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. against the companies’ wishes.<br />What are Chinese ADRs?"
