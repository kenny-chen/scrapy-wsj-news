    "body": "The greatest threat to Donald Trump’s legacy is if his American presidency is seen by future historians as ending in farce and tragedy. We may be there.<br />For the last half of his Monday evening rally in Georgia for Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Mr. Trump read from the teleprompter a detailed description of the ways he believes election fraud was committed in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The two Republicans then lost.<br />On Wednesday in Washington, Mr. Trump delivered the same speech to a massive crowd, which then invaded the Capitol building, forcing the evacuation of Vice President Mike Pence and a general lockdown.<br />Political mockery is merciless, and so it was this week with the appearance of a viral video that recreates Mr. Trump making these election-fraud accusations seated at his desk in the Oval Office—“the numbers are corrupt, it was a rigged election, 100%”—as workmen remove the desk, with him attached to it, out of the office, down a White House hall and into the back of a truck, while he insists: “There’s tremendous fraud here. Wait just one second . . .”<br />That second has passed."
