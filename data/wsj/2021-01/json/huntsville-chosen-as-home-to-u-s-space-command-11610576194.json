    "body": "Military officials selected Huntsville, Ala., as the preferred location for the headquarters of the U.S. Space Command, delivering a coveted prize to an area with a long aerospace history and vibrant economy.<br />Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett chose the city from among six finalists, including Colorado Springs, Colo., and Cape Canaveral, Fla. The headquarters is slated to be housed at Redstone Arsenal, an Army post that also is home to tenants including the Marshall Space Flight Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.<br />The Space Force is a new military branch established in 2019 that is aimed at protecting U.S. and allied interests in space.<br />The secretary’s office highlighted Huntsville’s “qualified workforce, quality schools, superior infrastructure capacity and low initial and recurring costs” in its announcement. In addition, Redstone offered a facility to support the headquarters at no cost while a permanent home is built.<br />“Our state has long provided exceptional support for our military and their families as well as a rich and storied history when it comes to space exploration,” said Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey."
