    "body": "A Florida eye doctor convicted of defrauding Medicare of $73 million got a break when President Trump commuted the man’s sentence hours before vacating the White House.<br />The doctor, Salomon Melgen, age 66, received a 17-year sentence in 2018, which he has been serving at a federal prison in Miami, according to the Bureau of Prisons.<br />While Mr. Trump has been criticized for pardoning political allies such as his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, Dr. Melgen’s case represents a reprieve for a politically connected convict linked to a top Democrat: Before his fraud conviction, the North Palm Beach-based ophthalmologist stood trial alongside U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez for allegedly bribing the New Jersey Democrat. That case was dropped in 2018 after a mistrial.<br />A lawyer for Dr. Melgen, Sam Stern, didn’t respond to a request for comment Wednesday.<br />Spokespeople for Mr. Trump didn’t respond to requests for comment."
