    "body": "Shares in China’s three large telecom carriers were roiled Monday, after the New York Stock Exchange moved to delist the trio to comply with a U.S. government ban.<br />Hong Kong-listed shares in all three dipped sharply in the first trading session since the NYSE move was announced, before reversing course later in the day.<br />Stock in the largest,  China Mobile Ltd. , dropped as much as 4.5% before paring losses to close 0.8% lower. Its closing price was still the lowest since June 2006. Competitor  China Telecom Corp.  closed 2.8% lower, while  China Unicom ,  the smallest of the three, eked out a 0.5% gain.<br />Jefferies analyst Edison Lee said non-U.S. investors—who wouldn’t be covered by the ban—are “bottom-fishing.” Mr. Lee said the business fundamentals of the three firms had been improving, and China Mobile’s share price implied a high dividend yield of about 7.5%.<br />The NYSE late last week said it would suspend trading in securities issued by the three companies by Jan. 11, while halting trading in closed-end funds and exchange-traded products that hold banned stocks."
