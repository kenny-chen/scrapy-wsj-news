    "body": "Boeing Co. ’s drone unit has agreed to pay $25 million to settle civil-fraud allegations that it overcharged on more than half a dozen contracts signed with the U.S. Navy and special forces between 2009 and 2017.<br />Announced Tuesday by the Justice Department and Pentagon investigative agencies, the settlement stems from whistleblower claims by a then-official of the unit, Insitu Inc., that it knowingly charged new-part prices for “less expensive recycled, refurbished, reconditioned and/or reconfigured parts.” According to the Justice Department, the contracts with the Navy and the Pentagon’s Special Operations Command required new parts and materials.<br />Under provisions of the Federal False Claims Act, the government took over a civil suit initially filed by the whistleblower, who will receive more than $4.6 million of the total. Boeing didn’t acknowledge any wrongdoing.<br />The settlement comes less than a week after Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of a settlement resolving a criminal charge that it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the agency’s safety review of the 737 MAX jet. Prosecutors laid out a pattern of activity by two Boeing pilots to deceive regulators about a software system that ultimately led to two crashes in which a total of 346 people died.<br />Boeing acknowledged responsibility in that case, agreeing to pay a $244 million fine and pledging to tighten internal ethics rules and compliance standards."
