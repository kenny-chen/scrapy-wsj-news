    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Trump administration is removing criminal penalties for accidentally killing migratory birds, reversing longstanding federal policy in a move officials say will help landowners and businesses.<br />The final rule change, announced by the Interior Department Tuesday, completes changes proposed a year ago and in the works since 2017 to limit the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a 102-year-old law meant to protect the hundreds of bird species that are native to the U.S.<br />Business groups and local government officials have pushed for the change, saying criminal penalties are too harsh for accidental deaths.<br />But it comes at a time when bird populations are plummeting, facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.<br />Since 1970, North America has lost more than a quarter of its bird population, nearly 3 billion birds, according to research published in the journal Science in October 2019. The National Audubon Society said it recently recorded six million fewer birds in its 121st annual Christmas Bird Count than the year prior, despite record participation from counters."
