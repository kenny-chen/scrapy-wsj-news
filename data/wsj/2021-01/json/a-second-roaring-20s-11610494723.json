Next week we’ll ask, “Has censorship from the social-media companies gone too far or not far enough?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Jan. 19. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />From Disappointment to Ecstasy<br />At the start of 2020, New Year’s was rung in with an array of Roaring ’20s-themed festivities, intensifying the excitement of college students. We clinked glasses thinking an extravagant era of prosperity would coincide with what are supposed to be the best years of our lives. Instead, we got a pandemic and a recession.<br />Right now students are sacrificing their college experience for the safety of others who are more at risk. We are rewarded with a mediocre online education, to be completed from our bedrooms. As more time passes and the light at the end of the tunnel doesn’t brighten, images of friends and fun times seem a mere fantasy."
