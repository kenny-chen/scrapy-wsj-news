    "body": "WASHINGTON—Growth in demand for long-lasting manufactured goods slowed in December, as the overall economic recovery lost momentum at the end of last year.<br />New orders for durable goods—products designed to last at least three years—increased 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted $245.3 billion in December compared with November, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. That was the eighth straight month of gains, although the increase was the smallest since last August.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected new orders to increase 0.8% in December, after an upwardly revised 1.2% rise the previous month.<br />New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft—or so-called core capital goods orders, a closely watched proxy for business investment—increased 0.6% in December from the previous month, to $71.8 billion. The gain was also smaller than in recent months.<br />Another reading on business investment, and U.S. economic output broadly, will come Thursday when the Commerce Department releases its initial estimate of gross domestic product for 2020’s fourth quarter and full year."
