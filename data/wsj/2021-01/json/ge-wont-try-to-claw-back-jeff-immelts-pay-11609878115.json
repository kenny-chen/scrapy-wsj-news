    "body": "General Electric Co.’s board won’t claw back compensation from former CEO Jeff Immelt and other executives over  GE ’s  accounting issues or Mr. Immelt’s use of a backup corporate jet, ending a three-year probe into allegations of misconduct at the conglomerate.<br />The investigation didn’t find evidence to support shareholders’ claims of fraud and abuse, and pursuing litigation against former leaders wasn’t in the company’s interest, according to the law firm that GE’s board hired to run the process.<br />“The company does not have a sound legal claim to bring against any current or former officer, director or employee of the company, or against KPMG,” lawyers at Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP said in a letter dated Dec. 31 and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Since November 2017, GE’s board received 11 formal requests from shareholders with allegations for the board to investigate, including that executives and directors breached their fiduciary duties and violated securities laws, according to Cravath’s letter.<br />A GE spokeswoman confirmed the board’s conclusions and said, “We have significantly enhanced our disclosures and internal controls and are a stronger company today.” A representative for Mr. Immelt declined to comment. Lawyers representing some of the shareholders didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment."
