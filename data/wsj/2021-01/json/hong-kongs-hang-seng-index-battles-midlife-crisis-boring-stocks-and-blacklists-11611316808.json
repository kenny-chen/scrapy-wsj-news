    "body": "The Hang Seng Index, the main barometer of Hong Kong’s $6 trillion stock market, has fallen behind the times and now faces an uncertain future.<br />While the Hang Seng is off to a strong start for 2021, gaining 8.1% so far, it is in some ways catching up with other markets, after a dismal year in which it underperformed other benchmarks and retreated 3.4%.<br />A focus on banks and insurers has held the index back. Meanwhile, U.S.-China tensions have added to the uncertainty. As of Jan. 11, new investment in products tracking the Hang Seng became off-limits to American investors, due to a U.S. government block on investment in companies it says aid China’s military.<br />The blacklisted stocks include some Hang Seng constituents, such as  China Mobile Ltd. , and U.S. investors can’t buy funds that hold any shares in such companies.<br />In December, Hang Seng Indexes Co. began consulting on an overhaul. The index compiler—a unit of  Hang Seng Bank Ltd. , in turn majority owned by  HSBC Holdings  PLC—is collecting feedback on proposed changes, including increasing the index from 52 stocks to between 65 and 80."
