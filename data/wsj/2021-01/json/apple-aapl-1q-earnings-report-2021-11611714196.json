    "body": "<br />Apple Inc.  is expected to have finished 2020 with its most profitable quarter ever, fueled by an uptick in higher-end iPhone sales and a pandemic-induced surge in demand for its laptops and tablets.<br />All together, the Cupertino, Calif., company may have generated more than $100 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. On Wednesday, Apple is scheduled to release results for the three months that ended in December, its fiscal first quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect profit to have risen 8% to $24 billion and per-share earnings of $1.41.<br />The results come during the biggest week for corporate earnings this quarter and on the same day  Tesla Inc.  and  Facebook Inc.  are also expected to post record profits. Investors will be looking for signs from Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that tech stocks can continue to fuel record growth in the S&P 500.<br />Apple shares rose 81% in 2020 and are up about 8% this year through Tuesday on investor enthusiasm around its latest iPhone and heightened spending on its products from consumers working, going to school and seeking entertainment while stuck at home. It is one of a number of tech companies whose outsize performance contrasts with the millions of Americans out of work amid the global pandemic."
