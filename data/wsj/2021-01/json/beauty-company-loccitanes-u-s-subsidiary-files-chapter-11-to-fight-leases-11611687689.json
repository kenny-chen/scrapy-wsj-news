    "body": "The U.S. division of French beauty products maker  L’Occitane International SA  has filed for bankruptcy, behind on $15 million in rent and seeking to shed lease obligations after the Covid-19 pandemic cut into sales.<br />The U.S. unit L’Occitane Inc., which operates 166 boutiques in 36 states and Puerto Rico, filed a chapter 11 petition Tuesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton, N.J., for the purpose of relieving itself of what it called increasingly untenable lease obligations.<br />Like other retailers, L’Occitane has been hurt by the pandemic, which has made consumers less willing to shop in person, according to a declaration filed in bankruptcy court by Yann Tanini, regional managing director for L’Occitane.<br />The company filed court papers seeking to reject 29 “burdensome” lease agreements and exit from those locations, where it said its rent obligations “no longer reflect the market.”<br />L’Occitane joins the ranks of a growing number of retailers, from huge department-store chains such as  J.C. Penney Co.  to boutiques like Sur La Table Inc., to have filed for chapter 11 during the pandemic."
