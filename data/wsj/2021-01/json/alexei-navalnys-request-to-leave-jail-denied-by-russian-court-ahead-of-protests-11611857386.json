    "body": "MOSCOW—A Russian court denied a request to free Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Thursday as authorities extended their crackdown on his inner circle, maintaining pressure on the opposition movement ahead of more planned protests this weekend against President Vladimir Putin.<br />Mr. Navalny’s lawyers had appealed for his release from jail, where he has been since authorities stopped him Jan. 17 upon his return from Germany after recovering from poisoning.<br />A swell of demonstrations last weekend against Mr. Navalny’s detention saw more than 100,000 people take to the streets, according to local media. Police this week have detained a number of Mr. Navalny’s allies, including his brother Oleg, and raided apartments and offices, alleging the protests violated health and safety rules during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Among those detained were Lyubov Sobol, a lawyer on Mr. Navalny’s team; Ilya Pakhomov, an assistant to the opposition politician; and Anastasia Vasilieva, who runs an affiliated medical workers’ advocacy group.<br />Mr. Navalny’s supporters say the legal actions are in retribution for the weekend protests."
