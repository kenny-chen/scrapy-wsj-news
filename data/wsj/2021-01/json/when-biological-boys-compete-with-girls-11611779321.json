    "body": "I applaud Abigail Shrier in her advocacy of girls, especially when it comes to the thorny issue of transgender girls’ participation in sports (“Joe Biden’s First Day Began the End of Girls’ Sports,” op-ed, Jan. 23). Perhaps no issue encapsulates the hypocrisy of the far-left agenda than putting the needs of the few—transgender girls—above those of the many—biological girls. I am hopeful that female athletes will unite in opposition to President Biden’s recent executive order and that prominent female athletes will express their discontent. As Ms. Shrier eloquently writes, so much is at stake for the next generation of girls. As the father of a first-grade daughter, this issue is resonant for me.<br />Jonathan N. Fiskus<br />Riverdale, N.Y.<br /><br />Abigail Shrier cites the example of just two trans athletes competing successfully against natal girls, speculating, without evidence, on the possible repercussions for “scouting and scholarship opportunities and trophies.” This thin argument fails to support the headline’s dire prediction and Ms. Shrier’s contention, with its wily figure shaming, about “a body blow to the rights of women and girls.”"
