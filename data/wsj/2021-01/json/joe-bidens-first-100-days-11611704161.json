    "body": "Editor’s note: This week’s Future View discusses early priorities for President Biden. For next week, we’ll ask students what they make of the president’s policy changes allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military and letting transgender high-school girls compete on girls’ sports teams. Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Feb. 2. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Force Congress to Cooperate<br />President Biden inherits a deeply polarized nation. He must fulfill his promise, made during his campaign and inaugural address, to instill unity. Fixing our polarization demands something other than business as usual. It requires cultivating a nontribal, no-nonsense environment in which legislators have no option but to cooperate.<br />Mr. Biden should harness the presidential veto power to reject any legislation that doesn’t receive support from at least 20% of the opposition. The constraint would force lawmakers to come to creative compromises, crafting legislation that the broad majority of the country would support. This would set the tone for the American public, demonstrating that civility and cooperation are possible."
