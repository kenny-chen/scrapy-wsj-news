    "body": "LOS ANGELES—When it comes to the movie release calendar, Hollywood studios are stuck in a “Groundhog Day” routine of delays.<br />A fresh batch of films scheduled for theatrical release in February, March or April are being postponed or sold to streaming services as cases of Covid-19 stay at high levels across the country. Executives say to expect a cascade of rescheduling that stretches into the summer moviegoing season.<br />“Morbius,” a “Spider-Man” spinoff scheduled for release by Sony Pictures Entertainment on March 19, will now debut on Oct. 8, giving the studio a seven-month leeway and delaying what was expected to be the first big-budget, wide-release offering since theaters closed last March.<br />Hollywood executives anticipate more major releases to follow, including the twice-delayed James Bond installment “No Time to Die,” currently planned for an April release that now seems a remote possibility. Sony’s new “Cinderella” adaptation and the  Walt Disney Co.  prequel “The King’s Man,” both scheduled for release within the next two months, could get bumped as well.<br />Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution at  ViacomCBS Inc.’s  Paramount Pictures, projects moviegoing will resume to varying degrees in May and June ahead of a “very bullish” third quarter. For his part, he has scheduled one of his studio’s biggest 2021 movies, “Top Gun: Maverick,” to premiere July 2, and said he doesn’t expect that date to change."
