    "body": "William McGurn’s “Beijing’s Bigger Honey Trap” (Main Street, Dec. 29) recycles unattributed comments about programming decisions at Columbia’s Beijing Global Center in 2015 to raise the specter of self-censorship. The claim is both false and at odds with the core principles of academic freedom and open debate that define our institution. Public events hosted by our Beijing Center are determined independent of their political content. That was the case in 2015 and remains the case today, in Beijing and at each of our global centers. The mission of a university is to foster an atmosphere conducive to discussing controversial topics, and it is this commitment to openness and diversity that makes American higher ed the envy of the world.<br />Prof. Safwan Masri<br />Columbia University<br />New York"
