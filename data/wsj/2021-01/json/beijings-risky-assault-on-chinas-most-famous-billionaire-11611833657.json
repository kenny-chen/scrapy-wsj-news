    "body": "Chinese fintech giant Ant Group Co. may need to downgrade its ambitions in the face of a still-evolving regulatory squeeze. The impact will ripple far beyond the company and has the potential to damage incentives for innovation and entrepreneurship in China over the long term.<br />Ant was set for a colossal $34.4 billion initial public offering until late last year, but will now instead turn itself into a financial holding company, according to people familiar with the matter. That would make it subject to higher capital requirements and probably dramatically slower growth.<br />What is happening is emblematic of two trends. The first is Beijing’s desire to get a tighter grip on China’s booming online financial services industry.<br />Ant has had a revolutionary impact on Chinese consumer finance—creating what was at one point the largest money-market fund in the world—helping expand access to loans for small borrowers. That’s not without drawbacks, however, including serious financial stability concerns. Ant’s capital-light model of originating loans for banks for a fee without taking on much risk itself created a clear potential for abuse.<br />But the second trend is a political culture that can’t brook alternative centers of influence."
