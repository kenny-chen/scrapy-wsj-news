    "body": "President Biden wants to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and Democratic allies in Congress released new details Tuesday on legislation to lift the wage floor in phases over five years. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour since 2009, with a patchwork of states increasing the wage floor above that minimum.<br />Here is what we know about the status of the $15 minimum-wage proposal:<br />Mr. Biden in two recent speeches called for a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, which requires action by Congress. A bill introduced by Democrats this week would increase the wage floor to $15 an hour in phases over five years, starting at $9.50 an hour the day a new law becomes effective. Annual increases would follow until reaching $15 an hour, then the rate would be reviewed annually and adjusted based on changes to median hourly earnings of all employees.<br />Democrats also proposed gradual elimination of subminimum wages for workers who are in part paid through tips. That minimum wage for adult workers is currently $2.13 an hour. The bill also eliminates separate subminimum wages for youth and disabled workers.<br />Democrats say raising the minimum wage will help lift the lowest-wage workers out of poverty and give them more spending power. The proposal matches a level long backed by labor unions."
