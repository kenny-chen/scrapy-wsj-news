    "body": "American Financial Group Inc.  on Wednesday said it agreed to sell its annuity business to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. in a $3.5 billion cash deal.<br />The acquisition will deliver new ways for the giant Springfield, Mass., company, one of the nation’s oldest life insurers, to sell its products. MassMutual has long had one of the biggest fleets of career agents in the U.S., and the deal will add opportunities to sell through banks, independent broker dealers and independent agents, analysts said.<br />American Financial said the transaction will mark its exit from the market for fixed and indexed annuities, which are popular retirement products with conservative savers. It will focus more tightly on its property-and-casualty insurance operations.<br />The Cincinnati-based insurer is the latest U.S. insurer to divest annuity operations, as ultralow interest rates pressure companies’ abilities to earn healthy profits on the product line.<br />The transaction is the third life-insurance-industry transaction in a week and one of many over a decade of frenzied industrywide activity, as insurers have been narrowing their focus and divesting product lines, much of it motivated by the low interest-rate environment. Insurers invest customers’ premiums until needed to pay claims, so low rates make many products challenging to profitably sell."
