    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Pentagon’s acting chief abruptly reversed course, sending an aircraft carrier to the Middle East to counter threats posed by Iran, days after directing it to leave the region over the advice of top military advisers.<br />Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller said in a statement Sunday evening that he had directed the USS Nimitz to the Middle East, three days after ordering that it be sent home.<br />The move was a remarkable change of heart for Mr. Miller, who had previously ordered the carrier be sent home against advice by top commanders that the carrier needed to remain near the Middle East because it represented an important show of force at a time when the threat posed by Iran was high, officials said.<br />“Due to the recent threats issued by Iranian leaders against President Trump and other U.S. government officials, I have ordered the USS Nimitz to halt its routine redeployment,” the statement said. “The USS Nimitz will now remain on station in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. No one should doubt the resolve of the United States of America.”<br />The statement didn’t say how long the carrier would remain in the region."
