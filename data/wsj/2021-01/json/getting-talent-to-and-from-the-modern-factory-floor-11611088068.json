    "body": "Regarding “Help Wanted on the Factory Floor” (Exchange, Jan. 9): In Syracuse, N.Y., we have many jobs open but the low-income worker lacks transportation to and from the job. Five-plus years ago our nonprofit saw the impediment and started a shuttle-to-work transportation program.<br />We received some small grants and bought vans, hired drivers and began taking people to/from jobs. Several companies sponsored shuttles and we have helped about 350 people get or keep a job.<br />It benefits the worker, company and government. For each $1 of grant funding, the county receives $65 in taxes from people working. Our program can solve a lot of problems in unemployment, and it benefits everyone.<br />We are willing to share the “secret sauce” if a community would like to set up a program to help their businesses and their unemployed.<br />Deborah Hundley"
