    "body": "BAGHDAD—A joint U.S.-Iraqi military strike killed the top leader of Islamic State in Iraq this week, setting back the extremist group’s local leadership as it attempts to stage a bloody resurgence, American and Iraqi officials said Friday.<br />The air-and-ground operation on Jan. 27 near the northern city of Kirkuk killed 10 Islamic State members, including Abu Yasir al-Issawi who led the organization in the country, according to the officials.<br />A U.S.-led coalition airstrike struck the group’s hideout in a network of caves, which was followed by an Iraqi ground attack on the area, said Sabah al-Numan, spokesman for Iraq’s counterterrorism forces. Some Islamic State fighters detonated explosive vests while others were shot dead, he said.<br />The operation took place less than a week after Islamic State carried out its worst attack on Iraqi civilians in years, a double suicide bombing on a busy Baghdad street that killed 32 people.<br />“Yasir’s death is another significant blow to Daesh resurgence efforts in Iraq,” said Col. Wayne Marotto, the spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, using the Arabic acronym for the group, in a tweet."
