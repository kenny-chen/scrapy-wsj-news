    "body": "Turkey’s notoriously volatile markets have roared back in recent weeks, a sign that investors are pouring into the riskiest corners of the global investment universe.<br />The Turkish lira reached its highest level against the U.S. dollar in four months as foreign investors have increased holdings of the country’s stocks and bonds after its central bank began a series of interest-rate raises.<br />Investors added $1.4 billion to local stocks and $2.5 billion to local bonds in the last two months of 2020, after they had withdrawn more than $13 billion in stocks and bonds through the first 10 months of the year, according to data from Turkey’s central bank. Turkey’s benchmark stock index, the Borsa Istanbul 100, is up more than 10% over the past month and more than 70% from its low last year.<br />This has pushed the lira to its strongest level against the dollar since Aug. 19, with one dollar buying 7.3342 lira as of Wednesday.<br />Investors have piled into emerging markets broadly, expecting that the economies hardest hit by Covid-19—and that have seen less fiscal support than other nations—will have a strong bounceback due to the global vaccine rollout. A recent bout of dollar weakness is also expected to boost demand for exports of dollar-priced commodities including oil, giving more support to economic rebounds in emerging markets."
