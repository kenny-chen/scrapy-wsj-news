    "body": "WASHINGTON—Nearly all Senate Republicans voted to endorse the idea that impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump are unconstitutional, a blow to Democrats’ hopes of recruiting significant GOP support for conviction in the trial set to begin in two weeks.<br />In the 55-45 vote Tuesday to table, or kill, a procedural motion declaring the trial unconstitutional, five Republicans voted to table the motion, siding with all Democrats that the trial should proceed. The five were Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.<br />Forty-five Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, voted to support the assertion of Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) that the impeachment trial of a now-private citizen violates the Constitution and therefore is not in order.<br />A conviction at the conclusion of the trial would require 17 Republicans to join all 50 Democrats to reach the two-thirds supermajority required.<br />Mr. Paul wrote earlier this week that the impeachment trial was “a farce and should be dismissed before it is even allowed to begin.” After the vote, Mr. Paul said the roll call showed that there aren’t enough Republican senators willing to convict Mr. Trump."
