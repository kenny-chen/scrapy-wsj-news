    "body": "London’s historic financial district has voted to remove statues of two 18th- century merchants who profited from slavery after the Black Lives Matter movement prompted growing scrutiny of the U.K.’s role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.<br />The City of London Corporation, which governs the historic Square Mile that at one time housed many of Britain’s financial institutions, opted to remove the statues of William Beckford and John Cass from its offices at the medieval-era Guildhall, likely adding to the continuing debate over how the U.K. should account for its colonial past.<br />Last year, in other parts of the country, protesters toppled a bronze statue to 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, Minn. in May. They dumped it in the city’s harbor.<br />Protesters in Oxford called for the removal of a statue of Cecil Rhodes, who helped subjugate parts of Africa for the British Empire, but college authorities declined to take it down.<br />In Scotland, demonstrators briefly relabeled city streets in Glasgow after U.S. civil rights leaders covering the names of the merchants who profited from the sugar and tobacco trade, which were heavily dependent on slave labor."
