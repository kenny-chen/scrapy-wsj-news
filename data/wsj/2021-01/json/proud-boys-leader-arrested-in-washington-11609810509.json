    "body": "WASHINGTON—The leader of the far-right Proud Boys was arrested on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., and charged in connection with unrest that followed pro-Trump protests in the nation’s capital last month.<br />Metropolitan Police arrested Enrique Tarrio, 36 years old, and charged him with destruction of property related to the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner belonging to a historic Black church, a police spokesman said. Police also charged him with possession of what they said were two “high-capacity firearm magazines.”<br />Mr. Tarrio didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking comment. A social-media account for the Proud Boys on Monday night said the group had started a legal-defense fund for him.<br />Mr. Tarrio told the Washington Post in December he participated in burning a Black Lives Matter banner that had been ripped from the Asbury United Methodist Church, a historic Black church during unrest that followed pro-Trump protests in the capital. He told the Post he would plead guilty to destruction of property, pay the church the cost of the banner and accept arrest if authorities filed charges.<br />The night of the burning, brawls broke out between some demonstrators and counterprotesters. Several people, including eight police officers, were hurt, authorities said at the time."
