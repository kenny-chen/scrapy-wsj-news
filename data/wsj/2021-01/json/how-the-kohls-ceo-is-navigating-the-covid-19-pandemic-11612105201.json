    "body": "On March 20,  Kohl’s  CEO Michelle Gass temporarily shut the retail chain’s 1,162 department stores and announced soon after that it would furlough 85,000 of its roughly 100,000 employees. The store closings lasted between seven and 17 weeks, depending on location.<br />At a recent Future of Leadership event hosted by The Wall Street Journal, Ms. Gass discussed how she and her team tried to support staff at all levels of the company during these and other difficult decisions of the past 10 months. They aimed to lead by example to prevent burnout while working remotely and found innovative ways to communicate, she said.<br />A former  Starbucks  executive, Ms. Gass, 52, joined Kohl’s in 2013 as chief merchandising and customer officer and was promoted to the top job five years later. Having worked directly with former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz as his chief strategist during the 2008 recession, Ms. Gass was no stranger to the challenges of navigating a high-profile business, with stores and staff scattered across the country, through periods of uncertainty.<br />Ms. Gass shared her blueprint for ensuring that Kohl’s weathers the global health crisis both financially, and with its company culture and morale intact. Edited excerpts from the conversation:<br />What were your strategies for communicating tough news to your employees in the early days of the pandemic?"
