    "body": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resigned Thursday night, becoming the second member of President Trump’s cabinet to quit since the deadly mob attack on Capitol Hill, which she said was fueled by Mr. Trump’s rhetoric.<br />“We should be highlighting and celebrating your Administration’s many accomplishments on behalf of the American people,” Mrs. DeVos wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump obtained by The Wall Street Journal. “Instead we are left to clean up the mess caused by violent protesters overrunning the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the people’s business. That behavior was unconscionable for our country. There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me.”<br />Her resignation is effective Friday. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said earlier Thursday she would resign, citing the “entirely avoidable” storming of the Capitol building.<br />Mrs. DeVos had been one of the administration’s longest-serving cabinet members—and one of its most polarizing. When the Senate confirmed her nomination in February 2017, she was the first cabinet nominee in U.S. history to require a tiebreaking vote from the vice president—in this case, Mike Pence.<br />Teachers’ unions and progressive activists had strongly opposed her for her lifelong work promoting charter schools, which are publicly funded but often run by private firms. Mrs. DeVos, a Michigan billionaire, also supported vouchers, which use tax dollars to enable students to attend private schools."
