    "body": "I am disappointed by Amanda Foreman’s uncritical reporting of a supposed medieval superstition that the Perseid meteor shower was caused by St. Lawrence’s burning tears (“Awed by the Meteors of the New Year’s Sky,” Review, Jan. 2).<br />That people in the Middle Ages seriously believed the Perseids to be St. Lawrence’s tears is simply not true. Aristotle’s Meteorologica was well known in Latin translation in the Middle Ages, so his theory of exhalations would have been current.<br />Medieval language was rich with allegory and metaphor, and those of the time often drew such types of connections to natural phenomena (a similar concept: we moderns refer to the heart as the seat of feelings, despite our biological knowledge to the contrary).<br />The first source for this tradition, Edward Herrick, wrote in 1839 when the Scientific Revolution was well under way. As was often the case in the 19th century, he misinterpreted the allegory of ages past for superstitious beliefs about the nature of the universe. Discussions of history should reflect the better understanding we now have of medieval idiom and style.<br />Timothy Lesinski"
