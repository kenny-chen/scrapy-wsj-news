    "body": "SHANGHAI—Chinese car sales declined 6.8% last year, as the world’s largest market for automobiles shrank for a third straight year.<br />Yet the single-digit drop counted as a success in the context of 2020, industry analysts said, with the coronavirus pandemic taking an even heavier toll on other markets. Global car sales are estimated to have fallen 15% last year, according to research firm  IHS Markit ,  while U.S. sales are also expected to have dropped about 15%.<br />“In Q1 we projected much, much worse,” said Lin Huaibin, an auto analyst at IHS Markit, after sales in China slumped 41% in the March quarter, during which parts of the country were in lockdown.<br />Auto makers in China sold 19.29 million passenger vehicles last year, the China Passenger Car Association said Monday, down roughly a fifth on 2017, the market’s peak.<br />“This year will see a much stronger growth,” said Cui Dongshu, the association’s secretary-general. The group expects car sales in China to rise 7% in 2021."
