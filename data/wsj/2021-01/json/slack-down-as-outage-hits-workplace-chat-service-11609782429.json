Customers were experiencing problems loading channels and connecting to Slack, the company said Monday morning.<br />The San Francisco-based company was able to restore access for most of its affected users by midafternoon with limited performance issues. “We’re seeing improvements with error rates on our side, and we believe affected customers should be able to access Slack,” the company said.<br />Slack said it was still working to resolve issues with the functionality of some calendar apps as well as troubles with email notifications. It recommended users refresh or restart the application to see if there is an improvement.<br />Temporary interruptions for popular online services are relatively common, but their effects are being felt more as many employees turn to cloud services and other connected platforms to help them work remotely amid the pandemic."
