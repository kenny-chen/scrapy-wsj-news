    "body": "Recent ructions in U.S. government bond markets have revived discussions of a potential “taper tantrum,” mirroring the expectations of a sudden rise in interest rates that came in 2013 as the Federal Reserve signaled its intention to cut back its enormous bond-buying program.<br />At the time, the news took investors by surprise and rocked emerging markets. There is less prospect of that this time: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says he wants the Fed to signal any tapering well in advance.<br />But just as important, developing markets look better insulated than in 2013.<br />It wasn’t just the taper tantrum itself that mattered for emerging markets but the currency-market shifts during the subsequent year. The ICE Dollar Index rose by as much as 25% from the spring of 2014 to the spring of 2015. That surge disrupted years of planning by corporations and governments, which had anticipated a relatively weak dollar, something that seemed like the new normal for almost a decade.<br />That wouldn’t be the case today. For one, the dollar’s decline in 2020 was far smaller than its mid-2000s plunge. A similar climb would take the dollar into rarefied territory seen only between 2000 and 2002. That isn’t impossible but doesn’t seem likely."
