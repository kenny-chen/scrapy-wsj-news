    "body": "Bargains on Wall Street are hard to find after the fierce 2020 rally that swept through stock and bond markets. Some investors are sifting through complex securities that were among the hardest hit during the panic of this past spring.<br />Bonds backed by commercial real estate and corporate loans traded for less than 50 cents on the dollar after the pandemic hit and margin calls triggered forced selling. Their recovery has lagged behind the broad market rebound that followed, in part because the selloff wrought havoc with the finances of many firms that buy these securities.<br />But now, with vaccine distributions rolling out and many other asset classes having rallied to prices few expected to see, fund managers see attractive returns in the year to come.<br />The risk is plain to see. The bonds are rated below investment grade and can be linked to properties and companies with high vulnerability to the pandemic, like hotels, mall retailers and airlines.<br />Still, relatively low prices mean the bonds offer “protections you can’t find anywhere else with this kind of yield,” said Jay Huang, the head of structured credit invetsments at CIFC Asset Management who buys collateralized loan obligations, Wall Street reformulations of lower-rated debt. “There’s still a ton of catching up to do versus the broader market.”"
