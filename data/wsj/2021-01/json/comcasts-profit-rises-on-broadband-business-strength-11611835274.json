    "body": "Comcast Corp.  posted a 6.9% rise in fourth-quarter net profit, boosted by continued growth at its broadband business, while the coronavirus pandemic continued to pressure its movie and theme-park units.<br />The virus has forced millions of Americans to work and learn from home, increasing their reliance on their internet providers, and led many movie theaters to shut down and theme parks to operate at limited capacity.<br />Philadelphia-based Comcast—owner of Xfinity-branded services, the NBCUniversal media empire and the Sky television business—posted fourth-quarter net profit of $3.38 billion, or 73 cents a share, beating FactSet analyst estimates. Revenue slipped 2.4% to $27.71 billion.<br />Comcast said it added 538,000 broadband customers during the quarter, helping the company’s cable segment—which includes iXfinity-branded internet, cable-TV, phone and mobile services—post a 6.3% rise in revenue to $15.7 billion. Comcast added two million broadband customers last year, a record.<br />The company’s Universal Studios theme parks suffered a 63% drop in revenue to $579 million, though Comcast said the unit broke even last quarter when excluding the pre-opening costs associated with its Beijing Resort."
