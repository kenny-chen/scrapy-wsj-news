    "body": "MGM Resorts International  said Tuesday it is no longer pursuing a deal to buy British gambling company  Entain  PLC, a deal that would have bolstered the casino operator’s presence in online-gambling.<br />Earlier this month, the Las Vegas-based casino operator made a bid for Entain by offering 0.6 of its shares for each Entain share, worth £8.09 billion ($10.99 billion). The Wall Street Journal first reported on MGM’s takeover approaches.<br />Entain, known as GVC Holdings until recently, had said that the deal, representing a 22% premium, undervalued the company.<br />“After careful consideration and having reflected on the limited recent engagement between the respective companies regarding MGM’s rejected all-stock proposal at an exchange ratio of 0.6 times, it does not intend to submit a revised proposal and it will not make a firm offer for Entain,” MGM said.<br />Entain, which owns the British gambling brand Ladbrokes, said it looks forward to continuing to work closely with MGM through their U.S. joint venture BetMGM."
