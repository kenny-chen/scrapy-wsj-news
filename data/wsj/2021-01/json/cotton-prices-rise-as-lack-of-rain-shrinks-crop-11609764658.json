    "body": "Cotton prices have risen to their highest level in nearly two years thanks to dry weather that has shrunk the crop and concerns of forced labor in China that have made a big chunk of the nation’s fiber output off-limits to clothing makers.<br />The most-active cotton futures contract ended Thursday at over 78 cents a pound, up 55% since prices bottomed on April 1 during the early days of U.S. coronavirus lockdown orders.<br />A lack of rainfall in key growing regions has reduced expectations for the current crop. The International Cotton Advisory Committee last month trimmed its estimates for the global harvest by about 1%. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects the smallest domestic crop in five years.<br />The weather in Texas—the country’s top cotton-producing state—has been especially challenging for farmers. Walt Hagood, who grows cotton on 3,500 acres in the western part of the state near Lubbock, said drought has reduced his yield by about a third this year.<br />“We’ve been in a bad cycle here for several years now,” he said."
