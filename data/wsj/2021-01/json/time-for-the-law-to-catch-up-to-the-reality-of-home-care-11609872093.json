    "body": "On behalf of the thousands of in-home care providers across the country, I thank Anna Wilde Mathews and Tom McGinty for their article “Nursing Homes Face Persistent Fall in Use” (Page One, Dec. 22). Our government must listen to citizens who want to stay at home as they age.<br />Modernizing federal and state Medicaid rules is a must. When they were created in the 1960s, the only option was to send grandparents to a “rest home” when their health began to fail. Today Americans can bring professional caregivers into their homes. Yet in state after state, Medicaid plans still consider only nursing homes an entitlement for older and disabled Americans, while home care is funded only when a state applies for a waiver.<br />It’s also time to look at Medicare offerings and provide seniors options that often cost less than what insurance pays. Four hours of personal care in a person’s home—helping with bathing, grooming, meal preparation and medication adherence—can prevent and delay the need for emergent care, hospitalizations and nursing homes. Medicare Advantage plans are permitted to pay for in-home care and other supplemental services. Why isn’t that same benefit offered to seniors who have elected traditional Medicare?<br />Vicki Hoak<br />Executive Director"
