    "body": "The owner of Staples made an unsolicited offer to take over  Office Depot  in a deal worth more than $2 billion, looking to unite the rival office-supply superstores whose previous marriage attempts have been thwarted by competition concerns.<br />It marks the third time that Staples has tried to acquire its main bricks-and-mortar rival. Previous efforts, including a deal worth $6.3 billion five years ago, were blocked by antitrust enforcers. The latest offer was made public Monday by Staples.<br />The  ODP Corp. ,  Office Depot ’s  parent company, said its board of directors is reviewing the proposal and will consider potential antitrust and regulatory challenges.<br />The retail landscape has changed since the companies’ last attempt to merge, with  Amazon.com Inc.  expanding deeper into office supplies and the Covid-19 pandemic leaving many people working or learning from home. Both Office Depot and Staples have large e-commerce operations, but Office Depot’s revenue has suffered as many corporate offices have been closed. Closely held Staples doesn’t disclose its financial results.<br />After the last failed deal, Staples was taken private by Sycamore Partners, a hedge fund that has scooped up battered retail chains, in a leveraged buyout in 2017. The company, now controlled by a Sycamore subsidiary called USR Parent Inc., said Monday it is proposing to buy ODP for $40 a share in cash."
