    "body": "Connecticut’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout has been relatively smooth, health officials said, while the U.S. and many states lag behind their original distribution plans.<br />The state has administered about half its allotted doses, compared with neighboring New York, which has administered nearly one-third of its allotment, and New Jersey, with little more than a quarter of its doses distributed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Across the U.S., about 28% of all the first doses have been administered, according to the CDC.<br />The shortfall is due in part to a lag in reporting data, government officials and health experts said. But as the federal government has left it to states to determine what to do with the vaccines, and with some states pushing decision-making to local health departments and hospitals, the process has hit snags in many places.<br />Connecticut hospital executives said open lines of communication with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office and the Connecticut Department of Public Health, along with good coordination among the state’s hospitals have been important factors during the first phase. About 300,000 health-care and long-term care workers are eligible for the first phase.<br />“Our hospital systems, our federally qualified health centers and our local health departments have been successful in standing up very large clinics in very short order and getting those employees into those clinics and getting them vaccinated,” the state’s acting health commissioner, Deidre Gifford, said."
