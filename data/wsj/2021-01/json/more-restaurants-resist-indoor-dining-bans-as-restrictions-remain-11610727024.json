    "body": "Dean Pappas is stuck between an indoor-dining ban and a hard place.<br />His family has been running the Glen Oak Cafe in Glen Ellyn, Ill., for 43 years. Thanks to carryout and a $57,000 federal loan, Mr. Pappas managed to avoid going out of business when pandemic lockdowns forced him to suspend indoor dining from March to June. The construction of a tent helped him regain a sizable amount of business over the summer. But business plunged in October when the state ordered restaurants in his county to stop offering indoor dining for a second time; it was banned statewide the following month. Mr. Pappas ignored the mandates and kept serving customers indoors at his 160-seat breakfast and lunch restaurant.<br />Nonetheless, sales remain 60% lower from last year.<br />“I’m not making anything,” said Mr. Pappas, 60 years old. “But at least I’m keeping the place going.”<br />Tensions are growing in parts of the country over on-premises dining and drinking bans, one of the most visible pandemic-related restrictions for many Americans in the crisis’s current phase."
