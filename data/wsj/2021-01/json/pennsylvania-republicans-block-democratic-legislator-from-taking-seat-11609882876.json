    "body": "Republicans leaders of the Pennsylvania Senate refused to seat a Democrat whose win was certified by state election officials, prompting Democratic senators to walk out on the first day of the legislative session.<br />The majority Senate Republicans on Tuesday also removed Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman from presiding over the day’s session in Harrisburg, the state capital, after Mr. Fetterman declined to go along with the move.<br />State officials certified incumbent Sen. Jim Brewster as the winner of a Senate contest in Western Pennsylvania. State election results show Mr. Brewster defeated his Republican challenger Nicole Ziccarelli by 69 votes out of more than 132,000 votes cast.<br />Republican Sen. Jake Corman, the top-ranking senator, said Monday he wouldn’t permit Mr. Brewster to be sworn in because of Ms. Ziccarelli’s pending lawsuit in federal court. The suit alleges that the Allegheny County Board of Elections improperly counted mail-in ballots that were signed but undated. In late November, the state Supreme Court ruled against Ms. Ziccarelli, finding that a missing date wasn’t a reason to invalidate a ballot.<br />“Ziccarelli’s position is that Pennsylvania election law is entirely clear that voters must sign and date their mail-in ballot to be counted,” Mr. Corman said in a statement."
