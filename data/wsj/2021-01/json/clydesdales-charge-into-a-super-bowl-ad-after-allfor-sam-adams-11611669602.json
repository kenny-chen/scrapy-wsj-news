    "body": "The maker of Sam Adams beer is hijacking Budweiser’s iconic Clydesdales ad campaign, in an attempt to steal some attention during the publicity blitz that typically surrounds the Super Bowl.<br />The commercial won’t be visible to most people watching the game on Feb. 7:  Boston Beer Co.  is only paying for the ad to air in New York and Boston, allowing it to sidestep a decadeslong exclusivity deal between television networks and Budweiser’s parent, as well as saving millions of dollars in the process.<br />Other advertisers, including pharmaceutical company  GlaxoSmithKline  PLC, are also making a play for Super Bowl attention without airing national ads during the game—an increasingly popular approach known as ambush marketing.<br />While approaches vary, the mission is simple: Craft a stunt creative enough that it can attract attention on social and traditional media in the weeks leading up to the game.<br />Boston Beer, which also makes the hard seltzer Truly, is spending $770,000 to air its ad in New York and Boston, a fraction of the roughly $5.6 million it costs for 30 seconds of airtime during the national broadcast of the game on  ViacomCBS Inc.’s  CBS."
