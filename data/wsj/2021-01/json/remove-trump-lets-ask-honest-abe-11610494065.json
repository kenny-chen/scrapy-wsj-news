    "body": "Whenever I am perplexed about an important political issue, I turn for guidance to the greatest statesman in American history. “In this and like communities,” Abraham Lincoln said during a debate with Stephen Douglas, “public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed.”<br />Judged against this standard, can impeaching President Trump and removing him from office succeed? A Quinnipiac University survey released on Monday suggests that it cannot.<br />Yes, 52% of Americans favor removing President Trump from office, compared with 45% who oppose it. But the partisan divisions are deep. While 89% of Democrats support this course, 87% of Republicans oppose it, and independents are split.<br />Underlying this stark divide are radically divergent interpretations of the November presidential election and its aftermath. Some 73% of Republicans believe that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Only 5% of Democrats do.<br />These dueling beliefs have consequences. Seventy-three percent of Republicans think that Mr. Trump’s actions since the election have aimed at protecting democracy; 95% of Democrats think that he has been undermining democracy."
