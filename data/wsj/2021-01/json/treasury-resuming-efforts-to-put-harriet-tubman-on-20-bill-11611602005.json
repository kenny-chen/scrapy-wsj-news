    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House said the Treasury Department was resuming efforts to put escaped slave turned abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.<br />Putting Tubman’s image on the currency had been undertaken by the Obama administration but the work wasn’t completed during former President Donald Trump’s tenure. “We’re exploring ways to speed up that effort,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.<br />Ms. Psaki said it was important that the nation’s currency and notes “reflect the history and diversity of our country, and Harriet Tubman’s image gracing the new $20 note would certainly reflect that.”<br />The redesign of the bill would place a woman on the front of U.S. paper currency for the first time in more than a century and replace President Andrew Jackson, a slave owner, who would move to the back of the note.<br />The Treasury Department’s watchdog agreed in 2019 to review the agency’s plan after Democrats said the Trump Treasury Department had intentionally slow-walked the proposal."
