    "body": "Organizers of the Tokyo Olympics face a long list of obstacles as they attempt to carry off the postponed Games in six months—and the alarming rise in Covid cases around the world recently is only one of them.<br />Potentially bigger hurdles include the need to speed up Covid-19 vaccinations globally and in the U.S. and convincing a skeptical Japanese public to accept vaccines and welcome thousands of visitors from around the globe.<br />The International Olympic Committee and organizers in Japan last March delayed the Games from 2020 to 2021, a move that came about four months before the event was set to begin. They are now closing in on the same decision-making window for 2021, with last year’s problems still in play and a few new ones that have surfaced as the pandemic has continued.<br />Vaccinations—for the hosts, athletes and spectators—are a big topic.<br />Although Olympic organizers have said they won’t require vaccines for fans and athletes coming to the Games, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said he wants almost everyone in Japan vaccinated by the Olympics’ July 23 start. Japan has secured enough vaccines to inoculate all of its population, though none has yet received local regulatory approval and the country hasn’t started vaccinations."
