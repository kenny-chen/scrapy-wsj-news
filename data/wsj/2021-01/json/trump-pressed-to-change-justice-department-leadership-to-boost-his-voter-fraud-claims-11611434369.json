    "body": "In his last weeks in office, former President Donald Trump considered replacing the acting attorney general with another official who would be more amenable to pursuing unproven claims of election fraud, people familiar with the matter said.<br />The plan was stymied when the Justice Department’s top leaders agreed on a conference call in early January that they would resign en masse if Mr. Trump fired then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, the people said, averting what could have become a new crisis in the administration’s waning days.<br />In Mr. Rosen’s place, Mr. Trump had considered installing another senior Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, who had expressed a willingness to use the department’s power to help the former president continue his unsuccessful legal battles contesting the election results, these people said.<br />Mr. Clark denied involvement in a plan to oust Mr. Rosen, which was first reported by the New York Times.<br />“My practice is to rely on sworn testimony to assess disputed factual claims,” Mr. Clark said in a statement sent to The Wall Street Journal after the publication of the story in the Times. “There were no ‘maneuver[s].’ There was a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president. It is unfortunate that those who were part of a privileged legal conversation would comment in public about such internal deliberations, while also distorting any discussions.…Observing legal privileges, which I will adhere to even if others will not, prevents me from divulging specifics regarding the conversation.”"
