    "body": "President Biden’s plan to use a Cold War-era law to boost the Covid-19 vaccination effort isn’t likely to expand production significantly in the near term, but it could jump-start vaccinations by increasing other supplies such as syringes, vaccine manufacturers and experts say.<br />Mr. Biden has invoked the Defense Production Act to take certain steps to expand vaccine manufacturing, such as producing more equipment and materials used to make shots. He also will use the act to boost supplies such as “low dead space” syringes, which can be used to squeeze more doses out of vaccine vials.<br />Mr. Biden, inaugurated Wednesday, has set a plan to administer 100 million vaccine doses in the first 100 days of his presidency.<br />The goal of invoking the DPA is to ensure all available vaccines are being used and administered quicker, an administration official said. The administration is working to help increase supplies such as syringes, the official said, and trying to get ahead of problems it anticipates with hard-to-source critical items to prevent future vaccine shortages.<br />The Defense Production Act was enacted during the Korean War to spur domestic industry to shore up the military, and has been amended since to grant powers that can be used in national emergencies."
