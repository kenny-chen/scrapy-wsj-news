    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Trump sympathized with rioters who stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, telling them “we love you” but also saying “go home in peace” hours after dozens of his supporters fought past police to enter the building, fueling criticism that the president had stoked the assault.<br />“This was a fraudulent election but we can’t play into the hands of these people, we have to have peace,” Mr. Trump said in a video released on  Twitter .  “So go home, we love you, you’re very special.”<br />While he said law enforcement needed to be protected, Mr. Trump said to the rioters, “I know how you feel.”<br />Mr. Trump added later on Twitter, “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace.” Twitter labeled the tweet with a notice that the claim of election fraud was disputed. The posts and the video were later removed altogether.<br />Both the House and Senate chambers had gaveled out of session shortly after 2 p.m. local time after rioters breached the Capitol. Mr. Trump spoke to protesters who had shown up earlier that day at an event on the Ellipse, near the White House, saying he wouldn’t concede and urging them to go to the Capitol."
