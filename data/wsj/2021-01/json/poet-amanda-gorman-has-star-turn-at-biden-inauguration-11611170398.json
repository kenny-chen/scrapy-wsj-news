    "body": "Inaugural poet Amanda Gorman brought former presidents, lawmakers and dignitaries to their feet as she read a poem that aimed to inspire after the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol. She delivered it standing outside that very building.<br />“We’ve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy,” she read. “And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.”<br />The 22-year-old from Los Angeles is the first National Youth Poet Laureate and the youngest poet to read at a presidential inauguration. Her mother watched from the socially distant, masked audience.<br />President Biden’s inaugural committee told Ms. Gorman on Dec. 30 that she had been selected for the role.<br />She said she approached the task very deliberately, first reviewing speeches given by abolitionist Frederick Douglass and President Lincoln and others who have spoken at divisive times."
