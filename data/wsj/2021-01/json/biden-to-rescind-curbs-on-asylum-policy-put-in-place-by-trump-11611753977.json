    "body": "President Biden plans to sign more immigration-related executive actions reversing his predecessor’s policies on asylum seekers and refugees in the coming days, according to people familiar with the plans.<br />Mr. Biden is expected to issue an order on Friday laying out a plan to revamp the asylum system, after the Trump administration took numerous steps to restrict access to humanitarian protection in the U.S.<br />That order would direct the Department of Homeland Security to roll back rules the previous administration enacted to make most asylum applicants at the southern border ineligible. For example, one rule disqualified applicants from asylum if they passed through a third country en route to the U.S. without making a claim in that country.<br />The order would also freeze agreements that the Trump administration signed with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to send asylum seekers to those countries to request protection there instead.<br />Mr. Biden is also expected to rescind a memo that created a program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, which has forced tens of thousands of asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. southern border to return to Mexico and wait, sometimes for years, as the American court system processes their requests."
