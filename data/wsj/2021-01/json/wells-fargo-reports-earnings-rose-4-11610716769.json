    "body": "Wells Fargo  & Co.’s profit rose 4% in the final three months of the year.<br />The San Francisco-based lender said Friday that it made $2.99 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $2.87 billion a year earlier. Per-share profit totaled 64 cents, compared with analyst forecasts of 59 cents.<br />Wells Fargo’s results reflect a topsy-turvy year in which the pandemic-induced recession forced lenders to sock away tens of billions of dollars to prepare for a wave of soured loans. The bank released $757 million from its pile of reserves in the fourth quarter, largely because it no longer had to stow away cash on a book of student loans it sold.<br />Net charge-offs remained low at $584 million, down almost a quarter from a year earlier. So far, the government’s expanded unemployment, stimulus checks, small business relief and loan deferral programs have staved off widespread loan losses, but bank executives caution they could still be coming.<br />With banks so far weathering the crisis, regulators at the Federal Reserve said last month they could start buying back their own stock again, though total shareholder returns are limited to the quarterly profit they generated over the past year. Wells Fargo said its board approved the repurchase of an additional 500 million shares."
