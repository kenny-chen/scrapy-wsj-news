    "body": "Brazil began its Covid-19 vaccine rollout Sunday with the shot developed by China’s Sinovac, minutes after its approval by regulators, promising to bring relief to a country that is struggling to cope with a surge in infections.<br />The country’s health regulator, Anvisa, approved emergency use of the Chinese vaccine, known as CoronaVac, as well as the shot developed by  AstraZeneca  PLC and Oxford University.<br />The ruling follows a bitter tug of war between President Jair Bolsonaro and São Paulo’s powerful state governor, João Doria, to secure the first vaccines for the country of more than 210 million people.<br />Gov. Doria, who is expected to run for president next year, has led a partnership with Chinese company Sinovac Biotech Ltd. to test and produce CoronaVac in São Paulo, criticizing what he has called a “genocidal” lack of action by Mr. Bolsonaro.<br />The dispute comes as the country’s average daily death toll approaches 1,000 people, with scientists warning that a new variant that likely emerged in the Amazon could be partly responsible for a recent surge in infections. For the past week, Brazil has registered an average of more than 50,000 new cases of the disease each day—the highest since the pandemic began."
