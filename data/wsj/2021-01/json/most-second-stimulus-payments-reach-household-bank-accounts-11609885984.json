    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. Treasury Department has sent out more than $112 billion in stimulus payments electronically, meaning that about two-thirds of the second round of payments approved by Congress is already in households’ bank accounts, according to data released Tuesday.<br />The payments—$600 per adult and $600 per child—were estimated to cost about $164 billion in all. They are part of a broader relief law last month that also includes unemployment insurance and money for small businesses.<br />The pace of payments is faster than in the spring, when the government made the first round of payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. Then, about half the payments reached bank accounts within two weeks. Now, more than two-thirds of the money has gone out within about one week after President Trump signed the law passed by Congress.<br />In addition to the $112 billion in electronic payments, the government is also mailing checks and prepaid debit cards. It hasn’t said how many payments have been made.<br />“While the IRS has been able to deliver the second round of Economic Impact Payments in record time, we understand there are many questions and we appreciate everyone’s patience during this period,” the agency said in a statement late Tuesday."
