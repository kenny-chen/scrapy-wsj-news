    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court Tuesday reinstated requirements that women seeking medication abortions make in-person visits to pick up their prescriptions, siding with the Trump administration over medical organizations that argued the mandate exposes patients to needless risks during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The court’s three liberal justices dissented from the majority’s brief, unsigned order.<br />In March, the Food and Drug Administration relaxed in-person dispensing requirements for other drugs and encouraged telemedicine to reduce the spread of Covid-19. But the Trump administration, which opposes abortion rights, left in place regulations requiring women to make in-person visits to a hospital, clinic or physician’s office to pick up mifepristone, one of two drugs used to induce a medication abortion.<br />The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an organization of women’s health-care physicians, and other groups sued the FDA over its exclusion of mifepristone, also known by the brand name Mifeprex.<br />The group’s president, Dr. Eva Chalas, said patients should be able to obtain mifepristone, like other drugs, through mail delivery."
