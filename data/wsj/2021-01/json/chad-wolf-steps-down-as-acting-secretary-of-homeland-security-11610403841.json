    "body": "WASHINGTON—Chad Wolf is stepping down as acting secretary of Homeland Security, citing several recent court decisions ruling he wasn’t serving legally in the acting post, according to an email he sent to department staff Monday afternoon.<br />He will be succeeded by Pete Gaynor, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for the remainder of President Trump’s term.<br />Mr. Wolf, the fifth official to lead the Homeland Security Department in Mr. Trump’s four years in office, assumed the post in November 2019 after Kevin McAleenan, who was also serving in an acting capacity, stepped down. The Department hasn’t had a leader confirmed by the Senate since Kirstjen Nielsen submitted her resignation in April 2019.<br />Mr. Wolf ultimately made the decision to leave, an aide said, because of an arcane law forbidding acting officials to continue to serve in their posts if the White House withdraws their Senate nomination.<br />Mr. Wolf was nominated to serve as Homeland Security secretary in August, but the White House withdrew his nomination last Wednesday in a move it hasn’t since explained. The aide pointed out that Mr. Wolf on Thursday became the first cabinet-level official to call on Mr. Trump by name to condemn the attack on the Capitol building the day earlier."
