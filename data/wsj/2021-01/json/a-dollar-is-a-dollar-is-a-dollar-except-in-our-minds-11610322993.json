    "body": "Do you care if a clerk at the drugstore gives you change in one $10 bill or two $5 bills?<br />Are you more reluctant to spend hard-earned dollars than windfall dollars?<br />Do you distinguish the “income” dollars paid as dividends on your stock from the “capital” dollars of the value of stock itself?<br />Rational investors answer “no” to each of the three questions. After all, money is money, and rational investors can easily distinguish between the substance of money and its form. Hard-earned dollars and capital dollars are no greener than windfall dollars and income dollars.<br />Normal investors, however, are likely to answer “no” to the first question, but many are sure to answer “yes” to the second and third questions."
