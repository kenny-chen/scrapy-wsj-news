    "body": "Hong Kong shares have surged to a 20-month high, and trading volumes have hit records, as investors from mainland China have jumped into the market in search of bargains and stocks not available back home.<br />A large chunk of the cash has gone into stocks that the U.S. has ruled off-limits for American investors, such as smartphone maker  Xiaomi Corp. , oil major  Cnooc Ltd. , and  China Mobile Ltd. , the country’s largest telecommunications carrier.<br />The money is flowing through the Stock Connect program, a trading link between Hong Kong and exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Analysts and investors said mainland investors would likely become more influential in Hong Kong.<br />Gary Zhang, a partner at Shenzhen Grand Gold Capital Co., said the rush of capital “isn’t just hot money but an ongoing trend.”<br />As of Wednesday, net buying from the mainland this month had already hit the equivalent of $26.5 billion, beating the previous full monthly record by more than 47%, according to Wind. On Tuesday, total turnover on the stock exchange hit a daily record, at the equivalent of $39 billion, with so-called southbound turnover also at its highest ever."
