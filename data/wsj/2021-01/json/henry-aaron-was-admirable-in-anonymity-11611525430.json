    "body": "We were in the fetch-your-own-coffee area of the Embassy Suites airport hotel in Columbus, Ohio. We had never met, but I was almost certain who he was. And I was surprised that he had attracted not a single glance from anyone else in the place.<br />This was five or six years ago. Henry Aaron—he always preferred Henry to Hank—had passed his 80th birthday, and in a business suit at the table next to mine he read the newspaper and passed the time alone.<br />There seemed to be a stir in the lobby, and I asked a young hotel employee what was going on. She told me that Tony Hawk, a renowned skateboarder whose likeness has been featured on a series of videogames, was on the premises.<br />Henry Aaron had heard my question and her answer. As if reading my mind—why was he, one of the greatest baseball players who ever lived, sitting here seemingly unrecognized?—he said, with a smile:<br />“It’s been many years since I wore a uniform.”"
