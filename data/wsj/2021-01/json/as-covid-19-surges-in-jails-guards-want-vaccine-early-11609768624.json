    "body": "<br />Prison guards, criminologists and public-health advocates across the U.S. are pushing for prisons to receive Covid-19 vaccines early, arguing that a national surge of the disease among inmates and staff puts them at particularly high risk of infection and death.<br />Health officials say inoculating guards without giving the shot to prisoners wouldn’t help stop the spread, spurring a debate over whether people convicted of crimes should be vaccinated ahead of the general population.<br />“There’s no way it’s going to go to prisoners before it goes to people who haven’t committed any crime,” said Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, after a draft of a state vaccine plan that came out in December put the incarcerated people ahead of those over 65 and other vulnerable populations.<br />A spokeswoman for the governor said inmates will receive the vaccine based on need, at the same time as members of the general public."
