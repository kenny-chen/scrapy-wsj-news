    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden has tapped Dr. Kevin O’Connor to serve as White House physician, succeeding Dr. Sean Conley in a role that generated controversy under former President Donald Trump.<br />A White House official confirmed the appointment and cited Dr. O’Connor’s personal relationship with Mr. Biden, who at 78 years old is the oldest president to take office. Dr. O’Connor was Mr. Biden’s physician during his time as vice president and prepared his medical report during the 2020 campaign, declaring the then-candidate “healthy” and “vigorous.”<br />It isn’t uncommon for new presidents to choose their own physicians, although Mr. Trump initially retained Dr. Ronny Jackson, a Navy rear admiral who served in the role under former President Barack Obama. A White House physician is typically responsible for the medical care of the president, the first family and White House staff.<br />Although the position is typically low-profile, both Dr. Jackson and Dr. Conley drew scrutiny for what some said were overly rosy assessments of Mr. Trump’s health. Dr. Conley also faced criticism for providing conflicting information about Mr. Trump’s condition when he was diagnosed with coronavirus in the fall.<br />Dr. Jackson was subsequently nominated by Mr. Trump to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, but he withdrew from consideration amid allegations of misconduct while serving as the president’s personal physician. Dr. Jackson, who has remained a close Trump ally, was elected to Congress in November as a Texas Republican."
