    "body": "McDonald’s Corp.  said renewed restrictions around the world aiming to contain the coronavirus pandemic are hurting its global sales and profit.<br />The fast-food giant on Thursday reported that U.S. same-store sales grew 5.5% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, an improvement from the third quarter’s 4.6% increase. Staple menu items sold by the burger company boosted U.S. sales, McDonald’s said.<br />But tightened restrictions on businesses and indoor dining, particularly in Western Europe, dragged on business abroad, McDonald’s said. Fourth-quarter sales at international restaurants that McDonald’s runs were down 7.4% from a year earlier, improving on the previous quarter’s 10.1% decline.<br />But overall, McDonald’s said costs related to the pandemic, including spending on safety equipment and marketing, ate into profit during its latest period. The company reported earnings, adjusted for one-time items, of $1.70 a share for the quarter, missing analysts’ expectations of $1.77 a share. Revenue of $5.3 billion for the quarter also came in slightly below projections.<br />A surge in Covid-19 cases depressed sales across many consumer sectors late last year. For restaurants, the impact was especially acute in places that required them to shut their dining rooms again."
