    "body": "In the last decade Liam Neeson has played a lot of grizzled loners who take out bad guys using grit and guns. Mining that vein has paid off in a new way for the 68-year-old action star during the pandemic. He has scored two No. 1 movies in the last three months, by supplying multiplexes with much-needed new releases and audiences willing to turn out for his brand of movie.<br />“Maybe these stories hark back to a simpler time of a man taking on evil people in a very basic, fundamental fashion,” Mr. Neeson said in an email.<br />In “The Marksman,” released Jan. 15, he stars as a hardscrabble Arizona rancher who protects a boy who crosses the border illegally with his mother to escape a Mexican crime cartel. Ticket sales were strongest in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Florida and Texas. The film, made for about $30 million, is now in its second week as the highest grossing movie, with total ticket sales of $6.1 million—in the one-third of domestic theaters currently open. A similar pattern played out in October (when more theaters were open) for the release of “Honest Thief,” featuring Mr. Neeson as a bank robber double-crossed by FBI agents. The movie grossed about $14 million domestically.<br /><br />"
