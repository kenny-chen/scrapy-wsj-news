    "body": "I guess it makes sense, amid an unprecedented, upturned, stay-at-home year, that we get this: Tom Brady, logging in for a work-from-home Super Bowl.<br />To be clear: SB LV will not literally be WFH. Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will not send a link to play the Kansas City Chiefs via Zoom, or Google Hangouts, on Sunday, Feb. 7.<br />Still, what’s going to happen hasn’t ever happened: a Super Bowl participant (Tampa Bay) playing in its comfy home coliseum (Raymond James Stadium).<br />Brady can wake in his own bed, in his own plush jammies, wander out to the kitchen, pour himself a delicious 24 oz. of water, eat two raw almonds, stare out at that orange and cerulean Gulf Coast sky, and know he can park in his own parking space, and get dressed at his own locker.<br />As middle-aged conveniences go, it’s pretty dreamy."
