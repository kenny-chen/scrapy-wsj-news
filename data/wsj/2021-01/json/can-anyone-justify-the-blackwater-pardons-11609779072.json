    "body": "Your characterization of the pardons of the Blackwater mercenaries as “hard to justify” (“Trump’s Weissmann Pardons,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 26) is a masterpiece of understatement. These four killers opened fire with machine guns and grenade launchers on a crowd of unarmed men, women and children. Seventeen innocent civilians were killed. Might the pardons be connected to the fact that Blackwater was founded by Erik Prince, a Trump buddy and informal adviser?<br />Don Kaul<br />Chicago<br /><br />Your editorial calls the pardons of former State Department security guards “hard to justify” and comments that they “show disrespect for American soldiers who must be disciplined under great stress on the battlefield.” To the contrary, the Justice Department’s obsessive prosecution of these decorated veterans disrespected U.S. fighters making split-second decisions in a war zone."
