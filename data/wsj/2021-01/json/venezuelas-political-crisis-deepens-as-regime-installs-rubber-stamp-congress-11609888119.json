    "body": "Venezuela’s regime installed a rubber-stamp congress Tuesday, challenging an opposition legislature run by lawmaker Juan Guaidó that says it remains the nation’s sole democratic institution.<br />Soldiers and armored vehicles cordoned off the National Assembly building in downtown Caracas to allow 277 new members of congress to be sworn in. The legislators won elections last month that were boycotted by the opposition and deemed a sham by countries like the U.S., Brazil and neighboring Colombia.<br />The opposition had been in control of the National Assembly since 2015 but saw most of its powers stripped away by authoritarian President Nicolás Maduro in recent years. Among the newly elected assembly lawmakers are Mr. Maduro’s son and wife.<br />“The U.S. firmly rejects the farcical swearing in of the ill-named National Assembly that fake President Maduro is trying to impose,” the U.S. Embassy’s special section on Venezuela, which is based in neighboring Colombia, said in a Twitter post Tuesday.<br />Mr. Maduro now controls all formal levers of power, including the security services, as he tightens his grip on a country where the economy has collapsed in recent years, prompting millions of Venezuelans to flee."
