    "body": "Your account in “Liberation Day for French Dressing” (Review & Outlook, Dec. 28) of federal regulation of the composition of French salad dressing down to its pH content is why I marvel whenever I hear that we need more regulation. I am reminded of the bromidic liberal refrain of “getting the government out of the bedroom.” Not only is the government in the bedroom, it is in the living room, the dining room, the bathroom and every other room. Government is so deep into our kitchens that it is in our salad dressing.<br />John Santoliquido<br />Mays Landing, N.J.<br /><br />You rightly decry the “standards of identity” that dictate with precision what constitutes French dressing and other products. The biggest proponents of this overreach in recent years have been meat and dairy interests, which try to stop soy-milk makers from calling their products soy milk and veggie-burger companies from calling theirs veggie burgers. Vermont and Wisconsin Democrats and cattle-state Republicans have attempted to codify these regulations in law."
