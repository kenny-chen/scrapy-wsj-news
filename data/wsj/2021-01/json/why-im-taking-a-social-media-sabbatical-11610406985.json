    "body": "I’m suspending indefinitely my use of  Twitter ,   Facebook  and other social media. I’m doing so not to make a political statement, but in the hope that America can return to kitchen tables, churches, taverns, coffee shops, dance halls (it’s a Texas thing)—whatever it takes to look others in the eye and rebuild our communities and humanity.<br />As a husband and father, I also want to stop spending so much time looking at a screen and reacting in ways that are inconsistent with who I am and—most important—who I strive to be as a Christian.<br />While social media has proved a useful vehicle for sharing information quickly, I have concluded that it does more harm than good to individuals and society alike.<br />It tempts us to be reactive and feeds the worst of our human tendency to respond in anger rather than to stop and think before communicating. The result is more verbal combat and less deliberative thought—all with language we often wouldn’t use while looking someone in the eye. I have been guilty of this recently, and I haven’t always been proud of my language.<br />It reduces the value of communication to statements graded by “likes” or being “ratioed,” and other mechanisms that don’t reflect real human response or quality of thought."
