    "body": "Business leaders and trade groups called for an end to the violence in Washington D.C. on Wednesday as supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol where legislators were meeting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win.<br />The comments came during a week of statements and meetings involving corporate executives as they sought to publicly urge a smooth transfer of power while Mr. Trump and others disputed his election defeat.<br />Rioters forced lawmakers to shelter in place on Wednesday as Capitol Police rushed leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives from the floor. The developments came on a day when congressional allies of Mr. Trump challenged the election results from several states. Vice President Mike Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have rejected calls to overturn election results.<br />James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of  JPMorgan Chase  & Co., the country’s largest bank, said the violence doesn’t represent the U.S. “Our elected leaders have a responsibility to call for an end to the violence, accept the results, and, as our democracy has for hundreds of years, support the peaceful transition of power,\" Mr. Dimon said in a statement.<br />Marc Benioff, the chief executive of  Salesforce.com Inc.,  tweeted: “Our leaders must call for peace and unity now. There is no room for violence in our democracy. May the One who brings peace bring peace to our country.”"
