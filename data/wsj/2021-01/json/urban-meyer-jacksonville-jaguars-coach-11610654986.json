    "body": "It was just over two years ago when Urban Meyer made a declaration that approximately nobody believed.<br />“I believe I will not coach again,” he said in December 2018. “I’m certain.”<br />There was a small mountain of evidence that led essentially nobody to take him at his word. He was only 54 years old at the time. He was one of the best football coaches on the planet. And he had a history of saying he was done only to quickly change his mind: He had stepped down as the head coach at Florida in 2009 only to come back months later and resign after the next season. Less than a year later, he came back again to coach Ohio State.<br />Now Urban Meyer is nearing another comeback—this time as the coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars.<br />It isn’t exactly surprising Meyer looks like he’s returning to the sidelines. What’s surprising is the place he chose. He’s betting the next stage of a career rich with championships on a franchise that has never won a Super Bowl and had the NFL’s worst record in 2020."
