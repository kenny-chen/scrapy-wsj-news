    "body": "President Biden is set to sign executive orders Thursday directing the government to re-examine Trump-era health-care policies, which could lead to the unraveling of initiatives like Medicaid work requirements and short-term health plans.<br />But the process is likely to be long and met with legal battles.<br />Many rules or waivers approved by former President Donald Trump would require rule-making, public notice, or hearings before they could be unraveled. Some policies are already enmeshed in legal proceedings, which means the Biden administration in some cases would need to move swiftly to take action before court decisions are made.<br />States are likely to fight to preserve other Trump administration changes, such as a first-ever block grant in Tennessee that would cap federal funding for the stateâ€™s Medicaid program.<br />Mr. Biden is likely to stop short in the executive orders of calling for the policies and waivers to be gutted. The orders are expected to call for federal agencies to re-examine rules and policies that limit access to health care, including demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. Agencies will then consider whether to take additional action."
