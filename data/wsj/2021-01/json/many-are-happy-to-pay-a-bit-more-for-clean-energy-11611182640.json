    "body": "Jinjoo Lee (“Peak Oil? Not This Year. Or This Decade,” Exchange, Jan. 9) apparently decided everyone is interested in the sticker price above all else when blithely stating, “Nobody likes paying more for energy.”<br />There are many who will happily pay more—to encourage alternative sources, to put long-term impact ahead of short-term savings and to better reflect total costs associated with production, distribution, use, etc.<br />And, of course, there is an entire investment category that captures aspects of that less selfish approach—ESG (environmental, social and governance criteria).<br />C.J.
