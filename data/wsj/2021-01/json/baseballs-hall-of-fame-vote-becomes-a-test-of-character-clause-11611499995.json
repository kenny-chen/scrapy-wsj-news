    "body": "The National Baseball Hall of Fame suffered unprecedented losses over the past year, with seven members dying in 2020 and three more already passing in 2021. And with the results of the most recent election arriving this week, there’s a good chance that no new players will be inducted to replenish the ranks in Cooperstown.<br />The reason: The best candidates are failing the Hall’s character test, signaling a new era in how voters treat the most nebulous—and controversial—barrier to entry for baseball’s highest honor.<br />Eligible members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America receive Hall-of-Fame ballots every autumn instructing them to choose candidates not only based on their performance on the field, but also on their integrity, sportsmanship and character. Some variation of those words have been part of the criteria for 75 years and have caused confusion and fierce debate ever since.<br />This year has put the meaning of the “character clause” to the ultimate test. Virtually all of the players on the ballot with the most obvious Hall-worthy statistics have something on their résumés that, depending on one’s interpretation of the character clause, could disqualify them from induction into Cooperstown.<br />When vote totals are unveiled Tuesday, the result could well be that no players reach the necessary 75% for enshrinement. That would be just the fourth time since 1960 that the BBWAA failed to vote anybody into the Hall."
