    "body": "WASHINGTON—A president’s final day in office typically includes a front-row seat at the inauguration and a formal meeting with his successor. But President Trump is doing things his own way.<br />Mr. Trump has said he will not attend President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday. Instead, the president is planning to leave the White House Wednesday morning for a send-off ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, according to people familiar with the matter. He’ll then fly to Florida, where he is expected to spend much of his post-presidency.<br />The White House hasn’t publicly announced Mr. Trump’s schedule for Wednesday. But the president is expected to fly from the White House to Joint Base Andrews on Marine One on Wednesday morning.<br />At around 8 a.m., Mr. Trump is expected to participate in a ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, according to an invitation to the event reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The invitation instructs guests to wear masks. It also says invitees can bring as many as five guests.<br />More than 200 service members are expected to participate in Mr. Trump’s formal departure, which is expected to include a 21-gun salute, a color guard and other ceremonial units, U.S. officials said. Mr. Trump is likely to make remarks, officials said."
