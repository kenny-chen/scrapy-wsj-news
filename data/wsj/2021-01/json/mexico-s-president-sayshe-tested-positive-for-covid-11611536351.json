    "body": "MEXICO CITY—Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Sunday that he tested positive for Covid-19 and was receiving medical treatment for what he called mild symptoms.<br />Mr. López Obrador, 67 years old, has continued traveling around the country and attending public events even during a surge of Covid-19 infections hit the country over the past month. Mexico has suffered close to 150,000 confirmed Covid-19 deaths.<br />“As always, I’m optimistic,” he said in a tweet. “We’ll all get through this.”<br />Mr. López Obrador said that he still intends to hold a telephone call Monday morning with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to discuss Mexico’s possible acquisition of Russia’s Sputnik V Covid vaccines.<br />Mr. López Obrador said he would be keeping an eye on government matters from the National Palace in Mexico City, where he lives and conducts most of his duties. Interior Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero will preside over his morning news conferences in the meantime. Mexico doesn’t have a vice president who would formally take over duties if the president falls ill."
