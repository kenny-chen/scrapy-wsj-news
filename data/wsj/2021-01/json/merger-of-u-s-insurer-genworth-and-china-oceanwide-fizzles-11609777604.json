    "body": "China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co.’s four-year-old agreement to buy  Genworth  Financial Inc., one of the world’s longest deal engagements, is petering out.<br />Back in October 2016, Genworth agreed to sell itself to the private Chinese conglomerate for $2.7 billion in cash. But on Monday, Richmond, Va.-based insurer  Genworth  said a year-end 2020 deadline to complete the transaction with Beijing-based China Oceanwide wasn’t extended—after 16 previous extensions.<br />While the companies didn’t cancel the merger agreement, the move indicates the long-running affair could end without a marriage.<br />Genworth said one stumbling block has been the deal’s financing, which was to be partially supplied by Hony Capital, a Chinese private-equity firm. A Hony Capital representative declined to comment.<br />Genworth said the Covid-19 pandemic “and associated restrictions” also delayed the deal’s closing."
