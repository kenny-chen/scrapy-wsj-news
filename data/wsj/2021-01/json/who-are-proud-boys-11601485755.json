    "body": "The leader of the far-right Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, was arrested Monday by Washington, D.C. police and charged in connection with unrest that followed pro-Trump protests in the nation’s capital last month.<br />Metropolitan Police arrested Mr. Tarrio, 36 years old, and charged him with destruction of property related to the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner belonging to a historic Black church, a police spokesman said. Police also charged him with possession of what they said were two “high-capacity firearm magazines.”<br />The night of the burning, brawls broke out between some demonstrators supporting President Trump and counterprotesters. Several people, including eight police officers, were hurt, authorities said at the time. Four people were stabbed.<br />Mr. Tarrio’s arrest came the same day civil-rights groups filed a lawsuit against Mr. Tarrio and Proud Boys International LLC over vandalism they say the group committed at a second historic Black church in Washington.<br />The far-right group describes itself as a men’s organization for “Western chauvinists” and has often fought with left-wing activists. At pro-Trump rallies in Washington, D.C., after the election, Mr. Tarrio led his group in chants of “F— antifa!”, referring to the loose network of far-left activists who have at times engaged in violence against those they view as fascist or racist."
