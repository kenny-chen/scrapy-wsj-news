    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden introduced his leadership team for the Justice Department, including Judge Merrick Garland as his choice to be U.S. attorney general, saying his nominees would restore faith in the department and promote equal justice under the law.<br />“We need to restore the honor, the integrity, the independence of the Department of Justice in this nation that has been so badly damaged,”  Mr. Biden said at a Thursday press event in Delaware, in which he also characterized Wednesday’s rioters at the U.S. Capitol as domestic terrorists.<br />Mr. Biden alleged President Trump had broken the traditional arm’s-length relationship between the White House and the Justice Department by treating the department as his personal law firm—a criticism frequently lodged by Mr. Trump’s critics, though Justice officials didn’t always comply with the president’s desires.<br />Addressing Judge Garland and the other DOJ nominees in attendance, Mr. Biden said, “Your loyalty is not to me, it’s to the law.”<br />Judge Garland, 68 years old, is a longtime jurist on a powerful federal appeals court in Washington and a former Supreme Court nominee, as well as a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the prosecution of Theodore Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, and Timothy McVeigh, an antigovernment extremist who in 1995 blew up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people."
