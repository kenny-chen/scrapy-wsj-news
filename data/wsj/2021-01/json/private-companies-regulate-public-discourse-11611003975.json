    "body": "If Vivek Ramaswamy and Jed Rubenfeld are correct that social-media companies are state actors, the policy of a free and open internet, embodied in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, is dead (“Saving the Constitution from Big Tech,” op-ed, Jan. 12). Indeed, every communications company—broadcast TV and radio, cable and satellite TV and radio, cellular carriers, app makers, news organizations—would always be state actors, because all of them are subject to carrots and sticks under different regulatory regimes. Through the fiat of a judicially created extension of the state-action doctrine to these private actors, Messrs. Ramaswamy and Rubenfeld’s position would effectively nationalize the American media ecosystem. We might agree that the balance of regulatory carrots and sticks for big social-media companies is out of whack, but surely nationalizing the entire infosphere isn’t the answer.<br />Prof. David W.
