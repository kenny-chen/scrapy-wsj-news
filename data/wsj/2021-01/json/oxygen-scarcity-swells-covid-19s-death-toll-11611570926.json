    "body": "Thalita Rocha Lima was visiting a crowded Covid-19 ward this month in Manaus, the biggest Brazilian city in the Amazon, when her mother-in-law Maria and other patients suddenly became agitated, breaking out in sweat and gasping for air as their fingertips turned purple.<br />“I ran over to check the equipment and that’s when I realized: There was no oxygen left,” said Ms. Rocha Lima, who rushed out into the corridor yelling, “They’re going to die.”<br />The hospital’s director informed her that the hospital had run out of oxygen and didn’t know when it would get more, she said. Her mother-in-law, a 67-year-old retired nurse, suffocated about 14 hours after the oxygen ran out, along with others in her ward, Ms. Rocha Lima said.<br />As Covid-19 cases increase sharply in much of the world, a scarcity of oxygen is forcing hospitals to ration it for patients and is driving up the coronavirus pandemic’s death toll. The problem is especially acute in the developing world, but has also hit hospitals in London and Los Angeles.<br />From Brazil to Zambia, overcrowded hospitals with too few resources are calling for emergency resupplies of oxygen. In Mexico and South Africa, people are stockpiling oxygen canisters to try to avoid overflowing Covid-19 wards, sending prices higher and making it harder for poorer families to rent tanks. In Mexico, armed bandits are stealing oxygen tanks."
