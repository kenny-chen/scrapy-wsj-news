    "body": "The South is leading the U.S. labor market’s recovery from the pandemic’s initial shock as the only major region with continued payroll growth at the end of last year while the rest of the country lost jobs.<br />Southern states logged job growth across the private sector in December, including services industries, which were hit hard by the pandemic, and manufacturing, according to a Labor Department report that provides details on the job market in all 50 states. Texas and Georgia gained the most jobs in December, adding a seasonally adjusted 64,200 and 44,700 jobs, respectively.<br />In contrast, payrolls in the Midwest, West and Northeast fell last month, when the nation’s total payrolls slipped by 140,000 for the first decline in seven months.<br />In those parts of the country, a surge in virus infections, related restrictions and winter weather prompted steep job cuts in leisure and hospitality industries, which includes restaurants. In the South, those jobs held nearly steady.<br />The South’s milder winter weather makes it easier to dine outside or participate in other outdoors activities, said Mark Vitner, a Charlotte, N.C.-based economist at Wells Fargo Securities. More lenient public health regulations that have kept businesses open have also had an impact."
