    "body": "Private equity giant  Blackstone  Group Inc. has agreed to buy  Allstate  Life Insurance Co. from Allstate Corp. for $2.8 billion, the latest in a slew of deals between financial firms and life insurance businesses.<br />Allstate Life Insurance Co. holds about 80%, or $23 billion, of Allstate’s life and annuity reserves. The companies expect to close the deal in the second half of the year.<br />\"We’re pleased to enter into this transaction as Blackstone continues growing its insurance business,” said Gilles Dellaert, global head of Blackstone Insurance Solutions, in a statement.<br />Financial firms have been on a tear buying up life insurance and annuities businesses. Last week, Sixth Street Partners announced a deal to buy life insurance business Talcott Resolution for $2 billion.<br />Since the world-wide financial crisis of 2008, private-equity, asset-management and other types of financial firms have bought up blocks of life-insurance policies and annuities, and even entire operating units, as insurers narrowed their focus and divested product lines. Ultralow interest rates have prompted much of the activity, hurting insurers’ profits."
