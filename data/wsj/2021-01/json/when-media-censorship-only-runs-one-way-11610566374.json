    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Progressive Purge Begins” (Jan. 11): President Xi Jinping of the Chinese Communist Party shuts down Google,  Facebook  and  Twitter  in China, blocking information to 1.4 billion people. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey closes the sitting president’s account, blocking information to his 88 million direct followers plus countless others via redistribution.  Amazon  blocks books based on their authors’ political viewpoint. Google and Apple block Parler. Twitter blocked the New York Post, though they later relented. What master are they serving?<br />Has House Speaker Nancy Pelosi considered that President Trump’s 88 million Twitter followers is a larger group than the 81 million-plus Joe Biden voters?<br />Bill Ragsdale<br />Woodland, Calif.<br />"
