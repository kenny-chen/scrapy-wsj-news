    "body": "After a year of startling growth, the tech industry faces a more vexing 2021.<br />The pandemic helped bring the world’s tech giants such as  Amazon.com Inc.  and  Microsoft Corp.  to new heights in 2020. The shift to online shopping and remote working accelerated at a pace that would have been inconceivable without the coronavirus.<br />But there are signs the good times may end soon.
