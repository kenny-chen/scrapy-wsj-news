    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R., Ga.) conceded defeat to her Democratic challenger, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, in one of the two Georgia Senate runoffs, accepting election results that showed he had won more votes a day after the AP declared him the winner.<br />“Unfortunately, we came up slightly short in the runoff election—and earlier today I called Rev. Warnock to congratulate him and to wish him well in serving this great state,” Ms. Loeffler told supporters in a video released by her campaign Thursday evening.<br />Ms. Loeffler pledged to continue fighting for conservative values and against “the radical agenda of the left.”<br />“I fully intend to stay in this fight for freedom, for our values, and for the future of this great country,” she said.<br />Ms. Loeffler—appointed last year to fill a Senate seat vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson, who retired due to illness—ran in a special election against Mr. Warnock, the pastor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s former church in Atlanta, to finish two years of that term."
