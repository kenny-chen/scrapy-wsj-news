    "body": "Factories in Asia and Europe increased their output as 2020 drew to a close, aided by a revival in trade that has continued despite a sharp rise in new coronavirus infections across many large economies.<br />The resilience of the global manufacturing sector contrasts with weakness in services businesses that rely on close physical proximity, and which have suffered as consumers try to lower their risk of infection and governments impose restrictions on their behavior.<br />Economists expect that divergence to be a feature of the global economy well into 2021, and until vaccines are distributed broadly enough to ensure widespread immunity against Covid-19.<br />Surveys of purchasing managers at factories across Asia and Europe that were released Monday recorded strong rises in activity during December, with Taiwan’s manufacturing sector recording its strongest month in almost a decade. The results of a similar survey of U.S. manufacturers, to be released later Monday, are expected to also point to a strong increase in activity.<br />While Europe has seen a rise in infections that will likely prompt governments to extend current restrictions, its manufacturers continued to report a recovery from the sharp declines in output that accompanied the pandemic’s first wave and the lockdowns that accompanied it."
