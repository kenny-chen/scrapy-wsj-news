    "body": "Of all the big questions hanging over the early days of President Biden’s administration, none looms larger than this: Can he hold the political center, or will he be pulled away from it toward the left?<br />In his first week, the evidence is mixed. The safest conclusion to draw is that it is too early to draw a conclusion.<br />Mr. Biden, of course, campaigned as a centrist in a party that generally has moved to the left. “Biden won the nomination because he’s a moderate, not despite it,” says Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, an organization of centrist Democrats. “And he won the election as a moderate.”<br />Some Republicans, though, argue that Mr. Biden already has abandoned that center ground in his early actions and initiatives. “Some of these are far left-of-center ideas,” asserted Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida on Fox News Sunday. “He may use the language, the rhetoric, even the demeanor of a centrist, but so far his policies don’t seem to represent that.”<br />As evidence, Republicans cite Mr. Biden’s unprecedented burst of executive orders reversing Trump administration policies, including on immigration, gender identity in schools and transgender people in the military; the hefty $1.9 trillion price tag on his proposed coronavirus aid and stimulus plan; his inclusion of a $15 minimum wage proposal within that plan; his immediate decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada’s oil-sands region; and his appointment of some aggressive financial regulators."
