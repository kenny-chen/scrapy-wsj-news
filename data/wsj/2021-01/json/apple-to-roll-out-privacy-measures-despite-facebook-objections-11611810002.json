    "body": "Apple Inc.  plans to roll out its extensive new privacy-protection options for users over the next several months, moving ahead with plans that have ratcheted up tensions between the company and social-media giant  Facebook Inc.<br />On the same day Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors Apple poses a growing threat to its business, the iPhone maker reiterated its intent to give users the option to limit how apps track their digital footprints.<br />Apple users early this spring will see the new feature, which will allow ad tracking only if consumers opt in once they receive a prompt on an iPhone or iPad. (A beta version will be coming sooner for test users.)<br />The software update to its mobile operating system would make it so that Facebook or other companies would no longer be able to collect a personâ€™s advertising identifier without permission.<br />Chief Executive Tim Cook is slated to speak Thursday on the topic of data privacy at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference."
