    "body": "Chaa Loftin applied to more than 100 different jobs last year while completing his computer science bachelor’s degree at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.<br />Exactly zero of those résumés went to startups, though he would soon have exactly the kind of STEM degree such companies seek out. He didn’t like the idea of high turnover rates or gambling on an untested venture amid the uncertainty of the pandemic. Instead, he starts this month as a software engineer at  IBM ,  founded in 1911.<br />“One of the most important things I was looking for in a company is the tenure of its employees,” the 27-year-old says. “At IBM, it tends to be around the five-to-seven year mark, and when I spoke with upper-level management, they discussed possible career paths for me and really emphasized growth within the company, which for me, as a millennial, is really important.”<br />Startup jobs in industries from payments to social media have become steadily more popular, says Lisa Cohen, an associate professor at McGill University’s business school who studies startups. Many young workers fantasize about getting in early at, say, the next  Facebook ,  tantalized by the rewards that come when a sink-or-swim enterprise proves itself viable.<br />But that allure was severely tested in a year dominated by the pandemic, which has thrown the economy into tumult and increased the desire of job seekers like Mr. Loftin for stability."
