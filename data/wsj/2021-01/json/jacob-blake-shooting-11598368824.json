    "body": "The county prosecutor in Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday decided not to bring charges against the officer who shot Jacob Blake seven times on Aug. 23, a shooting that sparked weeks of protest and violent unrest in the small city on the shores of Lake Michigan.<br />The shooting came to light in a viral video showing the last moments of the encounter. On Tuesday, prosecutors painted a much different picture when they explained their decision not to bring charges against Officer Rusten Sheskey, who is white, or Mr. Blake, who is Black.<br />The video shows Mr. Blake in a scuffle with police behind the car, then walking around to the front with officers trailing him, guns drawn. They can be heard ordering him to “drop the knife,” repeatedly, but it isn’t clear in the video whether Mr. Blake is holding a blade.<br />It then shows Mr. Blake opening the driver’s side door, and starting to get into the car, as an officer grabs his tank top and then fires multiple shots toward his back.<br />Prosecutors showed an enhanced video clip at a press briefing on Tuesday in which a dark object can be seen in a few frames in Mr. Blake’s hand. They said the shape matches that of the razorblade type knife found on the floorboards of the car. They also said Mr. Blake admitted to having the knife in his possession and switching it from his left hand to his right so he could open the door."
