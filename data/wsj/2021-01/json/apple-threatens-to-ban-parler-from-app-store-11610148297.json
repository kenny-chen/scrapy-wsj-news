    "body": "Apple Inc.  has threatened to ban Parler, a free-speech focused social-media network favored by conservatives, for failing to moderate incitements to violence and illegal activity, according to a notice provided to The Wall Street Journal by John Matze, Parler’s chief executive.<br />“We have received numerous complaints regarding objectionable content in your Parler service, accusations that the Parler App was used to plan, coordinate and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington DC on January 6,” the notice begins. The tech giant said in order for Parler to remain available in the App Store, it had to provide detailed information on its content-moderation plans and “what you will do to improve moderation and content filtering your service for this kind of objectionable content going forward.”<br />Apple set a deadline of 24 hours for Parler’s compliance.<br />Launched in 2018, Parler has billed itself as a free-speech friendly and content-recommendation free alternative to larger social networks such as  Facebook  and  Twitter .  It has exploded in popularity in the run-up to and after the 2020 U.S. presidential election<br />While Parler bans spam, threats of violence and other illegal activity, its rules don’t prohibit hate speech and false information."
