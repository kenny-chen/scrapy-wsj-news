    "body": "<br /><br />Fans of jazz and improvised music remain stuck in a challenging period of estrangement—from shared and spontaneous invention, and from a familiar sense of communion among musicians, audience members and the spirits that lurk in clubs such as Manhattan’s Village Vanguard.<br />The Vanguard, Greenwich Village’s jazz temple, soldiers on, offering livestreamed performances from the stage of its otherwise empty club. (Thumbscrew, featuring guitarist Mary Halvorson, bassist Michael Formanek and drummer Tomas Fujiawara, will perform Jan. 15 and 16. Guitarist Peter Bernstein, the last musician to headline the club before the Covid-19 lockdown, leads his quartet Jan. 29 and 30.) Yet the infrastructure for such presentations is now endangered. The Jazz Standard, long among New York’s best jazz venues, closed in early December; earlier this month, Birdland, another Manhattan landmark, established a GoFundMe campaign in an effort to remain afloat.<br />Still, during this trying time, presenters and musicians have begun to enrich our virtual lives with fresh insights into repertoire and the creative process itself."
