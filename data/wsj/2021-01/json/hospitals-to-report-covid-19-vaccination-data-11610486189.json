    "body": "The Health and Human Services Department will start collecting hospital data on how many health-care personnel and patients have gotten Covid-19 vaccines amid a faltering national push to widely and quickly immunize the public.<br />The agency on Tuesday unveiled the change that asks hospitals to report once a week on progress immunizing health-care personnel and patients. Data won’t initially be made public for individual hospitals, according to senior HHS officials. HHS expects to make the data public after verifying its quality, they said.<br />Hospital workers were among the first to be immunized from the limited early U.S. supply of vaccines because of their exposure to the virus and critical work. But the national rollout of vaccines has been slow and rocky. Hospitals largely haven’t mandated workers get the vaccine. Surveys show not all personnel are willing to be immunized.<br />Vaccinations through the end of last year reached about 2.8 million administered doses, far less than the federal goal of 20 million.<br />The Trump administration said Tuesday it would release additional vaccine supplies, and called for immunization of adults older than 65 and those with health issues that put them at risk. The extra vaccines are doses that had been set aside as the second of the two required shots."
