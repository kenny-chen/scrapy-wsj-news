    "body": "What’s interesting about the House’s recent adoption of gender-neutral language in its new rules (Notable & Quotable, Jan. 5) is that the tendency in recent years has been to slice identity into finer and finer segments meant to bring to light the power relations inherent in the point of view from which an individual understands the world. The House’s new speech codes, however, seem to be reversing course by collapsing what were once distinct identities into overly broad categories that deny individuals the right to define themselves as they please. The tension between these two trends is palpable.<br />Grace M. Burton<br />Ballston Spa, N.Y.<br /><br />Under the new Democratic House rules, “uncle” and “aunt” become “parent’s siblings” to be gender neutral. What? So much for Uncle Sam."
