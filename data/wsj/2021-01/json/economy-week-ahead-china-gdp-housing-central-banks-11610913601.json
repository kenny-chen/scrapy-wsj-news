    "body": "China’s economic growth figures for 2020 will likely underscore the country’s rebound from the pandemic and provide a contrast with more muted signals from the U.S. and other Western economies.<br />Monday<br />China’s economy is expected to gather steam in the final quarter of the year, with gross domestic product expanding 6% from a year earlier, compared with 4% in the third quarter. That will likely take growth in the pandemic-ravaged year to 2.2%—significantly lower than in 2019 but still leaving it the only major economy to advance in 2020.<br />Wednesday<br />Joe Biden is scheduled to be sworn in as president. Mr. Biden last week called for a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan to help Americans weather the economic shock of the pandemic and pump more money into testing and vaccine distribution."
