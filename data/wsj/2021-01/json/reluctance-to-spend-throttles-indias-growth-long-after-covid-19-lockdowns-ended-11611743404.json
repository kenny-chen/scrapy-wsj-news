    "body": "NEW DELHI—Most Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted as cases have plunged, but Indians are still stashing away their rupees and building bank balances.<br />New Delhi maid Sarita Ekka has the beginnings of an impressive trousseau stacked in a corner of her humble home: a new juicer, sandwich grill, pots, utensils, 15 saris and a full set of gold jewelry.<br />Last year she stopped shopping and put off wedding plans to build her safety net as Covid-19 constricted opportunities and income.<br />“Marriage can wait. I’m saving for Covid emergencies,” she said. “What if I lose my job? What if I have a medical emergency? Life is more important than these things.”<br />Consumers like Ms. Ekka are the main engine of growth in the world’s fifth-largest economy. Their willingness to spend will set the course of the recovery."
