    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House sent over the article of impeachment of former President Donald Trump to the Senate Monday evening, officially starting the countdown to a trial expected to highlight the rifts within the GOP over Mr. Trump’s legacy and his future influence over the party.<br />The House impeachment managers, who will act as the prosecutors in Mr. Trump’s second impeachment trial, walked through the Capitol to deliver the article, which alleges he incited a mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />The proceedings leading up to the trial in the Senate, where a two-thirds supermajority will be needed to convict Mr. Trump, coincide with a moment of intense internal wrestling within the Republican Party. Some GOP lawmakers have criticized Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and actions and called on the party to change direction, while loyalists to Mr. Trump have sought to keep Republicans in line behind the former president, who is popular with the party’s base.<br />“There is only one question at stake, only one question, that senators of both parties will have to answer before God and their own conscience,” said Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y) on the floor of the Senate.  “Is former President Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection against the United States?”<br />Spokespeople for Mr. Trump didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment."
