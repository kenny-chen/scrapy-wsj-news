    "body": "Boeing Co.  reported its biggest-ever annual loss and took a big financial hit on its new 777X jetliner, reflecting the pandemic’s worsening toll on the plane maker.<br />The write-down comes just as the 737 MAX re-enters service and Boeing tries to recover from a series of botched jetliner and military programs that more than halved its market value over the past two years. That was even before the coronavirus pandemic brought a decadelong boom in aircraft sales to a halt, prompting the company to shed 31,000 jobs.<br />The company took a $6.5 billion pretax charge on the 777X to reflect lower profits over the life of the wide-body plane that is now expected to enter service in 2023, three years late. Airlines have shied away from big jets like the 777X as international travel demand collapsed.<br />Boeing’s fourth-quarter loss lifted its annual deficit to $11.94 billion, with sales for the year slipping 24% to $58.2 billion. That dropped Boeing to fourth spot by that measure behind  Raytheon Technologies Corp. ,  Lockheed Martin Corp.  and  Airbus SE .<br />Chicago-based Boeing didn’t provide any financial guidance on Wednesday. Analysts expect sales to increase this year with the resumption of 787 deliveries following quality problems that halted customers taking any new jets since October."
