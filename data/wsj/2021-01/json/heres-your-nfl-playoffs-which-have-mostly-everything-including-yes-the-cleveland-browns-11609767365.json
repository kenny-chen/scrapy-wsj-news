    "body": "It was a game so painful to watch, my eyeballs may need to go on injured reserve—Washington edged the barely-there, comically-disengaged, Bartleby-the-Football-Coach Philadelphia Eagles Sunday night, capturing the somebody’s-gotta-win-it NFC East with a hardy 7-9 record, and slink into the NFL’s last playoff spot like a wedding guest without a present or shoes.<br />Washington will host Florida man Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next Sunday in the Maryland ‘burbs.<br />Also in the NFC postseason party: Green Bay, New Orleans, Seattle, the Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears.<br />In the AFC, it’s the defending Super Bowl champions Kansas City, the Buffalo Freaking Bills—hosting a playoff game in Buffalo for the first time since 1996—Pittsburgh, Tennessee, Baltimore, and a frisky Indianapolis outfit.<br />And I think that’s it."
