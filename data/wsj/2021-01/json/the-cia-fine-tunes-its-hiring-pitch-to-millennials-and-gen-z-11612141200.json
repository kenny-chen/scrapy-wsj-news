    "body": "Recruitment was a clubby affair in the earliest years of the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA, founded in 1947, scoured Ivy League campuses and elite East Coast social circles to find promising young men (and a handful of women) to fill out its ranks at home and abroad.<br />Today, the agency is turning to more public tools in a hiring push to expand and diversify its ranks. It runs video advertisements, has an Instagram account, and posts job openings on LinkedIn. It even launched a splashy new website in January whose content includes an advice column and dog-training tips, plus a bold new black-and-white logo.<br />The CIA hopes these efforts will convince the millions of millennials and Gen-Zers scrolling through their phones and streaming TV to consider a career in intelligence.<br />“We had to go where the talent is,” says Sheronda Dorsey, the CIA’s deputy associate director for talent, who is now on LinkedIn herself.<br />The agency has always relied on a steady influx of young people, especially recent college graduates, but has periodically faced challenges hiring them. Students frequently protested on-campus CIA recruiters in the 1960s, for instance."
