    "body": "The things that have kept inflation low during the Covid-19 crisis are a lot different than the ones that used to keep it low. A whipsawing of prices when the pandemic passes is something to look out for.<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that U.S. consumer prices rose 0.4% in December from November, putting them 1.4% above their year earlier level. Core prices, which exclude food and energy items to better capture inflation’s trend, rose 0.1% from November, and were up 1.6% on the year.<br />The Federal Reserve’s aim is for 2% inflation, and the consumer price measures it follows run cooler than the Labor Department’s.<br />Under inflation’s hood, though, there are some big shifts. Prices for food at home—groceries and the like—remain elevated as a result of the pandemic, and were up 3.9% in December from a year earlier. Meanwhile, prices for lodging at hotels and the like were down 11.2%.<br />Those are reflections of a broader trend in which goods prices have risen on the back of stronger demand during the pandemic while services inflation has cooled substantially. Core goods prices were up 1.7% on the year last month, which compared with a December 2019 gain of 0.1%. Core services prices were up 1.6%, which compared with a December 2019 gain of 3%."
