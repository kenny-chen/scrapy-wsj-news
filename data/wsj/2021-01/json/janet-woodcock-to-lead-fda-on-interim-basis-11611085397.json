    "body": "WASHINGTON—Janet Woodcock, who has led the Food and Drug Administration’s drug review efforts for years, is slated to oversee the agency on an interim basis after current Commissioner Stephen Hahn leaves Wednesday.<br />President-elect Joe Biden has yet to nominate an FDA commissioner. Dr. Hahn has designated Dr. Woodcock as interim commissioner at least until a permanent commissioner is nominated and confirmed, a designation that is expected to be seconded Wednesday by the Biden transition team.<br />Dr. Woodcock joined the FDA in 1986, and has most recently overseen the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. During the past year, she has been on detail to the drug portion of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s multi-agency task force to speed the development of Covid-19-related drugs and other medical products.<br />The Biden transition team didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the FDA post, and Dr. Woodcock declined to comment.<br />Dr. Hahn is stepping down after a tumultuous tenure in which his agency was regularly attacked by President Trump, who claimed it didn’t move quickly enough to expedite approval of a Covid-19 vaccine."
