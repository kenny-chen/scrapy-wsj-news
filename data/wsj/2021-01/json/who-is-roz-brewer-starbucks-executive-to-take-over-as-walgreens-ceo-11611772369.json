    "body": "When Rosalind Brewer, then the CEO of Sam’s Club, called out the lack of diversity in American corporations in a 2015 interview, she received death threats and a torrent of criticism.<br />Five years later, Ms. Brewer, now  Starbucks Corp.’s  No. 2 executive, is set to become the only Black woman to lead a Fortune 500 company as she takes over as chief executive of  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  amid a national debate about systemic racism.<br />Walgreens ,  the largest U.S. drugstore chain by sales, said Tuesday that Ms. Brewer, who goes by Roz, will succeed Stefano Pessina, who will stay on the company’s board and serve as its executive chairman.<br />Mr. Pessina said Ms. Brewer, 58, became a CEO candidate through a search run by an outside firm, and that he and Ms. Brewer talked one-on-one several times in recent weeks.<br />“What I see in her is leadership,” said Mr. Pessina, who has run Walgreens since mid-2015. “Initially you have to trust your gut feeling and my gut feeling was good. I liked her, otherwise we probably wouldn’t be here today.”"
