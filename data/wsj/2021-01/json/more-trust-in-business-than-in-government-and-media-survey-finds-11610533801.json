    "body": "People have more faith in their own employer than leaders in government and business, according to a new study released Wednesday.<br />Overall, trust in institutions remains low, but business earned the highest marks, said the annual survey by the public-relations firm Edelman. The poll represented the company’s 21st analysis of public trust in major institutions and surveyed more than 33,000 people in 28 countries over the past several months.<br />More than half of U.S. respondents, 54%, said they trust business, which was more than was said for nongovernmental organizations, government or media. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. respondents said their own employer, in particular, was a mainstay of trust.<br />“Business has to help the country knit itself back together, to be the connective tissue, while the politics are sorted out,” said Richard Edelman, the company’s chief executive.<br />The findings continue a trend. Last year’s poll also showed crumbling trust in institutions amid anxiety about corruption, future employment prospects and the wage gap between the rich and middle classes."
