    "body": "While we appreciate the editorial board’s feedback on the draft statement about financing a U.S. transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy, many investors, clients and organizations in the free market disagree with your view (“Banks Make a Climate Offering,” Jan. 13).<br />Over the last decade, consumer preferences and investor demands have shaped the need for financial products that reduce climate-related risks. As a result, many of our member banks, asset managers, insurers and other financial intermediaries have already responded to that demand.<br />Mounting climate risks to our global infrastructure and financial systems further demand a significant shift in where, and how, the financial sector deploys resources, expertise and capital.<br />Rather than ignore these signals and science, we need a road map for the future, and a collective voice to further efforts that drive the transition to a more sustainable, low-carbon growth model.<br />As stewards of free markets, we hope that in time you’ll see the efficiency and efficacy of a market-based approach to address what is the great challenge of our time."
