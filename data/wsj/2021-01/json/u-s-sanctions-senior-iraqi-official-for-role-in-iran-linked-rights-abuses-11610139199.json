    "body": "The U.S. imposed sanctions Friday on a senior Iraqi official for his link to human-rights abuses by Iran-backed militias, as the Trump administration continues its campaign to isolate Tehran during the president’s final weeks in office.<br />The official, Faleh al-Fayyadh, is chairman of the Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella for several dozen Iraqi paramilitary groups including powerful factions with close ideological and operational ties to Tehran.<br />He is the most senior Iraqi official to be blacklisted by Washington, which has deployed sanctions in its efforts to curb Iran’s influence in Iraq and the region.<br />Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Mr. Fayyadh was part of a crisis cell comprised primarily of militia leaders formed in late 2019 to suppress antigovernment protests with the support of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.<br />Weeks before the protests broke out, Mr. Fayyadh had been invited to Washington, where he met with then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper."
