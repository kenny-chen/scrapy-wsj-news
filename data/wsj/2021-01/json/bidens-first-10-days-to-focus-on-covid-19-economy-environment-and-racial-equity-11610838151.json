    "body": "WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team is outlining plans to reverse many of President Trump’s policies during the first 10 days of the new administration, including a flurry of executive actions focused on Covid-19, the economy and climate change.<br />Ron Klain, Mr. Biden’s incoming chief of staff, said in a memo released Saturday that the White House would address “four overlapping and compounding crises,” covering the pandemic, the economy, the environment and racial equity.<br />The memo offered the most detailed rundown to date of how Mr. Biden envisions the start of his presidency which Mr. Klain said would be used to “address these four crises, prevent urgent and irreversible harms, and restore America’s place in the world.”<br />The memo makes no mention of Mr. Trump’s second impeachment last week but indicates how the new president will use his executive authority to build momentum even as the Senate may be conducting an impeachment trial during the period.<br />The executive actions cover a range of issues from Mr. Biden’s campaign agenda. The former vice president released a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal, and Mr. Klain said Mr. Biden would soon unveil legislation related to immigration, economic recovery, voting rights and fighting violence against women."
