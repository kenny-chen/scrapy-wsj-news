Missiles will get smaller and lighter. Others will fly farther.<br />A hypersonic warhead, which generally can travel a mile per second, is ready for testing and production, he said. The guidance technology for a multi-warhead rocket, presumed to be for an intercontinental ballistic missile, is at its final stage.<br />At a Thursday night military parade celebrating the Workers’ Party meeting, the North put a host of military hardware on display, including a submarine-launched ballistic missile that state media touted as the “world’s most powerful weapon.”"
