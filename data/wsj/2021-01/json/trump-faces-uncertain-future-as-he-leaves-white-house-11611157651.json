    "body": "WASHINGTON—Donald Trump began his presidency as a Washington outsider and is ending it as one, with his future political prospects and influence diminished by his unsuccessful campaign to overturn his election loss.<br />Polls indicate that Mr. Trump leaves office retaining strong support among rank-and-file Republicans. But he has alienated several of his closest allies after urging protesters to march on the Capitol in what became a violent riot, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), Vice President Mike Pence and at least two of his cabinet members who resigned in protest.<br />Mr. Trump on Wednesday became one of only a handful of presidents to skip his successor’s inauguration.<br />Instead, with the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.” blaring, he boarded a plane early Wednesday morning for Florida, where he is set to spend his post-presidency life at the Mar-a-Lago resort that he once dubbed the “Southern White House.” He left a note for his successor before leaving; a spokesman declined to say what it said.<br />“We will be back in some form,” Mr. Trump vowed in his final remarks as president, at an event that included more than 200 service members, a 21-gun salute, a color guard and other ceremonial units. He said he wished the new administration “great luck and success” and added: “I hope they don’t raise your taxes, but if they do—I told you so.”"
