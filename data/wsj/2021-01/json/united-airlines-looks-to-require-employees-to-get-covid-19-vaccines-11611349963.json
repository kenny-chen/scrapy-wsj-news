    "body": "United Airlines Holdings Inc.  wants to require its workers to get Covid-19 vaccines, Chief Executive Scott Kirby told employees on Thursday, though he cautioned there are logistical hurdles to implementing such a mandate.<br />The head of one of the largest U.S. airlines said United would be among the first wave of companies to require vaccines, if other companies follow.<br />“Because I have confidence in the safety of the vaccine—and I recognize it’s controversial—I think the right thing to do is for United Airlines, and for other companies, to require the vaccines and to make them mandatory,” he said. His comments were reported earlier by CNBC.<br />Mr. Kirby is one of the first corporate leaders to take such a position and called on other companies to follow.<br />“I don’t think United will get away with and can realistically be the only company that requires vaccines and makes them mandatory,” he said."
