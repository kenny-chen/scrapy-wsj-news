    "body": "U.S. stock futures held on to their gains Friday following the U.S. report that the country lost 140,000 jobs in December.<br />The unemployment rate was 6.7%, ending seven months of job growth and suggesting the economy is weakening.<br />Still, the futures suggest the major benchmarks are on track for a second week of gains as they climb to record levels.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked 0.4% higher, a day after the broad-market index notched its first all-time closing high of 2021. Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.6%, and those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.3%.<br />Stocks have rallied this week despite the political unrest in Washington. Investors have largely focused on prospects for additional government spending by President-elect Joe Bidenâ€™s administration after Democrats won both Senate seats in Georgia. The fresh stimulus measures are expected to provide crucial support to American households and businesses as the coronavirus pandemic restricts work and social activity in the winter months."
