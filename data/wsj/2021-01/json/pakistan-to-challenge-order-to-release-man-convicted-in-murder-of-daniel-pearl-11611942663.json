    "body": "ISLAMABAD—Pakistan will try to keep in prison the man previously convicted of the 2002 kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, the country’s attorney general said, as the government challenges a court order for his release.<br />“We will make all efforts to see he doesn’t come out and the judgment is recalled,” Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan said in an interview Friday. “All legal options are to be explored.”<br />Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a lower-court ruling that overturned terrorism and murder convictions for Omar Sheikh, who has spent more than 18 years in prison for the crimes. The Supreme Court judges also overturned a third conviction, for kidnapping.<br />The court said it would explain its reasoning at a later date and ordered that he be set free from prison immediately if not wanted in any other case.<br />Washington and the Pearl family called on Pakistan to act swiftly to keep Mr. Sheikh behind bars. American officials also said Thursday that they were ready to take him to stand trial in the U.S. Mr. Sheikh, a British citizen, has been in prison since he was convicted in 2002 of kidnapping for ransom, terrorism and murder, and sentenced to death."
