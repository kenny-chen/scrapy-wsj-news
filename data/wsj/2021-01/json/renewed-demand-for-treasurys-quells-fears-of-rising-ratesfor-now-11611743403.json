    "body": "A sharp climb in U.S. government bond yields has stalled, easing investors’ concerns that rising rates could undercut recent gains in riskier assets.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note has hovered just above 1% for the past nine sessions after jumping from around 0.9% to almost 1.2% in just six days of trading.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, vaulted higher on Jan. 6 when Democrats won two pivotal Senate elections, securing control of the chamber. That boosted investors’ expectations for government spending—which can weigh on bonds by leading to a larger supply of Treasurys—as well as economic growth and inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds’ fixed payments.<br />A $38 billion auction of 10-year notes on Jan. 12 posed a key test of the market. Yields had breached levels not seen since early in the pandemic and were rising quickly, with investors unsure about where they were heading. A poorly received auction could have added to the selling. Instead, it met strong demand, as did a 30-year bond auction the next day, and yields quickly steadied.<br />“A lot of people were kind of saying, ‘OK, well, how far does this go?’” said Blake Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy at NatWest Markets. “Then when we got these strong auctions, that was a clear sign that, ‘OK, there’s demand somewhere.’”"
