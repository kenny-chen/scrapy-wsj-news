    "body": "A third night of riots gripped several large Dutch cities on Monday after protests against a new curfew to curb the spread of coronavirus turned violent, further complicating the Covid-19 crisis management by a beleaguered government.<br />Some 150 people were arrested and one policeman was injured in Monday’s clashes, in addition to 250 arrests made Sunday, authorities said. Looters raided shops, set cars ablaze and threw bicycles onto bonfires, pelting riot police with stones and fireworks in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, the Hague and several other cities.<br />The curfew, introduced Saturday, initially prompted peaceful but unauthorized demonstrations over the weekend in Amsterdam and other cities. Later, groups of mostly young men returned to public squares in several cities, prompting rioting and looting. Police deployed mounted units, tear gas and water cannons in Amsterdam to disperse crowds.<br />On Sunday night in Urk, a small town north of Amsterdam, rioters set a coronavirus testing center on fire.<br />Prime Minister Mark Rutte condemned the violence and said perpetrators will be prosecuted. “Any normal person will look at this with disgust and ask themselves what had gotten into these people,” he said. “This has nothing to do with protesting: It is criminal violence and we will treat it as such.”"
