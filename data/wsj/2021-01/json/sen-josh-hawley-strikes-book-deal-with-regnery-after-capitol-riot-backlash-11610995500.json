    "body": "Conservative book publisher Regnery Publishing said it would release Sen. Josh Hawley’s “The Tyranny of Big Tech,” after Simon & Schuster canceled its deal with the lawmaker over his role in the events at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />Regnery said it would publish the book on May 4. Sen. Hawley, a Missouri Republican, was a leader among the members of Congress who objected to certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.<br />Simon & Schuster, the book-publishing arm of  ViacomCBS Inc.,  terminated its deal with Sen. Hawley after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />Thomas Spence, Regnery’s president and publisher, said he reached out to Sen. Hawley through another Regnery author and that an agreement was reached quickly.<br />“We have a long tradition of publishing authors some of the mainstream publishers prefer to ignore,” Mr. Spence said. “My expectation is the book will get additional attention.”"
