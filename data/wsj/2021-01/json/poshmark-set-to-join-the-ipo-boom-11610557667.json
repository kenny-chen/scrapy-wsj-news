    "body": "<br />Poshmark Inc.,  the online marketplace for secondhand goods, is set to go public as early as Thursday, the latest e-commerce site to tap the buoyant initial public offering market as the coronavirus pandemic continues to squeeze bricks-and-mortar stores.<br />A number of digital marketplaces, including Poshmark, reported more people selling goods in spring 2020 as a way to generate extra income and stave off boredom during widespread lockdowns. Poshmark sellers list everything from $17 reusable Starbucks cups to $3,000 Louis Vuitton handbags. While many traditional apparel companies struggled to survive, Poshmark was profitable for the first time in its 10-year history during the quarter that ended June 30.<br />Poshmark is expected to price its IPO on Wednesday. It has set a price range of $35 to $39, giving the company a valuation of roughly $2.7 billion at the midpoint of that range. The business was valued atÂ $1.25 billion in 2019. Poshmark declined to comment, citing a regulatory quiet period ahead of its IPO.<br />The Redwood City, Calif.-based company follows  ContextLogic Inc.,  the parent of e-commerce marketplace Wish, which has traded below its IPO price of $24 after a rocky debut last month. The investor skepticism is an anomaly in an otherwise booming IPO market that has seen sky-high valuations and large gains from tech companies including  Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc."
