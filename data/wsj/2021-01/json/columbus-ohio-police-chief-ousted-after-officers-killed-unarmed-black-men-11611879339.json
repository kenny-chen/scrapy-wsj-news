    "body": "The mayor of Columbus, Ohio, ousted the city’s police chief Thursday, citing a failure to implement changes at the department and a citywide loss in confidence.<br />Mayor Andrew Ginther’s decision to ask Chief Thomas Quinlan to leave his post comes after law enforcement killed two unarmed Black men in Columbus in recent months. The city’s police department has also been criticized for using tear gas and chemical irritants on demonstrators this summer who were protesting the police killing of George Floyd.<br />“Columbus residents have lost faith in him,” Mr. Ginther said in a video statement. “He agreed to step back so the city can move forward.”<br />The mayor has pressed Chief Quinlan to change the city’s approach to policing following Mr. Floyd’s killing on Memorial Day weekend in Minneapolis last year.<br />Columbus voters in November approved the establishment of a civilian review board for police."
