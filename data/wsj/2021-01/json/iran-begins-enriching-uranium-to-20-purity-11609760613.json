    "body": "TEHRAN—Iran said Monday it has resumed enriching uranium to 20% purity, a significant breach of the 2015 nuclear deal that slashes the time it would take for Tehran to produce the grade of fuel needed for a nuclear weapon.<br />The enrichment level is higher than at any point since the deal was signed, and crosses a red line set previously by European countries that remained committed to the agreement after the Trump administration withdrew from it in 2018.<br />The breach threatens to complicate a planned effort by the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden to revive the deal, which placed limits on Tehran’s nuclear program, and raises tensions in the Middle East when the region is already on edge.<br />Tehran has vowed to avenge the killings of a top Iranian nuclear scientist in November and a senior Iranian general, who died in a U.S. drone strike last January. The strike followed a year of spiraling hostilities in the region that included explosions on oil tankers and an attack on key Saudi oil facilities that the U.S. blamed on Iran.<br />Iranian forces also seized a South Korea-flagged ship on Monday, according to a semiofficial Iranian news agency, further heightening tensions with a U.S. ally. Forces boarded the vessel because it was creating unspecified pollution in the Persian Gulf, the agency said. The vessel’s owner, DM Shipping of Busan, South Korea, didn’t respond to calls."
