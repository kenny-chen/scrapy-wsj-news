    "body": "Former Zappos.com Inc. Chief Executive Tony Hsieh was alone in a locked shed and possibly intoxicated, surrounded by candles, a propane heater and other flammable material when the fire that killed him ignited on Nov. 18, according to fire department officials.<br />The fire marshal classified the fire’s origin as undetermined in a report released Tuesday because he couldn’t reject any of four possible causes he had identified: misuse of candles; a portable propane heater; improperly discarded smoking material, or “carelessness or an intentional act by Mr. Hsieh.”<br />A police investigation found no criminality associated with the fire, the New London Police Department said Tuesday.<br />Mr. Hsieh was 46 years old when he died on Nov. 27, nine days after the fire at his girlfriend’s home in New London, Conn. The Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Mr. Hsieh died of complications of smoke inhalation and ruled the death an accident. The full autopsy report will be completed later this week but won’t be available to the public, the chief medical examiner said Tuesday.<br />A spokeswoman for the Hsieh family declined to comment, saying the family is “focused on their work to continue Tony’s legacy.”"
