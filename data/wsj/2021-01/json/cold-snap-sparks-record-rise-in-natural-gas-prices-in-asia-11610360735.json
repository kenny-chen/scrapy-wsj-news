    "body": "A blast of cold weather in northeast Asia and a shortage of ships for transporting gas have sparked a scramble for cargoes of liquefied natural gas, igniting a steep rise in prices.<br />Prices for LNG shipped to China, Japan and South Korea, all major importers, have surged from record lows to all-time highs in less than a year. The regional price benchmark assessed by S&P Global Platts rose to $21.453 per million British thermal units on Friday, and has shot up 42% so far in 2021.<br />LNG is 10 times more expensive than it was when coronavirus hammered demand for oil and gas in the spring of 2020, the nadir of a yearslong slump in gas prices globally. In some cases, prices paid on the ground for cargoes have exceeded the levels indicated by Platts.<br />“It is a perfect storm,” said Toby Dunipace, executive director for LNG at London shipbroker Simpson Spence Young. Stores of gas in East Asia were severely depleted after the mercury plunged, he added.<br />Despite outages for producers in Australia, Norway and elsewhere, there is no global shortage of LNG. The trouble is moving gas to where it is needed."
