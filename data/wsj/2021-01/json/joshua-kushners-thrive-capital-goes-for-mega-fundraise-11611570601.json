    "body": "Thrive Capital, a venture firm owned by Joshua Kushner, is wrapping up a major new fundraising on the heels of several public listings by its portfolio companies.<br />The firm is raising about $2 billion for a pair of early-stage and growth funds, according to people familiar with the situation. It made filings related to Thrive Capital Partners VII LP and Thrive Capital Partners VII Growth LP with the state of Delaware on Jan. 12. The filings didn’t specify the fundraising targets.<br />Thrive’s representatives declined to comment.<br />The amount Thrive seeks is double what it raised in 2018, and shows the firm’s fast growth over the past decade. It launched with a $10 million fund in 2009.<br />Thrive’s fundraising is building on the success of its portfolio. It was an investor in companies including  Affirm Holdings Inc.,   Lemonade Inc.,  and  Unity Software Inc.,  all of which went public in recent months. It also holds stakes in Oscar, a health insurance company officially called Mulberry Health Inc., that was incubated within Thrive, as well as real-estate company Compass, both of which filed to go public."
