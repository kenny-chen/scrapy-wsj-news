    "body": "Chinese video-clip and live-streaming group Kuaishou Technology is seeking to raise up to $5.4 billion from an initial public offering, joining a string of tech companies from China that have listed in Hong Kong.<br />Kuaishou on Monday began taking investor orders for the stock sale ahead of a listing on Feb. 5, a term sheet showed. The company is backed by  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  and competes with ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese company behind TikTok.<br />With a minimum deal size of $4.95 billion, the IPO would be the largest in the world since late 2019, when state-controlled Saudi Arabian Oil Co., commonly known as Aramco, raised $29.4 billion, Dealogic figures show. It would also be the largest in Hong Kong since  Budweiser Brewing Co. APAC Ltd. , the Asian unit of  Anheuser-Busch InBev SA ., raised $5.75 billion in September 2019.<br />The company is selling 365.2 million new shares at an indicative range of 105 to 115 Hong Kong dollars, according to a term sheet seen by The Wall Street Journal. It plans to fix the offer price on Jan. 29. At the top of the range, the deal implies a market capitalization of $60.9 billion.<br />The offering size could increase to up to $6.2 billion after underwriting banks exercise an option to sell 15% more shares."
