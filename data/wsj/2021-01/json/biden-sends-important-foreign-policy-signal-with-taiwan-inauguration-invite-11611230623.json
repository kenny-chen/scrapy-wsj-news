    "body": "TAIPEI—Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the U.S. overcame four decades of precedent when she accepted a formal invitation to attend President Joe Biden’s inauguration, calming fears on the self-ruled island that U.S. support would erode in the post-Trump era.<br />Bi-khim Hsiao, Taipei’s top representative in the U.S., tweeted a video of herself standing in front of the U.S. Capitol building ahead of Mr. Biden’s inauguration on Tuesday, saying she was honored to attend the ceremony.<br />“Democracy is our common language and freedom is our common objective,” she said.<br />Ms. Hsiao’s attendance at the behest of the Biden administration marked the first time Taiwan was officially represented at a presidential swearing in since Washington transferred diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, according to Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry. In a tweet, the departing chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Idaho Republican Jim Risch, applauded the incoming White House for the invitation.<br />Beijing sees Taiwan as part of Chinese territory and regards U.S. interactions with the democratic, self-ruled island as one of the most sensitive issues in bilateral relations with Washington. Chinese leaders were taken aback four years ago when then U.S. president-elect Donald Trump accepted a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen."
