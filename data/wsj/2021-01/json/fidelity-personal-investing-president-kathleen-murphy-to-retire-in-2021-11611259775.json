    "body": "Fidelity Investments’ Kathleen Murphy will retire later this year as president of the money manager’s sprawling personal-investing business.<br />Ms. Murphy, 57 years old, plans to step down by midyear, Fidelity Chief Executive Abigail Johnson wrote in a memo to staff Thursday. The firm expects to name a successor in the coming months, people familiar with the matter said. Ms. Murphy plans to take some time off before returning to Fidelity in a different role, the people said.<br />Fidelity’s personal-investing business oversees $3.6 trillion, more than tripling its assets under management during her tenure. Customer accounts have jumped to 26 million from 12 million since 2009, when Ms. Murphy joined the firm. The division has more than 18,000 employees.<br />Ms. Murphy’s remit spans everything from brokerage and individual-retirement accounts to the team that devises new investment products.<br />She led the division for more than a dozen years, spearheading the growth of Fidelity’s financial-advisory arm and maintaining its leading role in a brokerage industry roiled by technology, consolidation and a relentless drive to lower costs. Under her watch, Fidelity joined its peers in slashing commissions to zero and offering fractional-share trading, while also introducing Wall Street’s first no-fee mutual funds."
