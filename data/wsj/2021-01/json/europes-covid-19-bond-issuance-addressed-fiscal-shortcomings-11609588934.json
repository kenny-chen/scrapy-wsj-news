    "body": "<br />The eurozone has always had a fundamental weakness compared with the U.S. when dealing with financial and economic crises: While its 19 countries share a currency and interest-rate policy, they have no common tax-raising or spending power.<br />In 2020, the European Union took a big step toward correcting that deficiency by starting to issue bonds on behalf of all member countries, known as common bonds. Beginning in 2021, some common bonds will be repaid through taxes raised by the EU itself.<br />This fiscal role for the EU is meant to be a one-off, but policy made in the teeth of a crisis—in this case the coronavirus pandemic—often sticks. Many investors and analysts say that a central ability to make taxation and spending decisions at the EU level will become permanent going forward.<br />Europe’s leaders signed two support packages to help the 19 eurozone members and eight other countries that don’t use the euro cope with the Covid-19 crisis. Almost €40 billion, equivalent to almost $49 billion, of bonds were sold in 2020, and another €210 billion of bonds are expected to be sold in 2021, according to Pictet Wealth Management. Total funding from bond sales for the packages is expected to total €850 billion."
