    "body": "Mondelez International Inc.  said it is making investments to maintain the ground it gained on competitors last year as shoppers bought more of its snacks while they spent time at home during the pandemic.<br />The Chicago-based maker of Oreos and Triscuits said Thursday that comparable sales rose 3.2% annually in the fourth quarter, in line with expectations. Sales growth by that measure moderated somewhat from earlier in the pandemic, especially in North America.<br />Shares fell 1% to $56.50 Thursday afternoon. But Mondelez said it had increased market share in businesses such as cookies and crackers in the U.S. and chocolate in the U.K.<br />“We’ve gained a lot of new consumers in our brands,” said Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put on an investor call. “We are counting on being able to do that again this year.”<br />He said Mondelez is increasing its advertising budget and to focus more on digital outlets. The company said it has also benefited from delivering its snacks directly to stores, rather than to warehouses or third-party distributors."
