    "body": "U.S. stock futures rose on the first major trading day of 2021 on hopes that continued government stimulus and the rollout of coronavirus vaccines will bode well for equities.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed about 0.4%, pointing to gains for both gauges after the opening bell. The benchmark indexes closed at record levels Dec. 31. Nasdaq-100 futures also added 0.4% Monday, suggesting a rise in technology stocks.<br />Investors are starting the new year on an optimistic note, amid expectations that the widespread rollout of coronavirus vaccines will allow economic activity to return to pre-pandemic levels. Stocks have been buoyed in recent weeks on such bets even as the pandemic continues to spread, with hospitalization rates in the U.S. climbing to a record high Sunday.<br />“There is still really bad news on the virus, but the market is looking through that because of the vaccines,” said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. “We are certainly positively tilted, given the expected economic recovery, historically low interest rates, a lot of fiscal spending and monetary policy to come: all of that positivity remains.”<br />In premarket trading, Tesla climbed 2% after the electric-car maker said it delivered a record 499,550 cars last year, just shy of its half a million target."
