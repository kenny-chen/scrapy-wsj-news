    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. Justice Department filed charges against an Iranian academic, alleging that he covertly drew a salary from the government of Iran while living and working in the U.S. as a professor, political scientist and Middle East expert.<br />In a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court, the government charged Kaveh Afrasiabi, an Iranian citizen with U.S. permanent residency, with two counts of acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Typically, first-time offenders receive well below the maximum penalty.<br />The government alleges that Mr. Afrasiabi has been receiving a salary—totaling at least $265,000—from the Iranian mission to the United Nations since at least 2007, and health-care benefits since at least 2011. During that time, the complaint says, he helped Iran shape its public messaging in the media and advocated Iranian government positions at the highest levels of U.S. government.<br />Mr. Afrasiabi made contact with numerous U.S. government officials without disclosing his ties to the Iranian government, according to the government, including an unnamed member of Congress and his staff as well as a senior official in the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.<br />Such consulting activity usually requires a public registration with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law designed to bring transparency to the advocacy work of foreign states. In recent years, the Justice Department has reinvigorated its enforcement of the foreign-agents law, charging a number of lobbyists, consultants, business figures and academics for failing to disclose their ties to foreign states or foreign income."
