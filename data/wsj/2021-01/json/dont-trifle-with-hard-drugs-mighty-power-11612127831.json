    "body": "Regarding Sally Satel’s review of “Drug Use For Grown-Ups” by Carl L. Hart, neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Columbia University (Bookshelf, Jan. 14): I’m a 44-year-old male who is 15 years into a 25-year sentence for shooting a man four times in a cocaine deal that went sideways. I’ve been selling and using drugs since I was 12 years old. All three of my uncles are dead from opiate-related deaths. My childhood best friend overdosed from heroin in 2017. Setting aside the arguments that include freedom of choice and putting a dent in the profits of drug cartels, I attempt to look at drugs in a more nuanced way.<br />However, what keeps nagging me is that in all my experience with this subject, I have yet to meet one of these “grown-ups” who can manage weekend, or casual, heroin, crack or crystal-meth use.<br />In considering this conundrum, I thought, well, Prof. Hart being an Ivy League college professor, he must bring in a considerable salary. I wonder if Prof. Hart lost his job today and was left with the challenges of unemployment, God forbid, if he could put away his heroin use as a responsible grown-up would do. But if not, how would he support his habit?<br />Levi Jones, #130599<br />Florida Department of Corrections"
