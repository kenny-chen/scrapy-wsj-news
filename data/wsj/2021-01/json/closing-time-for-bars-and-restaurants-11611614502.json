    "body": "Hattiesburg, Miss.<br />From the first moment of my first shift on my first day in a restaurant, I knew I wanted to own my own place. That was 40 years ago and I’ve loved every challenge the restaurant business has thrown my way—until now. I fear the work of four decades won’t survive the coming months without a plan that truly addresses my industry’s needs.<br />In April I sat down with my wife, 22-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son and told them we may lose some, or all, of the six restaurants and two bars we owned. In the same conversation, I told them there was also a strong chance we might have to sell our home.<br />Nearly a year into the pandemic, I have permanently closed two restaurants and a bar—leaving 52 people to have difficult conversations with their own families. For the first time in my career, I have to ask for help.<br />The pandemic is unfair. A tiny airborne particle threatens everything I’ve spent 40 years working to build. My teams have done nothing wrong. We work hard, we’re honest, we roll with the punches, and we always do our best to serve our customers and community."
