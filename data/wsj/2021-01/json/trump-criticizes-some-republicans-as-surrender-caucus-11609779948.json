    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Trump disparaged Senate Republicans who aren’t backing further challenges to Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential election victory, jumping into a fight that has split the party ahead of a joint session of Congress to certify the winner.<br />“The ‘Surrender Caucus’ within the Republican Party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective ‘guardians’ of our Nation,” he tweeted Monday, calling them “willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers!”<br />Mr. Trump has blamed voter fraud for his defeat, but no significant evidence emerged that would challenge the result. Then Attorney General William Barr said last month the Justice Department hadn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud that could reverse Mr. Biden’s election victory. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the November election results that delivered the state to Mr. Biden.<br />Mr. Trump’s comments came as a dozen Republican senators, under intense pressure from Trump supporters, have said they would challenge certification of Mr. Biden’s win despite the Republican leaders’ pleas not to do so.<br />It takes one House lawmaker and one senator to object to a state’s electoral votes in writing on Jan. 6. The objection, once filed, triggers two hours of concurrent debate and votes in each chamber. Majorities in the House and Senate have to agree for the challenge to be successful in rejecting any state’s results."
