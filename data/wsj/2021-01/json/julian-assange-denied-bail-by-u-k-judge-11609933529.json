    "body": "LONDON—A British judge refused bail for Julian Assange pending a U.S. appeal against a decision to deny his extradition to the U.S. on spying charges.<br />Judge Vanessa Baraitser said the WikiLeaks founder posed a flight risk. The decision means Mr. Assange will remain in a British jail until the appeal is heard, which lawyers say should be within a few months.<br />Mr. Assange, a 49-year-old Australian, is wanted in the U.S. on 18 charges of breaking espionage laws and conspiring to hack a military computer. The alleged offenses relate to the publication in 2010 and 2011 by WikiLeaks of a huge trove of classified material that painted a bleak picture of the American campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan and their aftermath.<br />Judge Baraitser on Monday refused Mr. Assange’s extradition to the U.S., saying his fragile mental health means he would likely attempt suicide if incarcerated in a U.S. prison while awaiting trial.<br />Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com"
