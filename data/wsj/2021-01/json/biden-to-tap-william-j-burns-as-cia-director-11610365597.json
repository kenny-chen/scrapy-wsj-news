    "body": "WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden plans to nominate William J. Burns, a former career diplomat with 33 years of service, as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency.<br />Mr. Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia and Jordan and a former deputy secretary of state who served under Republican and Democratic administrations, retired in 2014 and serves as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.<br />“Bill Burns is an exemplary diplomat with decades of experience on the world stage keeping our people and our country safe and secure,” Mr. Biden said. “He shares my profound belief that intelligence must be apolitical and that the dedicated intelligence professionals serving our nation deserve our gratitude and respect.”<br />While not an intelligence agency professional, Mr. Burns has experience with sensitive national security matters.<br />Following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, he and senior CIA officials met quietly with Libya’s then-intelligence chief, Musa Kusa, forging a settlement over the Pan Am 103 terrorist attack and dictator Moammar Gadhafi’s agreement to abandon weapons of mass destruction programs."
