    "body": "A federal court judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., denied bail for Eduard Florea, a self-proclaimed Proud Boys supporter, and ordered him detained in U.S. custody while he awaits trial on charges that he possessed more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.<br />U.S. Magistrate Judge Sanket Bulsara said Wednesday that Mr. Florea posed a significant danger to the community and reflected “a premeditated plan to exact violence.”<br />Mr. Florea posted several threatening statements before and during the attack of the U.S. Capitol last week, according to the complaint. These included comments about a U.S. senator-elect and travel plans to Washington, D.C., as part of a group armed with “guns cleaned and loaded.”<br />On Wednesday, Mr. Florea’s defense lawyer, Mia Eisner-Grynberg, urged the court to release him on a bond secured by him, his mother and his wife.<br />“This is not a case where Mr. Florea was found committing an act of violence,” Ms. Eisner-Grynberg said, criticizing the government’s reliance on a series of social-media posts."
