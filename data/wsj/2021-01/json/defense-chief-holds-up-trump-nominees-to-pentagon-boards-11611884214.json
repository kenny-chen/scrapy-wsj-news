    "body": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has suspended the onboarding process for several last-minute Trump administration nominees to Pentagon advisory boards, defense officials said, effectively preventing them from being seated.<br />Among those affected are Corey Lewandowski, former President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign manager, and David Bossie, a former Trump deputy campaign manager.<br />In December, then-Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller named them to the Defense Business Board, an unpaid group which is intended to provide the defense secretary and other leaders with private-sector advice on business practices.<br />They were among dozens of Trump appointees to government boards in the final weeks of the former president’s term, including the business board, the Defense Policy Board and others. Messrs. Lewandowski and Bossie didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Mr. Austin’s directive applied to Trump nominees who were still in the process of seeking security clearances and being seated. Other nominees already had completed the onboarding process and had joined their advisory panels. Defense officials couldn’t say how many nominees were affected by Mr. Austin’s directive, which applied to at least five boards and which was first reported by Politico."
