Bridges described himself as “opposed to certain methods used by ISIS” but was happy to offer lessons from his combat training, including how best to defend a compound from a special forces raid.<br />Pfc. Bridges, a native of Stow, Ohio, was charged with attempting to give support to a terrorist organization and attempted murder of U.S. military service members. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Army Counterintelligence arrested Pfc. Bridges on Tuesday. He will make his first court appearance in federal court in Georgia on Thursday.<br />A lawyer for Pfc. Bridges couldn’t immediately be identified."
