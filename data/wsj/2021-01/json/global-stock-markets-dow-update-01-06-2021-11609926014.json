    "body": "U.S. tech-stock futures fell Wednesday as investors bet that the Democrats were poised to take control of the Senate following early results from Georgia’s runoff elections.<br />Futures tied to the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 index declined 1.2% on expectations that a Democrat-controlled Congress would lead to higher taxes and tighter regulations on tech giants. S&P 500 futures were down 0.2%.<br />Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.1%, while those tied to the Russell 2000, which tracks smaller stocks, jumped 2.2%. Both indexes are filled with companies beaten down by the coronavirus pandemic that stand to benefit from higher fiscal spending.<br />A change of control in the Senate is seen by some as a catalyst that could shift the types of stocks favored by investors away from names that dominated last year’s rally. Big tech companies were getting hit hardest in premarket trading.  Facebook  fell 2.3%, while  Twitter ,   Netflix  and Alphabet all fell 1.8%.<br />“The negativity today is concentrated in these large cap, growth stocks, where, frankly, valuations are already quite high,” said Mike Bell, a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management."
