    "body": "SEOUL—South Korea’s population decreased for the first time in 2020, entering a downward trend that is likely to be worsened by the pandemic.<br />South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, reported a population of 51.8 million last year, a drop of 20,838 people from 2019, according to government data released Sunday, measuring citizen registration numbers.<br />Leading the population drop is South Korea’s low number of births. Births have fallen to record lows every year since 2016. The average number of children a woman will bear in her lifetime in South Korea was 1.1 last year, the lowest fertility rate in the world, according to a United Nations Population Fund’s survey of more than 200 countries.<br />Statistics Korea, South Korea’s statistics arm, initially predicted the country’s population would enter into decline in 2021 after accounting for other population-change factors, such as immigration.<br />But the pandemic, which hammered jobs and forced couples to delay marriages, is likely to have weighed on birth rates, especially in South Korea where the majority of child births occur after marriage, said Choi Seong-soo, a sociology professor at Yonsei University in Seoul."
