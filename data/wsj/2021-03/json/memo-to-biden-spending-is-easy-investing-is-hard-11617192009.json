    "body": "President Biden’s ambitious agenda to remake the American economy comes in two stages. Stage one, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, is intended to jolt the economy back to life with a huge dollop of old-fashioned Keynesian demand-side stimulus. Mr. Biden should be pleased with the results: as checks have landed in consumer bank accounts, growth has begun to surge.<br />Stage two, which Mr. Biden started rolling out Wednesday, is more supply-sided: He aims to raise the economy’s productive potential by investing in its physical and human capital. Stage two matters more than stage one because its consequences will be more enduring.<br />It is also much harder to pull off. That’s because long-run growth depends not just on the quantity of investment but how it’s targeted.<br />Mr. Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan has goals beyond simply raising gross domestic product: narrowing racial, urban-rural and economic disparities, boosting union membership and combating climate change. Not to mention the challenge of getting any legislation through a closely divided Congress.<br />Federal investment in domestic physical infrastructure, research and development, and education and training has declined steadily since the 1960s, to between 1% and 2% of GDP recently. Mr. Biden aims to reverse that, boosting federal investment by 1% of GDP over eight years."
