    "body": "U.S. real-estate companies that have borrowed billions of dollars in the Israeli bond market in recent years are facing new rules proposed by the Israel Securities Authority that would tighten the spigot.<br />The rules would change how bonds issued by many foreign companies are rated in a way that would discourage Israeli mutual funds, a dominant market player, from buying them, according to market participants.<br />“You’re basically marking an ‘X’ on the entire sector,” said Nadav Berkovich, an analyst with IBI Investment House Ltd.<br />The Authority is proposing the change in response to high-profile defaults by U.S. bond issuers. Most recently, All Year Holdings Ltd., a Brooklyn property owner that is one of the largest U.S. issuers of Israeli bonds, suffered big losses and its bonds were delisted from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.<br />The Authority earlier this month said All Year was under investigation. Representatives for All Year didn’t respond to requests for comment."
