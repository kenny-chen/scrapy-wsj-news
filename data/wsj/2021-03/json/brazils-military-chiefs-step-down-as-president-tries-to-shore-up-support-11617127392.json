    "body": "SÃO PAULO—The heads of Brazil’s army, navy and air force resigned Tuesday, rocking a right-wing government that is already facing public fury over President Jair Bolsonaro’s inability to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic.<br />Brazil’s Defense Ministry said the three commanders would be substituted, without giving further information. A person close to the ministry said the men had stepped down.<br />The announcement came a day after Mr. Bolsonaro replaced six of his cabinet members, including a surprise move to dismiss the defense minister. Political analysts said the firing of Fernando Azevedo e Silva, a former army general widely respected within the military, likely sparked the exit of army chief Edson Pujol, navy head Ilques Barbosa and air force chief Antônio Carlos Moretti Bermudez.<br />Mr. Bolsonaro has faced bitter criticism over his handling of the pandemic, which has killed more than 314,000 people here. With a new, more infectious variant of the coronavirus spreading, roughly 100 Brazilians are dying from the disease every hour, the highest death toll anywhere in the world.<br />Tensions between the military and Mr. Bolsonaro, a former right-wing army captain who served under Brazil’s 1964-85 dictatorship, have risen in recent months as the president has increasingly called on the armed forces to back him politically."
