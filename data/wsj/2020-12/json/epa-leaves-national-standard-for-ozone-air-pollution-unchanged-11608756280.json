    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Trump administration retained a national limit of 70 parts per billion for the pollutant ozone, the same standard set by the Obama administration, after business groups fought tougher standards.<br />Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency must review safety standards for certain pollutants every five years, with a mandate to consider only the latest science on public health and not the cost of implementation. Some environmental and health-advocacy organizations had pushed for a tightening of allowed ozone levels or a delay of the decision on setting new limits.<br />EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told reporters that Wednesday’s decision to leave the ozone standard unchanged would protect public health while reflecting the consensus of scientists at the EPA and outside advisers.<br />He also said the decision was reached within the clean-air law’s five-year deadline to review national air-quality standards, for what he said was just the second time in the agency’s history.<br />Manufacturers and energy companies are the most likely to benefit from a decision not to tighten ozone standards. Ground-level ozone, which comes from manufacturing plants, utilities and cars, can exacerbate a range of respiratory problems, including asthma."
