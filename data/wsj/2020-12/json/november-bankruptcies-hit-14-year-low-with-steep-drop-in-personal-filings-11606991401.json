    "body": "November bankruptcy filings in the U.S. hit a 14-year low, driven by a decline in individuals filing for protection from creditors as they continue to benefit from eviction moratoriums and other government assistance stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Total bankruptcy filings amounted to 34,440 for the month, the lowest monthly total since January 2006, according to data from legal-services provider Epiq Systems Inc.<br />The data, however, showed a large divergence between commercial and personal filings.<br />Commercial chapter 11 filings for November were up 40%, with 654 new cases compared with 449 over the same period in 2019, according to Epic.<br />On the other hand, noncommercial chapter 13 filings, which enable individuals to restructure their debt, were down 45% from a year earlier to 137,764 filings, according to Epiq. Noncommercial chapter 7 filings, which enable individuals to liquidate their assets so as to escape their debt burden, declined by 21% in November."
