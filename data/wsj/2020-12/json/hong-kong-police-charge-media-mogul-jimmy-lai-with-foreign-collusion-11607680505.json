    "body": "HONG KONG—Jimmy Lai, the publisher of a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong, has been charged with foreign collusion, making him the highest-profile figure charged under a new security law imposed by China to crush dissent in the city.<br />Hong Kong police said Friday that the 73-year-old was charged after an investigation by its National Security Department, a branch set up under the new security law. The charge of collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.<br />The police didn’t give further details, but a story in Mr. Lai’s newspaper, Apple Daily, said the charge was “reportedly based on Lai’s acceptance of interviews and calls for sanctions from foreign governments.”<br />Enforcement actions against pro-democracy figures have been accelerating in Hong Kong. In recent weeks, authorities expelled opposition lawmakers from the legislature and jailed prominent activists including Joshua Wong on crimes related to the mass protests that rocked Hong Kong last year.<br />On Monday, Hong Kong police arrested eight men related to a peaceful protest at a university this year, three of them on suspicion of national security crimes. On Tuesday, police arrested seven pro-democracy activists, including a former lawmaker, related to participation in a protest on July 1, the day after the national security law was imposed."
