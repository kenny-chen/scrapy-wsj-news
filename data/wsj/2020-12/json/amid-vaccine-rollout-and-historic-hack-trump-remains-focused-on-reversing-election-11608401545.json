    "body": "WASHINGTON—In a week that began with the Electoral College affirming Joe Biden’s victory and ended with Vice President Mike Pence taking a new Covid-19 vaccine, with a massive national security breach in between, President Trump has been largely out of sight.<br />Instead, six weeks after the election, the president remains fixated on his unsuccessful efforts to overturn the results, advisers say. He pays close attention to TV coverage of state hearings on alleged election fraud though no evidence of widespread fraud has surfaced, and in tweets and phone calls has urged his advisers and lawyers to keep going.<br />In early Saturday tweets, Mr. Trump chided fellow Republicans, “Don’t be weak fools!” and urged them to join a protest in Washington next month.<br />“He’s still in the fight-for-every-vote mode,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a Trump loyalist, who this week acknowledged Mr. Biden’s victory and said the president’s path to overturning the results is “very, very narrow.”<br />An administration official described the president’s strategy to overturn the election results as: “Let’s throw a giant plate of spaghetti at the wall and hope that at least one noodle sticks.”"
