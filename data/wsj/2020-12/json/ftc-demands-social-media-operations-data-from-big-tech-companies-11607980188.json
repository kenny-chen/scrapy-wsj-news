    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Federal Trade Commission on Monday ordered nine prominent social-media and internet companies to provide a litany of data about their operations as part of a wide-ranging study into their business practices.<br />The orders demand the companies turn over detailed, private business information about how they track Americans’ online activities and how they use that data.<br />Companies receiving letters included  Amazon.com Inc.,   Facebook Inc.  and its subsidiary WhatsApp Inc., Reddit Inc.,  Snap Inc.,   Twitter Inc.,   Alphabet Inc.’s  YouTube LLC, Discord Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd., which is based in Beijing.<br />The announcement isn’t a law-enforcement action and doesn’t carry any immediate penalties, though the information gathered could form the basis for future action by the FTC. The agency has broad legal authority to seek information from U.S. companies and is also empowered to police unfair and deceptive business practices.<br />“Social media and video streaming companies now follow users everywhere through apps on their always-present mobile devices. This constant access allows these firms to monitor where users go, the people with whom they interact, and what they are doing. But to what end?” FTC Commissioners Rohit Chopra, Rebecca Slaughter and Christine Wilson said in a joint statement. “Too much about the industry remains dangerously opaque.”"
