    "body": "Egyptian authorities released three prominent human rights advocates on bail Thursday following weeks of international pressure to free them.<br />Activists Gasser Abdel-Razek, Karim Ennarah and Mohammed Basheer of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a well-known civil society group, were freed from Cairo’s Tora prison, according to the group’s acting director and Egyptian state media.<br />The three had been detained in separate police raids and held on terrorism charges that the organization said were presented without evidence.<br />The arrests sparked a global campaign to free them that included pressure from European governments, a letter from dozens of members of the U.S. Congress and a tweet from President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for secretary of state.<br />“I can confirm my friends and @eipr colleagues Gasser, Basheer and Karim have been released and are home which I guess means we (and you) managed to #FreeEIPRstaff,” said Hossam Bahgat, the acting director of the rights group, in a tweet."
