    "body": "FedEx Corp.  isn’t missing  Amazon.com Inc.  this holiday season.<br />Shipping volumes at FedEx’s Ground unit surged 29% in the latest quarter, as consumers continued to buy everyday goods online, while retailers urged them to do their holiday shopping earlier than normal against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The combination of factors boosted revenue and profits at the delivery company for the three months ended Nov. 30, which included Black Friday. FedEx has raised prices and handled a surge in e-commerce packages this year, even after it publicly split ways in 2019 with Amazon, the biggest online retailer.<br />FedEx has found more than enough packages to fill its network after parting ways with Amazon, helped by the overall growth of e-commerce during the pandemic and courting of new customers. Online sales rose 33% in the first nine months of 2020, FedEx said, compared with just a 1% gain in overall retail sales, excluding categories such as gas and food services.<br />FedEx’s large Express unit posted a 10% jump in volume from a year ago. It continues to benefit from tight capacity in the air-cargo market, as a severe decline in passenger flights that carried freight in their bellies has cut into supply. Air-cargo companies such as FedEx have been flying fuller jets and charging higher rates as a result."
