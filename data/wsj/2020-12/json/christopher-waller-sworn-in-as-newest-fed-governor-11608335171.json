    "body": "<br />Economist Christopher Waller joined the Federal Reserve Board of Governors upon being sworn in Friday, becoming the fifth member of the body nominated to his or her current position by President Trump.<br />Mr. Waller, formerly the research director of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, fills a term as governor that runs through January 2030. He has attended meetings of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year in his capacity at the St. Louis Fed. He headed the University of Notre Dame’s economics department before joining the regional Fed bank in 2009.<br />The Senate confirmed Mr. Waller in a 48-to-47 vote on Dec. 3. While he wasn’t viewed as a controversial candidate, his confirmation marked the first time the Senate had approved a governor in a lame-duck period that follows the November election before the president’s term ends in January, according to Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania.<br />Fed governor Lael Brainard is the only one of the board’s six members who was nominated to her slot by President Obama. One seat on the seven-member body remains vacant."
