    "body": "The head of the nation’s derivatives regulator will step down from his leadership role while remaining a commissioner, leaving control of the five-person panel in Republican hands, at least for now.<br />The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Thursday that Heath Tarbert will resign as chairman, the latest Trump appointee to announce plans to step aside as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to enter the White House on Jan. 20. A person familiar with Mr. Tarbert’s plans said he would retain his seat until he decides on his next move. His term expires in 2024.<br />That means Republicans will keep their 3-2 majority at the CFTC, possibly until 2022.<br />Republican commissioner Brian Quintenz hasn’t said when he plans to depart and is legally allowed to remain in the role until Jan. 3, 2022, according to a CFTC official.<br />Mr. Biden will likely appoint one of the commission’s two sitting Democrats—Dan Berkovitz or Rostin Behnam—as acting chairman while the Senate mulls an eventual nominee. But a Democratic chairman’s ability to pass tougher rules on banks, clearinghouses or derivatives traders would be held in check by the need to get at least one Republican vote."
