    "body": "The desserts were delicious, the reunions were warm, but you’ve just learned that someone at the holiday gathering you attended had Covid-19. What next? Today’s shorter quarantine guidelines, a variety of tests and newly available therapies call for updated protocols. So what should you do if you feel sick or if you spent time near the fellow guest who has been diagnosed? And is it safer to get tested if you’re considering meeting with family within the next several weeks?<br />Here’s what infectious-disease experts at some of the country’s top medical centers advise.<br /><br />How can you assess your level of exposure?<br />Before taking steps to get tested, determine your level of exposure and whether you’ve had close contact. Seeing others outside—with everyone wearing masks—doesn’t warrant a test. If both people were unmasked and within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes, that qualifies as exposure and warrants a test. If you wore a mask and the other person didn’t and was at a greater distance, exposure is less likely and you may not need to get tested, according to Peter Katona, professor of medicine and public health at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. If you’re indoors and have had close contact, defined as being within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes over 24 hours, you’re a good candidate for getting tested. “If somebody is exchanging air with you, then you have a chance of getting infected,” says Dr. Katona."
