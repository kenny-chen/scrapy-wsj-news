    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Trump administration, using its anticorruption powers, sanctioned three men including a convicted Chinese gangster who has set up businesses seeking to benefit from Beijing’s flagship transcontinental infrastructure-building program.<br />Wednesday’s action against Wan Kuok Koi, also widely known as “Broken Tooth,” comes as the administration escalates a pressure campaign against China in its last months in office.<br />The U.S. Treasury Department accused Mr. Wan of using business and other activities to try to legitimize the organized-crime gang he has reputedly led and piggyback on China’s Belt-and-Road Initiative to build infrastructure across Eurasia and other parts of the world.<br />The U.S. Treasury also sanctioned a top Liberian politician for allegedly bribing judges and other people and a former senior Kyrgyz official for alleged involvement in money-laundering. The sanctions all came under the so-called Global Magnitsky powers, named after a Russian whistle-blowing lawyer who died in a Moscow jail after accusing the government of corruption.<br />The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the Kyrgyz and Liberian missions to the United Nations."
