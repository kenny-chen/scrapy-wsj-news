    "body": "NEW DELHI— Wistron Corp.  apologized for mishandling wages at its plant in India that makes iPhones, saying it will correct the problems that led a group of angry workers to damage its facilities a week ago.<br />On Dec. 12, workers broke windows and overturned cars at a Wistron facility near India’s technology hub of Bangalore. They threw stones, tossed office furniture and set fire to a sign at Wistron’s operations, according to videos shown on Indian television.<br />Labor leaders said workers at the Taiwanese-owned company that is a contract manufacturer for  Apple Inc.  were upset about late wage payments and confusion over expected working hours and overtime payments.<br />Wistron has investigated and discovered the workers had legitimate complaints, said Wistron spokeswoman Joyce Chou. To try to fix the problems it has removed the vice president who oversees its business in India and started an anonymous hot-line for complaints and created other avenues for employees to disclose their concerns.<br />“We deeply regret this and apologize to all of our workers,” Ms. Chou said.  “This is a new facility, and we recognize that we made mistakes as we expanded. Some of the processes we put in place to manage labor agencies and payments need to be strengthened and upgraded.”"
