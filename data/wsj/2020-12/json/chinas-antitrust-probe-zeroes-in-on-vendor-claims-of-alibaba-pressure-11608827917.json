    "body": "<br />A Chinese antitrust probe into whether  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  abused its dominant market position casts a spotlight on long-standing contentions from merchants and rivals that the e-commerce giant pressures some sellers to operate only on its platforms.<br />The antimonopoly investigation, revealed by Beijing’s State Administration for Market Regulation on Thursday, adds to pressure on China’s biggest tech giants, which have spent much of the past year reeling from a concerted Trump administration attempt to block them from accessing U.S. markets and suppliers.<br />The timing of the Alibaba probe, which was coupled Thursday with a regulatory summons for Ant Group, Alibaba’s giant financial affiliate, is the latest evidence of a global shift in the regulation of technology giants that until recently were celebrated for creating wealth even as they upended the marketplace.<br />Domestically, China’s twin regulatory actions on Thursday also marked the latest nadir in the quickly deteriorating political fortunes of Jack Ma, Alibaba and Ant’s billionaire founder. Just weeks earlier, Mr. Ma, riding high on the cusp of a planned blockbuster public listing of Ant, used a high-profile speech at a regulatory event to excoriate senior government officials for what he called their outdated mentality."
