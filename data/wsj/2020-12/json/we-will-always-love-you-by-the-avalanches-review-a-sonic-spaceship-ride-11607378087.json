    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />At the dawn of the millennium the Avalanches released “Since I Left You” in their native Australia, a deliriously joyous collage album—it was said to contain over 3,500 discrete samples—that swirled disco, soft rock, sunshine pop, new wave and much more into an uplifting whole. It wasn’t released in other territories right away—getting permission for the source material turned out to be an enormous headache—but “Since I Left You” circulated freely on file-sharing sites and was already recognized as a classic by the time it came out in the U.S. late in 2001. As indie records go, it was an enormous success—it reached the U.K. top 10 and made many best-of-decade lists—and the group’s members regularly assured fans that they were hard at work on a follow-up that was coming soon. But the second Avalanches LP, the solid but less impressive “Wildflower,” didn’t arrive until 16 years later, so it was hard to hold your breath waiting for album number three. “We Will Always Love You” (Astralwerks), out Friday, is the band’s new LP, and it rewards that patience."
