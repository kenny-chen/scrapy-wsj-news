    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden has selected Denis McDonough, who served as White House chief of staff in the Obama administration, to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, the transition team said Thursday.<br />Before serving as chief of staff during President Barack Obama’s second term, Mr. McDonough was deputy national security adviser and worked for the National Security Council.<br />Mr. McDonough didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />If confirmed, Mr. McDonough would be the second non-veteran to hold the position, after David Shulkin, a medical doctor who was secretary early in President Trump’s administration.<br />Mr. McDonough’s experience shaping domestic and foreign policy was a factor in Mr. Biden’s decision to nominate him, according to a person familiar with the process. The person also cited Mr. McDonough’s understanding of legislative affairs and government bureaucracy, which are seen as key to navigating a department long beset by organizational challenges."
