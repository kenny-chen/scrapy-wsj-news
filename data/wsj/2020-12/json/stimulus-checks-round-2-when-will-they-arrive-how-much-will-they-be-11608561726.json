    "body": "Congress is likely to vote soon to authorize a second round of stimulus payments to households. There are many similarities to the ones that were paid in the spring but also some important differences. Here is what we know about them, though things could change as Congress releases details of the legislation and the government implements the program.<br />When will the second stimulus payments arrive?<br />Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday the first batch of payments could go out at the beginning of next week. That is faster than in the spring, where it took about two weeks after the legislation was signed. The first batches may also be larger than in the spring. That is because the government now has more information about groups that got later payments in the first round, including those who typically donâ€™t file tax returns and those who receive federal benefits. Those who receive paper checks instead of direct deposits will have to wait longer. The bill is written so the IRS makes the payments by Jan. 15, meaning that anyone eligible after that date would likely have to get the money as part of their 2020 tax return.<br />How much are the payments?<br />This time, households will get $600 per adult and $600 per child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round. That means a single parent with two children will get $1,800 now after receiving $2,200 in the spring."
