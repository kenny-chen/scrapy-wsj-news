    "body": "WASHINGTON—The bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to reach a compromise on a coronavirus relief package was completing a detailed summary Wednesday of much of their $908 billion framework, as Democratic and Republican leaders and the White House continued to wrangle over liability shields and state and local aid.<br />The expanding group, which began with nine senators and leaders of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of 50 House lawmakers, is pulling together a six-page breakdown on items including jobless aid and vaccine distribution, according to copies viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />But, reflecting the broader debate in the Capitol, the group is still working on how to structure the distribution of $160 billion in funding for state and local governments, as well as the single biggest hurdle in the talks: some form of legal protections for businesses and other entities operating during the pandemic.<br />The fleshed-out proposal emerged Wednesday at a time when many competing proposals are ricocheting around the Capitol as lawmakers rush to get a deal done before the end of the year.<br />On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) suggested lawmakers should simply omit the two most controversial issues. Hours later, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin presented a new $916 billion White House proposal to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) that included both state and local funding, as well as liability protections, but dropped the $300 a week in enhanced unemployment insurance and put in $600 direct checks to many Americans."
