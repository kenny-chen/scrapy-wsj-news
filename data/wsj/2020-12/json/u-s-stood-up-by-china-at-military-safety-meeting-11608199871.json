    "body": "HONG KONG—The U.S. military accused China’s People’s Liberation Army of skipping a scheduled bilateral discussion on aviation and maritime safety this week, a rare snub that comes at a sensitive moment in the soured relationship between Washington and Beijing.<br />In a statement issued late Wednesday, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the PLA “declined to participate” in a teleconference meeting scheduled to run from Monday to Wednesday under a regular dialogue process that the two militaries established in a 1998 pact.<br />The Chinese absence is “another example that China does not honor its agreements, and this should serve as a reminder to all nations as they pursue agreements with China going forward,” Adm. Phil Davidson, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said in the statement.<br />Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin acknowledged that the meeting didn’t take place and said the “responsibility lies entirely with the U.S. side.” Speaking at a routine briefing Thursday, he said the U.S. military’s allegations were “completely untenable and also irresponsible.”<br />Mr. Wang didn’t elaborate and said queries on specific circumstances should be directed to China’s Defense Ministry, which didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
