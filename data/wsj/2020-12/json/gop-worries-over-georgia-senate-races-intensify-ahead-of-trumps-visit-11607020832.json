    "body": "ATLANTA—Georgia’s Republican Party is split by infighting ahead of President Trump’s first postelection rally in the state on Saturday, as he and his supporters attack top state Republicans and two pro-Trump attorneys call on voters to boycott two crucial Senate runoffs.<br />Mr. Trump’s visit is intended to support incumbent Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in the Jan. 5 runoffs, which will determine control of the Senate. Mr. Perdue is facing Democrat Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, and Ms. Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock, a pastor.<br />White House officials and Trump campaign aides say they know the president could go off script to criticize GOP Gov. Brian Kemp and other Republican officials—as he has repeatedly—at Saturday’s rally in Valdosta. They know he could fixate on his complaints that the election was rigged, even though Georgia has certified President-elect Joe Biden as the winner of the state’s 16 electoral votes. No evidence of widespread voter fraud, in Georgia or elsewhere, has emerged.<br />But they remain hopeful that Mr. Trump will deliver the agreed-upon message: Republicans must vote, so they can keep both senators in office and ensure a Republican Senate majority that can protect the president’s accomplishments.<br />“I’m not sure what he’s going to say,” one Trump adviser said. “He’s super pissed.”"
