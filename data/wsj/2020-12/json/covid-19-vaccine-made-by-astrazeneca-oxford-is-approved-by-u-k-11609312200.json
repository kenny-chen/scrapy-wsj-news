    "body": "LONDON—The U.K. authorized a Covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC, opening the door for the rollout of millions of doses in a country where infections have surged amid a more infectious variant of the virus.<br />The green light represents the third emergency-use approval of a Western-developed vaccine this month and comes as cases rise sharply in the U.S. and Europe. A shot developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and Germany’s  BioNTech  SE and one by  Moderna Inc.  have both been cleared in the U.S. and are being distributed there.<br />AstraZeneca’s shot—less effective in clinical trials than its rivals’ injections—won’t be available in the U.S. until the Food and Drug Administration reviews large-scale trials still being conducted there and decides to authorize its use.<br />The U.K. authorization comes as the country battles a new, potentially more contagious variant of the coronavirus, which has now also been recorded in the U.S.<br />The mutated virus triggered travel bans recently on visitors and goods from Britain, ratcheting up the political urgency for a speedy vaccine rollout here. Pfizer’s shot is already available in the U.K., and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Dec. 21 that half a million of the first of a two-dose regimen had been administered."
