    "body": "Vice President Mike Pence was administered the Covid-19 vaccine in a televised event Friday, becoming the senior-most member of the Trump administration known to have received the shot.<br />Mr. Pence received his first of two doses alongside second lady Karen Pence and Surgeon General Jerome Adams, in an event held in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, in front of two signs reading “Safe and Effective.” Mr. Adams flashed the vice president a thumbs-up after all three of them had received their shots.<br />“I didn’t feel a thing,” Mr. Pence said afterward. He said he and the second lady were “more than happy to step forward to take this safe and effective coronavirus vaccine.”<br />The first U.S. Covid-19 vaccinations began Monday, in the most urgent mass-immunization campaign since the 1950s. By Sunday, the U.S. government is expected to have completed distribution of an initial 2.9 million doses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week authorized the use of the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  and is expected to grant emergency-use authorization of a second vaccine, from  Moderna Inc.,  by late Friday.<br />About 40 million doses are expected to be available this month, and the federal government has said they should go to a priority group of health-care workers and nursing-home residents, who are considered at highest risk of exposure or illness. Together, they number about 24 million."
