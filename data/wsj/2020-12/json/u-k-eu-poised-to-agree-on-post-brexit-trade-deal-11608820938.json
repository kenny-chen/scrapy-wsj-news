    "body": "BRUSSELS—A post-Brexit trade accord between the U.K. and the European Union was being held up by last-minute negotiations over fisheries, officials said, but people close to the talks said a deal should be sealed in the coming hours.<br />An agreement, a few days before the Dec. 31 deadline, would end more than four years of uncertainty about future relations between major U.S. allies.<br />At stake are the terms for around $900 billion in trade between Britain and the EU and the depth of their cooperation on law enforcement and counterterrorism, among other issues.<br />EU and U.K. officials said Wednesday that the talks were entering their final phase and first signaled that an announcement could come Wednesday evening. Then, after talks continued through the night, on Thursday morning.<br />However on Thursday afternoon, negotiations were continuing, with the two teams ensconced in the EU executive’s 13-floor 1960s Berlaymont building, snacking on deliveries of pizza and sandwiches."
