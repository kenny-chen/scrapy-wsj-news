    "body": "DoorDash Inc. is set to cash in on the frenzy in initial public offerings.<br />The San Francisco food-delivery company is expected to price its shares Tuesday ahead of a trading debut Wednesday. It is expected to pick a price at the high end of or above its already-increased target range of $90 to $95 a share, according to people familiar with the offering.<br />At $95 or above, DoorDash would be valued at $36 billion or more on a fully diluted basis and including proceeds from the offering, which is expected to raise $3.1 billion or more.<br />That would mark a stunning run-up in the companyâ€™s valuation. Earlier this year, DoorDash was privately valued at more than $15 billion, up from just $1.4 billion in 2018. It also would be the latest sign of euphoria in the IPO market.<br />Fueled by a surging stock market and the stellar performance of recent technology listings, the volume of dollars raised on U.S. exchanges already has set a record, with 401 offerings raising nearly $146 billion this year far, outpacing the previous full-year record set in 1999 when $108 billion was raised, according to Dealogic IPO data that goes back to 1995."
