    "body": "A year ago, Sixtus Leung was busy helping Hong Kong protesters escape from a university campus besieged by police.<br />Now, after arriving in the U.S. on Nov. 30, he is seeking asylum and lobbying U.S. lawmakers for more support for young activists who want to leave Hong Kong.<br />“Everybody in my circle is frightened,” said the 34-year-old former leader of a political party that advocated self-determination for Hong Kong. “But Hong Kong is not yielding.”<br />Mr. Leung is part of a wave of activists fleeing the city, saying they fear activism is no longer tolerated since China imposed a national security law in June. The asylum seekers are likely to increase tensions between China and countries that accept them.<br />This month, another former legislator and a church pastor and his family made it to the U.K., saying they feared prosecution in Hong Kong for their political actions. Others have headed to Germany and Taiwan."
