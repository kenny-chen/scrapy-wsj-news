    "body": "Technology startups are ready to challenge traditional life insurers head on.<br />Bestow Inc. and Dayforward Inc. are making the leap to become life-insurance carriers, a move away from a model where startups only sell traditional insurersâ€™ policies.<br />The companies are banking on their versions of online technology for sizing up the risk of insurance applicants to provide cost efficiencies for expanding profit margins beyond those of traditional insurers.<br />Each company said it would maintain competitive premium rates and typically issue policies within minutes.<br />The budding life insurers face a difficult market environment. Among obstacles, regulators require life insurers to hold large amounts of capital to protect policyholders decades into the future, money they mostly invest in bonds. Bond yields are low and will likely remain low in the long term, cutting into investment profits."
