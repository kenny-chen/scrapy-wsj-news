    "body": "Group Nine Media, owner of websites such as The Dodo and NowThis, is considering using a blank-check company to acquire some of its competitors, according to people familiar with the matter, as the digital-media sector continues to consolidate.<br />In recent weeks, Group Nine Media has consulted with advisers about the possibility of pursuing deals through a special-purpose acquisition company, also known as a SPAC, the people said. Those blank-check companies raise capital by going public and can put the proceeds into deals.<br />Group Nine Media is interested in acquisitions that could grow its audience and give it more bargaining power with online advertisers.<br />The venture-backed company, which formed in 2016 through the merger of several digital-media businesses, has already begun buying competitors. Last year, it purchased PopSugar, a women-focused digital publisher, adding its site and web properties to a portfolio that includes animal-focused The Dodo and NowThis, a news publisher.<br />It isn’t clear which company or companies Group Nine Media would target for acquisitions. Group Nine’s all-stock deal with PopSugar valued Group Nine at $600 million, The Wall Street Journal reported."
