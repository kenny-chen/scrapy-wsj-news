    "body": "When  Nielsen Holdings  PLC’s top diversity executive stepped down after 12 years in the role, the company started looking for a hire.<br />Its new chief executive, David Kenny—at that point in the top job for only a few months—raised his hand.<br />Mr. Kenny took on the additional title in February of 2019. Fifteen months later, George Floyd’s killing by police sparked widespread protests and a national conversation on race. Since then, CEOs across industries have pledged to do more to advance racial equality in their workplaces.<br />By adding diversity chief to his job title last year, Mr. Kenny, age 59, is staking his reputation directly on the issue. Mr. Kenny, who is white, said he wants to ensure racial representation in the workplace gets the attention it deserves. “You get a big microphone when you’re a CEO,” he said.<br />Diversity is central to Nielsen’s business mission, he said. As a company that quantifies how people shop and consume TV and other media, its fortunes are tied to helping marketers understand different demographics."
