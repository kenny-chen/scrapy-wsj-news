    "body": "The Securities and Exchange Commission said it had settled charges against  Cheesecake Factory Inc.  for misleading investors about how the Covid-19 pandemic affected the restaurant chain.<br />The SEC said Friday that the company in the spring filed materially false and misleading disclosures in saying that locations were “operating sustainably.” Meanwhile, the company was losing about $6 million in cash weekly and estimated it had only about  four months’ worth of cash left, according to the agency.<br />Cheesecake Factory didn’t admit to the SEC’s findings but agreed to a penalty of $125,000, the regulator said. The company said in a filing that it fully cooperated with the SEC.<br />The SEC also said the company didn’t disclose that it had told landlords it wouldn’t pay rent in April because of the pandemic’s impact.<br />Cheesecake Factory said in a filing last month that while it paid a substantial majority of rent through September, some of its landlords have alleged that the company is in default on its leases."
