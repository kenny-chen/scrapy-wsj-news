    "body": "WASHINGTON—A group of rank-and-file lawmakers made a last-minute push to craft a bipartisan coronavirus aid proposal, as leadership in both parties indicated they might drop the most contentious issues in the talks and pass a narrower bill.<br />The bipartisan set of lawmakers has in recent days struggled to finish crafting a $908 billion aid package, tripping up over disagreements on creating liability protections for businesses and other entities to help them guard against coronavirus-related suits. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) last week proposed dropping the protections if Democrats agreed to forego state and local aid that has drawn Republican objections.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) indicated Sunday that Democrats may be open to a bill without state and local aid, which they have long insisted on in talks with Republicans.<br />“We need to act,” he said on CNN. “If acting means we’re not going to get everything we want, we think state and local is important, and if we can get that, we want to get it. But we want to get aid out to the people who are really, really struggling and are at great risk.”<br />Staff for Senate GOP leadership have started reviewing elements of the bipartisan group’s proposal that have support from both parties, according to a person familiar with the talks. The bipartisan proposal would add $300 a week to state unemployment benefits for four months, providing $300 billion in aid to small businesses, and sending $35 billion for health-care providers."
