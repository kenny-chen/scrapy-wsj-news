    "body": "At a time when much of Hollywood is reeling from Covid-19, Weta Digital, the visual-effects company behind “Avatar” and “Avengers: Endgame,” is looking to pull a growth story out of its magic hat.<br />The closely held New Zealand-based company, which was co-founded by “Lord of the Rings” director and special-effects wizard Peter Jackson, is adding some heavy hitters to its board of directors, including former  Walt Disney  Co.  Chief Operating Officer Tom Staggs.<br />Weta—named after an insect endemic to New Zealand—is also on the hunt for acquisitions in the special effects and animation space, part of a strategy to pivot into content creation as new streaming platforms look to stock up on fresh programming.<br />“We have a crew of over 1,200 people, very skilled, very talented people doing the best special effects I think that anyone does,” Mr. Jackson said in an interview. “And so we thought, how can we give this crew exciting projects going forward that go beyond just providing some shots for other people’s films.”<br />Mr. Jackson sees a big opportunity to provide animated programming for streaming services as well as movies and cable channels. “There’s a demand that’s tending to outstrip supply right now,” he said. Another plus for animation is that it is Covid-proof. While fears of the spread of coronavirus have made it challenging to shoot on TV and movie sets, animation work can be done remotely."
