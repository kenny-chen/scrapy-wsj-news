    "body": "3M Co.  said it plans to cut 2,900 jobs to reflect slumping demand for some of its products during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The St. Paul, Minn.-based industrial conglomerate has experienced unprecedented demand for its N95 face masks, which protect medical workers and others from the virus. But that personal-protective gear is just a sliver of the hundreds of products 3M makes for consumers, health-care providers and industrial businesses. Sales of 3M’s office supplies, industrial products and other goods have slumped as people stayed home from work and postponed dental appointments and medical procedures.<br />3M has said nonemergency medical procedures are unlikely to recover through next year as patients continue to stay away from hospitals and health-care facilities where patients are being treated for coronavirus. Homebound workers are consuming less office supplies, such as 3M’s Scotch tape and Post-it Notes. Sales in 3M’s electronics lines and products tied to the aerospace industry also have declined.<br />“The pandemic has advanced the pace of change and disrupted end markets around the world,” Chief Executive Mike Roman said in a statement.<br />3M’s shares rose 0.52% on Thursday to $172.80"
