    "body": "The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve said Tuesday they had extended the cutoff date for the Main Street Lending Program from Dec. 31 to Jan. 8 to process a last-minute crush to deliver loans.<br />Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last month declined to grant an extension to several emergency-lending programs run by the Fed, including the Main Street Lending Program, which is designed to support lending to small and midsize businesses and nonprofits disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.<br />As a result, the program stopped accepting loans after Dec. 14, but it witnessed a flood of loan submissions leading up to that deadline, some of which are still being processed.<br />While the virus-relief package signed Sunday by President Trump also requires the Fed to close the emergency-lending programs this year, it allows completed Main Street loans to be processed until Jan. 8.<br />As of Dec. 23, the Fed had funded more than $15 billion in loans through the program, an increase from $6 billion in loans funded just four weeks earlier, according to filings released Monday."
