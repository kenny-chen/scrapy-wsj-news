    "body": "Share buybacks: Yea or nay?<br />For investors, one of the big results of the election could wind up being the fate of corporate stock buybacks. The widely used financial tool—which has been a source of support for the record-setting stock market—has been attacked by some academics and progressive politicians. Now, those politicians will be in a better position to do something about it.<br />Buybacks have been a particularly hot issue since 2018 when, under terms of the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts, big U.S. companies repatriated billions of dollars that had been stashed for years in overseas tax havens. In the resulting binge, the dollar value of big companies’ repurchases of their own stock shot up 55% to a record $806 billion. Buyback foes complained that such repurchases enriched shareholders, generally wealthier Americans, at the expense of workers, new plants and research, and broader economic development<br />Buybacks are down about 30% this year, as companies conserve cash to ride out the pandemic.
