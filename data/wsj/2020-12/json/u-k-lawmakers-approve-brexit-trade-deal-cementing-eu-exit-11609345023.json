    "body": "LONDON—British lawmakers approved a historic free-trade agreement with the European Union, an unsurprising but important step in cementing the U.K.’s departure from the bloc after more than 40 years as one of its biggest member states.<br />The 1,246-page legal text agreed between London and Brussels on Christmas Eve was ratified by the House of Commons, Parliament’s lower house, after just six hours of debate on Wednesday. Queen Elizabeth II is expected to give her formal assent to the legislation at around midnight, the final step in the U.K.’s legislative process.<br />The tight timetable reflects the need to ratify the agreement before the end of the year, or risk economic disruption and legal uncertainty as a yearlong transition period to smooth the U.K.’s EU exit comes to an end. Many lawmakers opposed to Brexit said they would vote reluctantly in favor of the U.K.-EU treaty, as the only alternative is a messy close to the saga.<br />Speaking in Parliament at the opening of Wednesday’s debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the treaty represented a new beginning for the U.K. and the EU.<br />“What we wanted was not a rupture but a resolution—a resolution of the old, tired, vexed question of Britain’s political relations with Europe, which has bedeviled our postwar history,” he said."
