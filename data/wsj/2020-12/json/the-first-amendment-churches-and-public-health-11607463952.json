    "body": "Robert Sommers posits that “quickly” going in and out of the liquor store is less likely to spread the coronavirus than attending church (Letters, Dec. 3). In the Archdiocese of Chicago, which ministers to 2.2. million Catholics, we wear masks, sanitize our hands (two times after entering church), sit two pews apart in assigned seats, with only two to four people per pew (depending on family size). We don’t sing at all. We don’t “inhale and exhale forcefully” while praying. Oh, and we register for contact tracing every time we attend Mass.<br />In addition, our Catholic school children have been in classroom attendance consistently since September with fewer than 10 possible cases of secondary spread, according to a Nov. 22 story by NBC news.<br />I assume Mr. Sommers’s local liquor store follows similar protocols?<br />Nancy Riesbeck<br />Palos Heights, Ill."
