    "body": "A panel of outside medical experts is set to convene Thursday to advise the Food and Drug Administration about the first Covid-19 vaccine the agency is considering for broad use among the American public.<br />The vaccine, from  Pfizer Inc.  and its German partner,  BioNTech SE ,  has already been shown in clinical research to reduce the rate of symptomatic disease by 95% and seems certain to get a thumbs-up from both the committee and the FDA. The FDA isn’t required to accept the decision of an advisory panel, but generally does so.<br />The 23-member Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is likely to authorize use of the vaccine, according to Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan health researcher who chairs the advisory committee.<br />Dr. Monto said that assessment is based on data released Tuesday showing that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and 95% effective, with adverse reactions rare despite a range of modest side effects such as headaches and fatigue that occur soon after injections.<br />The panel’s meeting will be public and live-streamed. FDA officials hope the discussion will show the care with which the vaccine’s safety has been reviewed—part of a broader effort to convince the public that the vaccine hasn’t been rushed to market for political expediency."
