    "body": "So much was asked of Attorney General Bill Barr (“Thank You, Bill Barr,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 15). The American people needed him to identify the corruption in Washington, hold officials accountable for the Russia hoax and alert voters that Joe Biden’s son was under investigation. Mr. Barr did none of this. His tenure must be judged a failure.<br />Steve Gidumal<br />New York<br /><br />Wholly omitted from your editorial is any mention that Mr. Barr auditioned for the attorney general job by sending an unsolicited 20-page memo to the Justice Department blasting the special counsel’s investigation into the president’s obstruction of justice. There is nothing about Mr. Barr ordering John Gore of the Justice Department to defy a congressional subpoena, or that Mr. Barr was held in contempt of Congress. No discussion about Mr. Barr pre-emptively and prophylactically summarizing the special counsel’s report for the public."
