    "body": "A few years ago in a moment of terror, I called my Uncle Sidney. Hurricane Irma was bearing down on South Florida, where I live, forecast as a Category 5. I didn’t evacuate because I planned to report on the aftermath. Much of what I hold dear—my family, home and beloved old sailboat—was in its path.<br />Uncle Sidney—a former surgeon and Vietnam veteran, who lost a son and whose parents lived through poverty in the Great Depression—listened to me pour out my fears for a few minutes. When he spoke, he was direct: “Pull yourself together,” he said. “You need to be the person your 17-year-old self always wanted you to be.”<br />My uncle reminded me of how badly I’d wanted to be a writer and to be adventurous. He called the storm an “opportunity of a lifetime” for a reporter. And he told me to focus. “Go find your safety,” he said. “Then suck it up and start composing.”<br />Think of the best advice you’ve received. Chances are it came from someone older and wiser, who knows a thing or two about getting through tough times. You’ve probably channeled it during the pandemic—just as I’ve done with Uncle Sidney’s guidance.<br />As we close out this toughest of years, I asked readers to share the best hard-times advice they ever got from an older family member or friend. Here it is."
