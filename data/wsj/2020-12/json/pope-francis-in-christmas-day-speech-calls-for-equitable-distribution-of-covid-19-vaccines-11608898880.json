    "body": "ROME—Pope Francis on Friday called for international solidarity in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, especially through the equitable distribution of vaccines.<br />The pope made his remarks in his annual Christmas Day speech, which traditionally highlights wars, natural disasters and humanitarian crises around the world.<br />Pope Francis said the new Covid-19 vaccines were cause for hope but that they must be available to all countries and people.<br />“We must not allow closed nationalisms to impede us from living as the true human family that we are,” the pope said. “Nor must we allow the virus of radical individualism to defeat us and render us indifferent to the suffering of other brothers and sisters. I cannot put myself before others, putting the laws of the market and patents above the laws of love and the health of humanity.”<br />“I plead with all the leaders of states, businesses and international organizations to promote cooperation and not competition and to seek a solution for all, vaccines for all, especially the most vulnerable and needy,” he added."
