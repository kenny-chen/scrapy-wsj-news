    "body": "Huntington Bancshares Inc.  agreed to merge with  TCF Financial Corp.  in the latest in a recent string of regional-bank tie-ups.<br />The companies on Sunday announced an all-stock deal, confirming an earlier report by The Wall Street Journal. It would be one of the larger recent bank combinations, valuing Detroit-based TCF at nearly $6 billion, or about an 11% premium. Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington has a market value of $13 billion.<br />Together, the banks would have about $170 billion in assets, with a network of branches that stretches from Pennsylvania to Arizona and is especially concentrated in Midwestern states such as Illinois and Michigan.<br />The deal, if completed, would vault Huntington closer to its fiercest in-state competitors,  Fifth Third Bancorp  and  Key Corp. , which have about $200 billion and $170 billion in assets, respectively.<br />TCF’s nine-state network would add about 475 new branches and five states where Huntington lacks a physical presence. Huntington’s 839 branches are spread across seven states."
