    "body": "The number of shooting victims in New York City more than doubled in 2020, with low-income and minority communities hardest hit by gun violence.<br />New York Police Department officials say the surge in shootings this year is greater than any rise the city has seen in years, and it has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Between Jan. 1 and Dec. 20, the city recorded 1,824 shooting victims, up nearly 104% from 896 during the same period a year earlier, according to NYPD data.<br />The number of shootings increased to 1,493 for the year so far, compared with 754 for the same time in 2019, the data showed. A single shooting could end up with more than one victim, which accounts for the difference in totals between victims and incidents.<br />The Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice said people of color accounted for most of the victims.<br />An analysis of NYPD data by that office showed that 1,440 of 1,495 shooting victims between Jan. 1 to Oct. 1, or 96%, were either Black or Hispanic. During that period, 29 shooting victims were white."
