    "body": "House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy called for Rep. Eric Swalwell to be removed from office over allegations that the lawmaker was targeted by a suspected Chinese spy, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to rise to the defense of her fellow California Democrat.<br />Mr. Swalwell was named in a report by Axios earlier this week that said a Chinese intelligence operative developed ties with local and national California politicians, in what U.S. officials believe was a political intelligence operation.<br />The operative, known as Fang Fang or Christine Fang, fundraised for Mr. Swalwell’s 2014 re-election campaign and helped put an intern in his office, according to the report. It said Mr. Swalwell hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, or of sharing any classified information. Mr. Swalwell said on CNN that he was told about Ms. Fang and offered to help with the investigation.<br />“All I did was cooperate and the FBI said that yesterday,” Mr. Swalwell said Wednesday. He didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Wall Street Journal.<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment on details of the case involving Ms. Fang, but an official confirmed that the FBI had briefed Mr. Swalwell on the issue. “Congressman Swalwell was completely cooperative and he was under no suspicion of wrongdoing,” the official said."
