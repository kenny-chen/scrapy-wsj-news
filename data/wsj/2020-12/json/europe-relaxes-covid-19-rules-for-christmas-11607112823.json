    "body": "Many European countries are planning to relax restrictions on travel and social contacts for the Christmas and New Year period despite still-high levels of coronavirus infections, bowing to public pressure to allow more family gatherings.<br />France, Spain, the U.K. and parts of Germany have all said they would loosen some travel rules within their countries so that people can see their relatives, allowing more travel between regions or freer use of hotels.<br />Some governments are also allowing more people to meet than they have in recent weeks while still setting limits to gatherings, to try to keep holiday infections as low as possible and protect elderly people who are most vulnerable to Covid-19.<br />The mix of measures shows the delicate balancing act that governments face in trying to maintain public adherence to social distancing without triggering a backlash from Europeans who are frustrated with months of restrictions on daily life.<br />Coronavirus infections are declining in much of Europe after reaching a peak last month. But public-health experts and some governments are worried that too much relaxation over the coming holiday period could trigger another rebound in contagion."
