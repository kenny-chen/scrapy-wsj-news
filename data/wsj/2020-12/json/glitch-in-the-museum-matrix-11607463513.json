    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Why go to an art museum? Yes, you can usually get a good lunch there, but this isn’t a trick question: You go there to look at great art, delight in it and learn more about it. Very few of us will ever own a Manet or a Mark Rothko, but you can see examples of their work hanging in American museums from coast to coast, an experience that is nothing like looking at a reproduction in a coffee-table book. Or, at least, you could see them: The Covid-19 pandemic has forced many major art museums to close or sharply limit their viewing capacity, and many art lovers are now understandably reluctant to visit those museums that remain open.<br />How, then, can people who love art continue to enrich their aesthetic lives in something like the manner to which they’re accustomed? New York’s Museum of Modern Art has a very good answer. “Virtual Views: Van Gogh’s ‘Starry Night’” is an online “exhibition” devoted to one of MoMA’s most familiar and best-loved paintings. It includes an introductory video and a Q&A session with Ann Temkin, the museum’s chief curator of painting and sculpture, followed by a “performative reading” by the actor-playwright Anna Deavere Smith of the correspondence between Vincent van Gogh and his brother Theo. The package also includes several other choice items, including “a cosmologist’s take on the painting’s famous sky.”"
