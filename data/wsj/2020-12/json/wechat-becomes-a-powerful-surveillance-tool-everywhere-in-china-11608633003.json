    "body": "China’s do-everything app,  WeChat ,  has become one of the most powerful tools in Beijing’s arsenal for monitoring the public, censoring speech and punishing people who voice discontent with the government.<br />Authorities are increasingly using the app from  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  to justify arrests or issue threats, say dissidents, consumers and security researchers.<br />Wang Shengsheng, a labor and women’s rights lawyer, said authorities were monitoring her  WeChat  and text messages earlier this year so they could gather evidence to thwart her legal career.<br />Local public security and party discipline officials in her hometown also tracked down her father as part of their efforts to tarnish her reputation, she said.<br />“People always say that all of your communications on  WeChat  are out in the open. I never fully grasped what that meant until the recent incident,” she said. “Now I’m terrified.”"
