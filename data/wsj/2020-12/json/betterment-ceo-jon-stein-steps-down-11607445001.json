    "body": "Betterment LLC founder Jon Stein is stepping down as chief executive, the investment-advice company said Tuesday. He will be succeeded by Sarah Kirshbaum Levy, a former executive of  ViacomCBS Inc.<br />Ms. Levy, who will assume the job today, will be charged with steering the company to a possible initial public offering over the next few years, said Mr. Stein, who will stay on day-to-day through the end of the month and remain chairman of the board.<br />Mr. Stein, 41, founded the digital investment advisory company in 2010. The New York based firm manages $25 billion with more than 550,000 customers.<br />“We have record revenues and despite Covid are seeing growth in all three of our business lines,” which consist of retail investment advice, 401(k)s for small and midsize firms, and a platform for independent investment advisers, Mr. Stein said in an interview. “It feels like a good point to pass the torch.”<br />His replacement, Ms. Levy, was chief operating officer of ViacomCBS’s media networks from Jan. 2018 to Jan. 2020. The 49-year-old executive served in a variety of roles, including COO at the company’s Nickelodeon unit from 1998 to 2017."
