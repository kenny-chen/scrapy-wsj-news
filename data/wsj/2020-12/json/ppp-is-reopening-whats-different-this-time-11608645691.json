    "body": "The Paycheck Protection Program is getting a reboot as part of Congress’s latest coronavirus stimulus package. The $900 billion deal includes $284 billion for PPP, which will reopen after closing in August. Much like the program’s first iteration, the aid will be in the form of forgivable loans to small firms, but there will be some key changes on issues such as eligibility for second-time applicants and types of forgivable expenses. Here’s what we know so far.<br />Businesses, some nonprofit organizations, self-employed workers and independent contractors are among those eligible. Existing PPP borrowers may apply for a second loan, provided they have 300 or fewer employees and can demonstrate they experienced a 25% reduction in gross receipts during a quarter in 2020 compared with the same quarter in 2019. First-time PPP borrowers will be subject to the program’s original eligibility rules, according to a senior staffer for Republicans on the House Small Business Committee. The original PPP was generally open to businesses with up to 500 employees, and there was no requirement to demonstrate a revenue loss. More restrictive requirements for second loans reflect a consensus among lawmakers that the program’s restart should focus on businesses that have been hardest hit.<br />The maximum for second-draw loans is $2 million, less than the $10 million cap for PPP’s first round. Loan amounts will be based on an applicant’s payroll, consistent with the program’s first iteration.<br />Second-time PPP borrowers will generally be eligible to borrow an amount equal to 2½ times their average monthly payroll costs. A notable exception: Applicants in the accommodation and food services industries, as designated by the Small Business Administration, are eligible for loans that amount to 3½ times their average monthly payroll. These industries have been hit especially hard by the pandemic.<br />Borrowers are still required to spend at least 60% of the funds on payroll to receive full forgiveness. The other 40% may be used on eligible costs. As before, these costs include certain mortgage expenses, rent and utility payments. The bill expands forgivable expenses to include expenditures for personal protective equipment and other gear to protect workers; supplier costs; operations expenditures, such as software; and property damage costs due to public disturbances during 2020."
