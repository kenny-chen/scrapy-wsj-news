    "body": "State leaders say they are short billions of dollars in funding needed to successfully provide Covid-19 vaccinations to all Americans who want to be inoculated by health officials’ June goal.<br />The federal government is providing the vaccine, along with syringes, needles, face masks and shields. But state leaders say they must hire medical workers, provide community outreach and education, set up vaccination clinics and ensure storage capacity for vaccines. Some states are also concerned about having enough supplies, such as gloves and gowns, to protect health-care workers as well as people getting vaccinated.<br />Officials in several states said they would spend whatever is needed to get residents vaccinated. Some said that might force spending cuts in areas like education, unless Congress provides additional funding or the federal government reimburses a large chunk of their rollout costs.<br />Congressional lawmakers have been wrestling with a potential $908 billion coronavirus relief package, and aid to state and local governments has been a sticking point.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent more than $300 million to states to support flu and Covid-19 vaccine planning, according to a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services."
