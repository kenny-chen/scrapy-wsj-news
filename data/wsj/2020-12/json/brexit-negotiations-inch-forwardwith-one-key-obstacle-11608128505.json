    "body": "BRUSSELS—Negotiators moved closer to an agreement on the future relationship between the U.K. and European Union, officials from both sides said, though they remained far apart on a major stumbling block: access by EU boats to British waters.<br />With just over two weeks to reach and ratify a deal covering economic, trade and security arrangements, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told EU lawmakers it remains impossible to say with certainty whether an agreement is coming together.<br />Failure to reach a deal would mean from Jan. 1 tariffs would be applied for the first time in almost a half-century on some trade between the U.K. and the EU. The U.K. sends 43% of its exports to the bloc.<br />But in comments that echoed views of people involved in the negotiations, Mrs. von der Leyen checked off a series of issues where the two sides have narrowed or resolved differences linked to a central EU demand: that the U.K. commit to standards on issues such as state aid, labor and environmental regulation that will ensure fair competition once Britain leaves the bloc.<br />That includes progress on defining the rules around U.K. state-aid decisions and their enforcement, and the ability of the EU to take punitive action if the agreement is breached."
