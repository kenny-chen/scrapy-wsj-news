    "body": "WASHINGTON—A bipartisan agreement to prevent patients from receiving surprise medical bills was expected to be included in a year-end legislative package being completed in Congress, according to aides, after more than two years of negotiation.<br />A group of four House and Senate committees last week released a bipartisan agreement to install new patient protections and establish a new system for resolving billing disputes. Lawmakers this week pushed colleagues to support adding it to the broader year-end spending and Covid 19-aid legislation.<br />Surprise billing typically occurs when a patient is treated at a hospital in his or her insurance network by a medical professional who isn’t, potentially leading to crippling medical charges.<br />“It’s the broadest solution we’ll ever have on that important issue,” Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), the retiring chairman of the Senate Health Committee, told reporters Thursday. Mr. Alexander indicated that whether to include the agreement was now up to the four congressional leaders. “It’s been very thoroughly vetted in many hearings in many committees, so it’s time to end the discussion,” he said.<br />Sens. Bill Cassidy (R., La.) and Maggie Hassan (D., N.H.), both members of the health committee, sent a letter Tuesday signed by 25 other senators to Senate leaders, urging them to include the agreement in the year-end package. Congressional leaders hope to bundle together a full-year spending bill, an emerging coronavirus relief package, and other issues where there is bipartisan consensus."
