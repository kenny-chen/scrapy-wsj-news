    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said that Congress should take up a coronavirus relief bill that excludes Republican and Democratic priorities that currently lack bipartisan agreement and instead address those issues in an additional package next year.<br />Mr. McConnell on Tuesday said lawmakers should set aside aid for state and local governments and liability protections, two issues that have bedeviled lawmakers in the year-end effort to pass another aid package. He made the comments  as both parties are eager to strike a deal quickly but struggled to agree on details.<br />Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) rejected Mr. McConnell’s idea and accused him of trying to sabotage talks. He is “trying to pull the rug out from beneath” the negotiators, Mr. Schumer said.<br />In another development, Trump administration officials asked Senate Republicans to press to include $600 direct checks in any relief package, according to people familiar with the discussions. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin advocated for the $600 check, half the size of the first round of checks, while Mr. Trump would be willing to include a larger check, the people said. The current bipartisan framework doesn’t include any such direct payments.<br />Mr. McConnell said that a package this year should focus on money for vaccine distribution, health-care providers and small businesses, pointing to President-elect Joe Biden’s plans to work on another relief package in his administration as another opportunity to work out the outstanding issues."
