    "body": "A tumultuous year in oil markets left the energy industry reeling and gave fresh impetus to a perennial debate: What is the best gauge of crude prices?<br />The Covid-19 pandemic confined billions of people to their homes and shut or slowed portions of the global economy in 2020, crimping demand for oil. Depots, pipelines and vessels were flooded with crude, threatening to overwhelm the world’s ability to store it.<br />The crisis reached its crescendo in April, when the price of light, sweet U.S. crude futures dived below $0 a barrel for the first time. Some traders were paying others to take oil off their hands.<br />“What we saw was the single largest demand event in history,” said Peter Keavey, managing director for energy products at  CME  Group, owner of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where U.S. crude futures trade.<br />Prices have since somewhat recovered. But those jarring moves of the spring added urgency to arguments about whether benchmarks used since the 1980s adequately reflect the modern oil market. Newer gauges, including Shanghai-traded futures and a contract for Abu Dhabi’s Murban crude that will make its debut in March, are expected to grow in popularity."
