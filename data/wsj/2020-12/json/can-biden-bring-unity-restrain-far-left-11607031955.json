    "body": "William Galston’s recommendations to Joe Biden (“Biden’s Tough Job: Uniting Americans,” Politics & Ideas, Nov. 18) offer several areas of compromise and a more thoughtful approach to governing, but like many similar polemics, fall short by their limited scope.<br />To reunite America, we must return to legitimate governing that respects our system and the laws as they exist. To accomplish this, Joe Biden should submit the Dreamer exception, which President Obama initiated via executive order, to the legislative process where its violation of current law can be dealt with; promise to submit the Iran nuclear agreement to the Senate for ratification if he decides to reinstate it and, finally, apply the same treatment to any climate-change agreements he wishes to join that bind the U.S. to action. These would be powerful steps in returning the nation to the constitutional government that has both unified us in the past and propelled us to unimagined stability and prosperity.<br />Lt. Col. Fritz Mehrtens, USA (Ret.)<br />Irvine, Calif.<br />"
