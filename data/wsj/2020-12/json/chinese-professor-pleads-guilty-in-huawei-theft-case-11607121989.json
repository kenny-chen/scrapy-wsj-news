    "body": "A professor accused of stealing technology for Huawei Technologies Co. pleaded guilty Friday to lying to federal agents, ending a chapter in the Justice Department’s investigation into both the giant Chinese firm and allegedly illegal actions by China-linked academics in the U.S.<br />Last fall, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged the professor, Bo Mao, with conspiring to commit wire fraud, accusing him of using his position as an academic researcher at University of Texas-Arlington to secretly advance Huawei’s technology. As part of the plea, that count will be dismissed.<br />Mr. Mao admitted to lying to federal agents about whether anyone at the Texas university possessed certain unique technology. He will be sentenced to time served plus supervised release, according to the agreement discussed in court. Mr. Mao has spent a week in jail.<br />A Huawei spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Mao’s plea.<br />The spokesman has previously said that charges against the firm are unfounded and unfair."
