    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. on Tuesday blacklisted several Chinese companies for allegedly helping North Korea export its coal, part of a renewed effort by the Trump administration to stem critical revenue sources for Kim Jong Un’s regime.<br />The Treasury Department sanctioned six companies, including four Chinese firms and four ships they own, that officials said show China’s government is failing to adequately enforce United Nations sanctions against North Korea.<br />The sanctions block any assets the companies have within U.S. jurisdiction and could complicate their dealings overseas, including the ships’ ability to transport goods.<br />Tuesday’s action follows the November blacklisting of several Russian companies the Treasury said are exporting North Korean laborers to Russia and China, as well as a new reward program offering up to $5 million for reports on sanctions-evasion by Pyongyang and its facilitators.<br />The Treasury Department said Chinese authorities must implement and enforce the U.N. Security Council resolutions, including by taking action against companies, individuals, and vessels that engage in prohibited trade. Tensions between the two world powers over North Korea have added to diplomatic friction over a range of economic and national security issues, including sanctions against top Chinese officials levied by the U.S. Monday for what it says is Beijing’s erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy."
