    "body": "WASHINGTON—Lawmakers considering a fresh round of financial aid for small businesses are focusing on firms with fewer employees that could show they have been hurt by the pandemic-triggered downturn, addressing criticisms that dogged the Paycheck Protection Program.<br />“Let us target the program to the smaller of the small businesses. Let’s make sure it’s based upon need, so that we get to the small businesses that really need help,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, during a Congressional hearing last week.<br />A bipartisan proposal for a broader, $908 billion coronavirus-aid bill includes $300 billion for the Small Business Administration and a restart of the PPP, which closed in August. The plan would limit loans to businesses that have 300 or fewer employees and can demonstrate that they sustained a 30% revenue loss in any quarter of 2020.<br />Such requirements would mark a departure from the program’s first iteration, which was launched in April and provided $525 billion in forgivable loans for firms to cover payroll and some overhead costs.<br />That PPP was designed to get money out quickly as the pandemic shut down swaths of the economy. It was generally open to businesses with up to 500 employees, and applicants only had to attest that economic uncertainty made the funds necessary to support operations."
