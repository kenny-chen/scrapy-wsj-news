    "body": "Target Corp.  is the latest company to sue major poultry producers, accusing them of price-fixing practices that allegedly led to inflated prices of chicken.<br />The retailer, in a lawsuit filed Friday with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, said it is seeking damages—the amount to be determined at trial—and payment of legal fees.<br />The suit, in line with previously filed cases, alleges that top chicken suppliers, including Claxton Poultry Farms, Fieldale Farms Corp., Perdue Farms Inc.,  Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. ,  Sanderson Farms Inc.  and  Tyson Foods Inc.,  collectively reduced production to hike prices and coordinated pricing for meat supplies.<br />Representatives for Fieldale, Perdue and Tyson said the companies deny the allegations. Claxton and Sanderson representatives declined to comment. Pilgrim’s Pride didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />Chick-fil-A Inc., the chicken-sandwich giant, also sued the poultry producers in a lawsuit filed Friday. The suits are the latest in the four-year legal battle over alleged collusion among companies that produce the bulk of the roughly 37 billion pounds of chicken consumed annually in the U.S."
