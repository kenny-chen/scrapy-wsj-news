    "body": "Graham T. Allison correctly highlights the importance of competitive private enterprise in developing Covid-19 vaccines (“Who Made the Vaccine Possible? Not WHO,” op-ed, Dec. 24) but glosses over the primary importance of publicly funded basic research. That is, research not motivated by practical applications and not conducted by private companies, but motivated by the simple goal of understanding how the natural world works and conducted largely in public institutions.<br />Second is the essential role of governments and public funding, not only to support the basic research, but also to provide the legal framework essential for a market economy. I don’t deny the crucial role of private enterprise from that point onward, but to conclude that pharmaceutical companies and Operation Warp Speed deserve the vast bulk of the credit for the development of the vaccines is a selective reading of how science works.<br />William Horns<br />Fitchburg, Wis.<br />"
