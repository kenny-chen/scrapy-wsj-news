    "body": "Your editorial “The Dow Hits 30,000” (Nov. 25) notes that since the 2016 election the Dow has increased from 18,000. Before we celebrate too much, should we consider that in that same period total public debt has increased from $18 trillion to $27 trillion (a 50% increase) while America’s corporate debt is approaching $11 trillion and consumer debt rose to over $14 trillion through the first quarter of 2020? Is this just a case of the debits equaling the credits? What happens when all this forward spending ceases or, heaven forbid, has to be paid back? What happens to the Dow Jones Industrial average then?<br />Mark R. Spencer<br />Flagstaff, Ariz."
