    "body": "It will be a puritan sort of Christmas for most of us this year: confined to our homes, maintaining a distance from each other, avoiding public revelry on penalty of a hefty fine. If you do go to church, remember—no singing, by order of the elders. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is not the first flamboyantly coiffed authoritarian governor-protector in history to ban the singing of Christmas carols. But at least Oliver Cromwell never went near a French laundry, as far as we know.<br />“The feast of Christ’s nativity is spent in reveling, dicing, carding, masking, and in all licentious liberty . . . by mad mirth, by long eating, by hard drinking, by lewd gaming, by rude reveling!” Cotton Mather declaimed from his pulpit in 1712, denouncing the traditional Christmas celebrations of the time.<br />I can’t speak to the lewd gaming anyone may have been planning this year, but other than the “masking”—which, in an odd inversion of the rules of officially approved behavior is now mandatory rather than proscribed—Mather’s early 18th-century injunctions are pretty much in place in the 21st. That’s progressivism for you.<br />The prospect of a good old Cotton Mather Yuletide is a fitting end to a year in which the puritanical tendency has again entrenched itself as the dominant force in American politics.<br />The modern left’s mission to extirpate sin from society is the product of a secular religion of the most austere sort."
