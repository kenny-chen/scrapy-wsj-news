    "body": "Regarding Chester E. Finn Jr.’s “A Progressive Assault on Selective High Schools” (op-ed, Nov. 27): Ironically, eliminating the test-based admission process for entry to the country’s elite high schools would hurt the ethnic groups that its proponents are trying to help. Children from wealthy families will always have access to high-achieving schools, but for low-income families of all races the exam schools are their best chance for an equally high-level education. Eliminating the admission tests would destroy the elite schools and eliminate the only chance that poor, especially inner-city students have of receiving an education equal or better than that offered by the private city and wealthy suburban schools.<br />A well-designed exam measures not only what a student has learned but, more importantly, their capacity to learn new things. This is especially important for boys whose maturity level often lags behind their intellectual ability. The elite public schools have turned millions of poor children of all races into today’s leaders.<br />Every child should be academically challenged at a level they can handle. Attending an elite school is only one of many paths to success in life.<br />André Montero<br />Brooklyn Technical High School, ’64"
