    "body": "Sunday began disastrously for Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. The Miami Dolphins intercepted him. They sacked him for 30 yards on one play. Then they intercepted him again.<br />But the problem for the Dolphins was that football games don’t last one quarter. They have four quarters. And since Mahomes entered the NFL, nobody has really stopped him for four quarters.<br />Mahomes finished with 393 passing yards and two touchdowns. There was also a Tyreek Hill run for a touchdown, a Mecole Hardman punt return for a score and a safety by the defense. By the time the game was over, the Chiefs had turned a 10-0 deficit into a 30-10 lead that ended in a 33-27 win against a playoff-caliber team. Mahomes finished with more interceptions (three), than he had previously thrown all season (two), and they still won with ease.<br />It was a remarkable display of what has defined the Kansas City offense ever since Mahomes took over. Opponents can force incompletions, sack him and even intercept him. They can’t contain him for an entire game.<br />The swift turnaround was oddly familiar to anyone who remembered Mahomes’s last game in Miami. That was in a game called the Super Bowl—when Mahomes also rallied from 10 points down to win."
