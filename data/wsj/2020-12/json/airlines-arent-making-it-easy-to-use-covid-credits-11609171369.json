    "body": "A credit from a store is usually straightforward. A credit from an airline can be anything but: It’s often hard to use, and you may never get back all your money.<br />With billions of dollars tied up in vouchers for a pandemic’s worth of canceled flights, some airlines have created new classes of vouchers. Some have new restrictions that limit their use and value.<br />United, a target of many customer complaints, has two types of credits: travel credits and flight credits. They may sound nearly identical, but they’re quite different.<br />Travel credits, officially called electronic travel certificates, can be used for multiple trips until you use up the full value. Not so with flight credits. Starting March 3, flight credits became one shot—if you rebook for a trip less expensive than your original ticket, United pockets the difference. And guess what happens with credits and certificates if your new trip is more expensive than the original: United charges you the difference.<br />Confused? Frequent flier Karen Moraghan was when she ended up with a $1,200 United flight credit and tried to use it on a $700 rebooking, only to learn she’d lose the remaining $500."
