    "body": "When a Christian believer says “Merry Christmas,” the message conveys personal feelings, beliefs and a value system. If the response is “Merry Christmas” right back, those who exchange the wishes likely are kindred spirits. Awkward moments with some nonbelievers or people with other religious beliefs tend to be brief and manageable. No harm, no foul.<br />Stephen Ford encourages us to go with “Happy Holidays” as a noncombative wish that reflects quiet Christian confidence (“‘Happy Holidays’ Is Pro-Christmas,” Houses of Worship, Dec. 11). Thanks, but no thanks. “Happy Holidays” has all the punch and symbolism of putting “We Trust” on U.S. dollars without the “In God.”<br />America’s destiny appears to be secular, but a “Merry Christmas” spoken with joy and love is a message that many will pass along while we still can.<br />Jeff Adams<br />Atlanta"
