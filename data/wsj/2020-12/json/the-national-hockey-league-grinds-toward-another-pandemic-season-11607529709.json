    "body": "<br />The National Hockey League is inching closer to getting back on the ice, mostly without fans, as contentious talks between franchise owners and the league’s Players’ Association have resumed with a goal of starting an abbreviated 56-game season in mid-January.<br />The move toward a new season comes amid a bruising battle over the economics of playing another pandemic season, one that could be rough for owners without substantial ticket revenues or more salary concessions from skaters.<br />The NHL season normally begins in October, but the traditional schedule has been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. The 2019-20 season only finished in late September after being interrupted in March.<br />To get moving again, the league needs about a three-week ramp up to allow players to quarantine upon repatriating to their home markets and then participate in training camps, according to people familiar with the matter. Should an agreement between the league and players be reached by the end of the week, games could resume as soon as January 13."
