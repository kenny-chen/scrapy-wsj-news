    "body": "As traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers continue to endure sales declines, Stitch Fix’s quarterly results released Monday afternoon show how the experience of shopping for clothes could be changing for good.<br />Stitch Fix said that, in addition to double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter ended Oct. 31, it saw the highest sequential net client additions in its history. Investors sent its shares surging 42% Tuesday morning following the report.<br />That reaction is likely less a reflection of the quarter itself—revenue growth of 10% was a far cry from the 21% pace Stitch Fix posted for the comparable period last year—and more the expectation that record client growth will pay off later. It likely also was exaggerated by very high short interest in the stock heading into earnings. The company still has to show that it can improve margins.<br />Stitch Fix, which offers algorithmically personalized clothing with the help of a stylist, for years has been asking new clients to ditch decade-old habits of trying clothing on in a store before paying for it. For the first several months of the pandemic, it seemed this was too big of an ask for many shoppers. Stitch Fix’s sales in the quarter ended Aug. 1 grew just 3% from a year earlier after falling by more than 9% in the prior period.<br />But the company’s latest results suggest that many more consumers are coming around, and it is happening just as a window of opportunity is about to close: When more shoppers feel comfortable visiting shopping malls as Covid-19 cases recede, Stitch Fix might have hooked customers for good."
