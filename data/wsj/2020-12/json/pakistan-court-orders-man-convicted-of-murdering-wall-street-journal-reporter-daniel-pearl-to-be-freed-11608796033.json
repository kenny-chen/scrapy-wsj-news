    "body": "ISLAMABAD—A Pakistani court Thursday ordered the release of the British national convicted in 2002 as the mastermind of the kidnapping and killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, according to the suspect’s lawyer and a government attorney.<br />The court in the southern city of Karachi ruled that Omar Sheikh be released from a temporary detention order that had kept him in jail since the same court overturned his conviction eight months ago, both lawyers said.<br />In April, the court set aside the death sentence handed down to Mr. Sheikh for terrorism, kidnapping for ransom, and murder, downgrading it to the lesser crime of kidnapping. As kidnapping carries a maximum of seven years in jail, and Mr. Sheikh had already been locked up for 18 years at that point, he was eligible for release.<br />Three accomplices who were sentenced to life in prison at the same 2002 trial had their convictions completely overturned in the April ruling.<br />However, Mr. Sheikh and the three others remained in prison after Pakistani authorities used emergency detention powers."
