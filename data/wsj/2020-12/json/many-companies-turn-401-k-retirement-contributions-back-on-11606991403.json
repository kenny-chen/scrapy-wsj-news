    "body": "More companies that cut the contributions they made to employees’ 401(k) retirement plans earlier this year are reversing course as their businesses rebound and a Covid-19 vaccine is on the horizon.<br />Consider  Quest Diagnostics Inc.  The lab testing company suspended the matching contributions it made to its $4.59 billion 401(k) plan in April, as part of a cost-cutting initiative due to reductions in testing volumes.<br />But when patients returned to medical appointments this summer and Quest’s business recovered, it restarted those contributions on Aug. 23, four months sooner than planned.<br />“We reinstated to normalcy,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Guinan said on a recent call with Wall Street analysts.<br />Quest isn’t alone in restoring the status quo for employees."
