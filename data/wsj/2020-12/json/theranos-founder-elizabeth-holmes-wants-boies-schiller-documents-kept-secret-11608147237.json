    "body": "Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes is fighting to keep jurors in her coming fraud trial from seeing emails and other documents tied to the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, arguing they are protected communications with her lawyers.<br />Ms. Holmes and former top Theranos executive Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani are facing charges of defrauding investors in the defunct blood-testing startup out of hundreds of millions of dollars and deceiving patients about the reliability of Theranos tests.<br />Ms. Holmes is slated to go to trial in early March, with Mr. Balwani’s trial to follow at a later date. They have both pleaded not guilty to charges that could send them to prison for 20 years.<br />Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office for the Northern District of California said during a Wednesday court hearing that the 13 documents at issue weren’t protected by attorney-client privilege because they stemmed from work Boies Schiller lawyers were doing for Theranos as a company, not Ms. Holmes personally.<br />The emails, sent from 2013 to 2016, haven’t been publicly disclosed but generally discuss how Theranos should respond to the media, investors and regulators, court filings show. Most deal with potential legal action Boies Schiller was helping Ms. Holmes pursue against The Wall Street Journal, Lance Wade, an attorney for Ms. Holmes, told a federal judge Wednesday."
