    "body": "More than 1,000 Honduran migrants headed toward Guatemala on Thursday, seeking to reach the U.S. southern border after two hurricanes brought economic devastation to the country’s poor.<br />Most members of the migrant caravan that departed on Wednesday night from the bus terminal of San Pedro Sula are betting that the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden will roll back some of the Trump administration’s restrictive immigration policies.<br />“We have asked God to help us and we believe that the new U.S. government will let us in,” said Bertha Méndez, a 25-year-old homemaker who had been living in a shack made up of plastic sheets and cardboard after heavy rains destroyed her house in the northern municipality of Choloma.<br />“I travel with eight people and we all think that this is a good opportunity, because it is the only thing we have left after having lost everything in the floods,” Ms. Méndez added. She expects to reach the U.S. before the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration.<br />But workers who assist migrants along the routes heading north believe the caravan has little chance of reaching U.S. soil. In October, thousands of Honduran migrants were blocked by Guatemalan security officers as they headed to Mexico. The Mexican government that month also deployed security forces at busy border crossings with Guatemala to prevent migrants from entering illegally."
