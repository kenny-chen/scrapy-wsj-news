    "body": "One January night in 1761, little Wolfgang Mozart insisted on playing a challenging harpsichord piece he had just heard performed by his older sister, already a virtuoso. He had never played a keyboard before. At the beginning of “Mozart: The Reign of Love” (don’t let the sappy subtitle put you off), the esteemed composer and biographer Jan Swafford writes:<br /><br /><br />Three years later, on his first visit to London, the prodigy, it was reported, was rolling around on a table when someone handed him a song by Johann Christian Bach. “The boy glanced at the score upside down, pointed out a wrongly copied note, and continued his roll on the table.”<br />Mr. Swafford delights in repeating these stories—it’s one of the pleasures of this comprehensive and engaging biography. He is thoroughly up-to-date on the latest information and controversies, debunking the still commonly held mythology about the composer, and he continually reminds us of what astounding music Mozart wrote: “No artist,” Mr. Swafford asserts, “made more of pleasure—made it deeper, more liberated, more sensual.”"
