    "body": "Sen. David Perdue, a Republican seeking re-election in a Georgia runoff next week, is quarantining after coming into close contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19, his campaign said Thursday.<br />The results of the runoff election Tuesday will determine which party controls the Senate.<br />The Perdue campaign said in a statement that the senator was notified Thursday that someone on the campaign had tested positive for the coronavirus. While Mr. Perdue and his wife tested negative Thursday, they will quarantine in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, the campaign said.<br />Mr. Perdue and fellow Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler are each competing to retain their seats after no Georgia Senate candidate reached the 50% threshold required to win in the November election.<br />Currently, the Senate is set to have 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats. If either or both of the Georgia Republicans win, their party will maintain its Senate majority. If Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock both unseat the incumbents, their party will lead the Senate because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris can cast tiebreaking votes."
