    "body": "China’s top credit-rating firm was banned from rating new bonds for three months, after an investigation found it ignored red flags at a state-owned coal miner whose default last month rattled the country’s bond market.<br />China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co. had an AAA rating on the miner when it failed to repay the equivalent of $153 million in short-term debt on Nov. 10. The default occurred just weeks after the company, Yongcheng Coal & Electricity Holding Group Co., raised the same amount from a sale of three-year-debt.<br />The series of events spooked investors, triggering price declines that pushed up bond yields and raised borrowing costs for other companies.<br />The National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors, a self-regulatory organization overseen by China’s central bank, said Chengxin failed to conduct on-site investigations and interviews with Yongcheng’s management personnel. It said the ratings firm didn’t take steps to verify and investigate delays in salary payments and debt-repayment arrangements, and didn’t adequately disclose the company’s credit risks.<br />Chengxin has been suspended from rating new interbank bond issues for three months, the NAFMII said. It also faulted the credit rater’s internal controls and ordered the company to conduct “comprehensive and profound rectification.”"
