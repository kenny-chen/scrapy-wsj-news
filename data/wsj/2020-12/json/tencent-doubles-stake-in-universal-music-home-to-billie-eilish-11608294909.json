Universal’s stable also includes classic acts such as Queen and the Beatles, and it recently boughtBob Dylan’s entire publishing catalog.<br />The purchase comes nearly a year after the Tencent-led consortium, which includes its streaming business  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  and other undisclosed investors, first bought a 10% stake in Universal. That deal included an option to buy an additional stake of up to 10% at the same valuation.<br />Tencent and Vivendi also signed a separate agreement in March enabling Tencent Music to acquire a minority stake in the Universal subsidiary that owns the record label’s Greater China operations."
