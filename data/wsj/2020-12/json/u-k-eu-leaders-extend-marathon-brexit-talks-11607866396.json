    "body": "BRUSSELS—The U.K. and European Union agreed “to go the extra mile” and keep negotiating over a new economic and security relationship, after previously saying they would decide by Sunday whether to call off the talks.<br />Britain, which left the EU on Jan. 31, remains part of the bloc’s economic and security arrangements until the end of the year and negotiators are striving to find agreement on managing their relationship from the new year.<br />The decision to keep talking came after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke by telephone midday Sunday. A dinner meeting between them on Wednesday night ended with their both professing pessimism about the likelihood of getting a deal. They set Sunday as the day they would decide whether talks were worth pursuing.<br />A joint statement from the two leaders didn’t give any indication the talks had made progress, though officials from both sides said the negotiations had been intensive and some were hopeful a deal could now be struck. Talks will continue through Sunday.<br />“Despite the exhaustion after almost a year of negotiations, despite the fact that deadlines have been missed over and over we think it is responsible at this point to go the extra mile,” the joint statement said."
