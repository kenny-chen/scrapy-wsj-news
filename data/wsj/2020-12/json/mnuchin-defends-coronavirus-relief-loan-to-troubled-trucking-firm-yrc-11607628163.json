    "body": "WASHINGTON—Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended the government’s decision to lend $700 million in coronavirus-relief funds to trucking firm  YRC Worldwide Inc.,  telling a congressional oversight panel Thursday that taxpayers will profit from the loan.<br />Members of the bipartisan Congressional Oversight Commission, the watchdog group monitoring Treasury loan programs, have questioned how the Overland Park, Kan.-based firm was able to qualify for government aid despite its precarious financial position before the pandemic.<br />Mr. Mnuchin acknowledged the loan was risky and said he was under pressure from lawmakers to extend credit to struggling firms, even if it meant losing money.<br />“If my bank had been underwriting this loan, we would not be making this loan,” said Mr. Mnuchin, who served as chairman of OneWest Bank before joining the Trump administration. “That doesn’t mean I don't think we’re secured and we’ll get our money back.”<br />YRC, one of the nation’s largest trucking companies, qualified for the aid through a $17 billion loan program for firms deemed critical to maintaining national security. The Treasury Department has said it made the national-security decision based on a recommendation and guidance from then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper."
