    "body": "On the Caviar food-delivery app for San Francisco, a double ShackBurger from  Shake Shack  is listed at $8.99, the same price it costs in-store. Yet by the time it reaches your door, it costs $18.91. Here’s the breakdown of nearly $10 in added charges:<br /><br />During the pandemic, people have been willing to pay the delivery upcharge as a way to exercise caution while procuring meals and groceries. Following the first round of shelter-in-place orders, suburbs drove the first profitable quarter for  DoorDash Inc.,  which owns Caviar. In April, Instacart Inc. experienced a 500% year-over-year increase in grocery orders. The company’s contractor shoppers became front-line workers overnight.<br />As states renew restrictions on indoor dining and extend stay-at-home orders across the country, delivery is top of mind once again. But consumers are growing wary of the inflated cost of delivery, and companies are offering users better deals, in exchange for loyalty. What is the best way to save money? Pay attention to the details.<br />Fees aren’t the only source of extra costs. The prices of individual items can be padded too.  Costco ,  for instance, doesn’t require its Instacart grocery-delivery customers to hold a $60-a-year membership the way in-store shoppers must, but it does charge higher prices on Instacart than in its warehouse, on top of surcharges."
