    "body": "The U.S. government’s planned $332 million sale of an exclusive property in Hong Kong was thrown into doubt by the Chinese government, which has determined that the transaction needs its  approval.<br />In September, the U.S. reached a deal to sell a residential compound for consulate staff to  Hang Lung Properties Ltd. , a Hong Kong real-estate developer. The scenic property, in a high-end neighborhood called Shouson Hill, includes six low-rise buildings with 26 apartments and a rooftop swimming pool.<br />A representative of the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong previously said the sale of the Shouson Hill compound was purely the result of a business decision, made as part of a global reinvestment program by the State Department.<br />The deal didn’t close on Dec. 30 as scheduled. On Wednesday, Hang Lung said it was informed last week by Hong Kong’s Land Registry that the sale can’t be completed without the written consent of the Chinese government.<br />China’s imposition of a national-security law on Hong Kong this year has helped stoke tensions between Washington and Beijing. The Trump administration in recent months has imposed sanctions on senior government officials in China and Hong Kong for actions that the U.S. said have eroded Hong Kong’s autonomy."
