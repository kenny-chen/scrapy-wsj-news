    "body": "After the 2008 crisis, households and firms spent years rebuilding their finances in what economist Richard Koo dubbed a “balance-sheet recession.” Debt levels have jumped again this time round, but on closer reading, the books tell a more positive story.<br />Due to Covid-19, the borrowings of U.S. nonfinancial companies were 8.5% higher at the end of September than a year earlier, when they were already above the 2009 peak both in absolute levels and as a percentage of gross domestic product. Some publicly-backed programs won’t need to be paid back in full, but many investors are still worried.<br />They can afford to relax. Balance sheets are about assets as well as liabilities.<br />Flow-of-funds data recently published by the Federal Reserve shows that companies have accumulated even more cash than debt this year: Their liquid assets were up 25% in the third quarter. On a net basis, debt was down 7.9%. Relative to GDP, it remains well below 2007 levels.<br />Back then, companies and families started a long process of deleveraging that slowed the economic recovery. In the U.S., it took nine years for households to consistently increase their net debt again."
