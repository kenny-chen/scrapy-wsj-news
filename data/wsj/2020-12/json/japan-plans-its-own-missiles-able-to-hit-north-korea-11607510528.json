    "body": "TOKYO—Japan plans to develop its own missiles capable of reaching North Korea, part of a defense buildup that would give Tokyo the ability to strike if it anticipates an attack.<br />Lawmakers in Japan’s ruling party approved the missile proposal on Wednesday, and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said the military wants to strengthen weapons systems that give Japan strike capability from beyond the reach of its opponents.<br />Japan has been reviewing its defenses against Pyongyang, which is rapidly developing its own missile program including intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of hitting the U.S. Dealing with North Korea is likely to be a top challenge for President-elect Joe Biden, who has said he won’t meet leader Kim Jong Un on the same terms President Trump did.<br />While Mr. Trump largely focused on threats to the U.S. homeland, Japan is worried about shorter-range North Korean missiles, which Pyongyang frequently tested over Japanese territory before an informal moratorium prompted by a series of Trump-Kim summit meetings.<br />Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose lengthy term in power was marked by a military buildup focused on China and North Korea, made missile defense the subject of his final act in office. Just before handing the reins in September to Yoshihide Suga, Mr. Abe said Tokyo would come up with a plan by the end of the year."
