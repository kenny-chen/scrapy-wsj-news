    "body": "Kimberley Moore called  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. in October to ask if it would lower the $450 annual fee on her  United Airlines Holdings Inc.  credit card. A United cardholder for roughly 15 years, Ms. Moore traveled often. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit and Ms. Moore, 53 years old, scaled back her spending and canceled travel plans.<br />Ms. Moore, a senior director at a national health care organization in Washington, D.C., decided to keep the card after JPMorgan offered her a $200 statement credit. But she has barely used the card since, and is instead mostly using debit cards.<br />Nearly nine months into the pandemic, banks and airlines are scrambling to rescue their airline rewards cards. The companies have deployed the cards for years to win big-spending customers, but the perks they offer—like flight upgrades and airport lounge access—are all but obsolete in a global pandemic.<br />Typically, card companies don’t disclose the volume of spending on their airline cards versus other, more general-purpose cards. But travel purchases were down about 70% on  Visa Inc.  cards in the last quarter compared with a year ago. Travel and entertainment purchases were down 69% on  American Express Co.  cards.<br />Other categories are faring better. At AmEx, spending outside of travel and entertainment was up 1% in the third quarter. (AmEx says this category represents the majority of its cardholder purchases.)"
