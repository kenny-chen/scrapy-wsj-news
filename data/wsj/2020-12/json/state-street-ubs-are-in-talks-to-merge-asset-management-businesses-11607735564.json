    "body": "State Street Corp.  and  UBS Group AG  are in talks to merge their asset-management businesses, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The firms have held discussions since early 2020, and by this summer appeared close to an agreement, the people said. It is unclear why a deal didn’t materialize at that time, but the two sides remained in touch.<br />State Street had hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  to review the options for its investing business, called State Street Global Advisors, the people said.<br />As the firm weighed those options, State Street executives concluded the business needed to get bigger to remain competitive.<br />Buying a rival, however, wouldn’t be easy. Capital rules regarding large U.S. banks limit how much State Street could spend, as would its own stockholders’ initial reaction to its 2018 acquisition of Charles River Systems Inc. The bank’s shares had tumbled on the news of that deal. Pursuing a joint venture with another firm emerged as the preferred path forward, the executives believed, and State Street reached out to several potential partners, including UBS."
