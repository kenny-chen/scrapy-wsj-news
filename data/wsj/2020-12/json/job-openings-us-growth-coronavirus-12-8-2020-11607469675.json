    "body": "The number of job openings in the U.S. edged down slightly in the first week of December, a sign of a softening labor market amid an upsurge in coronavirus infections and ebbing fiscal support for households.<br />There were an average of 10.7 million job openings posted each day on online sites across the U.S. this month, down slightly from November’s 10.9 million, according to data from job-search site ZipRecruiter shared with The Wall Street Journal.<br />The figures are the latest signs that the economic recovery under way since spring is cooling. Job growth slowed markedly in November from the month before, the Labor Department reported Friday. Employers added 245,000 jobs last month, down from 610,000 in October, the Labor Department said.<br />One measure of hiring—the share of LinkedIn members who added a new employer to their profiles, indexed to the monthly average in 2015-2016—rose 0.8% in November, compared with October. The index jumped 18.1% from September to October.<br />“I’m worried about a temporary stall or backslide as we move into December and January,” said Guy Berger, LinkedIn’s principal economist. He cited a “triple whammy” of factors weighing on the labor market: fading fiscal support for households, spiraling coronavirus cases, and new restrictions on business and households to control the spread of infection."
