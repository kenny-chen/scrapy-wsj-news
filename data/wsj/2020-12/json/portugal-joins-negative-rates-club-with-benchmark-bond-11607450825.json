    "body": "Portugal’s benchmark bond traded with a negative yield, signaling investors’ increasingly relaxed attitudes toward a country that was once among the worst-hit by the European debt crisis.<br />The yield on the southern European country’s 10-year government bond on Tuesday fell to a low of minus 0.009%, according to  Tradeweb .<br />Portugal joins countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands whose debt also has subzero yields. It reflects that demand for the bonds is so high that investors who hold the bonds to maturity would get back less than they initially paid. It is also another sign of a turnaround in the market’s expectations for a more cohesive European Union.<br />A deep financial crisis in the early 2010s hit Portugal along with a number of other southern European countries, which resulted in government intervention in its banking sector. Divides emerged between northern and southern European nations, and concerns about the trade bloc fragmenting arose—resulting in significantly higher borrowing costs for countries seen as riskier and in dubious financial shape, including Portugal.<br />The coronavirus pandemic has had the opposite effect and is perceived to have brought Europe closer together, according to Rohan Khanna, a rates strategist at  UBS .  Policy makers have been actively supporting member states, both at the central bank and the European Commission, the trade bloc’s executive arm, which agreed on a €750 billion spending package, equivalent to $908 million, known as the recovery fund in July."
