    "body": "At the conclusion of a six-day trial over a mistaken $900 million payment by  Citigroup Inc.  to lenders of  Revlon Inc.,  a federal judge and lawyers on the case focused on what the recipients knew or suspected soon after they were paid.<br />The lawsuit filed by Citi against several hedge-fund managers to recover money from the erroneous August payment ended Wednesday with no decision from Judge Jesse Furman of the U.S. District Court in New York.<br />Emails and witness testimony from some lenders who decided to keep their share of the $900 million show they questioned whether it might have been a mistake.<br />“Can you point me to anything in evidence before 2:28 p.m. on Aug. 12 that anyone on the recipient’s side thought there was a mistake,” Judge Furman asked Citi’s lawyers, referring to the time and date Citi sent recall notices to lenders asking them to return the funds.<br />Christopher Houpt, a lawyer for Citi, pointed to an email from Allstate Investment Management Co. portfolio manager Catherine McCoy to colleagues in the firm’s operations department in which she wrote: “So strange—could this be a mistake?”"
