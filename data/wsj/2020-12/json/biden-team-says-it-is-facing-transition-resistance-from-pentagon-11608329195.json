    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team said it was informed Thursday that meetings with the Defense Department were being put on hold, adding it had met with “isolated resistance” in some parts of the government ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration.<br />Yohannes Abraham, the Biden-Harris transition’s executive director, said Friday that transition teams that are working with agencies to prepare for the January handoff had received cooperation from the Trump administration for the most part. But he said they had issues with some officials, “including from political appointees within the Department of Defense.”<br />Mr. Abraham said the transition was “concerned to learn this week about an abrupt halt in the already limited cooperation” at the Defense Department.<br />In a statement Friday morning, acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller said that a “mutually-agreed upon holiday pause” would take place.<br />Mr. Abraham said there was no agreement from the transition group to stop holding meetings. “We expect that decision to be reversed,” he said."
