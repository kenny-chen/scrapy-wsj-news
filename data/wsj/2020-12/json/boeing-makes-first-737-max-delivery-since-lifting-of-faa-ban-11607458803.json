    "body": "Boeing Co.  has delivered a 737 MAX to  United Airlines Holdings Inc.,  the first carrier to receive a newly produced model of the jet after U.S. regulators ended a nearly two-year grounding last month.<br />A United crew took possession of a MAX on Tuesday, according to a spokesman for the carrier. It was the first of eight finished MAX planes expected to be delivered to United by end of the year.<br />The United spokesman said the airline would inspect and test-fly each MAX before reintroducing the aircraft back into passenger service in the first quarter of next year. Pilots also would have to undergo new training approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.<br />The resumption of MAX deliveries is crucial to Boeing’s effort to stop bleeding cash by the end of next year or early 2022. The world-wide grounding since March 2019 has left Boeing unable to hand over finished MAX aircraft to customers who pay much of the sales price upon receipt.<br />The manufacturer had sought to resume deliveries late last year before regulators approved fixes to the aircraft’s flight-control system and related pilot training. The push ultimately faltered."
