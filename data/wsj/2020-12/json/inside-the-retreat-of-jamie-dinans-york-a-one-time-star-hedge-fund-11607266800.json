    "body": "York Capital Management’s hedge funds were flailing.<br />Its credit hedge fund, which lost $700 million on energy bets gone wrong, was down about 50% since 2018. Other York hedge funds were also in the red.<br />Longtime partners were leaving the firm and weren’t being replaced. Resentment simmered among some inside the firm that the head of York’s Asia hedge fund, a bright spot the last several years, wanted more money for his team and had threatened to leave, according to current and former employees.<br />The end came in a half-hour Zoom town hall late last month where 61-year-old York founder Jamie Dinan, nearing tears at times, broke the news to his roughly 180 employees that York was essentially getting out of the hedge-fund game, some of the employees said.<br />Like many hedge funds, York’s successes have been tough to find in recent years. Hundreds of funds have closed entirely. Others have cut their notoriously high fees."
