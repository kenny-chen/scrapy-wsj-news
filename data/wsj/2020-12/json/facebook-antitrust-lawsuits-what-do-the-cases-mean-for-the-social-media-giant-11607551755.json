    "body": "The Federal Trade Commission and a group of 48 attorneys general have filed antitrust lawsuits against  Facebook Inc.  The Wall Street Journal previously reported that a focus of antitrust probes were the company’s past acquisitions of potential competitors, such as photo-sharing service Instagram. Here’s a look at why Facebook’s past deal activity is under scrutiny:<br />What does the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit allege?<br />The FTC alleges Facebook, founded in 2004, maintained a monopoly in the U.S. by acquiring companies that presented competitive threats. “After identifying two significant competitive threats to its dominant position—Instagram and WhatsApp—Facebook moved to squelch those threats by buying the companies, reflecting Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s view, expressed in a 2008 email, that ‘it is better to buy than compete,’” the lawsuit said.<br />The agency also accused the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company of anticompetitive conduct in how third-party apps access information from Facebook. In the lawsuit the FTC said the company made certain application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-party apps only if they refrained from providing core functions similar to what Facebook offered.<br />What do the state attorneys general allege?"
