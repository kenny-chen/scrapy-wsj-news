    "body": "Blackstone Group Inc.  is amping up its bet on biotechnology lab space and other life-sciences real estate, agreeing to pay $3.45 billion for a portfolio of buildings primarily in the active Cambridge, Mass., market.<br />The acquisition is the latest sign of growing investor interest in life-sciences real estate during the pandemic. Blackstone was already one of the world’s leading investors in this type of property even before the Covid-19 outbreak.<br />Now the firm’s interest is intensifying. Earlier this fall, Blackstone recapitalized BioMed Realty, the largest private U.S. owner of life-sciences property, for $14.6 billion. The firm is also close to acquiring another two life-science buildings in the Boston-Cambridge market for $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />“The pandemic has only amplified the need for vital drug discovery and shined a light on the importance of innovation in life sciences,” said Nadeem Meghji, Blackstone’s head of real estate for the Americas.<br />Blackstone is one of the world’s largest real-estate investors with $341 billion of assets under management. Mr. Meghji said life science is one of the firm’s “high-conviction” bets—property types Blackstone believes are among the biggest beneficiaries of emerging macroeconomic trends."
