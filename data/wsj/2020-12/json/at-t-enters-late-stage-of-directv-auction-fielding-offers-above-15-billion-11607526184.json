    "body": "AT&T Inc.  received bids for its DirecTV unit valuing the satellite-TV service at more than $15 billion including debt, according to people familiar with the matter, as the widely watched auction winds toward a resolution.<br />Among those submitting bids above that level were  Churchill Capital Corp. IV ,  a blank-check company run by former banker Michael Klein, and private-equity firm TPG, the people said.  Apollo Global Management Inc.,  long seen by many as the front-runner to buy DirecTV, submitted a bid valuing the business at less than $15 billion, some of the people said.<br />The auction is in a late stage and should the company reach a deal with one of the suitors, it could be completed by early next year.<br />A deal could allow AT&T to deconsolidate DirecTV’s worsening financial results—a major aim of the transaction—while relinquishing control even as it maintains a majority stake in the business.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported in August that AT&T had tapped bankers to explore a deal to take the fast-shrinking business off its books. The media-and-telecom company bought DirecTV in 2015 for about $49 billion, or $66 billion including debt. (Its Latin American satellite business, also acquired through the DirecTV takeover, is now held in a separate unit called Vrio.)"
