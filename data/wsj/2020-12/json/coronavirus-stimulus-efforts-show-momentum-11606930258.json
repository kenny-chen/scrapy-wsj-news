    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democratic and Republican congressional leaders said Wednesday they saw potential for a compromise on a new round of coronavirus aid, as negotiations gained momentum after a monthslong standoff.<br />House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said in a joint statement Wednesday that a recently released $908 billion bipartisan framework should be the foundation for negotiations on a new coronavirus-relief bill.<br />The proposal “should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,” Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said. “Of course, we and others will offer improvements, but the need to act is immediate and we believe that with good-faith negotiations we could come to an agreement.”<br />Earlier, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said that Democratic leaders had “signaled a new willingness to engage in good faith.” On Monday night, Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer sent Mr. McConnell a new Covid-19 relief proposal, whose contents they have declined to disclose.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said Wednesday that he was hopeful that in the next few days, “we will be able to come to an agreement on a bill that responds to these major crises, at least in the short term,” referencing the need to help state and local municipalities and small businesses, among other things."
