    "body": "Barton Swain omits from his otherwise excellent op-ed examining “What Raphael Warnock Believes About Israel” (Dec. 17) one of the Senate candidate’s most telling comments on the subject. In a 2015 sermon he described the policy of Israel and its prime minister as “occupation today, occupation tomorrow, occupation forever,” invoking George Wallace’s famous line on segregation. This inappropriate comparison speaks volumes about his beliefs on Israel.<br />Kenneth A. Margolis<br />Chappaqua, N.Y."
