    "body": "Major League Baseball announced Wednesday that it was “correcting a longtime oversight in the game’s history” by elevating the Negro Leagues from 1920 through 1948 to major-league status, a move that recognizes the sport’s long-excluded Black pioneers and immediately rewrites baseball’s record books.<br />Roughly 3,400 Black and Latino players from seven distinct leagues, who were barred from joining the segregated National and American Leagues, will now be classified as “major-leaguers,” alongside white stars of the era. All statistics and records for those players will become part of MLB’s official history.<br />Before Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color barrier for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, the Negro Leagues were the highest level of professional baseball open to Black players. Those leagues produced players who are considered among the most talented ever to step onto a field, including Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige and Oscar Charleston.<br />“All of us who love baseball have long known that the Negro Leagues produced many of our game’s best players, innovations and triumphs against a backdrop of injustice,” MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said.<br />Bob Kendrick, the president the president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Mo., called the move “historical validation for those who had been shunned from the major leagues and had the foresight and courage to create their own league that helped change the game and our country, too.”"
