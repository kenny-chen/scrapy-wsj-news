    "body": "U.S. stock futures slid Tuesday as political gridlock on both sides of the Atlantic weighed on sentiment amid a continued uptick in coronavirus cases.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 edged down 0.5%, suggesting that the broad market gauge may pull back for a second day. Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.4%.<br />Investors have grown leery about the prospects for a quick economic recovery in recent days. That is because health authorities and local officials are calling for additional restrictions to halt the rise in Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations.<br />“We’re not out of the woods yet. There is potential for further lockdowns, particularly in the U.S.,” said Georgina Taylor, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco.<br />Some investors are also looking to lock-in profits as the end of the year approaches, she added."
