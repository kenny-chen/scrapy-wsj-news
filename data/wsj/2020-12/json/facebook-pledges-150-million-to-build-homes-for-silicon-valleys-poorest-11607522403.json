    "body": "Facebook Inc.  said $150 million of its previously announced planned investment of $1 billion in affordable housing will go toward homes for the lowest-income tier in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br />The Menlo Park, Calif., company said on Wednesday that this installment would be used to fund housing projects in five Bay Area counties that include units for residents making no more than 30% of the area’s median income.<br />These levels differ by metro area. In San Mateo County, where Facebook is based, 30% of the area median income is $52,200 for a family of four, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.<br />“This is extremely low-income housing, which is a particularly acute need during the Covid crisis and also an area which has suffered a lot from the underbuilding that we’ve had in California over the past several decades,” said David Wehner, Facebook’s chief financial officer.<br />This investment represents the latest details from Facebook, which in October last year said it was providing $1 billion to help ease a shortage of affordable housing in Silicon Valley. Facebook said it expects its fund to support the development of at least 2,000 units targeted at extremely low-income residents."
