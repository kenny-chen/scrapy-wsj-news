    "body": "WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate Rep. Marcia Fudge (D., Ohio) to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to people familiar with the plans.<br />If confirmed, the Ohio lawmaker will lead an agency that could play a role in helping Americans struggling with rent and mortgage payments during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Ms. Fudge, a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, had been promoted by fellow Black members of Congress, including Rep. James Clyburn (D., S.C.), a powerful Biden ally.<br />Her expected nomination was first reported by Politico. Mr. Biden met Tuesday afternoon with civil rights leaders from the NAACP and the National Urban League, who have urged the incoming administration to make good on pledges to create a diverse cabinet.<br />Ms. Fudge, speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, didn’t confirm she would be nominated. But she said: “It’s an honor and a privilege to be asked to be in a president’s cabinet. It is something that probably in my wildest dreams I never would’ve thought about.”"
