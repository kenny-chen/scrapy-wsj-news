    "body": "Swiss insurer  Zurich Insurance  Group AG will acquire  MetLife Inc.’s  U.S. property and casualty insurance business for $3.94 billion, the companies said Friday, the latest in a string of deals in the sector during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Zurich, through its subsidiary Farmers Group Inc., will contribute $2.43 billion to the deal, while Farmers Exchanges, its U.S. partner, will pay $1.51 billion.<br />The Wall Street Journal earlier reported plans for a tie-up, which would expand Zurich’s U.S. presence and give Farmers access to MetLife’s 7,700 agents.<br />Insurers globally have been reconsidering their operations amid the pandemic. They are also grappling with the impact of low interest rates on their investment portfolios. Some are recognizing the need for scale, while others are pruning units where they can’t make enough money to compete. Bankers say more deals are in the offing.<br />Last month a Canadian and Danish insurance consortium agreed to buy the U.K.’s  RSA Insurance Group  PLC for £7.2 billion, equivalent to $9.6 billion. Private-equity firm  KKR  & Co. in July said it would buy retirement and life-insurance company Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd. for more than $4.4 billion."
