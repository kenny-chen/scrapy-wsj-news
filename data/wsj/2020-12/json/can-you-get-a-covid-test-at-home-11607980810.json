    "body": "When an at-home Covid-19 test finally arrives at your doorstep, you may need to unlock the results on your smartphone.<br />As diagnostic companies move to bring Covid-19 tests into people’s homes, some developers are planning to pair the tests with digital tools and smartphone apps. The tools will be able to walk the user through the testing process or in some cases report results directly to health authorities, among other features.<br />“We have to make this so easy that you can’t help but do the right thing,” said Thomas Grys, co-director of microbiology at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona. He is working with health-care technology company Safe Health Systems, which has designed a digital platform to aid in at-home testing.<br />“Like a lot of processes, the least reliable part is the human,” Dr. Grys said.<br />Covid-19 tests that can provide faster, cheaper results are becoming more common in settings such as nursing homes, schools and doctor’s offices. Mailable test kits also allow people to collect their own samples at home and ship them off to be processed in labs. Yet Covid-19 tests that can be performed and processed entirely at home are still likely weeks or months away."
