Today’s best lithium-ion batteries have only a fraction of the energy density of hydrocarbons from oil and gas. Until that fundamental problem is fixed, there will always be a place for oil and gas.<br />Dale McIntyre<br />Bartlesville, Okla.<br /><br />The Solyndra debacle was widely reported but, except for the Journal, the Tonopah Solar Energy failure has mostly been ignored.
