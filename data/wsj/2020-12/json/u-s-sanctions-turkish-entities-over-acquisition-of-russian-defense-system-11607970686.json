    "body": "The U.S. exerted new pressure on Turkey on Monday over its installation of a Russian air-defense system, the latest sign of a growing rift between Ankara and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.<br />The Trump administration imposed sanctions against a Turkish defense agency and one of its executives under a 2017 law that penalizes the purchase of weapons from a blacklisted supplier, such as Russia.<br />The decision in Washington came after European Union nations last week agreed to impose sanctions over Turkeyâ€™s military moves in the region and its energy-exploration actions in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.<br />The back-to-back actions reflect growing concern among Western leaders that Turkish military collaboration with Russia will undermine the effectiveness of NATO at a time when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has become more deeply involved in several military conflicts.<br />U.S. lawmakers have long pressed Mr. Trump to impose sanctions against Ankara, but the administration had declined to do so until Monday, three days after Congress approved defense legislation that mandated the imposition of sanctions. Previously, Mr. Trump, who has formed a close relationship with Mr. Erdogan, announced the removal of Turkey from the F-35 stealth jet fighter program."
