    "body": "The English Premier League this week rescheduled matches due to coronavirus for the first time since March, turning what was already its most condensed season into a potential logistical nightmare.<br />First came the news that Manchester City had enough players and staff in isolation that it wouldn’t be able to play its match against Everton on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, Fulham requested that its game against Tottenham be rescheduled just hours before it was due to kick off due to “a number of players showing symptoms,” the league said.<br />This comes on top of the league reporting a new high of 18 positive cases from its most recent round of testing and at least one manager, Southampton’s Ralph Hasenhuttl, coaching his team from home this week. The timing of the surge couldn’t be worse: the holiday period is the densest part of the Premier League’s schedule and teams have been visibly exhausted.<br />“Match at 6 p.m…We still don’t know if we play,” Tottenham’s exasperated manager José Mourinho wrote on Instagram before his game was postponed. “Best league in the world.”<br />The entire Fulham squad was due to be retested in the hopes of making its next game against Burnley on Sunday. Manchester City, meanwhile, expected Sunday’s trip to Chelsea to go ahead after a new round of testing returned no further positives, the league said."
