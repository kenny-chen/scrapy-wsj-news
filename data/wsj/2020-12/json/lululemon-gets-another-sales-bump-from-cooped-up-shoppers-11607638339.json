    "body": "Lululemon Athletica Inc.  reported a big jump in sales and profits in the most recent quarter, as pandemic-weary shoppers snapped up its athletic apparel and other comfy gear, but it offered a less rosy prognosis for the year-end period as Covid-19 cases continue to surge.<br />Net revenue increased 22% to $1.1 billion for the three months to Nov. 1, compared with $916.14 million a year ago. Comparable sales—which typically include stores open at least a year and e-commerce—jumped 19%, driven by online sales.<br />Net income rose 12.3% to $143.6 million, compared with $126 million last year.<br />The retailer is emerging as one of the winners from the Covid-19 health crisis. Unlike some other mall-based chains,  Lululemon  was in a strong position heading into the pandemic, benefiting from the shift to healthier lifestyles and more casual dressing.<br />Those trends intensified during the spring lockdowns and throughout the summer and fall as most consumers remained home. In June, Lululemon bought at-home fitness company Mirror for $500 million, in an effort to capitalize on the pandemic-fueled shift to exercising at home."
