    "body": "IKEA’s decision to stop publishing its annual catalog marks the end of a tome that served as much as an aspirational lifestyle guide for millions as it did a marketing tool for the flat-pack furniture giant.<br />After 70 years, the catalog had become a relic in the digital age, the company said, calling the decision “emotional but rational.” The 2020 edition, which was sent out earlier this year, will be the last. The catalog will also no longer be published online.<br />Like an international version of the  Sears  catalog, which ceased publication in 1993, the IKEA book sold not only housewares, but a lifestyle. Each year’s version usually took on a theme connected to the home—2020’s was “sleep”—while promoting the company’s compact, Scandinavian aesthetic for everything from cheap futons to custom kitchen redesigns that can cost thousands of dollars.<br />“It was an opportunity to sit down and dream,” said Marthinus Strydom, who previously worked as creative director on IKEA’s ad campaigns. “A lot of people are sad to see it go. It occupied a cultural spot in brand marketing. It was special.”<br />As web shopping surged over the past two decades, IKEA said fewer and fewer people were using its catalog. A spokeswoman said that, in the course of testing new formats and ways to distribute the catalog, the company found it wasn’t worth the investment anymore."
