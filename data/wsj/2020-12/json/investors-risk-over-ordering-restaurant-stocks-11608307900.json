    "body": "A dark winter for the dining industry hasn’t scared off stockholders in restaurant chains. But a roaring spring is needed to validate that faith.<br />Darden Restaurants  said Friday that sales volumes have slowed significantly as the fall has progressed. Comparable sales fell about 22% from a year earlier at its Olive Garden locations for the week ending Nov. 8; the decline accelerated to about 33% for the week ending Dec. 13.<br />Tougher coronavirus restrictions help explain the falloff: 92% of company restaurants had at least some permitted dining room capacity for the entire week in early November and that figure has dipped to about 75%. For the fiscal third quarter, which ends in February, Darden expects a total revenue drop of 30 to 35% from a year earlier.<br />Wall Street didn’t flinch at the news, however: shares were flat in morning trading and aren’t far from record highs.  Brinker International  shares hardly budged after the Chili’s owner reported a similar decline in weekly sales on Wednesday and are up about 30% so far this year.<br />The apparent nonchalance has a strong rationale: Darden has a long record of growth and profitability, and expects to eke out a small profit even during a time of crisis. The company plans to grow its restaurant count in the fiscal year ending in May, and has reinstated its dividend. Markets are forward-looking by nature, and are well aware that vaccines are on the way and the pandemic may wind down in 2021."
