    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden’s pick of retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austinas his defense secretary has renewed debate about civil-military relations, putting congressional Democrats in the awkward position of defending a move they had criticized four years ago.<br />Many lawmakers have praised Gen. Austin’s military record. However, his selection surprised some Republicans and Democrats who questioned why Mr. Biden would pick a retired commander with long experience in the Middle East instead of a qualified civilian leader.<br />Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat and former Pentagon official, said Tuesday she respected Gen. Austin, who retired from the military in 2016. However, she added, “Choosing another recently retired general to serve in a role that is designed for a civilian just feels off.”<br />“General Austin has had an incredible career,” she added, “but I’ll need to understand what he and the Biden administration plan to do to address these concerns before I can vote for his waiver.”<br />Mr. Biden formally named Gen. Austin as his choice for the job on Tuesday and praised him as a “true and tested soldier and leader.” The president-elect also defended his choice, as criticism began building following news reports Monday of Gen. Austin’s impending selection."
