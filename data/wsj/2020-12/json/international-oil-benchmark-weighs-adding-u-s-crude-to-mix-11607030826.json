    "body": "Brent crude, the international gauge for oil prices, may be overhauled to reflect the growing importance of U.S. exports in global energy markets.<br />By March 2022, S&P Global Platts is likely to start using crude drilled from wells near Midland, Texas, in setting the price of Dated Brent, a gauge that has historically reflected physical oil prices in Europe’s North Sea. The price-reporting agency on Thursday began consulting market participants on the proposed change, and aims to conclude the review by February.<br />Set daily by Platts, Dated Brent is a pivotal cog in the global oil market. It bears parallels to the role of the Libor interest-rate benchmark in its heydays, or that of 10-year Treasury yields in global credit markets.<br />Since the late 1980s, Dated Brent has acted as the benchmark on which the majority of traded barrels of oil in the world are priced. It also helps to determine prices for the Brent-crude futures contracts that oil producers, commodity traders and investors buy and sell on  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s  marketplace.<br />For years, however, Dated Brent has faced a major problem. Brent, drilled from underneath the East Shetland Basin off the coast of Scotland, is fast running out. Platts responded by introducing different varieties of crude oil produced in the North Sea into its calculations. Dated Brent has evolved into a basket of crudes, including not just its namesake but Forties, Ekofisk, Troll and Oseberg. But supplies of other North Sea crudes are also depleting alongside those of Brent."
