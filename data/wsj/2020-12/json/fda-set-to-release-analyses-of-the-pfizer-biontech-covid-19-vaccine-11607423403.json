    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration concluded in a detailed analysis that the first Covid-19 vaccine being considered for U.S. distribution “met the prescribed success criteria” in a clinical study, suggesting the agency will soon green-light the historic product.<br />The agency Tuesday released two separate analyses, one from its own staff scientists and one from the vaccine’s manufacturers,  Pfizer Inc.  and German partner  BioNTech SE .<br />The FDA analysis highlighted various “known benefits” from the vaccine. These included “reduction in the risk of confirmed Covid-19 occurring at least seven days after Dose 2.” The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses for full protection.<br />In addition, the FDA said another benefit was reduction in the risk of confirmed Covid-19 after the first dose and before the second dose. Another clear benefit, the agency said, was “reduction in the risk of confirmed severe Covid-19 any time after dose 1.”<br />The reference to reduction in confirmed severe disease was important, as early critics of some of the vaccine trials were concerned that only mild to moderate disease was prevented."
