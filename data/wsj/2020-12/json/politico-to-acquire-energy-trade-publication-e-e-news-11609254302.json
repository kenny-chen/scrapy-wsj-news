    "body": "Politico is adding some energy to its game.<br />The nearly 14-year-old political news outlet is acquiring E&E News, a high-price subscription trade publication focused on the energy industry and environmental news, the companies said.<br />The terms of the transaction weren’t disclosed.<br />The deal will substantially expand Politico’s footprint in the energy news space and is part of a bigger move to grow its professional news business. E&E News has some 65 reporters in nine offices around the country, adding to Politico’s existing 17 editorial staffers focused on energy and environmental news.<br />“The story of our generation going forward is the environment and how the energy sector adapts to what needs to be done,” Robert Allbritton, Politico’s publisher and owner, said in an interview. “It is a massive story.”"
