    "body": "Bobby Jindal is correct in “Can GOP Find Its Way on Health Care?” (op-ed, Dec. 3). The goal of a Republican plan should be to provide any person who is sick or injured with the appropriate care in the appropriate setting at the appropriate time in the management of any illness or injury, with emphasis on preventing illness or injury whenever possible. This will take away the one central issue on which the Democrats have held the advantage, access to care.<br />Republicans favor a market solution to the vexing problem of health-care system reform but have been unable to articulate a simple, easily understandable vision to implement that solution.<br />The solution should be based on three principles:<br />1) Expand the choices. There are many different, imperfect ways to finance care and many different, imperfect ways to deliver care. Each has advantages and disadvantages. The Democrats argue for top-down central control of health care. Republicans recognize the potential of choice to create competition between imperfect mechanisms to drive down cost and drive up quality.<br />2) Give individuals the opportunity and the responsibility to choose and own their own plan with the periodic right to change if dissatisfied with the previous choice. Ownership of plan provides portability and eliminates the pre-existing condition dilemma."
