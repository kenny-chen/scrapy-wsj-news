    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House voted to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level, the first legislation of its kind to get a vote in the chamber, though it isn’t expected to move forward and become law.<br />The bill, which passed 228-164, would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, leaving it to states to determine its legality. The legislation would also expunge some criminal records and impose a 5% federal tax on cannabis products to help fund programs in communities hurt by the war on drugs.<br />The vote was largely along party lines. Libertarian Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan and five Republicans voted in favor of the bill, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) who was a cosponsor. Six Democrats voted against the bill, all centrist lawmakers.<br />The bill was a Democratic priority in the House, where lawmakers see it as a civil rights issue. It is not expected to move forward in the GOP-controlled Senate.<br />Democrats and civil-rights groups said the legislation was necessary to help end decades of arrests and incarcerations, particularly of minorities, over drug offenses."
