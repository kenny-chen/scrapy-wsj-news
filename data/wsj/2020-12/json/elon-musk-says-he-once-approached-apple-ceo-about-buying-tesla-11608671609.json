    "body": "Tesla Inc.’s  effort to bring out its Model 3 brought the electric car company near collapse in 2018. Now Chief Executive Elon Musk has divulged a new twist: He says he contacted his  Apple Inc.  counterpart, Tim Cook, to save his company.<br />“During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value),” Mr. Musk said in a tweet Tuesday. But the Apple CEO, he said, “refused to take the meeting.”<br />Mr. Musk revealed the latest detail as he questioned the seriousness of Apple’s plans to bring out an electric car of its own, amid a new report the company is pushing for 2024 production.<br />On Twitter, Mr. Musk called the report “strange, if true.”<br />Tesla has built a brand for itself as a Silicon Valley auto maker offering high-tech cars with promises of fully self-driving technology on the near horizon. The specter of a driverless, electric car made by tech giant Apple could prove the kind of fierce competition that traditional auto makers, such as General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG, have yet to muster."
