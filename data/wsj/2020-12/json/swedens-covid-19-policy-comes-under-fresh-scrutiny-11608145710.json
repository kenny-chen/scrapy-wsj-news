    "body": "A new surge of Covid-19 cases is increasing pressure on the Swedish government to further tighten restrictions, as an independent report criticized Stockholm’s policy of shunning lockdowns and Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said government advisers had underestimated the threat of this autumn’s rise.<br />More Covid-19 patients have filled intensive-care beds in much of the Scandinavian country in recent weeks.<br />With a daily average of over 6,000 new cases over the past week, hospitals in virtually all of the country are under strain, Ann Söderström, Sweden’s director of health and medical care, told reporters Tuesday. In Stockholm, hospitals have nearly twice as many Covid-19 patients as they do intensive-care beds, said Bjorn Eriksson, the city’s health and medical care director.<br />On Monday, the country’s statistics agency said Sweden recorded 8,088 deaths from all causes last month, the second-deadliest month for the country of 10 million in its modern history, eclipsed only by the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918.<br />The increase in deaths and hospitalizations has already forced Sweden to set aside a policy of using voluntary measures to contain the virus, a strategy that has drawn global interest. By contrast, most European countries have used lockdowns and mandatory restrictions to contain the virus this year."
