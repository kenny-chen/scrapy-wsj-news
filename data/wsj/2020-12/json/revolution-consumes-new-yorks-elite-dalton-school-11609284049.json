    "body": "The Dalton School, an elite private prep school in New York’s Upper East Side, is experiencing something of a moral panic, and not about whether or not to have spring sports during Covid-19. On Dec. 18 my blog, The Naked Dollar, revealed a list of race-based demands from 120 Dalton teachers. The Naked Dollar isn’t particularly well-known, but the story quickly went global.<br />The demands read like a manifesto to codify permanently the “oppressed” status of black students and teachers. Among them:<br />• Expand the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to at least 12 staffers. That works out to about one for every 100 students and would cost at least $1.5 million a year. What will they do all day? No doubt ferret out ever subtler racist infractions, real or imagined. The diversity industry needs friction to survive, so it perpetually reworks the definition of racism.<br />• Reroute 50% of contributions to Dalton to the New York public school system. An effective 50% tax rate on donations—the lifeblood of any private school—is a good way of ensuring that alumni close their wallets. How will the school pay all those diversity officers?<br />• Compensate “any Black student or student of color” who participate in antiracism initiatives or has his images used in school publications. Financial favoritism based solely on skin color seems an invitation to a civil-rights lawsuit."
