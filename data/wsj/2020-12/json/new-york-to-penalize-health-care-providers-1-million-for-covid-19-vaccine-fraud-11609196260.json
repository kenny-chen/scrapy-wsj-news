    "body": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday he will sign an executive order to penalize health-care providers that administer the Covid-19 vaccine without following state prioritization protocols.<br />The state requires that health-care workers at high risk of being exposed to the coronavirus, along with nursing home residents and staff, receive priority for the vaccine. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said that providers that ignore   this will face fines of up to $1 million and a revocation of all state licenses.<br />In addition, Mr. Cuomo said that the state attorney general’s office would now be handling a case involving ParCare Community Health Network, a health-care provider with offices in New York City and Orange County. State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said over the weekend that ParCare was being investigated by the state police for possibly obtaining the vaccine fraudulently and then transferring it to other parts of the state and administering it to the public without paying heed to the prioritization rules.<br />Ultimately, Mr. Cuomo said he wants “to send a clear signal” that the state won’t tolerate attempts to subvert the process it has put in place for vaccine distribution and administration.<br />“If you violate the law on these vaccinations, we will find out and you will be prosecuted,” he said."
