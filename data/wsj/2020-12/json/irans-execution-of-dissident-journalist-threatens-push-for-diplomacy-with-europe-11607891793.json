    "body": "Iran’s execution on Saturday of a dissident journalist has strained Tehran’s relationship with Europe at a time when the presidential transition in the U.S. has raised expectations of a diplomatic opening between Iran and the West.<br />The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday summoned the German and French ambassadors after the European Union condemned the execution of journalist Ruhollah Zam, who was sentenced to death for inciting antigovernment protests in 2017.<br />The foreign ministry criticized the European statements as an unacceptable interference in domestic Iranian affairs, according to the IRNA state news agency.<br />The rift is the second serious setback in less than two weeks to diplomacy between Iran and Europe ahead of an expected rethink of U.S. sanctions policy against Tehran by the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden.<br />In early December, hard-line Iranian lawmakers pushed through a law that orders the country to ramp up nuclear enrichment—in what would be its most serious breach of the 2015 nuclear deal—and limit access to United Nations nuclear inspectors if sanctions aren’t lifted by February."
