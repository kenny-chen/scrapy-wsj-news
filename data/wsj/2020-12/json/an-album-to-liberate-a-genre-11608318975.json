The 36 minutes and 23 seconds of continuous music resulting from this session were released in 1961 by Atlantic Records, without retakes or edits, as “Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation by the Ornette Coleman Double Quartet.” Even within a jazz world upended by game-changing innovations in 1959 from the likes of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Dave Brubeck and Coleman himself, this music was shocking."
