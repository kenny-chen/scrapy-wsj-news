    "body": "Tony Slonim was in the middle of a board meeting on Dec. 1 when his phone rang. It was Steve Sisolak, the governor of Nevada. He wanted to discuss something involving a tweet.<br />Dr. Slonim, the chief executive of Renown Health, a regional hospital network based in Reno, had no idea what the governor was referring to. But as a public-health executive overseeing 7,000 employees in the throes of a pandemic, he was fairly confident it could wait.<br />“No disrespect, Governor,” he recalls saying. “But I’m really busy.”<br /><br />Gov. Sisolak cut to the chase: President Trump had just retweeted a post that claimed that the Covid-19 treatment ward Dr. Slonim had spent $11 million to build in the parking garage of Renown’s flagship hospital was a “scam” and a “fake.”"
