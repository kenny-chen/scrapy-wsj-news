    "body": "The House and Senate are expected to vote this week on final passage of a $740.5 billion annual defense-policy bill, known as the NDAA. Lawmakers are expected to approve the legislation despite President Trump’s threat to veto it over provisions related to the renaming of bases honoring Confederate figures and his demand that it include ending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.<br />Here’s a look at what’s in the bill and what’s next.<br />The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes fiscal year 2021 funding for the Defense Department and Energy Department’s national-security programs, including a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops. It also includes items related to anti-money-laundering efforts, cybersecurity, overseas military commitments, Space Force and the U.S. border wall.<br />In July, a Senate version of the bill passed 86-14, and the House version passed 295-125, more than the two-thirds supermajority needed to override a potential veto. Now, lawmakers are planning to vote on a compromise version and send it to the president’s desk.<br />The president has threatened to veto the NDAA for two reasons."
