    "body": "U.S. government-bond yields fell Thursday as Wall Street winds downs in a shortened trading session.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury closed at 0.933%, down from 0.953% on Wednesday, according to Tradeweb. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 1.669%, compared with 1.697%, where it closed during the previous session.<br />The bond market closes at 2 p.m. ET Thursday and is shut Friday for the Christmas holiday.<br />Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, declined after the European Union struck a trade deal with the U.K., ending more than four years of uncertainty between the two major U.S. allies. But the price action was minimal and mirrored a similar drop earlier this week, when investors shrugged off new stimulus measures as Congress passed a $900 billion Covid-19 aid bill that includes direct payments to households, aid to businesses and more. The fate of that package is now unclear following criticism from President Trump.<br />Government-bond yields have largely been stuck in a range, pinned by the Federal Reserveâ€™s efforts to stimulate the economy and investor uncertainty around when a vaccine-fueled rebound will take place."
