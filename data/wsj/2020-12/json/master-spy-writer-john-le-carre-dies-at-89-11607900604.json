    "body": "LONDON—John le Carré, the spy-turned-novelist whose elegant and intricate narratives defined the Cold War espionage thriller and brought acclaim to a genre critics had once ignored, has died. He was 89.<br />Mr. le Carré’s literary agency, Curtis Brown, said Sunday that he died in Cornwall, southwest England, on Saturday after a short illness. The death wasn’t related to Covid-19.<br />In such classics as “The Spy Who Came In from the Cold,” “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” and “The Honourable Schoolboy,” Mr. Le Carré combined terse, but lyrical, prose with the kind of complexity expected in literary fiction. His books grappled with betrayal, moral compromise and the psychological toll of a secret life. In the quiet, watchful spymaster George Smiley, he created one of 20th-century fiction’s iconic characters—a decent man at the heart of a web of deceit.<br />For Mr. le Carré, the world of espionage was a “metaphor for the human condition.”<br />Born David Cornwell, Mr. le Carré worked for Britain’s intelligence service before turning his experience into fiction."
