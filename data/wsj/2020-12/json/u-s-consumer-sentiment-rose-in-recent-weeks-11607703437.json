    "body": "U.S. consumers grew more confident in the economy in late November and early December, with many expecting the economic conditions to improve when the country begins to exit from the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The University of Michigan said Friday its index of consumer sentiment climbed to 81.4 in the two weeks ended Dec. 9, from 76.9 in November. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a reading of 75.5.<br />Rosier expectations for the economy drove the index’s rebound, though respondents’ views on current economic conditions improved as well.<br />“Most of the early December gain was due to a more favorable long-term outlook for the economy, while year-ahead prospects for the economy as well as personal finances remained unchanged,” said Richard Curtin, the survey’s chief economist.<br />A partisan skew in views was responsible for much of the upward shift in sentiment, Mr. Curtin said, with Democrats becoming more optimistic about the economy and Republicans more pessimistic, following President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election."
