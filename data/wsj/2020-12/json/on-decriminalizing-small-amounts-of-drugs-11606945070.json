    "body": "It’s disingenuous of Seamus R. Fallon (“Oregon Drug Law Change Can Help Families,” Letters, Nov. 24) to insist that two grams of cocaine is one-third the amount a drug dealer would typically carry. What is the source for such a statement? Based on my experience as a high-school teacher, few of the drug users in their teen years are “drug dealers.” They are constant consumers, many on a daily basis, of stimulants of any kind. Two grams of cocaine is easily quartered for four classmates to afford a half-gram each, plenty to get amped up, behind some brewskis, especially for diminutive teen girls. None of the group is “a dealer” in the sense Mr. Fallon proffers his straw man; they are end-users for the dealers.<br />Oregon’s abandonment of its youth to the drug subculture, in looming years of turmoil and despair, will show in time that: “As the twig is bent, so is the tree is inclined.” Can Oregon not see the forest for the trees?<br />J.
