    "body": "The New York Police Department mishandled its response to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place in New York City after the May 25 killing of George Floyd, deploying officers with insufficient protest training and relying on crowd-control tactics that at times heightened tensions, a city watchdog agency said in a report Friday.<br />The city’s Department of Investigation said that the NYPD’s response eroded public trust and that the police department should overhaul its strategies for protests.<br />“While NYPD leadership may believe in good faith that they can effectively monitor themselves, we urge them to accept that in this moment their own efforts are not enough to restore and preserve trust with the public, and to seek a true partnership with robust civilian oversight,” said the report.<br />NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said he reviewed the report. “In general terms the report captured the difficult period that took place in May/June of 2020 and presents 20 logical and thoughtful recommendations that I intend to incorporate into our future policy and training,” he said.<br />The NYPD has begun a number of changes informed by the protests and in July began training its 35,000 uniformed officers on responding to demonstrations and unrest."
