Doses are scheduled to arrive at some hospitals and health departments across the country early Monday, and could start being administered within hours.<br />Some 145 U.S. hospitals and other sites will receive vaccine doses Monday, followed by 425 on Tuesday and 66 on Wednesday, according to Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, the federal initiative to deliver Covid-19 vaccines.<br />Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday he expects people to start getting vaccinated in the state Monday morning. Hospitals in other states are also set to begin vaccinations, though it may take some facilities longer to disperse vials and train staff.<br />Only a small percentage of the population will get access to the shots initially, as early supplies are limited."
