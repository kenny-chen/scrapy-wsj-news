    "body": "The New Jersey legislature passed a bill setting up the regulatory framework for a recreational marijuana marketplace, one month after voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing the drug.<br />The Democratic-controlled state Assembly passed the bill Thursday at 49 to 24 with six abstentions. The state Senate, also controlled by Democrats, passed it 23 to 17.<br />The legislation gives the stateâ€™s newly established Cannabis Regulatory Commission the responsibility of awarding licenses to cultivators and retail shops. Licensed retailers also will be allowed to set up indoor or outdoor facilities where customers can smoke cannabis.<br />During the first 24 months of the program, no more than 37 licenses can be awarded to recreational cultivators, according to the bill. Cities and towns will be able to prohibit any type of marijuana business within its borders, except for delivery services.<br />Gov. Phil Murphy, a longtime proponent of legalization, is expected to sign the bill. He has said he expects it will take a year before retail sales will be up and running."
