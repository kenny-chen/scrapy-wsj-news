    "body": "Natural-gas prices are heading for their second consecutive big monthly drop, stung by warmer-than-expected weather forecasts that are denting demand for the heating fuel.<br />Even though it posted an outsize rebound on Tuesday, the front-month natural-gas futures contract has fallen 14.4% this month. That would mark its second straight monthly decline bigger than 14% and largest monthly drop since January. Prices are more than 25% below a peak hit in late October and have suffered four daily drops of at least 6% this month, a period of outsize volatility punctuated by Monday’s 8.5% slide and Tuesday’s recovery.<br />Natural-gas prices often gyrate in the winter because demand in the season is driven by how frequently people use their heaters. The power-generation fuel is used as the primary source of heat for roughly half of the homes in the U.S., so speculative investors often position for demand and prices to rally in the colder months of the year.<br />Recent weather forecasts show warmer temperatures spreading across the U.S. in the next few weeks, though, driving an unwind of bullish bets and fresh price declines.<br />“It is becoming increasingly apparent that the market will need to gradually discount another warmer-than-normal winter,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note."
