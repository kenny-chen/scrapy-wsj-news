    "body": "Your editorial “Breaking Up Facebook” (Dec. 11) brings to mind the Radio Corporation of America. In the late 1950s Congress decided to go after the RCA, a global company that was dominant in the consumer electronics business. As part of a 1958 consent decree, suddenly anybody could license RCA patents at no cost. No domestic company of any consequence took up the offer, but the Japanese did, and that was the end of much of the U.S. consumer electronics industry.<br />Now the next generation of economic illiterates in Congress are going after  Facebook ,  another company that supplies what the public wants. Natural competitive forces will be more efficient in dealing with Facebook than a collection of lawyers looking for a big payday. There is plenty of seed money available for anybody who comes up with an idea for a better product than what Facebook offers. I suspect the real motivation behind the Facebook action is the firm’s editorial policies.<br />Gary Sandstedt<br />St. Louis<br />"
