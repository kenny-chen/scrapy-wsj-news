    "body": "Coca-Cola Co.  said it is cutting 2,200 jobs globally, including 1,200 in the U.S., as the coronavirus pandemic accelerates the soda giant’s restructuring efforts.<br />The Atlanta company, which had about 86,000 employees at the start of the year, has been trimming expenses and products amid the closures of restaurants, bars, movie theaters and sports stadiums that sell its drinks around the world.<br />The reductions amount to roughly 12% of the company’s U.S. workforce. Coke will make the job cuts through a combination of buyouts and layoffs, a spokesman said. In August, it offered voluntary-separation packages to about 4,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada. The company didn’t say how many people participated.<br />Coke’s North America business unit will be reorganized to look more like other units around the world. Until now in North America, the company’s fountain-machine business, bottle-and-can business and Minute Maid operations each had their own teams for marketing, communicating with retailers and coordinating with bottlers. Those teams will be consolidated, the company said.<br />Coke expects the job cuts to result in annual savings of between $350 million and $550 million, the spokesman said. The latest cuts include about 500 jobs in the Atlanta metro area, where the company is based."
