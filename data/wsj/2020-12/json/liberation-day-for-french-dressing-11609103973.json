    "body": "Unknown to most Americans, the Food and Drug Administration has for decades regulated the ingredients, composition, flavor and appearance of many foods. In a small victory for consumer choice and food innovation, the FDA this month proposed liberating French dressing and frozen cherry pie.<br />The 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the FDA to regulate the “standards of identity” of hundreds of food products to ensure uniform labelling. Ever wonder why some foods taste and look the same regardless of the brand? Credit the FDA.<br />The FDA requires ketchup to have a pH of 4.2±0.2 and lemon juice “may be used in quantities no greater than necessary to adjust the pH.” The consistency must also be such “that its flow is not more than 14 centimeters in 30 seconds at 20 °C.” Manufacturers have more leeway with hummus, aioli and pickle relish.<br />The FDA standards of identity have grown to occupy thousands of pages in the Federal Register and now serve mainly to fatten trial lawyers who can sue manufacturers if their labels don’t conform to government specifications. This is why some low-fat ice creams are labeled frozen dairy desserts.<br />Since 1950 the FDA has required that French salad dressing be made of oil, “acidifying ingredients” such as vinegar or lemon juice with vegetable oil constituting 35% by weight, though it need not include tomato paste. The FDA is especially vigilant on the threat from frozen cherry pie."
