    "body": "TOKYO—Japan said it planned to stop the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by the mid-2030s, bucking criticism by  Toyota Motor Corp.’s  chief that a hasty shift to electric vehicles could cripple the car industry.<br />The plan released Friday followed similar moves by the state of California and major European nations, but it has faced resistance from car executives in a country that still makes millions of cars annually running solely on gasoline engines.<br />Japan would still permit the sale of hybrid gas-electric cars after 2035 under the plan. Many models from Japan’s top car makers—Toyota,  Honda Motor Co.  and  Nissan Motor Co. —come in both traditional and hybrid versions.<br />Earlier this month, Toyota President Akio Toyoda said that if Japan was too hasty in banning gasoline-powered cars and moving to electric vehicles, “the current business model of the car industry is going to collapse.” He was speaking on behalf of Japanese car makers in his role as head of a local industry association.<br />Mr. Toyoda said the electricity grid couldn’t handle extra summer demand and observed that most of Japan’s electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels."
