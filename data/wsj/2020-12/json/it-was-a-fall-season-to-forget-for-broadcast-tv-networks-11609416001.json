    "body": "The broadcast networks will be happy to put 2020 in their rear view mirror.<br />Unlike streaming platforms, which got a tremendous boost from the nationwide shutdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the broadcast networks endured steep drops in prime-time viewing this year.<br />The drops in Nielsen ratings go far beyond the typical erosion of the past decade that is a result of viewer fragmentation due to the dramatic increase in content options coming from streaming services.<br />The declines in prime-time viewers range from 32% for  ViacomCBS Inc.’s  CBS, 28% for  Fox Corp.’s  Fox, 25% for Comcast Corp.’s NBC and 7% for  Walt Disney Co. ’s ABC compared with the fall of 2019. Fox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent  News Corp  share common ownership.<br />The drops can be attributed in large part to the effects of the virus on their businesses. Production shutdowns in the spring and summer left broadcast networks scrambling to fill their schedules with fresh content in the fall, making them less able to capitalize from an increase in overall television viewing from people being stuck at home."
