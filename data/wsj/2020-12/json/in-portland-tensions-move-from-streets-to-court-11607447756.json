    "body": "The tensions that erupted in protests and violence for more than three months on the streets of Portland this summer are now moving into a quieter venue: the courts.<br />Federal prosecutors in the Oregon city have charged more than 90 people with crimes stemming from the skirmishes between law-enforcement officers wielding tear gas and demonstrators throwing fireworks, frozen water bottles and other objects outside the federal courthouse downtown and elsewhere.<br />The protests erupted following the May killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody and led to strained relations between the federal government, which dispatched agents to quell the violence, and local officials who saw the intervention as inflaming the unrest.<br />The federal cases filed to date represent a fraction of at least 1,000 arrests made in Portland since May, but District Attorney Mike Schmidt said after taking office in August he wouldnâ€™t prosecute most of those arrests, citing limited resources. His office declined to pursue more than 700 cases.<br />Top Justice Department officials in Washington, meanwhile, urged federal prosecutors to be aggressive in bringing a full slate of federal charges, even suggesting they consider sedition, or plotting to overthrow the U.S. government, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. A review of protest-related cases show no such charges have been filed."
