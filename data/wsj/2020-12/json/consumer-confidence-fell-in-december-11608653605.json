    "body": "U.S. consumers’ outlook on the economy darkened this month as coronavirus cases climbed nationwide and local governments imposed new restrictions, according to survey data released Tuesday.<br />The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence dropped to 88.6 in the first two weeks of December, from a revised 92.9 in November.<br />“Consumers’ assessment of current conditions deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of Covid-19 remains a drag on confidence,” said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. In particular, respondents grew more pessimistic about the labor market, with the share of consumers saying jobs are “plentiful” falling to 21.8% this month from 26.3% in November.<br />“Overall, it appears that growth has weakened further in [the fourth quarter], and consumers do not foresee the economy gaining any significant momentum in early 2021,” said Ms. Franco.<br />Tuesday’s report comes amid signs that the U.S. economic recovery is losing steam. Initial claims for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, increased in the first two weeks of December. The 885,000 new claims filed in the week ending Dec. 12 was the highest level for weekly claims since September. Private-sector data indicated the number of job openings slipped in early December."
