    "body": "SYDNEY—A year ago, a studio apartment in central Sydney was in such hot demand from foreign students and expat workers that landlords could often find a tenant within days.<br />Adam van Rooijen’s inner-city apartment in Potts Point was recently vacant for six weeks.<br />“No one is really moving anywhere,” said Mr. van Rooijen, 37, who bought the investment property in April, just after Australia shut its border to international arrivals, closed swaths of commerce and restricted people’s movement in response to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Median rents in Potts Point, near Sydney’s harborside, are down 24% since March. Mr. van Rooijen tried engaging a real-estate agent and listing the property on Facebook Inc.’s Marketplace platform, alongside secondhand lawn mowers and coffee tables. He eventually accepted a 17% cut in rent to fill the property.<br />Apartments are turning out to be the big losers in a pandemic-fueled reordering of the global property market. Record-low mortgage rates, work-from-home arrangements and a desire for more space have driven demand for houses at the expense of apartments. According to  Redfin Corp. , an online real-estate platform, the average price discount for condos in the U.S. has widened to a record 17.3% this year."
