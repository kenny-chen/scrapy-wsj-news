    "body": "Chinese regulators said Thursday they have launched an antitrust investigation into Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  and separately said they would summon affiliate Ant Group for discussions on competition and consumer rights.<br />Taken together, the two actions mark the strongest enforcement action by Beijing against the country’s biggest technology giant and Jack Ma, its  billionaire founder.<br />The Alibaba investigation was revealed Thursday by China’s antimonopoly regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation, which said in a brief statement that it was acting on reports that Alibaba was pressuring merchants who sell goods on its platforms to commit to not selling on its competitors. Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, compete with domestic rivals  JD.com Inc.  and  Pinduoduo Inc.<br />Alibaba didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Ma couldn't immediately be reached for comment. JD.com and Pinduoduo didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.<br />China’s central bank and three other regulators, meantime, said in a separate joint statement that they would summon Ant for talks. Ant acknowledged in a statement that it had received a meeting notice from the regulators, adding that it would “seriously study and strictly comply with all regulatory requirements.”"
