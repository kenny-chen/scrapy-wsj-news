    "body": "If you’re spending New Year’s Eve at home in front of your screen, you can say goodbye to 2020, say hello to 2021 or try to forget what year it is entirely. No matter which camp you’re in, there are plenty of streaming options. Here, we have TV specials celebrating the end of the year, recommendations that can take you far away and, of course, a few ways to watch the ball drop.<br />There’s no shortage of stars lining up to bid farewell (or worse) to 2020. In Facebook Watch’s “Peace Out 2020” special, an array of boldfaced names—Arnold Schwarzenegger, Anne Hathaway and more—turn out for a send-off.<br />Netflix’s “Death to 2020” is a mockumentary-style look back at the year that—you may be surprised to remember—goes back all the way to a presidential impeachment trial, “Parasite” winning the best-picture Oscar, and Joe Biden’s battle with Bernie Sanders.<br />On Amazon Prime Video, actors and comedians show up for a comedy special “Yearly Departed’’ to chat about all that was lost (for better and worse) in 2020. Tiffany Haddish mourns the loss of casual sex, Natasha Rothwell sends up TV cops, Rachel Brosnahan bids farewell to pants, and Patti Harrison says a few words about the downfall of “rich girl Instagram influencers.”<br />“This is a shocking loss,” she says, “for their family, fans, followers and their branded partnerships with Smartwater.”"
