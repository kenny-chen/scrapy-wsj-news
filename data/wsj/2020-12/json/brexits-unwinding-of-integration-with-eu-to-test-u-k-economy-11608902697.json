    "body": "LONDON—The free-trade agreement that the U.K. struck with the European Union on Christmas Eve will heap new challenges onto a British economy that has performed worse than its peers through 2020.<br />While avoiding a trade disruption of the magnitude that would have followed if efforts to reach a deal had failed, the new agreement is the first in history that will throw more obstacles in the way of importers and exporters. That is happening as the U.K. copes with a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus that has forced lockdowns over most of the country.<br />On Christmas Day, ambassadors from the 27 EU countries met in Brussels to begin scrutinizing the agreement, ahead of its expected approval by governments next week. The British Parliament is set to meet on Dec. 30 to ratify the accord.<br />It will take effect with the U.K. and economies across the world already straining under the pandemic and governments’ efforts to contain it. The U.K. has been among the worst-hit economies, with gross domestic product at the end of the third quarter almost 10% less than it was a year earlier.<br />Britain will have to adjust to the new relationship with the EU as it simultaneously deals with the economic pain caused by the virus. That risks hindering a recovery, economists and business executives say, with unpredictable consequences for jobs and livelihoods as businesses adapt to the upheavals of both challenges."
