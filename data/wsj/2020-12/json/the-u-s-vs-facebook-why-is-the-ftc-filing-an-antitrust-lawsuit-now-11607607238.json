    "body": "WASHINGTON—When  Facebook Inc.  acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, U.S. antitrust enforcers reviewed the deals but made no attempt to block them.<br />So why is the government challenging those acquisitions now?<br />The question drives at the heart of lawsuits filed Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission and 48 states and territories.
