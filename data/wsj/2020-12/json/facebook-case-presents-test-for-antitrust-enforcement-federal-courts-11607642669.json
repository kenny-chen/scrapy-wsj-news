    "body": "The sweeping government antitrust lawsuits against  Facebook Inc.  laid down a new bipartisan marker for enforcement after years of hesitancy, but they will be tested by a federal court system that has proved skeptical of broad antitrust intervention.<br />The lawsuits, filed Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission and 46 states, allege the social-media giant illegally preserved a social-networking monopoly through a years-long campaign of freezing out potential rivals and buying nascent competitors such Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook vowed a vigorous court battle, saying its acquisitions made those apps better. It accused the government of attempting to rewrite history.<br />The cases come amid a national debate about whether a handful of tech companies have become too dominant—and whether antitrust enforcers should have done more to police powerful firms and concentrated industries. Criticism of the FTC and Justice Department, which share antitrust authority, has come from Democrats and Republicans alike.<br />The agencies, however, can’t impose their will by fiat, and must instead prove their cases in court. With the current calls for more enforcement, the DOJ and FTC have shown more willingness to test those waters. Weeks before the Facebook suit, the Justice Department and 11 states brought an antitrust case against Google. More states may join soon with additional claims against the search giant.<br />The last few years, however, also showed the pitfalls antitrust enforcers face with the courts, which have become more conservative and have weakened antitrust precedents in recent decades. In August, a federal appeals court ruled the FTC didn’t prove that  Qualcomm Inc.  unlawfully preserved a monopoly in cellphone chips. A New York federal judge in February rejected a bid by a group of state attorneys general to block  T-Mobile US Inc.’s  takeover of Sprint Corp."
