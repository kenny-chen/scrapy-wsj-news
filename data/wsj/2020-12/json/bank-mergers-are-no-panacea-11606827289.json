    "body": "Bankers love to think about mergers, but they aren’t a simple solution to the problems of Europe’s lenders, even within the same country.<br />UniCredit shares plunged Tuesday after Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier said he was stepping down over a disagreement about the strategic direction of Italy’s second-largest bank. A widely respected figure, Mr. Mustier had pushed back against board pressure to do deals, favoring capital returns to shareholders.<br />Last week, talks between Spanish lenders  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria  and  Banco de Sabadell collapsed due to disagreements over pricing, also highlighting the shaky case for deals.<br />Bank mergers have long been seen as a way for European lenders to boost profitability in the face of persistent ultralow interest rates, sluggish growth and fierce competition from larger U.S. rivals.<br />A patchwork of European and national regulations all but block cross-border mergers, but domestic tie-ups have been possible. This summer,  Intesa Sanpaolo  bought UBI Banca to create Italy’s largest bank. Plus,  CaixaBank  agreed in September to merge with Bankia to create Spain’s largest domestic lender."
