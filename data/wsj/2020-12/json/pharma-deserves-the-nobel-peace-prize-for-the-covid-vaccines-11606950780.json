    "body": "This is the moment to put into nomination the obvious recipient for 2021’s Nobel Peace Prize: the scientists at the pharmaceutical companies whose vaccines are about to rescue the world from the catastrophe of SARS-CoV-2.<br />Who else was going to save us from Covid-19? The answer, we’ve learned across nine long months, is no one.<br />When the virus threat became clear last March, the political authorities naturally turned for guidance to specialists in the discipline known as public health, and specifically to professional epidemiologists who had worked with previous viruses, such as AIDS or Ebola. In a fortnight, epidemiology was effectively given unprecedented authority over the daily lives of the world’s citizens.<br />In turn, these specialists took as guidance the global pandemic their profession understood—the Spanish flu outbreak from 1918 to 1920. Based on the evidence from this 100-year-old pandemic, their advice to the world’s political leadership was: Send your national populations home, and keep them there. And so they did.<br />Once they’d done that, once most of the world’s factories, schools, offices, business and churches had been emptied and once most of the world was staying home, political leadership turned to the representatives of science and asked, “Now what do we do?”"
