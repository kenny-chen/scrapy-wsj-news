    "body": "WASHINGTON—Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler has decided to retain current standards for soot pollution, keeping fine-particle pollution limits adopted in 2012 that set the bar at 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air.<br />EPA staff scientists in a draft report last year said key studies could support imposing tougher standards of between 8 and 10 micrograms per cubic meter. The report cited estimates that limits within that range could cut mortality risks by more than 20%, potentially saving more than 12,000 lives a year.<br />EPA officials said they decided to keep current standards after review by a scientific advisory committee and considering public comments. U.S. particulate matter levels are 20% lower than in France, Germany and Great Britain, five times below the global average and six times below levels in China, officials said.<br />“The EPA under the Trump Administration has continued America’s leadership in clear air, lowering our particulate matter levels to well below those of many of our global competitors,” Mr. Wheeler said in a statement. “Maintaining these important standards will ensure Americans can continue to breathe some of the cleanest air on the planet.”<br />The Sierra Club environmental group criticized the decision, saying soot poses the biggest threat to minority and low-income neighborhoods that are often located near industrial plants."
