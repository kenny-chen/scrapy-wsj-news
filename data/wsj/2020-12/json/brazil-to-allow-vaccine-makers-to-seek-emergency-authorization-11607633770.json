    "body": "SÃO PAULO—Brazil’s health authority Anvisa said Thursday it would allow producers of Covid-19 vaccines to request emergency authorization in the country, raising hopes that the hard-hit nation can begin its immunization rollout as early as this month.<br />Anvisa has come under intense pressure during recent weeks as state governments scramble to secure vaccines for their own cities, clashing with the federal government and President Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismissed the disease as nothing more than a “little flu.”<br />At least one state governor has filed a lawsuit at the Supreme Court for permission to bypass Anvisa and buy vaccines that have already been approved by regulators in other countries.<br />“Anvisa has found itself in dire straits,” said Carlos Fortaleza, an epidemiologist at São Paulo State University, adding that it normally takes two or three months to approve a vaccine in Brazil. Under the newly announced rules, it could take two or three days, he said.<br />Covid-19 has killed about 180,000 people in Brazil so far, second only to the U.S. The average daily death toll peaked at more than 1,000 people in July and had steadily been in decline, but a sharp rise over the past few weeks has raised concerns about a possible second surge in the country."
