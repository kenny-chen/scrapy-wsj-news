    "body": "The new Covid-19 relief plan for small businesses that President Trump signed this week doesnâ€™t address some weaknesses in the original stimulus legislation that allowed companies with checkered histories to get billions of dollars in payments.<br />The $900 billion pandemic-aid bill includes an additional $284 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program to support small businesses. In the earlier stimulus, 5.2 million small businesses borrowed $525 billion in forgivable loans.<br />Nearly 1,500 companies that received about $2 billion in PPP loans have faced allegations of violating government regulations or of criminal conduct, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of loan recipients and news sources.<br />Another 432 firms laid off workers after getting approved for nearly $1 billion in loans, according to an analysis of national layoff notices filed mostly by large companies by Good Jobs First, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit promoting corporate and government accountability.<br />The government has charged dozens of people in at least 36 complaints related to fraudulently obtaining coronavirus-relief funds, many for allegedly falsifying PPP loan applications and misappropriating the funds, according to a Journal review of Justice Department data."
