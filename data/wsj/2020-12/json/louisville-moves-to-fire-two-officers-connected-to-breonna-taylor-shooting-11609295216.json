    "body": "The Louisville, Ky., police department is moving to fire two detectives connected to the killing of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, during a nighttime raid in March.<br />Detective Joshua Jaynes, who wrote the search warrant, and Detective Myles Cosgrove, who fired his weapon at the scene, received pre-termination notices Tuesday evening, their lawyers said.<br />The killing spurred protests and brought heavy scrutiny on the Louisville Metro Police Department. Ms. Taylor was at home with her boyfriend when police raided her apartment. Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who later said he thought the officers were intruders, shot at them. Three officers, including Mr. Cosgrove, responded by firing more than 30 bullets. Ms. Taylor was shot and killed.<br />The department is accusing Mr. Jaynes of being dishonest in the search warrant application, said his lawyer Thomas Clay, who plans to fight the termination. “He did nothing wrong,” said Mr. Clay. “I scrutinized the search warrant affidavit.”<br />A lawyer for Mr. Cosgrove wouldn’t comment on the grounds for termination."
