    "body": "Nearly 900,000 workers applied for jobless benefits last week, extending recent increases in another sign the economy is entering a winter slowdown.<br />Unemployment claims rose to 885,000 from 862,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said Thursday.<br />More broadly, claims are down sharply from a peak of nearly 7 million in March, but the four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly volatility, recently increased after trending downward since the spring. The weekly figures can be volatile around the holidays due to seasonal-adjustment issues.<br />“The next few months will be pretty rough for the labor market as you do see businesses having to contend with this latest wave of Covid cases,” Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities, said. “You are seeing those government restrictions coming into play again.”<br />Ms. House, and many other economists, project the labor market will cool until vaccines are widely distributed. More than 90% of economists in a recent Wall Street Journal survey said they expect the rollout of coronavirus vaccines will cause hiring to accelerate in the second quarter of next year."
