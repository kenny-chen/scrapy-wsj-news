    "body": "President Trump’s nominee to join the Federal Communications Commission cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate on Tuesday, putting him on track to win confirmation and setting up a possible partisan deadlock at the telecommunications regulator when Democrats take power next year.<br />The Republican-led Senate voted 49-47 along party lines to move forward with limited debate on the nomination of Nathan Simington to a five-year term on the FCC. A final vote to approve his nomination is scheduled for later Tuesday.<br />Mr. Simington, a 41-year-old Republican lawyer currently serving in the Trump administration, appears likely to clash with Democrats over issues from “net neutrality” rules to the agency’s role in overseeing social-media content moderation under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.<br />FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, has said he is leaving the agency on Jan. 20, President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration day.<br />That could leave the bipartisan commission with two Democratic and two Republican members, including Mr. Simington. Mr. Biden can immediately designate one of the sitting Democratic commissioners as chair. But the agency’s new leader wouldn’t hold a 3-2 majority until Mr. Biden names, and the Senate approves, a fifth FCC member—a process that could stretch months if Republicans control the Senate."
