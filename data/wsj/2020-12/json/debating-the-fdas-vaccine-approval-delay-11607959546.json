    "body": "Your editorial “The FDA’s Political Inoculation” (Dec. 4) on the FDA review of  Pfizer -BioNTech’s SARS-CoV-2 vaccine application misses the mark. The FDA is the lead regulatory agency in the world. The stringency of FDA reviews set a high bar. To be sure, two decades in the biopharmaceutical industry has shown me that the process is often plagued with unreasonable requirements and inefficiencies. But the speed of the MHRA’s (U.K. drug regulatory agency) approval of the vaccine has been driven as much by European politics as it has by internal processes. Each regulatory agency has its own style influencing the approval process including timing. Less hostage to the EU’s European Medicines Agency bureaucracy, MRHA can be nimble and set its own priorities and timelines.<br />The standard review takes 10 months (six for a priority review). A one-month timeline from submission to approval is a lightning-fast review for an application that must be several thousands of pages. When assessing staffing and timelines, keep in mind that the FDA still carries the burden of other reviews of new medications beyond those related to Covid-19. The FDA review teams work diligently and now must be working 24/7. Give these highly skilled and committed professionals credit.<br />Coleman Gross, M.D.<br />Berkeley, Calif.<br />"
