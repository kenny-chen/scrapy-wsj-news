The company has raised other forms of capital in Israel in the past from both banks and equity partners.<br />“Kushner is considering the option of issuing bonds on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange,” a company spokesman said. “The company has had years of success working with Israeli institutions as both a borrower and a partner.”<br />Israel’s bond market has become a growing source of capital for U.S. real-estate companies, including Extell Development, Silverstein Properties Inc. and Starwood Capital Group."
