    "body": "NEW DELHI—The companies behind two of the most promising Covid-19 vaccine candidates,  AstraZeneca  PLC  and  Pfizer Inc.,  have asked India for emergency-use authorization to start using their vaccines in the South Asian nation, which has been one of the worst hit by the pandemic.<br />Both Pfizer and Serum Institute of India—which is manufacturing AstraZeneca’s vaccine for developing countries—have applied for the authorization, which would allow their vaccines to circumvent a long trial and application process, said an official at the Drugs Controller General of India.<br />“This will save countless lives, and I thank the Government of India and Sri @narendramodi ji for their invaluable support,” Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer and owner of SII, said in a tweet Monday.<br />If either gets authorization, it could be an important jump start for the global manufacturing process as India is one of the world’s biggest vaccine manufacturers. The emergency authorization would give its companies the ability and confidence to ramp up production.<br />Serum Institute already has more than 40 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine made and could have more than 100 million by the end of the year, said a company spokesman."
