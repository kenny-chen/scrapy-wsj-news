    "body": "ROME—Pope Francis will make the first papal visit to Iraq in March, to support the country’s Christian minority and urge peace and reconciliation in a nation racked by years of sectarian violence, including partial occupation by Islamic State militants.<br />It will be the pope’s first international trip since before the Covid-19 pandemic, and one that potentially poses health and security challenges for the pontiff, his entourage and the local population.<br />The Vatican said on Monday the pope would visit Baghdad, the cities of Erbil, Mosul and Qaraqosh, and “the plain of Ur, linked to the memory of Abraham.”<br />The trip, scheduled for March 5-8, would be Pope Francis’s first venture outside of Italy since November 2019, when he visited Japan. He has left Vatican City only rarely since the start of the pandemic.<br />The exact program of events will take into account the state of the global pandemic, the Vatican said. Vatican officials declined to say whether the pope plans to appear at public events that would draw crowds. Papal trips typically feature public Masses with congregations of thousands of people, even in countries without a Catholic majority."
