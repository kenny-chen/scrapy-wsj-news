    "body": "WASHINGTON—Dozens of Republican members of Congress lined up behind President Trump after he again threatened to veto a bipartisan $740.5 billion defense-policy bill, with a House vote later Tuesday set to provide a key test of his influence with GOP lawmakers.<br />“I hope House Republicans will vote against the very weak National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which I will VETO,” Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday. The bill, which secures pay rates for troops and other crucial military spending items, has passed on a bipartisan basis for 59 years in a row.<br />The president said Congress must jettison a provision in the annual bill that would create a commission to rename military installations, monuments and paraphernalia honoring Confederate commanders, as well as include language to terminate Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which grants social-media companies broad immunity for the content they publish from users on their site.<br />Mr. Trump also added two demands he hadn’t made earlier, saying the bill must “allow for 5G & troupe reductions in foreign lands!”<br />While Republicans and Democrats in Congress have indicated in recent days that they intend to pass the bill over Mr. Trump’s objections, the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the chamber’s most conservative lawmakers, said Tuesday they would oppose the NDAA and support Mr. Trump’s veto."
