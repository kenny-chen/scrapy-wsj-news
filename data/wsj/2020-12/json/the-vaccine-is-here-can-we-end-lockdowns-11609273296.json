    "body": "In Jay Bhattacharya and Sunetra Gupta’s “How to End Lockdowns Next Month” (op-ed, Dec. 18), hope triumphs over fact. In arguing for an end to lockdowns once vulnerable populations have been vaccinated, their analysis assumes that there is a binary outcome from Covid-19 infections: Either it kills you or it’s no threat at all.<br />Follow-up studies, however, have demonstrated that long-term cognitive and behavioral problems are common, affecting up to 20% of hospitalized survivors and up to 10% of patients with a much milder disease. There are a significant number of Covid patients who are left with chronic respiratory problems, chronic anosmia and cardiac sequela, and these problems aren’t limited to the elderly. The rest of the population is also at risk and must be protected, even if immediate death isn’t likely.<br />Most Americans would love to see the end of our public-health measures, but this is far too soon. What we can do is return children under 16 to school. We have sound data showing that, given appropriate precautionary measures, we can make school safe for students and their teachers.<br />Prof. Lawrence F.
