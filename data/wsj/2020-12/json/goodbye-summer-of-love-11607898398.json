    "body": "Jenny Durkan isn’t running for re-election in November 2021, and the world doesn’t mourn. Seattle’s mayor says in a video that she had to choose between spending “the next year campaigning to keep this job” or focusing “all my energy on doing the job.” More likely, Ms. Durkan realized that if she ran, she’d probably lose.<br />The mayor will go down in history for allowing protesters to create a police-free Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) in her city. She famously went on CNN to herald the event as a “summer of love.” Occupiers took over a police precinct inside the zone but Ms. Durkan did nothing. Violence followed—and now continues, with Seattle already having 55 murders this year, nearly double the number for 2019.<br />It says something about Seattle’s progressives that their answer to rising crime has been to cut the police budget by 18%, which the mayor signed last week. They wanted to cut it by 50%, which helped push the city’s first African-American police chief, Carmen Best, to resign. Mayor Durkan fought the activists and drove the cuts down to 18%, which in Seattle makes her a moderate. At one point the CHAZ protestors marched to the mayor’s home to show their dissatisfaction.<br />With her announcement, the political landscape has opened up. But the progressive reality of Seattle means that the next mayor will more than likely be to her left. Get ready for more love and anarchy."
