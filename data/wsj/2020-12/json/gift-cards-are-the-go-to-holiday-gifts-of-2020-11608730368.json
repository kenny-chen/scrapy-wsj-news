Gift cards are one of the hottest holiday presents.<br />Shoppers worried about visiting stores, as Covid-19 cases surge, and unwilling to risk gifts arriving late because of shipping delays are snapping up the prepaid debit cards, according to companies that measure gift-card sales.<br />Gift-card purchases in the first week of December were twice the rate in the same period last year, according to InMarket, a data-analytics company. Gift card sales jumped 48% last weekend, compared with earlier in the week, as deadlines for free shipping with guaranteed Christmas delivery expired, according to Rise.ai, which manages electronic gift card programs for more than 5,000 brands, including Allbirds and Milk Bar.<br />Tim Maynard has already spent nearly $300 on gift cards this year at retailers ranging from  Amazon.com Inc.  to  Target Corp.  to  Home Depot Inc.
