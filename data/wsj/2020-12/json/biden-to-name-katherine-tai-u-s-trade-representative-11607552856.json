    "body": "WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden plans to nominate Katherine Tai as U.S. Trade Representative, according to people familiar with the matter, turning to an experienced trade lawyer with expertise on China and proven diplomatic skills.<br />By selecting Ms. Tai, now chief trade counsel for the Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Biden would signal his intention to start working swiftly on pending trade issues while working with allies to confront growing economic competition from China.<br />Ms. Tai didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and Mr. Biden’s transition team declined to comment.<br />Her immediate tasks will include the implementation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and deciding what to do with contentious tariffs implemented during the Trump administration. She also will play a role in crafting the administration’s policy toward China, including when—or whether—to start lifting tariffs on $370 billion of Chinese imports imposed by the Trump administration.<br />Ms. Tai has spent much of her career working in the government, first as a lawyer for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative focusing on China, then as a Congressional staff member."
