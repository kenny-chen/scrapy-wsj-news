    "body": "Winning the Tour de France was just about the craziest thing the UAE cycling team could imagine doing in the middle of a global health crisis. Even as the squad rolled onto the Champs-Élysées with the leader’s yellow jersey last September, they could hardly believe they had pulled it off.<br />Soon that will rank only as the second most improbable feat UAE Team Emirates managed during this pandemic. Next month, the defending Tour champions will likely become the first team in major professional sports to be vaccinated against Covid-19.<br />At the invitation of Emirati authorities, the squad’s 100 or so cyclists and support staff will receive the Chinese Sinopharm shot when they touch down in Abu Dhabi for a training camp on Jan. 6, the team said. The vaccine became widely available in the country after completing its Phase III trial there earlier this month.<br />“We’re fortunate to be considered a relatively high priority team in terms of the UAE,” said Jeroen Swart, the team’s head of medicine.<br />How a multinational squad of noncitizen, nonresident athletes fell into the queue for a Chinese vaccine in the UAE is a uniquely modern story of globalized sports—and one that raises the possibility of “vaccine tourism” for those who can afford to travel to countries where inoculation is further along."
