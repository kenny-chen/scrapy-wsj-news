Should you be loading up on debt to pour into stocks, property and other things that might produce a return above the cost of repaying the loan? One notable investor shows how getting everything right can deliver fat returns—but still come with a hefty drawback.<br />Britain’s Wellcome Trust stands out in 2020, as it was probably the foundation best prepared for a pandemic. It was a co-founder of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in 2017, and is run by an epidemiologist who warned in January that Covid-19 was much worse than everyone thought.<br />The £29 billion, or $39 billion, medical charity—Britain’s biggest foundation—piled on protection for 20% of its stock exposure using derivatives when the market was complacent about the danger, and has strongly outperformed global equities as a result.<br />This isn’t just a story about getting 2020 right, although Wellcome’s longstanding portfolio of growth stocks, including China’s Alibaba, Tencent and  JD.com ,  also did very well. Instead, this is about Wellcome’s decision back in 2018 to borrow at what was then the lowest rate ever for a corporate 100-year bond, to invest in (mostly) stocks."
