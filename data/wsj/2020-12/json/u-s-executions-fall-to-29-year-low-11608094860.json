    "body": "The number of death sentences carried out in the pandemic-stricken U.S. fell to a 29-year low in 2020, despite a rise in executions of federal inmates.<br />The overall total of 17 executions for 2020 was the lowest since 1991 when 14 inmates were put to death, according to an annual report by the Death Penalty Information Center, a research organization critical of the death penalty. The number of new death sentences imposed this year—a total of 18 as of mid-December—is the fewest since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, the report said.<br />Ten executions were carried out under the federal death penalty, the first time that the U.S. government performed more civilian death sentences than the states did combined.<br />At least 11 executions were halted or delayed—through stays, reprieves or reschedulings—because of coronavirus-related precautions, according to the center.<br />Just last month, a federal district judge in Washington postponed the Dec. 8 execution of Lisa Montgomery through year’s end after her lawyers contracted Covid-19."
