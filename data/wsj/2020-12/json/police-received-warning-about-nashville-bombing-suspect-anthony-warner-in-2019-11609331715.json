    "body": "Nashville police and federal agents were told in 2019 that Anthony Warner was building bombs inside a trailer at his home but found little that allowed them to investigate the Tennessee man now suspected of setting off an explosive inside an RV in downtown Nashville on Christmas morning.<br />Investigators are still trying to determine what might have motivated the bombing outside an  AT&T  switching facility, which killed Mr. Warner, injured three others and damaged 41 buildings.<br />An Aug. 21, 2019, incident report and synopsis released Tuesday by the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department say the agency asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into Mr. Warner’s background after a woman who identified herself as Mr. Warner’s girlfriend warned police that her boyfriend “was building bombs in the RV trailer at his residence.”<br />Police were also told by Raymond Throckmorton III, an attorney who said he represented Mr. Warner and his girlfriend, that Mr. Warner “frequently talks about the military and making bombs,” according to the report.<br />Mr. Throckmorton didn’t return a call to his office for comment late Tuesday night."
