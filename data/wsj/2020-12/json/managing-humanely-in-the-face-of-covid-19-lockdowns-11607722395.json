Chief Executive David Farr looked hard at how prudently to manage, not just retreat from, the problem (“You Have to Take Jumps,” Exchange, Dec. 5).

Jenkins has been advocating since March. Accept what you must, but humanely and intelligently manage what you can.<br />James Connelly<br />Hingham, Mass.<br /><br />What a difference two days makes.
