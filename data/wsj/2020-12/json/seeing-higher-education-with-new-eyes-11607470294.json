    "body": "Editor’s note: This week’s Future View discusses how universities should change, given the experience of the pandemic. Next week we’ll ask, “Has higher education been dumbed down in the switch to remote learning? If so, how?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Dec. 15.

Rather than change drastically to support long-term distance learning, universities should focus on cultivating strong communities on campus.<br />For education to really take root, campus culture must extend ideas beyond the classroom.

No longer memorized and spit back out for a grade, the ideas become internalized through debate and reflection."
