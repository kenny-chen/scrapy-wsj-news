    "body": "SEOUL—North Korea, quiet on foreign relations for months, vilified a top Seoul official over her recent remarks about Pyongyang’s pandemic response and deployed an increasingly familiar mouthpiece, Kim Yo Jong, sister of the regime’s leader.<br />Ms. Kim, a close confidante of Kim Jong Un, took aim on Wednesday at South Korea’s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, who said at a security forum last week that Pyongyang’s oft-repeated claim of zero confirmed Covid-19 cases was “hard to believe.”<br />In apparent response to the comments, Ms. Kim said, “We will never forget her words and she might have to pay dearly for it.”<br />Pyongyang’s return to public rebukes, a hallmark of the Kim regime’s foreign-policy tactics, encapsulated much of North Korea’s behavior this year, when it has been consumed by domestic affairs and has directed much of its anger toward its southern neighbor.<br />South Korea’s foreign ministry didn’t comment on Ms. Kim’s statement."
