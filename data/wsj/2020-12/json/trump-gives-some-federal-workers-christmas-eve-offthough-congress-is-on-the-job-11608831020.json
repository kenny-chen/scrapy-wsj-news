    "body": "WASHINGTON—For the third year in a row, President Trump has given employees of the executive branch of the federal government a full day off on Christmas Eve, though Congress remained on the job Thursday morning.<br />When Christmas has fallen on a Friday, as it does this year, presidents have customarily given federal workers a half-day off on Dec. 24, as President Obama did in 2009 and 2015 and President Clinton did in 1998, according to Government Executive, a trade publication.<br />The federal government observes 11 permanent holidays established by law, including Christmas, but Christmas Eve isn’t among them.<br />About two million people, just over 1% of the U.S. workforce, are permanently employed by the federal government outside the military and the U.S. Postal Service, according to the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan public policy research organization. It wasn’t immediately known Thursday how many got the day off.<br />Some past presidents have given federal employees an extra day off when Dec. 25 falls on or near a weekend. President Bush excused federal employees from work on Christmas Eve in 2001 and 2007, when Christmas fell on a Tuesday, as it did in 2012, when Mr. Obama also called for a day off, Government Executive reported. In 2014, with Christmas on a Thursday, Mr. Obama granted workers a day off on Dec. 26."
