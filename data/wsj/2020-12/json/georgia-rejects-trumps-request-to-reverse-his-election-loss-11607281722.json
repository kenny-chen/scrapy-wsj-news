    "body": "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp won’t call a special session of the state’s legislature, rebuffing a request from President Trump, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan said Sunday.<br />Mr. Trump asked Mr. Kemp in a phone conversation Saturday to call a special session of the state legislature and to push lawmakers to appoint pro-Trump electors who would swing the Electoral College in his favor. Mr. Trump repeated the request at a rally Saturday night in Georgia, which Mr. Kemp didn’t attend.<br />The initial count and a recount in Georgia found that Democrat Joe Biden won the state by about 12,000 votes, and Georgia’s secretary of state is expected to certify on Monday that a second recount confirmed Mr. Biden’s victory. There is no evidence of widespread election fraud in Georgia or other states.<br />“The governor is not going to call us into a special session,” Mr. Duncan, a Republican, said on CNN. “We’re certainly not going to move the goal posts at this point in the election. We are going to continue to follow the letter of the law.”<br />A second Republican elected official, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, said on ABC, “I don’t believe that there’s the will in the general assembly for a special session.’’"
