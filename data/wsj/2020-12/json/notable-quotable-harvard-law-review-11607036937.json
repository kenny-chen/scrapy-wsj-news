    "body": "Harvard law professor Michael J. Klarman writing in the November 2020 Harvard Law Review:<br /><br />The second way to pursue a fairer Senate apportionment would be simply to ignore the constitutional provision mandating two senators for every state as a particularly egregious example of dead-hand control. The Senate could then be reapportioned through statute or perhaps a national referendum. Ignoring a clear constitutional provision would trouble many Americans, but the Court has done this itself more than once when societal consensus strongly backed the move, such as by . . . applying the First Amendment to the Executive and the judiciary even though its reach is plainly limited to “Congress.”"
