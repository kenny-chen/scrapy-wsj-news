    "body": "All year, economists, central banks and private forecasters have struggled to predict the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />They went from barely registering it, to predicting it would cause the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, to something much milder, on a par with the 2007-09 recession.<br />Forecasters’ inability to pin down how businesses and shoppers would respond to the Covid-19 outbreak echoes the black eye suffered by pollsters in this year’s presidential election.<br />Economists had no comparable events to predict either the path of the virus or the measures governments would take in response. Now, with infections and deaths are surging again and as governments reimpose or weigh reimposing restrictions, economists are again marking down forecasts—though not as drastically as earlier this year.<br />The pandemic was a “very, very uncertain situation” and forecasters’ swing to very pessimistic and back is “understandable behavior and good, because otherwise they’re not really calling it as they see it,” said Prakash Loungani, an economist at the International Monetary Fund who has written about economists’ tendency to miss the magnitude of recessions. “From my perspective, forecasters have actually done a good job this year relative to their past performance.”"
