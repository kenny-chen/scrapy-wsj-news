    "body": "Some  McDonald’s  Corp.  franchisees said they would raise prices on Happy Meals after the company revokes a longstanding rebate, escalating tensions between the fast-food giant and U.S. restaurant operators.<br />McDonald’s said that in January it will end a roughly $300-a-month subsidy it has paid each of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants for years to subsidize the cost of toys included in children’s Happy Meals. McDonald’s said it would use the money to fund other investments, including benefits for restaurant crew.<br />Some McDonald’s franchisees said they would raise prices on Happy Meals as a result. The children’s meals sell for an average of $3.76 nationally, McDonald’s said. Franchisees could raise prices 20 cents or more to offset the cost. McDonald’s executives said in a meeting with U.S. franchisees about the fees on Monday that owners are free to raise prices.<br />“The family business is absolutely a priority. We just believe the dollars are better invested elsewhere,” said Charlie Strong, chief field officer for McDonald’s U.S.A., during the call listened to by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Franchisees at hotels, restaurants and other consumer companies have fought with corporate offices recently over fees, promotions and supply costs. Added costs and operational changes during the pandemic have heightened those tensions."
