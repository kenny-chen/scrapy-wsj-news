    "body": "WASHINGTON—Lawmakers were weighing another stopgap spending measure to give themselves more time to wrap up negotiations on a coronavirus relief bill, as they raced to complete the details of the roughly $900 billion package.<br />With a government funding deadline approaching, top Republicans and Democrats are closing in on a package that would send direct payments likely worth $600 to many Americans, enhance unemployment benefits, provide aid to small businesses and fund distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine, among other measures.<br />Disagreements on authority for Federal Reserve lending programs, aid distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and eligibility for the direct checks held up negotiations Thursday.<br />Because they are planning to approve a relief bill alongside a broad government spending package, lawmakers had hoped to finish the former before current government funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. But as that deadline neared, negotiators said they might pass a short-term spending patch to tide the government over until the relief package is finalized.<br />“I continue to appreciate our productive discussions, but I hope we remember just how urgent this situation is for millions and millions of our fellow citizens,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Thursday. “We’re going to stay right here until we’re finished, even if that means working through the weekend, which is highly likely.”"
