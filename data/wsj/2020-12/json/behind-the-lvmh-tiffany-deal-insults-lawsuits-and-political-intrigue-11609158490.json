    "body": "Tiffany  & Co. shareholders are expected this week to approve a merger with  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE  that would give the French luxury giant a big cut of the high-end jewelry market and close months of drama that nearly killed the $15.8 billion agreement.<br />Wednesday’s vote is also expected to cap a deal in which LVMH’s controlling shareholder, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, didn’t get his way.<br />Mr. Arnault fought for months to renegotiate the merger after the Covid-19 pandemic threw the luxury industry into turmoil. He asked the French government for help getting out of it and later enlisted a  Rothschild  & Co. banker to conduct back-channel talks with Tiffany, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Arnault, upset over Tiffany’s insistence on paying full shareholder dividends before the deal closed, demanded the jeweler lower the deal price by 11%, the people said.<br />Tiffany declined and pressed ahead with a lawsuit, filed in a Delaware court, to enforce the initial merger agreement.<br />In the end, LVMH agreed to buy Tiffany at a 2.6% discount from the original deal price. Tiffany made a $70 million dividend payment last week."
