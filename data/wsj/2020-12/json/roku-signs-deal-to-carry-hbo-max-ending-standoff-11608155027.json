    "body": "Roku Inc.  reached a deal with  AT&T Inc.’s  WarnerMedia to carry the HBO Max streaming service on Wednesday, ending an eight month standoff between the companies and ensuring that Roku customers will be able to watch content such as the upcoming “Wonder Woman” movie.<br />The two companies were at loggerheads since HBO Max was launched in May over the financial terms for Roku to carry the app. The stakes were raised for both sides when WarnerMedia said the highly anticipated movie “Wonder Woman 1984” would be released simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max on Christmas Day.<br />The agreement significantly expands the potential audience for the WarnerMedia movie. Roku is the leading streaming app distributor in the U.S., with some 46 million active accounts and 38% of the market including set-top devices and software that powers smart TVs.<br />Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on the terms of the deal.<br />WarnerMedia has said its full slate of films for 2021 will be launched the same way as “Wonder Woman,” with availability on HBO Max in the U.S. alongside the theatrical release. The company hopes that such premium programming will generate a wave of subscriptions for the streaming service, which is battling  Netflix Inc.,   Walt Disney Co. ’s Disney+,  Comcast Corp.’s  Peacock, and several other services."
