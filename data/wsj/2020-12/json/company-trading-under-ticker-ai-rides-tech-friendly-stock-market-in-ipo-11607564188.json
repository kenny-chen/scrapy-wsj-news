The stock started trading at $100.<br />The company offers tools for developing, deploying and operating artificial intelligence applications as well as a set of pre-built AI software.<br />C3.ai, built by Silicon Valley enterprise software entrepreneur Tom Siebel, offered 15.5 million shares at $42 a share, above the estimated price of $36 to $38. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “AI.” The IPO raised $651 million for the company.<br />“This was a financing to enable the company to meet growing demand,” said Mr. Siebel, the company’s chairman and chief executive. “We have the funds sufficient to do our job. And our job is now to expand our distribution capacity, dramatically expand our number of customers, make sure every one of our customers and every one of our partners is successful.”<br />C3.ai is just the latest tech company to see shares take off on the initial day of trading. In September, data-warehousing company  Snowflake Inc.  shares closed at $253.93, more than double their IPO price of $120. And C3.ai wasn’t the only hot IPO on Wednesday.  DoorDash Inc.,  the market leader in U.S. food delivery, saw its shares jump 86% on the first day of trading."
