    "body": "The Trump administration announced sanctions Monday against two Iranian intelligence officers, accusing them of direct involvement in the “abduction, detention and probable death” of Robert Levinson, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who went missing in Iran in 2007.<br />The action by the Treasury Department was the first public move to formally hold Iran accountable for Mr. Levinson’s abduction, senior government officials told reporters. U.S. officials said that senior Iranian officials sanctioned the abduction and sought to cover up what had happened.<br />“The government of Iran pledged to provide assistance in bringing Bob Levinson home, but it has never followed through. The truth is that Iranian intelligence officers—with the approval of senior Iranian officials—were involved in Bob’s abduction and detention,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement.<br />He added: “While no one should be as cruelly treated as Bob was, this situation is personal because Bob served as a special agent for 22 years and will always be a part of the FBI family. We will never waver from our commitment to find out more about Bob’s long captivity, to give the Levinson family the answers they deserve, and to finally bring Bob home.”<br />The two officials designated—Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai—were described as high-ranking officers of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security."
