    "body": "The coronavirus pandemic will reshape health-care spending, even though its full impact on the sector isn’t yet known, the Department of Health and Human Services said in a report that found health-care spending increased at a relatively slow pace in 2019 due to greater hospital care and drug expenditures.<br />The report released Wednesday showed U.S. health-care spending in 2019 rose 4.6% to $3.8 trillion, in line with the relatively slow 4.7% increase the prior year and in keeping with a largely stable pace since 2016.<br />Federal officials warned that the findings don’t include any of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on health-care spending.<br />“Although the full impact of the pandemic on the health-care sector is not yet known, it is certain that it will have profound consequences on the provision and consumption of health care goods and services, as well as on the payers, programs, and sponsors that fund that care in 2020 and perhaps beyond,” according to the report compiled by actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.<br />The health-care spending rate during 2019 outpaced gross domestic product growth of 4%, while the share of the economy devoted to health care, as measured by the GDP, was relatively stable, increasing to 17.7%."
