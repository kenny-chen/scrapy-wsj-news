    "body": "Count daytime television as one of the pandemic’s winners. The audience for work-hours TV has shifted, however.<br />Ratings and research firm Nielsen reports that daytime has become “a second prime time” for what were once called “office professionals and managers.” In October, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday to Friday, these white-collar couch potatoes on average increased their viewing time by two hours and 10 minutes compared with a year earlier.<br />This is even more significant because it is a different audience than the typical daytime TV crowd, and one with much higher spending power. “That means content creators, networks and marketers should be actively thinking about making adjustments to ensure that their efforts are seen and heard when engagement is high,” Nielsen says.<br />A vaccine is coming, but not soon enough to rip these home-office warriors from the tube. “The established new routines of consumers, the colder winter months and increased movement restrictions will further solidify daytime TV as a true work companion,” Nielsen argues.<br />In short, while stuck at home this winter, expect more ads for luxury cars and fewer for reverse mortgages and catheters."
