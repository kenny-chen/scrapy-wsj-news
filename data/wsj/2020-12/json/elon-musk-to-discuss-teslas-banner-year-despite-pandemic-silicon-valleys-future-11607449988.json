    "body": "Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk said he has moved to Texas, taking aim at Silicon Valley and becoming one of the highest-profile executives yet to leave California during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />He said the move made sense with Tesla’s new factory under way in Texas, as he lamented that California had become complacent with its innovators.<br />Mr. Musk likened California to a sports team with a long winning streak, saying, “They do tend to get a little complacent, a little entitled, and then they don’t win the championship anymore.” California, he said, “has been winning for a long time. And I think they’re taking them for granted a little bit.”<br />Mr. Musk made the comments Tuesday during The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council annual summit in an interview with Editor in Chief Matt Murray.<br />Startup executives and employees have fled the San Francisco Bay Area for cheaper locales since the pandemic has led to remote working conditions. Last week,  Hewlett Packard Enterprise ,  whose origins trace back to the founding of Silicon Valley, said it planned to shift its headquarters to Texas. The exodus has led many tech leaders and industry watchers to question whether the geographic region is losing relevance as the nation’s leading tech hub."
