    "body": "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger recertified Georgia’s presidential-election results Monday after a second recount, his office said, confirming that President-elect Joe Biden won the state.<br />Mr. Biden’s margin of victory was about 12,000 votes based on the machine recount, according to the secretary of state’s website. State officials have said there was a modest change from the previously certified results, which followed a by-hand recount of votes and showed Mr. Biden ahead by 12,670.<br />“It’s been a long 34 days since the election on Nov. 3. We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged,” Mr. Raffensperger said Monday at the state Capitol.<br />President Trump has alleged widespread fraud and assailed Georgia officials who have rejected his efforts to overturn the Nov. 3 election results, including Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger, both Republicans.<br />Mr. Kemp is expected to recertify the results and the awarding of Georgia’s 16 electoral votes to Mr. Biden."
