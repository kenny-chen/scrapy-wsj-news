    "body": "Phil Gramm and Mike Solon’s “In Defense of Scrooge, Whose Thrift Blessed the World” (op-ed, Dec. 24) is a witty and intelligent defense of capitalism with a moral error. The genius of capitalism is that it harnesses human greed to the common good—but greed itself remains a sin. We are reminded of this every time a company uses foreign slave labor to bring down prices or calculates that the lawsuits arising from a safety glitch will cost it less than fixing the danger before anyone gets hurt. It may be good business, but it’s bad living.<br />Capitalism is a boon to humanity, but Marley was right: Mankind remains our business as well, and fairness, honesty and generosity should govern the heart even in the pursuit of profits.<br />It’s a fallen world. No system will fix it. Socialism errs in thinking it can force sinful humans to be what they are not. Capitalism errs in thinking that putting sin to good use will transform it into virtue. The only true solution to our fallen state, as Tiny Tim knew, is to “remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.”<br />Andrew Klavan<br />Los Angeles"
