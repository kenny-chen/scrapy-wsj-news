    "body": "The maker of “Cyberpunk 2077,” one of this year’s most anticipated videogames, told players they could seek refunds because the initial version included bugs, a rare move for a major publisher and the latest mark on a project beset by launch delays.<br />Warsaw-based  CD Projekt SA  said Monday in a tweet that the $60 game, which features Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves and came out last week, doesn’t function properly on  Sony Corp.’s  PlayStation 4 and  Microsoft Corp.’s  Xbox One. The company apologized and said it has addressed some issues with recent updates and is planning more in the weeks ahead.<br />“We would appreciate it if you would give us a chance, but if you are not pleased with the game on your console and don’t want to wait for updates, you can opt to refund your copy,” the company said.<br />Analysts had forecast that “Cyberpunk” would sell anywhere from 18 million to 25 million copies in its first month. The day it came out  CD Projekt  said the game had eight million preorders, of which about 59%, or 4.7 million copies, were for PCs.<br />A spokeswoman for  CD Projekt  declined to comment further. CD Projekt shares are down about 25% since Wednesday’s close in Warsaw trading, shedding more than $2 billion of market value."
