    "body": "PARIS—A French court convicted fourteen people Wednesday of helping carry out the 2015 terrorist attacks on satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery store, as France sought to close one of the more painful chapters in its modern history.<br />The three-day shooting spree that killed 17 people in January 2015 marked the beginning of a string of terrorist attacks that would leave hundreds dead in the years to come and reshape everyday life in France. All three of the gunmen who mounted the attack on Charlie Hebdo and the grocer died in standoffs with police at the time.<br />On Wednesday, judges in Paris handed down prison sentences to a network of people charged with assisting the men. Three people were convicted in absentia, including Hayat Boumeddiene, who married one of the gunmen in a religious ceremony before the attacks.<br />She received a sentence of 30 years in prison for belonging to a terrorist organization and financing terrorism. Ms. Boumeddiene, whom prosecutors described in court as an “Islamic State princess,” fled to Syria days before the attacks. She is on the run from an international arrest warrant.<br />Ali Riza Polat, a 35-year-old French-Turkish man, was sentenced to life in prison for aiding and abetting Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who attacked the grocery store."
