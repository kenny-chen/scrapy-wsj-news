    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for secretary of state is set to face intensive questioning from GOP senators concerned that a Biden administration will return to policies they opposed during the Obama administration.<br />Antony Blinken, a longtime Biden aide and former deputy secretary of state, is likely to have a confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January, during the waning days of the Trump administration, congressional staffers and analysts said.<br />Barring unexpected disclosures or political maneuvers, Mr. Blinken, a former staff chief for the Senate committee, is expected to be confirmed without difficulty, even as the partisan composition of the Senate depends on the outcome of two races in Georgia on Jan. 5.<br />Still, Republican senators on the committee are set to question Mr. Blinken on priorities they have helped advance during the Trump administration. Some Republicans on the panel who are likely to ask tough questions, including Sens. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R., Texas), have had presidential ambitions in recent years.<br />Foreign-policy experts say Mr. Blinken is unlikely to reveal many details of the early efforts to formulate the detailed policies of the new administration."
