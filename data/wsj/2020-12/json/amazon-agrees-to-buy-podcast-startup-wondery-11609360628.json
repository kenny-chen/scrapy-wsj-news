The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the talks valued Wondery at more than $300 million.<br />Founded in 2016, Wondery is one of several audio startups that blossomed in recent years as podcasting caught on with advertisers and listeners. Wondery is known for its gritty, narrative-driven podcasts that apply cinematic sound design to nonfiction stories.<br />Amazon said acquiring Wondery—the maker of true-crime shows like “Dr. Death,” “Dirty John” and “The Shrink Next Door”—would allow the company to deepen its podcast offerings.<br />Wondery podcasts will continue to be available to listeners on a variety of platforms for free when the deal closes, Amazon said. Wondery will be joining Amazon Music, the division of the company that offers listeners music-streaming and podcasts."
