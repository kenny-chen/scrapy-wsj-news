    "body": "New York is poised to enact wide-reaching protections for tenants suffering from hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic, with lawmakers expected to place a moratorium on many evictions until May 1.<br />New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said Monday he would sign the bill, a move cheered by tenant advocates who said the state would be enacting one of the strictest eviction moratoriums in the country. Opponents said the legislation didn’t do enough to protect landlords and could prevent struggling building owners from paying their taxes.<br />The bill effectively bans all evictions statewide for 60 days, including those already in motion. After that, tenants who are unable to pay their rent because of the coronavirus pandemic can file paperwork to prevent or suspend eviction proceedings until May 1. Households where a member is at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 are also protected under the bill.<br />“You do not solve a public health crisis, you do not solve an economic crisis, by kicking people out on the street,” said state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, a Democrat from Brooklyn. “You solve it by keeping people in their homes.”<br />The state Senate voted Monday afternoon to approve the legislation, and the Assembly continued its debate into the evening."
