    "body": "The Justice Department reached a civil settlement with the United Auto Workers union, marking a major turning point in a multiyear corruption investigation that has sent several former labor leaders to prison.<br />The sprawling probe, led by the U.S. attorney’s office in Detroit, has penetrated the UAW’s top ranks and exposed what federal prosecutors described as a culture of corruption among its leadership built around kickback schemes, embezzlement and other illicit activities. It has led to 15 convictions so far and some union members say the charges and indictments have dented trust in the UAW’s leadership.<br />The proposed settlement includes a six-year period of independent oversight by a court-appointed monitor and requires the UAW to pay $1.5 million to resolve outstanding tax issues, U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider said at a press conference on Monday.<br />The UAW has also agreed to hold a referendum among the rank-and-file to potentially change the way it elects top leadership, an effort aimed at giving members more influence over who runs the union.<br />The federal investigation, which first became public in 2017, is one of the largest into a national labor union in decades and has led to the convictions, including two former UAW presidents."
