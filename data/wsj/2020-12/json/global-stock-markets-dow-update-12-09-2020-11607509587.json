    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged higher Wednesday, suggesting that the major indexes may grind toward new all-time highs after the opening bell, as investors bet on fresh fiscal stimulus spending.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked up 0.1% a day after the benchmark notched its 30th record close for this year. Nasdaq-100 futures slid less than 0.1%, indicating that technology stocks may be subdued after the New York opening bell.<br />Investors are optimistic Congress will pass another coronavirus relief package to bolster the economic recovery as rising infections prompt restrictions on social and business activity. The Trump administration proposed a $916 billion package on Tuesday after Democrats rejected an effort by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to narrow the scope of the bill.<br />“It does look to me like we are inching toward a deal,” said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “The market reaction is highlighting what we’ve heard from central bankers: fiscal stimulus is the best way to support the economy and monetary policy can only do so much.”<br />Lawmakers appear to be facing pressure to offer aid to those who have been hardest hit by the pandemic as infection levels and hospitalizations rise across the country. The U.S. reported more than 215,000 new cases for Tuesday. Some states have introduced fresh restrictions, triggering concern that the economic recovery could falter in the winter months."
