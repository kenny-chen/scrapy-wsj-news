    "body": "The coronavirus-relief bill passed by Congress on Monday will likely spur a stronger economic recovery in the second half of 2021, though it may be arriving too late to stave off a further slowdown this winter, analysts say.<br />Economists nudged up their 2021 economic-growth forecasts to reflect the  roughly $900 billion aid package, which includes aid to households, unemployed workers and small businesses battered by the pandemic.<br />Capital Economics now sees U.S. gross domestic product expanding 5.5% next year, up from a previous forecast of 5% growth. Oxford Economics, another research firm, estimates the additional federal spending should add about 1 percentage point to next year’s GDP growth, which it forecasts at 4.5%.<br />“Where you will see the most upside is really when it comes to household spending,” said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.<br />The bill adds $300 to weekly unemployment payments for 11 weeks and extends two other unemployment programs—at a projected cost of $120 billion. It also includes direct checks of $600 to most individuals, at a cost of $166 billion."
