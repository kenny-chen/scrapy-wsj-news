    "body": "Israel and Morocco agreed to normalize relations, President Trump said Thursday, marking another advance in U.S. efforts to strengthen ties between once-hostile nations in the region.<br />The U.S.-brokered deal was the fourth in four months between Israel and Arab countries that have refused to recognize the Jewish-led nation since it was created in 1948.<br />Under the deal, Mr. Trump agreed to recognize Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara, a contested region controlled by the North African nation where militants have sought to create an independent state.<br />Mr. Trump hailed the deal on Twitter as an historic breakthrough.<br />“This will be a very warm peace,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday. He said Israel and Morocco would quickly set up liaison offices in each other’s countries and introduce direct flights."
