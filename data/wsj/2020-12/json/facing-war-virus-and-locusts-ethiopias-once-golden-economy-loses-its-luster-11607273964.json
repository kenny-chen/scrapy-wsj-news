    "sub_head": "Nation’s economy has expanded at an average of almost 10% in recent years, but growth has ground to a halt: ‘Fighting for our very existence’",

    "body": "For the past decade Ethiopia has boasted of one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, welcoming billions of dollars in foreign direct investment from the U.S. and China and lifting more than 20 million people out of poverty.<br />Now, a monthlong civil war, coronavirus lockdowns and historic locust infestations have left the once-golden economy stumbling, as it grapples with one of Africa’s most perilous debt loads, soaring inflation and the risk of a protracted insurgency.<br />Fighting between government forces and the rebel Tigray People’s Liberation Front has paralyzed much of northern Ethiopia, shaking a nation of 110 million people long seen as a symbol of stability in a volatile region.<br />Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has claimed victory after taking the rebel stronghold of Mekelle, but TPLF fighters have retreated into remote mountainous regions and vow to continue fighting.<br />Roads, bridges, a power plant and a sugar mill have been destroyed. The Ethiopian currency has sunk 20% against the dollar this year, suppressing purchasing power across a nation where millions of people are already dependent on food aid."
