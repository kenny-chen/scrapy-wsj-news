    "body": "Five current and former New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority workers have been charged with falsely claiming hundreds of hours of overtime pay.<br />Federal prosecutors said the five claimed almost physically impossible levels of overtime, often while they were at home or elsewhere, which contributed to each of them earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime in 2018.<br />Thomas Caputo, an MTA Long Island Rail Road track inspector, from Holbrook, N.Y., received overtime equivalent to working 10 additional hours a day, every day, for 365 days, prosecutors said in a statement accompanying the unsealing of criminal complaints on Thursday.<br />Mr. Caputo, who is 56 years old, was paid $344,000 in overtime in 2018, taking his salary to $461,000 and making him the highest-paid MTA employee that year. MTA Chairman Patrick Foyeâ€™s total compensation that year was $347,000.<br />The other four defendants, three of whom worked for the LIRR and one subway maintenance supervisor, were each paid more than $240,000 in overtime, prosecutors said. Each was charged with one count of federal program fraud Thursday. The charge carries a maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years."
