    "body": "WASHINGTON—Large crowds of Trump supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., on Saturday calling for the November presidential-election result to be overturned, two days before the Electoral College meets.<br />By evening, skirmishes broke out between some of the demonstrators and counterprotesters.<br />The pro-Trump demonstration near the White House brought together a variety of backers of President Trump during the day, including some members of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys. The gathering was a reprise of a similar rally after last month’s election, which also led to violence overnight.<br />The protests came after the Supreme Court rejected Texas’s long-shot bid to void 20 million votes in four other states. It was Mr. Trump’s last chance to overturn the election results before the Electoral College convenes Monday to formally cast the votes that determine the president. Joe Biden has earned 306 votes to Mr. Trump’s 232.<br />Attorney General William Barr has said the Justice Department hasn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud. A federal court in Wisconsin also dealt another blow to the president on Saturday, dismissing one of his few remaining lawsuits, which had argued the state’s election results should be thrown out."
