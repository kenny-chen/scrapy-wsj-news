    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Identity Health-Care Pick” (Dec. 8): The selection of Xavier Becerra to run the Department of Health and Human Services shows that Joe Biden’s team knows what it wants to do. The requirement for the Biden administration HHS role isn’t health-care experience—it is litigation experience centered on expanding public health care and prosecuting those businesses and organizations that impede it.<br />Make no mistake, as a Californian, I’ve witnessed Mr. Becerra systematically expand the scope of “public health” to include gun control (via mental health), strict automotive emissions standards and even fracking (pollution affects health). Mr. Becerra will ensure that all of these are put into play as part of a “build back better” government-run health-care agenda.<br />The experiment in California has led to higher taxes, fewer health-insurance options and more expensive products and services. Perhaps the real slogan should be: “Build it back bigger than ever.”<br />Matt Silveira<br />Placerville, Calif."
