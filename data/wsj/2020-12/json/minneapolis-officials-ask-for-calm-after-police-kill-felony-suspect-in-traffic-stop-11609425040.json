Shouts of “Hands up, hands up…police!” can be heard. The man appears to shoot first, breaking the driver-side window. Police then fire at the car.<br />“A tragic and difficult day is capping what’s been a tragic and difficult year,” said Mayor Jacob Frey. “Our city is experiencing a lot of raw emotion right now.”<br />Chief Medaria Arradondo said in a Thursday press conference that he had met with family members of the man who was killed by police and watched the body camera footage with them before releasing it to the public."
