    "body": "Brexit negotiations are set to enter a last decisive phase as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to travel to Brussels on Wednesday in a bid to secure a deal over the European Unionâ€™s relations with the U.K.<br />Failure to reach a deal would mean from the start of next year tariffs would be applied for the first time in almost a half-century on some trade between the U.K. and the trade bloc to which it sends 43% of its exports.<br />It would also end many types of cooperation between the U.K. and the EU over crime, security and travel, and corrode relations between close American allies in Europe as a new administration comes to power in Washington.<br />Even with a deal, obstacles to trade will increase, adding costs and delays for importers and exporters on both sides of the border.<br />The climax of the talks comes as the U.K. and EU are battling the coronavirus pandemic and the economic cost of government efforts to contain it. The U.K. has been one of the worst-hit countries, with gross domestic product at the end of the third quarter almost 10% smaller than it was a year earlier. Almost 70,000 deaths in the U.K. have been linked to Covid-19, giving the country one of the worst per capita death tolls in Europe."
