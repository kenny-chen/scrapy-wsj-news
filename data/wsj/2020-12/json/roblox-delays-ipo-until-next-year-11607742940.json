    "body": "Roblox Corp. delayed its planned IPO after company officials decided that the gravity-defying performance this week of  Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.  made it too difficult to determine the right price for the videogame companyâ€™s shares.<br />Roblox had been set to go public in December, part of a year-end rush of companies seeking to tap the red-hot market for initial public offerings. Just like with other recent issues, the San Mateo, Calif., company, valued at around $4 billion earlier this year, was expected to draw strong investor demand.<br />But it announced to employees in a memo late Friday that the listing would be delayed until early next year.<br />The surprise move comes at the tail end of a week to remember in the IPO market. Shares of Airbnb and DoorDash soared beyond expectations when they began trading Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.<br />The companies, which have yet to turn consistent profits, are now valued at $97 billion and $65 billion, respectively, on a fully diluted basis. Shares of artificial-intelligence-software company  C3.ai Inc.  also spiked on their first day of trading."
