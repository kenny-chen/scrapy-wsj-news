    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that federal agents can be sued for putting Muslim men on the no-fly list in alleged retaliation for their refusal to cooperate with counterterrorism investigations.<br />The decision, a rare expansion of personal liability for law-enforcement misconduct, was one of four unanimous rulings the court issued Thursday, the first opinions it has announced since the start of its annual term in October.<br />The court also found that there is no statute of limitations on when rape charges can be filed in the armed services, and that state regulation of pharmacy benefit managers isn’t superseded by federal law. The day’s fourth decision dismissed on procedural grounds a challenge to Delaware’s unique requirement for partisan balance on the state courts.<br />The no-fly case brought together two sometimes different legal threads on the Supreme Court: a conservative push to expand protections for religious expression and the liberal interest in accountability for misconduct by law enforcement.<br />Three Muslim men, a U.S. citizen and two permanent residents, alleged that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents pressured them to serve as informers on fellow Muslims. After they refused, the agents retaliated by placing them on the no-fly list, a secret roster of people U.S. authorities forbid from boarding commercial aircraft over terrorism concerns."
