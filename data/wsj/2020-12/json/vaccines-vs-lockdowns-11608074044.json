    "body": "Charlie Baker has become my model of a pandemic governor. Twice I’ve commended him for admitting, as early as April, that his state’s contact-tracing effort was mainly a show so voters would see that Massachusetts wasn’t sitting on its hands. In November, his outdoor mask-wearing mandate was panned as unscientific and unenforceable. He acknowledged as much, saying it was a signal, a new way to get the public’s attention.<br />Pandemic theater is too pejorative a term. Mr. Baker gets credit in this column for exhibiting realistically the relationship between science and politics. Science can tell us many things. It can’t tell us what to do.<br />In the West Africa Ebola outbreak of 2014, amid much  scientific tut-tutting, the governors of New York, New Jersey, California and Illinois demanded medically unnecessary quarantines for returning aid workers as cheap insurance against panic infecting the nation’s three biggest mass-transit systems.<br />Masks were downplayed early in the current crisis to preserve supplies for medical personnel, then were touted as a universal solution even though the fine print noted that masks might not stop anyone from getting the infection, only from spreading it. Political calculation was present in both messages.<br />Politics is the proper business of our leaders even when entangled with the incentives of personal career survival. We’ve seen the effect in the partisan scrum, mostly irrelevant, over testing as well as in ill-advised lockdown measures adopted by local politicians panicking over a virus that hadn’t yet reached them."
