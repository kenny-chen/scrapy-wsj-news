    "body": "When will Covid-19 vaccines be available for children, and will they be safe?<br />Parents are asking those questions as the first Covid vaccine authorized for adults and older teens begins to roll out across the country. But the timeline for children is still unclear. Here’s what parents need to know.<br />Why isn’t a vaccine available for children yet?<br />Researchers have yet to begin clinical trials in children under 12; trials in teens have just recently started. It’s not unusual in drug development to test adults first: New drugs and vaccines are often tested on adults before children, whose bodies are still developing and can have different responses to medication. In the case of Covid, adults are also generally more at risk for severe complications. Covid vaccines for younger children especially may require different dosage levels or formulations than the adult versions. Kids generally can’t get the vaccine until it is approved for their specific age.<br />The result is a delay in children having access to the vaccine, creating uncertainty over whether kids will be vaccinated before the start of the 2021 school year."
