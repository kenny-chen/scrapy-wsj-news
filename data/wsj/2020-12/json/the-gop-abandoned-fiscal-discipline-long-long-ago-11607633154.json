    "body": "It is quite comical that Kimberley Strassel believes that Republicans should suddenly have the discipline to “unite around a bedrock conservative principle: fiscal discipline” (“McConnell’s Spending Line,” Potomac Watch, Dec. 4). Donald Trump and Senate Republicans increased the debt by $6.7 trillion over the last four years. To put that in perspective, the Obama administration increased the debt by $8.6 trillion over eight years. In real dollar terms, the last four years saw the greatest spending increase in U.S. history. In other words, apart from perhaps Rand Paul, the redistributionists on the right long ago lost the ability to cry foul over spending.<br />Matt Elbert<br />Houston"
