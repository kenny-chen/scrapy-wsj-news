    "body": "While Christopher Caldwell has outlined the rigid secularism of President Emmanuel Macron (“Macron Seeks an Enlightened Islam,” Houses of Worship, Dec. 4), a more promising path for integrating Islam into French society is the laïcité positive advocated by former President Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr. Sarkozy insisted, to the surprise of his contemporaries, that religion must have some serious role in French society. His endorsement was strongly seconded by Pope Benedict XVI who both in France and the U.S. spoke of a “healthy secularism,” one in which the government, while always maintaining its autonomy, recognized the spiritual and transcendent dimension of humanity. Failing such recognition, Islam will remain a polarizing and unassimilated element within French society.<br />Rev. Prof. Thomas G. Guarino<br />Seton Hall University<br />South Orange, N.J.<br />"
