    "body": "Guess who’s Goya’s “Employee of the Month?” The honor goes to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), who famously supported the boycott of Goya Foods earlier this year after CEO Robert Unanue visited the Trump White House as part of a Hispanic Prosperity Initiative.<br />Mr. Unanue broke the news Monday during an interview with “The Michael Berry Show.” “When she boycotted us, our sales actually increased 1,000%,” Mr. Unanue said. “So we gave her an honorary. We never were able to hand it to her, but she got employee of the month for bringing attention to Goya and our adobo.”<br />Ms. Ocasio-Cortez now denies that she ever called for a boycott, tweeting that all she did was tweet about learning to make her own adobo, and that any suggestion otherwise is a matter of Fox News indulging in “their made up fantasies.” Adobo happens to be one of Goya’s most popular seasonings and her search for an alternative came in the thick of the boycott calls. CNN reported at the time that “Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet that she’d boycott Goya.”<br />We’re glad that Mr. Unanue, who pointed out he’d participated in similar initiatives for Barack and Michelle Obama, never backed down and his company wasn’t harmed. Maybe the Congresswoman needs a better sense of humor."
