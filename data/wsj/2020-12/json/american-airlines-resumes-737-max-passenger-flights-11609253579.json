    "body": "American Airlines Group Inc.  put passengers back on  Boeing Co. ’s 737 MAX for the first time in the U.S. since the aircraft was grounded nearly two years ago following two deadly crashes.<br />American Flight 718 departed Miami International Airport around 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday and landed at New York’s LaGuardia Airport at 1:10 p.m. American said the flight was mostly full and that airline President Robert Isom was among the passengers.<br />Daily round-trip flights between Miami and New York are the start of American’s plans to gradually return the MAX to service. An American spokeswoman said the airline has begun announcing aircraft types during boarding to make sure passengers are aware when they are flying on a MAX. American will also alert passengers if they are suddenly scheduled to fly on a MAX due to a schedule change, she said.<br />David Seymour, American’s chief operating officer, said gradually reintroducing the MAX would help build customer confidence and give passengers flexibility if they initially prefer to fly on other aircraft. He said in an interview earlier this month that American pilots and flight attendants are confident of the plane’s safety.<br />“We would have never brought the aircraft back if they were not comfortable,” he said."
