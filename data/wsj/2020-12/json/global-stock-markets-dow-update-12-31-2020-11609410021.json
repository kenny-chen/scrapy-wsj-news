    "body": "U.S. stock futures wobbled Thursday, signaling a muted finish to a year that saw the major indexes contract sharply in the spring before snapping back to cinch record highs.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 and contracts linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average wavered between gains and losses, indicating that gauges may take a breather in the final day of trading for 2020. Nasdaq-100 index futures were also relatively flat. Trading volumes have eased this week with many people taking year-end holidays.<br />The tepid end belies a year that saw stocks bounce back since the March rout despite the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The unprecedented steps taken by major central banks to bolster credit flow and the increase in governments’ spending encouraged investors to focus on growth opportunities despite the economic havoc.<br />That helped the three major indexes notch 100 record closes so far in 2020, with the Dow hitting its 13th all time finishing high of the year on Wednesday.<br />“When you look at the entire year, you could say policy makers drowned the black swan,” said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro research at ING Groep."
