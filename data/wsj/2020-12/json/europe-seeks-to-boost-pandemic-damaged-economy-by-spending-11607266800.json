    "body": "Europe hopes to spur an economic recovery from the pandemic by boosting government spending, a shift in strategy from the 2008 financial crisis that economists say could lift the global economy.<br />Two events in the coming week are set to underscore the change.<br />First, European Union leaders on Thursday will begin a series of virtual meetings aimed at gaining final approval of a €750 billion fund, the equivalent of $912 billion, borrowed by the bloc as a whole to aid countries hit hardest by the pandemic’s effects.<br />The European Central Bank the same day will almost certainly announce an expansion of its bond-purchasing program, with the explicit aim of keeping down borrowing costs for governments, thereby enabling them to spend more freely.<br />That combination is intended to place government spending at the heart of efforts to stimulate Europe’s economy in 2021 and beyond."
