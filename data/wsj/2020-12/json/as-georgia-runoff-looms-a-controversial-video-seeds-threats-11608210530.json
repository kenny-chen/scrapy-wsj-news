    "body": "In the middle of Georgia’s third recount of the presidential election ballots last month, Republican official B.J. Van Gundy noticed something he thought was strange: a technician inserting a thumb drive into one of the election workstations before plugging it into a laptop computer.<br />What he didn’t expect was that a video of the man’s actions would go viral online hours later, with the technician falsely accused of manipulating votes, threatened with hanging, and his home address splashed across far-right message boards and social media.<br />“I think it’s horrible,” said Mr. Van Gundy, the assistant secretary of Georgia’s Republican Party. “I don’t think he should have had to experience this…Lynch mobs are not an allowed thing.”<br />The technician, who was sent to provide support for the Gwinnett County recount by the election-equipment company Dominion Voting Systems Corp., couldn't be reached by phone or email, and Dominion declined to make him available to be interviewed.<br />Dominion declined to comment for this article. Testifying before Michigan lawmakers Tuesday, CEO John Poulos said, “Dominion has recently been thrust into the national spotlight as part of a dangerous and reckless disinformation campaign aimed at sowing doubt and confusion over the 2020 presidential election.”"
