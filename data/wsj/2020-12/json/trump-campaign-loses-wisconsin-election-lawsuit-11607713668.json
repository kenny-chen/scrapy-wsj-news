    "body": "A Wisconsin state judge on Friday rejected a Trump campaign lawsuit seeking to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s narrow victory there, ruling that a partial recount was fairly conducted.<br />The Wisconsin suit is one of the last remaining cases in the Trump campaign’s quest to reverse the Nov. 3 election results, an effort that constitutional scholars have said is unprecedented and unlikely to succeed.<br />President Trump is also supporting a lawsuit filed with the U.S. Supreme Court by the Texas attorney general, arguing that election results in four battleground states Mr. Biden won—Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia—were so flawed they should be thrown out. That suit is supported by at least 17 other Republican attorneys general and 106 GOP members of Congress, but is opposed by Democratic attorneys general and some Republican senators and state officials.<br />In Wisconsin, the Trump campaign sought to have 220,000 mail-in and absentee ballots thrown out from Dane County, home to Madison, and Milwaukee County, the two most urban, diverse and Democratic counties in the state.<br />The campaign earlier requested a recount in those two counties, though the new tally slightly increased Mr. Biden’s lead of about 20,000."
