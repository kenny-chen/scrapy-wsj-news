Elevated coronavirus infection levels and a new variant of Covid-19 that emerged in the U.K. have prompted concerns that there may be additional lockdown measures in the winter months, weighing on market sentiment.<br />“The market is so on edge at the moment. People are worried about more lockdowns, more travel restrictions,” said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for State Street Global Advisors in Europe. “This will continue to bounce the market around.”"
