    "body": "U.S. health regulators on Friday permitted use of  Moderna Inc.’s  Covid-19 vaccine, the second shot to get the green light to help end the deadliest pandemic in more than a century.<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s authorization of Moderna’s vaccine in people ages 18 years and older comes a week after the agency authorized the first shot in the U.S., from  Pfizer Inc.  and its partner  BioNTech SE .<br />Testing of the vaccine found that it protected against developing Covid-19 and was safe, though some study subjects experienced side effects including fevers, muscle aches and pains.<br />Moderna, a 10-year-old biotech that has never had a product cleared by the FDA, has made millions of doses already. Federal officials expect Moderna to begin shipping within 24 hours of authorization, and hospitals and other vaccination sites will receive the shots as early as Monday.<br />“It is my hope that all Americans will protect themselves by getting vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them. That is how our country will begin to heal and move forward,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which helped Moderna develop the vaccine."
