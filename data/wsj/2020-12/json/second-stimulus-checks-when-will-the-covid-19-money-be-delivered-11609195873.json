    "body": "President Trump on Dec. 27 signed into law a roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid package that will provide a second round of stimulus payments to households. Here is what we know about who will receive the checks and how they will receive the money.<br />Households will get $600 per adult and $600 a child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round delivered earlier in the pandemic. That means a single parent with two children will get $1,800 now after receiving $2,200 in the spring.<br />In all, the government will spend $164 billion on the second round.<br />The payments start phasing out when individual adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000, when head-of-household income exceeds $112,500, and when income for married couples filing jointly exceeds $150,000. For individuals without children, the payments go to zero when income reaches $87,000; that is $174,000 for married couples. The numbers are generally based on 2019 income.<br />Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week, when Congress was finishing work on the package, that the first batch of payments could go out at the beginning of the Dec. 28 week. But Mr. Trump didn’t sign the package until Sunday night—six days after final congressional approval. A senior Treasury official on Monday said the department anticipates being able to make the $600 stimulus payments “on the same timeline as previously discussed.”"
