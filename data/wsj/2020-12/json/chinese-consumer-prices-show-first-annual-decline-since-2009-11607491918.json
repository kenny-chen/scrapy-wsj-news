    "body": "China’s consumer prices dropped for the first time in over a decade in November, though economists say the decrease doesn’t signal faltering demand in the world’s second-largest economy.<br />The fall was driven by volatile food prices, including the continued retreat of pork prices as supply recovers from the ravages of African swine fever. Other economic indicators have shown a continued recovery from Covid-19 shocks.<br />China’s consumer-price index in November was down 0.5% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday, after a 0.5% rise in October. It was the first negative reading since October 2009. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast November’s CPI would come in flat.<br />The statistics bureau said food prices, down 2.0% from a year earlier, weighed heavily on November’s headline CPI. In October, food prices were up 2.2% from a year earlier.<br />Among foods, pork—the main source of protein in the Chinese diet—extended its decline, down 12.5% in November after October’s 2.8% drop."
