    "body": "In “The Monday When America Came Back” (Declarations, Dec. 19), Peggy Noonan elegantly outlines the miracle of the vaccine. But as I continued reading, I waited for her to explain how this miracle was made possible. Finally, at the end, when she mentioned a man “half crazy, almost a genius,” I knew the moment was near: She would finally mention the leader behind it all, the reason for our Christmas miracle. But she never did. And what an incredible disappointment. Operation Warp Speed wasn’t mentioned once. Neither was the president’s name.<br />Frank Sciame<br />Locust Valley, N.Y.<br /><br />Even when I disagree with Ms. Noonan, I appreciate her skill with a pen—or keyboard. But I do wish she and other Journal columnists would quit using “they” to refer to the people frequently labeled “elites.” Ms. Noonan did it when writing about the “professional class of politicians, media people, scientists and credentialed chatterers.”"
