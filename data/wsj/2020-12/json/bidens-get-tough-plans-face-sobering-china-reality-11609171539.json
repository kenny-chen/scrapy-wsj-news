    "body": "As President-elect Joe Biden’s team prepares to move in, there’s a lot of loose talk in Washington about getting tougher with China, and beginning the process of decoupling the two nations’ economies.<br />As is often the case with loose talk, though, reality is a lot more complicated. Getting tougher economically will be, well, tough.<br />Despite four years of pressure from the Trump administration, China’s economy actually is stronger in some ways at the moment than is the economy of the West. Though China has plenty of its own problems, international capital is flowing in, not out. Within Asia, China actually has improved its trade position.<br />“China is in a strong negotiating situation,” says Josh Lipsky, director of programs and policy at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center. He adds: “The centrifugal forces coming out of China are stronger than they were in 2017.”<br />Indeed, the International Monetary Fund projects that China’s economy will expand by 1.9% in 2020, which means it is likely to be the only major world economy to grow in this year of the coronavirus pandemic. By contrast, the American economy is expected to shrink by 4.3%, and the eurozone is forecast to contract by 8.3%."
