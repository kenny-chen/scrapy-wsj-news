    "body": "While your editorial “Trump’s Fraud Claims Hit a Barr” (Dec. 2) goes a long way to highlight the lack of hard evidence for the administration’s case, it does little to refute the overall perception of a rigged election. Over half of Republicans believe the election was “rigged” This may persist in the perception that the Biden administration is now continually under the cloud of illegitimacy. The confidence level in America’s election process has fallen to the level of confidence the electorate has in Congress—dangerous for a form of democratic governance.<br />James Bullard<br />Brighton, Mich.<br /><br />In my little, 80-home neighborhood, the roll of registered voters shows at least five homes with two sets of families, reflecting both the previous and current owners. An additional two people who have died are on the roll. And several young adults who have moved away from their parents’ home are still on the roll. If they had been automatically mailed ballots, more than 10% of homes would have received extra ballots. This is the reality in a state that actually maintains the voter rolls, in a stable neighborhood of mostly middle-aged adults. Imagine what the rate is in, say, an apartment complex."
