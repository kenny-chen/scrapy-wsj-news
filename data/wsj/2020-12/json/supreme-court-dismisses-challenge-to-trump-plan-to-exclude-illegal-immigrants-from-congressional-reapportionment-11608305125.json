    "body": "WASHINGTON—A divided Supreme Court dismissed a challenge to President Trump’s plan to exclude immigrants in the U.S. illegally from the counts used to determine congressional seats, with the conservative majority saying it was premature to rule before it was clear that the outgoing administration could implement the policy.<br />The justices voted 6-3 to dismiss the case. In a dissent, the court’s three liberals argued that there was no need to wait before ruling that Mr. Trump’s initiative violated federal law.<br />The Trump administration’s plan, announced in July, could shift House seats from immigrant-rich states such as California to more rural, Republican-leaning areas with less diverse populations. Under federal law, state population totals must be sent to the president by Dec. 31 and he must deliver them to the newly elected House within a week of its opening, which normally occurs Jan. 3.<br />But the 2020 census count, disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, is behind schedule, and a House committee said earlier this month that the figures wouldn’t be ready before Jan. 23. That is three days after Mr. Trump leaves office, meaning that President-elect Joe Biden could cancel the exclusion plan once he is sworn in.<br />Even if Mr. Trump is able to transmit numbers before Jan. 20, an administration lawyer told the Supreme Court at a hearing last month that it wasn’t clear how many noncitizens lacking legal status feasibly could be removed from the apportionment base."
