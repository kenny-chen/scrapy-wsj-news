    "body": "Shares in  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  tumbled Thursday, extending a recent pullback, as China stepped up pressure on the e-commerce giant and its billionaire co-founder Jack Ma.<br />Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock dropped 8.1% to 228.20 Hong Kong dollars, its lowest point since July, in a shortened pre-Christmas trading session. The decline means Alibaba has now fallen more than 25% since a late October peak, when it was riding high ahead of a planned blockbuster listing of its financial-technology affiliate, Ant Group.<br />On Thursday, Chinese regulators said they were taking actions against Alibaba and Ant Group, weeks after China stopped an expected $34 billion listing by Ant in Hong Kong and Shanghai.<br />The State Administration for Market Regulation said it was investigating complaints of potentially monopolistic behavior—like making merchants sell exclusively on Alibaba platforms—while China’s central bank said it and other regulators had summoned Ant officials for a meeting.<br />In recent weeks, Chinese officials and regulators have also issued draft antitrust guidelines for internet platforms; cautioned that some companies could become “too big to fail”; and warned them not to engage in practices such as predatory pricing, abusing consumer data, or selling fraudulent products."
