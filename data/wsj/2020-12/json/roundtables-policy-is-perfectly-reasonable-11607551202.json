    "body": "Regarding “What Do We Expect From Our Corporations?” (Letters, Dec. 4): As the former president of a small, highly successful technology company, I don’t understand the criticism, even animosity, of some toward the Business Roundtable’s policy recommendations that companies 1) work in the interest of shareholders, 2) commit to delivering value to customers, 3) invest in employees, 4) deal fairly and ethically with suppliers, and 5) support local communities. These interests aren’t mutually exclusive but in fact are mutually dependent. I understood that to support our shareholders’ interests, we had to do the latter four things well to be successful, though I did have the view that providing well-paying jobs was our biggest contribution to the community. If we failed at the latter four, we were far less likely to be successful at our first priority, and the better we did those four, the more successful we were likely to be. I also understood that if we didn’t make a reasonable profit for our shareholders and for investing in R&D, growth in our markets, etc., then we couldn’t do the other four because we wouldn’t exist.<br />Ron Moore<br />Knoxville, Tenn."
