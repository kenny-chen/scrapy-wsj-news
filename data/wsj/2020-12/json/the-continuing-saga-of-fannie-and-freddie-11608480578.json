    "body": "In Washington, “least bad” solutions are often the best that the political process can produce (“The Fannie and Freddie Conundrum,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 9). But releasing government-sponsored enterprises  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  from conservatorship with little capital and no reforms is no solution at all. It would undermine investor confidence, create volatility in the mortgage market and impede access to credit for consumers. Why upend the mortgage market at a time when it is one of the few economic bright spots?  Moody’s  recently wrote that an exit from conservatorship without a government guarantee could result in a downgrade in the GSEs’ debt ratings.<br />The Mortgage Bankers Association doesn’t support an endless conservatorship; we believe the Treasury Department should work with the Federal Housing Finance Agency to implement reforms so that Fannie and Freddie can eventually operate outside of government control. These reforms include equal secondary market access for all lenders regardless of size, business model, or volume of loans delivered to the GSEs; strict limits on the size and use of the GSEs’ mortgage investment portfolios; and the promotion of credit-risk transfers to protect taxpayers.<br />Bob Broeksmit<br />President & CEO<br />Mortgage Bankers Association"
