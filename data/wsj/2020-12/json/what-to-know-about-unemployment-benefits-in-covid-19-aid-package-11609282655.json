    "body": "President Trump on Dec. 27 signed a $900 billion aid package into law that expands the amount and duration of unemployment benefits available to millions of laid-off workers. The law extends two pandemic-related programs used by 14 million people and provides for a period of supplemental $300 payments to all recipients of unemployment benefits.<br />Here is what we know about the status of the unemployment-insurance programs under the new legislation:<br />Which pandemic-related unemployment programs will continue?<br />Two pandemic-related programs will continue through March 14. Pandemic Unemployment Assistance is available to the self-employed, gig workers and others not typically eligible for unemployment aid. Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, another federal program that provided up to 13 weeks of additional payments to people who exhausted regular state benefits, will also be extended.<br />Both programs, which were established in response to the coronavirus pandemic, were slated to end Dec. 31. Because states pay out benefits on a weekly basis, the programs effectively expired in the week ended Dec. 26 or 27, unemployment-insurance experts say."
