    "body": "Kaneisha Miller, owner of EM Farms in Monroe County, Ga., says she sees Republican-championed policies such as widespread tax cuts as better for her own bottom line, which should be a good sign for the two GOP senators fighting to hold their seats in the Jan. 5 runoff races in Georgia.<br />It isn’t.<br />“I’m still going to stay Democratic, mostly because I’m Black,” said Ms. Miller, 30 years old. “You can always get money. But I know that the Democratic Party usually treats people more equal.”<br />The November election reinforced a pattern showing that party affiliation is increasingly connected with where voters live. Rural voters across the country overwhelmingly supported President Trump, while American cities remained Democratic strongholds, and this year, once reliably Republican suburbs shifted to blue.<br />Black Americans have bucked those trends by largely supporting Democrats regardless of whether they live in big cities, suburbs or rural areas, according to voter surveys and a comparison of demographic data and election results."
