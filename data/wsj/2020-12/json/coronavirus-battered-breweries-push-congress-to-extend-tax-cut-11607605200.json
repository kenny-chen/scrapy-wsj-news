    "body": "Brad Hittle, chief executive of Two Roads Brewing Co. in Stratford, Conn., has had a brutal roller coaster of a year, and now he is facing a tax increase if Congress doesn’t act soon.<br />Business at the craft brewery off Interstate 95 plummeted in March as the coronavirus spread. Mr. Hittle furloughed his sales staff and cut pay, then benefited from a Paycheck Protection Program loan and a summer outdoor-dining boomlet before cold weather lowered demand again.<br />“I feel like I’m in a boxing ring. And after Round 1 I was bloodied, and Round 2 I fought back,” he said. “Round 3: I’m getting bloodied again.”<br />The punches are a combination of the resurging pandemic, new dining restrictions and the excise-tax increase that is slated for January.<br />Two Roads is among brewers, wineries and distilleries across the country pressing Congress to continue excise-tax cuts that were created in the 2017 tax law, extended last year and now are set to lapse Dec. 31."
