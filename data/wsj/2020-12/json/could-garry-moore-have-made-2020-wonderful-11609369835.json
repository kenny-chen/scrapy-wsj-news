    "body": "Even Garry Moore, may his ever-sunny soul rest in peace, might be hard-pressed to come up with an upbeat way to frame this year.<br />Moore (1915-93) was an amiable, crew-cut, bowtie-wearing broadcaster during the early years of television. He was the host of the popular game shows “I’ve Got a Secret” and “To Tell the Truth,” and Americans liked his friendly manner so much that  CBS  gave him his own prime-time variety show.<br />In those years you could count the number of TV channels on one hand. Many families had only one set. Programs had to try to appeal to everyone in the household, and Moore’s cheery, nonconfrontational personality made him an ideal front man.<br />The signature feature on “The Garry Moore Show” was something he called “That Wonderful Year.” Each week, he would tell his nationwide audience how terrific a specific year in the 20th century had been. You couldn’t name a year that he didn’t think had been marvelous.<br />Wearing a fedora and cupping a cigarette in his right hand, Moore would walk between stage-set streetlights. He seemed to be emulating Frank Sinatra’s “In the Wee Small Hours” record-album cover, but helpful-next-door-neighbor Garry Moore, the fellow who would lend you a rake, couldn’t really pull off ring-a-ding-ding."
