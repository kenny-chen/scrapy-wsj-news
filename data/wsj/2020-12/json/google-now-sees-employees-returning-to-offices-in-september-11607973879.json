    "body": "Google plans to have employees return to offices starting next fall instead of the summer, but the technology giant will test allowing staff to continue working from home for part of each workweek.<br />Google’s parent,  Alphabet Inc.,  now expects that workers will start showing up in offices again in September, according to a report in the New York Times. Google confirmed the report and declined to comment further.<br />That is a shift from an earlier plan that had workers returning in July, and from one that would have required employees to return to work next month. Based in Mountain View, Calif., Alphabet said it had about 119,000 full-time workers as of the end of last year, according to its most recent annual company filing. It also hires contract workers.<br />Google also will pilot an option for employees to work at least three days a week in offices and do their jobs remotely the remainder of the days, according to the report.<br />Companies across the country transitioned workforces to remote work earlier this year to try to halt the spread of the coronavirus. As Covid-19 vaccines are distributed, businesses are sorting out when—and if, in some cases—they plan to require workers to start showing up at offices once again."
