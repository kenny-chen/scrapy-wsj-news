    "body": "Rep. Mike Gallagher omits the main points that augur in favor of retired generals serving as defense secretary (“No More Generals Atop the Pentagon,” op-ed, Dec. 21). If people richly experienced in dealing with crises, the endless funding trade-offs and the personal cost of conflict are ruled out, then we’re likely to get someone who is politically oriented, academically experienced and beholden to a party. I’ve seen enough of the dilettantes. Give me someone mature and savvy enough to doubt the generals, someone more loyal to the 20-year-olds than to his political sponsors.<br />Lloyd Austin worked for me or with me for nearly two years, and I know him to be a man of impeccable character with a razor-sharp intellect and a serene approach to crises. He is what America has been missing, so don’t allow the notional to preclude the necessary.<br />Lt. Gen. (ret.) Greg Newbold<br />United States Marine Corps<br />Flat Rock, N.C."
