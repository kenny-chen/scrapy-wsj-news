    "body": "December has been the worst month yet for Samson Tours Inc., an Atlanta bus operator.<br />The company expects revenue to total just $30,000 in December, less than 10% of pre-pandemic levels and down from $118,000 in November. It has laid off or furloughed all but three of its 65 employees.<br />“This month has had the least revenue of all of them since March,” said Chief Executive John Sambdman. “It’s getting worse every day.”<br />The company’s most reliable clients have scaled back or temporarily stopped their use of buses. Public schools in Atlanta are expected to operate remotely until at least late January, military transportation has dwindled and corporate charters have all but evaporated.<br />Mr. Sambdman has taken himself off payroll, set aside $50,000 for attorneys’ fees in case the company must file for bankruptcy next year and accelerated plans to move into a smaller, less costly home."
