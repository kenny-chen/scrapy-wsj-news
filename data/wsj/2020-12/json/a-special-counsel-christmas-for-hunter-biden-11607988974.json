    "body": "Will Hunter Biden wake up to a special counsel in his Christmas stocking?<br />News reports say President Trump wants his attorney general to name one. The law says a special counsel is warranted in a criminal investigation when leaving it to the Justice Department presents “a conflict of interest.” It’s hard to imagine a more unambiguous conflict of interest than the one Hunter Biden presents: A Joe Biden Justice Department investigating his son over conduct that might also implicate the sitting president.<br />Even so, a special counsel is a bad idea.<br />Two weeks ago, Mr. Barr announced that in October he’d appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham as special counsel for the investigation into the origins of the FBI’s Russia-collusion probe. He did so to ensure Mr. Durham could finish his investigation regardless of the election outcome.<br />The argument was that the magnitude and nature of the allegation—that those at the uppermost levels of the government abused their power to intervene in a U.S. election and then to undermine a duly elected president—made appointing a special counsel the lesser of evils. It’s a strong argument, and it has persuaded many who otherwise rightly regard the institution of special counsel as pernicious."
