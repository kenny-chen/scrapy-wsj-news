    "body": "Jason Butler Harner, 50, is an actor who has appeared on TV’s “Homeland,” “Scandal” and “Ozark.” He co-stars in Fox’s crime-drama series “Next.” He spoke with Marc Myers.<br />The silence is what I remember most when I watched my dad work on home-design projects. As a child, the quiet made me think, giving me a work ethic and sense of pride in a job well done.<br />I also learned that projects take time and stamina. A project is about accomplishment, not instant gratification. Those lessons came in handy later as an actor.<br />My family lived first in Elmira, N.Y., but moved to Alexandria, Va., when I was 5. My mother, Sandra, was recruited by United Way to become their first female v.p., in communications.<br />Mom was 5 feet tall, which served her well. She was a pixie with a lot of moxie. My father, Ed, studied for his degree in economics and eventually worked at a senior level for FEMA."
