    "body": "WASHINGTON—Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts closed out 2020 by recounting the federal judiciary’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, a public-health emergency that disrupted the justice system from traffic court to the marble edifice of the high court itself.<br />Federal judges and the court system’s support staff have adopted remote hearings, installed plexiglass barriers in courtrooms and taken many other steps to continue work while reducing the risk of infection, the chief justice wrote in his year-end report on the federal judiciary.<br />“District judges are privileged to perform naturalization ceremonies and welcome new citizens. But the coronavirus has made it difficult to conduct traditional court-house ceremonies safely,” the chief justice wrote in the report, an annual summary published each Dec. 31.<br />“So judges in Michigan and Florida held drive-through naturalizations. Others, in Iowa and Minnesota, moved the ceremonies outdoors,” he wrote, “borrowing a practice from a century ago, when San Francisco courts held proceedings outdoors during the Spanish flu pandemic.”<br />The high court sent employees to work from home in March, and in May began hearing cases by teleconference, a practice that continues. But the coronavirus, the chief justice observed, wasn’t the first pathogen to disrupt the Supreme Court’s work."
