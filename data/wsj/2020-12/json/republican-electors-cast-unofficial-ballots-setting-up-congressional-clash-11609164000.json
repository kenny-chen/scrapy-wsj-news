    "body": "When Nevada Democrats gathered on Dec. 14 to cast Electoral College votes for Joe Biden, the winner of the state’s presidential election, Shawn Meehan and his fellow Silver State Republicans held their own meeting and voted for President Trump.<br />Mr. Meehan was among pro-Trump electors to cast symbolic ballots for the president in at least seven states he lost, hoping Congress will accept their votes—and not those cast by electors for Mr. Biden—on Jan. 6, when it officially counts the Electoral College votes.<br />“Trump won, and we have a duty to cast our votes,” said Mr. Meehan, 54 years old, a retired veteran of the U.S. Air Force. “We’re preserving our right while there’s ongoing litigation.”<br />Election-law scholars and historians say the effort is political theater and the votes hold no legal weight because they weren’t certified by state officials. Alexander Keyssar, professor of history and social policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, compared the GOP meetings to playing dress up.<br />“The slate might appear to be valid, but it isn’t being put forth by any governmental or legislative body,” said Mr. Keyssar, who has written books about the Electoral College."
