    "body": "U.S. government-bond prices fell Wednesday as investors reacted to signs that U.K. and European Union officials were closing in on a new trade accord that would avoid tariffs being imposed at the start of next year.<br />In recent trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 0.960%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 0.917% Tuesday.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, initially declined early in the overnight session after President Trump criticized the roughly $900 billion coronavirus relief deal passed by Congress, raising questions about whether he might veto the legislation.<br />Yields, though, later reversed course and rose sharply in response to headlines that the U.K and EU might reach a trade deal as early as Wednesday. Absent a deal, tariffs would be applied Jan. 1 for the first time in nearly 50 years on some trade between the U.K. and the EU, causing an unwelcome economic disruption as countries are struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.<br />More directly impacted by the trade news, yields on European government bonds also climbed, with the 10-year German bond yield rising to minus 0.541% from minus 0.589% and the 10-year U.K. yield jumping to 0.285% from 0.186%. In volatile trading, the British pound was recently up around 1.2% against the dollar at $1.3521."
