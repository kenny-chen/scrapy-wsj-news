    "body": "It was a few days before Christmas, and Jemimah Juane wasn’t sure if her acting skills were up to the challenge.<br />Ms. Juane’s family had relied on online vendors to get their gift shopping done. When she logged into the family’s shared Amazon account, Ms. Juane, 21, inadvertently glimpsed a ukulele that her parents had purchased as her gift. She told her brother, who said she should feign surprise on Christmas.<br />Ms. Juane spent a night mulling it over before telling her parents what she’d seen. “I didn’t want them to be disappointed if I couldn’t be, like, ‘Oh, my gosh!’” says Ms. Juane, a day-care worker in Dallas.<br />This holiday season has seen a boom in online shopping.

At the same time, millions of Americans receiving gifts shipped from loved ones are finding the parade of identical cardboard boxes can be hard to distinguish from their own purchases—with many mistakenly opening their presents long before Christmas morning.<br />When a package arrived on Aimee Truchan’s doorstep in San Diego earlier this month, she did what she always does and casually slit it open."
