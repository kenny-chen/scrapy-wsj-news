    "body": "Most of the blowback from Joseph Epstein’s op-ed “Is There a Doctor in the White House? Not if You Need an M.D.” (Dec. 12) is coming from those who imagine it had to do with Jill Biden’s being a woman. That’s wrong.<br />I taught at a university whose president, a former football coach who held a degree in physical education, wrote a book titled “Nobody Calls Me Doctor.” Bud Davis was an amiable fellow, willing to laugh about his degree.<br />There are degrees, however, that mean something. Readers of Boswell’s “Life of Johnson” will recall that Samuel Johnson had to leave Oxford early after the death of his father and became Dr. Johnson only after he had completed his great “Dictionary of the English Language.” The Oxford doctorate he was then awarded may be described as honorary but entirely real.<br />The issue raised by Mr. Epstein has nothing to do with women as such. It has to do with a certain tremulous American hypocrisy about what constitutes genuine accomplishment. The point of his article was simply that not everyone in Kentucky addressed as “colonel” was ever actually in the military.<br />Em. Prof. William C. Dowling"
