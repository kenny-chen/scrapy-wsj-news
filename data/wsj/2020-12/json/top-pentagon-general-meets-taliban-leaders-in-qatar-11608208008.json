    "body": "KABUL—The Pentagon’s top officer met with Taliban officials in Qatar this week as part of an unprecedented effort to spur stalled peace talks that could help end the nearly 20-year-old conflict in Afghanistan.<br />Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with members of the Taliban in Doha on Tuesday in hopes of persuading the group to stop fighting and move quickly toward a peace accord with the government of Afghanistan. Talks between the two sides were suspended earlier this month after disagreements over negotiating details.<br />The meeting came as Taliban-instigated violence is on the rise, military officials said, and just weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.<br />Gen. Milley met with Taliban officials in June in a session that wasn’t previously disclosed. That meeting was the first time a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had met with Taliban leaders and negotiators.<br />After Tuesday’s meeting with the Taliban in Doha, Gen. Milley flew to Kabul, where he discussed the peace talks with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani. Gen. Milley declined to discuss details of either talks."
