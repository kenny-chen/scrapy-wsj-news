    "body": "WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden is expected to tap Jeffrey Zients, a former Obama administration economic adviser, for a senior White House role overseeing the administration’s coronavirus response, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Mr. Zients is expected to work with senior officials across multiple agencies to coordinate pandemic response efforts, the people said. It couldn’t be learned when Mr. Biden would make the announcement.<br />Mr. Biden’s transition team declined to comment, and Mr. Zients didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />The Democratic president-elect is expected to fill health-care positions in his administration as coronavirus cases continue to surge across the country. The number of Covid-19-related deaths reported in a day hit a record in the U.S. this week, and newly reported infections were at their second highest level, surpassing 200,000 for the second time in less than a week.<br />Mr. Zients, a business executive, led the National Economic Council during much of then-President Barack Obama’s second term. Before that, he was a senior official and acting director at the White House Office of Management and Budget. He also played a lead role in helping to fix problems with the administration’s health-care website."
