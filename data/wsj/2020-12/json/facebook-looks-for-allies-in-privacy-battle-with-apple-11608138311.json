    "body": "Facebook Inc.  said it would assist the company behind popular videogame “Fortnite” in its high-profile legal battle with  Apple Inc.,  as the social-media giant ramps up its own counterattack against what it says are the iPhone maker’s self-serving measures cloaked in the interest of privacy.<br />Facebook has been feuding with Apple for months on issues ranging from prices for paid apps to privacy rule changes.<br />As part of a pledge to assist challenges to what it called Apple’s anticompetitive behavior, Facebook plans to provide supporting materials and documents to Epic Games Inc. The “Fortnite” parent sued Apple earlier this year, claiming the tech giant’s App Store operates like a monopoly. Facebook said it isn’t joining the lawsuit but helping with discovery as the case heads to trial next year.<br />A spokeswoman for Epic declined to comment.<br />In a blog post Wednesday Facebook also sharpened its criticism of Apple’s plan to enable users to restrict certain apps from collecting personal data, saying those policies could imperil small businesses while potentially benefiting its own bottom line."
