    "body": "Landing in a thunderstorm, an Eastern Air Lines Boeing 727 crashed and exploded on the fringes of New York’s Kennedy International Airport on June 24, 1975. Among the 113 people killed were Roger Berlind’s wife, Helen, and three of their four children.<br />Mr. Berlind, the co-founder of a securities firm, suddenly saw no meaning in his Wall Street career. “I wasn’t in any shape to do anything useful at the firm,” he told The Wall Street Journal later, “and I didn’t want to be there.” He quit his job to take care of his toddler son, William.<br />Reverting to his early love of show tunes and theater, he began investing in Broadway productions and soon found himself hooked. Over more than four decades, he had a role in producing more than 100 plays and musicals and won 25 Tony Awards. His hits included “The Book of Mormon,” “Amadeus,” “Nine,” “Sophisticated Ladies” and “City of Angels.”<br />There were also many flops, starting with his first production, in 1976: “Rex,” a Richard Rodgers-Sheldon Harnick musical about Henry VIII. A  New York Times  critic wrote that the production had “almost everything not going for it” and was “one of the most interminable musicals in years.”<br />Mr. Berlind died Dec. 18 of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Manhattan. He was 90."
