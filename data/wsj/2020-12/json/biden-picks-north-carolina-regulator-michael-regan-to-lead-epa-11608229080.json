    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden plans to nominate Michael Regan, a North Carolina environmental regulator, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and Rep. Deb Haaland (D., N.M.) as Interior secretary, people familiar with the decisions said.<br />Mr. Regan runs North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality. He spent nearly a decade early in his career at the EPA before taking on regional jobs at the Environmental Defense Fund and in his home state.<br />Mr. Biden would be appointing the second Black EPA administrator in the agency’s 50-year history at a time when he wants the agency to put more emphasis on protecting minority and poor communities disproportionately affected by pollution.<br />Ms. Haaland, an enrolled citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna in New Mexico, would be the first Native American cabinet secretary if she is confirmed to the post. She has received the support of climate-change groups and others in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.<br />Mr. Biden has been rolling out a series of picks for energy and environmental positions in recent days. He has promised to take action against climate change, including pushing power plants, oil-and-gas producers and auto makers to drastically reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions."
