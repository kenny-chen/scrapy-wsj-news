    "body": "The venture-capital offices around Silicon Valley remain largely empty, but their coffers will soon be brimming after what has shaped up to be a surprisingly resilient year for technology startups.<br />The initial public offerings this week of  DoorDash Inc.  and  Airbnb Inc.  cap a string of listings that have helped make this the most lucrative year on record for IPOs in terms of money raised.<br />More than $157 billion has been raised as of Thursday, according to data provider Dealogic—over a third of that in the past 11 weeks—and the number of listings is the largest since the final hurrah of the dot-com boom in 2000.<br />The soaring public offerings are showering returns on some of the biggest names in tech investing, in particular Sequoia Capital, which backed both DoorDash and Airbnb as well as cloud-computing company  Snowflake Inc.  and videogame company  Unity Software Inc.,  all of which ranked among the year’s 15 biggest listings, according to Dealogic.<br />The outcome is a far cry from the warning Sequoia sent to its founders and CEOs in March urging them to prepare for turbulence and disruption because of the pandemic."
