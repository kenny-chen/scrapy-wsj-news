    "body": "A frenzy has hit the market for newly listed tech stocks.<br />Last week, searing demand sent  DoorDash Inc.’s  stock up 86% in its trading debut Wednesday, while  Airbnb Inc.’s  shares more than doubled in their debut a day later. Airbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky was at a loss for words in a Bloomberg TV appearance when he was told of the company’s opening share price, while multiple investors in the two blistering offerings said they were puzzled by the extraordinary enthusiasm in the market.<br />The reception was so strong that videogame company Roblox Corp. pulled its own planned initial public offering as it tried to make sense of the market.  Another startup, financial tech company Affirm Holdings Inc., also delayed its planned IPO over the weekend, although the exact reasons weren’t clear.<br />Valuations of recent IPOs are at their highest levels since the dot-com bubble, relative to the companies’ revenue, sparking concerns among investors about the level of froth.<br />The result has been that the market capitalizations of many money-losing upstarts have become larger than giant, highly profitable stalwarts of corporate America."
