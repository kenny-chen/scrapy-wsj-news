    "body": "U.S. stock futures wobbled Thursday ahead of economic data that will provide insights into the health of the services sector and the labor market.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 wavered between tepid gains and losses, a day after the broad-market index inched up to close at another all-time high. Nasdaq-100 futures edged 0.2% higher, pointing to a muted advance in tech stocks after the opening bell.<br />Trading has been choppy this week as November’s explosive rally in global stocks lost steam. The S&P 500 has repeatedly eked out fresh records on the back of investors’ optimism that Covid-19 vaccines will accelerate the economic rebound next year. But rich valuations for stocks and elevated infection levels are tempering some of that cheer, leading to a more subdued move upward in recent days.<br />“Markets have been driving higher, seeing 2021 as the year economies will snap back,” said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. “There is concern a lot of the good news is already priced in, so I don’t expect markets to go shooting into the stratosphere any time soon, but we could see a general grind higher.”<br />Ahead of the market open, Tesla gained over 4%. A Goldman Sachs analyst upgraded the stock’s rating to buy and raised the price target. Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 later this month, which would prompt passive funds that track the index to add the stock to their portfolios."
