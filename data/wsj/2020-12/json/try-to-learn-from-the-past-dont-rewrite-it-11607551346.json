    "body": "Regarding Alessandra Bocchi’s “Ancient History Isn’t Colonialism” (op-ed, Dec. 1): To the Brown University students who feel “harmed” by “white, Western civilization” generally, and by the statues of the two Roman emperors Augustus and Aurelius specifically, I’d like to make a suggestion: In the next term paper avoid any word that is derived from Latin, avoid any legal concept that originated in the Roman Republic and avoid spelling out in name any month of the year.<br />If such an attempt isn’t sufficient to foster your understanding of human history as a continuum, I posit that the ideas of education (Latin educere: to raise up) and university (Latin universitas: the whole) may be unsuitable for you.<br />Don’t abuse the inheritance of your freedom to bully others but instead use your freedom to reflect upon yourselves. Consider that without Western civilization, without liberty—which this great republic has guarded and treasured for nearly a quarter of a millennium—there would not be a Brown University.<br />Rainer Schildknecht<br />Winnetka, Ill."
