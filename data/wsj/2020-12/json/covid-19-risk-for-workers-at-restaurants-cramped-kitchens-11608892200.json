    "body": "Many restaurants are struggling with a simple fact—there often is no easy way to make their kitchens entirely safe.<br />During the coronavirus pandemic, restaurant operators installed dividers and cut back staff to help with distancing among workers. They changed the workflow to minimize contact.<br />Still, some workers, infectious-disease experts and local health officials say it can be difficult to avoid cramped and crowded kitchen conditions that can foster transmission of the coronavirus.<br />Masks can slip, particularly in hot environments, and get contaminated, while social distancing often isn’t practical, said Davidson Hamer, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health and School of Medicine.<br />“It only takes one person in that environment to be shedding the virus, and everyone is at a risk,” he said."
