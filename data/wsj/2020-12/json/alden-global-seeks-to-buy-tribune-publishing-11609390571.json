    "body": "A hedge fund that owns a big stake in  Tribune Publishing Co.  is seeking to buy the newspaper chain behind titles including the Chicago Tribune and New York Daily News.<br />Alden Global Capital LLC, which is already Tribune’s largest shareholder with a 32% stake, has expressed interest in acquiring the shares of the publishing company it doesn’t own already for $14.25 a share, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The offer was made Dec. 14.<br />The Wall Street Journal first reported Alden’s plans late Wednesday.<br />Tribune has a market value of roughly $470 million after a yearslong slide as the prospects for local newspapers dim. Its shares are little changed this year and were up 8.8% premarket on low volume.<br />A deal would have far-reaching implications for an industry beset by sharp declines in revenue over the past 20 years that have led to a wave of consolidation and cost cuts. Between 2008 and 2019, the industry shed 51% of its newsroom jobs, according to the Pew Research Center."
