    "body": "Super Saturday wasn’t so super for bricks-and-mortar stores, and the U.S. Postal Service is starting to buckle under the flood of holiday orders that shifted online.<br />The Saturday before Christmas is usually one of the busiest of the holiday season, as last-minute shoppers rush to stores. But with Covid-19 cases mounting and several states tightening restrictions, many people chose to stay home and shop online as they did on Black Friday, according to shopper data.<br />Foot traffic to physical stores fell 39.1% on Super Saturday and was down nearly 40% for the entire weekend, compared with the same days last year, according to Sensormatic Solutions, which has cameras and software used to track visits to thousands of malls and shopping centers.<br />“Super Saturday weekend was perceived to be the beginning of a return to brick-and-mortar due to concerns over online shipping cutoffs,” said Brian Field, senior director of Sensormatic’s global retail consulting practice. “However, many consumers elected to stay home.”<br />Sensormatic lowered its holiday foot-traffic forecast to a decline of 34% to 36% for the six weeks ending Jan. 2, from a previous estimate of down 22% to 25%. It still expects bricks-and-mortar stores to be busy in the final days before Christmas."
