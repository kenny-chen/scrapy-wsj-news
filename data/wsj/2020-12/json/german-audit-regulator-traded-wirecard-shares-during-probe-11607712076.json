    "body": "The head of a top Germany regulator traded shares of  Wirecard AG  while he oversaw a probe of the company’s auditor, raising fresh questions about Germany’s handling of one of its biggest corporate scandals.<br />Ralf Bose, the head of Apas, a German government agency that oversees auditors, said during a parliamentary hearing into the Wirecard scandal held late Thursday that he bought shares of Wirecard in April—a few months before the company’s collapse—and sold them the following month.<br />This is the second time a German regulator disclosed that staff traded Wirecard shares while the payment-services company was being investigated. BaFin, Germany’s stock-market regulator, said in August that it had allowed its staff to trade Wirecard shares while it was investigating the company. It has since banned most of its staff from trading shares and other securities from financial companies.<br />A BaFin spokeswoman said the regulator is looking into Mr. Bose’s trades. Germany’s economy minister said the government would open a probe.<br />Mr. Bose couldn’t be reached for comment. A spokesman for Apas didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
