    "body": "Jane Mayerwriting for the New Yorker, Dec. 10:<br /><br />According to several sources, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Minority Leader, was so worried that [Dianne] Feinstein would mismanage [Amy Coney] Barrett’s confirmation hearings that he installed a trusted former aide, Max Young, to “embed” in the Judiciary Committee to make sure the hearings didn’t go off the rails. . . . The precaution nonetheless failed. . . . The Democrats sought to fire up their voters by highlighting the illegitimacy of the process. But, to the Democrats’ dismay, Feinstein instead hugged the Republican chairman of the committee, Lindsey Graham, thanking him for his “fairness” and for running “one of the best set of hearings that I’ve participated in.”"
