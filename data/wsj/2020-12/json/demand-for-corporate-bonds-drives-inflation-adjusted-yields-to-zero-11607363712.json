    "body": "The average U.S. investment-grade corporate bond now yields less than a key measure of investors’ inflation expectations, a first that highlights how demand for fixed-income assets is reducing their potential returns.<br />As of Friday, the annual expected inflation rate over the next decade—derived from the difference in yield between nominal and inflation-adjusted 10-year U.S. government bonds—stood at 1.89%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The average investment-grade corporate bond yielded just 1.85%, according to Bloomberg Barclays data.<br />So-called real yields—or the return investors can expect on bonds after adjusting for inflation—have been below zero for months on U.S. government debt. But last week marked the first time in records going back to 2003 that the phenomenon ever extended to a broad index of corporate bonds.<br />The two situations are related; negative real yields on U.S. Treasurys drive investors to buy riskier assets in search of better returns. Many have turned to corporate bonds, driving yields to new lows in recent months, investors and analysts say.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury inflation protected security—a proxy for real Treasury yields—is currently around minus-0.97%. That means investors can still pick up a meaningful amount of return by buying corporate bonds."
