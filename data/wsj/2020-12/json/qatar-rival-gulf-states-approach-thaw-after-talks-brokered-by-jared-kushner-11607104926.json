    "body": "Saudi Arabia and Qatar have reached a tentative deal to end a yearslong feud that has fractured the Middle East, paving the way for broader regional talks that could cool tensions between longstanding Gulf rivals by year’s end, U.S. and Gulf officials said Friday.<br />But Gulf officials warned that the initiative could still falter if other countries—Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt—can’t agree on how to resolve a three-year-old attempt to isolate Qatar.<br />Middle East leaders said Friday they were starting new talks, with the ruling emir of Kuwait—which is helping to mediate—expressing satisfaction with progress towards ultimate resolution of the conflict.<br />Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah praised “continuous and constructive efforts made recently to reach a final agreement to resolve a dispute that arose between brothers” and thanked President Trump for his support, according to Kuwait’s state news agency.<br />The signs of progress followed several days of intense U.S.-brokered talks. Jared Kushner, who is Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, and his team flew to Saudi Arabia and Qatar earlier this week in an effort to break an impasse in talks that has thwarted a deal for years."
