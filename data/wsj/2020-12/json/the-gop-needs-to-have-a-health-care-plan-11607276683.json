    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Can Republicans Regroup on Health Care?” (Nov. 30): That the party needs to address its biggest policy vulnerability correctly underscores the need of a more competitive health-care system but you miss the most important problem: Most health-care-provider markets in the U.S. are highly concentrated.<br />There is now overwhelming academic research that concludes the rise in prices charged by hospitals and doctors is due to reduced competition and not increased volume or quality. California data provide an example. Between 2008 and 2018 the volume of hospital care purchased by commercial insurers declined by 15% while their payments (and prices) to hospitals increased by 283%. Much of this increase is due to the growing power of large systems. In many markets across the U.S., insurance companies have no choice but to contract with dominant health systems—at above-market rates—to offer health plans that meet network adequacy requirements demanded by regulators and employers.<br />We need limited but targeted regulations to restore competition to provider markets if the GOP model of limited government control can work. Otherwise the public, which doesn’t currently support a government-run system, will see no other option.<br />Prof. Glenn Melnick<br />University of Southern California"
