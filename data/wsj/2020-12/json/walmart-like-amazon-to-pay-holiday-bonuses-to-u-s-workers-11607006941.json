The company said the Christmas Eve bonuses will cost $388 million. Walmart also paid $319 million in regular quarterly bonuses on Nov. 24, which the company has long paid employees based on store performance.<br />Walmart has reported strong sales and profit figures in recent quarters as shoppers flock to stores offering food, one-stop shopping and online-order pickup. Including typical quarterly bonuses, Walmart said it has paid more than $2.8 billion in cash bonuses this year.<br />The company said about 1.5 million workers would get the latest bonuses, including staff at Walmart stores and distribution centers and its Sam’s Club warehouse chain.
