    "body": "Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) speaking on the Senate floor Dec. 21:<br /><br />Republicans like to mock Modern Monetary Theory—the idea that government can print money with impunity, that government can spend whatever it wants without the need to tax. Modern Monetary Theory is basically the Dick Cheney “deficits don’t matter” crowd trussed up with a new fancy title.<br />Most Republican rightly lampoon this quackery—that is, when they’re not practicing the quackery themselves. Today many of these same Republicans will vote for a bill that makes Modern Monetary Theory look like child’s play in comparison.<br />The monstrous spending bill presented today is not just a “deficits don’t matter” disaster; it is everything Republicans say they don’t believe in."
