    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden asked for approval of a congressional waiver allowing him to nominate Lloyd Austin for defense secretary, which would the retired Army general the nation’s first Black Pentagon chief.<br />Mr. Biden’s request on Wednesday—which would allow Gen. Austin to serve as defense secretary even though he has been retired from the military for fewer than the seven years required under law—came amid concern that the appointment would erode civilian control of the armed forces.<br />Speaking alongside Gen. Austin from his transition headquarters in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden described his selection as someone with whom he had personally worked while vice president, and praised his career as one of the Army’s few Black four-star generals.<br />“It’s not a post he sought. But I sought him,” Mr. Biden said.<br />Addressing the waiver issue, Mr. Biden said, “I would not be asking for this exception if I didn’t believe this moment in history calls for it.”"
