    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Trump administration banned imports of cotton products from China’s Xinjiang region, saying evidence suggests the products are made with the forced labor of Uighurs.<br />The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials would start detaining shipments containing cotton and cotton products originating from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a state-owned paramilitary organization known as XPCC.<br />U.S. and other Western governments have criticized Beijing for human-rights abuses of the Uighurs, who are mostly Muslims.<br />The Chinese embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />Beijing has denied allegations of the abuse of the Uighurs. “So-called ‘human rights abuses’ in Xinjiang or ‘persecution of ethnic minorities’ are centenary lies made by extremist anti-China forces,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said during a press briefing Wednesday."
