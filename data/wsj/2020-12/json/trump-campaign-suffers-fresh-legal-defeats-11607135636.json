    "body": "President Trump’s campaign suffered more legal setbacks in his bid to reverse the November election results and filed a new challenge to the outcome in Georgia.<br />A flurry of court rulings and legal action across six battleground states came Friday as looming federal deadlines could close off Mr. Trump’s ability to further contest President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Mr. Trump has refused to concede the race, but his legal team has so far been unsuccessful at nearly every turn.<br />On Friday, a Nevada state court dismissed a Republican-backed lawsuit filed in Carson City that claimed the election was beset by irregularities and fraud. The suit asked the court either to declare Mr. Trump the winner or void the results.<br />“Contestants did not prove under any standard of proof that any of Nevada’s election officials committed malfeasance,” said the 35-page ruling by Nevada District Court Judge James T. Russell.<br />Nevada certified election results on Nov. 24, showing Mr. Biden won the state by more than 33,000 votes."
