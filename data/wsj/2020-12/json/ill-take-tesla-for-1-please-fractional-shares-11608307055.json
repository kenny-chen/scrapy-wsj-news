    "body": "Stocks are near record highs, but they’re finally getting cheaper to buy.<br />No longer do investors need to buy a minimum of 100 shares at a time or even one full share, often at prohibitive cost. Fractional-share trading enables you to purchase a sliver of a share with as little as $1, putting a stake in single stocks within anyone’s reach. As with any technology, whether that’s good or bad depends on how you use it.<br />After a decadelong bull market, buying the average stock has never required more capital. Seven companies in the S&P 500 have share prices above $1,000, including Google’s parent  Alphabet Inc.,   Amazon.com Inc.,  AutoZone Inc. and  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.   Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s  Class A stock costs more than $330,000 per share.<br />Let’s say you want to invest in  Tesla Inc.,  which joins the S&P 500 next week. But you can’t spare nearly $70,000 to buy 100 shares—or even almost $700 to buy one. At several leading brokerage firms, you can put up $5 or less and buy about 1/120th of a share, commission-free.<br />Earlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules redefining a “round lot,” which has long been 100 shares. From now on, it will consist of 100 shares only for stocks priced up to $250. At higher prices, the size of a round lot drops to 40 shares, then 10. Above $10,000, a single share will constitute a round lot."
