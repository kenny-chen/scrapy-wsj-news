    "body": "The Lebanese judge leading an investigation into the massive explosion at Beirut’s port charged the caretaker prime minister and three former ministers with negligence that resulted in the destruction of a swath of the capital and nearly 200 deaths in August.<br />Thursday’s indictment represents the first significant step in a probe that has so far failed to provide accountability for one of the biggest nonnuclear explosions in history. But critics say it unfairly assigns blame for a disaster many see as the culmination of years of bad governance by the entire ruling elite rather than one individual.<br />Judge Fadi Sawan is set to question Prime Minister Hassan Diab on Monday, according to the Lebanese state news agency NNA. Former Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil and two former ministers of Public Works, Ghazi Zeaiter and Youssef Finianos, were also charged and will be interrogated next week.<br />The Prime Minister’s office responded saying Mr. Diab’s conscience was clear. “He is confident that his hands are clean and that he has handled the Beirut Port blast file in a responsible and transparent manner,” it said.<br />Protests forced Mr. Diab to resign in the wake of the explosion on Aug. 4, but he is still serving in a caretaker capacity because the political class has failed to agree on a new cabinet."
