    "body": "KATHMANDU, Nepal—How tall is Mount Everest? Until now, it depended on whom you asked. China said it was 29,017 feet. Nepal said it was a little taller, at 29,028 feet.<br />The countries have closed that 11-foot gap and reached an agreement.<br />The world’s tallest peak this week will get a new, unified official height from the two nations it straddles. After yearslong surveys, China and Nepal will announce the peak’s stature Tuesday, Susheel Dangol, the man in charge of Nepal’s Everest-measurement project, said Sunday.<br />“The challenge for us was to prove we could do it,” he said.<br />Measuring Everest has always been a challenge, taxing the latest surveying technology since the 1800s. And it created a disagreement between the mountain’s two homelands."
