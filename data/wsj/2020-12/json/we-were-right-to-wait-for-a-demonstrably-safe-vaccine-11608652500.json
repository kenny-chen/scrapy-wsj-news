    "body": "Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. has done a phenomenal job critiquing the media’s avoidance of Covid-19’s actual mortality rate. And reading his column “Vaccines vs. Lockdowns” (Business World, Dec. 16), it was refreshing to see someone argue that the vaccine development was too slow instead of too rushed.<br />Nevertheless, we should all be thankful that corners weren’t cut in the making of the vaccine. Mr. Jenkins states that the vaccine was developed in January. Although the composition of the vaccine was known by then, the proper dosage and schedule for administration weren’t determined until Phase Two was analyzed over the summer.<br />Patience in waiting for the most rapidly developed vaccine in history has yielded several safe options, more effective than many of our current vaccines, including for measles. I am happy to recommend it confidently to my patients, and I am happy that corners weren’t cut—denying anti-vaxxers ammunition in their campaign against our best weapon to fight infectious disease.<br />Paul Bower, M.D.<br />Port St. Lucie, Fla."
