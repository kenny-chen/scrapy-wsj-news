    "body": "European Union member states formally backed last week’s trade deal between the U.K. and the EU setting out post-Brexit trade, security and economic ties.<br />The agreement, which will be signed by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU’s top two officials on Wednesday, will come into effect provisionally on Jan. 1, pending the European Parliament’s vote on the accord in early 2021. The U.K. Parliament is expected to approve the agreement on Wednesday.<br />Approval had been widely expected following the agreement announced between the two sides on Christmas Eve. Negotiations lasted through most of 2020.<br />Formal approval by U.K. lawmakers is likely to be a formality, given Mr. Johnson’s majority in the House of Commons and the expected support from most lawmakers from the main opposition Labour Party.<br />Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com"
