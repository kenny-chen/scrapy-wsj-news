His wife, Karen Pence, and Surgeon General Jerome Adams will also get the shot in what the White House said was an effort to “promote the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and build confidence among the American people.”<br />Mr. Biden has said he would follow the recommendations of Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.<br />The president-elect has emphasized the importance of helping the public tackle any skepticism of the vaccine. He told reporters Wednesday, “I don’t want to get ahead of the line but I want to make sure we demonstrate to the American people that it’s safe to take.”<br />Two Biden transition officials said Mr. Biden would receive the injection as soon as next week. The officials said Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would get vaccinated soon and, like Mr. Biden, in public. No specific details have yet been announced."
