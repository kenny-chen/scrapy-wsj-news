    "body": "SÃO PAULO—The election of Joe Biden as U.S. president will raise pressure on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to step up the country’s effort to curb growing deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.<br />Deforestation in the Amazon has accelerated under the Brazilian leader—in part, environmentalists say, because his calls for economic development in the jungle have emboldened land grabbers, illegal ranchers and wildcat miners. The former army officer once nicknamed himself “Captain Chainsaw.”<br />Official data released last week showed deforestation at a 12-year high. About 4,300 square miles of forest, more than three quarters the size of Connecticut, were lost in the 12 months to July this year—up 9.5% from the same period a year earlier, according to satellite data from Brazil’s space agency, Inpe.<br />The rising deforestation has led to growing pressure at home and abroad on the Brazilian nationalist. France has cited deforestation as a reason for holding up passage of a large trade deal between the European Union and Mercosur, the South American bloc, of which Brazil is the biggest member.<br />British supermarkets have already threatened to boycott Brazil’s products, while apparel and footwear company  VF Corp. —owner of Timberland, Vans and the North Face—stopped using Brazilian leather last year in protest over destruction of the Amazon."
