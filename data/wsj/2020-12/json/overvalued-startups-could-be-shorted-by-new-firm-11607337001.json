    "body": "Venture investors often bid up prices on hot startup deals with little regard for the price they’re paying. Sometimes these companies live up to the hype. But not always.<br />Enter Apeira Capital.<br />The New York firm is aiming to bring a hedge-fund form of long-short investing to venture-backed startups. It will invest about 70% of its money in the long portion of its fund, making traditional venture investments by buying early-stage Series A through C equity.<br />With the remaining portion, Apeira plans to create “venture synthetics” that mimic the price performance of individual startups’ equity to do the equivalent of shorting companies’ stock. In essence, the firm is creating one-off bets with other parties on the fate of individual startups.<br />The firm is raising $150 million for its first fund, according to a person familiar with the situation. The firm didn’t say when the fund would officially launch."
