    "body": "Activision Blizzard Inc.  is suing  Netflix Inc.  for allegedly poaching its former finance chief and causing competitive harm, citing a pattern of behavior by the streaming giant.<br />In a complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Friday, the videogame publishing company said Netflix illegally recruited Spencer Neumann in late 2018, prompting a contract breach that disrupted business operations. Activision said the move also cost it business opportunities as well as millions of dollars paid out to retain other executives.<br />Mr. Neumann, who previously held roles at the  Walt Disney Co.  and private-equity firms, joined Activision as its finance chief in May 2017. The employment contract initially carried a three-year term.<br />“Netflix has a demonstrated pattern of caring only about attracting and employing whoever Netflix wants, regardless of whether it violates the law along the way,” the suit claims.<br />A spokesman for Netflix declined to comment on the lawsuit."
