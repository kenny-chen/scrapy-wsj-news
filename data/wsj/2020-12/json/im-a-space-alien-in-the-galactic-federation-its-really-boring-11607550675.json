    "body": "Former Israeli Space Security Chief Says Aliens Exist, Humanity Not Ready<br />This ‘Galactic Federation’ has supposedly been in contact with Israel and the U.S. for years, but are keeping themselves a secret to prevent hysteria until humanity is ready.<br />—Headline from the Jerusalem Post, Dec. 8<br /><br />Earthlings finally heard the big “news” about our Galactic Federation, and I get why they’re excited. Humans see “Galactic Federation,” and they think of all the space movies they’ve seen—star fleets, laser battles, “Men in Black,” “E.T.,” Richard Dreyfuss making Devil’s Tower with mashed potatoes, John Williams’s “Imperial March,” BAH, BAH, BAH, Bup-beh BAH, all that."
