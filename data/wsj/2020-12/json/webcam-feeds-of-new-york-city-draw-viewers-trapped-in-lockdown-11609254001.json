    "body": "When streaming video service VUit launched in September, the coronavirus upended its plans to broadcast live shows from its Manhattan studio. On a whim, employees turned the studio’s camera out the window to face the nondescript corner of Sixth Avenue and 39th Street. The 24-hour street-scene feed quickly became the service’s most popular channel, beating out dozens of live news and sports broadcasts.<br />Last week, I watched the online feed with Jack Perry, the CEO and founder of VUit’s parent company, Syncbak, and asked him to narrate the action.<br />“There goes three shoppers,” he said, as several pedestrians traversed the crosswalk.<br />A few moments passed.<br />“Look, someone’s carrying their  Starbucks .  And there’s a  FedEx  truck,” he said. “That’s the second time it’s come around.”"
