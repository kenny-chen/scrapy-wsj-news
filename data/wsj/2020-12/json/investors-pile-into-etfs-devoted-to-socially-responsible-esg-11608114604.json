    "body": "Money is pouring into exchange-traded funds that bill themselves as socially conscious.<br />This year investors have put a record $27.4 billion into ETFs traded in U.S. markets that say they focus on environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, practices, according to data from FactSet, doubling the size of the sector.<br />The surge suggests ESG investing has staying power, answering those who had questioned whether investors would give priority to goals such as promoting clean energy over simply picking the best-performing stocks regardless of companies’ principles. Expectations for new legislation aimed at combating climate change under a Biden administration are likely to stoke demand for ESG funds over the coming years, and several asset managers are rushing to meet that demand.<br />Asset managers have launched 31 ESG-related ETFs so far this year, nearly double last year’s sum and bringing the total number of products in the U.S. to more than 100, according to Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research at FactSet.<br />BlackRock Inc.  has been among the most prolific, recently rolling out ETFs that are based on the S&P 500 and other indexes but exclude companies involved in the fossil-fuel, tobacco and weapons industries. Other asset managers, including Gabelli Funds, plan to introduce additional funds."
