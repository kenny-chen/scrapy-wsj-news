    "body": "Even as more Americans get Covid-19 vaccinations, diagnostic manufacturers, employers and public-health authorities are pushing to expand testing for the virus over the next several months to help curb its still-surging spread.<br />The goal is that more-frequent testing, along with other mitigation measures such as mask wearing and social distancing, can get people back into classrooms and workplaces before the wider availability of vaccines.<br />“While we’re in the process of immunizing the American people, we must keep our guard up,” Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, who oversees Covid-19 testing, said at a media briefing last week. “You can expect more at-home and screening testing, like before you go to work, before you travel.”<br />Some large employers, including companies such as  Netflix Inc.,  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  recently started expanding testing for workers, looking to screen people without symptoms. Last week, Google started offering weekly testing for its 90,000 U.S. employees, and airlines and tourist organizations are hoping that testing will get people back in the air.<br />The U.S. will likely be able to perform more than 70 million Covid-19 tests a week by the end of January, according to recent estimates from the Rockefeller Foundation. By April, that is expected to grow to 200 million weekly tests. The growth will be driven by tests done outside laboratories, including in schools and doctors’ offices, and those processed at home. Increasing the number of patient samples analyzed in a single test, a technique known as pooling, will also likely contribute, the foundation said."
