    "body": "Pharmaceutical companies and health officials are homing in on a key sector of the population that has been largely left out of planning for Covid-19 vaccines: children.<br />Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  whose jointly developed vaccine is now being rolled out in the U.K., became the first Covid-19 vaccine developers to include children in U.S. trials in September.  Moderna Inc.,  whose vaccine has also shown to be effective in adults, said Thursday it began a trial for children 12 to 17 years old.  AstraZeneca  PLC also plans a U.S. trial for children.<br />The omission of children in U.S. vaccine trials so far worries public-health experts, who say they don’t know whether the vaccines are safe for children or need changes to dosage levels. While children are less likely than adults to fall gravely ill or die because of Covid-19, researchers say, vaccinating them will help prevent the spread of the virus and achieve herd immunity.<br />Yet some experts don’t expect a children’s vaccine will be ready by the 2021 school year because of how long trials take, even on the accelerated timeline for Covid-19 vaccines. “I’m pretty worried that the window’s closing if it hasn’t already closed,” said Evan Anderson, a pediatrics professor at the Emory University School of Medicine. “The timing then becomes a challenge in order to achieve enough data such that you’ve had a vaccine fully tested and evaluated over the spring and summer.”<br />The American Academy of Pediatrics recently sent a letter to federal officials urging children to be included in clinical studies. In the letter, AAP noted that more than two-thirds of the children who died from Covid-19 infections were Black or Latino."
