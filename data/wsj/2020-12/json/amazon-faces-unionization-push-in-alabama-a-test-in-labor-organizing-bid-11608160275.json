    "body": "Amazon.com Inc .  workers at an Alabama warehouse received approval to hold a unionization vote, the first such election since 2014 at the nation’s second-largest employer, testing the potential for additional labor organizing at the retailing giant.<br />The National Labor Relations Board Tuesday ruled that employees at Amazon’s Bessemer, Ala., warehouse can decide whether to create a bargaining unit within the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, according to an NLRB official. The date of the election and other terms have yet to be determined. A hearing about the vote is scheduled for Friday.<br />A majority of the workers would have to choose unionization for the employees to gain representation. The Alabama warehouse has about 1,500 full- and part-time employees, according to the union, although Amazon has said the total is higher.<br />Though many hurdles remain, labor experts say a successful campaign by workers could inspire similar efforts at other Amazon warehouses. The company has more than 800,000 U.S. employees, second only to  Walmart Inc .  in the country, as well as more than 760 facilities in its fulfillment network, according to logistics consultant MWPVL International.<br />An Amazon spokeswoman said the company didn’t believe “this group represents the majority of our employees’ views. Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available.”"
