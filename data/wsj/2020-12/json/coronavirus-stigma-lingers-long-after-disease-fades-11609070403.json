    "body": "TOKYO—Shuichi Takatori spent two weeks in the hospital this fall with a fever after catching Covid-19. He recovered, went back to work and now feels fine.<br />But the disease lingered on in a different way—in the stigma Mr. Takatori says he felt from society. The 60-year-old member of Japan’s Parliament decided to disclose his illness, although he said he feared the consequences in next year’s election, and word quickly got around.<br />A restaurant where had dined called his office to ask for damages. The school basketball team of an aide’s child was disinvited from a tournament. And weeks after his recovery, he says relatives told him not to visit his hometown for a service on the first anniversary of his father’s death.<br />“I feel even now like it’s something embarrassing,” said Mr. Takatori, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.<br />Doctors say the shunning doesn’t make much medical sense, because people who have recovered from Covid-19 are typically no longer infectious. And public-health specialists say turning every infection into a moral failure—which is apt to be unfair, since the path of the virus is so random—can make the epidemic harder to control. For his part, Mr. Takatori said he was taking precautions and has no idea why he got sick."
