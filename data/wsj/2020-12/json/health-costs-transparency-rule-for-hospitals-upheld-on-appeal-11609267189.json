    "body": "WASHINGTON—A federal appeals court in Washington affirmed a Trump administration policy requiring hospitals to disclose secret rates they negotiate with insurance companies beginning on Friday, marking a victory for one of President Trump’s central health-policy initiatives.<br />The American Hospital Association had sued to stop the initiative from taking effect. But in June, a federal judge in the District of Columbia ruled that the new rules were legal.<br />The hospital trade group appealed, arguing that the rule compelling the hospitals to publish their negotiated rates with insurers violated the First Amendment and went beyond the statutory intent of the Affordable Care Act.<br />On Tuesday, a panel for the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia unanimously upheld the district court’s ruling.<br />The decision not only “fits comfortably within existing First Amendment precedent,” but also is “not intended to expand existing First Amendment doctrine or to otherwise affect traditional or ordinary economic regulation of commercial activity,” they wrote."
