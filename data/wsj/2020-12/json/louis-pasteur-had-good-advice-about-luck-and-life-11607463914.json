    "body": "Bob Brody’s “It’s Thanksgiving, as Luck Would Have It” (op-ed, Nov. 25) rightly suggests we should appreciate our good luck when good things come our way. He notes that attitudes and behavior can influence our luck, possibly steering us away from bad luck. His piece reminded me of one of my favorite ironic quotes, attributed to Louis Pasteur: “Chance only favors the mind which is prepared.”<br />Charles Piper<br />Lake Oswego, Ore."
