    "body": "WASHINGTON—A Republican senator said he would object to the results of the presidential election when Congress holds a joint session next week to certify Democrat Joe Biden as the winner, a move that would force lawmakers to vote to affirm the states’ tallies but has no chance of overturning the outcome.<br />“Millions of voters concerned about election integrity deserve to be heard,” tweeted Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. “I will object on January 6 on their behalf.”<br />President Trump has blamed voter fraud for his defeat in the November election, but no significant evidence emerged that would challenge the result. Recently departed Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department hadn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud that could reverse Mr. Biden’s election victory.<br />The Trump campaign has continued to try to challenge the results in court, and on Tuesday it asked the Supreme Court to overturn Mr. Biden’s victory in Wisconsin.<br />Federal law requires Congress to count and certify the results of each state’s electoral vote in a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, but lawmakers can raise objections. It takes one member of the House and one senator to formally object and force debate and votes in both chambers."
