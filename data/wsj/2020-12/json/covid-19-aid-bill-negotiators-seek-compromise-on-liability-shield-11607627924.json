    "body": "WASHINGTON—Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the need for liability protections that Republicans have sought in negotiations over the next coronavirus relief package, as the hunt for a compromise continued in the Capitol.<br />A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate had wrapped up an agreement on much of a $908 billion package of emergency coronavirus relief on Thursday, but were still haggling over the biggest sticking point: how to structure legal protections for businesses, schools and other entities operating during the pandemic.<br />Lawmakers led by Sen. Angus King (I., Maine) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) were working on hammering out a deal on some form of limited protections, but it wasn’t clear how much GOP support their idea would draw, aides said.<br />For weeks, lawmakers have operated under the principle that any relief package would need to include some form of liability protections, long a top priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), as well as additional funding for state and local governments, a key condition of Democrats.<br />That pairing came into question this week. First, Mr. McConnell suggested dropping both measures from this package. Democrats rejected that tradeoff, arguing that liability protection wasn’t as urgent as aid to states and localities whose revenues have been hammered by the pandemic."
