    "body": "PARIS—The government of President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday proposed legislation to outlaw a broad array of activity that it defines as forms of “Islamist separatism,” from the abuse of home schooling to online hate speech.<br />Authorities have framed the legislation, which will be debated by parliament in January, as a response to the spread of radical Islamism, an ideology that the government says aims to build a parallel society where religious rules override civil ones.<br />That ideology, officials say, undermines the values of the French Republic and its principle of laïcité, which separates religion and the state.<br />“The Republic intends to defend itself,” Prime Minister Jean Castex said at a news conference Wednesday.<br />The bill, which comes after several terrorist attacks this year, risks escalating tensions between Muslim groups in France and authorities who enforce the country’s strict secularism."
