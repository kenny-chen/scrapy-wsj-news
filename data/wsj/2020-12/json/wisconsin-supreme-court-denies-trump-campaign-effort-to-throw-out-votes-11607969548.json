    "body": "A divided Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected a Trump campaign lawsuit seeking to reverse President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, ending the president’s last major effort to reverse the results as the Electoral College met Monday.<br />President Trump’s legal team aimed to invalidate the votes of 220,000 people, asking the court to throw out four broad categories of ballots, including those cast by voters who self-certified as “indefinitely confined.”<br />In a 4-3 vote Monday, the court called the challenge to indefinitely confined voters “meritless on its face,” and ruled that the other challenges were brought too late. Trump lawyers could have filed them before the election, the court said.<br />“At the end of the day, nothing in this case casts any legitimate doubt that the people of Wisconsin lawfully chose Vice President Biden and Senator Harris to be the next leaders of our great country,” wrote Justice Brian Hagedorn, who was legal counsel to former Republican Gov. Scott Walker.<br />Mr. Biden won Wisconsin by 20,000 votes, and the state awarded him its 10 Electoral College votes on Monday."
