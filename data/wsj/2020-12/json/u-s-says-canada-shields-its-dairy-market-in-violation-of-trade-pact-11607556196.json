    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Trump administration filed a complaint against Canada over the market access for U.S. dairy products, in the first enforcement action under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.<br />U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Wednesday that Canada has hampered the ability of American dairy farmers and producers to sell their products, by using quotas that prefer Canadian producers.<br />In a letter to his Canadian counterpart, Mr. Lighthizer said the U.S. was exercising its rights to enforce the USMCA, adding that Washington may request the establishment of a USMCA dispute-settlement panel if the U.S.’s concerns aren’t addressed.<br />“Canada’s measures violate its commitments and harm U.S dairy farmers and producers,” Mr. Lighthizer said in a written statement. “We are disappointed that Canada’s policies have made this first ever enforcement action under the USMCA necessary to ensure compliance with the agreement.”<br />A spokeswoman for Mary Ng, Canada’s minister of small business, export promotion and international trade, said her country was “in full compliance with its commitments” under the USMCA."
