    "body": "BERLIN— Volkswagen AG  said it would cut production in the first quarter of next year in China, Europe and North America because of a shortage of chips, the latest evidence that chip production is straining to meet demand after pandemic-related cuts earlier this year.<br />Global businesses have struggled to keep pace with the multispeed economic recovery across regions and industries as parts of the world slowly emerge from the pandemic, presaging what could be uneven growth next year with the potential for short-term setbacks.<br />China’s strong recovery since the summer has been a lifeline to Western auto makers with exposure to the world’s biggest car market. Yet it has also created unexpectedly strong demand for chips that semiconductor makers have had trouble meeting, after driving down stocks in the spring.<br />Now shortages that were first observed in Chinese factories have spread to the rest of the world, and car manufacturers are beginning to respond by cutting production, which could cause ripples throughout the global economy.<br />“We came through the crisis well thanks to excellent management of production and materials purchasing,” said Murat Aksel, who takes over as a Volkswagen board member in charge of procurement in January. “But now we are beginning to feel the effects of the global shortage in semiconductors.”"
