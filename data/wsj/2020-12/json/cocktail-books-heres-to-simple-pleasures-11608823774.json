    "body": "Last December a group of cocktail virtuosi in Washington, D.C., put on their annual holiday cocktail seminar. The invitation promised that “DC’s finest bartenders” would present original holiday cocktails. “They’ll tell the story of what inspired the drink, and show you how to make the drink at home,” the promoters said. “And best of all, they’ll serve it to you!”<br />That was so 2019.<br />The advertisement for this year’s event was a little different. “Cocktails will be batched and placed into plastic pouches, which may be collected” to go. For $50, virtual attendees were promised “6 pre-mixed cocktails . . . just bring them home and enjoy!” There was a caveat: “Some drinks might involve shaking, heating, or other final preparation.”<br />Such has been the effect of lockdowns on the bougie world of high-end mixed drinks. A year ago a craft cocktail meant an elaborate concoction painstakingly constructed and extravagantly presented. Now it’s a premixed drink in a plastic bag. À votre santé.<br />The irony is that the artisanal-cocktail movement was born, in no small part, out of a rejection of prefab drinks. Dale DeGroff, a bartender and pioneer in the craft-cocktail movement, penned a 2002 book titled, appropriately, “The Craft of the Cocktail.” An authoritative mix of recipes and techniques with a dash of anecdotes, the collection helped reintroduce a thirsty public to whole categories of forgotten drinks, such as cobblers."
