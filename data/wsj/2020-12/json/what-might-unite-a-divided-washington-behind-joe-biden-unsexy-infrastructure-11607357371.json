    "body": "Imagine you are President-elect Joe Biden, and you’re looking at a political hot mess when you take office.<br />The outgoing president is seeking to undermine the legitimacy of your administration. You won’t even know which party controls the Senate until after two January runoff elections in Georgia. No matter how those races turn out, Congress is almost evenly divided between two incessantly bickering parties, and your Democrats actually lost ground in the House in this year’s election.<br />Is there any issue—any initiative—you could turn to with hope it might bring together the disparate pieces of this fractured system?<br />One word: Infrastructure.<br />Yes, unsexy infrastructure. Roads, bridges, airports, subways, broadband networks, windmills, solar farms. Infrastructure just might be the vehicle that could smash through the political roadblocks in Washington, and perhaps demonstrate that, yes, things can get done. It isn’t dramatic, but maybe we’ve all had enough drama for a while."
