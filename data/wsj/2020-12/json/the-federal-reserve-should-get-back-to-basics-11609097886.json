    "body": "Sen. Pat Toomey is right to insist that any Covid relief bill include language terminating the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending facilities by the end of this year (“Hijacking the Fed to Bail Out States,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 18). These facilities go well beyond the provision of liquidity and threaten to further erode the Fed’s independence.<br />The emergency facilities constitute fiscal policy, which is properly the domain of Congress, and there is no evidence that the facilities helped the Fed meet the increased demand for liquidity brought on by the pandemic. The Fed’s job is hard enough without demanding that it also lend directly to small businesses, corporations and state governments. Congress should terminate these facilities immediately so that the Fed can focus on what it does best: providing liquidity.<br />Assistant Prof. Bryan Cutsinger<br />Angelo State University<br />San Angelo, Texas"
