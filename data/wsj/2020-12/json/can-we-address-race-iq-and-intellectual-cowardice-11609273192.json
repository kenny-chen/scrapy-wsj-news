    "body": "In “An Intelligent Discussion About Race and IQ Is Possible” (Upward Mobility, Dec. 16), Jason Riley is right to highlight the work of James Flynn. The late researcher of the complex genetic and environmental factors relating to intelligence believed, as Mr. Riley puts it, that “dodging difficult topics was intellectual cowardice.” That brings to mind cancel culture, the apotheosis of intellectual cowardice. Does the need to shut down discussion, out of fear or plain rage, have its roots in genetic or environmental factors? We should study that, too.<br />Tom O’Hare<br />Charlestown, R.I.<br /><br />Mr. Riley quotes Flynn’s remark: “To advise scholars that they should not systemically investigate race and IQ seems to me to raise the question of what we are afraid of.” The Trump era has provided a bit of clarity on how one might begin to answer that. We aren’t afraid of the evidence or the truth about racial differences. We are afraid of individuals who wield great power and demonstrate little appreciation of the finer points. Do we need to go public with findings that we know will be used to substantiate distorted conclusions?"
