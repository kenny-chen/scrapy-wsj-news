    "body": "Israelis are traveling in droves to the United Arab Emirates for work and pleasure, filling up the first-ever direct commercial flights between the two countries in pursuit of new opportunities in the Persian Gulf despite heightened tensions in the region.<br />The U.A.E. hosts a fairly large Iranian population and has regular direct flights from Iran, raising Israeli concerns that its citizens could be targeted by Tehran there in the wake of the killing of a top Iranian scientist last month.<br />Iran has blamed Israel for the Nov. 27 killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, considered the father of the country’s nuclear program, and has vowed revenge.<br />Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied its involvement. It urged its citizens to stay vigilant and avoid crowded public areas in the U.A.E., citing the threat of Iranian attacks.<br />For now, those threats haven’t dissuaded Israeli investors such as Dorian Barak from traveling to the U.A.E."
