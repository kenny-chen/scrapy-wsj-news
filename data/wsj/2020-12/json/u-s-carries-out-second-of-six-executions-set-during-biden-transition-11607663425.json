    "body": "WASHINGTON—Brandon Bernard was executed Thursday, the second of six federal inmates scheduled to die between Election Day and Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden, who opposes capital punishment, takes office.<br />Mr. Bernard, 40 years old, received a lethal injection of pentobarbital at the federal penitentiary at Terre Haute, Ind., shortly after a divided Supreme Court declined to grant a stay of execution. He was pronounced dead at 9:27 p.m., according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.<br />The Terre Haute prison is scheduled to execute another federal inmate, Alfred Bourgeois, on Friday.<br />In 1999, at age 18, Mr. Bernard took part in a Killeen, Texas, carjacking that ended in a double murder on the grounds of Fort Hood. His attorneys argued his sentence was improper after recently disclosed evidence indicated that prosecutors withheld information allegedly casting doubt on his propensity for future violence, a factor essential to the government’s argument for the death penalty.<br />Under a landmark Supreme Court case from 1963, Brady v. Maryland, the government is obliged to turn over exculpatory evidence when the defense requests. In October, President Trump signed the bipartisan Due Process Protections Act, which requires that federal judges take steps ensuring that prosecutors comply with the 1963 precedent.  The new law didn’t apply to Mr. Bernard’s case retroactively."
