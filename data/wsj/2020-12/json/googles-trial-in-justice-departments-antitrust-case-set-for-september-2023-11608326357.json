    "body": "WASHINGTON—Government antitrust cases challenging Google’s business practices are going to be a long road in court.<br />U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said Friday it will be almost three years before a trial begins in the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit alleging Google uses a web of exclusionary agreements and other tactics to preserve a monopoly for its flagship search engine and related advertising business.<br />Judge Mehta set a tentative trial date of Sept. 12, 2023, based on a lengthy proposed schedule laid out by the parties.<br />“If anybody thought we would be getting to trial quickly, this certainly will dispel that notion,” the judge said during a telephonic hearing.<br />A group of 11 state attorneys general joined with the Justice Department in filing the lawsuit in October. Three additional states, including California, have since moved to join it."
