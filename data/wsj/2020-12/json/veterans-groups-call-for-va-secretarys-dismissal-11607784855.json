    "body": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and all of the nation’s top veterans advocacy groups called for the dismissal of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie after the department’s inspector general found he mishandled an investigation into sexual-assault allegations by a female veteran.<br />On Saturday, Mrs. Pelosi (D., Calif.), the American Legion and Vietnam Veterans of America joined a number of those calling on Mr. Wilkie to resign.<br />An inspector general report released Thursday said the secretary disparaged a veteran who said she had been assaulted at a VA hospital last year. Mr. Wilkie and top aides refused to fully cooperate with the probe and a top aide unsuccessfully tried to plant a story with a major newspaper discrediting the woman, investigators said in the report.<br />Investigators said they didn’t find that Mr. Wilkie actively tried to seek negative information about the woman. But they said they couldn’t resolve a number of discrepancies because of his and other VA officials’ lack of cooperation.<br />A spokeswoman for Mr. Wilkie said Saturday he will continue to lead the department. He said Thursday that he denied wrongdoing and the investigation was unfounded."
