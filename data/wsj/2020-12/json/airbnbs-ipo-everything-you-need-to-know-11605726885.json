    "body": "Home-sharing giant Airbnb Inc. unveiled paperwork for its initial public offering last month, moving ahead with plans to sell shares to the public in a challenging year when the travel industry buckled under the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The San Francisco-based company was founded in 2008 after Joe Gebbia got his friends Brian Chesky and Nathan Blecharczyk excited about renting an air mattress in his downtown apartment. It has grown into a global behemoth with more than 4 million hosts and over 7.4 million listings of home rentals along with “experiences” like guided wine tours, mountaintop yoga and pottery classes.<br />Here is what you need to know:<br />Airbnb is planning its market debut this week, with its shares scheduled to begin trading Dec. 10. Last week, the company said it plans to sell 50 million new shares at an offering price of $44 to $50 a share. People familiar with the matter said Sunday that the company plans to boost the proposed price range to $56 to $60 a share.<br />Airbnb set the initial price range after gauging initial demand from prospective investors. The company will continue to gauge demand from investors during the official roadshow done over video in the run-up to its IPO. On Dec. 9, working with Airbnb executives, the investment banks underwriting the offering will set the IPO price based on feedback from those conversations."
