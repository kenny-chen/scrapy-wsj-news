    "body": "Regarding David Satter’s op-ed “Soviet Politics, American Style” (Dec. 23): As a younger man serving in our military, I saw an extraordinary thing on two continents. In both Europe and Asia, the idea of a border wall was turned on its head. No longer were walls built to keep invaders out but to keep people in. I have seen governments so loathed that minefields, guard towers and canine patrols were required to keep inmates, euphemistically called citizens, from escaping their borders. At its most benign, socialism requires compulsion and control of state media. A fair telling of this ill-conceived experiment might disabuse our young of its allure.<br />Conan M. Ward<br />Princeton, N.J.<br /><br />A warning against groupthink is useful. But a warning like Mr. Satter’s, solely against groupthink on the left, is only a warning against the left styled as a defense of liberal norms. Today’s right doesn’t like dissent, either. For many Republican politicians, accepting the election result would have “ended any hope of a career,” to use Mr. Satter’s words. Talk about an “attempt to impose a deluded version of reality.” The right’s leader cultivates a personality cult and campaigns against “enemies of the people.” These are core Soviet practices."
