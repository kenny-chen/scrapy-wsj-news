    "body": "Ludwig van Beethoven was born 250 years ago and baptized Dec. 17, 1770. Even those who don’t care for classical music recognize the opening bars of his Fifth Symphony. “Ode to Joy” from his Ninth brings tears to the eyes of listeners when “flash mobs” perform it. I’m a huge Beethoven fan and have been fortunate to hear both symphonies in concert.<br />Beethoven was resilient, innovative and gritty. His prodigious creativity left an enduring mark.<br />Amid 21st-century technological progress, the evolution of the piano in the late 18th century may seem quaint. But Beethoven took full advantage of the wider frequency and amplitude ranges this new instrument provided. The fortepiano—Italian for “loud soft”—was a major improvement on the harpsichord. Because the piano uses hammers to strike strings, players for the first time could vary a note’s volume.<br />Beethoven’s life is almost as inspiring as his music. He had an abusive, alcoholic father, Johann Beethoven, who often dragged his son from bed at night to practice at the keyboard. He so wanted Ludwig to be a child prodigy that he claimed the 7-year-old boy was only 6 when he gave his first recital. Johann felt he was in competition with Leopold Mozart, father of Wolfgang.<br />Beethoven was remarkably productive: His complete works fill 80 compact discs. The maximum disc playback length is 74 minutes, just long enough to accommodate the Ninth Symphony."
