    "body": "Federal Reserve officials who gain votes on the central bank’s monetary policy committee in January include some of its strongest supporters of policies to stimulate the economy.<br />The annual rotation of Federal Open Market Committee members means the regional Fed bank presidents joining next year are Atlanta’s Raphael Bostic, Chicago’s Charles Evans, Richmond’s Thomas Barkin and San Francisco’s Mary Daly.<br />Meanwhile, the chiefs of the Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis and Philadelphia Fed banks will no longer be voting members, but will still attend FOMC meetings and participate fully in its policy deliberations.<br />The panel comprises all members of the central bank’s seven-seat Washington-based board of governors—which has one vacancy—and five of the 12 regional Fed bank presidents. Of those five, the New York Fed leader is always a voter and four voting slots rotate each year among the other presidents.<br />The shift rarely has any effect on policy, but the voters tend to command more public attention than nonvoters because their dissents are formally recorded. The nonvoters can express their objections during the meetings and through public comments, but the official dissents put a spotlight on the breadth of debate inside the central bank."
