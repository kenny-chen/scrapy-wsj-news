    "body": "A Chinese drug regulator gave provisional approval to a Covid-19 vaccine developed by a state-owned company, an official at the agency said, providing a green light for mass inoculation roughly a year after the pandemic first emerged in central China.<br />The National Medical Products Administration, the country’s top drug regulator, approved the vaccine Wednesday evening, Deputy Commissioner Chen Shifei said Thursday. A Beijing-based drug-development unit of China National Pharmaceutical Group Co., known more commonly as Sinopharm, said earlier Wednesday that its shot was found to be 79% effective in protecting against Covid-19 in interim Phase 3 clinical trials overseas.<br />The vaccine, along with two other homegrown candidates, was earlier approved for emergency use in China. Beijing grants conditional approvals for vaccines that haven’t completed clinical trials if it is deemed to be urgent to cope with public health emergencies. The new approval is the first allowing for broader use of a coronavirus vaccine in the country.<br />Sinopharm has started mass production of the newly approved vaccine, Mao Junfeng, an official at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said Thursday.<br />Drugmakers must still submit final results after they receive conditional approval. Mr. Chen, the regulatory official, said authorities will keep a close eye on Sinopharm to ensure it carries out its Phase 3 trial as planned."
