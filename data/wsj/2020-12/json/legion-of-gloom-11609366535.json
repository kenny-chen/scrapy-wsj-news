    "body": "Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has soured on the idea of closing schools in response to Covid-19, amid overwhelming evidence of student harm and  a lack of evidence of public benefit. But the destructive policy seems to have a new lease on life in politics. In a dreary Tuesday speech in Wilmington, Del., President-elect Joe Biden suggested that some schools should remain closed through April--and even longer if there is not another huge round of federal spending on education.<br />Mr. Biden, discussing the period following his Jan. 20 inauguration, said:<br />Taxpayers may be even more depressed to learn they will now be asked to fund a Biden administration program to persuade people to ignore the message of the Biden presidential campaign. As candidates, Mr. Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, cast doubt on the safety of any vaccines approved by the Trump administration. On Tuesday, after modestly acknowledging “there’s a vaccination hesitancy in many communities,” Mr. Biden promised “a massive public education campaign to increase vaccine acceptance. We’ll do everything we can to show the vaccines are safe and critically important for one’s own health and that of their families and the communities.”<br />He then promised to “ensure vaccinations are free of charge,” perhaps unaware of existing federal policy. Then Mr. Biden’s speech got a little more confusing when he said:<br />Sounds like someone’s bucking for a demotion."
