    "body": "WASHINGTON—A broad cross section of big U.S. corporations including  Amazon.com Inc.,   Citigroup Inc.  and  Ford Motor Co.  are calling on Congress to work closely with President-elect Joe Biden to address the threat of climate change.<br />In a letter to be sent to Congress and the Biden transition team on Wednesday, more than 40 companies say they support the U.S. rejoining the Paris climate accord, and urge “President-elect Biden and the new Congress to work together to enact ambitious, durable, bipartisan climate solutions.”<br />The letter doesn’t detail any specific action plan or policy proposal, but it is the latest indication that a significant cohort of corporate America is lining up with environmentalists on climate change.<br />General Motors Co.  said last week that it will no longer back the Trump administration’s legal battle to strip California’s authority to set its own fuel-efficiency regulations.<br />Days before that, the American Farm Bureau Federation—once one of the major opponents of climate legislation in Congress—announced a new agribusiness coalition to promote federal support for cutting agricultural emissions."
