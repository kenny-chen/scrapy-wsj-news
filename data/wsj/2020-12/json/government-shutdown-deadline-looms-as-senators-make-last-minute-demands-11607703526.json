    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate passed a stopgap measure funding the government for one week, providing more time to negotiate a broader spending package and a coronavirus-relief agreement, as lawmakers looked to break a deadlock over liability protections.<br />President Trump will have until 12:01 a.m. Saturday to sign the legislation extending funding through Dec. 18 and avert a government shutdown.<br />The Senate passed the short-term funding bill by unanimous consent early Friday afternoon, after Sens. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) dropped their objections to the bill proceeding. The pair has sought to pass another round of $1,200 direct checks for many Americans.<br />The push to keep the government funded comes as lawmakers are still seeking to craft a coronavirus relief bill. While top Senate Republicans have indicated that a bipartisan group’s efforts to find a compromise on a $908 billion framework won’t likely win their support, the coalition of Republicans and Democrats continued negotiations on Friday.<br />At the center of the talks is composing legal protections for businesses, health care providers and schools that both Democrats and Republicans can support."
