    "body": "WASHINGTON—Mike Pompeo, who spent four years overseeing the Trump administration’s foreign intelligence and international-relations apparatus, plans to move back to Kansas, where supporters and observers say he is well positioned for domestic political pursuits.<br />In an interview at his State Department office, Mr. Pompeo said he and his wife, Susan, aim to return at some point to Kansas to be with friends, family and their church community. As a congressman, he represented the state’s Fourth District for six years.<br />During the last weeks of the Trump administration, the secretary of state declined to rule out possible future runs for public office, saying he is focused on his current job and hasn’t thought much about what is next. But longtime supporters see Mr. Pompeo leveraging his national and international stature for a future run for governor, U.S. senator or, one day, president or vice president.<br />“From the perspective of what I’m hearing within the party, he can do whatever he wants,” said Mike Kuckelman, chairman of the Kansas Republican Party.<br />Kansas Republican National Committeeman Mark Kahrs sees Mr. Pompeo as a possible challenger to Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in two years. While Mr. Kahrs said he still hopes President Trump will serve a second consecutive term, he believes Mr. Pompeo has a strong claim as Mr. Trump’s successor someday."
