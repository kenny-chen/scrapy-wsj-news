    "body": "Toll Brothers Inc.’s  sales rose in the latest quarter, fueled by low borrowing costs and shifting living preferences driven by the pandemic.<br />The luxury home builder said it generated $2.55 billion in sales, a 7% increase from a year ago and ahead of analysts’ projections of $2.08 billion, according to FactSet. Revenue from home sales, which represents a majority of the company’s total revenue, rose about 9% to $2.5 billion.<br />“We are currently experiencing the strongest housing market I have seen in my 30 years at Toll Brothers, and we continue to increase prices in nearly all of our communities,” Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said in prepared remarks.<br />The number of contracts for new homes increased 68% to 3,407 units from last year, while contract value rose 63% to $2.74 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31.<br />The U.S. housing market has gotten a boost from pandemic trends as many have left large cities in search of bigger homes in less crowded areas where they can work remotely and enjoy more space."
