    "body": "The dollar’s weakness is complicating matters for both policy makers and investors in Europe.<br />Bets that Covid-19 vaccines will propel the global economic recovery next year have prompted investors to buy assets outside the U.S., pushing the dollar lower in recent weeks. That has left the euro up more than 8% against the greenback this year, and near its highest level since April 2018. It traded Wednesday at about $1.2135 apiece.<br />The rally in the common currency threatens to impede European policy makers’ efforts to stoke inflation in the region. A stronger euro makes exports from the region less competitive overseas, potentially curbing economic growth. It would also make imports less expensive for the eurozone, and damp inflation.<br />Such concerns are eroding investors’ appetite for eurozone stocks. The Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark for the region, has dropped more than 5% since the end of last year. That compares with the S&P 500 index’s almost 15% gain.<br />The region’s pace of economic growth “is okay, but not enough to put any upward pressure on inflation,” said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for core investments at AXA Investment Managers. “It’s not a time for big asset-allocation decisions in Europe.”"
