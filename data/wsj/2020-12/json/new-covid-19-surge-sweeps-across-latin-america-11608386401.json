    "body": "Mexico City has ordered nonessential businesses closed for the holiday season as a rebound in Covid-19 cases threatens to overwhelm hospitals. Brazil, with the second-highest number of official Covid-19 deaths after the U.S., registered record rates of new infections in recent days. Parts of Peru are seeing testing positivity rates of nearly 100%.<br />Latin America, with more deaths per capita during the pandemic than any other region, is suffering from a second surge of Covid-19, ending a period of several months where cases and deaths declined. The surge is particularly acute in the region’s two biggest countries, Mexico and Brazil.<br />Daily deaths in Brazil topped 1,000 on Thursday for the first day since September, and the country posted roughly 70,000 new daily infections on Wednesday and Thursday, a record. In Mexico, the daily death toll has doubled to about 600 a day from about 320 in mid-October.<br />“We urgently need to bend the curve of contagion,” said Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico City’s mayor, this week. Health authorities ordered the closure of nonessential businesses such as restaurants and shopping malls from Saturday until Jan. 10 across the capital and surrounding municipalities, home to some 22 million people.<br />Cases are rising quickly in Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Chile, and even in Uruguay and Paraguay, two nations that had escaped relatively unharmed from the pandemic."
