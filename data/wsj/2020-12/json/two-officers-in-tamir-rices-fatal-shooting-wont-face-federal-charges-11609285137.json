    "body": "Federal prosecutors said Tuesday they wouldn’t bring federal charges against two police officers in the fatal police shooting of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was killed in 2014 while playing with a toy gun.<br />The action closes a long-running civil-rights investigation into a case that helped spark a nationwide conversation on police use of force against Black Americans.<br />Prosecutors informed Tamir’s family of their decision this week and released a statement to the media on Tuesday, saying the boy’s death at the hands of two officers didn’t meet the standard for bringing federal civil-rights charges against the police.<br />To bring such charges, prosecutors would need to prove that the officers’ use of force was unreasonable and that the officers broke the law willfully and deliberately. The split-second decision to open fire on Tamir, based on the officers’ stated belief that the toy gun was a real threat, didn’t meet that burden, according to the department.<br />“Although Tamir Rice’s death is tragic, the evidence does not meet these substantial evidentiary requirements,” the Justice Department said."
