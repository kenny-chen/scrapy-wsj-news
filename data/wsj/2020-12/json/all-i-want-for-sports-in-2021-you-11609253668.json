    "body": "We’ve got a day or two left in 2020, but I’m ready to close out the tab and call it a year. How about you? Usually around now, I do one of those “Best of the Year” lists, with flowery superlatives about sports items I witnessed, but that doesn’t feel right.<br />Enough with 2020. I’m good. You good? I bet you are. Let me pay the check and get us out of here.<br />I miss you all. Every last one of you. That’s my big takeaway from 2020. I want everyone back. ASAP.<br />Sure, sports came back. In March, we went suddenly from sports, to no sports, to nothing besides cage fighting, plus soccer in Belarus, a bit of sumo, maybe darts, and then, by late summer, almost every sport was rushing back, to the point it got ridiculous—we had baseball, basketball and Stanley Cup games colliding with football, plus tennis, the Tour de France, horse racing and that socially distant barbecue you got invited to which was fun but also a little weird.<br />It was hard to keep track of. Maybe you followed every minute of sports in 2020. Maybe you ignored it altogether. It was an unprecedented shutdown and comeback, not without challenges and curious optics—no fans in the ballparks; Covid-19 positives; canceled games; colleges charging into football at a time colleges were still closed to, you know, college."
