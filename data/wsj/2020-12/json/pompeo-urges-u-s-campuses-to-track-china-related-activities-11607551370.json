    "body": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said American academic institutions should do more to combat Chinese government influence and activities.<br />In a speech Wednesday at Georgia Institute of Technology, Mr. Pompeo said schools should make a “rigorous evaluation” of prospective students from China, work to prevent foreign intellectual-property theft, disclose foreign funding and monitor student activities on campus.<br />“We have a responsibility to police this,” Mr. Pompeo said. “Some of that is the responsibility of the United States government to undertake, and we have to do a better job of doing that, but we need institutions, too, that are transparent, that are clear, that are following the requirements of the U.S. Department of Education.”<br />The Trump administration has undertaken an effort on multiple fronts to fight what it views as Chinese-government linked entities improperly siphoning U.S. academic research and other meddling at U.S. campuses.<br />Federal prosecutors have brought more than a dozen criminal cases accusing academics of lying about receiving Chinese government funding or visiting researchers of lying about their affiliation with the Chinese military."
