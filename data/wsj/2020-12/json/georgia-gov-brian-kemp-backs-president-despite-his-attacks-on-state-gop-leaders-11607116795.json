    "body": "A month after the presidential election, Georgia remains in a high state of political tension.<br />President Trump and his supporters have questioned the legitimacy of the election results in Georgia after President-elect Joe Biden won by a slim margin. They have criticized Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans, and called on them to investigate and overturn the results. State election officials have strongly defended the election and how it has been handled.<br />The discord of the election has opened up deep rifts within GOP ranks in the state, which has been dominated by the Republican Party for decades.<br />Mr. Trump is heading to Georgia on Saturday to campaign for incumbent GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who are fighting to hold onto their seats in a pair of key Jan. 5 runoffs that will determine control of the U.S. Senate. Mr. Perdue is facing Democrat Jon Ossoff, and Ms. Loeffler is facing Democrat Raphael Warnock.<br />Mr. Raffensperger said this week that the latest of two recounts is expected to confirm that Mr. Biden won the state. Mr. Trump and his supporters have called on Georgia officials to reexamine signatures on absentee-ballot envelopes, something the Secretary of Stateâ€™s Office says is unnecessary because the signatures were already checked before ballots were counted."
