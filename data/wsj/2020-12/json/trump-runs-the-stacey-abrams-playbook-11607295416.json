    "body": "Atlanta<br />November’s election was the most secure in history. In Georgia there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud and no significant issues with absentee ballots. Through three separate counts, including one by hand, the outcome in Georgia has remained the same.<br />The crisis America’s elections face is not one of security, but one of confidence. The roots of this crisis stretch back long before the 2020 election. Confidence has been undermined by politicians and pundits who tacitly or explicitly refuse to acknowledge their losses and receive a megaphone from sympathetic media outlets.<br />In Georgia, we have seen this firsthand for years. Gov. Brian Kemp defeated Stacey Abrams in 2018, yet Ms. Abrams still refuses to acknowledge she lost.<br />Establishing a playbook that President Trump is following to the letter now, Ms. Abrams refused to concede, announced that she would launch major litigation against Georgia’s election system, and began collecting hundreds of millions of dollars from donors convinced the election had been stolen from her."
