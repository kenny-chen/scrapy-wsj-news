    "body": "BP PLC  has bought a controlling stake in the largest U.S. producer of carbon offsets, doubling down on a bet that preserving forests will be key to companies meeting their carbon-reduction goals.<br />The oil giant in late 2019 made a $5 million venture investment in Pennsylvania’s Finite Carbon, which helps landowners sell their forests as carbon sinks. With majority ownership of Finite, BP plans to take global the business of paying landowners not to cut down trees.<br />BP and Finite didn’t disclose financial terms of the latest deal but said that the forestry firm was now part of the energy company’s Launchpad. The unit functions similarly to a private-equity firm by taking big economic stakes in businesses with an eye toward steering them through expansion.<br />“Finite Carbon has the potential to build a global platform for managing and financing natural climate solutions,” said David Eyton, BP’s executive vice president of innovation and engineering.<br />BP itself has been one of the world’s biggest buyers of forest carbon-offset credits, a type of climate-change currency. The company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on offsets to comply with California regulators. They operate a so-called cap-and-trade system that aims to reduce greenhouse gasses by making it more expensive over time for companies operating in the state to pollute."
