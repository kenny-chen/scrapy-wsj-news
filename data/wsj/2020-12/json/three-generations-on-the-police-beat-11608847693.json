    "body": "Staten Island, N.Y.<br />John McAuliffe recalls an incident from his rookie days with the New York City Police Department. It was 1983, and he was on patrol in the 71st Precinct, in Crown Heights, a black-majority Brooklyn neighborhood.<br />“I’m right out of the academy,” he says. “I’m with a training officer. And we see a guy do a minor traffic infraction where maybe he and his regular partner wouldn’t have intervened.” But they stopped the driver so the callow Mr. McAuliffe could get practice pulling a car over and safely approaching it.<br />As officer and trainee moved toward the stationary vehicle, they saw a young boy—presumably the driver’s son—in the back seat. “I was supposed to do the talking,” Mr. McAuliffe recalls, “and the older cop was going to watch me. But he took over.” He told the driver to be more careful and said, “No, you don’t have to show me your license. Have a good night.” When the two got back to their squad car, the veteran told the rookie: “Never embarrass a guy in front of his kid.”<br />Such lessons, Mr. McAuliffe says, “are not being taught to cops these days.”"
