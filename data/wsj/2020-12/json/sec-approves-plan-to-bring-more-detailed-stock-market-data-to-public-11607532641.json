    "body": "The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a plan to beef up the public data feeds that broadcast stock prices to investors, broadening access to market information that exchanges sell to professional traders at a premium.<br />Under the SEC’s plan, detailed data showing supply and demand for stocks will be added to the public feeds, which are called securities information processors, or SIPs. Wall Street banks and electronic trading firms use such data to predict short-term price moves and ensure that they get good prices when buying or selling stocks.<br />Another part of the SEC’s plan allows upstart versions of the SIPs to compete with the existing feeds, which are operated by the New York Stock Exchange and  Nasdaq Inc.<br />Together, the measures amount to one of the biggest overhauls of the SIPs since the rules governing them were passed in the 1970s. They are also a parting shot by departing SEC Chairman Jay Clayton at big stock-exchange operators that have challenged a number of commission rules during his term.<br />The SEC’s commissioners voted unanimously Wednesday to implement the plan despite opposition from the exchange operators, which could lose lucrative data revenue if the changes spur their customers to ditch their premium data feeds for the cheaper SIPs."
