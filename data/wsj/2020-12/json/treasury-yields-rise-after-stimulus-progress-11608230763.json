    "body": "U.S. government bond yields climbed Thursday after signs of new progress on economic relief efforts in Congress.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note finished Thursday’s trading session at 0.929%, according to Tradeweb, up from 0.920% at Wednesday’s close. The 30-year yield rose to 1.675%, from 1.666% Wednesday.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, reversed an early morning decline after lawmakers signaled they were close to agreement on a roughly $900 billion stimulus package.<br />The 10-year yield had dipped below 0.9% earlier in the session after Labor Department data showed the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits increased last week, another sign the U.S. economic rebound is slowing. Unemployment claims rose to 885,000, exceeding expectations from economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Yields are also being pulled in different directions by competing views on the recovery and recent actions by the Federal Reserve, analysts said. The central bank is committed to aiding the economy by keeping borrowing costs low, setting short-term interest rates near zero and buying billions of dollars of bonds."
