    "body": "Peggy Noonan supplies an impressive list of “Mrs. Smith’s Tips for New Lawmakers” (Declarations, Dec. 12) in her continued reminiscing about former Republican Sen. Margaret Chase Smith. Ms. Noonan admires Smith for her courage in standing up early to Sen. Joe McCarthy in 1950 as well as her moderation, wisdom, honesty and forthrightness—all qualities sorely needed in Congress today. Ms. Noonan hopes that newcomers to Congress in 2021 will emulate Smith.<br />There is one other notable feature of Smith’s service in Congress that is worth mentioning: Republicans in the House and Senate were a powerless minority for all but four of her 33 years there. Smith, a moderate-to-liberal Republican, got along with Democrats, but this did little to change what happened in Congress. She and her GOP colleagues were little more than spectators while Democrats enacted President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs that blessed us with today’s unaffordable entitlements.<br />Dana Davis<br />St. Augustine, Fla.<br />"
