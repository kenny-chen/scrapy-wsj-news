    "body": "Retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin’s four-decade military career was defined by breakthroughs: He was the first Black general to lead a division in combat, to command a theater of war, and to lead U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan.<br />Should Gen. Austin—President-elect Joe Biden’s choice to lead the Defense Department—be confirmed, he would become the first Black secretary in Defense Department history and would be the third recently retired general ever to lead the department.<br />Because of the latter, his confirmation process will require two congressional votes. The first would be by both chambers of Congress on whether to give Gen. Austin a waiver to hold the top Pentagon civilian job even though he has been out of uniform for only four years—short of the seven years required under laws safeguarding the tradition of civilian control of the military. The second vote would be the Senate confirmation vote.<br />Gen. Austin’s career was largely built in the Middle East, while defense leaders have said the biggest challenge to the U.S. now comes from China.<br />Leading up to his confirmation hearing, senators will have a small aperture into his potential policies as defense chief. While in the military, Gen. Austin was sometimes described as the “invisible general”  because of his unwillingness to speak publicly about military campaigns he led."
