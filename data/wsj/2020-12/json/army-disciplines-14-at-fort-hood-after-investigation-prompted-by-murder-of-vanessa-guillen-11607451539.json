    "body": "Army officials announced the firing or suspension of 14 commanders or other senior soldiers on Tuesday over failures to protect troops dealing with sexual assault and harassment.<br />Generals and sergeants major were among those disciplined following a monthslong investigation into lax monitoring procedures at Fort Hood in Texas.<br />Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy launched the independent Fort Hood review in response to a series of deaths and complaints about the base, especially the murder of Spc. Vanessa Guillen. Her case attracted national attention, including from President Trump and President-elect Joe Biden.<br />“This report, without a doubt, will cause the Army to change our culture,” Mr. McCarthy said.<br />After interviewing 2,500 uniformed personnel and civilians, the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee found that base officials didn’t properly handle sexual assault and harassment on the base. It also determined that the Army’s uniformed criminal investigators on base were undertrained and overworked, which prevented them from properly investigating sex crimes and soldier deaths. Investigators also found commanders on the base didn’t act to curtail an environment that allowed for harassment and assault."
