    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG—In August, President Vladimir Putin heralded the approval of a Russian vaccine against Covid-19. Officials promised to produce millions of doses by year’s end.<br />Now, however, those ambitions have been greatly reduced—St. Petersburg, home to five million people, is due to get just 5,000 doses this month—as the country struggles to manufacture the two-shot vaccine, Sputnik V, in large quantities. Russia expects to produce just two million doses by the end of the year, down from the 30 million promised over the summer.<br />“We were all excited when 30 million doses were promised,” said Dmitry Kulish, professor at Moscow-based private research institute Skoltech, which focuses on pharmaceutical innovation. “But that was a hyper-optimistic forecast. We are more realistic now.”<br />To help ramp up production, Russian authorities have turned to a clutch of companies including BIOCAD, a private-sector pharmaceutical company that hasn’t been involved in vaccine work before. Hundreds of its scientists and technicians are now racing to find ways to transform small amounts of the vaccine into tens of millions of doses.<br />“Scaling is a complex process,” said Dmitry Morozov, BIOCAD’s chief executive. “What was effective in the lab may not be replicated in large volumes.”"
