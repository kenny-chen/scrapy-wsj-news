    "body": "The pound and British stocks fell on Friday ahead of a crunch weekend of talks that could see a disruptive break between the U.K. and the European Union.<br />The pound fell more than 0.5% against both the dollar and euro on Friday, as the two sides failed to agree on a free-trade deal. The FTSE 100 index of leading U.K. stocks slid nearly 1% along with other European share indexes as investors across the region sought the safety of government bonds. U.K. 10-year government bond yields slid 0.033 percentage point to 0.17%, touching their lowest point since mid-October, according to FactSet.<br />While Friday’s moves were relatively mild compared with previous bouts of Brexit turmoil, they showed renewed investor disquiet about how the U.K.’s departure from the EU could add to the economic struggles from the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, set a deadline of Sunday for negotiators to thrash out an agreement over issues including fishing rights and how to maintain similar standards for products and labor markets.<br />Both sides again warned people to be ready for no deal on Friday."
