    "body": "Some of Europe’s largest money managers pledged on Friday to make their investment portfolios reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.<br />The group of 30 signatories represent more than $9 trillion in assets and include Bank of Montreal Global Asset Management, Wellington Management in North America, Asset Management One in Japan, AXA Investment Managers, Legal & General Investment Management and UBS Asset Management.<br />As part of the commitment, the group of signatories, called the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, said it would work with clients on these goals and set interim targets in line with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. These targets will have to be set within the next year and reviewed every five years, with the aim to have all of the group’s assets under management eventually included, the group said in a statement.<br />The pledge is the latest effort by asset managers, including asset management firm  BlackRock Inc.,  to encourage companies they invest in for their clients to meet higher environmental standards. BlackRock, however, hasn’t signed onto this initiative.<br />Many of the recent green commitments haven’t specified consequences for companies that don’t meet the emissions targets."
