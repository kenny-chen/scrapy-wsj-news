    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden’s selection this week of former U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to again head the agency taps a familiar Farm Belt policy maker to helm a department critical to helping farmers and hungry Americans survive the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The USDA’s dual role—overseeing food aid for Americans and regulating food production—is at the heart of a renewed debate over the agency’s focus, as Covid-19’s economic toll has deepened food insecurity in the U.S. while compounding challenges for farmers.<br />Mr. Vilsack led the USDA through President Barack Obama’s two terms and has traction with both farm and food constituencies. He also has an established relationship with Mr. Biden, who settled on Mr. Vilsack as a veteran agriculture official who, if confirmed, could immediately take charge of the sprawling agency, according to a transition spokesman.<br />Mr. Vilsack’s selection drew both praise and criticism from agriculture and food-security groups, signaling the battles ahead for the agency as it guides farmers and consumers out of the pandemic.<br />“The challenges are astonishing,” said Andrew Novaković, a Cornell University emeritus professor of agricultural economics who worked for the USDA during Mr. Vilsack’s tenure."
