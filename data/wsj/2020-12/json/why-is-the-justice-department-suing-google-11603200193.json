    "body": "A pair of sweeping antitrust lawsuits against Google this fall essentially grapple with one central question: Is Google good?<br />For most of its 22-year history, the search giant has enjoyed an enviable public reputation as an omnipresent yet benevolent force. As its parent,  Alphabet Inc.,  morphed into a trillion-dollar conglomerate—more than five times as large as a decade ago—top executives stuck to their line that Google’s market dominance is simply because consumers choose to use its products. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said this year, “I’m really focused on giving users what they want.”<br />The antitrust lawsuits—from federal prosecutors and a separate coalition of 10 states—allege nefarious activities. They say Google, through secretive, interlocking agreements with other technology giants including  Apple Inc.  and  Facebook Inc.,  muscles out competitors and sells out the very users it claims to protect. “The halcyon days of Google’s youth are a distant memory,” says the state lawsuit, led by Texas. “Its modus operandi is to monopolize and misrepresent.”<br />Here is a look at the dueling narratives.<br />Federal and state prosecutors undertook separate, overlapping investigations over the course of roughly a year and a half. The federal suit, filed in October, focused on Google’s flagship search business, which accounts for the vast majority of U.S. queries. The government said the status quo effectively left no room for competition."
