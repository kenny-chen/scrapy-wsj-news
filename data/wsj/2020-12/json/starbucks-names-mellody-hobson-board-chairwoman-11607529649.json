    "body": "Starbucks Corp.  appointed investor Mellody Hobson as its next chairwoman, positioning the coffee chain to be among the biggest U.S. companies with a Black person leading its board.<br />Seattle-based Starbucks said Wednesday that Ms. Hobson would succeed Myron Ullman III as the leader of its board when he retires in March. Ms. Hobson, co-chief executive at Ariel Investments LLC, has been a member of the Starbucks board since 2005.<br />Ms. Hobson, 51 years old, is among the most prominent Black investors in the U.S. Chicago-based Ariel Investments, a roughly $13 billion value-investment firm, says it is the country’s oldest minority-run mutual-fund firm.<br />John Rogers Jr., Ariel’s chairman and investment chief, is a longtime director at McDonald’s Corp. Mr. Rogers and Ms. Hobson are both Democratic donors and supported former President Barack Obama.<br />Many companies have pledged recently to increase diversity in their workforces and boards.  Nasdaq Inc.  filed a proposal with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that would require listed companies to have at least one woman on their boards, in addition to a director who is a racial minority or one who self-identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer."
