    "body": "China is seeking to invest its economic growth into equaling American military capabilities by 2035 and aims to be able to defeat the U.S. in an armed conflict by midcentury, the top U.S. military commander said.<br />“They are on a path to try to do that,” Army Gen. Mark Milley said of Beijing’s ambitions in an interview at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council summit on Tuesday. “It is certainly a significant security challenge for the United States now and in the years to come.”<br />To defend against a rising China, the U.S. must develop its own economic and military power as it relations between the two countries, Gen. Milley said. He warned, “We don’t want great-power competition to turn into great-power war. That would be a disaster.”<br />Chinese officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment but have said previously that the country’s military is intended for peaceful purposes.<br />Gen. Milley said the U.S. military must be prepared to launch offensive and defensive moves both in space and cyber operations, particularly against rivals like China and Russia, both of which are developing their military capabilities in those domains."
