    "body": "Tyson Foods Inc.  said it fired seven managers of an Iowa meatpacking plant following the company’s investigation into allegations that they had wagered on Covid-19 infections among employees.<br />Tyson announced the investigation in November, after a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the family of a deceased Tyson worker claimed that managers of the company’s Waterloo, Iowa, pork-processing facility organized a betting pool around how many employees would contract the coronavirus and pressured sick employees to stay on the job.<br />After the allegations came to light, Tyson said it suspended some plant managers without pay and hired law firm Covington & Burling to investigate.<br />“The behaviors exhibited by these individuals do not represent the Tyson core values, which is why we took immediate and appropriate action to get to the truth,” said Dean Banks, Tyson’s chief executive. A company spokesman declined to identify the terminated managers.<br />The claims surfaced as Tyson and other U.S. meat processors face another national surge in Covid-19 infections. Record numbers of cases around the country have tested defenses meat companies put in place in response to springtime outbreaks that sickened thousands of workers, forced temporary plant closures and led to meat shortages in some supermarkets."
