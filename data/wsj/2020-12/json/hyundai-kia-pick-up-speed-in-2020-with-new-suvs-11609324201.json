    "body": "In a tough year for the car business,  Hyundai Motor Group  picked up momentum in 2020, aided by a slate of new sport-utility vehicles that have resonated with American buyers.<br />The South Korean auto-manufacturing giant, which sells vehicles under two separate companies—Hyundai Motor Co. and affiliate  Kia  Motors Corp.—expanded its U.S. market share more than any other major auto maker through November and held retail sales steady during the period, defying the broader industry’s 12% drop, according to market research firm J.D. Power.<br />As investors have lavished attention on electric-vehicle startups, shares of Hyundai and Kia, listed separately on the Korea Exchange, also rallied in 2020, climbing 67% and 49%, respectively, through Tuesday’s close and outperforming other traditional auto makers such as  General Motors Co.  and  Volkswagen AG .<br />“The market has been down for everyone, but they seem to be the ones coming out of it stronger,” said Vanessa Ton, senior industry intelligence manager at research firm Cox Automotive.<br />Hyundai and Kia have for years worked to elevate their profile in the U.S., where both started out as budget brands selling to price-sensitive buyers. The two had some success early last decade, redesigning their sedans with new looks and improved fuel economy, helping them boost sales."
