    "body": "StockX LLC, an online marketplace popular with sneaker collectors, raised a fresh round of funding that valued the startup at $2.8 billion, more than doubling its valuation from last year.<br />Investors, including Tiger Global Management and Altimeter Capital, put $275 million in the company this week. StockX has now raised $490 million through private investors.<br />StockX Chief Executive Scott Cutler, a former executive at eBay Inc. and the New York Stock Exchange, said in an interview that the company was profitable for the first time in the third quarter, with revenue rising 75% year over year. He said the website averaged a record 25 million monthly visitors in the quarter, including 10 million over the Black Friday weekend. “I think that’s just representative of the growth in the business.”<br />The Detroit-based company started in 2016 as an online platform to buy and sell rare sneaker models, before expanding into streetwear, handbags, accessories and electronics. StockX emulates a stock exchange by providing market data for items, including the 52-week high and volatility. It generates revenue by keeping a percentage of each transaction.<br />StockX joins online companies, including  Wayfair Inc.  and  Etsy Inc.,  that have benefited from changes to shopping habits during the coronavirus pandemic. High-profile startups  DoorDash Inc.  and  Airbnb Inc.  went public this month and surged in their first day of trading."
