    "body": "Tip O’Neill famously advised that “all politics is local.” Not on Jan. 5 and not in Georgia.<br />On that day Georgians will choose their two U.S. senators. But the outcome has more to do with Washington than Georgia. If Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock both win, their party will hold not only the White House but both houses of Congress. This would give Joe Biden an opportunity to run the table on everything from judicial nominees and tax hikes to trillions in spending.<br />But if one or both Republican incumbents prevail—Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler—Mitch McConnell will continue to lead a Republican majority that would then be in a position to block much of Mr. Biden’s agenda. In this way the outcome of the double runoff will help determine the power and reach of the Biden administration.<br />The latest RealClearPolitics average shows Mr. Perdue leading Mr. Ossoff 49.6% to 48.0%, and Ms. Loeffler up over Mr. Warnock 49.2% to 48.4%. But the results remain within the margin of error, and there are too many variables to predict the outcome with any confidence.<br />The biggest variable is who will turn out, and in what numbers. According to Georgia Votes, 1,471,144 people have voted so far—roughly 1 in 5 registered voters. Based on which party ballot those who voted in the June primary requested, it’s now running 59% to 39% in favor of Democrats."
