    "body": "One of China’s biggest banks has been fined nearly $8 million over an investment product that generated big losses for individual investors when U.S. oil prices briefly went negative.<br />Bank of China Ltd.  was fined 50.5 million yuan, the equivalent of $7.7 million, and four of its global markets staff were fined a further 1.8 million yuan, the equivalent of $280,000, after an investigation into the “Crude Oil Treasure” product, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said Saturday.<br />Many investors in the product were wiped out when U.S. crude futures settled at an unprecedented minus $37.63 a barrel in April—and were told they also had to compensate the bank for the negative value of their holdings when those were sold.<br />Some investors later said the state-owned bank had offered to return 20% of their initial investments and cover any further losses.<br />The regulator said Bank of China had broken several laws and regulations. Among other things, it cited problems with contract terms and internal controls, including unreasonable incentives for staff. It said some clients were allowed to invest despite being too young to buy the product, and the bank used exaggerated advertising and offered gifts to attract customers."
