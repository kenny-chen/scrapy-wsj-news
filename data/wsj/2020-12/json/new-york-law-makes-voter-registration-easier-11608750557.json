    "body": "New Yorkers will be automatically registered to vote when they interact with an array government agencies under a new law signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo that supporters say will increase voter participation.<br />The automatic voter registration law, which takes effect in 2023, would require the state’s departments of motor vehicles, health and labor as well as county and city-run social-service agencies to automatically register people to vote when they do things like apply for a driver’s license.<br />If a citizen is already registered to vote, the agency will work with the state Board of Elections to update their voting address when performing any number of other governmental transactions. A citizen must attest that they are eligible to vote, and may opt not to have their information shared with elections officials.<br />Mr. Cuomo signed the law on Tuesday. Assemblywoman Latrice Walker, a Democrat from Brooklyn and the law’s sponsor, said it “puts New York State on the right side of democracy and history by acknowledging years of voter suppression and making the process to register to vote easy, and accessible to New Yorkers.”<br />Eighteen other states and the District of Columbia have enacted similar laws, according to Deputy Senate Majority Leader Mike Gianaris, a Democrat from Queens who is the measure’s other sponsor."
