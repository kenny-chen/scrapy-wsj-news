Each of them carried an adrenaline auto-injector to deal with their allergies.<br />The U.K. is the first Western country to authorize a Covid-19 vaccine and on Tuesday began its vaccination program with priority recipients including health-care staff, people over 80 years old and residents and staff in nursing homes.<br />The chief executive of the Medical and Health products Regulatory Agency, the body that last week gave the go-ahead for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination to be rolled out across the U.K., told lawmakers on Wednesday that on Tuesday evening it examined two cases of allergic reactions that hadn’t been a feature of the extensive clinical trials of the vaccine."
