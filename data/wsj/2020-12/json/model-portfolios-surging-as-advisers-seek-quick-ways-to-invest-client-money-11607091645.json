    "body": "<br />Assets in model portfolios hit a record high this fall, reflecting growing interest in preset investment options developed by Wall Street firms.<br />Data provider  Broadridge Financial Solutions  estimates that model portfolios held $4.1 trillion of assets in September, up from $3.5 trillion at the end of 2019.<br />Model portfolios are ready-made fund combos delivered through financial advisers and brokerages to everyday investors. There is no ready definition of a model portfolio. But the typical adviser using model portfolios is doing the equivalent of serving a store-bought pie, rather than baking one special from scratch.<br />The portfolios come in all shapes and sizes and are today surging in popularity as advisers seek quick ways to invest client money. A portfolio might use a classic investment formula of 60% in equity strategies and 40% in bond funds split between a dozen funds, for instance, or use algorithms to dynamically shift the funds it invests in as markets change."
