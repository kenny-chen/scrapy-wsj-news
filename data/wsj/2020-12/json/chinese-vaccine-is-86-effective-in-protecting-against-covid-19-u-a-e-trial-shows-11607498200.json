    "body": "DUBAI—A Chinese vaccine candidate showed to be 86% effective in protecting people against Covid-19 in late-stage trials, the United Arab Emirates said, a positive sign for the fight against the virus in the developing world.<br />However, health experts cautioned that more information was needed on the Phase 3 trials. The efficacy rate announced by authorities in the U.A.E., where the trials took place, would put the vaccine above the 50% threshold that international scientists deem necessary to protect people. Candidates developed by Moderna Inc. and jointly by  Pfizer Inc.  and BioNTech SE have shown to have efficacy rates of 94.5% and 95% in the final stages of testing, respectively.<br />The U.A.E. Health Ministry didn’t disclose how many trial participants developed Covid-19 and how many of those received a placebo or a vaccine. It also wasn’t known whether the data was peer reviewed.<br />The results were the first from Phase 3 trials of a Chinese Covid-19 vaccine. Nearly one million Chinese people have already received the shot, which was developed by state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm, after the government granted emergency-use authorization for it in July.<br />Public-health experts said that the headline figure suggested that the world had another working vaccine option, although more details were needed. Some questioned why Sinopharm hadn’t jointly presented the results."
