    "body": "Americans will start seeing $600 stimulus payments from the latest Covid-19 relief legislation land in their bank accounts as soon as Tuesday night, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.<br />The Treasury Department sent a so-called payment file of eligible recipients to the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said via  Twitter ,  opening the door for banks to begin receiving and distributing the funds. Because it may take several days for transfers to clear, some banks aren’t likely to deposit the payments into customer accounts until next week.<br />Paper checks, which are sent to taxpayers who didn’t provide their bank-account information to the Internal Revenue Service in recent tax returns, will begin to be mailed out on Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin said.<br />President Trump on Dec. 27 signed into law a roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid package that will provide a second round of stimulus payments to households.<br />Households below certain income thresholds will get $600 per adult and $600 per child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round delivered earlier in the pandemic. That means a single parent with two children will get $1,800 now after receiving $2,200 in the spring."
