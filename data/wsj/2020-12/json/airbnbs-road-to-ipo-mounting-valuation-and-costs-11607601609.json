    "body": "A pandemic that brought global travel to a standstill couldn’t halt  Airbnb Inc.’s  hotly anticipated public debut.<br />While business is still down overall and nowhere close to pre-pandemic levels, the San Francisco home-rental startup has gained ground over rivals in the hotel industry as people have ventured into small towns and cities to work remotely, or taken a manageable break from a health crisis that has largely kept them at home.<br />One bright spot for the company during the pandemic: rural bookings. Big cities visited by tourists had been Airbnb’s strength, but it redesigned its app and website to focus on local stays as people flocked to destinations within driving distance.<br />In August, more than half of bookings made were for stays within 300 miles of the guest’s location, according to the company.<br />As Airbnb blossomed into a global behemoth, it spent big. Costs jumped five-fold between 2015 and 2019. The pandemic forced the company to shed a quarter of staff, remove noncore businesses and drastically cut sales and marketing, a big expense."
