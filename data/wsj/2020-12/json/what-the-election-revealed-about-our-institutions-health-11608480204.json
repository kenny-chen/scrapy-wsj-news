    "body": "It’s true, as William A. Galston points out in “Institutions Saved the 2020 Election” (Politics & Ideas, Dec. 16), that federal judges ruled impartially on President Trump’s numerous appeals. But Mr. Galston fails to mention the activist judges and state Supreme Court justices who ignored state law to change requirements for mail-in voting, including the proper completion of the ballots and the date at which they would no longer be accepted. Most Americans don’t know if there were election shenanigans or not, but I suspect most wouldn’t want to go through this every four years. Can’t we acknowledge Joe Biden as the president-elect and still investigate the voting process?<br />Tim Eichenbrenner<br />Charlotte, N.C.<br /><br />Mr. Galston writes, “What I should have anticipated but didn’t was how many of Mr. Trump’s supporters would believe him” about election fraud. Fair enough. But how many of the president’s detractors believed that the Steele dossier was true and President Trump assumed office illegitimately? How many believed that Adam Schiff had incontrovertible evidence of Mr. Trump’s collusion with Russia? How many believe that Michael Flynn broke the law when talking with Russia’s ambassador?"
