    "body": "Campbell Soup Co.  said a surge in sales brought on by the coronavirus pandemic is receding, a sign that the acute changes in consumer behavior early in the pandemic may be moderating even as many people stay home while Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations reach all-time highs.<br />Campbell’s U.S. soup sales jumped 21% in the quarter ended Nov. 1 compared with a year ago as pandemic-related restrictions continued to keep people home. However, that was less than half the gains Campbell reported for the prior three months. Supermarket operator Kroger Co. last week also reported slower sales growth than during the first months of the pandemic.<br />Campbell Chief Executive Mark Clouse said Wednesday that he expects people to continue eating more at home even after the pandemic ends. He said some people have become better cooks and that some will likely continue working more from home long-term.<br />“We do not see this as a kind of episodic moment,” he said on a call with investors.<br />The pandemic has provided food makers with an unprecedented opportunity for millions of people to try their products for the first time in years. Like other food makers, Campbell has invested in more advertising to try to maintain the momentum. The company said many of its new customers are young people returning to its soup and snacks."
