    "body": "BRUSSELS—Talks between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Union’s top official ended without breakthrough Wednesday night with both sides saying they would decide on the future of the talks by Sunday.<br />Mr. Johnson traveled to Brussels for dinner discussions with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, with the British prime minister demanding the bloc recognize the U.K.’s sovereign rights over British fishing waters and its freedom to diverge over time from EU regulatory standards.<br />The two sides are racing to complete and win ratification for an agreement that would set bilateral economic and security ties by Dec. 31. Failure to reach a deal would mean from the start of next year tariffs would be applied for the first time in almost a half-century on some trade between the U.K. and the EU, to which it sends 43% of its exports.<br />After the discussion, a senior U.K. government official said “very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged.” The two leaders “agreed that by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks.”<br />Mrs. von der Leyen also said in a statement that the two sides were “far apart.” She said that negotiating teams would immediately resume talks “to try to resolve these essential issues.”"
