    "body": "A  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  unit that buys stakes in alternative investment managers has made its latest push into the real-estate industry by investing in a firm that acquires stores, warehouses and other properties from big companies and then leases them back.<br />The unit, Petershill, in November purchased a minority stake in Oak Street Real Estate Capital LLC, which has raised over $4 billion since launching in 2009. Oak Street’s funds have purchased hundreds of stores, warehouses and office buildings sold and leased back by companies such as  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  and  Big Lots Inc.<br />The size of the stake and the price paid by Goldman weren’t disclosed, but the deal valued Oak Street at $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Since Petershill was founded in 2007, it has invested over $8 billion for stakes in more than 32 investment managers. Other real-estate firms in Petershill’s portfolio include Westbrook Partners and Slate Asset Management.<br />Partnering with Goldman has a range of benefits for investment firms. Fundraising becomes easier because they have access to Goldman’s global network of investors."
