Most notably, some older adults who once viewed themselves as technological Luddites have learned to log into Zoom chats as frequently as the average teenager on Instagram or TikTok.<br />And with the coronavirus pandemic on track to get much worse before it gets better, all this Zooming is likely to continue for a while. So how can an older person get the most out of these virtual connections with family, friends and health-care professionals?<br /><br />First, we should acknowledge that for many seniors, video calls and meetings on Zoom and other platforms typically have a small sensory field, limited by the size of the screen being used, the volume of the speakers and the integrity of the connection. As a result, it can be a struggle for someone with vision or hearing loss. Some people try to compensate by getting closer to the screen. Poor internet connections exacerbate sensory deficits, leading to frustration and sometimes a premature end to the call."
