    "body": "MOSCOW—The Russian capital began rolling out the country’s homegrown coronavirus vaccine to doctors, teachers and social workers on Saturday, as the virus in the world’s fourth-worst hit country continues to spread at a record pace.<br />Russian officials are planning to expand the vaccination campaign nationwide next week in what is expected to be a limited-scale rollout after manufacturers encountered challenges in ramping up production. Russia approved the shot, named Sputnik V, in August, despite criticism from Western scientists about the lack of large-scale clinical trial data at the time.<br />Moscow’s inoculation campaign comes days after the U.K. authorized a vaccine by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  that is expected to be rolled out beginning next week. That shot is also being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S., where a similar authorization could come later this month and a rollout starting before the end of the year.<br />On Saturday, Russia reported a record 28,782 new cases, with the total tally at over 2.4 million. Russia’s cumulative caseload since the onset of the pandemic is behind only the U.S., India and Brazil.<br />In Moscow, which also registered a record number of new cases, some 70 vaccination centers located in hospitals and clinics opened their doors on Saturday morning."
