It can also downplay risk in ways that may lead novices astray.<br />In last week’s column, I described my experience on the popular Robinhood brokerage app, especially how trading became hard to stop once I started. Now let’s look at how Robinhood may encourage risky behaviors that could backfire.<br />Consider some exchange-traded funds. Leveraged ETFs magnify the daily return of a market index, typically doubling or tripling it. Inverse ETFs deliver the opposite of a market’s one-day return, often amplifying that gain or loss with leverage. Volatility ETFs are a pure play on the short-term fluctuations of stocks or other assets.<br />Such funds are fireballs that can heat up a portfolio—or scorch it. ProShares UltraPro QQQ, or TQQQ, seeks to deliver three times the daily return of the Nasdaq-100 index. It gained 35% in November. During the February-March market panic, it lost 70%.<br />The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, which oversees brokerage firms, has warned these ETFs “typically are unsuitable for retail investors who plan to hold them for longer than one trading session.”"
