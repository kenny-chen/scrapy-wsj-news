    "body": "HONG KONG—The families of a group of Hong Kong activists who were detained fleeing the city in a speedboat in August called on Chinese authorities to issue verdicts soon after they were tried in a mainland court.<br />Four hours after a closed-door hearing started Monday, the Yantian District Court in Shenzhen said the trials of 10 of the activists had ended and the verdicts would be announced at another time.<br />“I want to see my son. I won’t be able to see him if you don’t decide,” said the mother of one of the defendants, Wong Wai-yin. The mother has asked not to be identified by name.<br />The fate of those detained—who have been dubbed the Hong Kong 12 by supporters calling for their release—has drawn international attention and become a central issue for pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.<br />The 10 charged are accused of illegal border crossing, which carries a one-year sentence. Two of the 10 are also accused of organizing the attempted escape and are potentially facing longer prison terms. Two others on the boat weren’t charged because they were under the age of 18, but they will be subject to a hearing, the families said they were told."
