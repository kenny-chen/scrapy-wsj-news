    "body": "She was singing on the set of a motion picture that was being produced in wartime. She could have had no idea that her words would carry such present-tense power more than 75 years later.<br />The movie wasn’t about war—it was a musical about a Midwestern family, set in the early 1900s. The film, “Meet Me in St. Louis,” was released in 1944, and its star, Judy Garland, sang the words to Margaret O’Brien, who was playing her little sister.<br />Have yourself a merry little Christmas, let your heart be light.<br />Next year all our troubles will be out of sight.…<br />It was exactly what Americans, weary from the years of World War II, needed to hear: those words of hope—the promise that in the next year all, at last, would be well. From phonographs in living rooms and radios near battlefields, the words to “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” comforted mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, soldiers alone in the dark."
