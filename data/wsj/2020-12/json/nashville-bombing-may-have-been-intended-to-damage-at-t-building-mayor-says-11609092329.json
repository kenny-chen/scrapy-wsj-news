    "body": "Federal authorities on Sunday identified Anthony Warner as the man responsible for the Christmas Day bombing in Nashville, saying that they believe the 63-year-old acted alone and died in the explosion.<br />Officials said DNA from the scene was matched to Mr. Warner, who had previously been identified as a person of interest in the attack. A vehicle identification number from the RV that exploded was also matched to one registered to him.<br />“We’ve come to the conclusion that an individual named Anthony Warner is the bomber, that he was present when the bomb went off, and that he perished in the bombing,” Donald Cochran, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, said at a press conference Sunday.<br />Officials said they had no evidence that anyone else had been involved in the attack. No one else was seen coming or going from the RV that exploded in security footage.<br />Douglas Korneski, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Memphis field office, said investigators haven’t identified Mr. Warner’s motive and asked anyone who knew him to come forward. “Right now we’re looking at any and all possible motives,” Mr. Korneski said."
