    "body": "The man authorities say was the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history, with nearly 60 confirmed victims, died Wednesday in California. He was 80.<br />Samuel Little, who had diabetes, heart trouble and other ailments, died at a California hospital, according to the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He was serving a life sentence for multiple counts of murder.<br />California corrections department spokeswoman Vicky Waters said there was no sign of foul play and his cause of death will be determined by a coroner.<br />A career criminal who had been in and out jail for decades, Little denied for years he had ever killed anyone.<br />Then, in 2018, he opened up to Texas Ranger James Holland, who had been asked to question him about a killing it turned out Little didnâ€™t commit. During about 700 hours of interviews, however, Little provided details of scores of slayings only the killer would know."
