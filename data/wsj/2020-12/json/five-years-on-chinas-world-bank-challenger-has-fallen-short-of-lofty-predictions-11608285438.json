    "body": "In a little over a month, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will be five years old. Back then, the nascent China-organized multinational lender was described as a challenger to the Asian Development Bank and even the World Bank.<br />But after half a decade in operation, the reality doesn’t quite match the hype.<br />The AIIB reported $30.78 billion in assets at the end of September. Even combined with the $19.32 billion of the New Development Bank, another Chinese-led multilateral bank, that is still less than a fifth of the Asia Development Bank’s $250.8 billion.<br />Both are overshadowed by World Bank Group’s constituent parts: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association and the International Finance Corp. together hold more than $600 billion in assets.<br />Despite a surge in lending this year—the AIIB is well-capitalized and was able to manage a considerable increase—it made up less than 5% of the new lending disbursed by international financial institutions, and even less of the approved figure, according to data compiled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies."
