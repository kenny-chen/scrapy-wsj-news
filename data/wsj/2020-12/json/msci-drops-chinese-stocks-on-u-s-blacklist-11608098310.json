    "body": "MSCI Inc.  will strip its indexes of stocks in seven Chinese companies that the U.S. government says help China’s military, including the country’s largest chip maker and a major producer of surveillance equipment.<br />The move, which will take effect by the close of business on Jan. 5, follows similar actions by other benchmark providers including FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices. It will affect 10 securities that trade in either Hong Kong, Shanghai or Shenzhen.<br />Last month, President Trump signed an executive order barring Americans from investing in 31 Chinese companies that the U.S. Defense Department says supply and otherwise support China’s military, intelligence and security services.<br />In a statement after U.S. markets closed Tuesday, MSCI said its list only includes securities issued by companies explicitly named in the order, but not those from subsidiaries or affiliated companies.<br />That means some of the largest stocks that could potentially have been affected by the order—such as  China Mobile Ltd. , which has a roughly $117 billion market value—have been spared, and the overall impact on indexes will be limited. FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones took a similar approach."
