    "body": "No one is better known across the world for advocating democracy in Hong Kong than Jimmy Lai. So when Hong Kong police picked him up Wednesday on dubious fraud charges, China was sending a clear message: If you oppose us anywhere in the world, we will crush you.<br />In Mr. Lai’s case the decision to arrest him over the terms of a business lease sends the additional message that any charges will do. Though the fraud charge is not as serious as some of the others he already faces, especially on national security, its purpose is to dirty him up before he goes to trial on the others.<br />It’s no coincidence he was detained the same day three other pro-democracy champions—Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam—pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison for participating in 2019 protests against a proposed extradition law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rightly denounced the sentences as “appalling.”<br />We trust Joe Biden is paying attention. No doubt he’s not eager to start trouble with China. But Chinese leader Xi Jinping has his own priorities. He is testing whether a Biden Administration—especially one seeking a climate accord—will look the other way on China’s behavior in Hong Kong and elsewhere.<br />The Trump Administration, in particular Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has spoken up for Mr. Lai. The Administration has also sanctioned Chinese and Hong Kong officials for “undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of the citizens of Hong Kong.”"
