Take New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who in October said the American public “should be” skeptical of a Covid-19 vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration during the Trump presidency. He also promised to convene a state panel to review trial data before distributing shots to the public.<br />Then on Nov. 13 Mr. Cuomo accused President Trump of bullying him by saying “we won’t be delivering [a vaccine] to New York until we have [state] authorization to do so. . .Gov. Cuomo will have to let us know when he’s ready for it. Otherwise we can’t be delivering it to a state that won’t be giving it to its people.”"
