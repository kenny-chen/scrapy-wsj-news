    "body": "German business software giant  SAP SE  said it would return Qualtrics International Inc. to public markets, in a listing expected to value the business at least 50% above what it paid for the startup two years ago.<br />SAP said in November 2018 it planned to buy the customer-relationship management software vendor shortly before Qualtrics was about to go public. SAP paid around $8 billion, one of its largest acquisitions ever, in a bid to keep pace with rivals such as  Salesforce.com Inc.<br />Provo, Utah-based Qualtrics, in a regulatory filing Monday, set an initial price range of between $20 and $24, which would value the company on a fully diluted basis between $12 billion and $14.4 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. Pricing can change based on investor feedback until the day before a company’s stock starts trading.<br />SAP CEO Christian Klein in July said the company would take Qualtrics public while remaining the majority shareholder. The deal, he said, would allow Qualtrics to better pursue non-SAP business opportunities.<br />Qualtrics shares will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “XM.” SAP will retain a controlling stake in Qualtrics following the planned IPO, including all of the company’s Class B shares that give it extra voting rights."
