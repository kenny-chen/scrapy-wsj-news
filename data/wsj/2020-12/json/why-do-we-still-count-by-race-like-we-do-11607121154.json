    "body": "“The Predicament of Counting Americans by Race” (Review, Nov. 28) quotes Kenneth Prewitt, a former director of the U.S. Census Bureau, as saying, “race is incoherent.” He knows what population geneticists know. There is only one race: the human race. Every scientific attempt to classify humans racially has failed. Race is a social construct that changes on whims, biases and power plays. The amount of melanin pigment in the skin is of minuscule consequence genetically. France, where the government doesn’t officially track the race of its population, has it right. Where France continues to go wrong, apparently, is in its slipshod enforcement of justice and fairness for all people.<br />Jeff Kalenak<br />Brookfield, Wis.<br /><br />For the last five census enumerations, I have listed my race as American. I was born here, as were my parents. My mother’s side of the family has been in the Hudson Valley since before the English fought the French and Indian War. Her ancestors are a mix of several nationalities and the Mohegan Tribe. Most of my father’s family emigrated here in the 1900s. The selections offered by the census don’t fit Americans and haven't for a long time."
