    "body": "After a long year of canceled birthdays and postponed holiday gatherings, the world is more than ready to say goodbye to 2020.<br />Just not to the wine that got them through.<br />Wellness guru Cyndi Ramirez-Fulton, 35, has done January cleanses for years, giving up alcohol and other vices for the month to start the year. But the most temperate New Year’s tradition of all has been called off in her house: she won’t be going dry. “I think we should all be wary of the ‘new year, new you’ marketing push,” says Ramirez-Fulton, the founder and CEO of New York health spa Chillhouse. Instead of a booze-free fast, she’s planning on supporting her local wine shops and restaurants this January.<br />Dry January had been on the rise. The trend of abstaining from alcohol for a month first rose to popularity in the UK after an advocacy campaign to combat unhealthy drinking.
