    "body": "America’s political attention is now focused not on Washington but Georgia, 700 miles south, where a Jan. 5 runoff election will decide that state’s two U.S. Senate seats—and with them, which party controls the upper chamber.<br />These runoffs are required by Georgia law because no Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November. Since Republicans on Jan. 3 will have 50 Senate seats while Democrats will hold 48, the GOP can take control of the chamber by winning one of the seats. But it appears there will be little ticket splitting. Both seats are likely to go to the same party.<br />If Democrats win both, they will control the Senate, since Vice President Kamala Harris can break the 50-50 tie. If Republicans win both, they will keep the Senate and be in an excellent position to halt the Biden administration’s more extreme proposals.<br />What little polling there is suggests it will be close. Each party’s base is motivated, and while turnout will be down from November, it will still be large. Both sides will also have enough money. (As chairman of the Georgia Battleground Fund benefiting Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, I’m working to ensure Republicans do.)<br />Democrats have some advantages going into the runoff. In November their presidential candidate carried Georgia for the first time since 1992. Their defeated gubernatorial candidate from 2018, Stacey Abrams, has built a formidable get-out-the-vote operation. And the state’s demographic changes favor Democrats."
