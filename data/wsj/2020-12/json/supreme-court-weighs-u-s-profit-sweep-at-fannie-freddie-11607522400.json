    "body": "WASHINGTON—Shareholders of  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  that dispute the U.S. government’s decision to sequester the mortgage giants’ profits finally got a hearing before the Supreme Court. They were met with a skeptical reception Wednesday.<br />The case arises from the government’s 2012 decision to channel nearly all of Fannie and Freddie’s profits to the Treasury Department, a bid to reclaim more quickly taxpayer dollars that kept the firms afloat after they were bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis.<br />Shareholders argued that the profit sweep should be invalidated because the firms’ regulator—the Federal Housing Finance Agency—is structured unconstitutionally, with a single director who holds power that isn’t subject to appropriate checks by the president.<br />The Supreme Court agreed with similar arguments in a June decision that ordered a restructuring of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.<br />The case could have broad implications for the housing market, because the firms guarantee about half of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market. Fannie and Freddie make money by collecting fees on those guarantees. All told, they have sent more than $300 billion back to the government, compared with the roughly $190 billion it injected into the firms."
