    "body": "Twenty twenty defies summation. All of us tried; no words ever seemed to capture the whole. But three things are true:<br />You’ll tell your grandchildren about this year, you’ll never forget this year, and your life changed this year, though it may be some time before you know in exactly what way and how much.<br />For now, just scroll down. Go to any social-media account and scroll back to March. You’ll see videos that still have the power to bring tears to the eyes—people in Italy serenading each other from balconies; New York erupting in the 7 p.m. beating of pots and pans.<br />As we scrolled down through this column’s archives, the year flashed before our eyes.<br />In February we were alarmed: We’d been following the virus in China and Italy and felt certain that something bad was coming. There were 13 cases in Canada and one, origin unknown, in California: “We live in a global world. Everybody’s going everyplace all the time. Nothing is contained in the ways it used to be. It seems to me impossible that there are not people walking along the streets in the U.S. who have it, don’t know it and are spreading it.” We thought what was coming would decide the 2020 election. If the virus hit hard, “it is going to change a lot—the national mood, our cultural habits, the economy.” Was the president up to the challenge? “Or has he finally met a problem he can’t talk his way out of?”"
