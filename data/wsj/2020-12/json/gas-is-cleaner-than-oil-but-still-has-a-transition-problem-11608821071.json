    "body": "As a relatively clean fossil fuel, natural gas will play a useful role for years to come. It is less certain that it will be a profitable one.<br />Exuberant investment in new gas reserves and liquefaction facilities in recent years helped globalize the market but also created a glut. Growing Asian demand has pushed prices up dramatically this month, raising hopes of better times. But any sustained recovery in prices and profits will require fossil-fuel producers to resist the temptation to overinvest once again in their favorite green-transition fuel.<br />Future gas demand will balance two major trends: growing prosperity in Asia driving an increase in consumption; and declining sales in Europe and North America. Future profitability depends on how well supply and demand match up.<br />The worldâ€™s biggest economies have promised radical change. The European Union, Japan, South Korea and the U.K. have all committed to cut their net emissions to zero by 2050, while China is aiming for 2060. The U.S. under the Biden administration may join them.<br />Natural gas will likely play two key roles in that green transition: replacing coal-fired power plants until sufficient renewables production can be built; and fueling backup peaker plants to bridge the gaps in intermittent wind and solar generation."
