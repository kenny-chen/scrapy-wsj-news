    "body": "The Rev. Carmen D’Amico stood before his congregation in Muse, a former coal town in western Pennsylvania, and talked about not giving into despair and darkness.<br />“Being in a pandemic doesn’t mean you stop doing what is good,” he told the members of Holy Rosary Catholic Church on a recent rainy Sunday morning, all wearing masks and sitting in every third pew to keep safe distance. “If you know someone is alone, call them up. Reach out to them. Do you have elderly neighbors who need their leaves raked? Do it. Don’t wait for anyone to ask you.”<br />Simple actions matter, he says. “We need to support each other to get through this. We need to be the light for each other.”<br />Religious and community leaders, who like everyone else have been grappling with Covid-19 for months, need a special message for the 2020 holiday season. People are exhausted by the crisis that they thought would be over by now. Many have lost loved ones and jobs. They miss family and friends they can’t safely visit, an absence deeply felt during a season traditionally filled with gatherings and festive concerts and pageants.<br />Here are some of the messages that spiritual leaders are delivering during a time of distress."
