    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Wednesday weighed whether its decision earlier this year requiring juries to be unanimous to convict someone of a crime should be applied retroactively.<br />If a majority of the justices say yes, hundreds or thousands of convictions could be overturned.<br />In Louisiana, Oregon and Puerto Rico, criminal defendants could be convicted even if the jury wasn’t unanimous, until the Supreme Court ruled the practice unconstitutional in April.<br />Wednesday’s argument involved fundamental questions regarding the origin and application of constitutional rights, putting on display the different concerns among individual justices—even those sometimes considered ideological bedfellows.<br />Justice Brett Kavanaugh spoke of the court system’s prejudices against African-Americans. Justice Stephen Breyer worried about forcing authorities to retry or release hundreds of inmates; Justice Neil Gorsuch, who wrote April’s plurality opinion, suggested that concern was irrelevant."
