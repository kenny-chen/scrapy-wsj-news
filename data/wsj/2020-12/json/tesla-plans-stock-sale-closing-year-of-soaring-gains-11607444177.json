    "body": "Tesla Inc.  plans to raise as much as $5 billion through new sales of stock, capitalizing on a market tear that has sent its shares zooming this year.<br />The Palo Alto, Calif.-based electric-vehicle company said Tuesday that it would sell the additional shares over time at market prices. The company raised the same amount of money through a similar program it rolled out in September.<br />Tesla’s share price is more than nine times higher than it was a year ago after adjusting for a recent stock split, as the company has been able to improve its liquidity and keep its streak of profitable quarters going—now up to five—amid the coronavirus pandemic. Last month, S&P Dow Jones Indices said Tesla would be added to the S&P 500 index in December, boosting the stock’s mainstream appeal.<br />The fundraising coincides with significant investments in the company’s production capacity. Tesla is planning to start work on a new U.S. factory in Austin, Texas, and is also building a plant in Berlin.<br />Plans to boost capacity contributed to Tesla’s projections for capital spending in 2021 and 2022. In October, Tesla’s finance chief, Zachary Kirkhorn, told analysts the company expects capital spending of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in each of the next two years."
