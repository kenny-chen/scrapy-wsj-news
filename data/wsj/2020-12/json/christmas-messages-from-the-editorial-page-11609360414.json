    "body": "Thank you for republishing Vermont Royster’s 1949 editorial “In Hoc Anno Domini” (Dec. 24). It is so important, in our world threatened by critical theory and cancel culture, to understand where we came from and the importance of freedom and individual responsibility in delivering us from the “darkness” and “oppression.” Your courage in sharing Paul’s words to the Galatians is one reason that I’ve been a subscriber for more than 60 years.<br />William Beattie<br />Danbury, Conn.<br /><br />I was struck by the ocean of difference in depth between neighboring opinion articles on Christmas Eve. Royster’s “In Hoc Anno Domini” ends by appealing to the best parts of human nature: “And so Paul, the apostle of the Son of Man, spoke to his brethren, the Galatians, the words he would have us remember afterward in each of the years of his Lord: Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”"
