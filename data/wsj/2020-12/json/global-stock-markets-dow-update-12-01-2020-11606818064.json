    "body": "U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday, suggesting that the major indexes may notch fresh records after the market opens.<br />Futures linked to the S&P 500 climbed over 1%, signaling that the broad market gauge is likely to erase its muted losses from Monday and extend the November rally. The S&P 500 ended at an all-time high last week, its 26th for this year.<br />Contracts tied to the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 index rose 1%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 1.1%.<br />Investors’ sentiment has been buoyed in recent weeks by the development of Covid-19 vaccines, which could curtail infection levels and let social and business activity return to pre-pandemic levels.<br />“The mood of the market is rather optimistic,” said Eric Barthalon, global head of capital markets research at Allianz. “For the time being, markets have bought the news that vaccines are going to be rolled out earlier than expected.”"
