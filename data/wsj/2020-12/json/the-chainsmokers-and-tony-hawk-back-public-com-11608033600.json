    "body": "The Chainsmokers have taken an interest in finance, and hope that their latest investment will entice fans to follow.<br />The electronic DJ duo are joining celebrities like professional skateboarder Tony Hawk in backing Public Holdings Inc., which runs Public.com, an investing and social-networking site where users are encouraged to learn from each other about investing and stocks.<br />Although better known for their music, including the Grammy-winning song “Don’t Let Me Down,” the DJs have made a concerted push into investing this year—starting Mantis VC, a venture capital firm, and backing multiple businesses along the way.<br />Their investment in Public highlights two values important to the group: community and financial literacy. They are betting that their Gen Z and Millennial fans share those interests and will use the platform.<br />“We have a deep understanding of things that are important to them,” Alex Pall, one of The Chainsmokers, said of their fans. “I think it’s important to build financial literacy. I’m still building that.”"
