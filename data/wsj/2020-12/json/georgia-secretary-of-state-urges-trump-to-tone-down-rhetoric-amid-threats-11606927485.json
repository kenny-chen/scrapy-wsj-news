    "body": "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Wednesday called on President Trump to tamp down his rhetoric questioning the Nov. 3 election results in the state after election workers have faced threats to their safety.<br />“Even after this office requested that President Trump try and quell the violent rhetoric being born out of his continuing claims of winning the states where he obviously lost, he tweeted out, ‘Expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia,’” Mr. Raffensperger, a Republican, said Wednesday at the state Capitol, referring to a Tuesday night tweet from Mr. Trump.<br />“This is exactly the kind of language that is at the base of a growing threat environment for election workers who are simply doing their jobs,” said Mr. Raffensperger.<br />The secretary of state’s remarks came as the state wraps up a machine recount of the November results that he said was expected to confirm President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. The recount is expected to be completed Wednesday night.<br />Mr. Raffensperger spoke the day after one of his senior staffers, Gabriel Sterling, made an emotional appeal at the state Capitol urging Mr. Trump to condemn threats against election workers."
