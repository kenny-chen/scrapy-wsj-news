    "body": "WASHINGTON—U.S.-based  FireEye  Inc.,  one of the world’s largest cybersecurity firms, was hacked in what it said was a highly sophisticated foreign-government attack that compromised its software tools used to test the defenses of its thousands of customers.<br />The company said the attacker also accessed some internal systems and primarily sought information about government clients. FireEye said it has seen no evidence so far that data belonging to its customers had been compromised from the primary systems used to store it.<br />FireEye declined to comment on who it believed was behind the breach. A person familiar with the matter said Russia is currently seen by investigators as the most likely culprit but stressed that the investigation was continuing.<br />“I’ve concluded we are witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities,” Kevin Mandia, the chief executive at FireEye and a former Air Force officer, said in a blog post published Tuesday. “The attackers tailored their world-class capabilities specifically to target and attack FireEye.”<br />FireEye said it was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and industry partners, including  Microsoft  Corp. , in a continuing investigation into the incident."
