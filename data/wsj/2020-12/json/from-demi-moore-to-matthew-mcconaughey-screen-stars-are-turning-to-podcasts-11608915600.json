    "body": "Early in the pandemic, Demi Moore spent hours in her bathroom listening to women describe their fantasies.<br />“I think about my ex,” says Melanie Griffith, an actress playing a character named Carrie, in a line from “Dirty Diana,” the podcast Ms. Moore was working on. “We’re in our old house. You know, the house we lived in when we were still married.”<br />In the scripted drama, produced by Qcode Media, Ms. Moore plays an accountant who secretly runs a website that streams audio of women sharing their intimate desires. The original plan was to record the show with a cast on a sound stage, but when the pandemic hit, the production went online and the actors interacted with each other remotely over Zoom, from makeshift studios in closets and spare rooms at home.<br />“I went to different rooms and recorded myself and said, hey, which one sounds the best?” Ms. Moore said in a recent Zoom call. “It ended up being my bathroom.”<br />A-list celebrities like Matthew McConaughey, Kristen Wiig, Rami Malek and Cynthia Erivo are turning to scripted fiction podcasts with the production qualities of TV and film—just without the pictures. Alongside film, TV and theater, scripted podcasts have become a popular, somewhat pandemic-proof medium for actors and writers to tell ambitious stories."
