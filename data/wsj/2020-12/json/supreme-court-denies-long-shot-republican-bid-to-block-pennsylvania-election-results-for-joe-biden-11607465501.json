    "body": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a last-ditch Republican request to block President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania, dealing another blow to supporters of President Trump who have contested the Nov. 3 election across the country.<br />The court, in a routine one-sentence order, denied a bid by a Pennsylvania congressman and other Republicans who were pressing an emergency challenge to the state’s vote-by-mail system, enacted by its legislature in 2019.<br />“The application for injunctive relief presented to Justice Alito and by him referred to the Court is denied,” the order said.<br />The lawsuit asked that either all the 2.5 million mail-in ballots cast be thrown out, or that the courts erase Mr. Biden’s victory and direct the state’s GOP-controlled legislature to choose the winner of the state’s 20 electoral votes.<br />As is its custom in emergency orders, the court offered no reasoning in rejecting the challenge. No justice noted a dissent to the Supreme Court’s order."
