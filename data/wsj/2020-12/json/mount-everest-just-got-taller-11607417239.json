    "body": "KATHMANDU, Nepal—Mount Everest just got a little taller.<br />China and Nepal, the two countries Everest straddles, announced that the world’s tallest mountain is now officially the equivalent of 29,032 feet.<br />The new height of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.69 feet) was determined following what geologists said was the most thorough survey of the summit ever. More important, it was the first time a single height was calculated and certified by both Nepal and China. Previously, they had different official heights. China said it was 29,017 feet. Nepal said it was a little taller, at 29,028 feet.<br />“The respect and pride of all Nepalis has risen along with this increase in the height” of Mount Everest, Padma Kumari Aryal, Nepal’s Minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, said at an event in Kathmandu to celebrate the announcement.<br />Nepali scientists wouldn’t speculate on the reason for the higher measurement this time, saying it may have more to do with improvements in technology and calculations."
