    "body": "PARIS—French President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for the coronavirus, his office said Thursday, delivering a blow to a country that has been among Europe’s hardest hit by the pandemic.<br />The 42-year-old was tested after showing symptoms of Covid-19, the Élysée Palace said, adding that he will isolate for seven days while continuing to work. Mr. Macron hasn’t shown severe symptoms, according to a person close to the president.<br />Mr. Macron’s test result immediately rippled across Europe, affecting the activities of a number of leaders who have recently been in contact with him. The Élysée Palace said he received his test results on Thursday, but didn’t specify when the test was administered.<br />The French leader has maintained a busy schedule this fall as France grappled with an onslaught of Covid-19 infections that triggered a six-week lockdown, which was recently replaced with an 8 p.m. curfew. Bars, restaurants and theaters have remained closed across France, but the government has allowed stores and many other businesses to resume operations for the Christmas shopping season. The government plans to relax the curfew on Christmas Eve, allowing holiday gatherings to take place.<br />On Monday, Mr. Macron hosted a lunch with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, European Council President Charles Michel and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Secretary-General Angel Gurría. That was followed by a Tuesday lunch with the party whips of France’s National Assembly. On Wednesday, he lunched with Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa and presided over a cabinet meeting, in which everyone present wore masks and adhered to social-distancing guidelines, a spokeswoman said."
