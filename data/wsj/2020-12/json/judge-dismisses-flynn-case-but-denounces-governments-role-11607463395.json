    "body": "WASHINGTON—A federal judge officially closed the criminal case against former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who was pardoned by President Trump, but suggested that the Justice Department’s handling of the matter was highly irregular and potentially improper.<br />In a 43-page opinion released Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote that he was “troubled by the apparently pretextual nature of certain aspects of the government’s ever-evolving justifications” during the three-year legal saga.<br />In the wake of Mr. Trump’s Nov. 26 pardon of Mr. Flynn, Judge Sullivan issued an order that brought the case to an end. But he also took aim at the way the Justice Department had tried to dismiss the case in May, suggesting that but for the pardon, he may have denied their bid and either forced Mr. Flynn to go to trial or to jail.<br />Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “Dismissal is, of course, the correct result.”<br />Sidney Powell, a lawyer who represents Mr. Flynn, accused Judge Sullivan of bias. She had previously called for him to be recused from the matter."
