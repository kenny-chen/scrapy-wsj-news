    "body": "Two rare events occurred this week and no one alive is likely to see either of them again.<br />The first was the celestial conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, in which the planets appeared closer together than they have in almost 400 years.<br />The second was a sincere political apology.<br />Gen. Gustave Perna, head of Operation Warp Speed, apologized for miscalculating the number of doses of anti-Covid vaccine available to the states. Listening to Gen. Perna’s apology, one thought: Gee, he actually means it.<br />While apologizing, Gen. Perna said something else that caught one’s attention: “I want to take personal responsibility for the miscommunication. I know that’s not done much these days, but I am responsible.”"
