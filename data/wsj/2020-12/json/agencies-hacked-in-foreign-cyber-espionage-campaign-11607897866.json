    "body": "WASHINGTON—Multiple federal government agencies, including the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments, have had some of their computer systems breached as part of a widespread cyber espionage campaign linked to a foreign government, according to officials and people familiar with the matter.<br />Russia’s foreign intelligence service is suspected of being behind the hacks of the U.S. government networks—in which some internal communications are believed to have been stolen—and the operation is believed to be related to a cyber breach disclosed last week of U.S.-based cybersecurity firm  FireEye ,  one of the people familiar with the matter said.<br />The person added that several government agencies in total have likely been compromised.<br />The Commerce Department in a statement confirmed that one of its bureaus had been breached and that it was working with federal partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to probe the matter, but declined to comment further. The hack of Commerce systems includes the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a unit that works on technology policy issues, the person familiar with the matter said.<br />The apparent scope of the hacking operation and the suspected Russian involvement has alarmed national security officials in the Trump administration as well as executives at FireEye, some of whom view it as more significant than a routine foreign cyber espionage, people familiar with the matter said."
