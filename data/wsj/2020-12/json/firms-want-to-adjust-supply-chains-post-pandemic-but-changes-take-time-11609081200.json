    "body": "The coronavirus pandemic snarled the world’s sprawling supply chains for months, shutting factories, disrupting shipping and making it difficult for companies to get products from factories to consumers.<br />Now, many companies are considering changing the model to avoid future product shortages and transportation delays, even if it might increase costs. Some are looking at moving production closer to home. Others are considering spreading small factories around the world instead of putting all their manufacturing in one place.<br />There is little evidence of a big shift so far, given the costs and the uncertainty. But surveys and interviews with corporate executives show some have started to make changes and many are seriously considering them, though consultants say the moves could take several years to roll out.<br />Their decisions could ripple through the global economy, fueling growth in some places while curbing it in others. Prices for consumer goods could rise, as companies source from more expensive places. Higher inflation and interest rates could follow.<br />“If you go into a world of more diversified supply chains, which almost certainly will be less efficient…you could start to see inflationary pressures building,” said Shaun Roache, chief Asia-Pacific economist at S&P Global Ratings, who previously worked for the International Monetary Fund."
