    "body": "Global stock markets cratered when the first wave of Covid-19 infections shut down economies around the world. The current wave by some measures is worse, but markets have barely shrugged.<br />Partly that’s because with effective vaccines headed for approval, the end of the pandemic is in sight. But it also is because governments have tried to apply the lessons of the spring by imposing shorter and less stringent restrictions, or none at all. The economic hit has thus been smaller and more manageable.<br />“We’ve learned a whole lot in terms of how to deal with this pandemic,” Gita Gopinath, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said in an interview Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual summit.<br />She said the virus is being attacked “in a more targeted way”— Lockdowns are reserved for where cases are growing exponentially; higher-risk settings such as restaurants and bars are subject to limitations; and schools, which have proven relatively safe, stay open for the most part.<br />Still, targeted restrictions in Europe haven’t brought infections down as far as in the spring. The U.S. has yet to suffer much economic setback from its current wave, but its limited restrictions have yet to reverse the rise in infections."
