    "body": "WASHINGTON—White House communications director Alyssa Farah has resigned, a sign that Trump administration officials have begun to move on even as President Trump refuses to concede that he lost to President-elect Joe Biden.<br />“It’s been the honor of a lifetime to serve in the Trump Administration over the last 3 and a half years,” Ms. Farah, 31 years old, tweeted Thursday evening. Before joining the White House communications team in April, Ms. Farah served as a press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence and then served as press secretary at the Defense Department. Ms. Farah didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />Her departure comes as Mr. Trump continues to claim widespread fraud in the Nov. 3 presidential election, an allegation his legal team hasn’t substantiated in court. Key states have certified their results in favor of Mr. Biden. No evidence has surfaced of widespread fraud.<br />Ms. Farah worked closely with the White House coronavirus task force and on Thursday praised the speedy work on a vaccine.<br />Other administration staffers have been looking for jobs on Capitol Hill, with outside firms and Fox News, according to people familiar with the discussions."
