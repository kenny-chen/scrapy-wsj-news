    "body": "Scottsdale, Ariz.<br />The loud, boisterous house parties filled with drunk guests yelling endless profanities have stopped for now. Long-term renters, a couple from San Francisco and their dogs, have moved into the “hotel” next door.<br />Over the past few years  Airbnb  has grown up as a company. The global short-term rental platform has more than four million hosts in more than 200 countries, offices in 24 cities, and more than 2,000 employees. It has changed its practices to accommodate pandemic safety, cracked down on house parties, and set up a team to deal with issues that many neighbors of short-term rentals face daily. There’s now a 24/7 neighborhood support hotline.<br />Airbnb is set to go public Thursday, and I’ll be buying stock. My dad taught me  to invest in what I understand. After living next to a short-term rental for years, I have learned that people are always eager to unwind, relax and go on holiday. Now more than ever, many people, including me, are looking forward to traveling again once the pandemic is over.<br />If history repeats itself, the 2020s will be a big party much like the 1920s. Already many luxury travel companies are taking bookings for African safaris and trips to Antarctica through 2021 and 2022."
