    "body": "When coronavirus closed businesses in Baltimore and its suburbs in the spring, Kevin Benson feared the worst for the small lender he runs—widespread defaults, anemic loan growth.<br />Instead, Rosedale Federal Savings and Loan surpassed $1 billion in assets in May, years ahead of schedule, aided by a government-backed lending boom. The vast majority of its borrowers—consumers and businesses—are in good standing.<br />“We’re all pretty surprised by the resiliency,” said Mr. Benson, chief executive at Rosedale Federal. “It’s not time for a victory lap yet, but we’re cautiously optimistic.”<br />As 2020 draws to a close, small lenders like Rosedale are doing far better than expected at the outset of the coronavirus recession—largely thanks to government money that passed through banks on the way to households and businesses. Stimulus and unemployment checks boosted deposits and kept borrowers from falling behind on their loans. The Paycheck Protection Program—the government’s small-business bailout—brought them new customers and kept old ones afloat.<br />Profit at community banks—small, local lenders—jumped 10% in the third quarter from the same time last year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Total loans rose 13.4% in the third quarter, compared with 4.9% for the industry. Deposits surged 16.7%. Noncurrent loan rates have risen slightly this year but are still far below levels seen during the last financial crisis."
