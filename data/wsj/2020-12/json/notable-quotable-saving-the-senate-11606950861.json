    "body": "Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), who is retiring at the end of this term, speaking on the Senate floor Dec. 2:<br /><br />More than ever, our country needs a United States Senate to turn pluribus into unum, to lead the American struggle to forge unity from diversity. . . . Divided government offers an opportunity to share the responsibility—or the blame—for hard decisions, such as controlling the federal debt.<br />Now, some advocate another way to operate the Senate. End the filibuster, the Senate’s best-known tradition. Don’t worry about working across party lines. Pass everything with a majority vote.<br />Let the passions of the people roar through the Senate. If you’re a Democrat: Abolish right-to-work laws. Repeal limits on abortion. Pass restriction on guns."
