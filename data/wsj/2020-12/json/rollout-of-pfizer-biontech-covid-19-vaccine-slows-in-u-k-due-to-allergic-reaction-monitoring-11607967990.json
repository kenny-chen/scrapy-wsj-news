    "body": "LONDON—British doctors say rolling out the  Pfizer Inc. -BioNTech SE Covid-19 vaccine beyond hospitals will take longer than anticipated because of logistical challenges and complications thrown up by news in the U.K. of allergic reactions after the injection.<br />Following two severe allergic reactions on Dec. 8, the first day of the U.K. vaccination campaign last week, doctors were told to monitor patients for 15 minutes after each injection.<br />Logistical hiccups and the additional time required to monitor patients after a shot have added friction to an already-cumbersome immunization program and could signal challenges to come for the U.S. as health officials start vaccinating patients there.<br />Extra time required for observation means some U.K. doctors’ offices pulled out of the local vaccination campaign before it started Monday because they don’t have enough space to accommodate people in a socially distanced manner and still deliver the expected number of doses.<br />“You don’t necessarily get through as many people because you’ve got the 15 minutes” waiting time, said Ruth Rankine, primary care director at the NHS Confederation, the membership body representing health-care staff in the U.K.’s state-run National Health Service. Each shot takes around eight minutes to administer, according to NHS exercises in preparation for the vaccine."
