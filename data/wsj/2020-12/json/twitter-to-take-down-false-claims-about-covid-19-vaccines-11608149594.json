    "body": "Twitter  Inc.  is planning to remove posts that contain what it deems harmful or misleading information about Covid-19 vaccines, in the tech company’s latest effort to slow the spread of false claims related to the pandemic.<br />Twitter’s expanded policy announced Wednesday about misinformation follows the rollout of the distribution of vaccines that could end the pandemic but that need critical adoption to be broadly effective.<br />Under the new rules, Twitter said it would remove tweets that suggest vaccines are used to cause harm to populations; false claims that have been widely debunked about the adverse impacts of receiving vaccines; and posts that suggest Covid-19 isn’t serious and therefore doesn’t warrant a vaccine.<br />“We are focused on mitigating misleading information that presents the biggest potential harm to people’s health and well being,” Twitter said in a statement on Wednesday. Twitter plans to begin enforcing the new rules Dec. 21.<br />A large chunk of people in the U.S. get their news from social media. According to research conducted by the Harris Poll, more than 40% of Americans trust the information about the Covid-19 vaccines that they see on social-media platforms, and nearly 70% of Americans believe social-media platforms should aggressively monitor information on their sites about Covid-19 vaccines and remove any information they consider misleading."
