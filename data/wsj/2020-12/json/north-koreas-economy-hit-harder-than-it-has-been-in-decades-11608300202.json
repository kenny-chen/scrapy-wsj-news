    "body": "SEOUL—North Korea’s all-out push to halt the coronavirus has exacted a brutal blow to its already-tattered economy, contributing to a slide that will likely be the worst in a generation.<br />Pyongyang had little choice but to mount a heavy-handed defense. Its dilapidated health-care system left it vulnerable to the highly infectious disease.<br />But nearly a year into the pandemic, the pain caused by the Covid-19 measures has become visible. To ward off outbreaks, Pyongyang has locked down entire provinces and shut down foreign tourism—one of the regime’s last sources of outside income amid international sanctions.<br />Trade with China, the North’s main benefactor, has plunged 75% in 2020 versus the previous year, according to data from China’s customs office. It withered to less than $1.7 million in October, a 99% drop from the same month a year earlier.<br />North Korean exports of wigs, watches and shoes stopped that month, an official at the Seoul-based Korea International Trade Association said, as authorities on both sides of the border tried to minimize human contact. Pyongyang’s imports of food and medical equipment from China also ground to a halt in October, he said, citing Chinese traders and North Korean defectors."
