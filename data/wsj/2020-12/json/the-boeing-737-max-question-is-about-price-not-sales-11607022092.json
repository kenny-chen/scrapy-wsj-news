    "body": "Everything has its price.  Boeing ’s  chief concern is just how low it needs to be.<br />Two weeks after the Federal Aviation Administration approved the Boeing 737 MAX for passenger flights, the jet already has a big firm order on the table. On Thursday, European low-cost leader  Ryanair  confirmed that it would exercise the option to buy a further 75 units, on top of 135 previously ordered.<br />Shares in the Chicago-based plane maker, which has estimated the cost of the MAX debacle at around $20 billion, rose almost 8%. To meet scheduled production rates, the company needs to ship out the 450 MAX planes it has in storage, about 100 of which no longer have a prospective buyer and need to be remarketed.<br />Yet it shouldn’t be a surprise that the plane is selling again.<br />Because aircraft aren’t consumer products, even the biggest scandals are unlikely to push a model out of the market. The infamous McDonnell Douglas DC-10 carried passengers for decades after being grounded. Airlines facing any customer backlash could probably get away with subtle rebranding in fuselages and onboard safety cards. Ryanair labels its custom high-capacity MAX the “737-8200.”"
