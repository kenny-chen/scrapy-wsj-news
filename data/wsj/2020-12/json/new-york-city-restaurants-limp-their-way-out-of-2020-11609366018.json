    "body": "The Applebee’s locations in Times Square and nearby 50th Street are usually hopping on New Year’s Eve. Hundreds of people from all over the world fork over hundreds of dollars each to party in the chain restaurant before stepping outside to watch the ball drop.<br />This year, both restaurants will sit dark on Thursday, as they have since March. New Year’s Eve marks the latest in a long string of parties canceled this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />“It’s a big hole in my heart,” said Zane Tankel, chief executive of Apple-Metro, which operates the franchise’s New York City locations.<br />New Year’s Eve will be quieter in New York City this year, with public-health restrictions enacted to stop the spread of the coronavirus preventing restaurants, bars, hotels and other venues from hosting their usual gatherings. Indoor dining is prohibited, leaving restaurants limited to outdoor seating, delivery and takeout.<br />For those who do brave winter temperatures for outdoor dinner and drinks, the Champagne toast will come early, since bars and restaurants are under a 10 p.m. curfew for seated dining."
