    "body": "<br />NAPLES—For generations, the Christmas season has brought throngs of visitors to Via San Gregorio Armeno, a historic street in the heart of Naples where artisans have made the city’s famous handcrafted Nativity scenes since the 1800s.<br />In the run-up to the holiday, the narrow street usually becomes a kaleidoscope of colors, languages and elaborate figurines that mix religious references with modern-day touches.<br />This year, Via San Gregorio Armeno is largely deserted, with just a trickle of shoppers browsing the scores of stalls.<br />“It’s heartbreaking to see the street in this condition,” said Lidia Zito, a longtime Neapolitan resident, as she walked by a shuttered store."
