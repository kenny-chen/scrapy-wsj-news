    "body": "The 2020 Major League Soccer season—in its normal, pre-pandemic form—lasted less than two weeks before grinding to a halt. Teams in early March were barely two games in. NYC FC was still waiting for its first goal. Inter Miami hadn’t even broken out its home jerseys.<br />As it turned out, that was only a false start. What followed over the next nine months was the wildest schedule attempted by any professional sports league in America.<br />When resuming the regular season seemed impossible, MLS rushed back to the field before the NBA or Major League Baseball to play a brand new tournament, invented specifically for 2020, inside a bubble in Florida. Once that worked out, MLS doubled down. Not only would it pick up its regular season—it would send teams back to their home markets to finish the interrupted season. While they were at it, MLS tacked on a full playoff slate for them too.<br />By the time the 2020 season ends, after Saturday’s MLS Cup final between the Seattle Sounders and the Columbus Crew, the league will have somehow organized 324 games in the year of the pandemic.<br />“We had no sense whatsoever that we’d be able to pull that off,” MLS Commissioner Don Garber said this week, looking back on the longest season in the league’s 25-year history."
