    "body": "A curious email arrived after Saturday’s column, from a state official overseeing medical care for millions of Medicaid beneficiaries, including nursing-home inmates, in a state whose nursing-home deaths from Covid-19 are nothing to brag about.<br />I will withhold his name, but he said my column was “ill-informed,” “inaccurate” and “unscientific rubbish” without stating any claim that he was disagreeing with.<br />He suggested I had gotten my information from Steve Bannon and Ben Carson, though I mentioned neither man. Apparently because I cited a Senate hearing on treating early-stage Covid with a variety of drugs including hydroxychloroquine, he wrote: “I suggest if infected you pledge to stay home, take hydroxychloroquine, and not go to the hospital for more intensive treatment.”<br />This person is a medical doctor. I asked if he told statin users they should refuse treatment if they went on to develop severe coronary disease. No response, though he did acknowledge a list of sources I provided for every statement in my column.<br />I mention him because what rang through his email was histrionic, unreasoning denial of a highly representative sort. In reality, my column was a statement of the obvious, you might even say the culpably obvious. When a disease spreads more easily than the flu, by people with few or no symptoms, it will be “extremely difficult” to contain, to use the recent admission of Anthony Fauci."
