    "body": "More than a dozen Google services, including Gmail and YouTube, were offline in swaths of the globe Monday morning, interrupting access for both individuals and businesses.<br />The  Alphabet Inc. -owned company’s services showed errors for users attempting to sign in or access their emails or their files using Google’s Drive services, according to social-media postings from users. On YouTube, the home page was replaced with an illustration of a monkey with a hammer, with the title, “oops.”<br />A Google dashboard that displays the availability of Google services said that in addition to email and storage, apps including its calendar, videoconferencing tools, document-editing service and spreadsheets were offline as of 6:55 a.m. ET.<br />Service for the affected apps began to resume around 7:35 a.m.<br />The cause of the outage wasn’t immediately clear. A spokesman for Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
