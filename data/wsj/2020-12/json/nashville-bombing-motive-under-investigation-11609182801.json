    "body": "Investigators said Monday that they are still trying to determine what motivated suspected bomber Anthony Quinn Warner to blow up an RV in front of an  AT&T  facility in downtown Nashville, Tenn., on Christmas morning, killing himself and injuring three others.<br />David Rausch, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said his agency and others are following up on a number of leads, including that Mr. Warner’s father worked for AT&T.<br />“Interviews are still being conducted to determine, you know, if that plays in any whatsoever to the motive. At this point it’s all speculation,” Mr. Rausch said. Mr. Warner’s mother, he added, has been cooperating with authorities.<br />Earlier in the day, the agency released a criminal history for Mr. Warner that included a single arrest in 1978 by the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department for possession of marijuana for resale.<br />Mr. Rausch said tips from the public were key to identifying Mr. Warner, a 63-year-old from Antioch, Tenn., as the suspected bomber. One tip in particular, he said, gave investigators a name and led them to places to search for forensic evidence to match to tissue found at the site of the bombing. That tissue was analyzed by forensic scientists at the TBI, as well as at a Federal Bureau of Investigation lab at Quantico, Va."
