    "body": "NEW DELHI—Angry Indian workers broke windows and overturned cars at the office of a factory that makes iPhones and has often been touted by the government as an example of India’s efforts to boost manufacturing and lure companies looking to diversify away from China.<br />Indian television showed workers throwing stones, tossing office furniture and setting fire to a sign at  Wistron Corp.’s  operations near Bangalore. Labor leaders said workers at the Taiwanese-owned company that is a contract manufacturer for  Apple Inc.  were upset about wages and working hours.<br />Police said Sunday they had detained 100 people and were investigating the incident as well as claims by protesting workers that they hadn’t been paid.<br />A Wistron spokeswoman, Joyce Chou, said: “We follow the law and are supporting the authorities with their investigation.” She said the company was “deeply shocked” by the unrest. A spokesman for Apple in India declined to comment.<br />A top Indian union official, M.D. Harigovind, general secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress, blamed the unrest on what he called “the brutal exploitation of workers and sweatshop-like conditions” at the company."
