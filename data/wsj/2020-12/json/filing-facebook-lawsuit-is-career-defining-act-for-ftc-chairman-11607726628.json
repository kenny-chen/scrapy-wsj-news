    "body": "WASHINGTON—Joseph Simons has navigated an agitated White House, criticism from Congress and colleagues who are difficult to wrangle since becoming chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. The filing of the FTC’s antitrust lawsuit against  Facebook Inc.,  though, was a career-defining act.<br />Not that he wants any of the attention.<br />When the FTC and 46 states unveiled their tandem lawsuits against Facebook Wednesday afternoon, the commission held no press conference, and Mr. Simons said nothing at all. Instead, the FTC posted online a pre-recorded two-minute video by one of Mr. Simons’ deputies, who, with two model sailboats in the background, announced the case from his home.<br />The FTC lawsuit alleges Facebook engaged in an anticompetitive campaign to buy up and shut out rivals. The company rejects the claims as revisionist history and is preparing to battle the FTC in court. The case came on a 3-2 vote, with Mr. Simons, a Republican, joining two Democratic commissioners in the majority. The FTC’s other two GOP members voted no.<br />Mr. Simons, 62 years old, “is not flamboyant. He doesn’t stand up and claim credit. He did not take this job in order to get another job,” said George Washington University law professor William Kovacic, a former FTC chairman who previously worked with Mr. Simons at the commission. “I think he’s done a brilliant job in the hardest possible circumstances.”"
