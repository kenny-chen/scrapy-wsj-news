    "body": "Unilever  PLC said it would become the first major company to voluntarily give shareholders a vote on its efforts to reduce carbon emissions, seeking greater engagement with investors on climate issues.<br />The owner of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream said Monday it would seek approval from investors every three years on its plan to mitigate its carbon impact and the risks of climate change on its business. However, the vote would be only advisory and doesn’t require Unilever to make changes.<br />Major investors say they are putting more emphasis on addressing the threats posed by climate change, with shareholder resolutions on the issue becoming more common. By proposing its own climate resolutions for shareholders to vote on—which take into account the challenges and realities of achieving them—Unilever is in the driving seat, said one big investor.<br />BlackRock Inc.,  one of Unilever’s largest investors, said earlier this year that it would be increasingly likely to vote against management and boards if companies don’t disclose climate-change risks and plans in line with key industry standards.<br />Climate Action 100+, a group of large investors including BlackRock that is pressuring companies to act on climate change, welcomed Unilever’s announcement as meaningful."
