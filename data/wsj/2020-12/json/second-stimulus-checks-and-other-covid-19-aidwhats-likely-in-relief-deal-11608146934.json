    "body": "Democratic and Republican leaders are closing in on a coronavirus-aid deal, which is expected to include a second round of stimulus checks. Here is the latest on the negotiations, and what else could be in the package.<br />Congressional leaders were approaching agreement on a roughly $900 billion coronavirus-relief deal that includes another round of direct payments to households, along with aid for schools, vaccine distribution, unemployed workers and more. Congressional aides noted that the negotiations were continuing.<br />Leaders are working off a bipartisan group’s proposal that didn’t include funding for another round of direct payments that would reach most households. But congressional leaders were expected to add direct checks, and Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R., S.D.) told reporters Wednesday he expected the checks would be in the $600 to $700 range per person. That is less than the checks of $1,200 per person in the initial round earlier this year.<br />That earlier round of direct payments was estimated to cost $292 billion through 2021, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.<br />They are likely to be left out of this deal, after proving to be a sticking point in talks. Mr. Thune indicated that Democrats pushed to include the direct checks in exchange for dropping aid for state and local governments."
