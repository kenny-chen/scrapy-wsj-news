    "body": "Verizon Communications Inc.  and other cellphone providers are expected to spend billions of dollars to secure prized spectrum for their 5G networks in a U.S. government sale that kicks off Tuesday.<br />The Federal Communications Commission is launching a new auction for C-band airwaves, a stretch of wireless frequencies especially valued by companies trying to offer the fifth-generation service.<br />Typical bidders like Verizon,  AT&T Inc.  and  T-Mobile US Inc.  registered to participate. Cable, technology and investment companies also entered the contest, which could last several weeks.<br />“They all need to have a foot in the door,” said Davis Hebert, an analyst at debt research firm CreditSights. “C-band is going to be the cornerstone of 5G networks for the next decade.”<br />Wall Street analysts expect the auction to raise tens of billions of dollars over the coming weeks, a reflection of high demand. The frequencies sit in what telecom executives consider a “sweet spot” for 5G transmissions because they can move plenty of data quickly while still traveling long distances from a cellular tower."
