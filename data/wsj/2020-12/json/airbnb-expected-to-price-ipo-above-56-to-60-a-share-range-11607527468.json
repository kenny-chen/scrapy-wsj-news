    "body": "Airbnb Inc. is expected to price its shares above its already increased targeted range, according to people familiar with the matter, in yet another sign of exuberance in the IPO market.<br />Earlier this week, it boosted the targeted range to between $56 and $60 a share as investors express enthusiasm for the stock at a price above that range and as the stock market continues its march upward. The San Francisco home-rental startup is expected to set a price for its IPO Wednesday ahead of a trading debut Thursday.<br />The expected price indicates Airbnb would be valued at more than $42 billion based on a fully diluted share count and including proceeds of the offering, which is expected to raise in excess of $3.3 billion.<br />Airbnb’s executives and its underwriting team were closely watching the week’s other big IPO:  DoorDash Inc.’s  Wednesday trading debut. The San Francisco food-delivery company’s shares opened nearly 80% above their IPO price, which indicated a valuation of $39 billion on a fully diluted basis and including proceeds from the offering.<br />When Airbnb started its investor roadshow last week, the company established an initial per-share target range of $44 to $50. But it soon became clear that was too low."
