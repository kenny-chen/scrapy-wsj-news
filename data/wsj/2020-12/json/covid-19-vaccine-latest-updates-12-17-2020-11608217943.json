    "body": "The European Union intends to start vaccinating citizens against Covid-19 as soon as Dec. 27, days after its planned decision on whether to authorize  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ’s  shot.<br />The bloc has been criticized over the pace of its regulatory review of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is already being administered in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Saudi Arabia, despite being developed in Germany, an EU member.<br />European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted Thursday that a vaccine rollout would begin in the 27-country bloc on Dec. 27, 28 and 29. A spokesman for Mrs. von der Leyen later noted that the rollout date was conditional on approval from the EU’s top drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency.<br />Earlier this week, the EMA said it would advance its review of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after coming under pressure from some governments, setting a new date of Dec. 21 to decide on whether to authorize it. On Thursday, the EMA said that it would also accelerate its review of a  Moderna Inc.  vaccine, and would decide whether to authorize that shot on Jan. 6, instead of Jan. 12, as previously scheduled.<br />“We have been able to revise the timetables for the evaluation of the Covid-19 vaccines due to the incredible efforts of everybody involved in these assessments,” said EMA Executive Director Emer Cooke. “The number of infections is increasing across Europe and we are aware of the huge responsibility we have to get a vaccine to the market as quickly as is feasible.”"
