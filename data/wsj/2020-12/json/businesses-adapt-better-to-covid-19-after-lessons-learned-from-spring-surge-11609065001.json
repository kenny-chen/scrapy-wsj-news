    "body": "LONDON—In January, when British brewer Ralph Broadbent was preparing to launch a new fuss-free product for home brewing, he collided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, which delayed the arrival of injection molding tools he’d ordered from China.<br />By the time the tools arrived, a nationwide lockdown in the U.K. prompted him to cut the number of employees who could safely work in his warehouse to four from 20. He only launched his product, called The Pinter, in September.<br />This fall, by the time infections surged again, Mr. Broadbent added another bigger warehouse to allow employees to social distance and keep safe. The company, the Greater Good Fresh Brewing Co., was able to ship ingredients to make 50,000 pints of beer in one week.<br />“That was tricky, but nowhere near as tricky as the first time,” he said.<br />The resurgence in coronavirus infections throughout the West this fall has dealt a fresh blow to the global economy. But the impact is far less, thanks in part to lessons learned by businesses, particularly in manufacturing, about how to keep workers safe and continue operating. The resurgence of East Asian economies, particularly China, has also buoyed many Western manufacturers."
