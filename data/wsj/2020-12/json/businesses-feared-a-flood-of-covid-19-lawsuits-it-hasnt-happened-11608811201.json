    "body": "Nine months into the pandemic, an expected torrent of virus-related personal-injury lawsuits hasn’t materialized, as plaintiff attorneys find it more challenging than anticipated to hold a business responsible for spreading Covid-19.<br />Negligence lawsuits brought against businesses by infected customers are nearly nonexistent in state and federal courts, apart from a cluster of lawsuits targeting cruise lines. Even more rare are cases against smaller retailers and businesses, which the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had said were particularly vulnerable to financially crippling claims.<br />Existing laws have funneled most employee claims against employers into workers’ compensation systems, which don’t typically award the large sums sought by trial attorneys who can sue for pain and suffering in the courts.<br />Commercial litigators had braced their clients for a wave of negligence litigation. Back in April, the Chamber of Commerce warned its membership in April that Covid liability suits are “perhaps the largest area of concern for the overall business community.”<br />“In the beginning, we were concerned for our clients that this was going to spur a lot of personal-injury lawsuits,” said William Hubbard, a partner in the Cleveland law firm Thompson Hine which represents businesses. “The facts might just not be there for the cases.”"
