    "body": "China is exploring ways to combine two of its biggest industrial-chemical companies without running afoul of pledges made to the U.S. in 2016 during the $43 billion takeover of seed company Syngenta AG.<br />State-owned China National Chemical Corp., also known as ChemChina, may be placed under a new holding company together with Sinochem Group Co., according to people familiar with the matter. The new company would be overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission or Sasac, the Chinese body that holds state enterprises, the people said.<br />A combination would create the world’s largest chemicals conglomerate with the equivalent of more than $159 billion in annual revenue.<br />Placing ChemChina and Sinochem businesses under one holding company could also avoid triggering U.S. government scrutiny of Chinese ownership in Swiss agro-giant Syngenta, the people familiar with the matter said.<br />ChemChina and Sinochem didn’t respond to requests for comment."
