    "body": "In “Hunting Aims for a Comeback in Locked-Down Michigan” (Cross Country, Nov. 28), Megan Keller notes that hunters are conservationists of a sort, as wildlife agencies use hunting to control wildlife populations that no longer have normal predators. Not mentioned is that the sale of hunting licenses, tags and stamps is also the primary source of funding for state wildlife agencies.
