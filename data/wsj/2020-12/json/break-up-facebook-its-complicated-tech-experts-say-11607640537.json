    "body": "Breaking up  Facebook Inc.  would be difficult and expensive, but not impossible, according to current and former employees along with tech-industry experts.<br />In separate antitrust lawsuits filed on Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of 46 state attorneys general said they would try to make Facebook divest itself of apps Instagram and WhatsApp if the company’s conduct is found to be illegal.<br />Should that push succeed, it would rank among the biggest breakups in corporate history alongside Standard Oil and  AT&T .  Yet a breakup would also be complex, requiring potentially years of engineering work on top of legal wrangling.<br />Months before the FTC suit, Facebook called divestment of the apps “a complete nonstarter” in a briefing document, saying that disentangling them would result in diminished products, weaker security for user data and billions of dollars in redundant spending.<br />In a memo sent to employees on Wednesday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the lawsuits would take years to play out, and said he believed the company would prevail in court."
