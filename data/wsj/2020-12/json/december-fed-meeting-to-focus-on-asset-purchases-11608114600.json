    "body": "WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials resume deliberations Wednesday about how to communicate their plans to support the economy with large-scale bond buying.<br />The central bank in September updated its guidance about how long its officials expect to hold interest rates near zero. Since then, officials have turned their focus to refining an asset-purchase program that began in March to stabilize market functioning and now are focused on stimulating economic growth.<br />The Fed will release its policy statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time along with new economic projections. Chairman Jerome Powell will follow with a press conference at 2:30 p.m., at which he could explain any new policy changes or guidance.<br />Here’s what to watch:<br />At their meeting last month, Fed officials suggested they should provide updated guidance “fairly soon” about how long they expect to continue buying Treasury and mortgage securities."
