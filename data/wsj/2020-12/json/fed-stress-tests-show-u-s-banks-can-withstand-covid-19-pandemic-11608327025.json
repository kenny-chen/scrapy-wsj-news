    "body": "The Federal Reserve said Friday that the largest U.S. banks remain strong enough to survive the coronavirus crisis but warned that a prolonged economic downturn could saddle them with hundreds of billions of dollars in losses on soured loans.<br />The Fed also said it would allow the banks to restart share buybacks but that it would, at least in the first quarter, restrict the amount. It said it would continue to restrict dividend payouts.<br />Under two hypothetical scenarios, in which unemployment remains high and the economy doesn’t bounce back for several quarters, the 33 largest U.S. banks could be hit with as much as $600 billion in loan losses, the Fed said in the latest iteration of its stress test. That would erode the capital buffers meant to keep them on sound financial footing, the central bank said.<br />Designed to gauge the health of the nation’s banks, the stress tests were expanded this year to study the effect of the downturn brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Earlier this year, the Fed placed restrictions on the biggest banks’ dividend payouts and share buybacks, a move to preserve capital in an unsettled economy. At that time, the Fed stopped all buybacks and said dividends couldn’t exceed a bank’s recent profits. The Fed in September extended the restrictions through the end of this year."
