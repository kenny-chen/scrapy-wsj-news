    "body": "Tina Müller thought she had found a way out of the lockdown.<br />Before German authorities shut down all nonessential shops this month, the chief executive of the perfume chain Douglas saw that some rivals with similar offerings would be able to stay open because they were classified as drugstores rather than perfumeries.<br />So, on the lockdown’s first day earlier this month, Ms. Müller pronounced Douglas a drugstore and threw open its doors in shopping malls and high streets across Germany. The political and media condemnation was swift and scathing. Douglas shut its stores the next day and issued an apology.<br />“Our decision to keep some stores with drugstore products open was incomprehensible to many people,” Ms. Müller wrote on her  Twitter  feed. “All of our German stores will remain closed from today until further notice. We apologize to those who feel offended by our actions.”<br />The short-lived experiment was just one of the most high-profile examples of how businesses, from large corporations to mom-and-pop diners and even brothels, have been scanning lockdown orders for loopholes to maintain some activity."
