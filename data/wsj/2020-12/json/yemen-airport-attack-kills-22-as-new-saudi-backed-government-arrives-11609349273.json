    "body": "An attack on an airport in Yemen killed at least 22 people moments after members of the country’s newly sworn-in cabinet arrived, the latest blow to a country struggling to emerge from a devastating conflict.<br />The sound of explosions followed by gunfire shook the airport in the city of Aden, sending people running across the runway, according to news footage of the attack reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The blasts took place moments after cabinet ministers from a government backed by Saudi Arabia had landed from Riyadh. The government’s information minister said all the members of the cabinet were safe following the attack. A deputy minister of public works was killed in the attack, officials said.<br />“The cowardly terrorist act that targeted Aden airport is part of the war being waged against the Yemeni state and our great people, and it will only deepen our resolve to fulfill our duties” said Maeen Abdulmalek Saeed, the prime minister in the new government, in a tweet.<br />The Yemeni interior ministry affiliated with the Saudi-backed government said 22 people were killed in the attack and more than 50 wounded. The local branch of Doctors Without Borders, the international medical relief charity, said it was preparing for a “mass casualty” event."
