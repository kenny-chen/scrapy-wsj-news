    "body": "China has declared victory in its campaign against online peer-to-peer lenders, a risky financing sector that has been zeroed out, a top banking regulator said this week.<br />Peer lenders gather funds from small investors and loan them out to small businesses and individuals. At first loosely regulated, they were seen as a financial innovation serving parts of the Chinese financial system that were ignored by state-backed banks. But a wave of scandals and defaults in 2018 prompted authorities to crack down.<br />At one point, China had more than 5,000 peer-to-peer lenders in operation, said Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and annual transaction volume totaling the equivalent of about $459 billion.<br />“While they were originally positioned as financial-information intermediaries, the vast majority of them have in fact carried out credit and wealth-management business,” he said Tuesday at the Singapore Fintech Festival.<br />However, Mr. Guo added: “We have continued to clean up and consolidate, and by mid-November the actual operating P2P lenders had all been zeroed out.” As of June, previous official statistics showed 29 were still operating."
