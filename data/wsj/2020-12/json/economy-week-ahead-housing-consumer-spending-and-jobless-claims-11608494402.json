    "body": "The holiday-shortened week offers an array of data likely to confirm the U.S. economic recovery is slowing.<br />MONDAY<br />A monthly survey of eurozone households is expected to record a weakening of sentiment in the early weeks of December, as worries about rising coronavirus infections and the prospect of a lengthening period of restrictions outweigh the boost to optimism from the availability of effective vaccines.<br />TUESDAY<br />U.S. existing-home sales rose to a 14-year high in October, spurred on by low mortgage rates and a quest for more space.
