    "body": "SÃO PAULO—Gunmen armed with explosives sowed terror overnight in a small city in northern Brazil, taking petrified residents hostage and using them as human shields as they robbed a bank. It was the second such attack by bank robbers in Brazil in two days.<br />Carrying military-style weapons, the gang of about 15 men descended on Cametá, a sleepy riverside city of 134,000 people in the Amazon on Tuesday night, killing one resident and injuring another in the 2½-hour attack.<br />“Cametá had never seen something like this,” said Mauricio Melo Mendes Monteiro, the head of the city’s military police force in Pará state.<br />The siege came a day after a gang of 30 heavily armed bank robbers invaded the small city of Criciuma more than 2,000 miles to the south, leaving cash scattered on the city’s streets as they fled the scene. Security experts said it was unlikely to be the same gang, but said it wasn’t clear if they are connected.<br />In Tuesday night’s raid, armed men first targeted Cametá’s military police station, preventing the officers from leaving while the rest of the gang broke into a bank."
