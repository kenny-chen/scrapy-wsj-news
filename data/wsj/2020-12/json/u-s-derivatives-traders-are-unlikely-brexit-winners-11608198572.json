    "body": "In the tug of war Brexit has unleashed between London and other European financial centers, one potential winner is often forgotten: the U.S.<br />More European capital-markets business is done in London than in any other city. Some of that activity will have to move after the end of this year, when transitional arrangements agreed at the time of Britain’s departure from the European Union expire.<br />This doesn’t depend on the trade deal currently under negotiation. Hopes of a positive outcome have buoyed sterling this week, and an agreement is crucial for goods industries with complex supply chains, such as autos and food. But a deal that preserves anything like the status quo in financial services isn’t on the table.<br />That means U.K.-based financial institutions will lose their “passports” to transact freely in the EU on Dec. 31, while EU companies won’t be able to deal as freely in London. The change will fragment liquidity and add cost and complexity for all manner of operations that in recent decades have settled in London.<br />Among the few beneficiaries will likely be U.S. derivatives exchanges that are authorized by both jurisdictions."
