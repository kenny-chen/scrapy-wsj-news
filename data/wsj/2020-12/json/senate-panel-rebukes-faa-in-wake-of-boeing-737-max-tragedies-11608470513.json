    "body": "A congressional panel issued a report documenting what it determined were safety-oversight lapses by the Federal Aviation Administration, from agency intimidation of federally protected whistleblowers to lax policing of maintenance errors.<br />The 101-page document, released Friday by the Senate Commerce committee, is sharply critical of FAA leadership’s handling of numerous matters over several years. The findings stem from the broadest review of agency enforcement efforts conducted in the wake of two fatal crashes of  Boeing Co. ’s 737 MAX jets.<br />Concluding that systemic FAA deficiencies pose an “unnecessary risk to the flying public,” the report cited a pattern of agency managers avoiding responsibility for failures to ensure proper staff training. Managers also undermined or overruled enforcement decisions of some inspectors, investigators determined.<br />“When inspectors pushed back,” according to the report, “they were investigated and in some cases reassigned.”<br />After examining some 13,000 pages of documents and interviewing dozens of agency employees, investigators described a “failed FAA safety management culture” tending to favor companies over FAA staff and “often accompanied by retaliation against those who report safety violations.”"
