    "body": "From a Dec. 13 editorial in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette:<br /><br />Each morning NPR does a five-minute news podcast, as do Fox News and other news organizations. Last week, while listening to NPR, we heard this: “President Trump continues to lie, saying he won the election, and that fraud was rampant . . .”<br />President Trump certainly wouldn’t be the first president to lie to the American people. And he probably won’t be the last. But he probably is the first American president to be called a liar by so many large mainstream news organizations in their news accounts.<br />Not just National Public Radio, either. The  New York Times  uses the word “lie” and “liar” referring to Trump in its headlines. When the newspaper of record does this, it is cheered by all those who despise Donald Trump. And the divide among Americans gets even deeper."
