    "body": "In what was either expensive political point-scoring or an absolute steal in the energy market, the first federal leases for oil and gas development in California in eight years were auctioned on Thursday.<br />The Trump administration announced plans last year to auction leases on about a million acres of federal land in California, setting off a flurry of legal challenges in the environmentally conscious state. In the end it came down to just 4,133 acres in Kern County, where there are existing oil fields. The Bureau of Land Management estimated that up to 10 wells could be drilled on the newly leased parcels.<br />Taxpayers didn’t get much for all the trouble—only $53,562, the price of less than 1,200 barrels of crude. That could be an amazing deal for the companies that purchased the leases, even after paying rent plus royalties on any oil produced. Federal leases adjacent to producing properties have fetched prices 30 or more times as much per acre.<br />The purchases are a bet that legal challenges won’t stop development. President-elect Joe Biden has said he will ban new leases on public lands; so there also could be attempts to reverse such deals, but the buyers would largely be made whole. They may annoy some government officials, and ultimately the purchasers don’t have much to lose.<br />Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com"
