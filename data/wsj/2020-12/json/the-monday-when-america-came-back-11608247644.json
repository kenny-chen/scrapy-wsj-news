Didn’t he used to be someone?<br />But wait, look. He’s not walking, he’s marching. Like he’s got his old strut back. As if he just remembered who he is.<br />That was the picture that came to mind on Monday. We were like America of old. And I’m not sure we’re fully seeing it. But on that day our Constitution did what it was built to do, prevail. And our scientific genius and spirit of invention asserted themselves as national features that still endure.<br />So here’s to you, Dec. 14, 2020. You provided a very good ending to a very bad year.<br />On that day the winner of the 2020 election was formally declared president-elect by the Electoral College. This would normally be a formality, but this year it had—let’s call it deeper than usual resonance. Presidential electors met and voted throughout the day in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The vote was 306-232. It was done as in the past, in an orderly manner without great incident."
