    "body": "A recent climb in the price of cocoa is fueling tensions between West African growers and candy makers including  Hershey Co.  and Mars Inc. about measures intended to guarantee farmers a living wage.<br />Producers say that major buyers have made large purchases to circumvent a $400-a-ton surcharge on cocoa from the region that aims to lock in better margins for impoverished farmers, while cutting down on deforestation and child labor. The premium, which was introduced last year, is set to take effect in the 2020-2021 growing season.<br />The producers include representatives of the cocoa industries in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which sell around 61% of the world’s cocoa supply, according to data from the International Cocoa Organization. “In breach of faith, some chocolatiers and trade houses have adopted covert strategies to circumvent the farmer income improvement mechanism with the aim of collapsing it,” they said in a recent statement.<br />A spokeswoman for Mars said the company wasn’t trying to circumvent the cocoa premium. “Mars Wrigley categorically disagrees with any allegation that it has changed its cocoa-buying practices to avoid payment of the [living income differential],” she said.<br />A spokesman for Hershey said the company doesn’t comment on specific details of purchases, but Hershey sometimes bases its decisions “on hedging pricing fluctuations in the market and…ensuring sufficient supply to meet our needs well into the future, especially in times of uncertainty.”"
