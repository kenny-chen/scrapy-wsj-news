    "body": "Jersey City officials say they have trained police and engaged communities to guard against future incidents of domestic terrorism after a mass shooting targeted the city’s Jewish community one year ago.<br />Two shooters went on an hourslong rampage in the city’s Greenville section on Dec. 10, 2019, besieging a kosher grocery store and getting into firefights with police that killed four people, including a police officer, and the two perpetrators.<br />The assailants, David Anderson and Francine Graham, used high-powered rifles in their attack and had originally intended to strike a Jewish day school near the grocery, officials said. A van driven by Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham was found to contain an undetonated pipe bomb. Officials said the two had planned the attack for months while traveling and living in Bayonne, N.J., and Ohio, and had a history of making statements against police and Jewish people.<br />Mayor Steven Fulop, who is Jewish, said in an interview that the incident left deep wounds across the city, traumatizing Jewish residents, members of law enforcement and members of the city’s Black community.<br />In the months since the attack, city officials have worked to counter anti-Semitism and strengthen tactical preparedness, Mr. Fulop said, by holding meetings with community leaders and residents, and implementing training for officers."
