    "body": "As a longtime fan, I find it ironic that Bob Dylan sold his entire publishing catalog, likely worth hundreds of millions of dollars (“Dylan Sells Catalog to Universal,” Business & Finance, Dec. 8). I remember so well some of those early songs with an antiestablishment theme of protest. Mr. Dylan now deservedly reaps the benefits of his incredible creativity from the capitalist system that he wasn’t so sure about back in 1963. What a country!<br />Walt Rose<br />San Anselmo, Calif.<br /><br />Mr. Dylan’s sale goes to show that even progressive liberals are fiscal conservatives with their own money."
