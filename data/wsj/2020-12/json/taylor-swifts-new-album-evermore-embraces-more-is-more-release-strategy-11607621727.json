    "body": "For Taylor Swift fans, Christmas is coming early: Ms. Swift on Thursday announced her ninth studio album, “Evermore,” which is the second unexpected release of the year for one of music’s most notoriously meticulous pop stars.<br />Released just five months after her intimate Grammy-nominated blockbuster “Folklore,” the new album, which Ms. Swift describes as “folklore’s sister record,” features many of the same collaborators, including The National’s Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff and Bon Iver. That continuity suggests a collection of “Folklore” leftovers and more songs written in a similarly hushed and folksy indie-rock vein.<br />“I’ve never done this before,” Ms. Swift said on social media. “In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore.”<br />“I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales,” she continued. “So I just kept writing them.”<br />The quick arrival of “Evermore” reflects a reality of today’s streaming-music economy: More is more. Like fellow pop star Ariana Grande, Ms. Swift has pivoted from carefully plotted-out releases to more spontaneous and less precious ones—borrowing from the playbook of hip-hop & R&B stars."
