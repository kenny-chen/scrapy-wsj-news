    "body": "BERLIN—For years, Victoria Bergstrom has been waiting for this moment, a rite of passage, finally to be 21 years old and able take part in the family tradition of drinking a glass of Swedish Glögg together on Christmas Day.<br />But this isn’t exactly how the American student imagined it. Instead of sitting together around the Christmas tree in Portsmouth, R.I., opening presents and nipping at a cup of hot, spiced wine, she is stuck at college in the Netherlands, and plans to join the family ritual in a video chat, thousands of miles away because of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Ms. Bergstrom’s parents are elderly, the prime risk group for contracting Covid-19, and her father isn’t in good health. So, she decided to not return home for Christmas to avoid unwittingly bringing the coronavirus with her.<br />“I could go home, but I won’t because I don’t want to put my parents at risk,” Ms. Bergstrom says. “I would rather spend one holiday and not see my family and get 10 or 15 more in the future.”<br />Usually at this time of year, millions of students in college towns all around the world put away their books and make the journey to celebrate the holidays with family. But the pandemic has cast a shadow over the traditional homecoming."
