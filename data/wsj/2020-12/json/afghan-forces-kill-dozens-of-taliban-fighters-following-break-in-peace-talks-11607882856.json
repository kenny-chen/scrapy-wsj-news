    "body": "Afghan government security forces killed at least 51 Taliban fighters in the southern province of Kandahar, the latest flare-up in violence as the two sides pursue peace talks in Qatar while simultaneously competing for territory at home.<br />The Afghan ministry of defense said the strikes against Taliban positions in five districts on Saturday night, a mixture of ground and air assaults that also destroyed four Taliban ammunition depots, were in response to insurgent attacks.<br />A delegation comprising the army, provincial police and the Kandahar governor were also investigating allegations from local residents that government airstrikes had killed civilians in Arghandab district, the ministry said. The Taliban said 13 civilians had been killed in an airstrike, while a spokesman for the provincial governor said seven civilians had died after the Taliban detonated explosives laden into a Humvee.<br />Col. Sonny Leggett, spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement that the U.S. had conducted a strike against the Taliban in support of Afghan forces in a different district, adding that the Taliban claim of civilian casualties was false.<br />A video filmed by a local resident in Arghandab, and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, showed the bodies of 11 people, including at least seven children."
