    "body": "Chevron Corp.  said it would cut its annual capital spending budget by 26% next year and sharply through the middle of the decade, as the coronavirus pandemic forces an industrywide reappraisal of fossil-fuel investment.<br />Chevron said it would spend $14 billion in 2021 and between $14 billion and $16 billion a year through 2025. It previously said it would spend $19 billion to $22 billion a year through 2024 before the pandemic, while returning as much as $80 billion to shareholders over that period.<br />The reductions by the U.S. oil giant follow those announced this week by rival  Exxon Mobil Corp. , which on Monday said it was reducing its yearly capital spending by about $5 billion to $10 billion each year through 2025. Exxon, which has lost more than $2.3 billion over the first three quarters of this year, also said it would slash the book value of its assets by up to $20 billion.<br />Chevron has lost nearly $5 billion this year, but unlike Exxon has managed to avoid taking on large amounts of new debt due to a relatively strong balance sheet. The company’s share price is down about 5% over the last six months and closed at $89.87 Wednesday.<br />“Chevron remains committed to capital discipline with a 2021 capital budget and longer-term capital outlook that are well below our prior guidance,” Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said."
