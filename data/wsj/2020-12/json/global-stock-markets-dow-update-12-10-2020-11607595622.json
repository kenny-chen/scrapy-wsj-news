    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged down Thursday as fresh data showed unemployment claims jumped sharply last week.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked 0.3% lower, suggesting the broad-market index is on track for muted gains after the opening bell. Nasdaq-100 futures slid 0.6%, pointing to a second day of declines for tech stocks after Facebook was hit by a series of antitrust lawsuits.<br />Applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, rose sharply to 853,000 last week. It was more than economists had forecast. Separately, data also showed that consumer prices in November ticked up by 0.2%.<br />“Today’s increase in initial jobless claims is another sign economic momentum may be fading,” said Richard Flynn, a managing director at Charles Schwab.<br />The dimming economic picture may make it more imperative for Congress to pass a fresh fiscal-stimulus spending bill that would support businesses and households through the economic downturn, he said. Lawmakers have broadly agreed with the White House that the aid package should total around $900 billion, but key points of contention remain. A bipartisan group continued to negotiate late Wednesday."
