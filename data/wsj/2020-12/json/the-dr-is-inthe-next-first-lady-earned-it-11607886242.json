    "body": "Joseph Epstein’s op-ed (“Is There a Doctor in the White House? Not if You Need an M.D.,” Dec. 12) reeks of sour grapes. He tells readers about all he has accomplished without any type of advanced degree, including that he was an educator for 30 years. So was I, and I admire Dr. Jill Biden for having obtained her Ed.D. She has a right to be proud of her personal achievements and use “Dr.” in front of her name. She is also a role model who was able to take on family responsibilities as well as advanced academic responsibilities. In this day and age, Mr. Epstein’s article comes across as a put-down, an attempt to diminish the achievements of a woman who is to be respected and admired.<br />Renee Fishman<br />Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.<br /><br />Most of Mr. Epstein’s complaints about higher education seem to lie with the silly practice of bestowing honorary doctorates, which is entirely beside the point. What Mr. Epstein does have to say about academics has far more to do with self-seriousness than the value of the research they are producing. If he takes issue with the quality of Dr. Biden’s dissertation, let him make that argument on the substance rather than belittling her field, dissertation topic and degree-granting institution."
