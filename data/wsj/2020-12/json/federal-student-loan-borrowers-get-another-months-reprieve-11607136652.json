    "body": "The Trump administration said Friday it will allow most borrowers with federal student loans to suspend their monthly payments until Jan. 31, 2021, extending by a month an earlier reprieve designed to support households during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The decision, announced by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, will help most of the 42 million Americans who owe federal student loans.<br />“The coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges for many students and borrowers, and this temporary pause in payments will help those who have been impacted,” Mrs. DeVos said. She added that Congress, rather than the administration, should determine what, if any, additional relief should be provided to student-loan borrowers.<br />The move will allow tens of millions of borrowers to go another month without having to pay hundreds—and in some cases, thousands—of dollars in student-loan payments. Instead, taxpayers will cover the cost of foregone interest on those loans.<br />Most borrowers with federal student loans haven’t had to make payments since March, when the pandemic led swaths of the economy to close."
