    "body": "WASHINGTON—California on Friday filed court papers seeking to join the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google.<br />The Justice Department and a group of 11 state attorneys general, all Republicans, filed the case on Oct. 20 alleging Google uses anticompetitive tactics to preserve a monopoly for its flagship search engine and related advertising business.<br />The company denies the allegations. “People use Google because they choose to, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives,” a Google spokeswoman said Friday. “We’re confident in our position and we’ll continue to make our case in court.”<br />California would be the first Democratic-led state to join the case. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s office didn’t respond to questions about why it decided to join the suit now.<br />Mr. Becerra’s move could help placate Republican critics as he seeks confirmation next year as President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services."
