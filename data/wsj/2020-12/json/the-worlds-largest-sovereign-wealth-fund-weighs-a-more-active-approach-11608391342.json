    "body": "Nicolai Tangen made his name picking stocks in the cloistered world of hedge funds. Now he is sparring over an active approach to running the world’s largest sovereign-wealth fund—historically a bastion of passive investing.<br />Mr. Tangen—three months in as chief executive of Norges Bank Investment Management, the arm of the Norwegian central bank that operates the fund—says active management boosts investment returns and lays the groundwork for interacting with companies. Purists say stock picking is a waste of money and returns at the 10.838 trillion Norwegian kroner fund, equivalent to $1.265 trillion, would hold up fine without it.<br />Established in the 1990s to invest revenues from oil discoveries, the oil fund, as it is known, is now worth three times the country’s annual gross domestic product and safeguards wealth for the future.<br />“Norwegians really feel it’s their money, and they really care who runs it,” Mr. Tangen said in an interview.<br />Now the years-old debate has bubbled up again, with Mr. Tangen himself weighing in. The core of the dispute: how integral active asset management should be to the strategy of the sovereign-wealth fund."
