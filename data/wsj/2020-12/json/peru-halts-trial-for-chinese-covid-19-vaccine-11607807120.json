    "body": "LIMA, Peru—Peru’s Health Ministry said Saturday it has suspended a trial for a Chinese Covid-19 vaccine after a participant presented health problems.<br />The Healthy Ministry said a trial with 12,000 volunteers for China’s  Sinopharm  vaccine has been temporarily put on hold as it investigates whether the vaccine caused what it described as a “serious adverse event” in one of the participants. The trial was expected to finish in the coming days.<br />Germán Málaga, a health researcher at the Cayetano Heredia University in Lima, where the trial is taking place, said a volunteer presented neurological problems, resulting in difficulty moving his legs. Dr. Málaga told radio station RPP Noticias that he didn’t believe the health problem was due to the vaccine, but more information was needed.<br />“We are concerned about the situation, and we are providing all of our help and support to ensure that it is cleared up,” he said.<br />The United Arab Emirates said this week that its own trial for the Sinopharm vaccine had shown that it was 86% effective in protecting people from Covid-19."
