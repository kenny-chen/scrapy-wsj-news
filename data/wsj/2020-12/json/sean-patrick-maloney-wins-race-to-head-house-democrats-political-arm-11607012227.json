    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Democrats selected New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney to lead the caucus through its next campaign cycle, choosing a chairman who represents the types of districts the party will need to win to expand its narrow majority.<br />Mr. Maloney won the race on Thursday, beating California Rep. Tony Cárdenas to chair the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee, which oversees the strategy for the party’s House elections.<br />The vote total was 119 for Mr. Maloney and 107 for Mr. Cárdenas.<br />The soon-to-be five-term lawmaker campaigned on courting voters whom the party failed to reach in the 2020 cycle, including more conservative voters, saying he was aptly positioned to do so because he represents a district that President Trump won in 2016. He also plans to appoint people to look at Latino outreach and recruiting women to run for office.<br />Mr. Maloney has analyzed the party’s losses before. When Democrats were shocked at Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 and other party losses that year, Mr. Maloney analyzed the DCCC’s operations. He said that helped the party win the House majority two years later."
