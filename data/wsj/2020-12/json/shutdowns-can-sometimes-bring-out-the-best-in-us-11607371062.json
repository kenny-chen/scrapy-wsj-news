    "body": "In response to “In a Stay-at-Home Pandemic, Sportswriter Finds a Silver Lining” (Sports, Nov. 27): I had the opportunity just before Thanksgiving to work side by side with a new pastor of social justice at the church I attend. We were co-leading activities to collect, pack and distribute ingredients for 425 families’ Thanksgiving dinner. When all the other volunteers had left and she and I were in the room alone, she looked at me and confessed, “I feel guilty, but this has been a good year for me. Being stuck at home has forced me to go on a life diet—to learn what’s important and to shed the rest of my life’s baggage.”<br />I had to admit that I’ve felt the same way this year. As the world started to shut down in February and people around me were starting to panic, I vowed to stay positive, to apply creativity and flexibility to challenges, to tackle long-neglected projects and to finally learn to use time wisely. It has been a year of learning, giving, challenges and faith. It has been a year I would not trade for all the world.<br />Noel Haskins-Hafer<br />La Mesa, Calif."
