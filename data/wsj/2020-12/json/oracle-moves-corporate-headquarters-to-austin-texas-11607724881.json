    "body": "Oracle Corp.  said it has changed its corporate headquarters to Austin, Texas, the latest high-profile defection from Silicon Valley.<br />The company and its founder and chairman, Larry Ellison, are pillars of the Bay Area. Oracle’s name adorns the stadium home of pro baseball’s San Francisco Giants. Mr. Ellison is known for his lavish homes in the region.<br />Oracle, which was founded in Santa Clara, Calif., in 1977, most recently had its headquarters up the road in Redwood City. The software giant and Silicon Valley stalwart said the relocation was part of an effort to have a more flexible approach to its workforce.<br />Oracle joins others in leaving the region that for decades has been synonymous with America’s tech industry.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.  earlier this month said it was moving its headquarters to the Houston area.  Palantir Technologies Inc.,  founded in the Bay Area in 2003, moved its headquarters to Denver this year. Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, a venture capitalist, moved to Austin this year.<br />Many of the executives that are turning their back on Silicon Valley share conservative political views and, at times, have taken issue with what they regard as the region’s liberal politics. Two prominent conservative venture capitalists, Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, have cited what they see as Silicon Valley’s political leanings as reasons to relocate."
