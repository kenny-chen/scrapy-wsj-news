    "body": "William McGurn is disturbed by “The Silence of Pope Francis” (Main Street, Dec. 8) with regard to China’s arrest of Jimmy Lai, Hong Kong’s most well-known Catholic layman and champion of democracy.<br />Pragmatism may account for Pope Francis rendering unto China some authority over the church that traditionally is rendered unto God, but his approach fits a pattern. It may be that you can take a pope out of Argentina, but you can’t take Argentina out of a pope. Argentina has been infatuated with populist politics, democratic socialism and social justice for a century. A serial defaulter, Argentina periodically blames greedy capitalist lenders for the nation’s borrowing addiction and informs them that they don’t deserve to be repaid in full.<br />China’s communism was never perceived as a serious threat to Argentina, but greedy capitalists in the West were. Supposedly they were sucking the lifeblood out of the country. In this view, social justice is more important than one Hong Kong media mogul thrown in jail for trying to preserve Western-style freedoms.<br />Chris Davis<br />Jacksonville, Fla."
