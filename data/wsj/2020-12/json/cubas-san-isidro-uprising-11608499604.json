    "body": "In a telephone interview last week I asked Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara, one of the leaders of the dissident San Isidro Movement in Havana, what he thinks of Fidel Castro.<br />His answer stunned me not because I disagreed but because challenging the godlike myth of the comandante, alive or dead, has always been taboo.<br />“For me he was a bad person, and what he did is not justified by what he did in things like health care,” the 33-year-old performance artist said. “If you repress someone because they wrote a poem you don’t like or you arrest young people continually, you are not a good person. This repression has destroyed the lives of intellectuals.”<br />Lots of Cubans will tell you similar things privately, but few have dared utter them in public. Until now.<br />The San Isidro Movement was formed in 2018 to oppose a new law making it a crime to engage in performance art without permission from the Ministry of Culture. The group—made up of young adults of different races who are artists, writers, musicians, students, and researchers—hold a mix of political views but are united in their quest for freedom."
