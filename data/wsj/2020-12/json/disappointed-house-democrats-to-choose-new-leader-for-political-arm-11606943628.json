    "body": "WASHINGTON—Two House Democrats are locked in a tight race to run the political arm of the caucus after a weak showing in the November election ignited finger pointing and a reassessment of how the party can win over more centrist and Latino voters.<br />Democrats on Thursday are poised to choose between New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, who represents a district President Trump won in 2016, and California Rep. Tony Cárdenas, who has spent the past six years leading the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.<br />The race between a Latino member of Congress and a lawmaker in a Trump district to run the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is emblematic of the two groups where House Democrats fell short in the 2020 cycle.<br />Democrats failed to win enough white voters in suburban swing districts, and underperformed expectations among Latino voters in Florida, Texas and California. Instead of picking up targeted seats, they lost some of the ground they had gained in 2018, when they won back the majority.<br />“What we had happen in this last election, if we don’t fix it, then two years from now, we might be in the minority,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.)."
