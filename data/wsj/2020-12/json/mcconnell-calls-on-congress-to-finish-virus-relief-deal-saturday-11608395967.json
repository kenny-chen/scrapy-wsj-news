    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate leaders from both parties called on the other to compromise Saturday in the final round of negotiations over a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, saying they hoped to complete an agreement later in the day.<br />On Friday night, both chambers passed a two-day spending patch, signed into law by President Trump, to keep the government funded through Sunday while negotiations continued. The previous deadline had been 12:01 a.m. Saturday.<br />Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said lawmakers were still negotiating Saturday over the last stumbling block: a push from Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) to restrict the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending powers.<br />“Sen. Toomey’s legislation creates barriers to emergency lending that go far beyond current law,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor Saturday. “It’s about tying the hands of the next Treasury secretary and the next Fed chairman in a true emergency.”<br />Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Democratic leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had productive discussions all week and urged lawmakers to conclude their negotiations. He didn’t specifically discuss the Toomey proposal."
