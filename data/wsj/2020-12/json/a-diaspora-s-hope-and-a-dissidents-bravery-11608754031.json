    "body": "Thank you, Mary Anastasia O’Grady, for highlighting “Cuba’s San Isidro Uprising” (Americas, Dec. 21) and the constant struggle for freedom that the Cuban people having been waging for more than six decades. The courage that these young artists have is admirable and so inspiring.<br />This coming New Year’s Day will mark 60 years since I last walked on Cuban soil. I am one of the millions that constitute the Cuban diaspora, and each of us has a story. When my family and I fled Cuba, Fidel’s government took everything, but the one thing that they couldn’t take from me was the memory of my idyllic childhood, which remains my most treasured possession. Although many of us won’t likely return to a free and sovereign Cuba in our lifetimes, we continue to hope and we continue to say “Viva Cuba libre.”<br />Ana Aguilera Kaufman<br />Chicago<br />"
