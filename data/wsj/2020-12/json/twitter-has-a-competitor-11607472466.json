    "body": "Twitter has never been a money machine like  Facebook  or Google. But Twitter has completely dominated the market it created for 280-character political commentary. Until now. Having chosen to use its power to advance a partisan agenda, the social media company seems to have attracted a formidable competitor—so formidable that other media outlets backing Twitter’s agenda are now taking aim at the upstart.<br />The upstart is called Parler, founded in 2018 and lately adding millions of users because it promises an open platform. According to Parler’s latest Community Guidelines, published last week:<br />Readers may have noticed that the First Amendment is not popular on the left these days, and in fact many media folk are now offended by the idea that a president such as Donald Trump should be permitted to speak to the public without a filter applied by the media industry.<br />Tens of millions of voters are of course offended by the media industry. Therefore it’s no surprise that many of these voters are attracted to a platform promising to be bias-free. Will they now be discouraged by negative media industry coverage of Parler?<br />“Parler’s got a porn problem: Adult businesses target pro-Trump social network,” announces a headline in the Washington Post. At this hour it remains unclear whether the Post has more of a problem with pornography or with a site that allows the modern media obscenity of permitting users to agree with Mr. Trump."
