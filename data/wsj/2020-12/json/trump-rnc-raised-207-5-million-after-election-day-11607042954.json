    "body": "President Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee have raised more than $207.5 million in the weeks since Election Day, his campaign said Thursday, as their claims of voting fraud have generated a financial windfall that could be deployed in future political ventures.<br />Despite an aggressive legal effort by the president’s attorneys in many states, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud and numerous federal and state officials have disputed the campaign’s fraud claims.<br />The size of the postelection fundraising haul between Nov. 4 and Nov. 23 is unprecedented for a losing candidate, much less an outgoing president. The fundraising total ensures Mr. Trump will have a considerable war chest at his disposal as a major figure in the Republican Party, especially as he contemplates a second White House bid.<br />Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, nodded at that ambition in a joint statement with RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel announcing the fundraising total, saying Mr. Trump “remains the leader and source of energy for the Republican Party.”<br />Most political committees, including for presidential candidates, must file postelection fundraising reports by midnight Thursday to the Federal Election Commission. Those reports will include more details about how the $207.5 million has been deployed."
