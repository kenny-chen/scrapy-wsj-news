    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Trump administration added more than a dozen senior Chinese Communist Party officials to its sanctions blacklist on Monday for actions the U.S. says undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy.<br />The measures against 14 vice-chairpersons of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, the country’s top legislative body, are part of a series of sanctions against senior Chinese officials who Washington says are responsible for eroding Hong Kong’s political independence.<br />In announcing the move, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the Chinese Congress’s Standing Committee had been central to China’s efforts. “Beijing’s unrelenting assault against Hong Kong’s democratic processes has gutted its Legislative Council, rendering the body a rubber stamp devoid of meaningful opposition,” he said.<br />The Chinese Embassy didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Asked earlier Monday about reports of the sanctions ahead of their announcement, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in Beijing condemned such moves as meddling in China’s sovereign affairs and defended the Chinese legislature as acting in accordance with the constitution and laws.<br />The National People’s Congress Standing Committee officials are responsible for a new national security law imposed on Hong Kong that the State Department said “effectively neutered the ability of the people of Hong Kong to choose their elected representatives.”"
