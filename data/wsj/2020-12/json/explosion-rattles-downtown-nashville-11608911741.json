    "body": "An explosion rocked downtown Nashville, Tenn., early Christmas morning after an RV blared a warning that it would detonate within 15 minutes, in what local police described as an intentional act.<br />Authorities indicated there were no known fatalities from the blast, which shattered windows, forced evacuations and left at least three people wounded. Metropolitan Nashville Police Department spokesman Don Aaron called the event “significant” and videos showed damage to businesses in the area and fires burning.<br />Local officials described a harrowing early morning scenario leading up to the blast, which took place at 6:30 a.m. Authorities said dozens of people were evacuated from hotels and other buildings. Local police officers initially responded to a 5:30 a.m. report of gunshots in the downtown area. As they arrived, they found a suspicious recreational vehicle on Second Avenue North outside the  AT&T  building. A recording coming from the vehicle said that a potential bomb would detonate within 15 minutes, Police Chief John Drake said.<br />From there, officers began an immediate evacuation of the area. Shortly after that, the vehicle exploded. Police said it was unclear if anyone was inside the RV at the time.<br />Officers “heard announcements coming from this vehicle, took them seriously, and were working to seal the streets to protect folks,” Mr. Aaron said. “We think lives were saved,” said Mr. Aaron of the rush evacuation."
