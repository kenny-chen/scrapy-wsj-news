    "body": "After Timothy Mullaly’s wonderful letter about his father’s sacrifice (“The Human Cost of Massive Plant Closures,” Dec. 9), I was disappointed to see Andrew Lennon take a shot at Beethoven’s father, Johann (“Beethoven’s Fifth, Ninth and 250th,” op-ed, Dec. 17). Fatherhood is the most thankless of jobs. If you are too hard, you are a tyrant. If you are too soft, you aren’t setting a good example. Let us not forget Robert Hayden’s lines from “Those Winter Sundays,” a reflection on the work his father had silently done for him:<br />What did I know, what did I know<br />of love’s austere and lonely offices?<br />Joseph Schmidt<br />Kew Gardens, N.Y."
