    "body": "President-elect Joe Biden said Thursday that he has chosen Rep. Deb Haaland (D., N.M.) to be his interior secretary.<br />If confirmed, Ms. Haaland would be the first ever Native American cabinet secretary.<br />She was one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress. Ms. Haaland is an enrolled citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe in New Mexico.<br />Ms. Haaland, who represents a district that includes Albuquerque, had the support of a variety of backers for the Interior Department job, including Native American tribes, progressive leaders and some House Republicans.<br />House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Wednesday she would support Ms. Haaland’s nomination to lead the Interior Department if Mr. Biden chose her. Mrs. Pelosi’s endorsement was significant because House Democratic leaders have been worried that appointing more members from the House would further narrow their majority, according to people familiar with the situation."
