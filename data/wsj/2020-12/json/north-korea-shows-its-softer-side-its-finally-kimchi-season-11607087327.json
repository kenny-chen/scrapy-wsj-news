But Pyongyang’s image makers are now peddling a softer image of the Kim regime, which is best known for being nuclear-armed, reclusive and impoverished.<br />The makeover attempts surfaced last month, when, in an unusual tactic, separate  Twitter  accounts appeared bearing the names of two Pyongyang bureaucrats: Kim Myong Il, a negotiator who appeared at 2018 inter-Korean talks, and Han Song Il, of a Pyongyang institute considered to be a propaganda agency. The posts—in English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean—depicted everyday life.<br />“It’s finally kimchi season,” the account bearing Mr. Kim’s name tweeted on Nov. 11. “Just thinking about our healthy and tasty kimchi makes my mouth water.”<br />Days before North Korea’s Mother’s Day on Nov. 16, a tweet on the account read, “Mother, much love and respect to you.”"
