    "body": "WASHINGTON—Hunter Biden, the son of President-elect Joe Biden, said in a statement Wednesday that the U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware is “investigating my tax affairs.”<br />Hunter Biden said he takes the matter “very seriously” and is “confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately.”<br />The Justice Department declined to comment on Wednesday.<br />The U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />The criminal investigation that included tax issues began in 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter. It is limited to Hunter Biden and his business dealings and doesn’t implicate other members of his family or the president-elect, another person said."
