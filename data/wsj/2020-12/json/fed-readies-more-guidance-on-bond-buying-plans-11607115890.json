    "body": "Federal Reserve officials are likely to unveil this month new guidance about how long they expect to continue their current asset-purchase program.<br />The approach, which would be detailed at their Dec. 15-16 meeting, would align the program with conditions they spelled out in September about how long they expect to keep interest rates near zero.<br />But in recent interviews and public remarks, officials have said they don’t think they need to change the asset-buying program now to deliver more economic stimulus.<br />Since the Fed’s previous meeting in early November, several drugmakers have released very positive news about vaccines against Covid-19. While rising virus infections could lead to weaker-than-expected economic activity in the coming weeks, the vaccine progress has reduced the chances of much weaker growth in 2021.<br />“The risk characterization has improved,” Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Friday."
