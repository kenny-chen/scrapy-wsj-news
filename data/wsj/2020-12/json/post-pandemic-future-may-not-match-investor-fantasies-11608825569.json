    "body": "When the world eventually opens back up, consumers will step out into a buzzing utopia of technological riches. At least, that is what the stock market would have you believe.<br />The Nasdaq Internet index is up 64% year to date and the Nasdaq Composite 43%, relative to gains of 16% for the S&P 500.

Earlier this month,  Airbnb  finished its first day as a public company worth more than the combined market value of  Marriott International ,   Hilton Worldwide Holdings  and  Hyatt Hotels .<br />The current market suggests that before long, streets will be jammed with Teslas delivering  DoorDash  meals. Houses will all have extensions added as families install home gyms, home offices and home theaters. Hotels will become crumbling 20th century relics.<br />Investors might want to pause this holiday to rethink the fantastical future they are already pricing in."
