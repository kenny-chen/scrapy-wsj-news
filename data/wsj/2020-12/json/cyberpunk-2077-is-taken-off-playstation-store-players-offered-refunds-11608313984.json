    "body": "“Cyberpunk 2077” is no longer available on the PlayStation Store, while the gaming-console’s parent  Sony Corp. , along with Xbox maker  Microsoft Corp. , is offering refunds to customers who bought the videogame on their platforms.<br />The moves come as complaints mount about glitches with the highly anticipated videogame.<br />Warsaw-based  CD Projekt SA,  the developer, on Monday said that the $60 game didn’t function properly on PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One. It said players could seek refunds, a rare move for a major publisher and the latest mark on a project beset by launch delays.<br />The game remains available for purchase in stores and online, CD Projekt said in a tweet Friday. “All purchased digital and physical copies of the game will continue to receive support and updates as we continue to improve your experience,” it said.<br />“Cyberpunk,” which features Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves, is the biggest and most expensive project yet for the more than two-decade-old videogame company. CD Projekt’s co-chief executives miscalculated how long it would take to complete the game, with the Covid-19 pandemic hindering later stages of four years of development, they told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month."
