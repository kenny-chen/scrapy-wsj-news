Jennifer Granholm and former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell are under consideration to lead the federal health department in a Biden administration, according to two people familiar with the transition process.<br />President-elect Joe Biden had been considering other people to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, according to many people familiar with the process. The new names underscore his interest in choosing people who have defended the Affordable Care Act and have ties to the Obama administration.<br />Mr. Becerra has emerged as a contender after leading repeated legal challenges to the Trump administration’s health policies, including its efforts to unwind parts of Obamacare.<br />Mr. Becerra led a coalition of 20 states and Washington, D.C., in a legal defense of the ACA after Republican-led states brought a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the Obama-era health law. The U.S. Supreme Court last month heard arguments in the case, and the Trump administration has asked the court to strike down swaths of the ACA.<br />In July, Mr. Becerra was among three state attorneys general who led a coalition suing to halt a Trump administration rule rolling back protections against discrimination for people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender."
