    "body": "James Freeman is away and will return 12/8.<br />Et tu, Mayor?<br />A couple of weeks ago, California Gov. Gavin Newsom got caught dining with a dozen or so others, including the head of the California Medical Association, at the ritzy Napa Valley restaurant French Laundry in violation of his own social-distancing rules.<br />Mr. Newsom apologized while excusing his faux pas in part by saying the soiree was outdoors. Not quite. Fox 11 news later posted photos showing the get-together took place in a dining room that was mostly enclosed. As a local Fox reporter tweeted, “A witness who took photos tells us his group was so loud, the sliding doors had to be closed.”<br />Mr. Newsom’s virus guidelines also say people should keep their voices down because “the likelihood of transmission and spread increases with laughing, singing, loud talking and difficulty maintaining physical distance.”"
