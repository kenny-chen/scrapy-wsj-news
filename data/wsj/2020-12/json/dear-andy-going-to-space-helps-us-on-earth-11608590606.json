    "body": "Andy Kessler is right to ask “Dear NASA: What’s in It for Me?” (Inside View, Dec. 14), but he seems to miss how this question has been answered by the history of exploration. Columbus thought he had found a new route to Asia. Not quite. But would anyone deny that wealth and opportunities followed his discovery?<br />We don’t really know what space exploration might yield for humanity. We know only that we live on a tiny speck of real estate compared with the almost endless spaces and places that begin 62 miles above us. Will we find new deposits of rare-earth metals on the Moon? A better way to track asteroids coming from the direction of sun? It’s worth betting that we’ll discover a lot more than we anticipate—and a lot more than Velcro and Tang.<br />Ken Hoagland<br />Arlington, Va.<br />"
