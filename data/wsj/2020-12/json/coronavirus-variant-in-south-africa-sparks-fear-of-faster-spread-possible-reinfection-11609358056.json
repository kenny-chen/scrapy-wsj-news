    "body": "South African doctors and researchers battling a second wave of Covid-19 cases are racing to understand what role a new coronavirus variant might play in the new surge of infections.<br />Total confirmed cases of Covid-19 in South Africa passed one million this week. On Wednesday, the country of 60 million recorded 17,710 new infections, higher than any daily case load seen during its first wave of infections, which peaked in July.<br />Doctors say they have to ration oxygen and lack the manpower to do best-practice care, such as turning patients on their bellies. One-third of coronavirus tests are coming back positive, suggesting that the true number of infections is likely much higher.<br />South African researchers in November first discovered the new coronavirus variant—which shows similarities to a variant found in December in the U.K.— and it quickly became dominant in the country’s coronavirus hot spots. The researchers say the South African variant has the same mutation that U.K. scientists say might have made the variant there significantly more contagious than other versions of the virus.<br />South African researchers say they also have found changes in the virus’s structure that, in earlier laboratory tests, led to increased resistance to antibodies from people who recovered from Covid-19."
