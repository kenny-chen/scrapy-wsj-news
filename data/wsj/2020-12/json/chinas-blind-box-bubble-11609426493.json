    "body": "A Chinese craze for “blind box” toys has caught fire in the stock market, and drawn some unwelcome attention from the government.<br />Last week, official state media organ Xinhua criticized the new craze for “blind boxes,” which contain a collectible toy with the exact design a mystery to the buyer. The format drives repeated purchases, especially from young people who want to get their hands on their favorite toys.<br />Xinhua isn’t amused. “Once you enter into the abyss of blind boxes, your wallet will become like a stranger passing on the street,” it said. The article compares the phenomenon to gambling and urges tighter regulations.<br />Blind-box maker  Pop Mart International Group  has kicked off a stock market frenzy too. Its stock has more than doubled since its initial public offering three weeks ago, valuing the company at $14.7 billion—higher than  Hasbro ’s  $12.9 billion or  Mattel ’s  $6.1 billion. Pop Marts’ revenue grew nearly 1,000% from 2017 to 2019 and its blind boxes earned a gross profit margin of 70.5% in the first half of 2020.<br />But scrutiny from state media is rarely a good thing: Pop Mart’s shares have lost 5.6% this week."
