    "body": "Facebook ’s  motto in its early days was to “move fast and break things.” That’s also one way to describe the Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Facebook that was seconded this week by 46 state Attorneys General. That so many lawyers could come up with such a weak legal case is remarkable.<br />CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t have many political friends these days in either party. He has been criticized for restricting speech on his platform both too much and too little. Facebook has helped to destroy the advertising market for newspapers, and the world might be better off without it.<br />But the purpose of U.S. antitrust law isn’t to remedy social or political problems. That’s essentially what the FTC on a 3-2 vote and the AGs are seeking with their lawsuits that asks courts to force Facebook to divest its Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014) acquisitions.<br />According to the FTC complaint, Mr. Zuckerberg sought to buy Instagram and WhatsApp to neutralize competition. Well, sure. “It is better to buy than compete,” Mr. Zuckerberg emailed in 2008. Any business must adapt as technology and consumer tastes change. Mr. Zuckerberg saw how smart phones increased photo sharing and private instant messaging.<br />It was less expensive and easier for Facebook to acquire apps than build copycats. But bigger companies buy upstarts all the time. Note also that Instagram and WhatsApp were complementary apps to Facebook, not direct competitors. Many people use parallel social-media platforms with distinct features such as TikTok,  Twitter ,   Pinterest ,  Reddit and Snap."
