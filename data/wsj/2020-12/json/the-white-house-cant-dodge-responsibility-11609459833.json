    "body": "Scott Atlas’s op-ed “A Pandemic of Misinformation” (Dec. 22) contributes to the problem he laments. He writes that states directed their own pandemic policies, with governors and local officials responsible for outcomes. A lack of leadership from the White House left them no other choice. For example, Washington’s Opening Up America Again guidelines were well-received, but the administration promptly ignored them, pushing states to open before reaching important health benchmarks.<br />Jared Kushner relayed President Trump’s posture to Bob Woodward: The states would be responsible for the public-health burden while he’d own the reopening. “The opening is going to be very popular,” Mr. Kushner said.<br />An October Gallup report concluded that “the most important factor in Americans’ decision to [take Covid precautions seriously] is exposure to accurate information about the pandemic from sources they trust.” Mr. Trump played down Covid’s seriousness, belittled masks, flaunted CDC guidelines and ran a White House that became a Covid epicenter. The government’s investment in vaccines must be applauded. Otherwise, its actions fell short.<br />David Stone<br />Birmingham, Mich."
