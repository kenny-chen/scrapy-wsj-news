    "body": "Columbus, Ga.<br />Joe Biden won Georgia.<br />That statement isn’t as hard on Republicans’ ears as it was in early November. A hand recount that concluded Dec. 7, the Electoral College vote on Dec. 14, and the simple passing of time have made the result seem final, even among voters who doubt it.<br />But for weeks, widespread denial among Republicans obscured the result’s significance. With 49.5% of the vote to President Trump’s 49.3%, Mr. Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to carry Georgia. No Democrat since Bill Clinton had won any state in the once solidly Democratic Deep South, defined to include Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina along with the Peach State.<br />Until this year, Southern Senate delegations seemed to have undergone a similar Republican realignment. With the exception of Alabama’s Doug Jones, who edged out a scandal-plagued Republican nominee in a 2017 special election (and was soundly defeated for a full term in November), no Democrat has won a Deep South Senate seat since 2008, and not one has unseated a Republican incumbent since 1986."
