    "body": "WASHINGTON—Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn defended his agency’s vetting process for  Pfizer Inc.’s  Covid-19 vaccine, saying a thorough and meticulous review is needed to assure a skeptical public of the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness.<br />In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Dr. Hahn said his agency has had 150 people working days, nights and weekends in parallel teams to review the test data submitted by Pfizer and German partner  BioNTech SE .<br />The FDA has also scheduled a meeting of an outside advisory committee for Dec. 10 to review the test data, which Dr. Hahn said was another step taken to assure the public amid concerns that the FDA might rush approval.<br />“We realize there is an issue in the U.S. around vaccine hesitancy. There have been concerns raised about the speed with which Covid-19 vaccines have been developed,” Dr. Hahn said. “This will meet our gold standard of safety and efficacy that the American people have come to trust.”<br />Dr. Hahn’s comments came on the day that British regulators cleared the Pfizer vaccine for general distribution. A day before, Dr. Hahn had been summoned to the White House by President Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to explain why the FDA wasn’t acting as quickly as the British."
