    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday as investors weighed prospects for new fiscal stimulus and awaited fresh data on the pace of recovery in the labor market.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, indicating muted gains in the broader gauge after the New York opening bell. Contracts linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 gained 0.4%.<br />Brent crude futures, the global benchmark for oil markets, climbed 2.1% to $49.76 a barrel—their highest level since March—after OPEC and a group of Russia-led oil producers agreed to increase their collective output by 500,000 barrels a day next month.<br />The world’s biggest producers are betting that the worst of a pandemic-inspired shock to demand is behind them after curtailed travel weighed heavily on oil prices this year.<br />Trading in stocks this week has been mixed following last month’s rally, when investors cheered progress in Covid-19 vaccines."
