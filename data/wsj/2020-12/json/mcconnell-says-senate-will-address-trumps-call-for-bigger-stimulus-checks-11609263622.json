    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked an effort by Democrats to hold a vote on sending bigger stimulus checks to many Americans, amid growing calls within the GOP for the larger coronavirus-relief payments sought by President Trump.<br />The Kentucky Republican, without committing to hold a vote, said the Senate would address Mr. Trump’s demands to boost the size of the checks to $2,000 from $600 as well as his concerns about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which regulates online speech, and his complaints about purported election fraud. Mr. Trump has blamed fraud for his defeat in the November election, but no significant fraud has emerged.<br />“This week the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus,” Mr. McConnell said, without offering further details. A person familiar with his thinking said Mr. McConnell was considering putting all three items into one bill.<br />The comments came after several Republican senators, including two competing in runoffs soon that will decide control of the Senate, said they would support larger checks.<br />Mr. Trump signed a Covid-19 aid bill into law Sunday but said that the $600 payments in that package were too small. The House then moved to vote to increase the size of the checks to $2,000, which passed Monday night 275 to 134, with 44 Republicans joining almost all Democrats in support."
