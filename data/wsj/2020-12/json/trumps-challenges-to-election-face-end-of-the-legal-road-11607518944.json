    "body": "A sweeping multistate legal effort by President Trump and his supporters to override President-elect Joe Biden’s victory has reached the end of the line, with losses in courts at all levels including the U.S. Supreme Court.<br />In the five weeks since Election Day, the Trump campaign and other Republicans have lost in court at least 35 times in six pivotal states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In several other cases, the campaign or allies withdrew claims after filing them.<br />On Tuesday, the Supreme Court in a one-sentence order turned away a last-ditch effort by Pennsylvania Republicans to invalidate votes from the state’s vote-by-mail system enacted by the state legislature last year. No justice noted a dissent to the order, which was released on the deadline for states to complete election results before the Electoral College meets and casts its vote on Dec. 14.<br />Trump campaign lawyers promised to push forward. “The only fixed day in the U.S. Constitution is the inauguration of the president on January 20,” the Trump campaign’s legal team said.<br />In some of the cases, judges criticized Republicans for making sweeping allegations of voting irregularities and fraud without any proof. In others, courts said they raised relatively minor claims but sought unprecedented action, such as the rejection of millions of votes."
