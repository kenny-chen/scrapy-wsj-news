    "body": "DoorDash Inc.  delivered for investors.<br />The market leader in U.S. food delivery was greeted with strong investor enthusiasm Wednesday, giving the seven-year-old company a value surpassing many of the restaurant companies that depend on its couriers to deliver their food.<br />DoorDash has never turned an annual profit, but a surge in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic has helped to transform the San Francisco company. Revenue and orders at DoorDash more than tripled this summer and fall, compared with the year before, as consumers tired of prepping food at home and ordered more meals for delivery.<br />The result led the company’s valuation to jump to roughly $71.8 billion, as of the close Wednesday, from $15 billion earlier in the year.<br />Founded in 2013 by Tony Xu, who emigrated from China with his parents when he was five years old, DoorDash now must defend its nearly 50% U.S, market share in the competitive food-delivery industry and stoke further growth to satisfy heightened shareholder expectations. The company believes the ease by which diners can get food delivered won’t be a fad, but demand could slow as vaccines for the coronavirus are distributed and patrons return to restaurant dining rooms they have been avoiding."
