    "body": "TEL AVIV—Former American naval analyst Jonathan Pollard arrived in Israel early Wednesday with his wife after spending 30 years in prison for spying for Israel, a case that caused friction for years between the two close allies.<br />Mr. Pollard and his wife Esther were greeted at the tarmac by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who handed them their national I.D. cards as they descended from the plane.<br />“How great it is that you have come home. Now you can start life anew, in freedom and happiness. Now you’re home,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a video from the event released by his office showed.<br />Mr. Pollard, now 66 years old, was arrested in 1985 on charges of providing Israel with sensitive military intelligence and was sentenced to life in prison. He was released in 2015 and placed on a five-year parole that ended in November, allowing him to leave the U.S.<br />Mr. Pollard is an American but Israel granted him citizenship while he was imprisoned. Successive Israeli governments have argued that the life sentence for spying on a close ally was too harsh and that Mr. Pollard should be released early."
