    "body": "WASHINGTON—Xavier Becerra already knows what he would do as Health and Human Services secretary.<br />The 62-year-old California attorney general said he first would work to fight the coronavirus pandemic and meet weekly with President-elect Joe Biden on the effort. He would focus on vaccine distribution, availability of personal protective equipment and advocating that people wear masks<br />“The three biggest priorities for President-elect Biden will be Covid, Covid, Covid,” he said in an interview.<br />Mr. Becerra said his leadership of the $1 trillion agency would be collaborative. He imagines relying on policy leaders, career staff and public-health leaders, saying, “There is no CEO who does it alone.”<br />But first, Mr. Becerra, a darling of many on the left for his defense of the Affordable Care Act and other liberal policies, faces stiff opposition from some Senate Republicans who say he is too liberal, too pro-abortion rights and too inexperienced in health care for the post."
