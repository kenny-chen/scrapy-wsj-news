    "body": "Denny Rodman, an antiques collector in Houston, made an exciting find on Facebook’s online marketplace in August. An old image of three men looked a lot like the infamous Dalton brothers, the Wild West bank robbers.<br />He bought the photo for $100, wrote a 35-page report arguing for its authenticity, then sent the report to Bob Utley, a 91-year-old authority on the outlaws of the period. He included a facial-recognition analysis that showed strong evidence of a match.<br />Mr. Utley wasn’t convinced. “Identifying people of generations ago by face recognition is almost always a non-starter,” he wrote back. “It’s a very long shot that these portraits are of the Daltons.”<br />Facial-recognition technology, commonly used to unlock phones, open doors and even surveil the unsuspecting public, is roiling the world of antique photograph collecting. Hobbyists have turned to facial-recognition software to try to match faces in found photos to those of famous historical figures.<br />Antiquities brokers, auctioneers and historians, however, say such methods aren’t dependable, and that the technology has loosed a flood of bogus claims about the identifies of people in ordinary old photos. Hobbyists interested in the 19th century American West have surfaced with claims about newly found photos of the bad guys like Billy the Kid and Jesse James and famed lawmen such as Wyatt Earp and Pat Garrett."
