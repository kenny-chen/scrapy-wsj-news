The only thing that hits parents harder than college-loan debt is sacrificing for 20 years to avoid borrowing in the first place.<br />Paul Nichols<br />Latham, N.Y.<br /><br />Why would you borrow so much money for a degree that doesn’t generate enough income to pay it back? If you are buying a house, an appraisal is done to make sure that the loan isn’t worth more than the house and that you have enough earnings potential to pay the loan. If you are borrowing for a business, you must have a credible business forecast and collateral. Yet for a degree with low earnings potential, you can borrow to the hilt."
