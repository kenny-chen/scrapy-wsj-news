    "body": "MOSCOW—Russian President Vladimir Putin accused U.S. intelligence officers of supporting political opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was poisoned earlier this year with a military-grade nerve agent, and dismissed allegations that Moscow was behind the attack.<br />“If [Russian intelligence agents] had wanted to, we would have finished the job,” Mr. Putin said Thursday with a laugh during a more than four-hour annual news conference, which he conducted remotely from his residence outside of Moscow.<br />Mr. Putin offered no evidence for his assertions.<br />Mr. Navalny has accused Mr. Putin of ordering his poisoning. The European Union in October sanctioned some of Russia’s top political figures with a travel ban and an asset freeze in response to Mr. Navalny’s attack.<br />Earlier this year, Mr. Navalny lost consciousness while traveling on a commercial flight from Siberia to Moscow. After he was evacuated to Berlin, European doctors said traces of a Soviet-era nerve agent, called Novichok, were found in his system, adding another flashpoint in already toxic relations between Russia and the West."
