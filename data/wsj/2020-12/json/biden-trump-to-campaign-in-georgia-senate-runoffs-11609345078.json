    "body": "WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden will travel to Georgia to campaign for the two Democrats in runoff elections that will decide the control of the Senate, as he and President Trump hold competing rallies in the state next week.<br />The dueling events will showcase the parties’ electoral strategies in a traditionally Republican-dominated state, where Mr. Biden beat Mr. Trump by a razor-thin margin in the November election. He was the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry Georgia since 1992, giving his party hope for similar upset victories in the Senate voting Tuesday.<br />In Georgia, Senate candidates must win with more than 50% of the vote or face a runoff. Two Senate seats were on the ballot in Georgia in November, and no candidate cleared that bar in either race, triggering next week’s runoffs.<br />Mr. Trump will headline an event Monday in Dalton, a city in northwest Georgia, with Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Mr. Biden is traveling to Atlanta to campaign the same day for their Democratic challengers: documentary filmmaker Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, respectively.<br />On Sunday, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will campaign for the Democratic ticket in Savannah, Ga."
