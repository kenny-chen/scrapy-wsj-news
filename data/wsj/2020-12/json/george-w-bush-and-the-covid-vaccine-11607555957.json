    "body": "It’s poetic that when the U.K. began its Covid vaccinations Tuesday, the second person to receive an injection was 81-year-old William Shakespeare from Warwickshire, his famous namesake’s home county.<br />“When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions,” the Bard wrote in “Hamlet,” using words that aptly describe this awful year. The coronavirus has brought death, suffering, sorrow, isolation, despair and economic ruin. But even as dark winter approaches, we’re sustained by something else: hope.<br />It comes in the form of vaccines, which typically take years, even decades, to develop—never mind manufacturing and distributing them in quantities large enough to achieve “herd immunity” and make viral spread highly unlikely.<br />Yet here we are, less than a year after the coronavirus hit, with multiple effective vaccines tested, approved in some countries, and mass-produced. It’ll take months to make billions more, distribute them and inoculate people in numbers large enough to end this global pandemic, so we aren’t out of the woods yet. But we’re witnessing modern science’s amazing ingenuity, creativity and results.<br />Credit for the unprecedented speed in developing these vaccines goes to scientists and researchers who worked endless hours and showed incredible skill. Credit also goes to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, which gave critical resources and expeditious approvals to pharmaceutical companies."
