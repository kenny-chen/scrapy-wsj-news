    "body": "Bipartisan groups of lawmakers are pushing for hate-crime bills in South Carolina and Arkansas, two of only three states without laws that penalize crimes motivated by bias.<br />Leaders in both Republican-led states have long resisted hate-crime bills, saying existing laws are adequate to punish crimes.<br />But many legislators say they feel a sense of urgency to take a policy stance after the killing of George Floyd and other Black people this year. The Georgia legislature passed a hate-crimes bill in a matter of weeks last June, following the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery.<br />The Georgia bill, which became law with Republican Gov. Brian Kempâ€™s signature, increases the sentence in cases where the victim was selected on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation or other bias. It also creates a hate-crimes database.<br />Legislators in South Carolina and Arkansas have looked to the Georgia law as a model able to draw broad bipartisan support in a historically conservative state."
