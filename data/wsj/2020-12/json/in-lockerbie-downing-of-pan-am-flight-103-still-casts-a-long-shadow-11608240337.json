    "body": "LOCKERBIE, Scotland—The sky rained fire on a chill December night here in 1988. Karen Gass was 26 years old at the time. She didn’t realize at first what was happening.<br />“I ran down the street, and there was rubble everywhere like it was a war-zone,” she recalled on Thursday. “The whole place was lit up.”<br />The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 ripped a scar across this Scottish town near the border with England, and memories and ongoing investigations and court cases mean the tragedy more than three decades ago continues to cast a long shadow.<br />On Sherwood Crescent, 11 people were killed—including a mother, father and daughter, pelted by aircraft parts. Wreckage, battered suitcases and the bodies of 259 passengers and crew members fell on the surrounding fields.<br />In the weeks that followed, the people of Lockerbie rallied to help visiting relatives of the dead. They washed and ironed each piece of clothing recovered from the crash site that wasn’t collected as evidence."
