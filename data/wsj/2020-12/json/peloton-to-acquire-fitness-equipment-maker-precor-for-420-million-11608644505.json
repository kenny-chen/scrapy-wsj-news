    "body": "Peloton Interactive Inc.  has agreed to acquire commercial fitness-equipment provider Precor Inc. for $420 million in cash, in a move that will help it break into commercial markets and boost its manufacturing capacity at a time when the company is racing to meet demand.<br />Months into the pandemic, Peloton, known for selling $2,000-plus stationary bikes equipped with screens that show subscription workout classes, has struggled both with reducing delivery delays and long wait times for customer-service support as the pandemic drives a surge in demand for its connected stationary bikes and treadmills.<br />Peloton has attributed the delays to shipping logjams, particularly at ports as the bikes are transported to the U.S. from manufacturers overseas.<br />The deal with Precor will help bring some of that manufacturing home. Precor has two U.S.-based manufacturing facilities, which will join Peloton’s network of third-party manufacturers and its Tonic facilities in Taiwan, the company said.<br />“By making fitness equipment closer to U.S. consumers, Peloton will be able to deliver connected fitness products to members sooner,” the company said."
