    "body": "Elon Musk’s space-transportation company SpaceX blasted its Starship spacecraft nearly 8 miles high and maneuvered it back seemingly to a pinpoint landing, but then suffered a spectacular explosion as the vehicle failed to slow down before smashing into the ground.<br />Wednesday’s sequence of events even prompted an elated Mr. Musk initially to post a message on Twitter that the 16-story Starship prototype executed a key airborne maneuver precisely and made it back to the designated landing point. Checking the craft’s ability to control its direction during descent was one of the main reasons for the flight, the first high-altitude test of the private vehicle designed to explore the solar system.<br />But within minutes, after a video feed showed a fireball at the instant of touchdown, Mr. Musk posted a follow-up tweet explaining that low fuel pressure “during the landing burn contributed to the high touchdown velocity and the massive explosion.”<br />Still, the company’s founder and chief technical officer added there was good news because the team “got all the data” it needed during the mission. “It appears everything is in order for future tests,” he said.<br />Weeks before launch, Mr. Musk had sought to tamp down expectations by predicting a 1-in-3 chance of success for the test of the reusable craft, which uses a complex midair maneuver that flips it from nose-down to a final nose-up descent. That abrupt movement—which industry officials say hasn’t been successfully executed before by any other big booster—is one of the most challenging aspects of Starship’s flight profile. Preparing for the flight, Mr. Musk promised the company would show real-time footage of the test, “warts and all”—something he had eschewed for some earlier Starship tests."
