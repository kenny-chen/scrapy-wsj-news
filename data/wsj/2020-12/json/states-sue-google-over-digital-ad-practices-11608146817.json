    "body": "WASHINGTON—A coalition of state attorneys general sued Google, accusing the search giant of operating an illegal digital-advertising monopoly, in part thanks to an auction-rigging deal with rival  Facebook Inc.<br />The complaint, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Texas, alleges that Facebook emerged in 2017 as a powerful new rival to the  Alphabet Inc.  unit’s established dominance in the market for online advertising. In response, the complaint says, Google initiated a deal with the social-media company that allowed the search giant to preserve its commanding position in a key segment of the online ad market, while guaranteeing Facebook would win a certain share of Google-run ad auctions.<br />Google on Wednesday denied engaging in any anticompetitive behavior and repeated its stance that it operates in highly competitive markets.<br />“Attorney General Paxton’s ad tech claims are meritless, yet he’s gone ahead in spite of all the facts. We’ve invested in state-of-the-art ad tech services that help businesses and benefit consumers,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “We will strongly defend ourselves from his baseless claims in court.”<br />Facebook had no immediate comment on the lawsuit’s allegations."
