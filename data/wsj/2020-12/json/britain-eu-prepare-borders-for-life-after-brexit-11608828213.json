    "body": "A giant parking lot on a disused airfield in southern England. Portable toilets on highways leading to English Channel ports. Thousands of customs officials. And an expensive advertising campaign.<br />Britain is getting ready for life after Brexit.<br />The U.K. officially left the European Union in January but has maintained seamless access to the bloc while a trade deal was negotiated. Even with an agreement reached, come Jan. 1, Britain will be cut off from the EU’s customs union and that means for the first time in nearly half a century there will be customs checks on goods traveling between the two economies.<br />Britain also leaves the EU’s single market—the bloc’s zone of harmonized regulation—which will require further border formalities, for example to certify that food and other exports from the U.K. meet EU standards.<br />One of the first visible effects of Brexit will be big frontier delays created by increased border bureaucracy."
