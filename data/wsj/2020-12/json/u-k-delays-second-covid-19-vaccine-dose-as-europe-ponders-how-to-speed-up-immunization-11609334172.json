    "body": "The U.K. will focus on giving as many people as possible a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, even if this delays administering a second one, the government said Tuesday, despite a lack of data about the extent of the immunity conferred by a single dose.<br />The news comes as scientists in Europe are debating whether recipients should be given one dose instead of two given the scarcity of the vaccine, the difficulties in fending off a winter surge in infections, and a rapidly mounting death toll.<br />The problem: While scientists say a single dose may well confer sufficient immunity to stop the spread of the virus, there isnâ€™t sufficient data confirming this because the clinical trials for available vaccines and those nearing authorizations were all designed around a two-dose regimen.<br />Britain, which is coming under severe strain amid the spread of a new, more infectious variant of the virus, is the first European government to change its policy. It stressed that vaccine recipients would still get a second dose, just three months later than planned.<br />Some provinces in Canada have been delaying the second dose to inoculate more people at once, and Belgium is considering a similar approach."
