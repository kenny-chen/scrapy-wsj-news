    "body": "The mega LBO is back. Maybe.<br />Leveraged buyout bids measuring in the double-digit billions, a relative rarity since the financial crisis, have been showing signs of a comeback lately.<br />Earlier this month, private-equity firm  CVC Capital Partners submitted a proposal worth more than $20 billion for Japan’s  Toshiba Corp. , setting off a potential auction. Meanwhile, Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners and Sweden’s  EQT  AB have teamed up for a bid on  Royal KPN  NV that could value the Dutch telecommunications company at more than $15 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />And medical-supply giant Medline Industries Inc. has hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  to help it explore a sale, likely to one or more private-equity firms, the Journal reported. Such a deal could value the family-owned company at as much as $30 billion.<br />It is far from guaranteed that any of these transactions will be completed—and, indeed, on Tuesday Toshiba rebuffed the CVC proposal, but the fact that they are even under consideration is noteworthy. Between 2005 and 2007, private-equity firms inked 18 deals worth $10 billion or more, according to Dealogic. Since then, they have struck only 10, mindful that many of the precrisis deals didn’t work out as planned."
