    "body": "Regarding Michael Taube’s “Lament for the European Super League” (op-ed, April 28): The failed European soccer Super League was nothing more than a scheme by the biggest clubs to insulate themselves from competition.<br />Slots in the major European tournaments are currently awarded to the best-performing teams in domestic leagues—and smaller teams regularly edge out the wealthiest clubs.<br />Further, the worst teams from top-tier domestic leagues are relegated every year to lower-tier leagues, while the best teams from lower-tier leagues are promoted. Imagine if several AAA baseball teams were promoted to the majors every year, while the worst-performing Major League Baseball teams were demoted to the minors. This increases competitive behavior by creating an incentive against teams “tanking,” typically for a better draft position, and creates more excitement.<br />The European Super League would have undermined domestic leagues to create a new league where the wealthiest teams could, in essence, never lose. Fortunately for the sport, this ploy turned into an own goal for its backers.<br />Will Coggin"
