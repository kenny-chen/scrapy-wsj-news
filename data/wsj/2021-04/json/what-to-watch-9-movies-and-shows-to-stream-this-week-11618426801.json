She and her film’s star, Frances McDormand, are considered front-runners at the Oscars next weekend. The film is currently streaming on Hulu.<br />Here’s what else is streaming this week:<br />( Disney +)<br />A successful college basketball coach loses his cool, gets violent and finds himself fired. The only coaching job he can get is in high school. To assert himself, he boots one of the players from his first practice. Yes, this is the premise of the Gene Hackman classic, “Hoosiers.” It is also the chassis for the latest John Stamos vehicle. The former “Full House” star and off-and-on drummer for the Beach Boys, is now coaching the women’s basketball team at an elite private school in “Big Shot.”<br />Mr. Stamos says sports are completely foreign to him. He doesn’t watch, he doesn’t play, and he was a band geek in high school. (“I’m still a band geek,” he adds.) But he says he experienced the same kind of discipline, high expectations and respect that coach Marvin Korn relays to his players, from his dad."
