    "body": "A variant of the coronavirus first spotted in India has been detected in the U.S. and 18 other countries and territories, adding to a growing roster of evolutionary spinoffs of the virus that scientists and health authorities are keeping under close observation.<br />The variant, known as B.1.617, isn’t as well studied as other worrisome variants—some of which are also circulating in India—and its role in driving India’s current wave of infection isn’t entirely clear. The surge in cases followed a loosening of restrictions and a large number of religious and political gatherings.<br />Scientists are working to understand how its precise set of mutations affects its ability to spread from person to person and if those mutations give it an edge over our immune defenses, vaccines included.<br />With little sign of any reprieve Tuesday from the surge in infections that has overwhelmed hospitals in many parts of India, the army was deployed to assist with medical care as a convoy of tanker trucks transporting oxygen arrived in the nation’s capital. Foreign help began arriving in the country, including 100 ventilators and 95 oxygen concentrators from the U.K., the first of a large number of shipments from there and elsewhere.<br />Covid-19 cases rose by another 320,000 to 17.2 million, putting India behind only the U.S. in terms of confirmed infections. The Health Ministry reported another 2,771 deaths in the past 24 hours."
