    "body": "WASHINGTON— Amazon. com Inc.’s bid to win back the Pentagon’s JEDI cloud computing contract stayed alive Wednesday as a federal judge rejected motions by the Defense Department and  Microsoft Corp.  to dismiss much of Amazon’s challenge of the contract award.<br />Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims rejected the motions, according to a court docket entry. Her opinion and order in the case weren’t made public immediately, making the extent of the government’s legal defeat unclear.<br />The move is significant nonetheless because it opens the door to continued protracted court battles over the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, contract.<br />Some Pentagon officials have suggested in recent months that the Defense Department might have to consider other approaches to obtaining enterprise-level cloud services, rather than pursuing further years of litigation over the long-delayed JEDI contract.<br />The Pentagon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
