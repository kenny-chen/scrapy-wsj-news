    "body": "Peggy Noonan’s near-obituary for the Republican Party (“America Needs the GOP, and It Needs Help,” Declarations, April 10) overlooks many of the results of the 2020 elections. In the states, Republicans were defending seven governorships to the Democrats’ four but still managed to gain one, increasing the GOP’s share of governorships to 27. In the U.S. House, Republicans gained 14 seats on net from 2018, leaving the Democrats with only a very narrow majority. The Senate ended up tied.<br />It is interesting to read of Ms. Noonan’s political comings and goings over the years, but “no one likes the Republican Party”? Let’s stick to the facts.<br />Ken Laudenbach<br />Bala Cynwyd, Pa.<br />"
