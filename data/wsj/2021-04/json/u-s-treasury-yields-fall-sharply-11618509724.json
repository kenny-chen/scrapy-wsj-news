    "body": "U.S. Treasury yields registered their biggest one-day decline since early November on Thursday, reflecting renewed demand for government debt after sustained selling in the first quarter.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 1.531%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 1.637% on Wednesday.<br />Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, edged lower overnight before dropping sharply near the start of U.S. trading, and continued their slide throughout much of the session. That came despite a strong retail sales report that might normally be expected to push yields higher since they tend to rise when the economic outlook improves.<br />Debt investors, though, have shrugged off good economic data in recent days as much as they ignored some weak data over the winter. Instead, higher yields have lured buyers, apparently aided by technical factors such as renewed demand from Japanese investors.<br />Banks and insurers in Japan had contributed to a wave of global selling in February, according to investors and analysts, prompted by efforts to finalize their investment returns for the financial year that ended on March 31. Now, there is evidence that they are buying again, with new government data showing that Japanese investors bought the equivalent of $15.6 billion of overseas bonds on net last week, the most since November."
