    "body": "The first 100 days of Joe Biden’s presidency, a milestone he will reach this week, were largely about fighting the coronavirus and stimulating the domestic economy.<br />For the second 100 days, the rest of the world is closing in.<br />China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all are set to test the president, or already are doing so. China is making ominous moves around Taiwan and in the South China Sea. Though it has backed off a bit in recent days, Russia continues to strike a threatening posture toward Ukraine. Iran has increased the level to which it is enriching uranium, putting new importance on talks about reviving a nuclear agreement with the U.S.<br />And as for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un—well, he’s a bit like the Glenn Close character in the movie “Fatal Attraction,” who declares: “I will not be ignored.” He’s already fired off a few test missiles to prove the point.<br />This isn’t necessarily the agenda the president or his team want for the next 100 days. They have further big domestic ambitions, starting with a giant $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, followed by a similarly large plan to improve child care and education, to be paid for by hotly contested tax increases."
