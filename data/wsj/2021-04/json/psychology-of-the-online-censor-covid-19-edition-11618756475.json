    "body": "Regarding Jay Bhattacharya’s “Masks for Children, Muzzles for News,” (op-ed, April 14): How ironic that high-tech companies, always looking to ride the wave of the next new thing, are so cautious when it comes to science. One wonders how compliant YouTube and  Twitter  staff are in following the consensus guidelines that they so vigorously enforce. Do they really think there is no truth outside these guidelines, which have changed so often and at times seem to reflect political considerations? Their paternalism is likely to cause untold lasting harm.<br />Larry Eisenberg, M.D.<br />Los Angeles<br /><br />Support for extended lockdown practices has become a sort of weird, weenie Woodstock with endless opportunities for criticizing, shaming, censoring and canceling. Amazingly, many of the most fervent supporters are young people who have seemingly forsaken youthful rebellion for slavish conformity. Common sense will have an uphill struggle in this fight."
