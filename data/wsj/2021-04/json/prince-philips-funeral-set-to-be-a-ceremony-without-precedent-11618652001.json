    "body": "LONDON—Prince Philip is to be laid to rest Saturday in the vault of St. George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle after a service without precedent in the British monarchy’s long history.<br />Government restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 have forced changes in arrangements long in the planning, including by the prince himself. After a career in the Royal Navy during World War II, where he was commended for heroism, Prince Philip married then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and has been by her side since she became queen in 1952. He died on April 9, aged 99.<br />The restrictions limit the numbers in the funeral congregation to 30 family members. The congregation, including the queen, is required to be socially distanced and wear face masks. The only attendees permitted to sing are a four-person choir standing away from the mourners in the nave of the church, who will sing hymns chosen by the prince and the national anthem.<br />The ceremony will be broadcast widely across the U.S. and other parts of the world but will entirely take place behind the castle walls. No members of the public will be able to witness any of it directly, and police are being deployed to discourage people from gathering.<br />The formalities are under close scrutiny in part to cast light on the royal family’s recent struggles."
