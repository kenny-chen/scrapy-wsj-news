    "body": "The pandemic’s boost is fading for  Sony ,  but the company’s longer term content-focused strategy still looks likely to pay off.<br />On Wednesday, the Japanese electronics-and-entertainment giant reported a record net profit for the fiscal year ended in March. The highest-ever earnings from its game division, helped by stay-at-home demand, was the major driver.<br />Sony has sold 7.8 million of its new PlayStation 5 console since its November release, outpacing its predecessor at the same stage. It could have sold even more if not for supply constraints due to a chip shortage. Operating profit at its game division fell almost 30% year-over-year last quarter. That was partly due to marketing expenses for the PS5 launch and because the console is sold below cost.<br />But the boost from the Covid-19 pandemic could soon be over. Sony issued a cautious outlook, forecasting a decline in operating income this fiscal year—though the company has usually been conservative in its guidance, according to Jefferies.<br />Beyond the pandemic, Sony is beefing up its content offerings. The company signed deals earlier this month with  Netflix  and  Disney  to feature Sony’s new movies on their online streaming platforms. That means that Spider-Man will finally reunite with other Marvel superheroes, but also that Sony is probably not launching its own online streaming service. That is the right decision: other major Hollywood studios are jumping into the crowded field."
