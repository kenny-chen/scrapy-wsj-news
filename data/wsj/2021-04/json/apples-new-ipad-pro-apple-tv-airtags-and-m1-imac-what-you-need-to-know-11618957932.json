The iMac, because it’s a desktop that, well, stays on your desk. The big iPad Pro, because with its fancy-schmancy new mini-LED display, it’s the tablet equivalent of the Hope Diamond. And AirTags? Because that’s their whole deal: tiny trackers to help you find stuff you usually end up misplacing.<br />At a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple executives announced all these products, plus a few more.<br />I wasn’t able to see any of it for myself—and I would have liked to have fixed my eyes on that fancy new iPad Pro screen and new iMac design—but that doesn’t mean I don’t already have preliminary thoughts to help you plan your spring spending. Here’s my take on all the new stuff, going from smallest to largest. Just don’t forget to watch for our full reviews, coming soon."
