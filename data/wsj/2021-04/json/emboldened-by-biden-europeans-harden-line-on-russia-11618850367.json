    "body": "BRUSSELS—As the Kremlin threatens Ukraine and Russia’s main opposition leader’s health deteriorates, some European countries want to follow the Biden administration’s lead and take a tougher line toward Moscow.<br />But the European Union’s major powers, France and Germany, want to stake out their own, more diplomatic relationship with Russia, independent of the U.S.<br />The Czech Republic and Poland have expelled Russian diplomats in recent days, accusing the Kremlin of malign activities in their countries. Some EU members such as the three Baltic countries want to send a clearer message to Russia warning of sanctions if the Kremlin uses the tens of thousands of troops it has deployed near Ukraine’s borders and in Crimea against its neighbor.<br />The U.K., which recently left the EU, and some rich but smaller EU members, including Denmark and the Netherlands, have for several years taken tougher lines against Moscow, but failed to sway the EU’s biggest members.<br />The Czech and Polish expulsions of diplomats last week followed the Biden administration’s new sanctions on Russia over election interference, a cyberattack and other malign activity. President Biden has set a clear tone on Russia since taking office, saying he considered Russian President Vladimir Putin a killer."
