    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Greta Van Fleet imagines a world where the ’90s never happened. In that decade, alternative acts like Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine and the Red Hot Chili Peppers combined the righteous energy of punk, the textural weight of heavy metal, and, later, the rhythmic force of hip-hop in songs that took on social issues or grappled with personal pain. Rock bands that followed are expected to reckon with these developments, but this four-piece outfit has chosen another path.<br />The group from Frankenmuth, Mich., comprising three brothers named Kiszka and a childhood friend—singer Josh and guitarist Jake are twins who turn 25 years old later this month; bassist and keyboardist Sam is 22, as is drummer Danny Wagner—draws influence almost exclusively from the peak album-rock era that stretched from roughly 1968 to 1980. We’re talking grinding blues riffs, yowling guitar solos, and lyrics inspired by science fiction and fantasy sung by young men with impossibly high and soaring voices."
