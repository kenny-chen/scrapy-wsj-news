    "body": "MOSCOW—Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny announced Friday that he would end a weekslong hunger strike after he received medical treatment and his doctors warned that continuing to refuse food could kill him.<br />Mr. Navalny, who is serving a 2½-year prison sentence for violating parole conditions, started his hunger strike on March 31 to protest poor treatment in prison and the refusal of authorities to allow him to see a doctor of his choice.<br />He was hospitalized at a facility within the prison system in Russia’s Vladimir region after doctors with ties to the opposition leader said medical test results showed he was at risk of imminent kidney failure and a possible heart attack.<br />In a message posted on his Instagram account Friday, Mr. Navalny said he had been examined twice by a council of civilian doctors and his own doctors, who had advised him to end the hunger strike because it was threatening his life.<br />He said doctors told him it would take 24 days to withdraw from the hunger strike and that process “is even harder.”"
