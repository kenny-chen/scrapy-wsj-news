    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation Thursday to expedite the Justice Department’s review of hate crimes in response to the recent wave of violence against Asian Americans.<br />The result of two weeks of substantive, bipartisan negotiations, the bill passed 94-1 on Thursday afternoon. The House is expected to consider the bill next month, according to a Democratic aide.<br />“I cannot tell you how important this bill is to the AAPI community, who often have felt very invisible in our country,” said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D., Hawaii), referring to the Asian American Pacific Islander community. “We in the Senate are going to stand with our AAPI community, and indeed any community that is discriminated against on the basis of race.”<br />The legislation would designate an official at the Justice Department to expedite the review of hate crimes. It also requires the attorney general to issue guidance to state and local law-enforcement agencies on how to establish online reporting for hate crimes, collect data and raise public awareness about hate crimes during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Anti-Asian hate crimes in 16 of the largest U.S. cities increased 149% between 2019 and 2020, according to an analysis by researchers at California State University, San Bernardino."
