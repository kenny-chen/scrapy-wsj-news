    "body": "Ever since she felt “railroaded” into having her two children by caesarean, she says, Linda Spencer has been eager to help expecting mothers.<br />This year she got her chance to singularly pursue this passion.<br />Ms. Spencer, who is 64, started working regularly as a doula in January at the Birth Sisters program at Boston Medical Center. A doula is a trained, nonclinical health professional who provides intellectual, physical and emotional support to mothers during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. Ms. Spencer underwent training and certification in 2019, and worked occasionally at the hospital last year.<br />Ms. Spencer says she first meets with people giving birth to discuss their needs. She teaches them about the labor process, breathing techniques and different positions, and about hydrotherapy and other options in assisting deliveries. “We are trying to create a calming environment to facilitate a positive and memorable birth experience,” she says. Then, once it is time, she is with the mother throughout labor.<br />Ms. Spencer was born near Boston Medical Center. “I grew up in that neighborhood, on welfare in the inner city. It’s important for me to be giving back to my community of origin,” she says. The hospital serves primarily low-income Black and Brown families, including some refugees and immigrants."
