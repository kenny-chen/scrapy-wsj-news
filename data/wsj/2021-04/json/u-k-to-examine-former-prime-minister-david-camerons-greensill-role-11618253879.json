    "body": "LONDON—The U.K. government on Monday announced an independent review into contracts it handed the now-defunct Greensill Capital and the role played by former Prime Minister David Cameron in lobbying on the company’s behalf for access to taxpayer funds just months before its collapse.<br />The government said that a review led by lawyer Nigel Boardman would look at the government’s use of supply-chain financing and Greensill, a spokesman for Downing Street said. The review will look at whether the company provided good value for taxpayers and how its contracts were secured.<br />Greensill’s implosion has spread damage across the world of finance, hitting its financing partner Credit Suisse Group AG and its biggest outside investor, a fund managed by  SoftBank Group Corp.<br />Greensill’s tight connections with the world of politics have also raised concerns about its relationships with government actors in the U.K. and elsewhere.<br />A representative for Greensill, which filed for bankruptcy last month after it lost credit insurance that was crucial to its business, declined to comment. Greensill had a contract to provide supply-chain financing, used by companies to stretch out the time they have to pay their bills, to the government-funded National Health Service."
