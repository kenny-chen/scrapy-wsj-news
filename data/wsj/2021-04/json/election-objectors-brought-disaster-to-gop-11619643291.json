    "body": "After the despicable events of Jan. 6, I have taken time to reflect upon whom I shall continue to support in the House of Representatives (“PACs Cut Funds to Election Objectors,” U.S. News, April 17). The Republicans who voted to decertify the last presidential election and haven’t publicly asked for forgiveness of their sins against our democracy will receive no support from me. They are delusional transgressors against our Constitution and an anathema to our Founding Fathers.<br />I am satisfied that I helped to elect additional Republicans to the Congress. How much better would it be if we had won at least one of the runoff Georgia Senate elections? The reason we lost both seats is Donald Trump’s shenanigans regarding a “stolen election” at the end of 2020, rather than focusing on the two Georgia Senate runoff elections.<br />When I listen to the tape of Mr. Trump begging and threatening for additional Georgia votes, I am sick to my stomach. That some House Republicans could also hear this banal insanity and not publicly denounce it disgusts me. I don’t understand why they won’t acknowledge their error so that the Republican Party can move on from this debacle.<br />David W. Heumann<br />San Gabriel, Calif."
