    "body": "BRUSSELS—NATO called for Russia to end a military buildup on its borders with Ukraine that has sparked concerns of a major escalation in the conflict between the two countries, which has simmered since the Kremlin invaded in 2014.<br />Jens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said Russia should withdraw tens of thousands of troops it has massed around Ukraine in recent weeks.<br />“Russia’s considerable military buildup is unjustified, unexplained, and deeply concerning,” Mr. Stoltenberg told a news conference after a meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “Russia must end this military buildup in and around Ukraine, stop its provocations, and de-escalate immediately.”<br />U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, also in Brussels Tuesday for consultations with allies, has warned of costs for Russia if it acts aggressively, without giving specifics.<br />“The U.S. stands firmly behind the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” Mr. Blinken said ahead of a meeting with Mr. Kuleba on Tuesday."
