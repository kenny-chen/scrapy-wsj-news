    "body": "SINGAPORE—In mid-March, a 26-year-old activist in a central Myanmar town began receiving phone calls from other young protesters, asking if he could help them slip secretly into the jungle.<br />Wai Moe Naing is part of a small, loose network of people who have begun helping protesters opposing the Feb. 1 coup train with rebel groups who have battled the country’s military for decades.<br />For two months, protesters have watched soldiers and police shoot hundreds of unarmed civilians in daylight and raid their homes by night. The brutal suppression has hobbled mass demonstrations that swept across the country after the coup.<br />A small but growing contingent no longer believes peaceful resistance is tenable, and they are turning to the many armed groups in the nation’s borderlands for help.<br />These groups belong to Myanmar’s ethnic minorities and have fought the military in long-running civil wars in their quest for greater autonomy. Some have now voiced support for the movement seeking to restore elected government, despite an uneasy relationship before the coup when they saw the civilian leadership as unresponsive to their concerns."
