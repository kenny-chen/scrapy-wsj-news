    "body": "Oatly Group AB has formally filed paperwork Monday for an initial public offering in the U.S., nine months after private-equity giant  Blackstone Group Inc.  and a handful high-profile celebrities took a stake in the oat milk producer.<br />The Malmö, Sweden-based company entered the U.S. market in 2017 with its alternative dairy products that have grown in popularity among consumers seeking healthier options with less impact on the environment.<br />Last July, The Wall Street Journal reported the company had sold a $200 million stake to a group led by Blackstone and included Oprah Winfrey, Natalie Portman, former Starbucks Corp. chief Howard Schultz and the entertainment company founded by Jay-Z. The sale of the roughly 10% stake valued Oatly at about $2 billion. In February, the oat-milk maker confidentially filed for an IPO in the U.S.<br />The retail value of the plant-based dairy industry in the Americas is expected to hit $7 billion by 2025, according to Euromonitor.<br />The growing appetite for plant-based alternatives has put pressure on dairy-milk companies like  Dean Foods Co. , which filed for bankruptcy in 2019. Meanwhile, companies focused on plant-based alternatives have seen demand from consumers and investors alike take off in recent years. For example, shares of plant-based food maker  Beyond Meat Inc.  have increased 441% since it went public in 2019."
