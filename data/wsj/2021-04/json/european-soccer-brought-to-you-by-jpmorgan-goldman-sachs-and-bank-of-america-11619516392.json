    "body": "JPMorgan Chase  & Co.’s role as the money behind the defunct soccer Super League in Europe shows the growing prominence of U.S. banks in the region’s economy, including the continent’s most beloved sport.<br />The move on European soccer is an extension of the growing dominance of American banks over their local banking rivals advising Europe Inc. Europe’s top five investment banks by revenue are U.S.-based, according to Dealogic.<br />American banks have brought in funding options used in U.S. sports that are considered innovative in a region more used to bread-and-butter lending deals. They are part of a broader group of financiers, including private equity, pension funds, insurance companies and other lenders, that are targeting the market for yield.<br />“The role of U.S. banks in financing European soccer is huge and it is growing,” said Pedro Trengrouse, a sports lawyer and coordinator of an international executive program in sports and soccer management backed by FIFA, soccer’s world governing body.<br />There is also pressure on European clubs to boost profitability by emulating the U.S. In Europe, clubs face the risk of being demoted to a lower, less lucrative league if they don’t play well."
