    "body": "HONG KONG—A monthslong legal fight by Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to obtain documents from  HSBC Holdings  PLC as part of her battle against extradition to the U.S. resulted in a settlement in a Hong Kong courtroom.<br />At a hearing in Hong Kong’s High Court on Monday, lawyers for Ms. Meng and HSBC confirmed that the two sides had struck a deal over the documents. Ms. Meng believes the papers will help her legal fight in Canada, where she is in hearings to try to prevent her extradition on charges related to alleged sanctions-busting sales to Iran.<br />Ms. Meng turned to the Hong Kong courts after losing an earlier legal battle in the U.K. to force HSBC to hand over the documents. Ms. Meng filed a legal action in Hong Kong in February, just days after a judge in London’s High Court declined to order HSBC to hand over the documents, saying he didn’t have the jurisdiction to do so.<br />In Hong Kong on Monday, Judge Linda Chan told the courtroom in a hearing lasting just a few minutes that she approved a deal between the two sides, including on how the documents will be redacted. Few details were disclosed.<br />While confirming an agreement had been reached, representatives for both Huawei and HSBC didn’t elaborate."
