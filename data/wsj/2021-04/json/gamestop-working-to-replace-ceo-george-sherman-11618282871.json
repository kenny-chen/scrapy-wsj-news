    "body": "GameStop Corp.  is looking to replace Chief Executive George Sherman, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of changes to the retailer’s leadership team since Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen became a board director in January.<br />The effort to replace Mr. Sherman, who has been the videogame retailer’s CEO for about two years, is being led by Mr. Cohen, the people said.<br />The company is focusing its search on candidates with a background in technology or the videogame industry, one of the people said. Mr. Cohen, 35 years old, isn’t planning on taking the role, the person said. Reuters earlier reported on GameStop’s plans to replace Mr. Sherman.<br />At least three top lieutenants of Mr. Sherman have left the company or announced plans to depart within the past few months. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that former finance chief Jim Bellwas forced out of his role, while customer chief Frank Hamlin resigned last month. GameStop has said merchandising chief Chris Homeister is resigning because of diminished responsibilities and will leave during the company’s fiscal second quarter.<br />GameStop has said its board is evaluating the skills of its leadership team and hired a third-party firm to help it in the process."
