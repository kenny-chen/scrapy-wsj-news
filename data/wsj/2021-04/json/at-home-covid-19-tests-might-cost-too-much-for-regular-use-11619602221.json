    "body": "Covid-19 tests for people to use to get quick results at home are finally becoming available to buy at pharmacies and retailers. Yet an obstacle might stand in the way of regular use: cost.<br />Many health authorities have been looking forward to the introduction of the fast-acting tests, which people could take at home to see if they are infected. The paper-strip tests also could help curb the spread of the coronavirus, supporters say, if people used them a few times a week.<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently cleared over-the-counter sales of two of these rapid at-home screening tests, one from  Abbott Laboratories  and another from  Quidel Corp.<br />Yet it appears the tests will cost consumers at least $20 for a pack of two, which health experts say is probably too pricey for frequent use.<br />Major pharmacies recently said they plan to sell a two-pack of Abbott’s test for nearly $24, while  Walmart  says it will charge just under $20. The price for Quidel’s test hasn’t been released, though Quidel has indicated it will be less than $30 for a pair."
