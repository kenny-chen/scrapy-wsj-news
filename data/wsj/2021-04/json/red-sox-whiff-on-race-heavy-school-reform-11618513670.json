    "body": "Fortunately for Red Sox fans, their World Series–winning rosters didn’t reflect the demographics of Boston (“The Red Sox Speak Up for Racial Engineering in Boston Schools,” op-ed, April 9). The team’s excellence wasn’t the result of mandated diversity. On the contrary, the diversity was the result of meritocracy—of making excellence the priority. That blacks, Latinos and Asians were prominent on these teams reflects their talent for, and interest in, baseball. And the underrepresentation of Jews and Narragansetts on those rosters shouldn’t suggest discrimination against them. In any institution and endeavor, all should have equal opportunity to excel—but as individuals, not as subjects of “racial engineering.”<br />Stanley Spatz<br />Hollywood, Fla.<br /><br />Mr. Stoll fails to mention one consequence of the new “ZIP Code quotas”: As minority families move out of poor neighborhoods and into better ones, they will find that their kids’ chances of enrolling in “exam schools” fall precipitously. In essence, they will be punished for striving for a better life."
