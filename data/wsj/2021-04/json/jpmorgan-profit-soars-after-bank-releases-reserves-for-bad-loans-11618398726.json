    "body": "JPMorgan Chase  & Co. said Wednesday that first-quarter profit nearly quintupled, after the bank released $5.2 billion it had set aside to cover soured loans.<br />The bank posted a profit of $14.3 billion, or $4.50 per share, well above the $3.10 per share forecast by analysts polled by FactSet. A year earlier, JPMorgan reported a quarterly profit of $2.87 billion, or $0.78 a share.<br />The nationâ€™s largest bank also reported revenue of $32.27 billion, up 14% from a year earlier. Revenue beat the $30.5 billion predicted by analysts.<br />After the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the U.S. early last year, JPMorgan and other big banks set aside billions of dollars to prepare for a potential flood of bad loans.<br />The rainy-day funds ate into quarterly profits for much of 2020. But many of those losses never materialized, and now banks are poised to cash in on their diligence. The bank also released $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter."
