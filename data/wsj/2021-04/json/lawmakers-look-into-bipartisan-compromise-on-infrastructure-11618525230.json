    "body": "WASHINGTON—Lawmakers began feeling out the possibility of reaching a compromise on an infrastructure package, as a bipartisan group held a call Thursday to discuss the issue and some Republicans began working on an alternative to President Biden’s $2.3 trillion plan.<br />The virtual meeting Thursday involved a group of roughly 20 lawmakers in both parties who helped kickstart negotiations on a roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid package late last year. It follows a series of meetings the White House has held with members of both parties on infrastructure, including one on Monday, when Mr. Biden indicated he was open to negotiation on the details of his proposal.<br />The White House is seeking to spend hundreds of billions on transportation infrastructure and expand broadband access, as well as other priorities like manufacturing and fixing school buildings, while raising taxes on corporations to cover the bill’s cost.<br />The bipartisan meeting on Thursday was largely a preliminary discussion of where lawmakers could find common ground, according to Sen. John Hickenlooper (D., Colo.), one of the attendees.<br />“At this point, we didn’t get anything done—we’re so preliminary, we really don’t know what the numbers are, so everyone’s going to look at what they’ve got over the weekend,” he said."
