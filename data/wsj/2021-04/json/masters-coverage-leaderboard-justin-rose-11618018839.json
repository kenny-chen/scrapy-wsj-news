    "body": "AUGUSTA, Ga.—Justin Rose began the second round of this Masters in a familiar position. That was good because he had a commanding lead and bad because of everything that has previously happened when he had the early lead here.<br />Rose, at 7-under par, still sits atop the leaderboard after 36 holes. For now.<br />His previously commanding lead after 18 holes became a considerably narrower one after 36 as Rose bounced through an uneven round while a growing group of competitors, including some of the world’s best golfers, started breathing down his neck.<br />Rose was 7 under after the first round too, when he posted that 65 on an opening Thursday that set him far afield from the field. He was four shots clear of just two other players at 3 under.<br />That lead vanished when Rose struggled on the front Friday, but a strong run on the back returned him to the top. The difference between Thursday and Friday is the crowd that’s now close to him."
