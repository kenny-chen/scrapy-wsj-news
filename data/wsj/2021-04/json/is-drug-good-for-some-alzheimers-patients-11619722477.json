    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Battle Over an Alzheimer’s Treatment” (April 20): My perspective is that of a man who lost his wife to Alzheimer’s after 10 years of hell on earth for both of us. It’s incomprehensible to me that the promising drug aducanumab isn’t approved already by the FDA, since every day of delay means another day of terrible hardship and suffering for millions of victims and their spouses and family caregivers.<br />The outside panel of scientists (none of whom specialize in treating Alzheimer’s patients) that advised the FDA to conduct another trial, which could take five or more years, “knows not what they do.” Since the drug already showed it did no harm, why not just give it now?<br />Edward Haas<br />Atlantic Beach, Fla.<br />"
