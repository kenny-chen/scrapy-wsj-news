    "body": "UnitedHealth  Group Inc. recorded stronger year-over-year revenue and profit figures for the first three months of 2021, driven by growth in its insurance programs for communities and seniors and its health-services business.<br />Although the coronavirus pandemic is still weighing on the healthcare industry, the Minnetonka, Minn.-based company said Thursday that its first-quarter results had boosted its outlook for the full year. UnitedHealth is the parent company for insurer UnitedHealthcare, as well as the Optum health-services business.<br />In the latest quarter, the number of people served by UnitedHealthcare’s medical plans grew by more than 1 million to 49.5 million, driven by expansion of the number of people on its Medicare Advantage plans.<br />A Medicaid contract award in Oklahoma, growth in specialty products such as dental and vision plans, and a strong selling season for commercial benefits also contributed to the insurance division’s first-quarter growth, UnitedHealth said.<br />UnitedHealth’s total revenue grew by 9% to $70.2 billion, up from $64.4 billion in the same three months a year earlier. Revenue from premiums improved to $55.49 billion, from $50.64 billion a year earlier."
