    "body": "Ann Althouse writing on her blog, April 12:<br /><br />“A new Reuters/Ipsos poll finds that 55% of Republicans falsely believe Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election was the result of illegal voting or rigging.” . . .<br />CNN reports, aggressively inserting the view that the people who were polled are wrong. I believe that’s a very unusual way to report an opinion poll, with insistence that the opinion is wrong and apart from any factual reporting that makes it perfectly obvious that the opinion is mistaken.<br />This displays a desperate fear of the opinion, and I don’t think it does much good. The urge to stamp the opinion out will tend to make those who hold it grip more tightly."
