    "body": "Dutch police arrested a 58-year-old man suspected of stealing a painting by Dutch master Vincent Van Gogh last year, although authorities have yet to locate the work of art.<br />Police said Tuesday the man is also suspected of stealing a painting by Frans Hals, another Dutch master. Both paintings were stolen last year from different museums in the Netherlands.<br />Neither painting—Van Gogh’s “Parish Garden in Nuenen, Spring,” and Hals’ “Two Laughing Boys”—has been located, the police said. The search for the two artworks continues, they said.<br />“This arrest is an important step in the investigation,” police said. Authorities didn’t disclose the name of the arrested man, who was held at his home in the Dutch town of Baarn. His lawyer couldn’t be located for comment.<br />Security flaws at museums and jaw-dropping prices paid for art are attracting a new generation of art thieves, say experts in art crime. While the potential payoff is limited because stolen art can never publicly be resold, it can nonetheless be sold on the black market."
