And they likely found time to pursue that passion project in between at-home working, schooling and caretaking. So it has never been more imperative to show our appreciation.<br />Make that Mother’s Day gift a thoughtful one whether you’re celebrating your own mom, the mother of your child, a grandmother, or a de facto mom. Below, our picks to help her indulge her pandemic pastime into the next year, from Jane Austen-inspired embroidery, to an apron fit for vintage-car restoration, to a candle-cum-herb-garden.<br />Did that needlework kit from last Mother’s Day quietly vanish after a few weeks of use? This year, take the hint, and go for the ready-made version. This summer-y poplin puff-sleeve from Sea New York comes with a removable crocheted vest, so that she can mix it up between crafty and classic depending on her mood. Sea New York Dress, $545, nordstrom.com<br />If your family’s not sick of each other yet, this subscription kit that combines charming art projects with illuminating art-history lessons is something you can enjoy together. Each month brings two new projects inspired by a different artist—past examples include a Matisse-esque vessel composed of colorful paper cutouts to a make-your-own doll kit inspired by folk-art fanatic Alexander Girard (pictured above). Art kit, from $32 per month, rainershine.love"
