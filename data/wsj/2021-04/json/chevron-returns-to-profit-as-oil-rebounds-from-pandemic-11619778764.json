    "body": "Chevron Corp.  swung to a profit for the first time in a year as the global energy industry starts to recover from the destruction of oil and gas demand wrought by the pandemic.<br />The second-largest U.S. oil company behind  Exxon Mobil Corp.  reported $1.4 billion in first-quarter profit, results that were boosted by sharply improved oil prices as countries around the world soften coronavirus restrictions.<br />Chevron’s net income was down about 62% from the same quarter last year, but a substantial increase from a $665 million loss in the previous quarter.<br />“Earnings strengthened primarily due to higher oil prices as the economy recovers,” Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in a statement.<br />Chevron’s profits were lower than expected by analysts, who predicted about $1.8 billion in net income, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Chevron’s refining and chemical units reported $5 million in profits, down from $1.1 billion a year ago, which Mr. Wirth attributed to the continuing impact of the pandemic and the February winter storm in Texas, which shut down much of the petrochemical complex along the Gulf of Mexico."
