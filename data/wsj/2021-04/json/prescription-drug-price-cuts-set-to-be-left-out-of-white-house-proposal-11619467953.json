    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House isn’t expected to include a measure aimed at lowering the price of prescription drugs in its coming antipoverty package, according to people familiar with the matter, in an omission likely to disappoint top Democrats on Capitol Hill.<br />President Biden will detail the roughly $1.8 trillion proposal during a speech to Congress later this week, rolling out another major spending plan weeks after he released a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan. While officials are still finalizing the plan, it is set to include funding for child care, universal pre-kindergarten and tuition-free community college, among other measures.<br />The new White House plan is also expected to include money for supporting Affordable Care Act programs, according to the people familiar with the plan. Democrats have been pushing to extend recently approved subsidies for people who buy ACA health plans, which lowered payments for almost 14 million people now insured on the individual market.<br />During a press briefing Monday, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese declined to comment on whether the plan would address prescription-drug prices.<br />“I am not going to confirm whether or not that is in,” Mr. Deese said. The rising cost of prescription drugs is “something that [Mr. Biden] continues to focus on and prioritize, but I’m going to let him speak to those issues in the speech,” he said."
