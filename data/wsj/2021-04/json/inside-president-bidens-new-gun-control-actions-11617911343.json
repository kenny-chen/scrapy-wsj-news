    "body": "President Biden has introduced a series of measures aimed at curbing gun violence, including efforts to crack down on untraceable weapons known as ghost guns and on arm braces that critics say allow AR-style pistols to function like rifles.<br />Gun legislation for years has been tied up in partisan and ideological fights, so the White House is seeking ways to act without Congress. Some Republicans and the National Rifle Association were critical of Mr. Biden’s moves.<br />Here is a look at what the president has proposed and what other gun-control measures are being debated in Washington.<br />Mr. Biden directed the Justice Department to issue a proposed rule aimed at stopping the proliferation of homemade ghost guns, which have grown in popularity in recent years. They can’t be traced in criminal investigations because they lack serial numbers. Law-enforcement officials say they appeal to criminals because all the parts can be purchased online and assembled without a background check. Gun-rights advocates say that such concerns are overblown and that homemade firearms are largely owned by hobbyists.<br />Mr. Biden said he wanted to see ghost-gun kits treated as firearms so that manufacturers would have to make key parts with serial numbers and buyers would have to undergo background checks."
