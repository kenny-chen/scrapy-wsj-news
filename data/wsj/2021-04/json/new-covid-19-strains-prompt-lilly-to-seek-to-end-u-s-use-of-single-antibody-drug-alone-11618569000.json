    "body": "Eli Lilly  & Co. has asked U.S. health regulators to revoke the authorization for use of its Covid-19 antibody drug bamlanivimab alone because it is less potent against certain coronavirus variants circulating in the U.S.<br />Instead, Lilly said Friday it will focus on distributing a drug cocktail containing bamlanivimab and a second antibody, named etesevimab, that studies indicate neutralize more of the emerging Covid-19 variants in the U.S. when given together than bamlanivimab alone.<br />The drugmaker’s request hints at the extent of the challenge that new strains of the virus could pose to treatments and vaccines. To stay ahead of any variants that could emerge able to evade currently available shots, health authorities have been racing to vaccinate as many people as possible.<br />Indianapolis-based Lilly said bamlanivimab alone should no longer be administered in the U.S. because of the variant challenge. The company said its request filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wasn’t due to any new safety concern.<br />“With the growing prevalence of variants in the U.S. that bamlanivimab alone may not fully neutralize, and with sufficient supply of etesevimab, we believe now is the right time to complete our planned transition and focus on the administration of these two neutralizing antibodies together,” Lilly Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky said."
