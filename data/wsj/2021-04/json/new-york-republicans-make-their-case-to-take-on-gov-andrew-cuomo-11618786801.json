    "body": "Two members of Congress, two former gubernatorial candidates and former Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s son will address a gathering of Republican leaders in Albany Monday, as the state party starts to settle its ticket for November—of 2022.<br />NYGOP Chairman Nick Langworthy said in an interview that his singular focus is defeating Gov. Andrew Cuomo in next year’s statewide elections, adding he hopes for a consensus about his party’s candidates before year’s end.<br />“It is imperative that we get the ball rolling,” said Mr. Langworthy.<br />There are now more than twice as many Democrats in the state as Republicans, and the GOP hasn’t won a statewide office since Gov. George Pataki was elected to a third term in 2002. Republicans also lost control of the state Senate majority in 2018, hampering the state party’s efforts to raise campaign money.<br />U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, who represents a district in eastern Long Island, on April 8 became the first major GOP candidate to declare a gubernatorial bid. His campaign said he raised $1 million on its first day of operations. In January, Mr. Cuomo reported he had $16.8 million in his war chest."
