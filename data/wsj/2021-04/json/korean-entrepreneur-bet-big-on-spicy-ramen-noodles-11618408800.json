    "body": "Shin Choon-ho had a hunch in the mid-1960s that instant ramen noodles could become a big business. He formed a company to make them despite opposition from his older brother, Shin Kyuk-ho, head of the family’s Lotte business group, who thought it was a terrible idea.<br />The brothers’ split was so bitter they never spoke again, according to colleagues. The younger Mr. Shin struck out on his own and gradually built a global company,  Nongshim Co. , whose name means farmer’s heart in Korean.<br />He favored beef broth, while Japanese rivals typically used chicken, and insisted retaining on fiery Korean flavors, even though colleagues feared American customers would buy only bland versions. Nongshim’s Shin Ramyun-brand noodles are now exported to more than 100 countries.<br />Sales boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic as people stuck at home embraced simple-to-prepare meals.<br />The brand also got a boost from the Oscar-winning movie “Parasite,” which includes a scene in which a housekeeper tosses cubed sirloin steak into a mixture of two types of Nongshim noodles, a popular Korean dish known as jjapaguri. Nongshim exploited the 2019 film’s success to launch a cup noodle version of the dish a year ago, bringing a Korean specialty to the world stage."
