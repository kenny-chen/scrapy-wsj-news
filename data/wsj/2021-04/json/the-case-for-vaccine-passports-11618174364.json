    "body": "The idea of a “vaccine passport,” which would let people prove they’re inoculated against Covid, has been swept up in a political debate over personal liberty. But this misunderstands how these apps are likely to be used. Passports would empower consumers by giving them more control over their own health information.<br />Millions of Americans now have index cards noting their vaccine lots and dates. But your doctor and health plan don’t necessarily have that information. The card could get lost and is easy to forge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires states to maintain databases as a condition of vaccine shipments. But there are more than 60 separate systems—some large states like Texas have a few, and New York City has its own. The record system uses an existing arrangement for childhood-vaccination programs: It was set up years ago so pediatricians can ask these sites for records that a child has been vaccinated.<br />The federal government needed to set up a record system quickly, before the country could reach a consensus about how consumers should store this information. Instead, states were asked to work off of the existing system with no obvious plan for consumer access; the priority was getting shots in arms.<br />In some cases, health plans are notified that you have received a vaccine, at least if you volunteer your insurance card when vaccinated. But that doesn’t help the millions who are uninsured or get the shot at a mass vaccination site or other nonstandard place like an optometrist’s office.<br />As a result, there’s no easy way to prove you’ve been vaccinated. You’d need cryptographically signed data that can’t easily be forged—a digital card that enables you to retrieve and store testing and vaccination information in a secure and verifiable way, via either an app or a QR code."
