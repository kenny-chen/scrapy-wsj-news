    "body": "On the eve of his 100th day in office, President Biden touted his achievements so far and laid out his legislative priorities in a joint address to Congress, stressing the need for massive federal investments in infrastructure, child care and education, paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy.<br />Here are some key takeaways from the speech:<br />Mr. Biden made his case that the federal investments he’s calling on Congress to pass are necessary to compete with autocratic countries like China. He pushed for funding to expand broadband, update infrastructure for drinking water and modernize the energy grid as part of the administration’s proposed American Jobs Plan, which he described as the “blue-collar blueprint to build America.”<br />“These are investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the government was in a position to make,” he said. “Time and again, they propel us into the future.”<br />Mr. Biden said Chinese President Xi Jinping and other world leaders believe democracies are too slow to compete with them. “The rest of the world isn’t waiting for us…. Doing nothing is not an option,” he said."
