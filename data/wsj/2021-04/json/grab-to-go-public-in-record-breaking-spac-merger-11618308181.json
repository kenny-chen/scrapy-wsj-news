    "body": "Grab Holdings Inc. said it would go public on the  Nasdaq Stock Market  by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, securing a near-$40 billion valuation in a new milestone for the SPAC boom that has swept U.S. financial markets.<br />The $39.6 billion deal to list Grab, a ride-hailing, food-delivery and digital-wallet group that operates across much of Southeast Asia, is by far the biggest involving a blank-check company and means Grab’s valuation has more than doubled in just 18 months. The merger also comes alongside a $4 billion-plus fundraising, which is the largest-ever share sale by a Southeast Asian company in the U.S.<br />Singapore-headquartered Grab said Tuesday it would merge with  Altimeter Growth Corp. , a SPAC sponsored by Altimeter Capital, of Menlo Park, Calif., confirming details reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The Grab merger adds to a frenzy of SPAC-related deal making. A record $99 billion has been raised in the U.S. by a total of 306 SPACs this year, according to SPAC Research data, and some 435 of these vehicles are still seeking a merger target.<br />As part of the deal, more than $4 billion has been committed in a so-called PIPE, a type of funding round that typically accompanies such mergers with blank-check companies. PIPE stands for “private investment in public equity.” Grab will receive a maximum of about $4.5 billion in cash from the transaction."
