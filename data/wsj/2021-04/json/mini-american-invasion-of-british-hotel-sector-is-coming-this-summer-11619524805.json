    "body": "U.K. hotels are gearing up for more visitors after a terrible 2020. A number of luxury or boutique U.S. hotel operators are ready to check in.<br />The Mondrian, the NoMad and the Graduate are among the brands that are planning to open new U.K. properties over the summer. They are betting that a mix of cultural tourists from abroad and stir-crazy locals eager to travel again will fill their rooms.<br />“Luxury travel will always gravitate towards London,” said Chadi Farhat, chief operating officer of the Los Angeles-headquartered SBE Entertainment Group. “London remains buoyant and a global capital of art, culture, architecture, food and drink, and commerce.”<br />His group is poised to open the 120-room Mondrian Hotel in the east London neighborhood of Shoreditch this summer, with suites costing as much as £1,099 a night, equivalent to $1,500.<br />Graduate Hotels, the Chicago-based operator of 30 lodging properties in U.S. college towns, said it would soon open its first European outposts in the England university cities of Oxford and Cambridge. Chief Executive Ben Weprin believes that Britons prevented from traveling overseas this summer will opt to staycation instead."
