    "body": "LONDON—Royal Dutch  Shell  PLC said gains it made from higher oil prices in the first quarter would be partly offset by disruption related to the winter storm in Texas, knocking the energy giant’s recovery from the pandemic.<br />The company said Wednesday that the cold snap had hurt its production, refining and chemicals operations in the state, and would reduce earnings by around $200 million.<br />The unusually cold weather left millions of Texans without power and resulted in outages at refineries and chemical plants, disrupted pipeline flows, and froze oil and natural-gas wells.<br />Despite the disruption, Shell and other big oil companies are looking to mount a recovery this year after reporting some of their worst results on record for 2020. Covid-19 lockdowns sapped demand for oil, sending prices lower, prompting Shell and its peers to reduce costs, shrink workforces and cut dividends.<br />“In actual results the turning point will more likely be the second quarter,” said Jason Kenney, an analyst at Spanish bank Santander, adding that energy companies’ profitability should continue to improve in the second half of the year given cost cutting and the higher oil prices."
