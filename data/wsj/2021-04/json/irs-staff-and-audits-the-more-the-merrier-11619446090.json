    "body": "In “The $1 Trillion Tax Evasion Opportunity” (Politics & Ideas, April 21), William A. Galston makes it sound like there is $1 trillion sitting in a cave somewhere. If the government hires 5,000 Internal Revenue Service sleuths and finds it, then we can pay for some of President Biden’s giveaway. But the $1 trillion isn’t in a hiding place. It is in the pockets of millions of Americans. They use it to spend, spurring the economy. Transferring that $1 trillion to the government may not be an improvement.<br />F.A. D’Ambrosio<br />Concord, Mass.<br /><br />Mr. Galston cites Charles O. Rossotti’s plan to collect more in taxes. Mr. Rossotti was the first IRS commissioner in a long time who was not a tax professional. He was a successful businessman who ran the IRS like a business, not a bureaucracy. Lawmakers should pay close attention to what he has to say."
