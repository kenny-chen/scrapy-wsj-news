    "body": "Defaults by low-rated U.S. companies have fallen to their lowest level in 10 months, helping to extend sharp rallies in the markets for junk bonds and floating-rate loans.<br />Defaults for an index of speculative-grade loans to U.S. companies over the past year fell to 3.15% as of March, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence’s LCD. That is the lowest level since last April and down from the measure’s 10-year peak in September at 4.17%.<br />The decline in defaults has helped fuel a strong recovery in the prices of markets that initially were hammered by the Covid-inspired flight from risk. The average yield on a Bloomberg Barclays index of junk bonds as of Thursday was 3.9%, around 0.1 percentage point above the record low of February. Yields fall when bond prices rise.<br />Loan prices are also rising. The share of loans to North American companies trading at less than 90 cents on the dollar was 4.35% as of April 7, according to Refinitiv—down from 5.18% a month ago and a peak of 75.9% during last year’s selloff.<br />Lower interest rates and investors’ demand for higher yielding credit assets have helped companies buy time to improve operations, said Steven Oh, head of global credit at PineBridge Investments."
