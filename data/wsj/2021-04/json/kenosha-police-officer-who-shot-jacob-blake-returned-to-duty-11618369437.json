    "body": "KENOSHA, Wis.—A white police officer from Wisconsin who was investigated and cleared for shooting and injuring a Black man during a domestic dispute has returned from administrative leave, officials said Tuesday.<br />Kenosha Officer Rusten Sheskey wasn’t charged in the August 2020 incident that left Jacob Blake paralyzed from the waist down. Mr. Sheskey shot Mr. Blake seven times while Mr. Blake was about to get into an SUV.<br />Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis said in a statement that Mr. Sheskey returned to duty on March 31. The statement said Mr. Sheskey was found to have been acting within policy and won’t be disciplined.<br />“Although this incident has been reviewed at multiple levels, I know that some will not be pleased with the outcome; however, given the facts, the only lawful and appropriate decision was made,” Mr. Miskinis said in the statement.<br />Mr. Sheskey and two other Kenosha officers were trying to arrest Mr. Blake on an outstanding warrant when a pocketknife fell from his pants during a scuffle. Mr. Blake said he picked it up before heading to a vehicle to drive away with two of his children in the back seat. He said he was prepared to surrender once he put the knife in the vehicle."
