    "body": "As  Microsoft  is learning early, $2 trillion comes with a price.<br />The software giant has been flirting with that market value all month—coming closest on Tuesday ahead of its fiscal third quarter results. The stock ended the day within about 1% of that milestone, where it would have joined Apple Inc. in the rarefied air of $2 trillion enterprises.<br />Alas, it wasn’t quite to be. Microsoft’s results were solid enough; the company reported its best revenue growth since 2017. But that beat Wall Street’s consensus forecast by less than 2% compared with the 7% beat delivered by Google-parent  Alphabet Inc.  on the same afternoon.<br />Microsoft’s operating income gain of 31% year-over-year also paled next to the internet advertising titan’s 106% bottom line boost. The two had been the best performing stocks of the big tech bunch for the year to date ahead of their respective reports on Tuesday.<br />In a frothy market, though, only blowout results seem to count. Microsoft’s share price was down 3% Wednesday morning."
