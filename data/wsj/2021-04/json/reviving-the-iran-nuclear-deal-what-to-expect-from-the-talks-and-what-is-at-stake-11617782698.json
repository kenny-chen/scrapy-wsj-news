    "body": "Diplomats from the U.S. and Iran converged in Vienna in early April in an attempt to revive the beleaguered 2015 nuclear agreement, the first potential thaw in diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington since the Trump administration left the accord in 2018.<br />As the second round of talks kicked off on April 15, American and Iranian officials were still not meeting directly, but were working through European intermediaries, who also gathered in the Austrian capital alongside representatives from the other parties to the deal, Russia and China.<br />The meetings in Vienna marked a diplomatic breakthrough and were seen by Western diplomats as a necessary first step toward salvaging a deal that put limits on Iran’s nuclear activity in return for sanctions relief. After leaving the nuclear accord, the Trump administration imposed heavy sanctions on Iran.<br />Participants on all sides said the first meetings had been constructive and agreed to meet again in Vienna this week.<br />However, the second round of talks began in the shadow of an attack Sunday on Iran’s main nuclear facility in Natanz, and Tehran’s response, which was to increase its uranium enrichment to 60%, bringing it closer than ever to weapons grade of 90%."
