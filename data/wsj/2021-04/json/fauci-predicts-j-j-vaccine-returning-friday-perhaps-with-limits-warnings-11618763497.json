    "body": "President Biden’s chief medical adviser said he expects  Johnson & Johnson ’s  Covid-19 vaccine to return to use in the U.S. by Friday, after a pause because of concerns about blood clots in several patients.<br />“I would be very surprised…if we don’t have a resumption in some form by Friday,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told CBS’s “Face the Nation,” echoing remarks he made on other networks Sunday.<br />U.S. health authorities on Tuesday recommended suspending use of J&J’s single-dose shot out of an abundance of caution while they investigate reports of the six women who got the vaccine and afterward developed serious blood clots. The women were between 18 and 48 years old. One died.<br />More than 7.2 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been administered in the U.S.; about 1.5 million of those doses went to women between the ages of 18 and 50.<br />J&J said Friday there wasn’t enough evidence to establish that the company’s Covid-19 vaccine causes the rare blood-clotting condition that prompted U.S. health officials this week to recommend a pause in its use."
