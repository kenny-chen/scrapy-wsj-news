    "body": "A powerful recovery in the U.S., primed by massive government spending and a rapid vaccine rollout, is already rippling around the world, brightening the economic prospects for countries closely tied to the American economy.<br />But economists say the coming U.S. boom could presage a two-speed recovery from the extraordinary economic downturn of the past year, a schism that threatens to open fissures in the global economy.<br />While lockdowns and Covid-19 restrictions hit many economies last year in roughly equal measure, early evidence shows that the exit from the pandemic could be greatly lopsided.<br />Rich countries and some export-driven economies are already enjoying the early fruits of successful vaccine campaigns and resurgent growth.<br />Instead, poor nations are seeing nascent signs of capital outflows being lured to rich countries.
