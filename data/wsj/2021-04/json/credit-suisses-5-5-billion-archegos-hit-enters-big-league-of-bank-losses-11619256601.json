    "body": "Credit Suisse Group AG’s  $5.5 billion loss from Archegos Capital Management puts it into the big league of banking mishaps with the likes of Nick Leeson, Jérôme Kerviel and the “London whale.”<br />Archegos, the U.S. family investment firm of former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, took huge bets on a few stocks with money borrowed from Credit Suisse and other banks. When some large positions reversed and Archegos couldn’t meet margin calls, it triggered one of the biggest sudden losses in Wall Street history.<br />In addition to Credit Suisse,  Nomura Holdings Inc.  warned investors of a $2 billion loss from Archegos.  Morgan Stanley  wrote down $911 million related to the firm and Japanese bank  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group  warned of a $300 million loss.<br />But Credit Suisse took the brunt of the damage. Its business with Archegos was larger relative to its size than other banks, The Wall Street Journal has reported.<br />Credit Suisse and Mr. Hwang had a long relationship. The bank was a prime broker to his hedge fund Tiger Asia Management. The fund pleaded guilty to wire-fraud charges related to insider trading of Chinese stocks in 2012, and Mr. Hwang was barred by U.S. securities regulators from managing client money."
