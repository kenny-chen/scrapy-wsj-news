    "body": "The documentary series “Wahl Street” was supposed to follow actor Mark Wahlberg while he navigated his role in several up-and-coming businesses. But the show instead depicts a celebrity watching his big plans collapse during the pandemic.<br />“It’s a much more honest depiction of where I’m at in life,” Mr. Wahlberg said in an interview. “I’ve certainly learned more from the failures and the losses than I have the victories. Social media people are always showing you all these great successes, and I want to show the journey, the struggle, the learning curve, the bumps in the road.”<br />He puts it more bluntly in the series.<br />“Do you know why this show’s going to be such a hit?” he asks the camera crew after a tense business meeting. “People are going to love watching me f—implode.”<br />Big stars often don’t like talking publicly about their money. It is a taboo subject even though celebrities regularly diversify into businesses beyond entertainment, from Reese Witherspoon’s clothing line to Rihanna’s lingerie and beauty brands to Ashton Kutcher’s venture-capital firms to Kanye West’s push into fashion and footwear."
