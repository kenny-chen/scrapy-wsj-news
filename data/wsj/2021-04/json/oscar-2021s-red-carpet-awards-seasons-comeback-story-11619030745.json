There won’t be bleachers where fans can gather and cheer this year. And the ranks of photographers and media for “Who are you wearing?” interviews will be considerably cut back.<br />To many stylists, the Oscars ceremony is a symbolic turning of a corner in the pandemic. “It’s a glimpse of returning to normalcy to people,” said New York-based stylist Chloe Hartstein, who will be in Los Angeles to dress best supporting actress nominee Glenn Close for the event. “It’s a little glimpse of our old lives.”"
