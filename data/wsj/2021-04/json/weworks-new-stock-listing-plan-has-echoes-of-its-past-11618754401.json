    "body": "WeWork, which had one of the most spectacular IPO implosions in recent years, is trying to go public again. While it is a far tamer company than it was in 2019, some of the factors that raised concerns among regulators on the first deal are back again.<br />This time, WeWork isn’t doing an initial public offering. Instead it will start trading on a stock exchange by merging with a so-called special-purpose acquisition company. Rules around SPACs are looser than for IPOs, giving WeWork more leeway to tout its future.<br />The shared-office provider is expected to merge with a SPAC called  BowX Acquisition Corp.  later this year. As the two entities promoted the deal to investors, they painted an optimistic scenario for the company’s growth and profitability.<br />BowX’s chairman described WeWork in a call with investors as a $5 billion revenue company, though that figure is a projection rather than a current number. When describing WeWork’s size, the company counted units that WeWork doesn’t own directly.<br />WeWork is predicting a rapid recovery from the pandemic downturn, which hit its business particularly hard because few people were using offices, much less shared space, and because it was still on the hook for long-term leases. The company is also using a new profit measure that shows higher margins than it claimed in late 2019."
