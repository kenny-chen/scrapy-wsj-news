    "body": "WASHINGTON—Capitol Police officials called for hiring more officers and bolstering training in two congressional hearings Wednesday about overhauling the force in response to the Jan. 6 riot, in which a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol.<br />Michael Bolton, the Capitol Police’s inspector general, spoke to the House Administration Committee, which oversees security on the House side of the Capitol complex. Yogananda Pittman, the acting chief of the Capitol Police, and other Capitol security officials appeared before a Senate subcommittee about the police force’s funding.<br />Mr. Bolton recently issued an internal report that found multiple intelligence failures by the police department leading up to the riot. The report also described failures to use all available equipment to protect the Capitol.<br />A mob of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters overwhelmed police officers and breached the Capitol to protest a vote certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 presidential election. One protester was shot and killed by police during the riot.<br />Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died a day after the riot of a stroke, according to a medical examiner’s report that didn’t link his death to the events of Jan. 6. Two rioters died of heart conditions, and another died of an amphetamine intoxication, the medical examiner’s office has said."
