    "body": "In the remarkable season when Wilt Chamberlain averaged 50 points and scored 100 points in a game, he also set another mind-boggling but more obscure NBA record: He attempted 12.6 free throws per 36 minutes. Teams couldn’t stop him. So they fouled him.<br />For such a reliable indicator of his dominance, his free-throw rate in 1962 is mostly lost to history. How often he found himself at the foul line is not a round number that rolls off the tongue. It’s not even a record that Chamberlain would have known about, considering this particular statistic hadn’t been calculated yet.<br />But like his 50-point season and 100-point game, his free-throw rate was untouchable. It was as if Chamberlain were holding it high above his head and it would take another very large human being to snatch it away—someone, as it happens, like Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid.<br />Nearly six decades after Chamberlain went to the foul line with more frequency than anybody in NBA history, there is finally somebody who is threatening to do something that not even he ever did. Embiid is taking 13.2 free throws per 36 minutes.<br />But what happens next is what distinguishes Embiid from Wilt Chamberlain, Shaquille O’Neal and so many of the league’s indomitable big men. He actually makes his free throws."
