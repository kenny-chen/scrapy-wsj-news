    "body": "Regarding Charles A. Donovan and Robert G. Marshall’s op-ed “Margaret Sanger Was a Eugenicist to the End” (April 22): Planned Parenthood’s past support of eugenics is abominable, but there is a world of difference between having the government decide who can be a parent and those parents choosing for themselves.<br />There are people for whom having a child with a major disability has been a gift, but there are also parents who have ended up divorced and exhausted, with no options to give them some relief from the 24-hour needs of some children, and no idea what will happen when they, the parents, die. Maybe Messrs. Donovan and Marshall can focus on creating these badly needed and expensive services before they dictate to women and men, rather like Sanger herself did.<br />Laurie Goldman<br />Birmingham, Mich.<br />"
