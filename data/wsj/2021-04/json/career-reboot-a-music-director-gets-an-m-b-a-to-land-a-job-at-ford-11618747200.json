    "body": "Mitchell Owens was working as the music director for a number of Catholic churches near Milwaukee when he realized he just wouldn’t be able to earn a salary high enough to support his two toddler sons.<br />After getting a full scholarship to Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business’s full-time M.B.A. program, he bet that the degree would help him shift into a new, higher-paying role in business. Mr. Owens moved with his family to East Lansing, Mich., got a part-time job at a local church, and took out about $40,000 in federal loans to help cover his living expenses.<br />It was a sharp turn from his original career dream: Mr. Owens, 35 years old and a Detroit native, had fallen in love with music at an early age. After participating in activities like his school’s choir and drama club, he decided to pursue it professionally.<br />“I wanted to perform for a living,” he said. “I loved doing it, even starting in middle school when I started learning piano.”<br />He enrolled at Wayne State University in Detroit to study theater but switched to music after a year. To earn money on the side, Mr. Owens took an assistant music director position at a local Catholic church. “It was better than waiting tables,” he said."
