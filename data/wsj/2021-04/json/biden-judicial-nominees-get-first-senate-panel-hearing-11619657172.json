    "body": "WASHINGTON—Racial and professional diversity in the federal judiciary were central topics during a Senate hearing Wednesday for five of President Biden’s judicial nominees, including one who could eventually be a candidate for the Supreme Court.<br />The Senate Judiciary Committee, holding its first judicial confirmation hearing since Mr. Biden took office, heard from two nominees for federal appeals roles: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, nominated for a prominent appeals court in Washington; and lawyer Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, tapped for a seat on the Chicago-based Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.<br />If confirmed, Judge Jackson would replace Attorney General Merrick Garland on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.<br />The committee also heard from three nominees for U.S. district courts, the trial courts in the federal system, including Zahid Quraishi, who would become the first Muslim-American to hold such a post. All five nominees are people of color, reflecting Mr. Biden’s pledge to diversify the federal bench.<br />Much of the hearing focused on Judge Jackson and Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi, both Black women who have experience as federal public defenders representing indigent criminal defendants."
