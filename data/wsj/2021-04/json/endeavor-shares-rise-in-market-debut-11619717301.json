    "body": "Shares of  Endeavor Group Holdings Inc.  ended their first day of trading up 5%, capping off a two-year effort by the entertainment firm to go public.<br />Endeavor’s stock closed Thursday at $25.20, compared with its initial public offering price of $24, and giving the company a valuation of $10.8 billion. Endeavor’s shares opened at $27.<br />The company, known for representing Hollywood’s biggest talents such as Dwayne Johnson and Charlize Theron, also owns the giant sports and modeling agency IMG Worldwide Inc. and the Miss Universe pageant. In 2016, Endeavor bought part of Zuffa LLC, owner and operator of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.<br />“As far as where the world is going, we’re in every right sector right now,” Endeavor’s Chief Executive Ari Emanuel said in an interview Thursday. He said the company is well positioned to attract investors interested in stocks that stand to benefit from a global economy that is reopening.<br />Last month, the company said it was once again pursuing an IPO, after calling off a plan to go public in 2019. Endeavor publicly filed for an IPO in May 2019 but tabled those plans later in the year after WeWork’s parent company had a high-profile shelving of its offering, and  Peloton Interactive Inc.’s  debut fizzled."
