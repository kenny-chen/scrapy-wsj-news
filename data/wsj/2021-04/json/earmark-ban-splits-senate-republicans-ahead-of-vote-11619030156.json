    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans remain torn over whether to lift their conference’s decadelong moratorium on earmarks, with a fraught closed-door vote on whether to keep the ban expected late Wednesday.<br />Earmarks allow lawmakers to direct federal agencies to spend specific amounts on projects in their home states or districts, but fraud and misuse over the years made the practice politically toxic.<br />At least 18 of the 50 Republican senators have signed onto a letter circulated by Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) pledging support for keeping the party’s ban in place. “We will not participate in an inherently wasteful spending practice that is prone to serious abuse,” the letter reads.<br />Even if a majority of GOP senators vote to keep the ban, the prohibition is nonbinding, and some say they still plan to take advantage of the practice regardless of the result.<br />“I’m gonna do what I think is right for South Dakota,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.). “I just think that this is a case of where you want to make sure it’s aboveboard, and everybody knows what you’re doing.”"
