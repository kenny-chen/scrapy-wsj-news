    "body": "<br />WASHINGTON—President Biden will make his case to world leaders Thursday that the U.S. is committed to sharply cutting its greenhouse-gas emissions over the next decade and plans to challenge other nations to take ambitious steps to tackle climate change.<br />At 8 a.m., the White House will kick off a two-day virtual climate summit aimed at jump-starting negotiations for a global deal to curb emissions world-wide. The event will feature 40 heads of state, with allies and rivals such as Russia and China among them.<br />Administration officials said Mr. Biden will use the summit to unveil a new target that calls for U.S. emissions to be 50% to 52% lower in 2030 than levels in 2005, a common baseline for such climate targets.<br />Many nations’ leaders are skeptical of American promises on climate following decades of sharp policy shifts, including President George W. Bush abandoning the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and President Donald Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate deal that President Barack Obama played a central role in negotiating in 2015."
