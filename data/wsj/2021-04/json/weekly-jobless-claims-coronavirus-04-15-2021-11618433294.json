    "body": "Unemployment claims likely resumed their decline as the U.S. economic revival picked up speed.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect that the Labor Department will report that jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, fell to 710,000 last week from 744,000 a week earlier.<br />That would be down from a recent high of about 900,000 a week in January, but still way above the levels of around 220,000 that prevailed early last year, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. economy.<br />“The labor market is on a recovery path,” said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at the job site Indeed. “The recovery is 100% tied to the public health situation,” she added.<br />The economy is showing signs of improvement as vaccination rates power consumer spending, governments relax restrictions on businesses, and households and federal-stimulus funds flow through the economy."
