    "body": "Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick suffered a stroke and died of natural causes, the medical examiner’s office in Washington, D.C., said Monday, answering a question that has lingered since the officer died a day after he was assaulted during the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.<br />The office concluded that Mr. Sicknick’s manner of death was natural, adding in an explanation: “If death is hastened by an injury, the manner of death is not considered natural.”<br />Two men were arrested last month on charges of assaulting Mr. Sicknick with a chemical spray, but prosecutors and the medical examiner didn’t link the spray to the officer’s subsequent death.<br />After being sprayed with the substance around 2 p.m. on Jan. 6, Mr. Sicknick collapsed at the Capitol around 10 p.m. and was transported to a hospital, where he died at about 9:30 p.m. the following night, according to the examiner’s office. He was 42 years old.<br />The Capitol Police had said he was injured while protecting Congress from a mob of Trump supporters who stormed the building, saying that Mr. Sicknick had “succumbed to his injuries” after being taken to the hospital. But the force hadn’t explained how he died, sparking persistent questions from lawmakers and others about what happened."
