    "body": "U.S. government bond prices pulled back Tuesday, reflecting the impact of an auction of seven-year debt and the looming conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 1.622%, the highest since April 14, compared with 1.568% Monday.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, edged higher in the morning, climbed more steeply heading into the $62 billion auction of seven-year notes and took another turn higher shortly after the auction.<br />Seven-year note auctions are currently the largest of any maturity and had attracted weak demand in recent months, especially in February when the notes were sold at significantly higher yields than traders were expecting. Tuesday’s sale drew more interest from investors. But the large influx of new debt still appeared to weigh on Treasurys, as did the Fed meeting, analysts said.<br />For months, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said that the time wasn’t right to even begin thinking about tightening monetary policy by reducing the amount of bonds that the central bank buys each month. Despite improvement in the economy, he has noted that U.S. employment remains well short of its pre-pandemic level."
