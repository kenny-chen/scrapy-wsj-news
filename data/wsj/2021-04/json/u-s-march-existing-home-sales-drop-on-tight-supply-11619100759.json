    "body": "The relentless climb in U.S. home prices and tightening supply threaten to cool the hottest housing market in 15 years, sending frustrated home buyers to the sidelines.<br />The median price for existing home sales rose to $329,100 in March, a new high according to the National Association of Realtors. Prices soared 17.2% last month from a year earlier, marking the biggest price increase in NAR data going back to 1999.<br />Steepening prices, combined with a scarcity of inventory that has left the U.S. housing market millions of homes short of buyer demand, have taken some steam out of the market at the start of the peak spring selling season.<br />NAR said Thursday that existing-home sales dropped 3.7% in March from February, the second straight month of sales declines.<br />The supply constraints are creating a fiercely competitive bidding climate where homes are sitting on the market for shorter periods than ever before. The typical home that sold in March spent only 18 days on the market, the fastest pace on record, NAR said."
