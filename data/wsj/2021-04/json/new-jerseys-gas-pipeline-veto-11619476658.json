    "body": "The Biden Administration is no fan of fossil fuels. But even it disagrees with New Jersey’s slick argument in a case the Supreme Court will hear Wednesday that the Constitution gives states a veto over interstate gas pipelines that trumps federal regulatory and judicial review.<br />At issue in PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New Jersey is a 116-mile pipeline between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the pipeline after a two-year review that involved more than 200 meetings with public officials. Some 70 variations were made to the route during the review.<br />New Jersey sought to block the pipeline by invoking its sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to block the condemnation of 42 state parcels of land needed to build the pipeline.<br />Once FERC certifies a pipeline, the Natural Gas Act delegates the federal government’s eminent domain power to the pipeline company. Other federal laws delegate federal eminent domain power to private parties to build railroads and transmission lines, though many explicitly carve out state property. The Natural Gas Act has no such carve-out.<br />Yet New Jersey argues in the case now before the High Court that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits states from being sued by private parties in federal court. Ergo, PennEast Pipeline can’t use FERC’s eminent domain delegation to condemn state sovereign property in federal court."
