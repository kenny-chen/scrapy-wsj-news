Weâ€™d like to hear from you in the form below.<br />In your proposal, describe how you will express yourself: you can write a letter or poem, or create photos, video, artwork, animation, audiofiles or a song, etc. We will select the best proposals and ask the winners for the full submission. The responses will run on our website and be featured in the paper timed to graduation in June.<br /><br /><br />"
