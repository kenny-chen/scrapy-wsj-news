    "body": "Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc picked its chairman to lead its ticket at this fall’s German election, opting for continuity over a more popular politician in a move that could complicate its attempt to retain control of the chancellery.<br />Ms. Merkel, one of the longest-serving democratic leaders of the postwar era, will bow out of politics after 16 years as chancellor in September.<br />Armin Laschet, chairman of Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, will lead the bloc’s election bid.<br />Mr. Laschet has generally supported Ms. Merkel’s centrist, sometimes left-leaning, brand of conservatism. He has backed her liberal asylum policy and her championing of economic ties to China and Russia despite U.S. objections.<br />Yet the 60-year-old, who became chairman in January, is relatively unpopular with voters. A recent representative poll by Forsa found that 35% of conservative voters would either vote for another party or abstain in September if he were nominated. Only 19% would like to see Mr. Laschet become chancellor, the poll found."
