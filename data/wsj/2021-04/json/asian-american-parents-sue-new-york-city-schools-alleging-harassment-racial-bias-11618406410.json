    "body": "Depositions will soon begin in a case in which five Asian-American parents of New York City public school students are suing the city’s Education Department, claiming they were harassed while protesting against the proposed changes to the agency’s gifted and talented admissions process.<br />The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status and names Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York Police Department, claims that at a DOE town hall meeting in Brooklyn in February 2020 about the controversial gifted program, the agency “treated Asian-Americans differently from non-Asians by prohibiting, restricting and/or limiting Asian-Americans’ access” to the meeting.<br />The parents and their co-plaintiff, the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York, also allege that they were unfairly detained in retaliation for protesting outside the building before the meeting. Depositions are scheduled to begin next week in the case, which was filed in January.<br />Plaintiff Siu-Lin Linda Lam was “physically grabbed by police officers and school security agents and prevented from going inside the school building,” according to the group’s lawyer, Laura Barbieri.<br />DOE spokeswoman Katie O’Hanlon declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said no one was denied access to the meeting on any discriminatory basis."
