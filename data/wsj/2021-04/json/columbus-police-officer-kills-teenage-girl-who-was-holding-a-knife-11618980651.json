    "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio—Police shot and killed a teenage girl who swung at two other people with a knife on Tuesday, according to bodycam footage from the officer who fired the shots, just minutes before the verdict in George Floyd’s killing was read.<br />Officials with the Columbus Division of Police showed a segment of the bodycam footage Tuesday night, just hours after the shooting took place in a neighborhood on the city’s east side. The decision to swiftly release the video was a departure from protocol as the force faces scrutiny from the public following a series of recent high-profile police killings that have led to clashes.<br />The 10-second clip begins with the officer getting out of his car at a house where police had been dispatched after someone called 911 saying they were being physically threatened, Interim Police Chief Michael Woods said at the news conference. The officer takes a few steps toward a group of people in the driveway when the girl, who was Black, starts swinging a knife wildly at another girl or woman, who falls backward. The officer shouts several times at her.<br />The girl with the knife then charges at another girl or woman who is pinned against a car.<br />From a few feet away, with people on either side of him, the officer fires four shots and the teen slumps to the ground. A black-handled blade similar to a kitchen knife or steak knife lies on the sidewalk next to her."
