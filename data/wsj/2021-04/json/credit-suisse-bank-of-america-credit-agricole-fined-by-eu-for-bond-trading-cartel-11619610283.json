    "body": "The European Union fined  Credit Suisse Group AG ,  Bank of America Corp.  and Crédit Agricole SA for illegally colluding on trades in government bond markets at the expense of their clients.<br />The three banks were together fined €28.5 million, equivalent to $34.4 million.  Deutsche Bank AG  also participated in the trades, but wasn’t fined because it alerted the EU about the existence of the alleged cartel.<br />The EU’s executive arm said Wednesday that traders at the banks worked together on trading strategies, exchanged sensitive price information and coordinated prices for sovereign bonds denominated in dollars.<br />“The cartel harmed the financial markets,” said Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission. She said the trading restricted competition when fund managers bought and sold bonds on behalf of investors and retirees.<br />The trading took place in secondary markets, where bonds are bought and sold between banks and investors after they have been issued. The issuers include European institutions, governments and agencies such as the European Investment Bank and German state, as well as non-European sovereign and agency issuers."
