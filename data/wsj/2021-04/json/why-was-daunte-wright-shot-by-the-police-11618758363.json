    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Shooting of Daunte Wright” (April 14): As a parent and educator, I try to prepare my children and students to function in the world as it is, not as I wish it to be. In the killings of Daunte Wright and George Floyd, both men resisted arrest. Both men died in the aftermath. I am not writing to debate what should or could have been. As one who seeks to prepare younger people for the longest and most productive life possible, I conclude that resisting arrest can escalate into a situation resulting in death. And death is final.<br />Gaetano LaRoche<br />Wright, Wyo.<br /><br />It seems highly unlikely that officer Kim Potter intentionally killed Wright. Obey-or-die policing is the issue. Policing methods too often result in escalation and death for minor offenses, prompting accusations of racism. During arrests, police appear to have no tolerance for panic, bad judgment, mental illness, drug-induced behavior or simple mistakes. When an unarmed arrestee panics and runs, he should be recaught, not shot. Noncompliance during an arrest for a minor offense should never escalate to death."
