    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. criticized China’s protection of intellectual property on Friday, saying that measures Beijing adopted—some to comply with the 2020 U.S.-China trade deal—don’t go far enough.<br />In an annual report on intellectual-property protections, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative acknowledged that China amended its patent, copyright and criminal laws in 2020. But the report said that “these steps toward reform require effective implementation and also fall short of the full range of fundamental changes needed to improve the IP landscape in China.”<br />The Biden administration’s approach to China is still officially under review, but officials have made clear that they intend to continue or step up many of the Trump administration’s critiques of the world’s second-largest economy.<br />The Chinese embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />The Chinese foreign ministry has said previously that the country is prioritizing and strengthening its policies around innovation and intellectual-property protection, and that China sees such protections as critical because of the importance of scientific advancement to its economy."
