    "body": "For more than 35 years, The Wall Street Journal’s Economic Forecasting Survey has helped readers better understand the direction of the U.S. economy by publishing consensus forecasts from a panel of academic, business and financial economists. On this page, you’ll find general information about the survey, details on how often and when we conduct it, plus links to stories and downloadable archival data in Excel spreadsheets.<br />The survey’s frequency has changed over time. As of April 2021, we conduct it quarterly—in January, April, July and October. From the mid-1980s through 2002, its frequency was twice a year. From 2003 through March 2021, we conducted it monthly.<br />We ask economists to forecast a range of economic indicators: quarterly and annual GDP, the Consumer Price Index, unemployment rate, monthly change in nonfarm payrolls, the midpoint of the range for the Federal Funds Rate, closing yield on 10-year Treasury Notes, and others. Some questions, such as GDP, have been asked throughout the life of the survey. Others, such as the exchange rate for Euros to U.S. dollars, were asked only for a time.<br />Each month, the survey includes questions related to current events. We also ask economists for comments for publication. Not every economist answers every question.<br />The panel includes more than 70 academic, business and financial economists, and the makeup of the panel has evolved over time. The name and affiliation of each economist, as well as their latest indicator forecasts, is included in the Excel spreadsheet available with each survey."
