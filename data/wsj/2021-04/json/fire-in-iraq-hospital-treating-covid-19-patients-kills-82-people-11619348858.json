    "body": "BAGHDAD—Exploding oxygen canisters sparked a fire that engulfed a Baghdad hospital treating Covid-19 patients, killing at least 82 people, Iraqi officials said on Sunday.<br />The fire began late Saturday night after oxygen canisters ignited in a hospital ward full of coronavirus patients being treated with ventilators, setting off a scramble to evacuate more than 200 people from the hospital, Iraqi health and civil defense officials said.<br />A spokesman for Iraq’s interior ministry said 82 people were killed and 110 people were injured in the fire.<br />In an emergency overnight meeting with senior government officials, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi called the fire a “painful incident” caused by negligence. He called for senior hospital and health ministry officials to be questioned by investigators, and ordered other facilities to be checked to prevent future disasters.<br />“Go and check every single wire in every office and hospital,” he said according to a statement from his office. He also declared three days of national mourning."
