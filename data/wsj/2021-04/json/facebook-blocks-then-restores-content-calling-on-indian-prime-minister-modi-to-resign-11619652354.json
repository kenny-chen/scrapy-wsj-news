    "body": "Facebook Inc.  temporarily blocked posts containing hashtags calling on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resign, then reinstated them on Wednesday, saying the action had been taken in error.<br />The #ResignModi hashtag was blocked on Facebook for several hours amid national controversy over India’s response to an escalating Covid-19 crisis and the government’s efforts to curb public dissent.<br />Facebook declined to say what led to the action, though it has previously apologized for other hashtag removals, which can be performed either by human review teams or the company’s automated enforcement tools.<br />“We temporarily blocked this hashtag by mistake, not because the Indian government asked us to, and have since restored it,” said Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman.<br />In recent months, Mr. Modi’s government has demanded that Facebook,  Twitter Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google remove content supporting farmer-led protests of an agricultural law or criticizing the government’s pandemic response."
