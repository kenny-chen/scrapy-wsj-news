    "body": "Signs are emerging of a shift under way in the oil market, with demand weakening in Asia and picking up in the West, just as supplies of Iranian crude oil have climbed.<br />That marks a reversal from 2020, when a bounceback in economic activity in China and India powered a recovery in crude prices after the blow dealt by Covid-19. Now, Chinese imports have slowed while a worsening epidemic in India threatens to hit demand in the worldâ€™s third-largest consumer of oil.<br />Demand in the U.S. and Europe, on the other hand, is expected to rally as vaccination efforts gather pace and restrictions on movement are eased.<br />At the same time, supplies of sour Middle Eastern crude oils favored by refiners in Asia are on the rise. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed to boost production to meet a pickup in global demand, while Iranian oil output has jumped since the fall.<br />These forces have combined to flip a key indicator of supply and demand in different regions by curtailing the price growth for sour Dubai crude, which is used as a reference for exports from the Middle East."
