    "body": "The worst crisis in aviation history isn’t over, but new airlines are already sizing up the post-pandemic market. While some may succeed, their aggression bodes better for travelers than investors.<br />Global airline capacity is still down 40% relative to January 2020 and travel restrictions aren’t coming down. Many carriers, such as  Avianca ,  Aeroméxico and  Norwegian Air Shuttle ,  remain in administration.<br />Yet startups are sprouting to take their place.<br />The latest big announcement came last month from the founder and former chief executive of Norwegian, Bjørn Kjos, who will once again attempt to bring low-cost flights to trans-Atlantic routes with a new venture, Norse Atlantic Airways. Similarly, Icelandic startup Play is stepping into the shoes of WOW air, which closed down in 2019 after attempting the unorthodox combination of low-cost routes and a hub-based network strategy.<br />Most startups will focus on shorter routes. Traditional hub-and-spoke networks have shrunk during the pandemic, and analysts believe they may permanently exclude many regional airports. India’s Flybig, Italy’s EGO Airways and Houston-based Avelo Airlines all plan to fill that gap."
