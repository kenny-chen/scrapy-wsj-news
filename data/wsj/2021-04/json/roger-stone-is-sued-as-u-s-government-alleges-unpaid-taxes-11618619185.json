It further alleges that Mr. Stone owes another $400,000 in taxes and penalties on his 2018 income taxes, which were filed separately from his spouse.<br />Mr. Stone didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />He was convicted in 2019 of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of a congressional proceeding before being pardoned by then-President Donald Trump in the waning days of his administration.<br />The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where Mr. Stone lives."
