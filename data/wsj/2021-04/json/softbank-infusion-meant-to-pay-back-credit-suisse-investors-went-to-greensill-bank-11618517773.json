    "body": "When  SoftBank Group Corp.  made a last ditch-infusion of $440 million into Greensill Capital last November, the money was earmarked to pay off investors in  Credit Suisse  Group AG investment funds, according to people familiar with the deal.<br />But the cash never made it to the Swiss bank. Greensill put the money into its own German banking unit instead, according to a report released Thursday from the bankruptcy administrators for Greensill’s Australian parent company and some of the people familiar with the deal.<br />That detour is complicating Credit Suisse’s efforts to recover money owed to investors after Greensill collapsed into bankruptcy last month, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Credit Suisse this week identified $2.3 billion in problematic loans in funds it ran with Greensill, including the $440 million loan.<br />The incident shows the challenge in unraveling Greensill’s complicated web of transactions and how Greensill moved funds around to plug holes in its operations, according to the people familiar with the matter."
