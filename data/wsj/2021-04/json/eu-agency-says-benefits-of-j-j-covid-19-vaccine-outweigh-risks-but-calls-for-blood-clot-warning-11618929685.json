    "body": "Europeâ€™s health agency said a warning should be added to the product information of the  Johnson & Johnson  Covid-19 vaccine that unusual blood clots are a very rare possible side effect, but said the benefits of taking the shot outweigh the risks, even as the number of clotting cases rose slightly.<br />In the U.S., the number of cases of blood-clot disorders linked to the vaccine has increased to nine, up from the six initially reported, according to a senior U.S. health official. The European Medicines Agency said on Tuesday that it had looked at data from the U.S. in making its assessment.<br />The nine U.S. cases, including one death, are being investigated, the official said. Use of the J&J vaccine has been temporarily suspended on the recommendation of the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />The instances of clots overall is still very small given that about seven million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the U.S.<br />Last week, U.S. health authorities recommended pausing the rollout out of the J&J vaccine. They had considered only issuing a warning, but decided a pause would help make doctors aware of how to treat the rare condition. J&J then followed with the decision to pre-emptively pause the rollout in Europe, which had just begun."
