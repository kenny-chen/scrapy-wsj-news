    "body": "Pfizer Inc.  says it has identified in Mexico and Poland the first confirmed instances of counterfeit versions of the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with  BioNTech SE ,  the latest attempt by criminals trying to exploit the world-wide vaccination campaign.<br />Vials seized by authorities in separate investigations were tested by the company and confirmed to contain bogus vaccine. The vials recovered in Mexico also had fraudulent labeling, while a substance inside vials in Poland was likely an anti-wrinkle treatment, Pfizer said.<br />About 80 people at a clinic in Mexico received a fake vaccine going for about $1,000 a dose, though they don’t appear to have been physically harmed. The vials, found in beach-style beer coolers, had different lot numbers than those sent to the state, and a wrong expiration date, said Dr. Manuel de la O, the health secretary of Nuevo León state.<br />Polish authorities said no one there had received the counterfeit vaccine, which was seized at a man’s apartment.<br />The findings are the latest in an effort between law enforcement and drugmakers such as Pfizer,  Moderna Inc.  and  Johnson & Johnson  to stem criminal activity related to the Covid-19 vaccines. The global rollout of shots has provided criminals a fresh opportunity to take advantage of unsuspecting people."
