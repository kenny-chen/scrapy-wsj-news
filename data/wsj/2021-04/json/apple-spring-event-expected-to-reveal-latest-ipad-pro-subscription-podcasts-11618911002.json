    "body": "Apple Inc.  on Tuesday is expected to reveal its annual update to high-end iPads, among other new products, and introduce a paid subscription option within its podcast app.<br />The spring event, to be held at 1 p.m. New York time via the company’s website, comes after Apple’s best fiscal year for iPads in six years fueled by students and workers stuck at home amid the global coronavirus pandemic.<br />The latest iPad Pro offerings will come with a comparably faster processor than last year’s version, and the addition of a mini-LED screen and optional 5G cellular connectivity, according to a person familiar with the plans. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company began offering the faster 5G technology in its newest iPhones last fall, helping juice sales for the device.<br />IPad sales rose 41% in the October-to-December quarter to $8.4 billion, and other Apple products such as its Mac computers, watches and wireless headphones also saw a significant uptick in sales because of the pandemic.<br />The company topped $100 billion in quarterly sales for the first time as consumers flocked to new iterations of the iPhone and other devices."
