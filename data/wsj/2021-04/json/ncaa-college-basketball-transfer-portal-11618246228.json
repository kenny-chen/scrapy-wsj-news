    "body": "Men’s college basketball weathered the cancellation of its marquee March Madness event in 2020 and a rocky pandemic season in 2021. Now this offseason will feature a new kind of turmoil: a huge wave of players who are rushing to change which team they play for.<br />Just one week after the season officially ended with Baylor cutting down the nets to win the national title, 1,296 players have indicated a desire to transfer by entering the NCAA’s “transfer portal,” a national database introduced in 2018 that lets players broadcast their intention to leave without first obtaining permission from their current school. That is more than double the 600 or so who switched schools via the transfer portal last season.<br />That means that more than 28% of the more than 4,500 Division I scholarship men’s basketball players could be on the move this offseason.<br />“It’s like a big game of musical chairs. And the interesting thing to me is going to be when the music stops,” said Tad Boyle, the coach at Colorado, where six of the 18 players have indicated they intend to transfer.<br />The huge uptick in players transferring comes as players are anticipating that the NCAA will soon change its rule that requires athletes in some sports, including basketball, to sit out a year if they choose to transfer. Some conferences have already enacted such rules."
