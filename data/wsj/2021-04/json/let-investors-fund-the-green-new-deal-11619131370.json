    "body": "The White House says it wants wealthy Americans to pay for its green energy experiments and many wealthy Americans are eager to do so. So why bother getting the IRS involved?<br />Allowing the climate-obsessed leaders of global financial institutions to hand over the money voluntarily is the intriguing idea floated on Thursday by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The former Federal Reserve chair still sees a need for taxpayer support, but extending her idea to 100% private funding would yield even better results.<br />Sarah Ewall-Wice of CBS News reports:<br />Why not all of it? Certainly the demand for funding among people pursuing environmental agendas is massive, but so too is the willingness of the managers of large financial institutions to allocate capital to such pursuits. It’s hard to find a major bank CEO, even a good one like  JPMorgan ’s  Jamie Dimon, who isn’t engaged in a significant effort to back allegedly green projects and limit funding to fossil fuels.<br />Large asset managers are just as trendy. The Journal’s Dawn Lim recently noted that  BlackRock  already manages around $200 billion via “sustainable” strategies and is aiming for $1 trillion by 2030. The firm has even arranged to pay more to its lenders if it fails to meet various “sustainability” goals."
