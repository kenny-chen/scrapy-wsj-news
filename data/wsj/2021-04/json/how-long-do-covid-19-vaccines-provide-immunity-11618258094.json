    "body": "How long does protection from Covid vaccines last? It’s a question that’s becoming more important as some of the first people to be vaccinated approach four months post-inoculation.<br />The short answer is: We don’t fully know yet. But more data is coming in that provides clues. Here’s what we know so far.<br />Recent data from  Pfizer ,  the manufacturer of one of the three vaccines available in the U.S., indicates that protection lasts at least six months. The results showed minimal antibody decline. Recipients of the Moderna vaccine also had robust levels of antibodies more than six months later, according to a recent study published in NEJM.<br />Some people have incorrectly concluded that means that those vaccines offer only six months of protection, says Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. “That’s false,” says Dr. Hensley. “We only have six months of data...Six months from now it’s likely we’ll learn we have one year of protection.”<br />The vaccines will likely provide at least some degree of protection for a long time because there are so many layers of immunity, says Deepta Bhattacharya, an associate professor of immunobiology at the University of Arizona in Tucson."
