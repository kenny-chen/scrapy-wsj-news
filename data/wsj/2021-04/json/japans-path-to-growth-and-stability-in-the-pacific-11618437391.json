    "body": "Japan faces a turning point. After the pandemic, our challenge will be to return to a growth trajectory and play a strong leadership role in the global economy.<br />An aging and declining population, a bureaucracy hamstrung by sectionalism and intransigent special interests—delivering solutions to these longstanding and difficult problems and implementing further growth-oriented reforms are at the core of my administration’s growth strategy.<br />Japan must take the lead in creating new drivers for growth, for both its own economy and the world’s. I see particular potential in green policies and digital transformation.<br />Climate change is a pressing global issue. I see addressing it not as an economic constraint but as a driving force to create strong, sustainable growth. With that conviction, I have committed to making Japan carbon-neutral by 2050.<br />Late last year my government unveiled a Green Growth Strategy featuring ambitious goals for offshore wind, hydrogen and other technologies. We will mobilize a range of policies to promote investment and innovation in the private economy, including a ¥2 trillion ($18 billion) fund to support green projects, tax incentives, regulatory reforms, international standardization programs and other forms of international cooperation."
