    "body": "Simon & Schuster Chief Executive Jonathan Karp said Tuesday the publisher would proceed with a book by former Vice President Mike Pence despite objections from some of its employees, saying he wants to preserve a culture that presents different perspectives.<br />The publisher responded to petitions being circulated by its employees internally and on social media. They demanded that the company cancel Mr. Pence’s book, refrain from signing deals with other Trump administration figures and cut off a distribution relationship with Post Hill Press, a publisher of conservative books.<br />It was unclear how many signatories the petitions had.<br />An online petition says Simon & Schuster “has chosen complicity in perpetuating white supremacy by publishing Mike Pence and continuing to distribute books for Post Hill Press.” The petition accused Mr. Pence of advocating for policies that were racist, sexist and discriminatory toward LGBTQ+ people, among other criticisms of his tenure as a public official. “This is not a difference of opinions; this is legitimizing bigotry,” the petition said.<br />A spokesman for Mr. Pence declined to comment."
