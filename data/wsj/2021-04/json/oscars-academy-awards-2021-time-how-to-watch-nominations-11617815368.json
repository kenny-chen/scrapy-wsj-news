    "body": "The 93rd Oscars ceremony will take place on Sunday evening, April 25, in Los Angeles. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science plans to honor filmmaking from the past year in an in-person—but safely distanced—event.<br />Producers of the ceremony initially hoped to have the honors handed out—and received—only in person. However, given Covid risks and the challenges of international travel, the Academy appears to be open to remote acceptance speeches by winners who can’t make it to Los Angeles.<br />Beneath, a list of nominees and everything else you need to know about the ceremony.<br /><br />The big Oscars awards ceremony is Sunday, April 25, 2021, at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The show itself will take place at Union Station Los Angeles—where nominees, presenters and guests will convene—and the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood—where performances will happen."
