    "body": "Regarding Mary Anastasia O’Grady’s “Alaska Tourism is Ailing but Not From Covid” (Americas, April 5): Never mind tourism and trade, let’s talk national defense. The Jones Act, enacted to encourage U.S. shipbuilding and strengthen our maritime industrial base, has done the opposite. Large, commercial vessel construction in the U.S. is nearly nonexistent. As a result of the evisceration of our maritime industrial base, it will cost the U.S. taxpayer at least three to five times what it will cost our global adversaries to build a military vessel. We can’t afford not to reform the Jones Act.<br />Scott Jason<br />Portland, Maine<br /><br />The enormity of the Jones Act was driven home in a conversation I had with a senior staffer at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017. The Corps had been tasked with restoring electricity on the island and had requested a Jones Act waiver to transport 10,000 treated utility poles on any available vessels. It was granted a waiver of only 10 days. The task proved impossible in that time frame, and Puerto Rico went without electrical power for far longer than necessary in much of the island. In rural areas, that resulted in medications spoiling without refrigeration and clean water not being available. How many lives were lost as a result of this decision? It is all very unfortunate."
