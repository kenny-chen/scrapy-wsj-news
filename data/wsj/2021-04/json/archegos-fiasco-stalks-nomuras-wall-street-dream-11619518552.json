    "body": "Nomura’s Wall Street dream remains elusive as ever. Less grandiose—but more profitable—ambitions close to home might be a better use of the company’s resources and expertise.<br />The collapse of family investment firm Archegos last month was the latest setback to the Japanese bank’s ambitions to be a global investment bank: On Tuesday it reported 245.7 billion yen, the equivalent of $2.3 billion, of losses arising from the transactions with a U.S. client for last quarter. Nomura acted as a prime broker, lending money to trading clients, for the fund run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang.<br />The amount was less than the $5.5 billion lost by  Credit Suisse ,  but significantly more than the losses booked by other U.S. banks such as  Goldman Sachs ,  which moved fast to sell assets tied to Archegos.<br />The losses aren’t going to sink Nomura—it has ample capital supported by its strong domestic business—but they bring into question the bank’s decades of efforts to transform itself into a bulge-bracket Wall Street firm.<br />The Archegos disaster is only the latest episode of Nomura’s troubled journey abroad. The company had written down all the goodwill from its two iconic overseas expansions: the 2007 purchase of institutional broker Instinet, and its 2008 acquisition of Lehman Brothers’ Asian and European operations after the U.S. bank’s collapse."
