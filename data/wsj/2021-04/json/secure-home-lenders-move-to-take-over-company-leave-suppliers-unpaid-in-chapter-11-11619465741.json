    "body": "Private-equity-owned Secure Home Holdings LLC filed for bankruptcy protection after its top-ranking lenders agreed to award themselves the home-security systems business, leaving unsecured creditors owed $110 million unpaid.<br />Chief Executive Amy Kothari said the company is current on its trade debt, payments to landlords and other critical suppliers, and expects the bankruptcy will have no material impact on vendors.<br />The terms are proposed in a “prepackaged” chapter 11 reorganization plan that Secure Home filed Monday, shortly after the Sunday bankruptcy filing. Ballots haven't been cast yet, but top lenders, led by affiliates of  Invesco Ltd. , have agreed to cancel part of their debt in exchange for ownership of Secure Home.<br />Bank lenders are owed, in the aggregate, about $197 million, a figure that includes unspecified fees and costs, according to court papers.<br />Funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management mostly own Secure Home, with Ironwood Capital and Alcentra Capital Corp. as minority stakeholders. Oaktree declined to comment. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP and Chipman Brown Cicero & Cole LLP are providing legal advice to Secure Home. M3 Advisory Partners LP is the financial adviser. The case, No. 21-10745, has been assigned to Judge Kate Stickles"
