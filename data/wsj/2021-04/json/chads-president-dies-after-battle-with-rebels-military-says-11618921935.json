    "body": "Idriss Déby, who ruled the oil-producing nation of Chad for three decades, died Tuesday after sustaining injuries in clashes between rebels and government troops, the country’s military announced.<br />In a statement read on state television, military spokesman Gen. Azem Bermandoa Agouma said Mr. Déby, 68 years old, was injured in a battle with rebels advancing on the capital from the country’s northern border with Libya.<br />The announcement of his death, which couldn’t immediately be verified independently, came a day after Mr. Déby, a key ally of Chad’s former colonial power France and the U.S. in the fight against Boko Haram militants, was declared the winner of a contested April 11 presidential election. According to the official results, he won 79% of the vote.<br />“The president of the republic, the head of state, the supreme leader of the armed forces, Idriss Déby Itno, has just taken his final breath while defending the territorial integrity on the battlefield,” Gen. Bermandoa said.<br />Over the weekend, the U.S. State Department ordered all nonessential staff of its embassy in Chad to leave the country, citing the advancement of rebels from the north toward the capital, N’Djamena."
