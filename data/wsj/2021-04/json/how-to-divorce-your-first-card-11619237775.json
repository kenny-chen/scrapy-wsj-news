The average age of an open credit card account is eight to nine years, according to  Experian ,  a credit-reporting company.<br />As people age they tend to hold on to cards despite their high fees or lack of valuable rewards. Millennials between ages 24 and 39 have about three credit cards on average, whereas baby boomers have an average of four to five, according to 2020 data from Experian.<br />Some people may be considering letting go of a card after paying down their card debt during the pandemic or realizing that the rewards of a certain card are no longer useful.
