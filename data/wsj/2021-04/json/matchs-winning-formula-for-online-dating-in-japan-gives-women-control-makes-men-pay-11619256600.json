It is aimed at singles serious about matrimony and tries to make women comfortable about signing up. Men have to pay and show their full real names if they want to start chatting. Women get in free and can use initials. They also choose the places to meet.<br />“A lot of women in Japan are afraid that it will be just for hookups, and they don’t want to get into hookups,” said Junya Ishibashi, chief executive of Pairs.<br />Despite the challenge of navigating cultural differences world-wide, the dating business is beginning to resemble fast food and casual clothing in that a few global companies are popular in many countries."
