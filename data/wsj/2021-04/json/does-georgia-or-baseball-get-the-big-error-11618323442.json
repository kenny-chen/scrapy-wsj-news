    "body": "Fay Vincent, the former Major League Baseball commissioner, is way off base with his statement that “the only people hurt by Mr. [Robert] Manfred’s decision”—moving this year’s All-Star game out of Atlanta—“will be Atlanta’s stadium workers and local vendors” (“Rob Manfred’s All-Star Error,” op-ed, April 7). Mr. Vincent’s loser lineup should also include taxi drivers, hoteliers, restaurateurs, the myriad hospitality workers and the ordinary Atlantans who are in sore need of the taxes that would be collected as a result of the tourism the All-Star game generates. Mostly, though, the game of baseball will suffer immensely from the turnoff of fans to this overtly political decision. Time for an instant replay of this bad move.<br />Alan Bergstein<br />Boca Raton, Fla.<br /><br />For those who object to the response of MLB and certain corporations over the recently passed Georgia voting law, may I offer an alternative? Support Georgia. Put your time and treasure to work to support the citizens of this fine state. Visit Atlanta, a major metropolitan mecca. Visit Savannah, a jewel of the South. Explore the many natural beauties of the state that repose in its parks, beaches and mountains. Meet and get to know the people of Georgia and embrace the warmth and hospitality that they offer. And in so doing, let us remember as a nation that a house divided against itself cannot stand."
