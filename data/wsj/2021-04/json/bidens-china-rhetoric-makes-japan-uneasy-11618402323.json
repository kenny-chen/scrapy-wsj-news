    "body": "TOKYO—Asked about China at his first press conference last month, President Biden forecast stiff competition and said the U.S. would be unrelenting in telling the world about Beijing’s human-rights abuses.<br />A week before that, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was asked a similar question at a press conference of his own. He said Tokyo and Beijing have various issues between them, and left it there.<br />Hesitancy among allies to tackle China head-on is a challenge for Mr. Biden’s foreign policy, which stresses working with them to amplify America’s global power.<br />This Friday, Mr. Suga will become the first foreign leader to meet Mr. Biden in person, a distinction Japan has trumpeted. Yet political and business leaders in Tokyo are uneasy at being enlisted in public confrontation with China, holding out hope for a modus operandi that would restrain Beijing’s military but keep lucrative trade more or less untouched.<br />“Japan is making efforts to ensure the security distrust does not affect economic ties,” said Rumi Aoyama, a professor at Waseda University."
