    "body": "In his “Yes, Boycott Baseball” (Wonder Land, April 8), Daniel Henninger states: “Liberals have given in completely to the narcotic pleasure of total guilt.” I totally agree with “narcotic” and pleasure” but disagree with “guilt,” as explaining the woke phenomenon guilt is a painful act of self-incrimination. But this isn’t the feeling expressed by St. Augustine, who, looking at his past, couldn’t get over his youthful transgressions. The better reference to modern wokism is Augustine’s “City of God,” whose invisible citizens are divided into those who are and those who are not going to be saved, and whose diverging identities only God knows. But in the modern version, wokes already know they are going to heaven and are looking down on the rest of us, who are not so regretfully slated for the other place. In their minds, their easily acquired enlightenment has already saved them. Hence, if you noticed, their mea culpa isn’t beating their breasts but beating ours for us. They are not scourging themselves, but triumphantly administrating the whip to the backs of us sinners. No, this isn’t guilt. It is pride. Which, if we are to follow the religious analogies, comes before the fall.<br />Jack Kaczorowski<br />Los Angeles, Calif."
