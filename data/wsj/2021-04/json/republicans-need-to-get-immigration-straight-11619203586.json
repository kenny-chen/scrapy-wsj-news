    "body": "Extolling the virtues of the country’s immigrants, and stressing the oft-ignored difference between legal and illegal immigration, Peggy Noonan makes a good case for Republicans to embrace immigrants with “sympathy and respect” (“Republicans and Immigrants Need Each Other,” Declarations, April 17). To put a finer point on her electoral math: There are far more immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants than there are woke corporate executives who hire them as cheap labor. If Republican can count, they would be wise to focus more on courting the former as voters than the latter as donors.<br />Gregory Marshall<br />Marietta, Ga.<br /><br />In an essay otherwise supportive of immigration, Ms. Noonan writes that illegal immigration “takes jobs” and “depresses wages.” By this logic, growing female participation in the workforce also pushes down pay. Computers, WiFi and other technology should be rethought in consideration of all the labor they displace."
