    "body": "MOSCOW—Jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny was hospitalized Monday, weeks after beginning a hunger strike, as the Kremlin brushed off warnings from the U.S. of repercussions if the activist were to die while in prison.<br />His hospitalization came a day after his supporters called for large-scale demonstrations to demand his release after doctors with ties to the opposition leader cited medical test results they said showed he was at risk of imminent renal failure and a possible heart attack.<br />Mr. Navalny, a prominent Putin critic who is serving a 2½-year prison sentence after being convicted of violating parole conditions, was transferred to a hospital for convicts within the prison system in Russia’s Vladimir region, where he would remain under observation, prison authorities said Monday.<br />His health condition had been “assessed as satisfactory” and a doctor has been examining him every day, they said. The activist had also consented to being prescribed “vitamin therapy,” they added, without detailing the nature of such treatment.<br />Mr. Navalny has been on hunger strike for about three weeks over what he has called poor treatment since he was incarcerated in February. He has accused authorities of lack of medical attention for what he described as debilitating back pain and numbness in his legs and one hand."
