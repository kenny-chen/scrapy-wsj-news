    "body": "Regarding the letter by Dennis Slater, president of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (“The ‘Right to Repair’ Is a Complicated Issue,” April 6): I just had my five-year-old refrigerator door fixed by a knowledgeable repairman and saved another refrigerator from the landfill. How? A small part, a vertical hinge, was available from the manufacturer. I wasn’t so lucky when my two-year-old printer’s screen froze. After multiple failed attempts to restore or reboot the printer with a tech expert, I sent it back to the insurance company as instructed.<br />There is no one local who can fix the printer because there are no parts available from the manufacturer to replace the defective one. I’m not OK with that. The right-to-repair policy idea is spreading and it is necessary for consumers. It will also support our small businesses and provide skilled jobs locally while reducing the amount of electronics that prematurely become landfill fodder.<br />Joan Flaherty<br />Rehoboth Beach, Del."
