    "body": "Bureaucratic hypercaution and delay bungled Europe’s early Covid-19 vaccine rollout. But while European regulators seem to be learning from their mistakes, the Biden Administration looks to be repeating them.<br />Six cases of severe brain blood clots known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine recipients prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration last week to recommend shots be paused. Similar strokes had been linked with  AstraZeneca ’s  vaccine, which uses similar technology.<br />The agencies said the pause was necessary to notify health-care providers how to treat the unusual clots and give regulators time to review cases. Fair enough. FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said the pause would only be days, and the White House assured the public it wouldn't frustrate vaccinations. That’s not what happened.<br />The CDC convened a meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—the same group that set vaccine group priorities—last Wednesday to review incidents and assess their significance. But this isn’t the CDC’s bailiwick, as Journal contributor Scott Gottlieb pointed out in these pages on Monday.<br />The FDA collects safety information after vaccine approval and makes decisions about balancing risks and benefits of medical products. It’s not clear why FDA officials were sidelined or why the CDC punted to a panel of outside experts, but Dr. Woodcock and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky may have been looking for political cover."
