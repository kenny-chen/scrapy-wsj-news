    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden and Republicans are competing to update the nation’s infrastructure—or, rather, the definition of what constitutes infrastructure in the 21st century.<br />Who prevails could gain a political edge in the debate over the Biden administration’s $2.3-trillion plan to address a post-pandemic world and give American workers and companies the tools they need to compete with China.<br />The title of the bill—the American Jobs Plan—doesn’t provide much of a blueprint: a reference to the construction and other jobs the administration predicts will be created as a result.<br />In remarks Wednesday from the White House, President Biden said infrastructure should be viewed as an evolving term. If it meant building the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s and winning the Space Race in the 1960s, then it should mean providing rural broadband and job training and refurbishing Veterans Affairs medical centers in the 2020s.<br />Republicans have hammered that approach, painting the administration’s definition as a facade for a long liberal wish list of green technology proposals, healthcare initiatives and tax increases for corporations and the wealthy."
