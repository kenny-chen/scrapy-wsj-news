    "body": "Florida’s Republican-controlled legislature advanced a measure that would tighten vote-by-mail rules, marking the latest state-level push to change election rules after voters flocked to remote voting during the pandemic.<br />With two days left in the legislative session, Florida’s House approved an election-law bill Wednesday over Democrat opposition. The House amended a bill already approved by the Senate, and the new version will head back to the Senate for review.<br />Democrats are broadly against the proposals, which include new rules concerning ballot drop boxes. Democrats say the bill will create unnecessary hurdles for minority voters in particular and say Republicans are trying to suppress votes after an election that ran smoothly in the state.<br />“This bill does not create guardrails, it creates barriers to voting,” State Rep. Robin Bartleman, a Democrat, said during a House debate before the bill passed.<br />Republicans say they aim to maintain access to the polls while also boosting election security."
