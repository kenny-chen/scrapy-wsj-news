    "body": "Lawmakers across several states are seeking to limit the powers of governors and other officials who, in the future, may want or need to implement public-health measures such as mask mandates.<br />In North Dakota, the House of Representatives pushed forward a bill that sought to ban mask mandates issued by state-elected officials or the state’s top health officer. The bill still allowed cities, counties, school districts and businesses to make rules for the usage of facial coverings.<br />On Wednesday, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum vetoed the bill, saying in a letter to the speaker of North Dakota’s House of Representatives, that the bill removes “a tool from the emergency tool kit that may be needed to help our state save lives and nimbly navigate future pandemics and their unknowable challenges.”<br />A day later, North Dakota House lawmakers overrode the governor’s veto, sending the bill to the state Senate, where it has been introduced.<br />Across the country, state lawmakers have sought to limit emergency powers given to governors during the pandemic, roll back mask mandates and, now, limit powers in a future public-health crisis."
