    "body": "Beef is off the menu at Condé Nast. The editors of its food publication Epicurious announced Monday they would no longer publish recipes, articles, social media, or newsletters featuring beef.<br />Is this about health? Nope. Losing weight? Nah. Epicurious’s bovine boycott is about saving the planet, of course.<br />Senior editor Maggie Hoffman and former digital director David Tamarkin say livestock contribute nearly 15% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, with gassy cattle accounting for 61% of that figure. Epicurious plans to replace fauna with flora in recipes.<br />“We know that some people might assume that this decision signals some sort of vendetta against cows—or the people who eat them,” Mr. Tamarkin and Ms. Hoffman wrote, but “our shift is solely about sustainability, about not giving airtime to one of the world’s worst climate offenders. We think of this decision as not anti-beef but rather pro-planet.”<br />Virtue signaling over red meat won’t make a difference on climate change. The editors concede as much, writing that “individual actions like choosing alt-meat—or mushrooms, or chickpeas—instead of the real thing can feel so small they’re essentially pointless.”"
