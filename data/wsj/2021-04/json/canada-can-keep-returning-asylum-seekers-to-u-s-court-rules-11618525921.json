    "body": "A Canadian court ruled that asylum seekers arriving in Canada at official border crossings can be turned back to the U.S., reversing an earlier decision that found the practice to be in violation of Canadian law.<br />Thursday’s ruling has broad implications for both the U.S. and Canada in how officials will handle those who approach the Canadian border through the U.S. and are from third countries, such as the wave of asylum seekers from Haiti and Nigeria that entered Canada over land in 2017 and 2018. Under a 2020 ruling, which had not yet come into effect, Canada would have been obligated to let those individuals enter at official border crossings, where they would have had an opportunity to file their asylum claims in Canada.<br />The latest decision means Canada can continue to return asylum seekers to the U.S.<br />The appeals court said last year’s decision was flawed because there wasn’t enough evidence in a case that had constitutional repercussions. The lower court, it said, leaned too heavily on anecdotes, select evidence and media reports.<br />Human rights and refugee groups had argued Canada was violating asylum seekers’ rights by returning them to the U.S., where they faced imprisonment and the possibility of being deported to their home country—an action that might put their safety at risk."
