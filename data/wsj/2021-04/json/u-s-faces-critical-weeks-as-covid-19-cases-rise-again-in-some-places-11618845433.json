    "body": "Although half of all U.S. adults have had at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a constellation of factors are complicating the country’s fight against the virus.<br />States are scrambling to reorganize vaccination efforts after pausing use of the  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine while U.S. health officials investigate rare but severe cases of blood clots.<br />The seven-day average number of new Covid-19 infections eclipses the 14-day average in about half the country, with 40 states hitting that benchmark last Wednesday.<br />And the age distribution of Covid-19 cases showing up in hospitals has shifted to a younger population, as younger people, who haven’t been vaccinated, are helping drive a rise in cases, according to health officials.<br />The CDC reported Monday that the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases is at more than 67,443, up 1% from the prior seven-day average of 66,702. Four weeks ago, the seven-day average was 53,000 cases a day, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, during a press briefing Monday."
