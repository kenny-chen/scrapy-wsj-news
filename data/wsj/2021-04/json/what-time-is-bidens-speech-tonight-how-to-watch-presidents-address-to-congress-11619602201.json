    "body": "President Biden’s first address to a joint session of Congress will look different from past presidents’ because of the coronavirus pandemic. The speech will give him a chance to discuss his first 100 days and his legislative agenda before a prime-time audience.<br />Mr. Biden’s speech to Congress is expected to begin around 9 p.m. ET Wednesday.<br />You can watch Mr. Biden’s speech and the Republican response on WSJ.com starting around 9 p.m. ET. We will also have live video coverage of the event on our WSJ apps and our YouTube channel. And most networks, C-Span and the White House’s social media channels will carry the speech live.<br />No. Recent presidents have delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress early in their first year, followed by State of the Union addresses in subsequent years.<br />This year, about 200 people will be in the chamber for the speech because of the pandemic, a fraction of the roughly 1,600 people who typically attend such addresses. Members of Congress are expected to be socially distanced in seats on the House floor and in the upstairs gallery. First lady Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, also will be in the chamber but they aren’t expected to be accompanied by guests. There won’t be a first lady’s box as there has been for past presidential addresses to Congress. Chief Justice John Roberts will be the lone representative of the Supreme Court and two members of Mr. Biden’s cabinet—Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin—will attend. Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will represent the nation’s military."
