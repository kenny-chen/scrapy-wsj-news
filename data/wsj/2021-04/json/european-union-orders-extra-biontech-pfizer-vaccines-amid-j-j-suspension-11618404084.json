    "body": "The European Union, grappling with the potential loss of  Johnson & Johnson  Covid-19 vaccines, will buy an additional 50 million doses from BioNTech and  Pfizer Inc.  for the quarter, and is in talks to purchase up to 1.8 billion more doses over the next two years.<br />European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the new order would bring total deliveries of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine for the quarter to 250 million doses. The EU also expects 35 million doses from  Moderna Inc.  and 70 million doses from  AstraZeneca  PLC during that period.<br />J&J had been expected to deliver 55 million doses during the quarter, but that is now in question after the company said this week it would delay the rollout of its vaccine in Europe due to concerns about possible links to rare blood clots.<br />J&J’s vaccine requires only one shot, compared with two shots for all the others, so its deliveries had represented an even larger proportion of total effective vaccinations. Before Wednesday’s announcement of new BioNTech-Pfizer deliveries, the J&J shots had accounted for between 15% and 25% of current-quarter vaccinations.<br />Write to Daniel Michaels at daniel.michaels@wsj.com"
