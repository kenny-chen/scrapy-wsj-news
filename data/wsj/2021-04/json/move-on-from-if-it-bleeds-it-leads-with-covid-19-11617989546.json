    "body": "Regarding Nicole Saphier’s “Dr. Fauci, Tear Off These Masks” (op-ed, April 3): The media’s new favorite Covid story in the interest of keeping the drama alive is “breakthrough cases,” those fully vaccinated who have contracted Covid. Never mind that the hundred cases reported in Washington state are one-hundredth of 1% of the total 1.2 million who have been vaccinated there and that, given the vaccine is 95%, not 100% effective, this is to be expected. Only eight of the hundred were hospitalized and only two died, both over 80 and already ill.<br />What is the reason that health officials and much of the media insist on denying us even the faintest glimmer of hope? No one is suggesting we should be complacent. We are continuing to wear masks and keep our distance but now that 100 million of us, largely those at greatest risk of dying of Covid, are protected, might not cheerleading be a more effective approach than continued scare tactics and scolding?<br />Margaret McGirr<br />Greenwich, Conn."
