    "body": "TEL AVIV—Militants in Gaza fired more than 30 rockets into Israel overnight, the worst flareup in months amid escalating nightly clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in Jerusalem.<br />In response to the barrage, Israel struck Hamas military targets, including infrastructure and rocket launchers, Israel’s military said Saturday.<br />Two militant groups in Gaza, Fatah’s Al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine’s Abu Ali Brigades, claimed responsibility for the rocket fire. Israel says it holds Gaza ruler Hamas responsible for any violence coming from the Gaza Strip.<br />In a statement, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said Israel’s bombing of Hamas targets in Gaza as well as the recent clashes in Jerusalem are “part of its comprehensive aggressive policies against our people.” Hamas did claim the rocket fire but said “what the Palestinian resistance is doing in response to this aggression is within the framework of carrying out its national duty to protect and defend the interests of our people.”<br />No casualties were reported in either Israel or Gaza."
