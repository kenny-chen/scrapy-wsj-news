    "body": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is serving a 2½-year prison sentence after being convicted of violating the terms of his parole, including when he was recuperating in Germany after a near-fatal poisoning attempt last year.<br />Mr. Navalny, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin who has a significant reach on social media in Russia, said the threat of jail time was made to deter him from returning to Moscow in January.<br />His imprisonment effectively sidelined him from protests against the rule of Mr. Putin.<br />Recently, he has complained of poor treatment in prison and began a hunger strike to protest it and his health started to deteriorate, prompting fears among his supporters that he might die.<br />Alexei Navalny is Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, a fierce anticorruption activist who has managed to galvanize Russia’s political opposition by exposing flaws in the more than 20-year rule of Mr. Putin."
