    "body": "About three-quarters of U.S. workers and retirees believe they will have enough money for retirement, an increase from a year ago, according to a survey released Thursday.<br />The survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute provides a snapshot of how Americans feel about their retirement prospects.<br />Among workers, 72% are somewhat or very confident in their ability to live comfortably in retirement, up from 63% last March and 69% in January 2020. Today’s level is close to the survey’s record of 74% in 1993, three years after the survey began.<br />Craig Copeland, a senior research associate at EBRI, said that while people faced considerable uncertainty last March, many have a lot to be optimistic about now, including the growing availability of vaccines, the improving job market and the rising stock market.<br />Among retirees, 80% are optimistic about their financial prospects during retirement, up from 76% last March. The 82% registered in 2019 is the survey’s highest."
