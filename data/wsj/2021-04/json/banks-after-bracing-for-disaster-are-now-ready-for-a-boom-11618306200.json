    "body": "The accelerating economic recovery is likely to boost bank profits.<br />Encouraged by government efforts to pump money into the economy and signs that Americans are spending more, the largest financial institutions are expected to release some of the rainy-day money they set aside after the coronavirus pandemic hit. That will offer a jolt to their income in the first three months of the year.<br />JPMorgan Chase  & Co.,  Wells Fargo  & Co. and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  will disclose financial results on Wednesday.  Bank of America Corp.  and  Citigroup Inc.  report Thursday and  Morgan Stanley  follows on Friday. Analysts forecast that all of them will post first-quarter profits that are far above year-earlier levels.<br />Already, investor expectations are high. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which tracks shares of the largest lenders, is up 27% so far this year, nearly triple the gains of the S&P 500.<br />Banks are seen as proxies for the health of the U.S. economy. Their shares were in the doldrums around this time last year, when global commerce ground to a halt. But over the past few months, the stocks have bounced back. The index returned to a record in March, topping its prior high from 2007."
