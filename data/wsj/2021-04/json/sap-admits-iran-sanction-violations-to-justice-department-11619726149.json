    "body": "WASHINGTON—Software company  SAP SE  admitted it provided millions of dollars in software to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions, becoming the first company to benefit from a Justice Department program that encourages companies to self-report criminal export violations in exchange for leniency, U.S. authorities said Thursday.<br />Between 2010 and 2017, the German enterprise-software giant sent upgrades and software patches more than 20,000 times to users in Iran, and allowed its cloud businesses to give 2,360 Iranian users access to U.S.-based cloud services, the Justice Department said.<br />Some senior SAP executives were aware that the company wasn’t using filters to identify and block Iranian downloads, the agency said.<br />The company reported the issues to both regulators and criminal investigators, and cooperated in the government’s investigation, authorities said. SAP agreed to pay $8 million in penalties and enter an agreement under which prosecutors won’t prosecute the company in exchange for its improving compliance.<br />In a statement, SAP said it accepted “full responsibility for past conduct” and had enhanced its internal controls."
