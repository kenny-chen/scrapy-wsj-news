    "body": "TAIPEI—The derailment of a passenger train in Taiwan killed at least 50 people and injured more than 180 others on Friday in the island’s deadliest rail incident in at least four decades.<br />The express train, traveling from the Taipei area and heading southbound through eastern Taiwan to Taitung, was carrying almost 500 people, including railway staff, when it went off the tracks at around 9:30 a.m. in a tunnel near the scenic area of Hualien, causing some carriages to hit the tunnel walls, local authorities said. The train, the Taroko Express, is capable of reaching speeds of about 80 miles an hour.<br />As of 6 p.m. Saturday, 51 people, including two train conductors, two Americans and a French passenger, had been declared dead in the incident, while 188 injured had been taken to hospitals, according to authorities. By Friday evening, firefighters had rescued all remaining passengers.<br />“I share sorrow with my fellow countrymen,” Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said Friday afternoon. She said the Taiwan Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the incident, and urged the public to refrain from excessive speculation and await the final investigation results.<br />A preliminary investigation published by Taiwan’s Central Emergency Operation Center on Friday indicated that the eight-car train hit a construction vehicle that had stopped on the tracks."
