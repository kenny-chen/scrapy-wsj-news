    "body": "A New York court on Tuesday barred former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman from practicing law for a year, saying his admitted abuse of girlfriends was professional misconduct.<br />Mr. Schneiderman, 66 years old, served as New Yorkâ€™s top law enforcement officer from 2011 through May of 2018, when he abruptly resigned following the publication of a New Yorker magazine article in which several women alleged he physically abused them.<br />In court records connected with his law-license suspension, Mr. Schneiderman admitted emotionally and verbally abusing women with whom he was romantically involved and engaging in professional misconduct. He also admitted slapping prior girlfriends, placing his hands on their neck and applying pressure without their consent.<br />The sanction against Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, comes as a result of disciplinary proceedings initiated by an attorney-grievance committee of the New York state appellate division after members reviewed allegations in the New Yorker report. The disciplinary committee filed eight charges against Mr. Schneiderman in August 2020, claiming the abuse violated the New York Rules of Professional Conduct.<br />On Tuesday, Mr. Schneiderman agreed to the one-year suspension of his law license and continued treatment with a mental-health professional, according to an opinion issued by an intermediate appeals court in Manhattan. The New York City Bar Lawyer Assistance Program will supervise him, the opinion said."
