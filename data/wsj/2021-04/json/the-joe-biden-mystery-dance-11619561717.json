    "body": "The U.S. liberation of Europe was a shambolic enterprise as all gargantuan novel efforts tend to be: “Swimming” tanks carried their crews straight to the bottom on D-Day; Eisenhower was at wit’s end over Allied bombing of friendly troops; in the war’s last months, the U.S. contended not just with the enemy but thousands of U.S. deserters engaged in pilfering and reselling American supplies.<br />The liberation was nonetheless successful because of a broad commitment in the American electorate and society to getting it done.<br />Eisenhower later as president would limit himself to realistic aims: an interstate highway system, the U2 program that allowed the U.S. to measure Soviet ICBM capabilities against the hysterical claims of Khrushchev and the Democrats.<br />Which brings us to Joe Biden. He speaks as if he has a mandate to do heroic things regardless of cost; hard to pick up amid the verbal grandiosity are the one or two realistic ones he perhaps hopes to accomplish. He might get a union-built electric-vehicle charging network, but the alleged problem of climate change would remain as unaffected as ever.<br />To govern is to choose, notes the journal Foreign Affairs, but “the administration of President Joe Biden often seems to believe that to govern . . . is to choose nearly everything.”"
