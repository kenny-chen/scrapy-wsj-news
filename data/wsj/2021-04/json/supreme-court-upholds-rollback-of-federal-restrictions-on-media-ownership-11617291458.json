    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court unanimously upheld a regulatory rollback of federal limits on media ownership in local markets, a decision that could open the door to further industry consolidation.<br />The court, in an opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, ruled Thursday that the Federal Communications Commission acted reasonably in 2017 when it loosened three longstanding media-ownership restrictions.<br />The FCC’s action came when the commission was under Republican control, led by then-Chairman Ajit Pai. Citing dramatic changes to the media landscape, the commission, split along partisan lines, made it easier for one entity to own multiple TV stations in the same market. It also removed prohibitions on common ownership of both a TV station and a newspaper in the same market, or a TV station and a radio station.<br />Some ownership limits had been in place for decades, to prevent concentration and preserve viewpoint diversity in local markets.<br />The rollback came after the commission concluded in 2016 that the rules were still needed. The FCC, across administrations, had been tied up in court on the media rules for nearly 20 years."
