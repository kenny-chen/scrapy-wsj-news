    "body": "As China’s Communist Party revs up its 100th-birthday plans, it is celebrating a new addition to its list of accomplishments: the production of a genuinely popular patriotic TV drama.<br />“Minning Town,” a 23-episode series about the party’s poverty-alleviation efforts, scored a 9.4 out of 10 on Chinese review site Douban.com when it aired earlier this year—besting the likes of  Netflix ’s  “The Queen’s Gambit.” An international version is in the works, but the English-subtitled original is already available on YouTube, where it has accumulated millions of views.<br />Chinese propaganda officials are now dissecting the show to figure out how to replicate its success.<br />For all its hard propaganda work, the post-Mao Communist Party has struggled to win eyeballs away from commercial TV and film, whether domestic or foreign. Even with the power to compel the country’s top directors and biggest stars to participate, officials have had to juice box-office numbers for films about party history by requiring state-owned companies to buy tickets for their employees.<br />That frustrates Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has repeatedly exhorted his propaganda officials to “tell China’s story well.” In a speech published last month by the party’s main theoretical journal, Mr. Xi said it was imperative to “encourage the creation of artistic content about party history, especially film and TV.”"
