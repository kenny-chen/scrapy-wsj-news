    "body": "The Oscars may suffer from declining viewership and a down year for movie releases limited by the pandemic. But the organization that runs Hollywood’s most prestigious awards ceremony is on solid financial ground, with a growing collection of assets approaching $1 billion, according to the academy and its affiliates’ consolidated financial statements.<br />Most people know the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) for staging the Oscars. Thanks to some savvy investing and consistent annual revenue, the academy is also a wealthy nonprofit with influence extending far beyond one red-carpet event.<br />Sagging ratings haven’t hurt the revenues Ampas generates through its lucrative U.S. and international TV deals. The Oscars airs in more than 200 countries.<br />As the 93rd edition of the show takes place Sunday at 8 p.m. ET, here’s a look at some key numbers behind this organization:<br />Ampas’s annual awards revenues reached $131.9 million in 2020, capping a decade of robust growth anchored by its huge TV deals. The academy’s assets grew by more than $30 million last year. It posted $82.7 million in revenues in 2010."
