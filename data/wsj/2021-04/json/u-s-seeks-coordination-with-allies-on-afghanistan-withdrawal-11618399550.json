    "body": "BRUSSELS—Top U.S. officials ramped up coordination with allies on Wednesday as President Biden prepared to announce a withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.<br />“Together we have achieved the goals that we set out to achieve, and now it is time to bring our forces home,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters before meeting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.<br />Mr. Stoltenberg said he welcomed the “opportunity to closely coordinate and consult with all allies, as we agree on our future presence in Afghanistan.”<br />U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other leading NATO diplomats and military officials and officers are set to join Messrs. Blinken and Stoltenberg in an effort to draw down forces before Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.<br />Mr. Biden is expected to announce the decision formally on Wednesday, marking the second time in less than two years that an American president has set a date to end the nation’s involvement in the Afghan conflict—the longest war in U.S. history. Last year, then-President Donald Trump reached a deal with the insurgent Taliban movement under which U.S. troops would depart by May 1."
