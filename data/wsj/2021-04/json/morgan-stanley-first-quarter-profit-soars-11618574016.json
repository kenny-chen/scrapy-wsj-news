    "body": "Morgan Stanley  lost $911 million when Archegos Capital Management imploded last month, tarnishing a record-setting quarter for the Wall Street firm.<br />The New York-based bank on Friday reported quarterly profit of $4.1 billion, or $2.19 a share, on revenue of $15.7 billion. That beat the consensus estimates of analysts polled by FactSet of per-share earnings of $1.72 on revenue of $14.1 billion.<br />Morgan Stanley reaped big gains from the euphoric market conditions of early 2021. But record performance across many of the bank’s businesses was offset by credit and trading losses it booked following a fire sale of stocks tied to Archegos, the family office run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang.<br />Still, Morgan Stanley rounded out an all-time great first quarter from the nation’s big banks. Asset prices rallied, millions of investors traded stocks with abandon and scores of technology and special-purpose acquisition companies listed their shares publicly, creating an optimal environment for banks’ Wall Street divisions. On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley rival  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  reported record quarterly revenue and net income.<br />The same waves that lifted Goldman also lifted Morgan Stanley. Stock- and bond-trading revenue rose 29% to $5.8 billion. Fees from advising on deals and underwriting stock and bond offerings more than doubled to $2.6 billion."
