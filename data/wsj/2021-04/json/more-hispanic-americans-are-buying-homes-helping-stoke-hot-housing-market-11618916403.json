    "body": "Hispanic homeownership grew at a record pace last year, fueled by younger buyers who have helped make this demographic a growing force in the red-hot U.S. housing market.<br />The number of Hispanic-homeowner households rose by more than 700,000 to nearly 9 million in 2020, according to Census Bureau data compiled by the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, an industry group. Those gains marked the biggest one-year increase in data on Hispanic homeownership going back two decades, NAHREP said.<br />Hispanic buyers have been a consistent source of strength in the housing market in recent years. Their buying power continues to grow as individuals enter their early 30s, the most typical years for first-time home buyers. Hispanics in the U.S. had a median age of 30 in 2019, which was about 14 years younger than the median age for non-Hispanic white Americans.<br />Heidy and Jonathan De La Cruz purchased a newly built home in Deltona, Fla., this spring. “It really, really feels surreal,” said Ms. De La Cruz, who is 28 years old. She said they decided to buy a home after speaking with a friend who works in real estate about the importance of homeownership.<br />“I know more about buying a house than my parents would, and then my daughter will know more than me,” she said."
