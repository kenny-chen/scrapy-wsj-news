    "body": "Kimco Realty Corp.  has agreed to acquire fellow grocery-anchored shopping-center owner  Weingarten Realty Investors  for nearly $3.9 billion in cash and stock as it looks to expand its presence in the rapidly growing Sunbelt region.<br />Kimco on Thursday said it plans to pay $2.89 in cash and issue 1.408 shares for each Weingarten share.<br />Based on Kimcoâ€™s Wednesday closing price of $19.48, the deal values Houston-based Weingarten at $30.32 a share, an 11% premium to its Wednesday closing price of $27.34.<br />The deal gives Kimco more opportunity to increase leasing and slightly lowers its balance sheet debt, which is typically rare for mergers, said Conor Flynn, chief executive of Kimco.<br />Kimco, based in Jericho, N.Y., said its shareholders will own roughly 71% of the combined company upon closing of the deal, slated for the second half of the year, while Weingarten shareholders will own about 29%."
