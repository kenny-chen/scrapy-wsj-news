    "body": "The Daily Mail’s owner filed an antitrust suit against  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google on Tuesday, alleging the tech giant manipulates search results and advertising auctions in ways that harm online publishers.<br />The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court, alleges that Google punishes publishers in search rankings if they don’t sell enough advertising space through Google’s marketplace.<br />The Daily Mail’s concerns stem in part from its assessment that its coverage of the U.K.’s royal family in 2021 has been played down in Google’s search results, a spokesman for the publisher said.<br />A Google spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />Publishing executives complain in private about Google’s dominance of search and advertising, but few go public with their grievances. In January, the parent company of West Virginia’s Charleston Gazette-Mail filed an antitrust suit against Google and Facebook Inc. Several other small publishers on Monday filed suits against those two tech companies, citing a deal between them code-named “Jedi Blue.”"
