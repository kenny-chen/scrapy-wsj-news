    "body": "The story in the markets since November’s election has been clear: Massive government spending and Covid-19 vaccinations mean boom times are here, so pile on the risk. Small, cheap, economically-sensitive stocks are good, while bonds, big, bondlike stocks and those that react strongly to interest rates are bad.<br />Yet for the past month, the exact opposite has been the case. The “reflation trade” bet that a pumped-up economy would benefit riskiest assets the most started shortly before Joe Biden was elected, but since March 8, has gone almost perfectly into reverse.<br />The mega-sized stocks beat the merely large, which beat the big, with the small stocks bringing up the rear. Cheap “value” stocks lagged more expensive growth stocks once again, with Big Tech firms such as  Facebook ,   Apple ,   Amazon  and  Microsoft  beating the S&P 500, having trailed it since the election. Bond yields were barely changed. And boring defensive sectors such as utilities and real estate—the stuff you buy when fear rather than greed dominates—did well.<br />I have three theories for why the market didn’t fit the narrative:<br />•It was all about foreign investors. This explanation holds the most hope for the future: Japanese and European investors facing rock-bottom bond yields switched tack and poured money into U.S. Treasurys in the past month to earn more than they could locally, even after hedging the currency risk."
