    "body": "Google has secured one of its largest-ever cloud-computing contracts, Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications Inc., in a deal that shows how the tech giant is leveraging other parts of its operation to drive business to its cloud division.<br />The  Alphabet Inc.  unit, which announced the deal Monday, beat out rival services by packing its offering with benefits across its YouTube video platform, advertising and search services, according to company executives. The deal value could top $1 billion over its eight-year run, according to a person familiar with the terms.<br />That empirewide offering was the deal-clincher, Univision Chief Executive Wade Davis said in an interview. Univision is aiming to turn its U.S. network into a digital platform that reaches Spanish speakers around the world, Mr. Davis said, and working with Google was more attractive than finding a hodgepodge of partners who could meet its needs.<br />“If I want to buy a car, I don’t want to go buy four wheels and a steering wheel and an engine and doors and try and figure out how to put that together,” he said.<br />The Univision deal highlights how tech giants grow by leaning on established products to build budding businesses."
