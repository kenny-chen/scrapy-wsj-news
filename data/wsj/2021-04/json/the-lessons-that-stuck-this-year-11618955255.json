Next week we’ll ask, “What do the Derek Chauvin verdict and its aftermath tell us about America today?” Students can click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before April 27. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />‘On Grand Strategy’<br />Many of us are now taught to divide the world by left and right, black and white, good and evil. The desire to view things in moralistic terms is so strong that many political commentators recast the past as full of men so evil they must be torn from history’s pages. By contrast, John Lewis Gaddis’s “On Grand Strategy” teaches how to live with their contradictions and understand the environments in which they operated.<br />Many of the freedoms we enjoy today were laid down by those who understood how to follow timeless virtues in the imperfect times in which they lived. Lincoln, in Gaddis’s words, “drew strength from contradictions, maybe because he contained so many. They gave him an amplitude.” If you want to achieve good in the world, or achieve any goal in life, you must learn to embrace your contradictions and those of the world around you, understand them, and power through."
