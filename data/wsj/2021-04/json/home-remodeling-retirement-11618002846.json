    "body": "Over the course of 30 years, Laurel LaBauve’s job as a corporate vice president in operations and productivity required her to move 11 times. She and her husband renovated eight of the homes they purchased over that period—tearing down walls, installing sinks and cabinets and laying tile on bathroom floors.<br />“We would literally watch Bob Vila on ‘This Old House’ ” to learn how to do it, she says. She loved every minute of it. And when she retired, she made home remodeling a new career.<br />A mechanical engineer by training, Ms. LaBauve, who is 62 and lives in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, says her job didn’t allow for much creativity. She worked for Merck Sigma from 2006 to 2011 and a veterinary diagnostics company before that.<br />“As I got older, I realized I didn’t want to spend my whole life on airplanes and in conference rooms,” she says. “I wanted to do something I truly loved.”<br />For her and her husband, Richard LaBauve, that was renovating homes."
