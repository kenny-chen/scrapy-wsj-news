    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department added Taiwan to its list of currency manipulators, saying the country’s central bank continues to actively intervene in the foreign-exchange market.<br />Vietnam and Switzerland remained on the list, after receiving the label in January.<br />The designations came in the Treasury’s semiannual report that analyzes foreign-exchange and economic policies of major U.S. trading partners. It was the first report issued under Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.<br />“Treasury is working tirelessly to address efforts by foreign economies to artificially manipulate their currency values that put American workers at an unfair disadvantage,” Ms. Yellen said Friday.<br />The report has traditionally been used as a diplomatic tool to prod countries deemed to artificially weaken their currencies to help domestic businesses against foreign competitors."
