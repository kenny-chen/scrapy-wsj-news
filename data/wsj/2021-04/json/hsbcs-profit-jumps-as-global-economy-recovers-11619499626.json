    "body": "Global banking giant  HSBC Holdings  PLC said quarterly net profit more than doubled, as a nascent economic recovery allowed it to free up funds previously set aside to offset potential pandemic-related losses.<br />The London-based lender, which makes most of its profit in Hong Kong and mainland China, earned a forecast-beating $3.88 billion in the first three months of the year, up from $1.79 billion in the same period last year.<br />“The economic outlook has improved, giving us increasing confidence in our revenue growth plans,” the bank said Tuesday. The lender’s global banking and markets business had a good quarter,  HSBC  said, while growth was solid in areas like wealth management and trade finance in Asia, and in U.K. and Hong Kong mortgages.<br />HSBC reduced provisions for bad loans by $435 million in the quarter, which it said was mostly due to a brighter economic outlook. It had taken more than $3 billion of new provisions in the same period last year.<br />The bank said lower provisions in the U.K., in particular, had helped boost its results. This time last year, it also took a big one-off charge tied to a corporate borrower in Singapore."
