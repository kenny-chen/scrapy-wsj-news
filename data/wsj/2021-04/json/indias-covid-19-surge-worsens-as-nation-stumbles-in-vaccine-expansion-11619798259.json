    "body": "India’s expansion of its vaccination campaign to all adults is stumbling badly, with many people saying they can’t book appointments and states reporting a shortage of vaccines.<br />As the country battles the world’s fastest-growing coronavirus surge, the South Asian nation is opening vaccination on Saturday to everyone age 18 and up, comprising some 900 million people. But many Indians, who have watched helplessly as friends and relatives fell ill from Covid-19 in recent weeks, won’t be able to get them.<br />“The vaccine rollout is already nightmarish,” said Dr. Amir Ullah Khan, research director at the Center for Development Policy and Practice, a think tank based in Hyderabad. “It is not a secret that we have run out of supplies.”<br />The state of Maharashtra, home to the financial capital Mumbai, won’t get fresh supplies of vaccines until after May 20, the state health minister said this week. On Friday, Mumbai shut down its vaccination centers for three days because of vaccine shortages, authorities said.<br />Rajasthan, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand states are all running low on vaccines, health officials said during a joint press conference on Sunday. The health minister of Karnataka, home to the tech hub of Bengaluru, pleaded Friday with everyone under the age of 45 to avoid crowding hospitals over the weekend because inventories are low."
