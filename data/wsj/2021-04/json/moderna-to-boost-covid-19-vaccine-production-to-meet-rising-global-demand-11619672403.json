    "body": "Moderna Inc.  plans to spend billions of dollars to boost production of Covid-19 vaccines and potentially triple its yearly output of doses in 2022, as the company seeks to meet rising global demand.<br />The Cambridge, Mass., biotech company said Thursday it could produce up to three billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines in 2022, compared with a projected output of up to one billion this year.<br />Moderna also said it would make no less than 800 million doses this year, up from a minimum 700 million it had forecast previously.<br />The increased output is a fresh sign that Western Covid-19 vaccine makers, after a slow start, are expanding their manufacturing capabilities as they gain more experience making the shots.<br />It comes as countries like India with rising Covid-19 cases are lagging in vaccination campaigns and searching for more doses that could protect their populations, especially as more contagious variants emerge."
