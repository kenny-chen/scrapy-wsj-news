    "body": "Former President Donald Trump lashed out at top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell during a speech before GOP donors, according to a person present.<br />The remarks Saturday night from Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s Florida estate, indicate his anger toward Mr. McConnell hasn’t abated since losing the election and highlight the challenges the party faces in trying to move on.<br />The former president called the Senate minority leader a “dumb son of a bitch,” according the person who heard the remarks. Mr. Trump also said he was “disappointed” in former Vice President Mike Pence, though he didn’t project the same tension as with Mr. McConnell, according to the person.<br />Mr. Trump had pushed Mr. Pence to block Congress’s certification of Joe Biden as president, but Mr. Pence didn’t, saying such a move had no constitutional basis.<br />The offices of Messrs. McConnell and Pence didn’t respond to requests for comment. A representative for Mr. Trump didn’t respond to a request for comment."
