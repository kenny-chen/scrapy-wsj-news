    "body": "WASHINGTON—U.S. companies sent fewer goods overseas in February amid supply-chain disruptions, winter weather and continued pandemic-related business restrictions around the world.<br />The 2.6% seasonally adjusted decline put U.S. exports at $187.3 billion for the month, marking the first decline since May. That caused the trade deficit to widen 4.8% to $71.1 billion, the largest on record, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.<br />The decline in the exports from the prior month came as various industries, including energy, food, capital goods and automotive vehicles experienced sizable drops in shipments. As the global economy continues to recover from the pandemic’s impact, U.S. exporters have reported delays in shipments, citing congestion at ports, container shortages and steep increases in shipping rates.<br />Imports also declined, dropping 0.7% to $258.3 billion. U.S. purchases of foods and vehicles decreased as consumers pulled back on overall spending during the month.<br />Economists expect the U.S. trade deficit to remain high as its economy recovers faster than in other parts of the world, boosting imports in the coming months."
