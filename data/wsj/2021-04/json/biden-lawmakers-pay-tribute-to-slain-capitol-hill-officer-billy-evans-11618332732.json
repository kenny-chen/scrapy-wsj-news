    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden and congressional leaders paid tribute Tuesday to the late Capitol Police Officer William “Billy” Evans as his casket lay in honor in the Capitol Rotunda after he was killed in the line of duty earlier this month.<br />Mr. Evans, 41 years old, died April 2 when a man drove a vehicle into a barricade outside the Capitol building, injuring one other officer. Police said the driver, identified as 25-year-old Noah Green, got out of his vehicle and threatened officers with a knife before being shot and killed.<br />“He was defined by his dignity, his decency, his loyalty and his courage,” Mr. Biden said in deeply personal remarks addressed to Mr. Evans’s mother, wife and his two children, 9-year-old Logan and 7-year-old Abigail, who held stuffed animals in their laps.<br />“I buried two of my children,” Mr. Biden said. “My prayer for all of you is that the day will come when you have that memory and instead you smile before you bring a tear to your eyes. I promise you it’s going to come, it just takes a while. It takes a while.”<br />Mr. Evans was remembered as devoted to his family and two children, playing board games, Legos and recently finishing reading the Harry Potter series with them."
