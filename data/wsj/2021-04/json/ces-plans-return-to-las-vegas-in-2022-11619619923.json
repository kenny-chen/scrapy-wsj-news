    "body": "CES, the worldâ€™s largest consumer-electronics exhibition, plans to hold its annual convention in-person next year in Las Vegas, a vote of confidence in live events amid optimism that the rollout of vaccinations is slowing the pace of Covid-19 infections.<br />The Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that puts on the event, said CES will begin Jan. 5 with at least 1,000 companies, from  Amazon.com Inc.  to  Sony Group Corp. , already signed up to show off their innovations.<br />The group moved CES to an all-virtual format for 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic, a move that was a blow to the Las Vegas regional economy. CES is typically the largest event by exhibition space in the country.<br />CES will offer a digital option for some attendees next year, allowing them to take in speeches and product announcements from afar.<br />The roughly $11 billion U.S. trade show and exhibition industry is slowly returning to life after the pandemic forced cancellations of conferences and trade shows last year. Many organizers tried to convene events using digital options for attendees to meet with companies over video calls and navigate virtual conference floors."
