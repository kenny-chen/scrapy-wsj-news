    "body": "Apple Inc.  is expected to report record revenue Wednesday for the January-to-March quarter because of surging sales of premium iPhones and pandemic-induced buying of its other products.<br />Demand for new, higher-priced 5G iPhones helped fuel a predicted 32% jump in revenue during Apple’s fiscal second quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet estimate that profit rose 48% compared with a year ago to $16.6 billion off $77 billion in revenue.<br />Investors, like Dan Morgan, are looking for signs that growth is expected to continue in the second half—even as the tech sector struggles with a microchips shortage and other uncertainties stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Some shareholders are evidently jittery. Shares have risen 1.3% this year through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 is up about 12%.<br />“There’s just so little room for error—it makes it really challenging,” said Mr. Morgan, a senior portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Synovus Trust Co., which counts Apple among its largest holdings. “The market always looks six months ahead.”<br />Apple and other tech giants have benefited, as students and workers stuck at home turned to their products in record numbers, pushing share prices to new heights. Apple’s stock almost doubled last year. Its current valuation, as a measure of its price to earnings ratio, is the highest since December 2007, according to FactSet, and has ratcheted up expectations for the company’s results."
