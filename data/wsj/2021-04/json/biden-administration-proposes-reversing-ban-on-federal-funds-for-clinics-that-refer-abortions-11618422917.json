    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration took initial steps to undo a Trump administration policy that stripped federal family-planning dollars from clinics that refer patients for abortions, a move that drove Planned Parenthood to withdraw from the program.<br />The Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday proposed a rule that, when finalized, would reverse the policy on the federal program, known as Title X. The program offers about $286 million each year to clinics that provide reproductive healthcare and other women’s health screenings, such as Pap smears, to about four million uninsured Americans a year.<br />The Trump administration rule, enacted in 2019, called for clinics that received federal funding to physically separate their abortion services in a separate building from all other services, and not to discuss abortions as an option with patients.<br />The change was one of a series of steps the Trump administration took to cut funds for abortion providers, a top concern for religious conservatives, who were a key part of former President Donald Trump’s base and who shaped many aspects of his healthcare policy.<br />Federal dollars have long been prohibited by law from directly funding abortions, though advocates who oppose the procedure say funding to providers like Planned Parenthood, even for other services, essentially subsidizes them and makes it easier for Planned Parenthood and other clinics to provide abortions."
