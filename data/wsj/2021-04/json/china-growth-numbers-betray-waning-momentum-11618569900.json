    "body": "BEIJING—China reported record year-over-year growth of 18.3% in the first three months of 2021.<br />But the more telling figure might be the economy’s 0.6% expansion compared with the quarter before—a historically sluggish pace that suggests momentum is slowing, one year into China’s coronavirus recovery.<br />In the 12 months since its unofficial reopening—authorities lifted the lockdown of Wuhan, the original center of the coronavirus, on April 8 last year—the world’s second-largest economy has defied expectations.<br />For much of 2020, the export sector led the way, with China’s factories churning out great volumes of medical protective equipment and work-from-home computer gear for a world in lockdown. And as authorities stamped out the virus at home, consumers began, gradually, to spend again.<br />The result was full-year gross domestic product growth of 2.3%, making China the only major economy in the world to expand in a pandemic-scarred 2020."
