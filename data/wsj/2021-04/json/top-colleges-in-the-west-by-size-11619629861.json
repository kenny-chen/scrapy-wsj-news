    "body": "The highest-ranked small and midsize colleges in the West are both among the top 10 schools of any kind nationwide in the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings, and the region’s top large colleges include five of the country’s top 10 public schools.<br />The WSJ/THE rankings are based on 15 factors across four main categories: Forty percent of each school’s overall score comes from student outcomes, including measures of graduate salaries and debt burdens, 30% from the school’s academic resources, including how much it spends on teaching, 20% from how well it engages its students and 10% from its environment, a measure of the diversity of its students and faculty.<br />Schools with fewer than 3,000 undergraduates are considered small in these rankings, those with 3,000 to 10,000 undergrads are midsize and those with more than 10,000 are large.<br />The top small college in the West is the California Institute of Technology, ranked No. 7 among all schools nationally. Two other small schools in the region are among the top 50 colleges nationally, Pomona College at No. 24 and Claremont McKenna College at No. 35.<br />The region’s top midsize school is Stanford University, ranked No. 4 among all schools in the country. The next-highest-ranked midsize school in the West is Santa Clara University, at No. 83 among all schools nationwide."
