    "body": "LONDON—Barclays PLC profit soared on stock market trading revenue but an unexpected rise in costs clouded the bank’s performance.<br />The London-based lender, which operates a trans-Atlantic investment bank and a large U.S. credit card business, earned £1.7 billion in the first three months of the year, the equivalent of $2.37 billion, up from £605 million in the same period last year.<br />Barclays shares fell 5% in early trading Friday after the bank said costs rose on higher compensation for investment bankers. While provisions for bad loans fell to £55 million from £2.1 billion in the same quarter last year, other British banks boosted profits by releasing reserves.<br />Citigroup Inc. analysts said in a note the results were “solid” but “the market may have expected even more.”<br />The investment bank results mirrored the strong activity reported by rivals such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley."
