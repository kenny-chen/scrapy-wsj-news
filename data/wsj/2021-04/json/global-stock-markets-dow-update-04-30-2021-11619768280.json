    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged lower Friday as investors assessed fresh waves of Covid-19 infections globally that could hamper global supply chains and drive up inflation.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked down 0.5%, a day after it closed at a record. The broad market index remains on track for its best month since November. Nasdaq-100 futures declined 0.7%, suggesting that technology shares may be among the weakest performers after the opening bell.<br />Rising Covid-19 cases in Brazil and India and signs of weakening in China’s manufacturing sector are sapping some of the optimism that took the major indexes up to all-time highs earlier in the week. New variants are threatening to hobble global travel, convulse supply chains further and slow the recovery, investors say.<br />Signs that the U.S. growth is accelerating are also stoking concern that inflation may rise too much, driven by a persistent shortage of products like electronic chips and the prospect of more fiscal stimulus flooding markets. Persistent inflation can erode portfolio returns.<br />“That is where the market is, wrestling between those two,” said Edward Park, chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald."
