    "body": "BERLIN—One of the world’s most radical anti-gentrification experiments came to an end on Thursday after Germany’s constitutional court declared Berlin’s residential rent cap void.<br />The decision ends months of uncertainty for property owners and renters. Berlin has some of the lowest residential rents of all European capitals but they have also risen very rapidly, nearly doubling over the past decade, persuading the left-wing local government to act last year.<br />Governments from New York City to Paris have introduced measures to control house-price inflation in the era of gentrification. The Covid-19 pandemic—and the stimulus packages, ultralow interest rates and changes in buyer behavior that have come with it—has propelled housing prices even higher around the world.<br />But the Berlin law, passed in February last year, went further than some traditional rent-control legislation by not just freezing rents in the city but also reducing them in many cases.<br />In an initial stage, the law capped the rent of some 1.5 million Berlin rental apartments, or 90% of all rentals, at June 2019 levels for five years. It then mandated maximum rents for buildings based on their age, allowing tenants who paid more than this level to cut their rents."
