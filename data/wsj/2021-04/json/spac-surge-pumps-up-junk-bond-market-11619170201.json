    "body": "The wave of cash raised by special-purpose acquisition companies is rolling into the junk debt market, aiding distressed companies and rewarding investors who own their bonds and loans.<br />SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, have issued roughly $100 billion of stock this year, a record, to buy private companies and take them public. Some SPACs are targeting companies with below-investment-grade credit ratings, hoping to use their cash piles to pay down debt and grow the businesses.<br />Not since the dot.com-boom two decades ago has stock-market enthusiasm been hot enough to fuel such activity in debt markets, bond investors and analysts say.<br />Mutual funds managers that owned WeWork bonds booked paper gains of 25% after the ailing shared-office provider started merger talks in January with a SPAC, according to MarketAxess. Companies with junk credit ratings are typically required to buy back their debt, often at a premium, when a change of control occurs via a merger. Loans of Cyxtera Technologies Inc.—which credit-rating companies recently warned was in danger of default—jumped 16% in February when the data-center operator agreed to merge with one of the blank-check companies, according to AdvantageData Inc.<br />“There’s a lot of deja-vu of the late 1990s happening in the high-yield market right now,” said Michael Anderson, a managing director for credit research at  Citigroup Inc."
