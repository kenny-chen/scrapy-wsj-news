The best responses will be published that night.<br />A Job for Government<br />Although their corner offices and executive assistants might make them seem invincible, CEOs who don’t perform don’t last. During the 1980s, performance meant profitability. If an executive met the quarterly earnings goals, he avoided termination. This focus on short-term performance had its flaws, but at least executives had clear instructions: make money. In today’s environment, executives are expected to make their firms profitable, environmentally friendly and socially responsible—the triple bottom line, a term coined by British management consultant John Elkington in 1994.<br />The triple bottom line has created expectations of executives that aren’t only vague, hard to meet and outside their expertise, but also sometimes incompatible with profitability. If we want a more efficient and less politicized corporate leadership, expectations must be recalibrated.
