    "body": "Merck  & Co. and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP said they are stopping a trial of their experimental Covid-19 drug after it failed to help hospitalized patients, delivering another setback to doctors seeking treatments to use for the disease.<br />The companies said they would move forward with a separate study that is testing the oral antiviral drug in treating patients early in the course of the disease and who are at high risk of Covid-19 complications.<br />Early study results on hospitalized patients found that the treatment is unlikely to reduce hospitalization stays and deaths, the companies said Thursday.<br />Merck said testing found that the drug, called molnupiravir, inhibits replication of the virus. But the trial of people who werenâ€™t hospitalized was too small to show that the drug reduced clinical symptoms during their early treatment, Merck said.<br />If the drug is proven effective in outpatients after the next, larger round of testing, Merck could file for an emergency-use authorization in the second half of this year, the company said."
