    "body": "Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rose slightly in March, reversing course from the previous month when ongoing supply-chain challenges for U.S. factories helped fuel the first monthly decline in close to a year.<br />New orders for durable goods—products designed to last at least three years, such as computers and machinery—increased 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted $256.3 billion in March when compared with February, the Commerce Department said Monday.<br />Orders for durable goods have increased 10 out of the last 11 months. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 2.2% gain, after an upwardly revised 0.9% decrease the previous month.<br />Low business and retail inventories and increased demand during the pandemic have translated to increased demand for manufacturers for much of the past year, but supply-chain issues continue to constrain production and delay some shipments.<br />Consumer spending, boosted by government stimulus payments and the rising number of Covid-19 vaccinations, has been gaining ground in recent months. That has especially helped restaurants, hotels and airlines, some of the industries hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic."
