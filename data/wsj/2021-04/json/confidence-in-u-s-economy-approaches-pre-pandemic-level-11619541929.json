    "body": "Consumers’ outlook on the economy has increased for four straight months as vaccination totals rise, businesses more fully reopen.<br />Consumers’ confidence in the U.S. economy rose sharply in April as more people received vaccinations, stimulus payments reached households and businesses more fully reopened.<br />The consumer confidence index increased to 121.7 in April from a revised 109.0 in March, the Conference Board said Tuesday.<br />Recent improvements led the index to a more than one-year high, with the indicator approaching the pre-pandemic level of 132.6 in February 2020.<br />“Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks,” said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board."
