Rescue workers could be seen on television and video clips shared on social media running into the site trying to navigate large crowds of people.<br />Yossi Goldhirsh, who was at the scene with his children, told Israel’s Ynet news that shortly after the ceremonial fire was lighted he could see “waves of people being run over and crushed.”"
