    "body": "PARIS—In the aftermath of the yellow-vest protest crisis, President Emmanuel Macron vowed to abolish the Ecole Nationale d’Administration, the finishing school of the French elite that has become a lightning rod for antiestablishment sentiment.<br />On Thursday, Mr. Macron finally made ENA’s abolition official while announcing plans to create a new school for France’s elite with a familiar formula.<br />The new school’s location will be ENA’s current campus in Strasbourg. Like ENA it will train students in the art of statecraft. Even the name of the new school, Institut du Service Public, has a bureaucratic ring worthy of its predecessor.<br />In a Thursday videoconference with France’s top civil servants, however, Mr. Macron insisted this wasn’t a case of plus ça change.<br />“As you can see this is a profound revolution,” Mr. Macron said."
