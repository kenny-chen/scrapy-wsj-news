    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s push to pass an infrastructure bill with bipartisan support will soon be put to the test as the White House prepares to meet with lawmakers next week and Democrats assess their options for advancing his $2.3 trillion plan.<br />Republicans have attacked the proposal, rejecting its proposed increases in corporate taxes. They have also criticized the breadth of the plan, which proposes spending $621 billion on transportation, along with $300 billion for domestic manufacturing, $180 billion for research and development and $400 billion for long-term care for elderly and disabled people under Medicaid, among other items.<br />At the same time, top Republicans have said they would be open to passing an infrastructure bill—if it was much narrower than what the White House has proposed.<br />“I think infrastructure could be one of the biggest bipartisan successes for this nation,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said to a local California television station this week.<br />With narrow majorities in the House and Senate, Democrats could move forward with an infrastructure bill without any Republican votes. But that would require obeying a number of restrictive rules to pass the bill with a simple majority in the Senate and forgoing an opportunity to notch a bipartisan victory."
