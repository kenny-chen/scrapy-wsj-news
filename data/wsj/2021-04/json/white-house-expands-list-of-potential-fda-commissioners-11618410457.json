    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration has expanded its shortlist of candidates to lead the Food and Drug Administration, according to people familiar with the situation, who say several women of color are now in the running.<br />Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock was once considered likely to be nominated for the job permanently, but that prospect has been clouded by Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and other senators calling on President Biden to bring in new FDA leadership.<br />The White House has also been under pressure to name more Asian-Americans to high-ranking posts following a recent series of attacks on that population.<br />Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D., Ill.) and Mazie Hirono (D., Hawaii) briefly said last month they would withhold their votes on some nominees unless Mr. Biden addressed representation for Asian-Americans at the highest levels of the government.<br />One of the candidates for FDA Commissioner is Katherine Luzuriaga, a Filipina-American who is director of the University of Massachusetts Medical School’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science, said one person familiar with the process. Dr. Luzuriaga didn’t respond to a request for comment."
