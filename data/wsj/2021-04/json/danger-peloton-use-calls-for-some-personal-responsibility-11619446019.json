    "body": "The issues surrounding the Peloton treadmill are a great example of a real problem in our society (“Peloton Faces Mounting Pressure,” Business & Finance, April 20). It involves the confluence of an overreaching government and an abrogation of personal responsibility. The potential hazards of a treadmill are what the law calls “open and obvious” to any reasonable person—like fire, a moving air fan or an oncoming train.<br />Accidents do happen, and sometimes the consequences are tragic, but that doesn’t mean someone else is always responsible for an injured person’s negligence and inattention. Our courts are bogged down with frivolous lawsuits based on the belief that people are no longer responsible for their own actions. Someone else is always to blame.<br />Norman Jetmundsen<br />Birmingham, Ala."
