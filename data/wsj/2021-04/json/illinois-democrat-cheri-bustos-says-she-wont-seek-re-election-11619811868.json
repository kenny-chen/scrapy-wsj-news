    "body": "WASHINGTON—Rep. Cheri Bustos, one of a handful of Democrats representing districts President Biden lost in 2020, said she won’t seek re-election next year, a move that comes after a disappointing run as the chief of the party’s campaign arm.<br />In a statement, the 59-year-old Illinois lawmaker attributed the decision to a need for a professional change, following careers as a journalist and then in corporate communications, but didn’t say what she planned to do next.<br />“As I turn every corner on each decade of life, I take time to reflect and evaluate what my next chapter might bring. That’s how, 10 years ago, I decided to run for Congress. And it’s why, today, I am announcing I will not seek reelection after completing this term.”<br />Ms. Bustos left her post as Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair following the election, in which Democrats lost several seats in the House that they predicted they would hold, and failed to flip GOP seats, sharply narrowing their majority. The losses angered Democratic lawmakers, with centrists and progressives pointing fingers at each other over the party’s messaging and campaigning efforts.<br />Ms. Bustos, who represents a district that former President Donald Trump won in 2016 and 2020, according to data compiled by Daily Kos, campaigned for the position by telling members of her caucus that she understood Trump voters. Only seven Democrats currently represent districts Mr. Trump won in 2020."
