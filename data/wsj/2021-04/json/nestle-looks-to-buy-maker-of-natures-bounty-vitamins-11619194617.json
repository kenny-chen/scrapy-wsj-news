    "body": "Nestlé SA is in talks to buy the maker of Nature’s Bounty vitamins for a price in the mid-single-digit billions, according to people familiar with the matter, as the Swiss food giant pushes further into nutritional offerings.<br />Nestlé could finalize a deal to buy the Bountiful Co. as soon as next week, some of the people said, though it isn’t guaranteed they will reach an agreement. Bountiful has been planning an initial public offering and could still opt for that path after all, or a different deal.<br />In addition to Nature’s Bounty vitamins, Bountiful’s brands include Pure Protein, which makes protein bars, Osteo Bi-Flex joint-care supplements and Puritan’s Pride vitamins and supplements.<br />Bountiful is majority-owned by private-equity firm  KKR  & Co. In a filing for the IPO earlier this month, Bountiful called itself the largest pure-play nutrition company in North America and one of three largest in the world.<br />Nestlé has signaled it plans to make bigger acquisitions this year and that bulking up in nutrition is a priority as wellness becomes increasingly important for consumers. With 8.6 billion Swiss francs in cash at year-end (equivalent to $9.4 billion now) and a market value of about 310 billion francs, it certainly has the wherewithal to do a deal for Bountiful."
