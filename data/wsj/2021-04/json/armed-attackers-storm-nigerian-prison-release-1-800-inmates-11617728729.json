    "body": "ABUJA, Nigeria—More than 1,800 inmates escaped from a prison in Nigeria’s southeast after it was attacked by gunmen on Monday, raising fears that a new armed insurrection is building in a majority Christian part of the country while the Muslim-dominated north is grappling with jihadist militancy and rampant criminal gangs.<br />Dozens of armed attackers entered the prison yard in the town of Owerri at around 2 a.m., according to local officials and eyewitnesses. The gunmen used explosives to blast open the administrative buildings and then opened the cells.<br />The assault, which lasted several hours, was among a series of coordinated nighttime attacks in which gunmen also targeted police and military facilities with rocket-propelled grenades and explosives in the capital of Imo state.<br />“We’re very afraid of what happens next,” said Blessing Iwe-Ajunwa, an Owerri resident who heard volleys of gunshots through the night. “Many prisoners have melted into the community.”<br />President Muhammadu Buhari said the jail break was an “act of terrorism” carried out by anarchists. He called on security forces to capture the attackers and the escaped prisoners."
