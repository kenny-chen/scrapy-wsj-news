    "body": "LONDON— Royal Dutch Shell  PLC detailed a first-of-a-kind shareholder vote over its pivot away from oil, asking investors to endorse its energy transition strategy in a nonbinding vote next month.<br />While environmental groups have long put forward climate-related resolutions at annual shareholder meetings, Shell’s move is the first by an oil major to set up a regular review of its progress in moving away from oil.<br />The decision to offer shareholders a vote comes as energy companies face increasing investor pressure to map out their future in a lower-carbon economy, where oil and gas demand is forecast to fall, with the rollout of technologies such as electric cars and wind and solar power.<br />Earlier this year,  Exxon Mobil Corp.  outlined plans for a low-carbon business unit after some shareholders argued it should focus more on investments in clean energy, while  BP  PLC has pledged to cut oil output by around 40% over the coming decade and invest more in renewable energy.<br />Shell laid out plans in February to reduce its dependence on oil, saying it would cut output by 1%-2% a year, while boosting spending on low-carbon energy."
