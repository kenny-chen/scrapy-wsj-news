    "body": "Like every area of our lives in the past year, the world of movies has been upended, transformed, battered and reinvented. Theaters were shuttered. Blockbuster releases were postponed—then postponed again. Major studios embraced direct-to-streaming (albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm). And in all this madness, even while we’ve been wedded to our screens as never before, it’s been harder than usual to keep up with this year’s major titles.<br />Last month, the nominations for this year’s Academy Awards were announced. The ceremony will take place on Sunday, April 25. Below you’ll find the Best Picture competitors—plus titles in other major categories—and reactions from the Journal’s film critic Joe Morgenstern.<br /><br /><br />Directed by Florian Zeller; written by Christopher Hampton, based on the play by, Florian Zeller; starring Anthony Hopkins, Olivia Colman and Mark Gatiss"
