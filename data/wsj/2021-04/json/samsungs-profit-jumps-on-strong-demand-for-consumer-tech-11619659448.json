    "body": "SEOUL— Samsung Electronics Co. ’s first-quarter net profit rose 46%, boosted by a greater appetite for the South Korean tech giant’s gadgets and appliances that softened the financial hit from a temporary shutdown of its U.S. semiconductor production.<br />The world’s largest smartphone and memory-chip maker reported a net profit of 7.14 trillion South Korean won, or the equivalent of about $6.4 billion, up from 4.88 trillion won the prior year. Revenue rose 18% to 65.4 trillion won for the three months ended March 31.<br />Samsung is a proxy for the global tech world, making a wide range of electronic gadgets while serving as a components supplier for its biggest rivals.<br />In recent years, the Suwon, South Korea-based firm had cashed in on chips. But Samsung’s Texas semiconductor production was shut down for weeks earlier this year due to severe weather. As a result, operating profits for chips dipped 16% to 3.37 trillion won.<br />The facility is now fully operational, though the disruptions meant about 71,000 wafers were affected, leading to damage of around 300 billion to 400 billion won, said Shawn Han, a senior vice president for Samsung’s foundry business, during Thursday’s earnings call. Samsung is talking with local authorities and utility companies about how to avoid a similar shutdown in the future, he added."
