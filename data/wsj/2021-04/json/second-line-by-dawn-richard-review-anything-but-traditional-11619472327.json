    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />Dawn Richard began her professional life in music as part of the industry machine but now occupies a space all her own. The 37-year-old singer-songwriter grew up in New Orleans, the daughter of a musician—her father, Frank, was the lead singer in the funk band Chocolate Milk, active in the 1970s and early ’80s—and a dance teacher, and in 2005 she was selected to be on “Making the Band,” a reality series starring producer and record executive Sean “Diddy” Combs. She became a member of Danity Kane, the quintet that emerged from the show, and the girl group put out two chart-topping LPs in the late 2000s. And Ms. Richard was prominently featured on another project helmed by Mr. Combs, the 2010 album “Last Train to Paris,” which hit the top 10 and garnered critical notice for its lustrous mix of rap, R&B and pulsing European club music. After making an impact on television and the charts and having worked closely with a famous pop mogul, Ms. Richard seemed positioned for a career on a major label. But she took a different path."
