    "body": "SYDNEY— Orocobre Ltd.  agreed to buy rival Australian miner  Galaxy Resources Ltd.  in an all-stock deal that would create a $3 billion miner and one of the world’s biggest producers of lithium, a commodity used in batteries for electric vehicles and other high-tech products.<br />The deal comes at a time when lithium prices are climbing because of concerns about shortages of the commodity and a bigger-than-anticipated electric-vehicle boom. Orocobre runs the Olaroz lithium operation in northern Argentina, while Galaxy runs the Mt. Cattlin mine in Australia and has projects under development in Argentina and Canada.<br />Based on the companies’ closing share prices on Friday, a combined company would have a market value of 3.96 billion Australian dollars, equivalent to $3.06 billion. If the deal consummates, the new miner would be the fifth-largest global lithium miner, the companies said.<br />Orocobre will acquire all of the shares in Galaxy, whose shareholders will receive 0.569 Orocobre shares for each of their own stock. Orocobre shareholders will own 54.2% of the combined group and Galaxy shareholders will own the remaining 45.8%.<br />Galaxy Chairman Martin Rowley will become nonexecutive chairman of the combined group, with Orocobre Chief Executive Martín Pérez de Solay becoming CEO."
