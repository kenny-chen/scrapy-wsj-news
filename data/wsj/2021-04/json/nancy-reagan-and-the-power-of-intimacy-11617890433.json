    "body": "First lady is a role that comes with no mandate and no job description. But there is one thing that many of them have learned the hard way: When the word “powerful” is used about a president’s spouse, it is rarely intended as a compliment.<br />Few first ladies have had a rockier go of it than Nancy Reagan, who was alternately scorned as a shallow, pre-feminist throwback and portrayed as a calculating power behind the throne. The names that she was called along the way include The Iron Butterfly, Fancy Nancy, The Evita of Bel-Air, Mommie Dearest, The Ice Queen and Attila the Hen.<br />When the future first couple met in late 1949, Ronald Reagan was a broken man—literally. He showed up for their first date leaning on two canes, after having spent months in traction from an accident that shattered his thighbone in a half dozen places.<br />Spiritually, Reagan was in what he described as a “deep freeze.” He was approaching middle age and his movie career, never particularly illustrious, was hitting bottom. His first wife, Jane Wyman, had gotten bored with him and walked out, taking their two children with her. And he carried with him the emotional scar tissue of his precarious childhood as the son of an alcoholic.<br />“Then along came Nancy Davis,” he would later say, “and saved my soul.”"
