    "body": "Once upon a time, it was pretty simple to compose a political strategy for a big American corporation: Give some political contributions to mainstream Republican politicians who could be counted on to push agreeable tax and regulatory policies, find a few dollars for some moderate Democrats to provide a bit of bipartisan insurance, and then keep your mouth shut when political debates flared up.<br />Well, those were the good old days. Today, the strategy of writing the check and then crouching on the sidelines increasingly is being overtaken by corporate activism in the political arena.<br />The question is: Why now?<br />The signs of this new climate are pretty obvious, and widely noted. Some business leaders and their companies openly objected to Republican attempts to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election and cut off contributions to lawmakers who supported the effort. Coca-Cola Co. and Delta Air Lines Inc. publicly objected to a new law on voting procedures in their home state of Georgia.<br />Hundreds of business leaders and companies, including  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and  Netflix Inc.,  last week signed onto a two-page ad in The Wall Street Journal and other publications declaring that they “defend the right to vote and oppose any discriminatory legislation,” an implicit rebuke of voting bills Republicans are pushing in dozens of states."
