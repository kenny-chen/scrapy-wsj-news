    "body": "Professional tennis player Sloane Stephens has joined the ranks of professional athletes investing in startups, backing caffeine-infused energy bar maker Quantum Energy Squares.<br />In February, Ms. Stephens invested in the Quantum snack’s parent, Curated Healthy Energy Foods Inc., alongside a small group of other angel investors, including her fiancé Jozy Altidore, a Major League Soccer player, according to PitchBook Data Inc. Michael Bryan and Sam Querrey, both professional tennis players, also allocated capital to the company, the data provider said.<br />Ms. Stephens, winner of the 2017 U.S. Open tennis championship, said the investment is an extension of her personal interest in certain products.<br />The move by Ms. Stephens follows a number of celebrities and athletes who have jumped into startup investing in recent years.<br />For example, Tonal Systems Inc., the San Francisco-based creator of an at-home digital weight machine, counts professional athletes among its existing investors, including Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson of the NBA’s Golden State Warriors and tennis champion Serena Williams. The company last month raised $250 million for its Series E funding round."
