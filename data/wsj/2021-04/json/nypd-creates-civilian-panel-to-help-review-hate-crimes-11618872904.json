    "body": "The New York Police Department is creating a civilian panel to help address a rise in hate crimes in New York City, department officials said Monday.<br />The NYPD Hate Crime Review Panel will help officers identify potential hate crimes occurring in New York City, New York Police Department Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a briefing Monday to discuss the panel.<br />Mr. Shea said the panel will assess circumstances that present challenges in establishing whether race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, disability or sexual orientation were motivating factors in possible hate crimes. The NYPD will send cases it considers challenging to the panel for its recommendation to help determine whether evidence the department has gathered might indicate a hate crime.<br />The panel will work on crimes targeting all races. Its five volunteer members include Devorah Halberstam, co-founder and director of external affairs of the Jewish Children’s Museum, and Fred Teng, president of the America China Public Affairs Institute, Mr. Shea said.<br />“Unfortunately, today we are facing nearly daily reports of hate crimes. We need to help stop this,” Ms. Halberstam said."
