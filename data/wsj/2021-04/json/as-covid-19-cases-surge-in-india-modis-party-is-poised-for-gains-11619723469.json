    "body": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party appeared set to make significant gains in a fiercely  contested state-level election, exit polls showed, after he and other politicians drew criticism for holding campaign rallies attended by tens of thousands as a Covid-19 wave accelerated.<br />On Thursday, India reported yet another global high for new daily cases at more than 379,000 in a surge that has overwhelmed the healthcare system in hard-hit cities like New Delhi, where hospitals have been turning patients away and running out of oxygen and Covid-19 medications.<br />Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was poised to win as many as 130 seats in the West Bengal state legislature after taking only three seats in the previous election in 2016, according to an aggregation of six exit polls reported by New Delhi Television.<br />That still would put the prime minister’s party behind the state’s governing Trinamool Congress party, which the exit polls indicated would hold on to 152 seats. The party is led by Mamata Banerjee, a powerful regional politician who has at times been an outspoken critic of Mr. Modi.<br />Indian exit polls have at times been unreliable. The official tally is due on Sunday."
