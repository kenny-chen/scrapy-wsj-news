    "body": "Kimberly-Clark Corp.  delivered its worst sales performance in at least a decade, hit by supply-chain disruptions, continued business shutdowns and fallout from last year’s toilet paper hoarding amid the pandemic.<br />The maker of Huggies diapers and Cottonelle toilet paper reported an 8% decline in organic sales, which strips out deals and currency moves, for the quarter ended March 31. Sales in its consumer-tissue segment, which includes toilet paper, Scott paper towels and Kleenex tissue, fell 14%.<br />It is a sharp reversal from 2020 when the world’s consumers, stuck at home and hyper focused on cleaning, drove a 6% increase in organic sales for the year as they loaded up on paper towels, cleaning products and other household staples. Consumer-tissue sales last year rose 14%.<br />“I am not pleased with the results,” Kimberly-Clark CEO Michael Hsu said in a call with analysts. He said that while the company expected slower consumer-tissue sales, the extent to which consumers stopped buying toilet paper came as a surprise.<br />Kimberly-Clark’s shares fell more than 5% Friday morning."
