    "body": "In “Not Every ‘Serious Crisis’ Is Alike” (op-ed, April 19), Rahm Emanuel writes that, unlike the 500,000 jobs losses a month that faced President Obama upon taking office, President Biden faced the loss of “nearly 500,000 lives—perhaps half of which could have been saved.” Given the enormous complexities of the pandemic, it is impossible to know how many lives might have been saved if we had done this and not that, or that and not this. But we know what Mr. Emanuel means: President Trump caused all those unnecessary deaths.<br />Well, prove it. Show the evidence. Responsible people know this can’t be done. And it really serves no purpose to assign a particular number of deaths to this leader or that one. It is partisan politics at its worst.<br />Bill Hinchliff<br />Chicago<br />"
