    "body": "Apple Inc.<br />A podcast fight between Apple and  Spotify Technology SA  is getting louder. Apple unveiled new products Tuesday that include a subscription podcast service, while Spotify has said it plans to launch a subscription-podcasting model. The music-streaming company has been among Apple’s most prominent corporate critics; it claims Apple uses its strength to compete unfairly, a charge the tech company denies. Apple shares lost 1.3% Tuesday, and Spotify shares fell 3.3%.<br />GameStop Corp.<br />It is game over for GameStop’s chief executive. George Sherman will leave his post by July 31, the latest in a series of changes to the videogame retailer’s leadership team since Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen became a board member. Mr. Sherman has been leading the company since April 2019. GameStop agreed to allow Mr. Sherman to retain more than one million shares of restricted stock, worth nearly $175 million as of Friday, as part of a separation agreement. The company has been working with a search firm to evaluate candidates for the role, focusing on people with a background in the technology or videogame industries. GameStop shares rose 6.3% Monday.<br />Tesla Inc."
