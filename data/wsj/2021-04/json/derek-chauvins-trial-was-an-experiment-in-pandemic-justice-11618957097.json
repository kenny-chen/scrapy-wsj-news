    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS—As the Derek Chauvin trial unfolded over the past several weeks, it was the first time most people around the country got a glimpse into the strange new reality of a jury trial during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Mr. Chauvin Tuesday afternoon was convicted on three counts, including second-degree murder, in the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose death last May in police custody was captured on video that went viral.<br />The participants wore masks almost all of the time except when they were speaking, when they were shielded by plexiglass barriers. Instead of huddling at the judge’s bench, private conversations between attorneys and the judge were hashed out over headsets while white noise played to obscure the conversations from the jurors.<br />And instead of sitting close together in a typical jury box, the jurors were spaced out in what looked like school desks.<br />When the verdict was read, Mr. Chauvin sat motionless with a medical mask obscuring most of his face. Only his eyes were observable, darting back and forth as the judge read the verdict. His attorney Eric Nelson looked at Mr. Chauvin after the verdict was read but didn’t touch him before he was handcuffed and led away."
