    "body": "Netflix Inc.’s  subscriptions soared last year as the Covid-19 pandemic curtailed big parts of economies globally. The company must now contend with people looking to leave the house more and a growing number of competitors.<br />Netflix’s subscriber base jumped by roughly 37 million on a net basis during 2020 to reach 204 million by the end of December, a performance that further cemented its powerful status in the content-streaming market. Executives at the Los Gatos, Calif., company have said the pandemic pulled forward demand because alternative entertainment options dried up.<br />“There’s a boost in engagement that you get when people are in a lockdown situation,” Netflix operations chief Gregory Peters said at an investor event last month.<br />Many consumers who get vaccinated are venturing out of their homes more and shifting spending despite the lingering threat posed by coronavirus. Airlines are looking for a resurgence in summer travel. Movie theaters and other venues have reopened in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere. Restaurants and hotels, both hard hit by pandemic-related closures and restrictions, have stepped up hiring.<br />For the first quarter, Netflix has said it expects to add six million new subscribers, less than half of the 15.8 million it gained for the year-earlier period, when the spread of the coronavirus was first intensifying. The company also forecast $1.36 billion in net income on $7.13 billion in revenue for the period."
