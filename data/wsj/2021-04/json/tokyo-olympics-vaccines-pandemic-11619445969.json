    "body": "With the Tokyo Games less than three months away, the International Olympic Committee has held up recent sports championships as evidence that they can proceed safely even during a pandemic.<br />“Look at the Augusta Masters,” IOC president Thomas Bach suggested in a news conference last week, saying the golf tournament proceeded with “no problem” and produced its first Japanese champion, Hideki Matsuyama.<br />The Masters, however, featured 88 golfers from 23 countries—in one tournament in one sport that is inherently socially distanced. The Summer Olympics, set to begin July 23, would draw about 11,000 athletes from more than 200 countries, to compete in a 33-sport, 339-session, two-and-a-half-week-long mega-event.<br />No sporting competition even approaching the scale of the Olympics has been held during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Some epidemiologists who’ve worked on helping make pandemic events safe say it might be possible to re-create their protocols for the Olympics, as long as they take one key step: requiring that everyone is vaccinated."
