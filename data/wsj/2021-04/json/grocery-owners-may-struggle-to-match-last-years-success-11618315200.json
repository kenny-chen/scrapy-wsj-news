    "body": "Owners of grocery stores were among the biggest real estate winners last year. Now, some property owners worry that the business looks poised to slip this year.<br />Pandemic lockdowns forced restaurants to close and then limit service, but supermarkets and grocery stores were spared because they were deemed essential. Customers stocked up on food and other goods. Those dynamics helped boost U.S. grocery sales by 11% in 2020, more than triple the growth of the previous two years, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.<br />But as more Americans get vaccinated, they are showing a desire to eat out again and may spend less money filling up their cupboards and refrigerators. Grocery owners are competing against each other to grow their e-commerce business while delivery companies like Instacart Inc. expand aggressively. And  Amazon.com Inc.  is entering neighborhoods with its new grocery chain, taking on some stores that had faced little bricks-and-mortar competition.<br />Some of last year’s hardest-hit property types, like hotels and retail centers, have rallied this year in anticipation of pent-up demand for travel and other experiences outside the home.<br />Now, it’s grocery store owners’ turn to face fresh headwinds and new competition."
