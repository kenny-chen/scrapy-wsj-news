    "body": "President Biden has promised not to raise taxes on “anyone” (presumably any family) earning less than $400,000 a year. But I thank Kevin Hassett (“The Biden Plan for Economic Sclerosis,” op-ed, April 9) for exposing how we all will pay for the president’s spending binge, well beyond what’s needed for pandemic relief or infrastructure.<br />Mr. Hassett states, “Democrats have never cared about paying for the trillions in pandemic-relief spending,” confident that “taxes aren’t necessary to finance spending when government can print money.” Each new dollar demotes the buying power of every existing dollar, whether as income or retirement savings. Thus, without even increasing taxes per se, Mr. Biden can in effect tax all families.<br />Governments cannot create wealth; they can only redistribute it. Middle-class families earning well below $400,000 will share with the wealthy the burden of Mr. Biden’s spending binge—“tax-free.”<br />Phil Barnes<br />San Pedro, Calif."
