    "body": "Verizon Communications Inc.  is exploring a sale of assets including Yahoo and AOL, as the telecommunications giant looks to exit an expensive and unsuccessful bet on digital media.<br />The sales process, which includes private-equity firm  Apollo Global Management Inc.,  could lead to a deal worth $4 billion to $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter—assuming there is one. Other details couldn’t be learned.<br />Verizon splashed out billions of dollars assembling a portfolio of once-dominant websites, including AOL in 2015, and Yahoo in 2017, paying more than $9 billion in total to acquire the pair.<br />Verizon, the country’s largest wireless carrier in terms of subscribers, bought the websites intending to resurrect brands that had lost traffic since their heyday but still counted a base of hundreds of millions of account holders.<br />It reorganized the businesses in 2017 under former AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong, dubbing the combined division “Oath” and signaling its intention to go head to head with digital-advertising powerhouses like  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and  Facebook Inc."
