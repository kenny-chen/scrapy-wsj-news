    "body": "The company behind the Satan Shoes will offer to repurchase the customized sneakers from consumers, resolving a lawsuit filed by Nike Inc. after the footwear created a social media splash.<br />Nike  said it settled Thursday its legal dispute with MSCHF Product Studio Inc. over the shoes, which were released in March as part of a publicity campaign for rapper Lil Nas X.<br />“MSCHF has agreed to initiate a voluntary recall to buy back any Satan Shoes and Jesus Shoes for their original retail prices, to remove them from circulation,” Nike said in a statement.<br />“We’re thrilled with the way this case has been resolved,” David Bernstein, a lawyer at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP representing MSCHF, said Thursday. “MSCHF from the start distributed these shoes to make a statement and thanks to the lawsuit and all of the publicity that came from it that statement reached far more corners than we expected.”<br />“These shoes were never about making money. MSCHF made these shoes to make a point about how crazy collaboration culture has become,” Mr. Bernstein said, noting that the shoe “appeared to be a collaboration with Satan.”"
