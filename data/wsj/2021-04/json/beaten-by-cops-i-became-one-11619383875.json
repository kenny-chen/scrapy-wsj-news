    "body": "Brooklyn, N.Y.<br />As the coronavirus pandemic rolls on, New York City is battling an epidemic of crime. It’s the same battle we’ve been fighting for decades. Violence is on the rise. New Yorkers don’t feel safe in their homes or on the street. Many are avoiding the subways out of fear.<br />As a former police officer who patrolled the streets in a bulletproof vest in the 1990s, I know what I am talking about when I say public safety is the prerequisite to prosperity. All New Yorkers, no matter which neighborhood they live in, should be allowed to feel safe. But the debate around policing has been reduced to a false choice: safety or justice.<br />Every New Yorker needs public safety. We need the police. We also need them to be much better than they are. I know this firsthand because I was brutally beaten by cops as a teenager in South Jamaica, Queens, while in custody at the 103rd Precinct. It was a traumatic experience and the reason I became a police officer. I wanted to change the New York City Police Department from the inside. As an officer on the street, I learned that good cops can save lives.<br />To protect people from violent crime and prevent police abuse, we need to recognize that the same communities suffer from both. We must also recognize that reducing crime restores trust, and that measures to restore trust reduce crime when communities work with police to stop violence."
