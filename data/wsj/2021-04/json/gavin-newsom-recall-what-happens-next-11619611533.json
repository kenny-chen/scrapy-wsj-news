    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom is almost certain to face a recall election in the fall of 2021 after California’s secretary of state confirmed on April 26 that election officials have verified 1.63 million signatures on a recall petition. Just under 1.5 million verified signatures were needed.<br />Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, has said he is prepared for a recall election. “The reality is, it looks like it’s going on the ballot,” he said at a press conference in March. “We will fight it, we will defeat it. At the same time, it’s not going to keep me from focusing on my job 24-7.”<br />Here’s how the recall effort started and what happens next.<br />This is the sixth attempt by Republican activists to qualify a recall of Mr. Newsom since he was elected in 2018; the other five have failed.<br />The most recent push is championed by a retired sheriff’s deputy and Northern California resident named Orrin Heatlie. In November, a Sacramento County judge granted Mr. Heatlie extra time to gather signatures, citing closures due to the coronavirus pandemic that had hampered his efforts."
