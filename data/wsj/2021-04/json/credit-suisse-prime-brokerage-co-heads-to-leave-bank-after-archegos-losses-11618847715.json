    "body": "Credit Suisse  Group AG said two executives in charge of its prime brokerage unit will leave in the wake of its $4.7 billion loss from the collapse of hedge fund Archegos Capital Management.<br />In an internal memo Monday, it said John Dabbs and Ryan Nelson will immediately step down as co-heads of prime services, and assist the bank through mid-May for an orderly transition.<br />Their departures come after Credit Suisse pushed out its top risk officer and the head of its investment bank this month. Several other employees working in equities and risk management also left.<br />Credit Suisse and other banks racked up heavy losses when Archegos, a U.S. family investment firm, couldnâ€™t meet margin calls on large, concentrated stock positions at the end of March.<br />Credit Suisse was slow to unwind its positions compared with other banks and was left with the heftiest loss. It lent more to Archegos relative to its size than other lending banks, The Wall Street Journal previously reported."
