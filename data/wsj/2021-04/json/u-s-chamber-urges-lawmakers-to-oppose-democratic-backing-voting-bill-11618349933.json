    "body": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged senators to oppose a sweeping Democratic-backed voting-overhaul bill, saying it would impose onerous restrictions on political advocacy by corporations and other associations.<br />The Chamber said Tuesday that it would send a “key vote alert” to senators laying out its opposition to the proposed For the People Act and called for bipartisanship in making any voting changes.<br />“The Chamber believes the ability of Americans to exercise their right to vote in accessible and secure elections and to be able to trust in a free and fair outcome is fundamental to who we are as a nation,” said a draft of the Chamber’s letter that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. “The Chamber is deeply troubled by efforts at the state and federal level to enact election law changes on a partisan basis.”<br />Congressional Democrats’ roughly 800-page bill would make many changes to rules regarding voting and campaign finance. Its proposals include requiring every state to offer early in-person voting and voting by mail, loosening requirements for voter ID and creating independent panels to draw voting districts in each state to end partisan gerrymandering.<br />The bill also would restructure the Federal Election Commission in a way that proponents say would make the agency more effective but critics say would turn it into a partisan tool."
