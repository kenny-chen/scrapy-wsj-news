    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department will investigate whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in patterns of unconstitutional policing, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Wednesday, a day after a state jury convicted former officer Derek Chauvin in the killing of George Floyd.<br />The wide-ranging inquiry, known as a pattern-or-practice probe, will go beyond a separate federal criminal investigation into Mr. Floyd’s killing last year. The new examination will seek to determine whether Minneapolis officers routinely violate citizens’ rights through excessive force, discriminatory policing or other behavior.<br />The Justice Department already has begun reaching out to community groups and the public to learn about their experiences with Minneapolis officers, Mr. Garland said.<br />A state jury on Tuesday convicted Mr. Chauvin of murder and manslaughter in Mr. Floyd’s killing in May, which set off nationwide protests over policing in the U.S. and bipartisan calls for change.<br />“Yesterday’s verdict in the state criminal trial does not address potentially systemic policing issues in Minneapolis,” Mr. Garland said. “Building trust between community and law enforcement will take time and effort by all of us. But we undertake this task with determination and urgency, knowing that change cannot wait.”"
