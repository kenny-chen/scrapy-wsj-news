    "body": "CHICAGO—The city of Chicago filed a lawsuit Monday against an Indiana gun shop it says is responsible for the flow of hundreds and possibly thousands of guns into the nation’s third-largest city, making it one of the largest out-of-state sellers of guns used in crimes here.<br />The lawsuit against Westforth Sports Inc. of Gary, Ind., is seeking the appointment of a special master to oversee the store’s operations and assure that it abides by federal gun laws for a period of five years, as well as monetary damages.<br />“These eye-popping numbers are not the result of bad luck or coincidence or location,” the lawsuit says. “They are the natural and predictable outcome of a business model that ignores the federal laws and regulations that are intended to keep the public safe.”<br />Earl Westforth, president of the store, declined to comment.<br />“This lawsuit is about addressing a major source of illegal guns recovered in our city, and it should send an unmistakable signal about our commitment to reducing gun violence and stopping gun trafficking,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said."
