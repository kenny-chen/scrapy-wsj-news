Surrre.<br />Yet I have one request for you when iOS 14.5 arrives on your iPhone and privacy pop-upalooza begins: Read them. Lucky for you, they’re short and crucial to understanding how your most personal info is used.<br />As for how you choose to answer these prompts, I have some advice on that, too.<br />On Monday, after many months of anticipation,  Apple  released iOS 14.5. The update isn’t as big as the full-digit release that typically arrives each September, but it does have a few useful upgrades."
