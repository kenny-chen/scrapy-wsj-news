    "body": "How to explain the rush of bad government, citing false crises, end-running constitutional limitations, that the Biden presidency in its early days has become?<br />I’m persuaded by one of its practitioners, Charles Blow of the  New York Times ,  that a key feature, the administration’s rampant race-baiting, is partly a matter of a ticking clock: “If Hispanics and Asians vote then the way they vote now—a third of each group voted for Trump—their combined votes for Republicans will eclipse the Black vote for Democrats.” He means for good.<br />Other clocks are ticking too. Mr. Biden is likely to be a one-term president; every historical precedent suggests the Democrats’ slim congressional majority won’t survive next year’s midterm elections.<br />This still doesn’t explain why Mr. Biden is lending his presidency to unrepresentative activist groups to pursue an agenda for which he has no mandate. So much for the talk of a modest and dignified “transitional” presidency. He, or someone on his behalf, has substituted a Tijuana-or-bust progressive Hail Mary that is quickly becoming needlessly and noxiously divisive, that has Mr. Biden uttering lies and demagoguery as scurrilous as any his predecessor uttered.<br />Maybe he really has changed due to some woke epiphany. Or maybe we are seeing a man of diminished capacities acting out one long reaction to Kamala Harris playing the race card on him in the 2020 primaries."
