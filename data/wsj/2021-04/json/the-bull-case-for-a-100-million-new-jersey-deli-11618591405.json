    "body": "The $100 million delicatessen is the talk of Wall Street. But why be salty about it?<br />As an example of wild speculation in markets, hedge-fund manager David Einhorn flagged the case of  Hometown International  in a recent letter to his investors. Hometown, owner of a single deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, recently attained a market value in excess of $100 million, despite booking just over $35,000 in combined sales over the past two years.<br />That tops the per-store value of even the highest-flying restaurant stocks— Chipotle Mexican Grill  has a market value of around $43 billion, which puts its 2,768 locations at about $16 million apiece. Of course, those locations generated an average of $2.2 million in sales in 2020.<br />But in a stock market that could hardly be more forgiving, Hometown International will have a chance to grow into its lofty valuation. It could expand into new product sales like cigarettes or lotto tickets—two categories not mentioned in its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And with just one location in the Philadelphia suburbs, expansion opportunities abound, from Perth Amboy to Piscataway. That is to say nothing of the “international” wing of its business promised in its name.<br />Besides, Hometown shares were down sharply on Friday morning, slicing that valuation to just $80 million. Deep value is just around the corner in the Garden State."
