    "body": "While U.S. softwood-lumber duties clearly have made it more expensive for Canadian lumber producers to ship across the border (“Why Are Home Prices Soaring?” Review & Outlook, April 8), Canadian imports have declined for a different reason. More than two billion board feet of sawmilling capacity in British Columbia have been shuttered since 2019 due to timber losses caused by insect infestation and wildfire. The region has lost 15% of its total output capacity.<br />This decline occurred while annual U.S. demand for lumber has increased by more than 2.5 billion board feet. Builders in the U.S. can’t buy enough lumber to meet demand, irrespective of the prevailing tariffs. As demand has outpaced supply, lumber prices have broken $1,000 per thousand board feet. Most Canadian mills can produce lumber profitably at $400 per thousand board feet or less. The addition of 9% tariffs wouldn’t prevent them from matching or beating any price a U.S. producer would seek.<br />Chung-Hong Fu<br />Timberland Investment Resources<br />Brookline, Mass."
