    "body": "U.S. stock futures rose Thursday on the prospect of as much as $1.8 trillion in new government spending that could spur economic growth.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 added 0.7%, suggesting that the broad-market index may resume its march toward a fresh record after the opening bell. Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 1%, suggesting that major technology stocks will drive gains.<br />The stock market rally is poised to resume after President Biden outlined proposals on Wednesday for his new American Families Plan, which would boost spending on child care, education and paid leave. Investors’ optimism was also buoyed after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would continue supporting the economy, while noting signs that growth has revived and the labor market is strengthening.<br />“In this environment, it is very difficult to be bearish,” said Gregory Perdon, co-chief investment officer at private bank  Arbuthnot Latham .<br />A high level of household savings is morphing into consumer spending as the economy reopens and will also deliver a boost, he added. “I struggle to see any factor over the course of the next six months that would outweigh this ready-steady-spend narrative.”"
