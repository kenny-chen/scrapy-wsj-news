    "body": "Dogecoin is a joke cryptocurrency that on Tuesday was briefly worth $54 billion. Is that a sign that the entire market is in a phase of wild excess? My answer: On its own no—but with some major caveats.<br />Before explaining, start with the joke. Pretty much every serious person who mentions dogecoin points out that it was created as a parody, back when dozens of new e-coins were being set up. That is true, but shouldn’t be a barrier: If something is useful, the intent of its founders shouldn’t put us off.<br />The first woman elected to public office in the U.S. only got there because she was nominated as a prank.  Facebook  originated in Mark Zuckerberg’s drunken creation of FaceMash, a way for his peers at Harvard to rate the attractiveness of female students. And if the intent of the creator mattered, bitcoin would rank as a total failure, since it was created to allow small online payments, and instead is hoarded or used for speculation.<br />Dogecoin has found a use, of sorts, as a way of tipping Reddit users for funny or informative social media posts, and in principle is a perfectly good cryptocurrency, as these things go.<br />This isn’t to endorse its value. It is dominated by a bunch of people having a laugh and putting money behind the joke, while others are wagering on the outcome—leading to the huge surge and huge fall Wednesday. It is no more likely to replace the dollar than are betting slips for the Kentucky Derby."
