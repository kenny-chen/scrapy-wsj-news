    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration plans to make an additional 22,000 seasonal guest-worker visas available this year ahead of the summer season, according to people familiar with the decision.<br />This is on top of the current 66,000 visas now available annually to seasonal employers, including landscapers, resort owners and county fairs, which look to add staff for their busy seasons.<br />The decision comes just weeks after the Biden administration lifted a ban on the guest-worker visas and other work visas imposed by the Trump administration last June amid the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. A small number of the total additional visas will be set aside for applicants from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, which together are sending the largest number of migrant families and children to the U.S. border seeking asylum, the people said.<br />It couldn’t be determined when the administration plans to announce the additional visas, or when they might become available to businesses.<br />The seasonal-worker program, known as the H-2B visa program, enables U.S. employers to hire as many as 66,000 temporary foreign workers a year, with the allotments split evenly between the winter and summer seasons."
