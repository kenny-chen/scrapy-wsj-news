    "body": "A far-left activist in Peru who pledges to seize foreign mines and the daughter of a former authoritarian president will face each other in a presidential election that gives voters two starkly different ideological options in a country battered by political turmoil and the pandemic.<br />The election pits Pedro Castillo, a 51-year-old former schoolteacher who says he would nationalize mining projects and dismantle a business-friendly economic model, against Keiko Fujimori, whose father ruled Peru with an iron hand.<br />That Mr. Castillo, who leads a Marxist-inspired party that glorifies Fidel Castro, could win office is rattling a business class that has prospered as Peru’s trade-friendly economy boomed for much of the last two decades. Among major investors here are subsidiaries of  Anglo American  PLC, Newmont Mining Corp. of Denver, and  Aluminum Corporation of China .<br />“We’re often told that only political scientists, constitutionalists, erudite politicians, those with grand degrees can govern a country,” Mr. Castillo told supporters recently. “They’ve had enough time.”<br />Speaking to reporters Tuesday, he said he sees this election as a “competition between the rich and the poor...I see a fight between the boss and the laborer, the master and the slave.”"
