    "body": "A global divide is widening between rich nations that are quickly vaccinating their populations against Covid-19 and poor countries that are lagging badly behind, aggravated by a devastating outbreak in India that is helping to drive daily infections world-wide to their highest level yet.<br />The dramatic climb in Covid-19 cases in India, which has fully inoculated less than 2% of its 1.4 billion people, is further disrupting stuttering efforts to vaccinate in developing nations.<br />Last month, the Indian government restricted exports of vaccines, slowing the supply to other poor nations that had counted on the manufacturing might of India’s pharmaceutical industry to protect their own citizens. Many developing countries have vaccinated only a tiny portion of their population, including front-line health workers.<br />In particular, India’s export restrictions are highlighting a major weakness in the World Health Organization-backed Covax initiative, a program financed mostly by Western governments to distribute free shots to 92 low- and middle-income countries.<br />The majority of Covax’s supplies for this year—including vaccines developed by the joint effort of the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC as well as by U.S.-based  Novavax Inc. —are being produced in India. Officials working with Covax say there is little clarity on when large-scale shipments will resume."
