    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. government in 2018 approved a new natural gas pipeline in the Northeast and gave the developer federal eminent domain power to acquire the land to build it. New Jersey objected when the builder then moved to take state property. What happens now?<br />The Supreme Court faced the puzzle Wednesday during oral arguments in which justices expressed competing sympathies about federal energy projects and states’ rights.<br />The case, which could have broad implications for the natural-gas industry, centers on a 116-mile interstate pipeline that PennEast Pipeline Co., a joint venture of several energy companies, wants to build through Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized the project and, under the Natural Gas Act, that approval allowed the company to use federal power, if necessary, to take possession of the land it needed.<br />PennEast said it was able to negotiate rights of way with most property owners, but went to court in its bid to take dozens of parcels of land—with compensation—in which the state of New Jersey holds a property interest.<br />Lawyer Paul Clement, arguing for the company, said the federal government validly gave it the legal right to do so."
