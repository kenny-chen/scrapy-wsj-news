    "body": "MOSCOW—President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would deliver a swift and harsh response to any foreign threat, a warning that comes amid a vast Russian military buildup at the border with Ukraine that has stirred fears of an invasion.<br />Speaking at his annual state of the nation address, Mr. Putin accused other nations of unfairly targeting Russia and cautioned against crossing “the so-called red line” in regard to his nation. He said Russia would decide where that line should be drawn.<br />“We really do not want to burn bridges,” Mr. Putin said Wednesday. “But if anyone mistakes our good intentions for indifference or weakness and plans to burn or even blow up those bridges, they should know that Russia will respond asymmetrically, swiftly and harshly.”<br />Russia’s military buildup, mounting cease-fire violations and increasingly heated rhetoric between Moscow and Kyiv have raised concerns of an escalating conflict.<br />Western officials estimate that Russia has deployed between 80,000 and 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border, larger than the force the Russians deployed when they seized Crimea in 2014 and sent troops into eastern Ukraine."
