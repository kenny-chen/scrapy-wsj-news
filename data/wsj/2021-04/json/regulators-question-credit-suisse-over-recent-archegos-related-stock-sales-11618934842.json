    "body": "Regulators in Switzerland and the U.S. asked  Credit Suisse Group AG  for more information in recent days about additional stock sales related to the collapse of Archegos Capital Management, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The sales could result in additional losses that go beyond the $4.7 billion hit the bank disclosed earlier this month, one of the people added, and any additional losses are expected to be small in relation to the earlier amount.<br />Since disclosing the loss, Credit Suisse has looked to unload roughly $4 billion in stock tied to Archegos, including a sale as recently as last week, according to people familiar with the trades. Regulators asked Credit Suisse for information about the sales and any potential losses, the people said, and how the bank is managing its exposure to Archegos.<br />A Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment.<br />The recent regulator questions are part of a broader investigation into the bankâ€™s relationship with Archegos and its wind down, one of the people added."
