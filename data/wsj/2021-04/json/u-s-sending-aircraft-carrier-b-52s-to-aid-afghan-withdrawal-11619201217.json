    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Pentagon is sending B-52 bombers to the Mideast alongside an aircraft carrier as a signal to Taliban militants that the U.S. intends to ensure a peaceful withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan, officials said.<br />The White House on Friday is expected to approve the temporary deployment of the carrier and as many as six B-52 bombers as a way to protect American and North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces as they leave Afghanistan starting in less than two weeks, the officials said. President Biden announced on April 14 that he was ending the American role in the 20-year-old conflict.<br />An Army Ranger unit is also expected to be sent to support the drawdown of forces, the officials said.<br />The withdrawal of about 3,500 American forces from Afghanistan is expected to be complete as early as mid-July, although Mr. Biden set a deadline of Sept. 11 as the ultimate date for the withdrawal.<br />"
