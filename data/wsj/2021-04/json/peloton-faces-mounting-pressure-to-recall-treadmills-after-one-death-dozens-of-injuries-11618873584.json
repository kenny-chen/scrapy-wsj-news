    "body": "Pressure mounted on  Peloton Interactive Inc.  on Monday when the chair of a House consumer-protection subcommittee called on the company to recall its treadmills.<br />The move comes days after a federal safety agency told people with young children or pets to stop using the treadmills and urged a recall of the product, which it says is responsible for dozens of injuries and at least one death.<br />Peloton has called the advisory by the Consumer Product Safety Commission “inaccurate and misleading.” On Sunday, Peloton CEO John Foley said in a letter to customers that it has “no intention” of stopping sales or recalling the machines.<br />The company had no immediate response to Monday’s statement by U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D., Ill.), who chairs the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee.<br />“The videos and reports of children being sucked under Peloton treadmills are harrowing, and they graphically illustrate the grave and immediate risks these products pose to users and their families,” Ms. Schakowsky said."
