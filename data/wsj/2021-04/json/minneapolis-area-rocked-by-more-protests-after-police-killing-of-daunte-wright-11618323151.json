Mayor Mike Elliott said at a press conference Tuesday that Police Chief Tim Gannon also resigned.<br />Mr. Wright, 20 years old, was killed Sunday when Ms. Potter accidentally shot him with her gun instead of her Taser during a traffic stop, police said. The killing sparked protests and clashes with police on Sunday and Monday nights.<br />Authorities said early Tuesday that 40 people were arrested for rioting and breaking curfew at police headquarters Monday night. Some businesses that were damaged and looted spent Tuesday cleaning up.<br />Mr. Elliott said during the Tuesday press conference that he was appreciative of Ms. Potter’s resignation, and that he agreed with that decision. He said she notified the city shortly before 10 a.m., and she wasn’t asked to resign. Ms. Potter is a 26-year veteran of the force."
