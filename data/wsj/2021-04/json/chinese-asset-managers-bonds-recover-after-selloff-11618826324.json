    "body": "A steep selloff affecting tens of billions of dollars of offshore debt from a major Chinese financial institution has partially reversed, after comments from the banking regulator helped reassure investors.<br />However, China Huarong Asset Management Co.’s international bonds were still trading considerably below face value on Monday. Some market participants said a further rally would require more clarity on Huarong’s financial health and any potential restructuring.<br />The bonds had tumbled after Huarong unexpectedly missed an end-March deadline to release its 2020 financial results, pending what it called a “relevant transaction,” and with little more information from Huarong or Chinese authorities. Investment-grade offshore bonds from other Chinese companies had also come under pressure.<br />On Friday, Chinese regulators broke their earlier silence, in a statement that investors said was positive because it showed authorities were engaged with the issues, even if it was brief and broad.<br />“From the current situation, the operation of several financial asset-management companies is stable, the main operating indicators, regulatory indicators are in a reasonable range. Please rest assured,” said Xiao Yuanqi, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission."
