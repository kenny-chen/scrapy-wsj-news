    "body": "HONG KONG—China sent a core component of its new space station into orbit, marking a key milestone in the country’s ambitions to establish a permanent presence in space.<br />The 22-ton Tianhe module will eventually serve as the life-support and control center for taikonauts, as Chinese astronauts are called. It was launched Thursday morning from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on Hainan, an island off China’s southwestern coast.<br />China is planning a series of other launches into orbit this year, some of which will combine with Tianhe to form the Tiangong, or Heavenly Palace, space station. The country plans for the permanent space base to be operational by next year. It is seen as a rival to the much larger International Space Station, the multinational base involving space agencies including NASA.<br />“The successful launch of the Tianhe core module indicates that the construction of our country’s space station has entered the stage of full implementation and lays a solid foundation for subsequent missions,” Chinese President Xi Jinping was quoted as saying by state media agency Xinhua.<br />Mr. Xi said that the construction of the space station and the completion of a national space laboratory were important goals for China’s manned spaceflight project and an important step toward the nation becoming powerful in science, technology and aerospace."
