    "body": "Vaccitech PLC, a British company that co-invented the  AstraZeneca  PLC Covid-19 vaccine, closed its first day of trading with shares down 17%.<br />American depositary shares of the company, an offshoot of University of Oxford research efforts, closed Friday at $14.10, compared with their initial public offering price of $17 a share.<br />Vaccitech came to prominence over the past year because of its Covid-19 vaccine work. Its vaccine, marketed by AstraZeneca, has been one of a handful of shots invented at blistering speed to combat the pandemic, relative to the typically plodding pace of pharmaceutical development.<br />More recently, however, the vaccine has experienced a rocky world-wide rollout amid safety concerns and production challenges.<br />Vaccitech was co-founded five years ago by two University of Oxford professors, Adrian Hill and Sarah Gilbert. Its technology focuses on priming the bodyâ€™s immune system to fight disease."
