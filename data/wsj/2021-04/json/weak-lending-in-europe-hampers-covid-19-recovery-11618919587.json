    "body": "Demand for business loans in the eurozone fell and banks tightened credit standards in the first quarter of this year, a toxic combination that challenges the bloc’s slow economic recovery from the pandemic.<br />According to the European Central Bank’s latest lending survey released Tuesday, demand from companies for loans and credit lines fell for the third quarter in a row. The ECB said businesses seem to be postponing investments, as the pandemic triggers fresh lockdowns and other restrictions in many parts of Europe.<br />European companies tend to rely more heavily on bank lending than U.S. counterparts. That makes demand and supply of loans a key gauge of the health of the region’s economy, and one closely followed by the ECB when setting its monetary policy.<br />The dour survey weighed on financial markets Tuesday. An index of eurozone bank shares dropped by more than 2%. Yields on benchmark German 10-year bunds slipped to minus 0.25% from minus 0.24% a day earlier.<br />The sluggish lending will be seen as a frustration for the ECB, which has unleashed massive stimulus into the economy through bond buying, cheap lending to banks and negative interest rates, as a way to counteract the effects of the pandemic. It accelerated its bond buying program in March, in part to lean against tightening credit conditions."
