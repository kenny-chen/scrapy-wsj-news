February marked the highest annual rate of price growth since February 2006.<br />Demand for homes has surged in the past year as mortgage interest rates held near record lows. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose in 2020 to their highest annual level since 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors.<br />The supply of homes for sale fell to a record low in January and stayed at that level in February, NAR said. Mortgage-finance company  Freddie Mac  recently estimated that the U.S. housing market is 3.8 million single-family homes short of what is needed to meet the countryâ€™s demand.<br />The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 11.7% over the year ended in February, compared with a 10.9% increase in January.
