    "body": "WASHINGTON—A bipartisan group of lawmakers is set to meet with President Biden Monday about his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal, as Republicans and Democrats seek to determine whether they can reach an agreement on such a package’s size, scope and funding.<br />The meeting is the latest in a series the White House has held with lawmakers on Capitol Hill involved in infrastructure funding and policy, though it will be the first since Mr. Biden rolled out his framework. At previous meetings, lawmakers have brought up different methods of paying for the infrastructure spending, according to people familiar with the meetings.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki said ahead of the meeting Monday that the Democratic president is committed to working with congressional Republicans.<br />“He looks forward to hearing their ideas, and his objective is to find a way forward where we can modernize our nation’s infrastructure so we can compete with China,” Ms. Psaki said. She said that Mr. Biden had proposed a way to pay for the plan and that “he hopes they’ll come to the table with ideas.”<br />Many of the lawmakers invited to the earlier meetings serve on committees that deal with infrastructure, including the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee."
