    "body": "Johnson & Johnson  said Friday there wasn’t enough evidence to establish that the company’s Covid-19 vaccine causes the rare blood-clotting condition that prompted U.S. health officials this week to recommend a pause in its use.<br />The New England Journal of Medicine published online a letter from three J&J employees involved in vaccine development and epidemiology saying, “At this time, evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship between these events” and J&J’s vaccine.<br />U.S. health authorities this week recommended a pause in vaccinations using J&J’s single-dose vaccine while they investigated six cases of a rare blood clot, combined with low blood-platelet counts, in women who had received the J&J vaccine. One of the women died.<br />The pause is expected to remain in place at least until a federal vaccine-advisory committee meets April 23 to review the matter.<br />After U.S. health officials recommended the pause, J&J said it was aware of the events and working with health authorities investigating them. A J&J executive said at a U.S. vaccine-advisory panel meeting this week that causality hadn’t been fully established between the clot events and its vaccine, but the company recognized they could be a potential risk with the vaccine."
