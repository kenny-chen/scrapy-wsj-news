    "body": "Tim Payton isn’t sure when the pandemic will allow him to attend his next soccer match at Arsenal’s home stadium in London. But he can tell you for sure that he won’t be wearing the team’s red-and-white jersey.<br />“I imagine going dressed in funeral clothes,” said Mr. Payton, a season ticket-holder for more than 35 years and a board member of the club’s supporters’ trust. “I imagine going to lay a wreath outside.”<br />To be clear, no one is dead. Yet fans of 12 of Europe’s most ancient, storied and successful soccer teams, including Arsenal, are in a state of bewildered mourning this week, following the unveiling of a lavishly funded Super League that would irrevocably alter the landscape of the sport.<br />These supporters have unleashed a tsunami of anger at their own teams—even though those clubs would be the direct beneficiaries of the proposed league.<br />Under the new plan, a small group of elite teams from England, Spain, and Italy—already some of the wealthiest sports enterprises in the world—would compete in a new circuit that would only enrich them further. Opponents say that would undermine the integrity of wildly popular national competitions, like the English Premier League and the main pan-European competition, the UEFA Champions League."
