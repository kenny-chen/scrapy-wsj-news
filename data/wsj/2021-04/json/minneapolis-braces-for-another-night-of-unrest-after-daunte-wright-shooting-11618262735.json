    "body": "BROOKLYN CENTER, Minn.—Protesters called for police accountability Monday evening in this Minneapolis suburb, a day after the shooting death of a 20-year-old Black man, Daunte Wright, whose death police described as a tragic accident.<br />The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension identified Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center police force, as the officer who police say accidentally shot and killed Mr. Wright after discharging her gun instead of her Taser during a traffic stop Sunday.<br />Ms. Potter couldn’t be reached late Monday, and a union official declined to comment.<br />Katie Wright, Mr. Wright’s mother, spoke Monday evening at a rally at the site where he was shot by police. At the Brooklyn Center Police Department, about 2 miles away, protesters shouted and banged drums, chanting, “No justice, no peace” and “Our streets, our streets.” Others chanted Mr. Wright’s name. Some threw water bottles at police and set off fireworks. Windows at a Dollar Tree store across the street were broken and the store was looted.<br />Police said protesters were violating curfew and lobbed chemicals at the crowd. Fences and jersey barriers surround the department."
