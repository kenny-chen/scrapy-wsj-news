    "body": "This spring, the always reliable but somewhat staid sweater vest has re-entered the fashion scene as a must-have layering piece for the season’s changeable weather. Sweater vests typically bring to mind school uniforms, a way of subduing individual expression. But this year designers have taken the standardized classic and turned it into a wardrobe staple and conversation piece.<br />Some fashion houses played with the proportions, as did Gucci, with its blown-up argyle and slouchy fit, or Etro, which shrank its version down to a cool crop-top style in creamy pastel.  Louis Vuitton  and Tory Burch chose to elevate their vests with geometric ’70s-style patterns woven into more modern, fitted silhouettes. In surveying the sweater-vest trend overall, WSJ.’s senior fashion editor Lizzy Wholley found that this spring’s iterations had a more carefree, tomboy attitude than the preppy, polished look associated with classic versions.<br />To balance out the sweater vest, add some volume by way of puffed sleeves from The Row or Sea New York or even go bare-armed as the heat index rises. Whatever option you choose, sweater vests can be part of a new kind of uniform, one full of individual expression and personal style. —Kevin Huynh<br />Model, Luisana González at Next Management.
