    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />Onstage earlier this month at Roulette, a Brooklyn performance space, Jen Shyu did many things: She knelt while strumming a moon lute, the two-stringed instrument of her father’s homeland, Taiwan. She chanted in the Resuk language of East Timor, her mother’s birthplace. She played piano, one of the first instruments she mastered as a child. She banged a metal spoon against a pot. Throughout she sang, in English and others among the 10 languages she speaks, of personal loss and a shared sense of disorientation."
