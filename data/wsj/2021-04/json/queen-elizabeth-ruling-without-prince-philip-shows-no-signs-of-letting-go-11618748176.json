    "body": "On Wednesday, Queen Elizabeth, newly widowed and still officially in mourning, will turn 95.<br />Little fanfare is expected. Since her husband, Prince Philip, died on April 9, the queen has undertaken a period of silence. Britain hasn’t heard from its longest-serving monarch but has merely observed her, most recently sitting masked and alone as her husband’s coffin was lowered into the royal vault in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.<br />Yet during that period she has continued to do what she has done for nearly seven decades as monarch: work.<br />Four days after Prince Philip’s death, the queen attended a retirement ceremony for a royal courtier who had been instrumental in planning her husband’s funeral. She later took a phone call from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.<br />The monarch, unlike Queen Victoria, who disappeared from public view for several years after her consort died in 1861, will continue her long record of public service, palace officials say."
