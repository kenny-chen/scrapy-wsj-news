Alfred Lord Tennyson’s poem “The Lotos-Eaters” doesn’t offer answers. Rather it offers a glimpse of what it might look like to conclude that earthly toil is no longer worth it. I’ve read the poem two or three times a year since 1999, when I first encountered it. Neither the quandaries of middle age nor the follies of each day’s headlines have lessened its relevance.<br />The poem, published in 1832 when the poet was 23 years old, begins as a ballad depicting the episode in Book IX of the “Odyssey” in which Odysseus and his men arrive on an island where the inhabitants subsist on a diet of lotus-tree fruit. (Tennyson opts for the less common transliteration of the Greek, lotos.) When some of Odysseus’ men eat the fruit, they fall into a trance and decide to give up the work of finding their way home.<br />Tennyson uses the episode as a kind of metaphor for complete resignation: the feeling that maybe it’s better to surrender, disengage from the world and its troubles, and live mainly for rest and mindless pleasure.<br />The opening lines are the only ones in which an unnamed Odysseus speaks:<br />“Courage!” he said, and pointed toward the land,"
