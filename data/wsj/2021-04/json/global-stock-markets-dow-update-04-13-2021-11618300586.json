    "body": "U.S. stock futures held steady Tuesday ahead of fresh data that is expected to show consumer prices climbed sharply in March.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 wavered between gains and losses. The broad-market index is hovering near its recent record closing high. Futures on the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 ticked down 0.1%.<br />Investors in both stocks and bonds are seeking to assess whether the projected U.S. economic recovery will trigger a sharp rise in inflation that may remain for a protracted period. Policy makers have repeatedly said they expect any increase over the next few months will prove to be fleeting. A sharp uptick in inflation expectations earlier this year led to a rise in bond yields, and damped appetite for richly valued technology stocks last month.<br />The U.S. consumer price data for March is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.<br />“The equity market is a bit stretched in valuation,” said Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Allianz. “If yields are going a bit higher on the back of stronger inflation, a lot of institutional investors could rotate their portfolios out of very risky equities to less risky bonds and still get quite a comfortable margin.”"
