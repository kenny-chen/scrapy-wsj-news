    "body": "A bullish profit forecast from China’s largest container-shipping company sent its stock soaring and offered fresh evidence of how the industry is thriving thanks to robust global trade flows.<br />Freight rates have surged over the past year, with shipping groups reaping the benefits of earlier capacity cuts combined with stronger-than-expected demand. And while the recent Suez Canal blockage has created huge logistical headaches, it hasn’t spoiled that positive picture. If anything, port backlogs and other snarls have provided further support to freight rates.<br />Late Tuesday,  Cosco Shipping Holdings Co.  said it expected this year’s first-quarter net profit to total 15.41 billion yuan, or the equivalent of $2.3 billion. That compares with $44 million for the first three months of 2020.<br />Shipping rates rose nearly 54% compared with the fourth quarter, Cosco Shipping said, citing the widely tracked China Containerized Freight Index. The company controls the world’s third-largest container carrier by capacity.<br />The company’s Hong Kong shares jumped 29% on Wednesday to their highest since August 2008. Its Shanghai-traded stock rose by the daily trading limit of 10%."
