    "body": "China is investigating delivery giant  Meituan  over suspected antitrust practices, the latest move by Beijing to tighten its grip on the country’s increasingly powerful tech industry.<br />China’s top market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation, on Monday said it had launched a probe into Hong Kong-listed Meituan for suspected monopolistic behaviors, including the practice of so-called “er xuan yi,” or “choose one over two.” The practice prevents merchants from selling their goods on multiple platforms.<br />Meituan, which acts as an online marketplace for restaurants and other merchants, said it would actively cooperate with the investigation and seek to improve its compliance management. It added that its various businesses are currently operating normally.<br />The investigation comes after dozens of China’s largest technology companies, including Meituan, earlier this month publicly pledged to comply with antimonopoly laws after Beijing blocked the initial public offering of Ant Group Co. and hit tech giant  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  with a record $2.8 billion fine.<br />Meituan had said in its pledge that it won’t adopt unreasonable restrictions to force merchants into exclusivity measures."
