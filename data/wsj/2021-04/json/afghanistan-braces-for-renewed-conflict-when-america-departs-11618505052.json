    "body": "KABUL—Afghanistan’s beleaguered government will be on its own against the Taliban once American forces withdraw in September. The strength of the insurgency, combined with internal disarray in the administration of President Ashraf Ghani, suggests Kabul could find it hard to hold out for long.<br />U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Kabul to reassure Afghan leaders on Thursday that America’s “partnership is enduring,” despite President Biden’s determination to extricate the U.S. from a 20-year conflict.<br />But many in the Afghan capital said they fear the pullout sets the stage for a renewed civil war, possibly one in which some of Afghanistan’s neighbors—India, Russia, China and Iran—will be playing a much more significant role.<br />“We don’t know if Afghanistan will become the new Syria,” said Timor Shah Mohseni, a 48-year-old shopkeeper in central Kabul.<br />Even before this week’s decision by Washington, tensions had been mounting within the uneasy coalition of Afghan power brokers—led by Mr. Ghani—brought together by their mutual hostility to the Taliban and now running the national government."
