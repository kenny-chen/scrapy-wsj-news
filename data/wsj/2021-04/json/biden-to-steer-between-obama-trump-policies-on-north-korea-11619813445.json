    "body": "The Biden administration intends to steer a middle course in negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs between former President Donald Trump’s top-level summitry and the Obama administration’s patient stance, U.S. officials said.<br />The U.S. will retain the eventual goal of denuclearizing the country, the officials said in sharing the broad conclusions of a month-long review of policy toward Pyongyang. But it will pursue more graduated measures to roll back North Korean’s nuclear and missile arsenal.<br />“Our policy will not focus on achieving a grand bargain, nor will it rely on strategic patience,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.<br />“Our policy calls for a calibrated, practical approach that is open to and will explore diplomacy with the DPRK, and to make practical progress that increases the security of the United States, our allies and deployed forces,” she added, using the acronym for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.<br />U.S. officials didn’t provide important details of their policy or negotiating strategy, including what the Biden administration would hope to accomplish in the first phase of an accord with Pyongyang and what economic sanctions it might ease in return."
