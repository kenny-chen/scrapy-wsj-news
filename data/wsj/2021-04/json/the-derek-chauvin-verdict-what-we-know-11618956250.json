    "body": "A Minnesota jury found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, age 45, guilty on all three counts in the death of George Floyd, a Black man whose fatal arrest last year on May 25 was captured on video and set off a wave of protests calling for racial justice and changes to policing practices.<br />What did the jury decide?<br />The jury found Mr. Chauvin guilty on all three charges that he faced.<br />When is sentencing and what are the parameters?<br />Sentencing will happen in eight weeks. Mr. Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison for second-degree unintentional murder, the most serious charge. Because Mr. Chauvin has no prior felonies, state sentencing guidelines recommend a range of around 11 to 15 years for his crimes, but prosecutors said they would seek a harsher sentence."
