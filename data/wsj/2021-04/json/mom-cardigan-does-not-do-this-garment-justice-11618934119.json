    "body": "“Clothing That Dates You” (Off Duty, April 10) calls draping Eileen Fisher cardigans “mom cardigans” and notes they are designed for a “widening behind.” Comfortable yet refined, these flowing garments are empowering. They warm us on cold planes and in offices and transition from plane to corporate board meeting (often several times a week). Many also have pockets that allow us to carry our phones, pens and notes hands-free. These are all important and have nothing to do with covering my behind, which doesn’t need covering.<br />The “mom” reference and instructions on how to avoid a “mumsy look” are pejorative. I’m a mother, wife, friend, law-firm partner and trusted adviser to many. I have a wardrobe that allows me to be all these things, and it involves several of these cardigans.<br />I will resist addressing the many sustainability issues raised by your article, including the suggestion that readers exchange one pair of dated sustainable shoes for another.<br />Nicole Marie Crum<br />Bethesda, Md."
