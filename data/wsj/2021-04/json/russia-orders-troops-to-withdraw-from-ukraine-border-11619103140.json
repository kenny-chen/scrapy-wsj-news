    "body": "Russia’s Defense Ministry ordered some of its troops to begin withdrawing from the Ukrainian border in a move that could help de-escalate tensions with Kyiv and the West, but its continuing military presence in the volatile region appears likely to keep nerves on edge.<br />On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned adversaries that Moscow would deliver a swift and harsh response to any foreign threat amid a vast buildup of forces along the frontier between the two countries.<br />The defense ministry said it had deployed more than 10,000 personnel and 1,200 units of equipment to participate in military exercises in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, in what it had described as a snap test of combat readiness in response to “threatening military activities” by the U.S. and its partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.<br />These troops would be deployed back to their permanent bases by May 1, defense officials said Thursday.<br />But an undisclosed number of troops have also been deployed for exercises along Russia’s western border near eastern Ukraine, where a conflict has been festering between Kyiv and Kremlin-backed separatists. The defense ministry didn’t say when they would be returned to base."
