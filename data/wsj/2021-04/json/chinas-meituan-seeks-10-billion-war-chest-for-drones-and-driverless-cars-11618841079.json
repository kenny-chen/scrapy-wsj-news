    "body": "China’s  Meituan  is raising as much as $10 billion from investors, hoping that it will be able to gain an edge on its e-commerce rivals by spending heavily on technology allowing it to deliver goods using drones and self-driving cars.<br />Meituan is one of China’s most valuable tech companies. Its app lets users order various real-world services including meals and groceries, as well as organizing bookings for hotels, flights, taxis and restaurants.<br />The Hong Kong-listed company is selling as much as $7 billion of stock and $3 billion of convertible bonds, according to a term sheet Monday that was seen by The Wall Street Journal. Meituan declined to comment.<br />The huge capital-raising is considerably bigger than the $4.2 billion Meituan raised in its 2018 initial public offering and suggests there is still a healthy appetite among investors for stock in Chinese technology companies, even though shares in Meituan and many peers have pulled back recently.<br />Earlier this month,  Prosus  NV raised $14.6 billion by selling down a small part of its stake in  Tencent Holdings Ltd. , the internet and videogaming giant."
