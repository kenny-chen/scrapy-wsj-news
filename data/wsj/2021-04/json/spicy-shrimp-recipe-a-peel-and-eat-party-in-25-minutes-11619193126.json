    "body": "JUST BEFORE the pandemic hit, Rashida Holmes launched Bridgetown Roti, an L.A. catering company specializing in Caribbean food made with impeccable produce. When she relaunched with a focus on takeout, her business blew up. “I’ve built this out of the pandemic and it’s been a wild ride,“ she said.<br />Ms. Holmes’s first Slow Food Fast recipe serves up spicy peel-and-eat shrimp with a side of fried plantains, a family favorite from her childhood.<br />An aromatic paste of hot peppers, onions, ginger, garlic and Old Bay infuses the shrimp as it cooks. You want the plantains to be very ripe, even overripe. “They should have at least as many black spots as yellow, otherwise it’s all starch,” said Ms. Holmes. After a quick shallow-fry, toss them in tart Tajín chile-lime seasoning, available in Mexican markets and many supermarkets. (If you don’t find it, simply swap in another brand.)<br />This is a meal you eat with your hands, preferably in the open air, with a cold beer—and plenty of napkins.<br />—Kitty Greenwald is a chef, food writer and the co-author of ‘Slow Fires’ (Clarkson Potter)"
