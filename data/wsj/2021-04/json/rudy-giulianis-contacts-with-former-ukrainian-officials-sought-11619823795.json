    "body": "Manhattan federal prosecutors are seeking to examine Rudy Giuliani’s communications with an array of former Ukrainian officials, people familiar with the matter said, as investigators home in on whether the former Trump lawyer’s push to remove a U.S. diplomat in Kyiv violated foreign lobbying rules.<br />The search warrants executed by federal investigators on Wednesday at Mr. Giuliani’s New York City apartment and office sought evidence related to Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine whom Mr. Giuliani pushed to oust in the spring of 2019, as well as communications with any U.S. government officials or employees regarding the former ambassador or her position, the people said.<br />Former President Donald Trump ordered Ms. Yovanovitch’s removal in the spring of 2019 after an extensive push by Mr. Giuliani, who personally lobbied the president and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.<br />The warrants also sought communications with or regarding associates who worked with Mr. Giuliani to push for Ms. Yovanovitch’s ouster and for an investigation by Ukrainian authorities into the Biden family’s activities in the country, the people familiar with the warrants said. President Biden was at the time considered one of Mr. Trump’s top Democratic rivals.<br />The warrants specifically sought evidence related to former Ukrainian prosecutors general Viktor Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko, former Ukrainian prosecutor Kostiantyn Kulyk and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, the people said."
