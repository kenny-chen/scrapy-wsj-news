    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration will propose an $80 billion funding boost for the Internal Revenue Service over the next decade, aiming to strengthen tax enforcement against the wealthiest Americans, according to two people familiar with the plan.<br />The administration projects that its plan would generate about $700 billion in net taxes that would otherwise go uncollected, the people said. It is an aggressive estimate that relies on more audits, alongside the administration’s proposals to raise tax rates on the ordinary income and capital gains of high-income taxpayers.<br />The proposals are expected to be included in the roughly $1.8 trillion antipoverty proposal that President Biden is expected to detail Wednesday in a speech to Congress. The money from tax enforcement and higher rates would pay for an extension of the expanded child tax credit along with programs to expand child care and funding for community college.<br />Compared with taking the current $12 billion IRS budget and increasing it by 5% annually, the $80 billion addition would increase the agency’s size by more than 50%. In addition to experienced enforcement staff, the IRS has been asking Congress for more money to modernize its computer systems.<br />The IRS plan also is expected to include changes to information-reporting rules that would provide the agency with more data about Americans’ financial activities. When the government has independent information about income—such as W-2 forms with wage data—compliance rates are nearly 100%. Where it doesn’t have such information—much business income—compliance rates are often about half that level."
