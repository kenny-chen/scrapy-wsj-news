    "body": "The NHL has had its share of minor Covid-19 coronavirus clusters and scheduling disruptions this winter. But it’s never seen an outbreak like the one that struck the Vancouver Canucks in recent weeks, in which 24 players and one coach contracted the hyper-contagious Brazilian strain of Covid-19.<br />And this week the most agonizing outbreak in hockey just got longer. The NHL delayed Vancouver’s planned Friday evening return to the ice against Edmonton after players expressed safety concerns about the league’s plan to cram 19 Canucks games into 31 days.<br />“I don’t really feel ready at all,” said Canucks forward J.T. Miller on Wednesday of the plan to resume play after a 23-day hiatus.<br />Playing so many games in such a compressed period would be brutal for even the fittest players, Miller said, nevermind that most of his teammates were coming off serious bouts with the virus. “It’s going to be tough for them [my teammates] to bounce back quickly.”<br />Depending on how the Canucks fare down the stretch—and whether they’re able to climb two spots in the North Division standings—their outbreak may even slightly delay the start of the Stanley Cup playoffs, which are slated to begin on May 16."
