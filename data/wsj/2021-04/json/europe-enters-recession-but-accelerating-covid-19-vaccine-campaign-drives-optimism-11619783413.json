    "body": "Pulika Calzini, co-owner of a trattoria in central Rome, has seen revenues plummet by about 70% since the start of the pandemic, hammered by coronavirus restrictions and Italy’s slow rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.<br />But now, as vaccine campaigns finally gain traction in Italy and elsewhere in the European Union, and Italian authorities gradually reopen the economy, Mr. Calzini is optimistic the worst could be over.<br />“The summer will definitely be better than these last months,” said the 48-year-old.<br />Mr. Calzini’s optimism is widely shared. While fresh data showed the eurozone entered a recession in the first three months of the year—the second recession since the start of the pandemic—a battery of indicators suggest a return to strong growth could already be under way.<br />The EU’s statistics agency on Friday said the eurozone’s gross domestic product was 0.6% lower in the first three months of 2021 than it was in the final quarter of 2020. The currency area has recorded growth in just one of the past five quarters. Output in the first quarter was 1.8% down on a year earlier."
