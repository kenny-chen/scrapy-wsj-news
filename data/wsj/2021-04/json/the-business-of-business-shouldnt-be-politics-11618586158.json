    "body": "Harvey Golub’s “Politics Is Risky Business for CEOs” (op-ed, April 13) is right—on principle and in practice. Taking positions on public policy is not a CEO’s job (unless it affects the business), and it is tricky to execute.<br />At Ogilvy & Mather, we did not accept political clients. First, it is divisive; not everyone would agree with backing that candidate. Second, it is disruptive; political campaigns are work-intensive for short periods and disrupt work for other clients. Third, campaigns are notorious for not paying their bills.<br />But we encouraged our people to engage with politics as citizens. Talented creative directors at our agency, on their own time, created campaigns for Richard Nixon (“Nixon’s the One”) and Ronald Reagan (“It’s Morning Again in America”) as well as Bobby Kennedy. I was a low-level advance man for Hubert Humphrey’s presidential campaign. The principle is the same as that articulated by Mr. Golub: We have obligations as citizens, not as corporations.<br />Kenneth Roman<br />New York"
