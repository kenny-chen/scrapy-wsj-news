    "body": "Regarding Mary Anastasia O’Grady’s “Baseball Says Cuba ‘Sí,’ Georgia ‘No,’ ” Americas, April 12): Antonio Castro, a son of the late dictator Fidel Castro, is the vice president of the Cuban Baseball Federation. Major League baseball was directly involved with him in the negotiations to “garnish [Cuban ballplayers’] salaries and send the dollars back to the dictatorship,” as Ms. O’Grady writes. If not for the prior U.S. administration, MLB would be trafficking Cuban players, who are predominantly black, to enrich a dictatorship whose nomenklatura is predominantly white.<br />The MLB was happy to ignore the murder of young black Cubans by Castro’s police and the silencing of Cubans who speak out. A high-profile example was the extrajudicial killing of a black youth this past summer. Hansel E. Hernández, 27, was shot in the back by police on June 24, 2020. Civil society was silenced when questions were raised, and the dictatorship organized a “heroes of the blue” social-media campaign to promote its officers. Does Major League Baseball wish to continue its collaboration with this racist and repressive police state?<br />John Suarez<br />Center for a Free Cuba<br />Falls Church, Va."
