    "body": "In his April 10 op-ed (“Must the Supreme Court Create a Trustworthy Press?”) Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. criticizes my reporting on Obama and Trump refugee policies but gets his facts wrong. Mr. Jenkins argues that, in comparing the Trump and Obama records on refugee admissions, I should have used the 2019 figures to avoid any distortion due to the pandemic. That year, he claims, the Trump administration admitted 92,623 refugees, “a number the Obama team never approached in its best year.”<br />In fact, the Trump administration admitted only 29,916 refugees in 2019, barely half the number the Obama administration admitted in 2011, the year of fewest admissions under President Obama.<br />Mr. Jenkins arrives at his numbers by conflating admitted refugees with those asylum applicants who were found to have a credible fear of persecution. Asylum is granted to people who present themselves at a U.S. border or are already in the country. Under U.S. and international law, the U.S. is legally obligated to grant asylum if an individual is found to have a “well-founded fear of persecution.” Refugees constitute an entirely separate category. They apply for protection while they are still outside the U.S. and are granted admission only at the discretion of the U.S. government. Those who are selected for admission to the U.S. get resettled and are given legal residence through a formal program overseen by the State Department. President Trump repeatedly made clear his displeasure with the refugee resettlement program and drastically lowered the refugee admission ceilings during his years in office.<br />It is true that refugee admissions in 2020 were depressed further as a result of the pandemic, but the record of sharply reduced admissions over Mr. Trump’s entire term is beyond dispute.<br />Tom Gjelten"
