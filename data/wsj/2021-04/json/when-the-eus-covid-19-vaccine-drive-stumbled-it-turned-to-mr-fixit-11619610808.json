    "body": "Thierry Breton knew the European Union’s vaccine campaign needed help when his boss called him in January.<br />Covid-19 cases were surging and EU deaths linked to the coronavirus had topped 400,000. The bloc lagged behind weeks behind the U.S. and U.K. in approving vaccines and even further behind in inoculating people. Then  Pfizer Inc.  and  AstraZeneca  PLC stunned EU officials by saying deliveries would arrive late.<br />European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen summoned Mr. Breton to join an emergency videoconference with top pharmaceutical executives and then other calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.<br />Over the previous year, Mr. Breton had become the bloc’s Mr. Fixit, spearheading efforts to boost supplies of masks and ventilators when the pandemic first hit. Enlisting him on the vaccine calls meant plans to inoculate the bloc’s 450 million people were already stumbling.<br />“It’s the same thing all over again,” an aide told Mr. Breton."
