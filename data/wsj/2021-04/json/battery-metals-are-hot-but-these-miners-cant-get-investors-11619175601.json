But many small mining companies that supply the raw materials haven’t been invited to the party.<br />Uncertainty over the metals’ quality, the short- and long-term outlook for prices and the ability of North American miners to compete with their Chinese counterparts is making investors wary.<br />Bryce Crocker, the chief executive officer of Jervois Mining Ltd., is touting a cobalt project in Idaho. The Australian executive needs $100 million to open a mine on central Idaho’s Gant Mountain that the company says could eventually produce more than 15% of the cobalt consumed annually in the U.S. The blue-gray mineral is critical to making the batteries that power electric vehicles, laptops and smartphones as well as the alloys used to make jet-fighter engines.<br />After more than a year of fundraising, he is still seeking contributions from commercial banks, private-equity firms and hedge funds.<br />“We need the support of the capital markets,” he said. “But this is not a commodity that lenders have traditionally loaned against.”"
