    "body": "Sunday’s Academy Awards came after nearly 14 months in which most people haven’t gone to a movie theater. But only one star at the scaled down ceremony at a Los Angeles train station mentioned the industry’s biggest challenge.<br />“Please watch our movie on the largest screen possible,” Frances McDormand said after “Nomadland” won best picture, “and one day soon take everyone you know into a theater, shoulder-to-shoulder in that dark space, and watch every film that is represented here tonight.”<br />This is a make-or-break moment for movie theaters. Box office receipts plummeted 72% world-wide and 80% in the U.S. last year, according to the Motion Picture Association trade group. AMC Entertainment Inc., the world’s biggest theater chain, almost went bankrupt. And many small theaters without AMC’s resources have teetered on the edge of survival or shut down entirely, including Los Angeles’ beloved ArcLight Cinemas.<br />As theaters re-open this year nobody is sure whether audiences will go as frequently as they did a year-and-a-half ago, or whether many will prefer to keep streaming at home.<br />Ms. McDormand’s message was addressed to a televised audience that was the smallest in Oscars history, but still the biggest collective moment for people who care about film."
