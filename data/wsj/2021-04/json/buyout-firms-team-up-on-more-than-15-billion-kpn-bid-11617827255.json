    "body": "A pair of private-equity firms have teamed up to make a bid for  Royal KPN  NV that could value the Dutch communications-services provider at more than $15 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />New York-based Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners and Sweden’s  EQT  AB are working on a bid that could be valued at more than €3 a share,  equivalent to $3.56, some of the people said. KPN shares closed Wednesday at €2.88 in European trading. The funds are preparing to conduct due diligence with the goal of submitting a formal bid this spring. It is possible that they could take on another partner and that they will face competition, these people said.<br />There are no guarantees that the parties will follow through, and if they do, that they will reach an agreement. Adding a layer of complication, the Dutch government would need to sign off on any deal.<br />KPN is the largest telecommunications operator in the Netherlands, offering mobile-telephony, data and television services to customers across the country. KPN’s business also includes a wholesale operation that leases fixed and mobile networks to other carriers that don’t operate their own networks.<br />Bloomberg in November reported that EQT had made an approach to KPN."
