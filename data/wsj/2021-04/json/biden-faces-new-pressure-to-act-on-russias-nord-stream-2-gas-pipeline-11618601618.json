    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden is facing growing pressure from Congress as his administration wrestles with whether to use U.S. sanctions powers against Nord Stream 2, a Russian natural-gas pipeline project to Europe.<br />Mr. Biden opposes the pipeline, which would circumvent supply lines that run through Ukraine to transport Russian natural gas to U.S. ally Germany, undermining Ukraine and strengthening Russia’s grip on the European energy market. The project, however, was conspicuously left out of a series of sanctions and other punitive measures against Moscow announced Thursday.<br />The Biden administration has prepared sanctions packages against the project, which are under consideration and include some of the most aggressive approaches yet to kill the pipeline, but hasn’t decided to impose them, according to current and former State Department officials.<br />These include measures to target Nord Stream 2 AG, the Swiss-registered Russian firm behind the project, and its chief executive officer, Matthias Warnig, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with other entities and ships involved in the project, the officials said.<br />The State Department said it doesn’t preview sanctions."
