    "body": "WASHINGTON—The National Institutes of Health said Friday it would generally allow use of human fetal tissue in federally funded medical research, reversing a Trump administration policy aimed at curtailing that practice.<br />Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra determined there were “no new ethical issues that require special review,” according to a statement from the NIH.<br />In 2019, the Trump administration moved to limit federal funding for research involving fetal tissue, mandating that applications for funding for such research in the U.S. had to be approved by an ethics advisory board.<br />Under Mr. Becerra, the NIH will no longer require an ethics review, though the precise scope of the decision wasn’t immediately detailed. More than 20 members of Congress who had written to the secretary applauded the new decision, saying the restrictions were “politically motivated and unnecessary.”<br />Medical research employing fetal tissue has led to medical progress such as the development of vaccines for rubella and rabies, but such scientific work has long been opposed by leading figures in the antiabortion movement."
