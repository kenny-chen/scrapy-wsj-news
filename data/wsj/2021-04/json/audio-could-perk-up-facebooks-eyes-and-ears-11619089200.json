The hope is that you’ll spend a lot of yours in return.<br />Fringe social audio network Clubhouse has just 35 employees and, in the span of less than three months this year, has grown its valuation from $1 to a whopping $4 billion, according to PitchBook. So when it comes to audio, imagine what a company with more than 58,000 employees and nearly half the world’s population already using its existing platforms can do.<br />Facebook wants to find out, of course. On Monday, the social-media giant said it would launch a series of new audio features, including a Clubhouse competitor in Live Audio Rooms that should be available to everyone on the Facebook app by the summer.<br />Facebook says it will test its audio rooms in Groups, where the company hopes it will be able to do audibly what Groups did for its platform visually: Bring together a concentrated group of people with similar interests. Facebook says it has 1.8 billion people using Groups every month—64% of the total monthly users on its legacy Blue app.<br />In theory, audio networks could be even more popular. Years ago, texting became the new phone call, offering the ability to multitask. But we appear to be coming full circle with the proliferation of audio apps as a potential next frontier of social media that can be consumed anywhere, anytime, from a street corner to your kitchen."
