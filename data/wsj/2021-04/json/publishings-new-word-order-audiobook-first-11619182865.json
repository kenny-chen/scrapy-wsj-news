    "body": "Malcolm Gladwell’s latest book opens with ominous sirens, planes droning overhead and a powerful explosion.<br />Unlike most audiobooks, which are offshoots of a traditional text manuscript, “The Bomber Mafia,” was conceived first as an audio project. Only later, after there was a completed script, was it offered to a major publisher. The print and ebook versions, as well as the audiobook, go on sale April 27.<br />“The Bomber Mafia” is part of an effort by Pushkin Industries Inc., an audio company that Mr. Gladwell co-founded, to become a major provider of highly produced “original” audiobooks. Such projects sound more like podcasts than traditional audiobooks, since they often feature original scores, as well as archival and interview tape.<br />Industry giants including Bertelsmann SE’s Penguin Random House and  Amazon.com Inc.’s  Audible also produce high-production original audiobooks with sound effects and a cast of multiple actors, representing significant competition for Pushkin.<br />As a writer, Mr. Gladwell has been a star on the pop-culture circuit for more than two decades, thanks to such bestsellers as “The Tipping Point,” “Blink” and “Outliers.” His ability to look at popular subjects in fresh and unexpected ways has made him an arbiter of human behavior and social phenomena."
