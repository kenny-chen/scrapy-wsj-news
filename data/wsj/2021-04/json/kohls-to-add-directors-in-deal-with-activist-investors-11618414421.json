The activists had launched a public campaign earlier this year seeking to replace nine of the then 12 board members and calling for other strategic changes.<br />The new directors include former restaurant and retail executives Margaret Jenkins and Thomas Kingsbury. Kohl’s is also adding an independent director that it identified and who received the blessing of the investor group: Christine Day, the former chief executive of Lululemon Athletica Inc.<br />Kohl’s CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement that she looked forward to working with the newly expanded board. The investor group said it was pleased to have reached a resolution with the company and added that the new directors, all retail leaders, will add valuable expertise to the board.<br />Kohl’s said two directors will retire from the board. Steve Burd will step down at the end of August, while Frank Sica will retire next year at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. The three new directors will be installed at the annual meeting next month."
