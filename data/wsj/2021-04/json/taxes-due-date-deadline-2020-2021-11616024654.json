    "body": "The Internal Revenue Service has delayed the tax filing and payment deadline for individuals to May 17 from April 15 for 2020 tax returns. However, the extension doesn’t apply to the deadline for estimated tax payments due for the first quarter of 2021. They are still due on April 15, a deadline IRS Commissioner affirmed in Senate testimony on April 13.<br />The postponement responded to concerns raised by lawmakers and tax professionals that Americans need more time to file and pay taxes this year because of the coronavirus pandemic and recent legislation responding to it.<br />Last year, the pandemic prompted the agency to postpone the April 15 deadline to July 15 for a range of tax filings, but this year’s relief is narrower.<br />More than 30 states and the District of Columbia have also delayed the state-tax filing deadline to May 17, according to the American Institute of CPAs.<br />Here are answers to questions taxpayers are asking."
