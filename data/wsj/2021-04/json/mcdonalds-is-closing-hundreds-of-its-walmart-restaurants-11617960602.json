The retailer delivered a steady stream of diners, and the eateries provided rental profits and a reason for shoppers to stick around stores.<br />Those bonds have frayed as more shopping goes online and fast-food restaurants depend more on drive-through windows for sales, a feature Walmart locations don’t have.
