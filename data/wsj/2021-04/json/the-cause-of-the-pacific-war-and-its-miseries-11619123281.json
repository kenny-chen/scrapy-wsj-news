    "body": "When watching grainy newsreels of World War II or walking through seemingly endless rows of white marble crosses in a military cemetery, one has to wonder: How did such a large number of people in their prime end up trapped in sinking ships, face down in the brine, or scattered on the beaches of the Pacific? How did all these fallen soldiers get corralled into the hecatombs of history?<br />Sean McMeekin’s “The Other Day of Infamy in 1941” (op-ed, April 13) helps to answer this question. It can begin with some minion such as Treasury Secretary Harry Dexter White enlisting in Stalin’s Operation Snow and crafting the “Hull note.” One insulting letter lights the fuse and then ships full of men sink, battalions rush into machine-gun fire and atomic bombs roast cities. The destruction and carnage stemming from scraps of paper, hosting the likes of the Hull note, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the Molotov-Matsuoka Pact, demonstrate the volatility of civilization itself.<br />Lt. Cmdr. Jeffrey R. Smith, USN (Ret.)<br />Alameda, Calif.<br />"
