    "body": "HONG KONG—China’s antitrust watchdog is beefing up its senior ranks as authorities step up efforts to rein in the country’s powerful technology companies.<br />Dong Hongxia will take on a new role as a third deputy director-general of the Antimonopoly Bureau, part of the powerful State Administration for Market Regulation, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Dong, currently director of a division responsible for reviewing mergers, is an expert on antitrust issues and a frequent speaker at seminars and events.<br />The appointment, expected to take effect in the coming months, would mark the first time that the bureau has three deputy director-generals at once—a reflection of the agency’s growing clout, the people said.<br />Several low-to-mid-level officials will be added to the bureau’s merger-review divisions as it expands its reach and resources in the widening antitrust crackdown, these people said.<br />The market regulator didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment."
