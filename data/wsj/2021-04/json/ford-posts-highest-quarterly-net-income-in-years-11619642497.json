    "body": "Ford Motor Co.  posted $3.3 billion in net income—its highest quarterly result in years—but warned the financial toll from the continuing global computer-chip shortage will likely worsen.<br />Ford’s bottom line, which was fueled by strong pricing in North America, reversed a $2 billion loss from a year earlier, when the Covid-19 pandemic froze North American production.<br />The company posted pretax first-quarter profit excluding one-time items of $4.8 billion, or 89 cents a share, easily surpassing the 22 cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet. Revenue rose 6% to $36.2 billion.<br />Ford said the chip shortage will cut $2.5 billion from adjusted pretax profit this year, the high range of the $1 billion-to-$2.5-billion estimate it provided in February. The company said the lack of semiconductors will force it to cut second-quarter production in half, but it expects the situation to improve after June.<br />Ford finance chief John Lawler said a fire at a semiconductor supplier in Japan in March exacerbated a chip shortfall that had already hit auto makers hard at the start of the year."
