    "body": "INDIANAPOLIS—Vigils sprung up across the city Saturday for the eight victims of a mass shooting, as law-enforcement officials in the city continued to investigate the shooter’s motives.<br />Brandon Hole, a 19-year-old former employee of  FedEx Corp. , killed eight people and wounded several others before taking his own life at the company’s ground facility here Thursday night, police said. Mr. Hole had been temporarily committed last year for mental-health problems, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation also confiscated a gun from him last year, authorities said.<br />Late Friday, police identified those who died in the shooting: Matthew Alexander, 32 years old; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Kaur Johal, 66; Jasvinder Kaur, 50; Sardar Jaswinder Singh, 68; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74.<br />Among those killed were four members of the Sikh community. The Sikh Coalition, a national advocacy group, said it was in touch with law-enforcement and government officials, pushing for a thorough investigation into the shooter’s motive and changes that would protect minority communities.<br />As with the shootings last month in Atlanta—in which six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent—the preponderance of Sikh victims in Thursday’s shooting raised questions about whether the attack was motivated by ethnic or religious animus."
