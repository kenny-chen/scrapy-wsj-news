    "body": "As Republican donors gather this weekend for a retreat in Palm Beach, Fla., a crop of potential 2024 presidential contenders will get a chance to court party bigwigs. One expected to draw particular attention is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.<br />Mr. DeSantis has burnished his brand with a Covid-19 response that has enthused the voter base of former President Donald Trump while—in Florida, at least—also impressing the kind of moderate and suburban voters who turned away from Mr. Trump in 2020.<br />As the GOP looks to rebuild after losing the presidential election last year, that formula could give Mr. DeSantis an advantage over rivals who similarly are trying to forge their own path in the shadow of Mr. Trump, some analysts said.<br />Over the past year, Mr. DeSantis rejected the advice of most public-health experts and reopened the state’s economy early, resisted mask mandates and other restrictions, and made Florida one of the most permissive settings in the U.S. He received praise from Republicans and scathing criticism from Democrats while sparring regularly with the media—a practice that endeared him to fans and allies of Mr. Trump. Some decisions, such as requiring schools to offer in-person instruction starting last fall, proved popular across a wide political spectrum.<br />“We are an oasis of freedom in a nation that’s suffering in many parts of the country under the yoke of oppressive lockdowns,” Mr. DeSantis said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando in February. “Florida got it right, and the lockdown states got it wrong.”"
