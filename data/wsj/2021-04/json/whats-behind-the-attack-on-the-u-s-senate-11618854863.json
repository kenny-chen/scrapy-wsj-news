    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Targeting the U.S. Senate” (April 12): The most storied deliberative body on earth is now under siege from myopic politicians who want to use polarization as a pretext to steamroll the opposition. Those in favor of nuking the filibuster seem to misidentify it as the main culprit of legislative paralysis rather than looking at political division itself. They appear convinced they have garnered a strong mandate from voters to enact transformative policies. This will not end well.<br />In this political climate, a House-like majoritarian Senate guarantees a tectonic change of policy direction once power shifts. And a policy pendulum swinging too hard is sure to dent both parties and the country.<br />Cheney Wen<br />Taipei<br />"
