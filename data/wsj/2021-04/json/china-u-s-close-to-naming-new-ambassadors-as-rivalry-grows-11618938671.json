    "body": "China and the U.S. are getting close to naming new envoys to both capitals as the two world powers get locked into an increasingly heated competition for global leadership.<br />Beijing plans to appoint Qin Gang, an adept diplomat who has acted as President Xi Jinping’s chief protocol officer, as the next ambassador to Washington, according to officials with knowledge of the matter.<br />Washington is widely expected to name R. Nicholas Burns, a veteran diplomat who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, as its ambassador to Beijing, say people familiar with the administration’s decision making.<br />The expected appointments come at a time when the bilateral relationship has continued to fray after having plummeted during the Trump administration. President Biden has been trying to build alliances to confront a more self-confident and assertive China, while Mr. Xi is intent on reshaping the relationship as one between two head-on competitors.<br />The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn’t respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for the State Department and the White House declined to comment. Mr. Burns didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
