    "body": "Blackstone Group Inc.  swung to a record quarterly profit as its focus on fast-growing companies helped the value of its investments climb more than the broader market.<br />The investment giant posted net income of $1.75 billion, or $2.46 a share, for the first quarter. That compares with a loss of $1.07 billion, or $1.58 a share, in the coronavirus-battered first quarter of 2020.<br />The value of Blackstone’s private-equity portfolio climbed by 15.3% in the latest period, far exceeding the 5.8% gain for the S&P 500. The firm’s recent emphasis on growth companies, including online-dating platform  Bumble Inc.  and genealogy company Ancestry.com Inc., propelled the gains, Blackstone President Jonathan Gray said in an interview.<br />The growth orientation, a product of Mr. Gray’s push to encourage his firm’s business heads to identify global trends and invest in companies that stand to benefit from them, has led Blackstone to put more money into areas such as logistics, business software, digital payments and life sciences—industries that performed well during the pandemic.<br />“We feel as good about the business as we’ve ever felt in terms of the performance of the business and the response from our customers,” Mr. Gray said."
