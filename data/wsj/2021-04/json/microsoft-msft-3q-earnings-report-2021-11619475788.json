    "body": "Microsoft Corp.  is expected to continue its pandemic-fueled run of strong quarterly earnings that have bolstered investor enthusiasm in the software giant, bringing the company near a $2 trillion valuation.<br />Microsoft has seen massive growth across its professional and consumer businesses with people stuck at home and remote work and distance education becoming the norm for many. That has driven rapid uptake of its cloud-computing services and supercharged the company’s videogaming sales. Microsoft’s stock is up around 50% over the past year, driving the company’s valuation to about $1.97 trillion, second only to  Apple Inc.<br />Wall Street on average expects the Redmond, Wash., company to post a roughly 17% increase in its fiscal third-quarter sales to about $41 billion after the bell on Tuesday, generating net income of $13.6 billion for the January through March period, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.<br />“Microsoft continues to benefit from a Covid-19-led acceleration in cloud migration and strong demand for workforce modernization,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Michael Turits said in a note.<br />Strong demand for cloud services late last year helped Microsoft reverse a trend of a gradually declining pace of growth as the business gained scale. The company said sales linked to Azure cloud services advanced 50% in the December quarter, up from 48% in the prior three-month period. Azure, the collection of a global network of data centers and software tools Microsoft sells as a service, last year became a larger revenue source for the company than its Windows operating system, Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin has said. Microsoft is No. 2 in the cloud behind  Amazon.com Inc."
