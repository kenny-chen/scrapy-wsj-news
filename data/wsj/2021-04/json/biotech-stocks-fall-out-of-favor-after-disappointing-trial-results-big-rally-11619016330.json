    "body": "Biotech shares have slumped in recent months, stung by setbacks in clinical trials and a rotation away from growth stocks after a steep rally in 2020.<br />The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has fallen 10% from its Feb. 8 record, lagging behind the S&P 500, which has gained 6.6%, and the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite, which has slipped 0.3%, over that period. The decline has left the biotech index up 2.2% for the year, compared with respective gains of 11% and 8.2% for the other two indexes.<br />The disparity illustrates the heightened riskiness of biotech investing, where clinical trials and regulatory decisions can make or break a company’s value. Investors in biotech stocks are enticed by the potential for handsome gains that can follow scientific breakthroughs. But that prospect is often accompanied by stock-price volatility, since new treatments have no promise of success. Shifts in the economic outlook can also affect perceptions of the group.<br />Shares of  Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.,   Amicus Therapeutics Inc.  and  Frequency Therapeutics Inc.  are among the recent losers for biotech investors, having lost more than half their value so far this year.<br />“It’s felt like a kitchen sink in terms of the number of factors weighing on biotech sentiment in the near term,” said Andy Acker, who manages the Janus Henderson Global Life Sciences Fund. Among those are disappointing clinical trials, concern about the possibility of renewed focus on drug prices in Washington and the recent rotation into economically sensitive stocks."
