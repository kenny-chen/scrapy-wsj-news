    "body": "The U.S. government plans to share as many as 60 million doses of the  AstraZeneca  Covid-19 vaccine with the rest of the world, the White House said Monday.<br />“The administration is looking at options to share American-made AstraZeneca vaccine doses during the next few months,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, adding that the U.S. was confident in its supply of other available vaccines. “Given AstraZeneca is not authorized for use in the United States, we do not need to use AstraZeneca in our fight against Covid over the next few months.”<br />Ms. Psaki said the Food and Drug Administration would confirm that all AstraZeneca doses meet safety expectations before they are shipped from the U.S.<br />The Biden administration has faced growing pressure to share vaccine doses with developing countries and other nations that have been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic. A surge in India, which for the fifth consecutive day set a record for the world’s largest single-day increase in new cases, prompted calls for the U.S. to share its AstraZeneca supply with the Indian government as the latter struggles to vaccinate its population.<br />AstraZeneca declined to comment on whether it was consulted on the decision. “The doses are part of AstraZeneca’s supply commitments to the U.S. government,” a spokeswoman for AstraZeneca said in an email. “Decisions to send U.S. supply to other countries are made by the U.S. government.”"
