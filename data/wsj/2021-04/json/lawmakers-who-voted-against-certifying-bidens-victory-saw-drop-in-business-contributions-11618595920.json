    "body": "WASHINGTON—Republican members of Congress who voted against certifying President Biden’s victory after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot saw a sharp drop in donations from business and industry political-action committees in the first quarter of this year, new federal filings show.<br />PACs for companies, trade associations, unions, cooperatives and membership groups gave $1.3 million in the first quarter of the year to the campaigns of the 147 Republican election objectors, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of quarterly reports filed by Thursday’s deadline.<br />That was down about 80% from $6.7 million donated by such groups to the lawmakers in the first quarter in 2019, a comparable period in the last election cycle, the Journal found.<br />PAC campaign donations to Republican and Democratic lawmakers who voted to certify the election were also down but not as sharply, falling 35% from $27.2 million to $17.7 million, records show. Democratic members saw a 30% decline in such donations.<br />While the first quarter after a national election is often a slow period for donations, the new data indicates that most companies and trade groups that said they would suspend contributions pending a review after the Capitol riot have done so."
