    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Derek Chauvin murder trial has reinvigorated efforts on Capitol Hill to address police misconduct, with the White House and lawmakers seeing new energy for bipartisan talks despite different stances on legal protections for officers.<br />After Mr. Chauvin was found guilty Tuesday of murdering George Floyd, President Biden promised the Floyd family he would sign a police-overhaul bill. “We’re going to do a lot, we’re going to stay at it until we get it done,” Mr. Biden told the family in a phone call.<br />Lawmakers of both parties are expressing hopes they can bridge gaps that derailed efforts last year, when both Republicans and Democrats drew up competing overhaul plans but failed to reach agreement as protests over police killings swept the nation. Talks are being led by Rep. Karen Bass (D., Calif.) and Sens. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) and Tim Scott (R., S.C.).<br />In March, the Democratic-controlled House again passed its bill, the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act, but it doesn’t have enough support in the Senate to advance. The legislation, among other steps, would reduce funding for state and local police departments that don’t ban chokeholds and create a public database of shared disciplinary records.<br />A rival GOP proposal from last year would collect more data around police practices, establish new training programs and widen the use of body cameras, among other proposals."
