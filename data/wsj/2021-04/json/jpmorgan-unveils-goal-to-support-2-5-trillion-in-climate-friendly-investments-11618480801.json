    "body": "JPMorgan Chase  & Co. is pledging to facilitate $2.5 trillion worth of climate-conscious transactions over the next decade.<br />The bank, the U.S.’s largest by assets, said it would deploy its own capital and offer its expertise to help clients and customers to “accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.”<br />It is unclear how much of the $2.5 trillion will come from JPMorgan itself. All relevant transactions the bank finances, structures or otherwise facilitates will count toward the target, the bank said.<br />Climate activists and the bank’s own investors have for years called on it to use its lending power to protect the environment. JPMorgan had some $40 billion in lending exposure to oil-and-gas companies last year, and the Rainforest Action Network considers it the world’s biggest financier of fossil fuels.<br />JPMorgan expects more than $1 trillion of the commitment to go toward projects that support green energy, including wind and solar. The bank financed or facilitated more than $55 billion worth of green energy projects in 2020."
