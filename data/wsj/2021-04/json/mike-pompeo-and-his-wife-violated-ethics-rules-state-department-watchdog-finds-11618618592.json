    "body": "Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his wife violated ethics rules by asking department employees to carry out tasks of a personal nature, including pet care, a report released Friday by the State Department’s internal watchdog said.<br />The report by the State Department’s Office of Inspector General details a range of complaints made by State Department employees. The OIG says it found evidence that Susan Pompeo, Mr. Pompeo’s wife, allegedly tasked a senior adviser to the former secretary with purchasing or delivering personal items, ranging from flowers for friends, photograph prints, magazines for Mr. Pompeo’s family, and T-shirts for a friend in Ukraine.<br />The watchdog says requests exceeded ethical boundaries with regard to some State Department staff. The report, however, didn’t find that the couple exceeded ethical boundaries with the special agents protecting them.<br />“At no time did I, or my wife Susan, misuse taxpayer money or violate rules or ethical norms,” Mr. Pompeo said. “Our actions were constantly reviewed by dozens of lawyers, and we made massive efforts, and did, comply with every requirement.”<br />“This latest IG report is yet another attempt to slander me and worse, my wife by our own government,” the former secretary added."
