    "body": "It is shaping up to be a stellar earnings season for stocks, particularly cyclical ones like banks and retailers. The problem is that the market may already be moving on.<br />Because the U.S. economy is emerging from the Covid-19 crisis, most analysts thought first-quarter numbers would be good. So far, they have been much better than good: By the end of Friday, S&P 500 companies that had already reported had beaten profit expectations by a combined 30%, according to FactSet, compared with a five-year average of 7%.<br />Were the earnings season to maintain this trend, it would be the highest number on record. The largest surprises have come from Wall Street’s big banks, which are the first blue chips to report— Morgan Stanley  shrugged off a $911 million loss from the Archegos implosion—as well as consumer-goods firms like  Lennar .<br />Optimism is reinforced by the latest economic data. In the U.S., retail sales for March were the strongest in 10 months. Even in Europe, where there has been less fiscal support for the economy, figures are coming in strong. This bodes well for the earnings season there as well.<br />But something strange is happening: While stocks are up across the board, those sectors beating expectations the most aren’t doing particularly well. The most glaring example is the KBW Bank Index, which actually fell last week."
