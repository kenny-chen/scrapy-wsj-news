    "body": "“Nomadland” won the award for best picture Sunday at the 93rd Academy Awards, where Hollywood tried to make a case for the power of movies and turn a corner after 14 months of existential crisis for the industry.<br />“Please watch our movie on the largest screen possible,” said Frances McDormand, a producer of “Nomadland” and its star, in her acceptance speech, urging viewers to return to movie theaters “shoulder to shoulder in that dark space.”<br />With its vistas of the American West, “Nomadland” was a counterpoint to the cooped-up reality for many viewers in pandemic, and offered a somber tale of resilience, with a character learning to live on society’s margins, played by Ms. McDormand, who also won the Oscar for best actress.<br /><br />The film’s director, Chloé Zhao, became only the second woman (after Kathryn Bigelow) to win the Academy Award for best director. The Beijing-born Ms. Zhao is also the first Asian woman to win that award."
