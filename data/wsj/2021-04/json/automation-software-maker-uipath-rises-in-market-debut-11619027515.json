    "body": "Shares of UiPath Inc. rose 23% in their market debut, giving the company that helps other businesses automate repetitive tasks a valuation of roughly $36 billion.<br />Shares closed Wednesday at $69, above the initial public offering price of $56.<br />UiPath, founded in Romania in 2005 and now based in New York City, is one of several companies that bets on RPA, short for robotic process automation, and other automation solutions as a ticket to efficiency.<br />The idea is that a digital army of “bots” handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks at a fraction of the time and cost, allowing companies to connect different systems and freeing employees—and resources—to do more meaningful, strategic work.<br />Companies have increasingly digitized operations, but in silos, said lead director Rich Wong, a partner at Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Accel, an early investor in UiPath. The real efficiency, he said, comes from companies being able to connect those digital islands."
