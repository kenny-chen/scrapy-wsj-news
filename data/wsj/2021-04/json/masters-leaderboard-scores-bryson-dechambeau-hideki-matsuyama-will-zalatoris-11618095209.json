    "body": "AUGUSTA, Ga.—Bryson DeChambeau walked off the fifth green at this Masters on Saturday muttering to nobody in particular about how he had played the fourth and fifth holes this week.<br />“Seven freaking over,” he grumbled.<br />His mood didn’t get much better over the next two holes. On the par-3 sixth, an enormous cheer came out for the other player in his grouping, Matt Jones, who barely missed a hole-in-one. Then, with DeChambeau on the seventh tee box, he was interrupted by an even bigger cheer—Corey Conners actually aced the sixth right behind him.<br />That’s how it’s been here for Bryson DeChambeau. Golf’s biggest hitter, and the sport’s most intriguing player to many, just can’t solve the course he wants to figure out more than any other.<br />“I don’t think you can ever figure this place out,” DeChambeau said this week."
