    "body": "Vaccinated shoppers are heading back to the mall, offering hope that the worst of the pandemic downturn is over for this beleaguered industry.<br />Foot traffic at a representative sample of 50 malls in March was up 86% from the same month last year, according to mobile-device location data from analytics firm Placer.ai.<br />While that foot traffic was 24% lower than in March 2019, mall owners are suggesting that their business has turned a corner. Shoppers are eager to get out again, often armed with cash from the latest round of government stimulus checks. Many aren’t just browsing shops but dining out and returning home with bags full of new purchases.<br />“There’s no question things are better. Sales are also better than anticipated four months ago,” said Bill Taubman, president and chief operating officer of Taubman Co.<br />Shares of  Simon Property Group Inc.,  which recently acquired Taubman, are up 45% this year. That is more than three times the gain this year in the S&P 500."
