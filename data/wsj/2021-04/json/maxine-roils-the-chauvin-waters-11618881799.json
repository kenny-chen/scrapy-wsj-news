    "body": "Well, this certainly is a mess, and let’s hope it doesn’t turn tragic. Maxine Waters, the House Financial Services Committee chair, might have poisoned the Derek Chauvin trial now reaching its conclusion in Minneapolis.<br />That’s the view expressed Monday by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who is presiding over the prosecution of Mr. Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd last May. Defense attorney Eric Nelson urged Judge Cahill to declare a mistrial after Ms. Waters made incendiary remarks to a crowd of protesters in Brooklyn Center near Minneapolis on the weekend.<br />Judge Cahill denied the request but said, “I’ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.”<br />The judge added that “I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function.” He’s right in his wish, and he could be right about an appeal depending on how the jury rules in the case.<br />Ms. Waters tried to rile up the crowd to protest an acquittal. “I hope we get a verdict that says guilty, guilty, guilty,” she said. “And if we don’t, we cannot go away. We’ve got to stay on the street. . . . We get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational.”"
