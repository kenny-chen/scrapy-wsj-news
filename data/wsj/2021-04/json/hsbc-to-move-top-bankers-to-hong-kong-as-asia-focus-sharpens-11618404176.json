    "body": "Global banking giant  HSBC Holdings  PLC will move four senior bankers from London to Hong Kong to boost its strategy of refocusing operations on Asia instead of Europe and North America.<br />The executives who will move later this year are Barry O’Byrne, head of global commercial banking; Greg Guyett, co-head of global banking and markets; Nuno Matos, head of wealth and personal banking, and Nicolas Moreau, head of global asset management, HSBC said in notes to staff.<br />“I want more of our global executive team to be located in key growth regions,” HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn wrote in one of the notes.<br />HSBC, which was founded in Hong Kong in 1865, has been caught up in the geopolitical tension between China and the West over the weakening autonomy of the Asian port city from Beijing. Some U.S. and British politicians have urged the bank to take a stance against China but Mr. Quinn has declined to do so, stating that he is a banker, not a politician.<br />Mr. Quinn assured colleagues in his note that HSBC will continue to be based in London and maintain a global presence."
