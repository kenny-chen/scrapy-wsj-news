    "body": "<br /><br /><br />New York<br />The opening gallery of the Museum of Modern Art’s “Alexander Calder: Modern From the Start,” which hosts a modest, black-and-white installation of seven abstractions, is absolutely stunning. Playful, muscular, fantastical and serene, it’s among the most striking gatherings of Calder’s art I have ever seen."
