    "body": "<br /><br />To run into an acquaintance out of context can be a jarring experience. Recognition is fuzzy, name and story slow to focus. On the other hand, to see a familiar painting in a different context can be an enriching experience. That is certainly the case with Giovanni Bellini’s “St. Francis in the Desert,” which has migrated five blocks north, from the familiar cozy environs of the Frick mansion to Marcel Breuer’s stacked-box, Brutalist building on Madison Avenue.<br />In the hushed intimacy of Frick’s sitting room, one craned to see Bellini’s picture hung over stuffed furniture and plush carpets, accompanied by an array of masterworks by Titian, Holbein and El Greco. It was much like seeing the picture in a Venetian palace on the Grand Canal.<br />At the Frick Madison, the Bellini has a room and a window all to itself. With the picture hung waist high, nothing prevents the viewer from becoming wholly absorbed in it. Soon, one begins meandering far into a bucolic landscape with much to see and discover."
