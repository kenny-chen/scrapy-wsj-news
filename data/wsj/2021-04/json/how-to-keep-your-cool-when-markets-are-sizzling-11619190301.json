    "body": "Buy low, sell high.<br />Is any investing advice more universal—or more universally ignored?<br />That market axiom was made for times like these, when stocks are hovering near all-time highs, digital currencies are heading to the moon and commodity prices are surging. Yet, when markets seem to be breaking records every day, your emotions naturally prompt you to buy high, not to sell.<br />Even the world’s greatest investors find selling harder than buying. Peter Lynch, former manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund, has said his “greatest mistakes” were selling at the wrong time.<br />That’s largely because of the unbearable feeling of FOMO, fear of missing out. Sell a winner too soon, and you have to watch from the sidelines as it continues to soar. The most you could have lost from keeping it is 100%, but the gains you can miss out on by selling too soon are unlimited."
