    "body": "Princeton University is ramping up its effort to increase enrollment of first-generation and low-income students and ease their path to graduation, backed by a $20 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br />On Monday the school is announcing a new center, focused on improving access and opportunities for such students. It will house a range of existing programs like targeted summer orientation, mentoring, social activities and workshops on topics like choosing a major and translating professors’ jargon.<br />The center will also serve as a base for research to determine the most effective support mechanisms for first-generation and low-income students and how they can be used by colleges nationwide.<br />The goal is to share findings with other universities to scale up a range of efforts that can help get underrepresented students “to, through and beyond the university,” said Khristina Gonzalez, an associate dean and the director of programs for access and inclusion at Princeton. She will head up the new Emma Bloomberg Center for Access and Opportunity.<br />Ms. Bloomberg, daughter of the billionaire businessman and philanthropist Michael Bloomberg, is a 2001 Princeton graduate."
