    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department appointed a senior official on Monday to a new post coordinating wide-ranging efforts to fight climate change through economic and tax policies.<br />John E. Morton, a former adviser to the Obama administration, will lead a newly formed climate hub, the Treasury said. He will report directly to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and focus on financing for investments needed to reduce carbon emissions.<br />The move is part of the Biden administration’s effort to address climate change and its impact on various industries. Gary Gensler, the newly confirmed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is expected to require more disclosure from public companies on the potential impact of climate change on their businesses.<br />The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve have said they want to better understand risks to financial stability and the economy emanating from climate change.<br />In a March 19 paper, Federal Reserve economists said that climate-related hazards, such as more-frequent storms, floods, or wildfires, can quickly change the value of financial assets and affect the availability of credit. Even slow-moving events, like rising sea levels, could cause abrupt changes in investor sentiment, they said."
