The drone landed on a storage hangar at the air base, causing a fire that was later extinguished, according to the U.S.-led coalition.<br />No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Sabreen, a news agency that supports Iranian-backed paramilitary groups, shared news of the attack.<br />It follows months of tensions between the U.S. and Iran, whose allied militias in Iraq have launched a series of attacks on U.S. bases in the country."
