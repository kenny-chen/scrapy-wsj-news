    "body": "CHICAGO—In the Little Village neighborhood where a Chicago police officer killed 13-year-old Adam Toledo, the sound of gunfire has become more common, the Rev. Ramiro Rodriguez said.<br />“We’ve been hearing guns every little while in the nighttime,” said Mr. Rodriguez, who is the pastor of Amor de Dios United Methodist Church, near the site where the boy was killed.<br />Since March 29, some congregants have been afraid to come to church, he said.<br />That was the day that Mr. Toledo was killed by a Chicago police officer responding to reports of shots fired. Video footage released by a civilian oversight group Thursday showed the officer, Eric E. Stillman, chasing the teen down an alley.<br />The officer yelled, “Show me your f— hands.” The boy turned toward the officer with arms raised and nothing in his hands. The officer yelled, “Drop it, drop it,” and immediately fired a single shot before rushing over."
