    "body": "Bernie Madoff, who died Wednesday at 82, is inevitably remembered for running the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. Which makes his death a reminder of the life of Charles Ponzi (1882-1949).<br />Beginning in 1919, Ponzi, a Boston resident, offered to pay investors, within 45 days, $150 for every $100 they lent him. The immigrant from northern Italy credited this spectacular promised return on investment to arbitrage in international postal coupons. These were vouchers that could be enclosed with international letters. The recipient would redeem the voucher for his own country’s stamps and affix them to a reply.<br />Ponzi told would-be lenders that differences in international exchange rates enabled him to buy and sell the coupons and make a hefty profit. You know how this ended.<br />But while Ponzi didn’t make an honest return, he did help to make law. His name became not only an eponym but a Supreme Court case, and the aftermath of his scam led to a second ruling by the justices.<br />In 1921, Ponzi was in federal prison in Massachusetts serving a five-year sentence after pleading guilty to mail fraud. A state court in Suffolk County directed that he be brought before it to stand trial for larceny. Ponzi objected, maintaining that as long as he was in federal custody, the court lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him on state charges."
