    "body": "ELIZABETH CITY, N.C.—A North Carolina deputy shot and killed a Black man while serving a search warrant Wednesday, authorities said, spurring an outcry from community members who demanded law-enforcement accountability and the immediate release of body-camera footage.<br />Authorities wouldn’t provide details of the shooting but an eyewitness said that Andrew Brown Jr. was shot while trying to drive away, and that deputies fired at him multiple times. The car skidded out of Brown’s yard and eventually hit a tree, said Demetria Williams, who lives on the same street.<br />Ms. Williams said after hearing one gunshot, she ran outside, where she saw other shots being fired at the car.<br />“When they opened the door he was already dead,” Ms. Williams told the Associated Press. “He was slumped over.” She said officers tried to perform chest compressions on him.<br />A car that authorities removed from the scene appeared to have multiple bullet holes and a broken rear windshield."
