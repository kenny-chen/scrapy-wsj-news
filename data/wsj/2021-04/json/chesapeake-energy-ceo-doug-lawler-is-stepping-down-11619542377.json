    "body": "Doug Lawler, the chief executive of  Chesapeake Energy Corp. , will leave the company at the end of this month, little more than two months after the shale-gas pioneer emerged from bankruptcy.<br />The Oklahoma City-based company said Tuesday that Mike Wichterich, who became Chesapeake’s chairman in February, will serve as interim CEO as it searches for a new top executive.<br />In an email to employees reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Wichterich said Mr. Lawler’s departure is “not a reflection of his performance or the result of any action on his part,” and that the outgoing executive left the company in “a great position for future success.”<br />Mr. Wichterich said he would lay out his outlook for the company at a town hall meeting Wednesday.<br />“Thanks to you, today Chesapeake sits with talented, adaptable people, great assets, and a pristine balance sheet,” said Mr. Wichterich, also the chief executive of oil producer Three Rivers Operating Company III LLC. “Now is the time to get aggressive and win!”"
