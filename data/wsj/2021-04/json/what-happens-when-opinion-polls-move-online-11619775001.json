    "body": "Your opinion matters. Just ask any pollster.<br />But randomized telephone surveys—a historically reliable way to assess public opinion—have become too pricey for many organizations to conduct, while cheaper online surveys—where the future seems to lie—have delivered some famously inaccurate results.<br />So what happens when research organizations decide it’s time to move traditional polls online? How do they ensure their trusted results will remain reliable?<br />This year, two established surveys took the plunge.<br />The University of Michigan’s Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the longest-running longitudinal study in the world, and the U.S. portion of the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Survey, the largest multinational series focused on global issues, shifted to the web."
