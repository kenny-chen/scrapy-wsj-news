    "body": "Joe Biden has put a presidential imprimatur on climate change being an existential threat, and he doesn’t mean in the Jean-Paul Sartre sense of man’s search for meaning in an uncomforting universe.<br />He means the end of humanity, a claim nowhere found in climate science.<br />This is odd because the real news today is elsewhere. Its movement may be ocean-liner-like, the news may be five years old before the  New York Times  notices it, but the climate community has been backing away from a worst-case scenario peddled to the public for years as “business as usual.”<br />A drumroll moment was Zeke Hausfather and Glen Peter’s 2020 article in the journal Nature partly headlined: “Stop using the worst-case scenario for climate warming as the most likely outcome.”<br />This followed the 2017 paper by Justin Ritchie and Hadi Dowlatabadiasking why climate scenarios posit implausible increases in coal burning a century from now. And I could go on. Roger Pielke Jr. and colleagues show how the RCP 8.5 scenario was born to give modelers a high-emissions scenario to play with, and how it came to be embraced despite being at odds with every real-world indicator concerning the expected course of future emissions."
