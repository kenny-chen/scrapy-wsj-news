    "body": "Bain Capital has raised $11.8 billion for its latest flagship buyout fund, surpassing its target and notching significant participation by people affiliated with the firm, a spokeswoman confirmed.<br />The multistrategy investment manager in Boston collected about $1.8 billion for the vehicle, Bain Capital Fund XIII LP, from current and former employees, the spokeswoman said. Reuters reported on the fundraising earlier Friday.<br />Other investors in the vehicle include the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., which committed $25 million in March, and the Virginia Retirement System, which pledged $225 million in August, WSJ Pro data show. Other commitments from public pension plans include $50 million from the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board and $150 million from the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System, the data show.<br />The new fund surpassed its $9 billion target by 31%.<br />Bain Capital raked in commitments for the North American-focused fund as fundraising in the private-equity industry bounced back from two quarters hit by the global coronavirus pandemic, according to data provider Preqin Ltd. The research company said in April that private-equity funds closed during the first quarter collected about $188 billion world-wide."
