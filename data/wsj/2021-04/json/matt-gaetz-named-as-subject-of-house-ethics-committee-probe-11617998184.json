    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House Ethics Committee said it has begun an investigation into allegations involving Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.), citing a host of alleged abuses including sexual misconduct, the sharing of inappropriate images or videos on the House floor and the improper conversion of campaign funds to personal use.<br />The Ethics Committee said in a statement that the fact of its investigating “does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred.”<br />In laying out its probe, the panel said it was also aware of public allegations against Mr. Gaetz involving the misuse of state identification records, and the acceptance of a bribe, improper gratuity or impermissible gift, in violation of House rules, laws or other standards of conduct.<br />The panel disclosed its probe as scrutiny intensifies around the Florida Republican, who has denied wrongdoing and said he won’t resign.<br />Writing earlier this week in the Washington Examiner, he said, “my personal life is and always has been conducted on my own time and my own dime.” And he added: “I will not be intimidated or extorted.”"
