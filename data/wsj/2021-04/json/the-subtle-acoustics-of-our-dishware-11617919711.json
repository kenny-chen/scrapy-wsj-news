But after months of working from home and cooking everything I eat, the clinks and chimes from crockery being piled up and scrubbed clean have become the cheerful acoustic background to the end of my day.<br />It recently occurred to me that the reason they sound so harmonious is that every plate and bowl really is a small musical instrument. And the more complex shapes, like coffee mugs, move along a physics path that leads all the way to beautiful sounds that aren’t really there.<br />If you use your fingertips to support a small ceramic plate right at its center, then gently tap the edge with a spoon, you’ll hear a really clear tone. The gentle tap makes the plate bend and twist ever so slightly. Although it’s far too subtle for you to see, there’s a dominant symmetrical pattern of vibration: The whole rim vibrates up and down while the plate flexes.<br />This oscillating motion pushes on the air like a loudspeaker, sending out sound at a very specific frequency. Bigger and thicker plates oscillate more slowly, and so send out a deeper note. What you’re hearing is the structure of the plate expressed as its own acoustical signature. All that clinking from the washing up is the singing of the shapes when they’re disturbed from rest."
