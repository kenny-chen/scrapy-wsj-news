    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Like Cher and Oprah, Cándido Camero was so loved and respected by his peers that he went by his first name alone. If he had lived a few more months, he would be celebrating his 100th birthday on April 22, but he died on Nov. 7.<br />Along with fellow Cuban émigré Mongo Santamaría, Cándido was at the forefront of popularizing his primary instrument, the conga—an Afro-Cuban hand drum—in the U.S. The conga is now a familiar sight and sound in urban parks, on recordings and on stage. It’s played not just in such Latin bands as Santana, but in many other popular styles, from salsa to Las Vegas show music. Even such rock groups as the Rolling Stones, the Allman Brothers Band and the Doobie Brothers have recorded with it. In a Smithsonian oral history, Cándido pointed to “the rhythm and the flavor that it gives the music.”"
