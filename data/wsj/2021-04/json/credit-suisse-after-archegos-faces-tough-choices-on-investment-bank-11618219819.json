    "body": "When  Credit Suisse  Group AG announced a $4.7 billion hit from the Archegos Capital Management meltdown, there was a silver lining: The rest of its investment bank did so well in the quarter, the overall pretax loss would only be $1 billion.<br />The situation exposes the bank’s dilemma.
