    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Knowledgeable and respectful of country’s history, but not shackled by it, Eric Church has tested the genre’s boundaries and achieved commercial success during his 15-year career—not a simple combination today.<br />He has saluted traditional country and Merle Haggard (in the 2006 track “Pledge Allegiance to the Hag”) and what the roots rock of your younger years can mean and keep on meaning, too (with the hit 2012 single “Springsteen”). And he has sung about the varied, life-altering records he plays obsessively—from George Jones to James Brown, New Grass Revival to Jeff Tweedy—on his remarkable multigenre 2015 album, “Mr. Misunderstood.”"
