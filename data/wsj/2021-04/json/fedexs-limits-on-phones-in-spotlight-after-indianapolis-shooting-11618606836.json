    "body": "When a gunman began shooting at a  FedEx Corp.  facility in Indianapolis late Thursday night, many workers didn’t have access to their mobile phones to call for help or loved ones.<br />FedEx policy prohibits most workers from having cellphones inside the company’s sprawling sortation centers, citing safety reasons. Some workers leave them in their vehicles or lockers before starting their shifts. The situation prompted some people on social media to criticize the delivery company for its policy.<br />Indianapolis police officials said the cellphone policy didn’t appear to delay the reporting of the deadly shooting to authorities. Police said many FedEx workers didn’t have their phones after the late-night incident, which delayed their ability to reach family members.<br />“That was certainly frustrating for those employees as well as their families,” Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Deputy Chief Craig McCartt said at a news conference Friday.<br />A FedEx spokeswoman said only some workers are authorized to have access to their phones in certain areas of FedEx Ground facilities, in order to “minimize potential distractions around package sortation equipment and dock operations.”"
