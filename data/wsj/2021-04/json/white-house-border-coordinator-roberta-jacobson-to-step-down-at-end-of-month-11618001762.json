    "body": "Roberta Jacobson, the White House’s border coordinator, will step down at the end of the month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement Friday.<br />Ms. Jacobson’s tenure has been “consistent with her commitment at the outset to serve in the Administration’s first 100 days,” Mr. Sullivan said in the statement.<br />Her departure comes as a record number of unaccompanied minors crossed the border illegally in March and the total number of illegal border crossings this year is on pace to hit a two-decade high. Ms. Jacobson previously served as ambassador to Mexico.<br />Amid growing bipartisan pressure to tackle the surge of migrants at the border, President Biden has stepped up the administration’s diplomatic efforts. Ms. Jacobson was among the administration officials who traveled to Mexico and Guatemala recently to hold talks with the governments of those countries.<br />Mr. Biden asked Vice President Kamala Harris last month to lead the administration’s diplomatic efforts related to the border surge, working with Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras."
