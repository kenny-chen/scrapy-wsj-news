    "body": "VIENNA—Iran said Friday it had enriched uranium at 60% purity for the first time, a move that comes in response to an attack on its main nuclear facility, and which has complicated ongoing talks between Tehran and international powers in Vienna to revive a 2015 nuclear accord.<br />“I proudly announce that at 00:40 this morning, young Iranian scientists... achieved uranium of 60% purity,” Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said, according to state media.<br />The head of Iran’s nuclear agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, confirmed the step to state television, saying Iran was now producing nine grams of 60%-enriched uranium per hour.<br />Tehran’s latest acceleration of its nuclear program beyond the limits of the 2015 deal comes after it accused Israel of attacking its Natanz nuclear facility on Sunday, causing a blackout that destroyed a number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Israel hasn’t commented directly on the allegation, as per official policy.<br />Although the actual amount of 60%-enriched uranium that Iran is able to produce will be small initially, Western officials worry that the process of enriching closer to weapons grade of 90% purity will allow Iranian scientists and engineers to gain new insight into a critical building block in creating a nuclear weapon."
