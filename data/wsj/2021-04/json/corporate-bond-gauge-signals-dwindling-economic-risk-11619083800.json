    "body": "A key measure of the perceived risk in low-rated corporate bonds is hovering around its lowest level in more than a decade, highlighting investors’ mounting confidence in the economic outlook.<br />The average extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold speculative-grade corporate bonds over U.S. Treasurys dropped below 3 percentage points this month to as low as 2.90 percentage points for the first time since 2007, when it set a record of 2.33 percentage points, according to Bloomberg Barclays data.<br />Yields on low-rated corporate bonds already hit a record low of 3.89% in February. That data point is especially important for businesses, because it signals how cheaply they can borrow when they issue new bonds. Companies including  Charter Communications Inc.  and  United Airlines Holdings Inc.  have issued a total of $184.5 billion of speculative-grade bonds this year through Tuesday, the highest over that period on record, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence.<br />The spread relative to Treasurys, however, is arguably an even better measure of investors’ outlook for the economy, since it shows how much investors feel they need to be compensated for the risk that companies may default on their debt.<br />The narrow speculative-grade bond spreads indicate debt investors think that the economic environment for businesses over the next several years could be better than at any time since the 2008-2009 financial crisis—a striking development after many feared a severe, long-lasting economic downturn just last year."
