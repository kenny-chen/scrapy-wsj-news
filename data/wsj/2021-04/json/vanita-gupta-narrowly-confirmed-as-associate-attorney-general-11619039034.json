    "body": "The Senate confirmed Vanita Gupta as associate attorney general, installing a longtime civil-rights lawyer as the Justice Department’s No. 3 official as the agency launches the kind of sweeping investigations of local police departments that she has long championed.<br />Ms. Gupta was confirmed in a 51-49 vote, overcoming Republicans’ complaints about her views on policing and past criticism of conservatives. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was the lone Republican to support Ms. Gupta’s confirmation.<br />“The White House needs to make a better choice for this key post,” said Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). Ms. Murkowski, who met personally with Ms. Gupta, said she was “impressed with not only her professional credentials” but also with her passion for the work she performs.<br />Ms. Gupta, 46 years old, was head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division during the Obama administration and most recently president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, where she vocally criticized Trump administration policies ranging from immigration to federal judicial appointees.<br />Her confirmation comes as Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the Justice Department would investigate whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in patterns of unconstitutional conduct, a federal civil-rights probe Ms. Gupta had advocated as leader of the Washington-based advocacy group."
