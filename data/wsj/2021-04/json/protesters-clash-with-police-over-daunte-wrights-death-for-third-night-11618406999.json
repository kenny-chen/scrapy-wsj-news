    "body": "BROOKLYN CENTER, Minn.—Pressure is mounting on authorities to quickly charge the officer who killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright following another night of clashes between protesters and police that led to over 60 arrests.<br />A decision on whether to charge former officer Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran of the police force, could come as soon as Wednesday. Washington County Attorney Pete Orput is reviewing the case. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Tuesday that he expects Mr. Orput to move quickly. Mr. Orput’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />On Tuesday night, hundreds of local police, National Guard and state troopers deployed flash bangs and chemical irritants on protesters gathered outside the Brooklyn Center Police Department. Shortly before 9 p.m., as some in the crowd jostled temporary fencing in front of the department, authorities in riot gear alongside armored vehicles pushed back protesters and began making arrests, declaring the event an unlawful assembly.<br />Col. Matt Langer of the Minnesota State Patrol said early Wednesday that there had been upward of 60 arrests during the protest, adding “as the evening unfolded, the event devolved and became more contentious.”<br />“Decisions were made to provide dispersal orders to encourage the group to leave,” he said at a news conference."
