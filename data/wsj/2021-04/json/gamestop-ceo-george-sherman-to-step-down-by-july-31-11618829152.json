    "body": "GameStop Corp.  said Chief Executive George Sherman will step down by July 31, the latest in a series of changes to the videogame retailer’s leadership team since Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen became a board member in January.<br />Mr. Cohen, who has been nominated as GameStop’s chairman, had urged the company to focus on e-commerce and reduce store count, among other initiatives. The company is now working to transform its decades-old bricks-and-mortar business to become more technology-centric.<br />Mr. Sherman has been chief executive officer since 2019. The company on Monday pointed to its annual filing in March that said the board has retained a third-party firm to evaluate executive leadership. GameStop is focusing its search on candidates with a background in the technology or the videogame industry, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.<br />Write to Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com"
