    "body": "SYDNEY—A run-up in the price of iron ore to a decade high is blunting China’s pressure tactics in a major trade dispute.<br />China imposed a series of import restrictions and tariffs on Australian products including barley and beef last year, after being angered by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s call for an international investigation into the first outbreak of Covid-19 in China. But its reliance on iron ore from Australia meant the steelmaking ingredient wasn’t targeted by Beijing.<br />Now, China’s demand for iron ore to feed its steel mills and underpin its economic recovery has driven the industry’s benchmark price to its highest level since February 2011. That is providing a revenue boost to Australia, which accounts for more than 50% of global iron-ore exports, as it navigates tensions with its largest trade partner.<br />The price of iron ore—one of the world’s most traded commodities—rose to $187.75 a metric ton on April 20, according to S&P Global Platts. It has risen 17% over the past month, extending a rally that began when prices were below $100 a ton less than a year ago.<br />“It’s certainly good news for miners and the Australian economy,” said AMP Capital Chief Economist Shane Oliver. He predicted more large trade surpluses for Australia, while iron-ore miners will pay more in tax that will improve Australia’s budget deficit."
