    "body": "Former Vice President Walter Mondale, a civil rights champion who lost a 1984 White House bid in one of the largest Electoral College landslides in U.S. history, died Monday evening at his home in Minneapolis. He was 93.<br />Mr. Mondale had died peacefully of natural causes, said Kathy Tunheim, a family spokeswoman. He had received numerous calls in recent days from past and present political leaders and enjoyed sharing memories with them, she said.<br />Mr. Mondale, the 42nd vice president, was credited with boosting the status of the office with his deep involvement in shaping policy, influencing administration appointments and conducting foreign policy negotiations.<br />“I was the first vice president to be in the White House working daily with the president,” Mr. Mondale said in a 2008 documentary about his life.<br />Before agreeing to be Jimmy Carter’s 1976 Democratic running mate, Mr. Mondale—known as “Fritz” to family, friends and many voters—wrote a memo outlining his expectations, should they win. Among Mr. Mondale’s demands was that he be invited to all cabinet meetings and that the two men would confer at least weekly."
