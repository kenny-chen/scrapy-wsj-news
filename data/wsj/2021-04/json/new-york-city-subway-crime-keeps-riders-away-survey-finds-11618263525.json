    "body": "New York’s subway chief said she is concerned that rising fears about transit crime could depress ridership as New York City emerges from its pandemic-related restrictions.<br />A new survey conducted by New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority found riders are more concerned about crime and harassment on trains and in stations now than they were six months ago. It also found that fear of crime is an impediment to people returning to the system.<br />Sarah Feinberg, interim president of the state-controlled MTA’s subway division, said that this spring, summer and fall would be a crucial period as businesses and offices reopen and more people consider re-entering the transit system.<br />“This is a crystal-clear message from our existing customers and those contemplating returning: ‘If there is a safe system, I will come back,’ ” Ms. Feinberg said.<br />An NYPD spokesman said Monday that “the New York City Police Department, on a day-to-day basis, remains flexible and ever prepared to reallocate its personnel to respond to any upticks in crime.”"
