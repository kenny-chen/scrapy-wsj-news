    "body": "NEW DELHI—India imposed a lockdown on its capital city and said it would expand its vaccination program to all adults, as the country struggled to keep the world’s fastest-growing surge of Covid-19 infections from overwhelming its healthcare system.<br />India has sought to avoid the strict lockdowns that punished its economy last spring, but the New Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday that the step was necessary to avoid an even bigger disaster: a complete breakdown of its hospitals. Already, some were turning away patients and running low on oxygen and other supplies.<br />“I don’t say that the system has collapsed, but it has reached its limits,” he said.<br />The latest wave of cases has risen much faster than the country’s monthslong surge last year, moving the country to the center of a pandemic that has killed at least three million people world-wide. India has reported more than 200,000 new daily infections for five days straight, with the number surpassing 270,000 on Monday.<br />On Monday, Delhi reported 25,463 infections in the past 24 hours, nearly three times its biggest daily tally of 8,500 cases during a November peak."
