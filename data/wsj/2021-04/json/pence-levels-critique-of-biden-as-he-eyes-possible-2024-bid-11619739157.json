    "body": "Mike Pence, in his first public speech since leaving office in January, was highly critical Thursday evening of President Biden’s new administration, as the former Republican vice president positioned himself for a potential 2024 White House bid.<br />“The Biden-Harris administration has launched an avalanche of big government, liberal policies that threaten to derail all the progress we made,” the Republican was expected to tell a conservative audience in Columbia, S.C.<br />Mr. Pence, in remarks shared ahead of delivery, was to say that the Biden administration has tried to use the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to “fund a massive expansion of the welfare state.”<br />His appearance at a convention center was sponsored by the Palmetto Family Council, a conservative Christian group. The venue, in a state that traditionally hosts the first presidential primary in the South, fueled speculation Mr. Pence is contemplating a run for higher office.<br />But Mr. Pence’s up-and-down relationship with former President Donald Trump, who still commands the loyalty of much of the party, could complicate his former No. 2’s path."
