    "body": "<br />After the worst year for the global economy since the Great Depression, the West looks set for a vigorous rebound as mass vaccination against Covid-19 propels a return to more or less normal life.<br />The revival, though, will come in stages, as the timing and speed of recoveries in North America and Europe will depend largely on the pace and reach of vaccination, economists say. Economies in North America and Europe are expected to fire up as shops, restaurants and hotels throng with newly inoculated consumers armed with savings they amassed during the long pandemic. Moodyâ€™s Analytics estimates households world-wide had $5.4 trillion in pandemic-related savings at the end of the first quarter.<br />Countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. are expected to enjoy quicker consumer-led recoveries as their governments close in on vaccination goals. Data Thursday are expected to show  the U.S. growth accelerated in the first quarter as coronavirus-related restrictions eased and vaccination coverage increased.<br />In Europe, where vaccination drives have been beset with supply hiccups and worries over side effects, economies are likely to take longer to shake off their lockdown-induced torpor. Data Friday are expected to show the 19-nation eurozone shrank in the first quarter as chunks of the currency area reimposed public-health restrictions to tame new waves of infection, though more up-to-date business surveys suggest growth was already coming back in April."
