    "body": "Hollywood is ready to get dressed up again. After a year of pandemic isolation, closed movie theaters and virtual awards ceremonies, the Oscars returned to a scaled-down but lively red carpet at Union Station in Los Angeles Sunday. Additional hubs in Paris and London provided opportunities for nominees across the pond to gather. Exuberance—both sartorial and emotional—was on display. “People are just dying to be out,” said E presenter Naz Perez.<br />According to an email from the show’s producers, the dress code for this hybrid event was described as “a fusion of inspirational and aspirational, which in actual words means formal is totally cool if you want to go there, but casual is really not.” Stars appeared to have interpreted this as a call for fun and flair, with unorthodox suiting, surprising choices and lots of color all in full effect.<br />“After a year of not getting dressed, obviously everyone is like let’s get dressed,” said Michael Fisher, a New York-based celebrity stylist, who dressed presenter Bryan Cranston in a classically appointed tuxedo by Prada.<br />Many men departed from that classic script, taking this modified red carpet as an opportunity for maximum rule breaking. Colman Domingo of “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” made a splash in a taut flamingo-pink, three-piece suit by Atelier Versace that was embellished with 4,500 Swarovski crystals. Fan favorite Alan Kim, the 9-year-old “Minari” star, wore a Thom Browne shorts suit with dark knee socks (but his best accessory preshow was his adorable puppy Cream).<br />For several stars, their exuberance appeared to take the form of dressing as an actual Oscar statuette, by dressing in attention-grabbing gold. Leslie Odom Jr., who starred as Sam Cooke in “One Night in Miami…,” arrived in a metallic gold Brioni suit with a matching gold shirt and pocket square. Andra Day, nominated for her role as Billie Holiday in “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” drew inspiration from the icon herself, as well as Diana Ross in her interpretation, for her gold metal mesh Vera Wang gown. Best-actress nominee for “Promising Young Woman,” Carey Mulligan wore a golden combo by Valentino Haute Couture. Questlove, the musical director for the show, finished off his otherwise dark outfit with a pair of shimmering gold Crocs."
