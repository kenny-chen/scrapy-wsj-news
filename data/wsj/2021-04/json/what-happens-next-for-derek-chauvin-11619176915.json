    "body": "Following Derek Chauvin’s murder and manslaughter conviction, his lawyer and prosecutors are now preparing for the next phase of his case—sentencing. Still left to be decided: how long the former Minneapolis police officer will spend behind bars for killing George Floyd while arresting him last year. He also faces a separate tax case.<br />Here’s a look at what happens next:<br />Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over Mr. Chauvin’s trial, said sentencing would come about eight weeks after Tuesday’s verdict, or some time in mid-June.<br />That is uncertain. Mr. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but only the second-degree murder charge is relevant to his sentence. While the offense carries a maximum of 40 years behind bars, Minnesota’s sentencing guidelines recommend a punishment of up to 15 years, based on Mr. Chauvin’s clean record. Prosecutors, though, are asking for a longer sentence than the guidelines recommend.<br />In August, prosecutors filed a motion saying they would seek a harsher sentence than recommended in the guidelines. The government argued that the departure was justified because of several aggravating factors, including that Mr. Floyd was “particularly vulnerable” and that Mr. Chauvin treated him with “particular cruelty” by kneeling on his back and neck even while he was unconscious."
