    "body": "Seventeen House Democrats from New York wrote their leaders April 13 threatening “to oppose any tax legislation that does not include a full repeal of the SALT limitation.” That’s an acronym for state and local taxes, only $10,000 of which are deductible on an individual tax return under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The White House has signaled its openness to abolishing the cap.<br />“The SALT deduction was essential to New York and other progressive states,” the Empire State lawmakers write. Restoring it “would ensure that the state is able to recover as quickly as possible without sacrificing the benefits on which our residents rely.”<br />Democratic governors and local lawmakers dream of socialism without taxation, whereby local spending is partly financed by taxpayers from more fiscally prudent jurisdictions. Without the SALT-deduction subsidy, their policies become even more of a nightmare for taxpayers, who in growing numbers are leaving behind big-government states.<br />Reinstating the SALT deduction is meant to ease the pressure on high-tax states’ finances by shifting some of the burden to taxpayers in low-tax states, thereby reducing the incentive for taxpayers to move. It’s a political solution to an economic problem caused by politicians.<br />State and local governments are already highly misaligned in their incentives to tax and spend too much. More than a third of their total revenue comes from so-called intergovernmental transfers, which tilt trade-offs to favor government growth. The federal government pays the majority of the largest spending item on the state level, Medicaid. The 20% or so of President Biden’s “infrastructure” plan dedicated to Medicaid would only add to this problem, as will the bailouts of local governments in the American Rescue Plan, the most recent Covid relief bill."
