    "body": "<br />This week’s economic calendar includes key readings on China’s exports and gross domestic product, as well as U.S. inflation, consumer spending and industrial production.<br />China’s March exports are expected to rebound sharply from a year earlier when Covid-19 depressed economic activity at home and abroad. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal are forecasting a 40% annual increase, a sharp reversal from the 6.6% contraction in the year-earlier period. Similar to the exports, the country’s import sector is expected to see 25% growth in March, reversing a year-earlier decline of 0.9%.<br />U.S. consumer prices are expected to pick up in March, a potential signal of building inflation pressures amid a big dose of fiscal stimulus, rising consumer spending and supply-chain bottlenecks. Most policy makers and many economists, however, are forecasting that relatively strong consumer-price gains will be short-lived.<br />Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks virtually to the Economic Club of Washington. Mr. Powell is likely to maintain the central bank’s mantra on inflation—that any upward pressure on consumer prices from fiscal stimulus “will be neither particularly large nor persistent.”"
