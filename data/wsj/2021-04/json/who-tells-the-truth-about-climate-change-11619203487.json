    "body": "Regarding Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.’s “The Weekend Interview With Steven Koonin: How a Physicist Became a Climate Truth Teller” (April 17): Politicians want to believe that averages of different climate models have credibility beyond what science supports. Mr. Koonin is correct to conclude these models “are not to the standard you would trust your life to or even trillions of dollars to.”<br />I was on the leading edge of computer simulation modeling, employing in 1964 a super computer ( IBM  7094) and a simulation language called simscript. I wasn’t modeling climate change, but I quickly learned that data availability was key to accurate forecasts. In climate models, the number of variables is huge and incomplete. For example, there is no way to measure and verify the effect of clouds on climate change. Climate models also have relatively limited time frames of known data. Climate has been changing for millions of years, but accurate global temperatures were never recorded until 1850.<br />Ron Dudley<br />Sanibel, Fla.<br />"
