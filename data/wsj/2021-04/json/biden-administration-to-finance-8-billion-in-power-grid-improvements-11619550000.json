    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration rolled out new programs Tuesday to bolster the U.S. power grid, framing them as part of its effort to fight climate change through infrastructure improvements needed to expand use of alternative energy.<br />The core initiatives provide more than $8 billion of Energy Department financing for new high-voltage transmission lines. In addition, the White House said it was issuing new guidance to states on how to remove obstacles to construction of new power lines along highways, railroads and other rights of way.<br />President Biden has backed new electric-transmission capacity as a way to boost low-carbon energy supply by connecting the often remote hot spots for wind and solar power to more populated areas.<br />Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has been seeking to revive her agency’s loan program to help, saying better grid connections will also boost reliability during extreme weather, pointing to the recent blackout crises in Texas and last year in California.<br />“We have to add hundreds of gigawatts of clean energy to the grid to get to the goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and net zero carbon emissions by 2050,” Ms. Granholm said in an interview  Tuesday on The Journal, a podcast from The Wall Street Journal and Gimlet Media. “So ‘deploy, deploy deploy’ is our mantra.”"
