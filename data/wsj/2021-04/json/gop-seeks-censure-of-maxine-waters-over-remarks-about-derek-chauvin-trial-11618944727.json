    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Democrats defeated an effort by Republicans Tuesday to censure Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) over her remarks related to the high-profile trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd.<br />In a party-line vote held shortly before Mr. Chauvin was convicted of murder, the House voted 216-210 to table a vote on a resolution censuring Ms. Waters.<br />The dispute centers on comments Ms. Waters made over the weekend at a protest in the Minneapolis area. Ms. Waters said she would urge a more confrontational approach over the U.S. legal system’s treatment of Blacks if the jury, which had begun deliberations in the case, doesn’t return a guilty verdict.<br />“We’re looking for a guilty verdict,” Ms. Waters told reporters. Asked what should happen if there wasn’t a guilty verdict, she said: “We’ve got to get more active. We’ve got to get more confrontational. We’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.”<br />Ms. Waters later clarified her remarks. “I am nonviolent,” she told theGrio in an interview posted Monday. “I talk about confronting the justice system, confronting the policing that’s going on, I’m talking about speaking up. I’m talking about legislation.”"
