    "body": "JPMorgan Chase  & Co. made a rare public apology, saying its role providing the financial backing for a new European soccer league was a misjudgment.<br />The breakaway Super League aimed to reshape the European soccer landscape but collapsed this week as six of the proposed circuit’s 12 elite clubs pulled out following ferocious outcry from fans, rival clubs, players, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prince William, the president of England’s Football Association.<br />JPMorgan pledged around $4 billion of financing to get the new Super League off the ground. It worked with the 12 clubs, including  Manchester United ,  Barcelona and Juventus, as well as a Madrid-based firm called Key Capital Partners, which has a long-running relationship with Real Madrid President Florentino Perez’s international construction company.<br />“We clearly misjudged how this deal would be viewed by the wider football community and how it might impact them in the future,” a spokesman for the bank said. “We will learn from this.”<br />The widespread criticism of the elite sports project that JPMorgan backed jars with the stated goal of Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, to work closely with the communities where it operates. Mr. Dimon wrote to shareholders earlier this month that “businesses must earn the trust of their customers and communities by acting ethically and morally.”"
