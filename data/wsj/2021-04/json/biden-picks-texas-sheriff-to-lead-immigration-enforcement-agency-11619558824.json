    "body": "President Biden said he would nominate Ed Gonzalez, the sheriff of Texas’s most populous county and a critic of Trump-era immigration policies, to serve as director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.<br />The nomination comes as the Biden administration contends with a surge of migrants crossing illegally at the southern border, with migrant arrests there hitting a 15-year high in March. The administration’s response has been met with criticism from both sides of the aisle.<br />Mr. Gonzalez, who has served as Harris County sheriff since 2017, ended a partnership that year with ICE—the Department of Homeland Security agency that is charged with arresting and deporting immigrants—that authorized local officials to enforce federal immigration laws in the county.<br />ICE has said the program creating those partnerships, which was adopted under federal law in 1996, helps local and federal officials better identify and remove criminals from the country.<br />Mr. Gonzalez also criticized immigration raids under the Trump administration in a tweet in July 2019. “I do not support #ICERaids that threaten to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, the vast majority of whom do not represent a threat to the U.S.,” Mr. Gonzalez wrote that month, when the raids occurred. “The focus should always be on clear & immediate safety threats.”"
