    "body": "ISTANBUL—Turkey’s central bank held interest rates steady on Thursday in the first major decision since President Recep Tayyip Erdoganreplaced the institution’s chief last month in a move that sparked a selloff in Turkish assets.<br />The bank kept its key one-week repo rate at 19%, a move that is unlikely to woo foreign investors back. The ousting of Gov. Naci Agbal was the latest in a series of abrupt economic decisions by Mr. Erdogan, and has heightened concern over the nation’s economic stability and intensified the political challenges for Turkey’s leader.<br />Mr. Agbal’s removal caused investors to pull nearly $2 billion from the country in the following weeks. During his four months in office, Mr. Agbal had inspired investors’ confidence by raising interest rates in an effort to control inflation, but he ran afoul of Mr. Erdogan, who favors low rates to encourage economic growth.<br />The new governor, Sahap Kavcioglu, is a former member of parliament from Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development party who has also voiced support for low interest rates.<br />“The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability,” the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said in a statement."
