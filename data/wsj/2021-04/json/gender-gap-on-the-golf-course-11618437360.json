    "body": "Pebble Beach, Calif.<br />One of the great mysteries in amateur sports is being probed again this spring: Why do so many women use colored golf balls, while most men continue to reject them?<br />Scientifically there is little doubt that nonwhite balls, particularly yellow ones, are easier to track in flight and easier to spot in the rough, which speeds play. Yet resistance remains among many male golfers, who persist in associating colored balls with high handicaps—and with women. Female golfers have long accepted balls in a variety of hues.<br />More than color separates men’s and women’s golf balls. Compression differs, as do spin rates and even the number of dimples. But the only effect a ball’s color has on any player’s performance is mental.<br />Manufacturers target women with a dazzling array of colored golf balls, such as Srixon’s Soft Feel Lady ball in “passion pink.”  For men, the change from white is slow, but Titleist, Callaway and TaylorMade have added yellow versions to their most expensive, tour-quality golf balls."
