    "body": "In the darkness, Don Nicholas’s memories of fighting in Vietnam and Afghanistan blur into a single dream. The shapeless green of the Southeast Asian jungle morphs into the brown ridges of the Hindu Kush, finally settling into black until his yells wake his wife.<br />Mr. Nicholas is a rarity in the U.S. military. He served as a Marine guard at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon when the South Vietnamese capital fell in 1975 and, decades later, as an Army foot soldier patrolling the mountains of Afghanistan.<br />President Biden decided this month to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, much as President Richard Nixon in 1973 pulled American combat forces out of Vietnam. That leaves several generations of veterans wrestling with the ambiguous aftermath of wars unwon.<br />Many Afghanistan vets are glad to see U.S. troops return home and the flow of casualties come to a stop. At the same time, they wonder if the blood and treasure were well spent in a war that, if not a loss, certainly wasn’t a victory.<br />Mr. Nicholas has confronted for years the ambivalence of such unsatisfying conclusions and allies left behind to face the consequences. “The same thing that happened in Vietnam is happening here,” said Mr. Nicholas, now 68 and living in Green, Ohio."
