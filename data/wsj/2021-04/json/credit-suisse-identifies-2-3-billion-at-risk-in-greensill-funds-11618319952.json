    "body": "Credit Suisse  Group AG flagged around $2.3 billion in problematic loans in its Greensill Capital funds, giving investors in the funds a more concrete sense of the size of their potential losses from the U.K. firm’s demise.<br />The Swiss bank is liquidating $10 billion in a group of funds it ran with Greensill. In a Tuesday update, Credit Suisse said so far it has gotten $5.4 billion back for investors.<br />The bank said three borrowers are “driving the valuation uncertainty” in the remainder of the four funds’ investments. The three borrowers are metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance; West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice’s coal company,  Bluestone Resources Inc. ; and  SoftBank Group Corp. -backed construction startup Katerra.<br />GFG companies owe the funds $1.2 billion, while Bluestone owes $690 million. Katerra owes $440 million.<br />The bank is working to recover the amounts it identified, but it isn’t yet clear how much it will eventually get back."
