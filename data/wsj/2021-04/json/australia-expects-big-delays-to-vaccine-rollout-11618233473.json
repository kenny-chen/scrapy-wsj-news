    "body": "SYDNEY—Australia expects its Covid-19 vaccination campaign to be delayed by months because of concerns over side effects from the  AstraZeneca  PLC vaccine and supply-chain issues, in a setback that threatens to extend its border closure and weigh on its economic recovery.<br />Australia’s leaders had planned to have 4 million people vaccinated against the coronavirus by the end of March. But nearly two weeks into April, authorities have vaccinated only about 1.2 million people, or roughly 5% of the population. They had previously said they would aim to vaccinate its entire population by October but now aren’t sure when that might happen.<br />“Rather than set targets that can get knocked about by every to and fro of international supply chains and other disruptions that can occur, we’re just getting on with it,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Monday in a video posted to  Facebook .  Over the weekend, Mr. Morrison said he now hoped Australians could get a first dose before the end of the year, but he didn’t commit to that date and said the government wouldn’t set a new target.<br />Australian officials were relying in large part on the AstraZeneca vaccine because it can be produced locally. But they have blamed the slow rollout on a delay in shipping AstraZeneca vaccines from Europe, which was supposed to boost early vaccination efforts as Australia ramped up its ability to make the vaccines domestically.<br />The bet on AstraZeneca ran into further challenges last week when Australia’s drug regulator said the vaccine should be given only to people over 50 because of the risk of rare but sometimes deadly blood clotting. That forced Australian officials to restrict the rollout of the vaccine, with other countries taking similar steps."
