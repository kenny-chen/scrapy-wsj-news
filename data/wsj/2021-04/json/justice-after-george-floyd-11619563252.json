    "body": "Editor’s note: This week’s Future View discusses the meaning of the Chauvin trial in Minnesota. Next week we’ll ask, “What’s the single best or worst thing President Biden did during his first 100 days in office?” Students can click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before May 4. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Who Had Faith in Due Process of Law?<br />The response to the Derek Chauvin case indicates how little faith Americans have in the integrity of the judicial system. Liberals and Democrats expressed relief at the verdict, while many conservatives criticized it. Many on both sides seemed to believe they knew the “right verdict” in advance, and then reacted to the jury’s decision accordingly. Few showed any inclination to trust the jury’s deliberation and judgment on their own terms. Since judicial bodies are designed to be authoritative sources, this is highly concerning. If Americans no longer hold any special reverence for institutions of jury and court, the legitimacy of the entire legal system is at risk.<br />—Thomas Brodey, Amherst College, history"
