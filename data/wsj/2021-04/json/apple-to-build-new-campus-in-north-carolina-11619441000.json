    "body": "Apple Inc.  said it would build a new campus and engineering hub in North Carolina as part of a series of investments planned in the U.S. over the next five years.<br />The technology giant said Monday the move would create at least 3,000 jobs in machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering and other fields in the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area.<br />Those new jobs were part of a pledge to add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. by 2026, up from the roughly 95,000 people employed currently. Apple said in January 2018 it had 84,000 people in its U.S. workforce.<br />The Cupertino, Calif., company had been in talks three years ago to locate a facility in North Carolina and state officials had approved economic incentives to support the development opportunity.<br />But later that year the company announced a plan to locate a campus in Austin, Texas."
