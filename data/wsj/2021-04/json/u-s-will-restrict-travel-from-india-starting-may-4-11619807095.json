    "body": "The Biden administration will restrict travel from India beginning Tuesday the White House said Friday, as concerns mount over a record surge in coronavirus cases there.<br />“On the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the administration will restrict travel from India,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. “The policy will be implemented in light of extraordinarily high Covid-19 caseloads and multiple variants circulating in India.”<br />An administration official said the ban on travel from India wouldn’t apply to U.S. citizens, permanent residents and other exempted individuals, such as humanitarian workers. But those individuals would still need to meet testing and quarantine requirements currently in effect for international travelers should they enter the U.S.<br />A spokesman for the Indian Embassy had no immediate comment.<br />The announcement comes as India set a global record for new infections, prompting several countries to impose similar travel restrictions. The U.K., Canada, Germany, France and Australia were among the growing list of countries to ban most travelers from India in recent weeks."
