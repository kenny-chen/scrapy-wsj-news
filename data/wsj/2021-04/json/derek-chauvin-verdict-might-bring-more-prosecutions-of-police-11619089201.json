    "body": "Tuesday’s murder conviction of Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd will likely make prosecutors more willing to charge police officers in shootings, according to district attorneys and law-enforcement researchers.<br />Guilty verdicts against police officers who kill people in the line of duty have historically been rare. Of the 140 police officers charged in fatal shootings since 2005, seven were convicted of murder and 37 were convicted of lesser crimes, according to research by Philip Stinson, a Bowling Green State University criminologist who studies the topic.<br />There are about 1,000 deadly police shootings a year, Mr. Stinson has found.<br />But increased attention to police misconduct, more video evidence of encounters with civilians, and the precedent of a jury handing down a high-profile conviction against Mr. Chauvin after about 10 hours of deliberation are all likely to compel prosecutors to be more aggressive in such cases, the prosecutors said.<br />“In the past, we knew that juries were reluctant to convict police officers,” said Steve Wagstaffe, district attorney in California’s San Mateo County and past president of the California District Attorneys Association. The Chauvin verdict will factor into prosecutors’ decisions in the future if they believe that “juries will be more willing to conclude that there can be an officer who was a bad apple and hence willing to convict,” he said."
