    "body": "Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform government, from how it spends taxpayer money and delivers services to how it protects the public and fights wars.<br />But it can’t do that without a key ingredient: talent.<br />The problem is that the government isn’t on the cutting edge of tech talent, in part because it has to compete with the private sector, where the payoff is so much greater.<br />So, how does Washington attract—and keep—the people it needs to develop this new technology?<br />The Wall Street Journal asked three experts to debate the issue. Yll Bajraktari is executive director of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a group of industry executives and academics that has studied the government’s AI needs. Martial Hebert is dean of the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science. Megan McConnell is a McKinsey & Co. partner who advises public-sector organizations on human-capital management, with a focus on AI."
