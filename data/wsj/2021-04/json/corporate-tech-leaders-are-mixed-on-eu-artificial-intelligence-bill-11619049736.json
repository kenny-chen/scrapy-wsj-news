    "body": "Some corporate technology leaders say a proposed clampdown by European regulators on the use of artificial intelligence will run up costs and stifle innovation, just as companies are starting to unlock its potential.<br />Others say stronger oversight will help build public trust in AI systems, which have inflamed tensions over data privacy, consumer protection and misuse—especially in areas like facial recognition.<br />Thomas Donnelly, chief information officer of software firm BetterCloud Inc., said the proposed restrictions will have a negative impact on Europe’s technology sector over the long term, as companies elsewhere gain a competitive edge by continuing to develop cheaper and more efficient AI-powered applications.<br />“I’ve been doing IT for a long time,” Mr. Donnelly said in an email. “I’ve never seen tech as transformative as AI since the internet.”<br />The European Union’s executive arm on Wednesday unveiled legislation that would ban the use of certain kinds of AI systems, while limiting the use of facial recognition by police."
