    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department will open a broad civil-rights investigation into the practices of the Louisville Metro Police Department, Attorney General Merrick Garland said Monday, more than a year after the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in her home during a botched police raid.<br />The inquiry will examine whether Louisville officers routinely violate citizens’ rights, including by illegally executing search warrants on private homes, Mr. Garland said. It will also seek to determine whether officers use excessive force, discriminate based on race and engage in unconstitutional stops, arrests and seizures.<br />“Investigators will seek input from every corner of Louisville,” Mr. Garland said.<br />It is the second such probe the Justice Department has launched in a week, as the agency takes a more active role in overhauling local police agencies.<br />Mr. Garland on Wednesday said the department would examine whether Minneapolis police engage in excessive force and discriminatory practices, a day after a state jury convicted Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd, whose killing, following Ms. Taylor’s, touched off nationwide protests over policing and racial injustice."
