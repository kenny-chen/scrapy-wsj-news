    "body": "John Williamson was merely trying to be helpful in 1989 when he listed 10 economic policy ideas he thought most economists would endorse.<br />The English-born economist’s list—confusingly dubbed the Washington Consensus, even though it wasn’t meant to be a prescription from Uncle Sam—set off an uproar among his colleagues that still hasn’t completely subsided.<br />The list included removing barriers to trade and focusing government spending on health, education and infrastructure rather than on subsidies. He favored openness to foreign investment and market economies rather than socialism. He was offering a guide to orthodox economic thinking as of 1989, not proposing an ideology.<br />Dr. Williamson didn’t mean to suggest that by some miracle economists had buried their myriad differences. Nor was he telling the rest of the world to adopt the policies of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, some of which he saw as misguided.<br />In short, he was famous for being misunderstood. “Audiences the world over seem to believe that [the Washington Consensus] signifies a set of neoliberal policies that have been imposed on hapless countries by the Washington-based international financial institutions and have led them to crisis and misery,” he wrote in the outline for a 2002 speech. “There are people who cannot utter the term without foaming at the mouth.”"
