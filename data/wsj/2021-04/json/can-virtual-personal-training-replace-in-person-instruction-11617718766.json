    "body": "For the recurring series That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and other emphatically opposed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />IN 2020, with gyms off-limits, Americans relied on home fitness, which gave rise to personal trainers who drilled us via our phones. For a fraction of the price of a premier gym membership or an in-person private trainer, new apps let homebound gym rats schedule personalized, one-on-one coaching at convenient times.<br />As you train, these apps can send real-time heart-rate data directly from your Apple Watch to your e-coach so she knows whether you’re pushing yourself or loafing. The apps also offer advice on pre- and post-workout nutrition plus nearly 24/7 access to your coach so you can shoot her questions when you’re working out solo.<br />But as we start to head back to the gym, are these remote trainers effective enough to replace weekly sessions with real-life coaches for good? Below, we argue both sides.<br />For the past three years, Eric Perry has been working out with a personal trainer in his pocket. Using the iPhone app Future (available from $150/month), the 38-year-old has access to a remote coach who prerecords personalized daily workouts for him to complete. “I don’t want my life to revolve around going to the gym,” the New Jersey graphic designer said. “I’d rather the gym revolve around my life.”"
