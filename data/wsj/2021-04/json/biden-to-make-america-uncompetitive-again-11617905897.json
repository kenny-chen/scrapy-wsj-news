    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Stumble in the Global Tax Race” (April 2): In the early 1990s I attended an evening graduate-degree program at U.C. Berkeley and my macroeconomics teacher was Prof. Janet Yellen. That was the most enjoyable class in the three-year program and she was by far the best teacher. In fact, I got an A+ in the class, the first and last such grade I received since fourth grade.<br />I vividly remember her telling us several times the well-understood truth that “corporations don’t pay taxes, they either pass them forward in higher prices or backward in lower wages,” and I’ve quoted this to others over the years, giving her full credit for the line.<br />Imagine my surprise when I read in your editorial that my former professor now says: “We’ve had a global race to the bottom in corporate taxation and we hope to put an end to that.”<br />Perhaps it’s time for Prof. Yellen to go back to Berkeley for a refresher in basic economic theory.<br />Cary Fulbright"
