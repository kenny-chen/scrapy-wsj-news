    "body": "In his famous book about the 1988 presidential campaign, journalist Richard Ben Cramer wrote that the then-young candidate Joe Biden believed from the outset of his career that his principal asset was less a governing program or philosophy, and more a gut feeling for voters: “He was so sure he knew where the people stood. They were like him, he was like them.”<br />More than three decades later, of course, that same Joe Biden became president. And as he prepared to appear before a joint session of Congress for the first time Wednesday night, that same gut feeling helps explain the considerable political gamble President Biden is taking in the program he has laid out.<br />Mr. Biden—seen widely as a moderate, and as the least revolutionary of the major Democratic candidates for president in 2020—is going big, bold and risky. He proposed on Wednesday his third expansive initiative in less than four months, a $1.8 trillion plan to provide universal preschool, cost-free community college education, significant government help for those seeking child care, and more.<br />That proposal comes atop the recently enacted $1.9 trillion coronavirus-relief and stimulus package and a $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal. Those plans require not just big and broad tax increases as well as larger deficits, at least in the short term; they also test Mr. Biden’s campaign assurances that he could find a way to work with Republicans and to bring the country together behind his governing style.<br />In short, Mr. Biden has chosen not just an ambitious agenda, but a perilous one as well. It’s a strategy rooted in that Biden belief that he understands the average folks to whom he refers often, and in a conviction that the shock of the yearlong coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis has left Americans persuaded that the country needs a Franklin Roosevelt-sized rebuild and reboot."
