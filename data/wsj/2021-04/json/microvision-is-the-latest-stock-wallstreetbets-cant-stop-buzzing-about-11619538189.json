    "body": "WallStreetBets may have just found its next  GameStop Corp.<br />Individual investors who hang out on the popular Reddit Inc. investing forum have been piling into shares of a little-known technology company, sending its stock catapulting. Shares of  MicroVision Inc.,  a developer of laser-beam scanning technology, have nearly doubled in the past week.<br />The recent surge builds on a stunning rally for the Redmond, Wash., company, which has jumped more than 7,600% in the past year after trading in April 2020 for less than $1. The stock closed Monday above $26 after rising 47% on the day. It pulled back Tuesday, losing 24% to close at $20.16.<br />The rapid move marks the latest example of individual investors’ growing influence in the market—and is reminiscent of GameStop’s stunning rise earlier this year. In circumstances similar to the saga surrounding the videogame retailer, much of the interest surrounding MicroVision recently has originated on WallStreetBets and then rippled across social media.<br />MicroVision didn’t respond to a request for comment."
