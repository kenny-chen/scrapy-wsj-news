    "body": "Regarding Daniel Yergin’s “The New World of AutoTech” (Review, April 24): I disagree that fewer cars will be needed. Cars may be parked most of the time, but there are spikes in use, most clearly during morning and evening commutes. Waiting for an available ride-sharing car to show up for your commute will be frustrating. Today, one car makes one trip and sits, waiting to return later. Unless there are enough ride-hailing cars to match user demand during peak times, those cars will make one trip, then have to return to fetch another commuter, inefficiently adding more trips. It is possible that ride-hailing will come to resemble buses, which would reduce the inefficiency but limit the convenience. And where will these peak vehicles reside waiting for the return commute?<br />Meanwhile, it’s hard to imagine families, especially those with young children, waiting for a ride-hailing minivan to show up, then spending 30 minutes installing the car seats, loading up the snacks, toys, diaper bag, arriving at the beach, unloading everything including the car seats, and then repeating the entire process when it is time to leave. The modern personal-transportation vehicle, whether it be gasoline or electric powered, has been a tool of freedom for generations.<br />Paul Dembry<br />Los Gatos, Calif.<br />"
