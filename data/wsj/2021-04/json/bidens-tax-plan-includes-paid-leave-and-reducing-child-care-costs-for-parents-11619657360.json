    "body": "On Wednesday, President Biden announced the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan. By raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, the plan includes an expansion of the child tax credit, paid parental leave and two years of tuition-free preschool and community college—game-changers for lower-income and middle-class families.<br />“What I like about this plan is connecting the dots,” said Jocelyn Frye, senior fellow with the Women’s Initiative at the Center for American Progress. Ms. Frye said recognizing the importance of child care and paid leave for people to stay in the workforce is “essential to how our economy functions.”<br />Below, some details how Mr. Biden’s plan could affect families’ finances.<br />Historically, women’s lifetime earnings have taken a hit when they drop out of the workforce to care for children, elderly parents or other caregiving responsibilities.<br />Mr. Biden’s proposal begins with three days of universal bereavement leave and ramps up to 12 weeks of paid parent, family and personal illness leave for all workers by the 10th year of the program. This program proposes providing two-thirds of average weekly wages up to $4,000 a month."
