    "body": "I love warm weather. Sunshine caressing my skin, evening walks wearing tank tops and shorts, bedroom windows open at night—so lovely and comfortable. For 30 years, I had lived in San Diego, which was never really hot enough for me. I had never been to Alaska, was not particularly interested in it, and was fairly sure that it would be the last of the 50 states I would visit.<br />So, why did I retire in Anchorage? What happened? Grandchildren. That’s what happened. When my son and his wife moved to Alaska, I thought it was just a phase. Surely, humans could not survive in the “Godforsaken frozen North” (a direct quote from my California sister). When my daughter moved up there also, I told myself it was just another phase.<br />When my husband and I paid our first visit, in the dead of winter, my feet froze; my arthritic hands throbbed painfully in my pitiful gloves. I was blind to anything positive and didn’t see any future for myself there. We were planning to retire in our beloved home in San Diego.<br />Then our daughter-in-law became pregnant, and she and our son honored us by asking us to become “involved grandparents.”<br />Goodbye, San Diego. Hello, Anchorage."
