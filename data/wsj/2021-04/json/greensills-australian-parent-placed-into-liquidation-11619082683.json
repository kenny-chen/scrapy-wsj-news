    "body": "SYDNEY—The Australian parent of Greensill was placed into liquidation following a meeting of creditors owed nearly $1.33 billion when the supply-chain finance business became insolvent last month.<br />The move to liquidate Greensill Capital Pty Ltd. was unopposed by the 23 creditors that joined a virtual meeting in Australia that ran for more than 90 minutes on Thursday. Three creditors abstained from the vote.<br />No buyers emerged for Greensill Capital, the parent company of more than 40 businesses, after it was declared insolvent, according to a creditor who attended the meeting.
