    "body": "DEHRADUN, India—The Covid-19 outbreak that has overwhelmed hospitals in New Delhi and Mumbai is spreading to states across India, as the world’s fastest-growing Covid-19 surge shows no signs of slowing.<br />The country hit a new global high for the pandemic on Wednesday reporting more than 360,000 new daily cases. It recorded 3,293 deaths, the highest single-day toll for the country.<br />New Delhi and Maharashtra, the state that is home to the country’s financial capital of Mumbai, account for about a quarter of India’s three million active cases. But cases are now rising fast elsewhere—in some of India’s largest and most populous states, including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. Those five states, with a combined population of over 500 million, now account for about 35% of the country’s active cases.<br />In the southern state of Kerala, the number of new cases being reported has risen to more than 30,000 a day, from around 13,000 two weeks ago. Hospitals there are beginning to see some of the same strains as those in New Delhi and Mumbai.<br />Since last week, there have been long lines at the KIMS hospital, a private facility in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram, said Dr. A. Rajalakshmi, senior consultant of infectious diseases at the hospital."
