    "body": "Hong Kong’s economy is finally turning the corner. But it could be years before the city’s once-lucrative office-rental market is back to full health.<br />Companies are scaling back to cut costs and to adapt to an era of flexible working. That has added strain to a market already roiled by the economic impacts of social unrest, U.S.-China tensions and the pandemic. And a series of new skyscrapers will open for business next year and in 2023, putting further downward pressure on prices.<br />“It’s survival of the fittest,” said Fiona Ngan, head of office services for Hong Kong at  Colliers International ,  adding that newer and better-managed properties had the advantage.<br />Ms. Ngan forecasts that rents for prime offices in Hong Kong’s downtown Central district will fall about 8% this year. Likewise, other property brokers surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect falls of between 5% and 10% for high-end rents in Central.<br />Already, rents have fallen steeply. In February, premium Central office rents went for the equivalent of about $12.70 a square foot a month, according to the most recent available government statistics, down 27% from the June 2019 peak. Rents fell about 10% in 2020."
