    "body": "Boeing Co.  on Tuesday cast a vote of confidence in Chief Executive David Calhoun by extending his job for up to five years and said it is searching for a new chief financial officer.<br />The leadership moves come as Boeing is under continued pressure stemming from two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX and plunge in demand for new airplanes amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The manufacturer’s commercial, defense and space divisions also face a host of quality problems, and Mr. Calhoun has presided over efforts to overhaul how Boeing handles engineering and safety matters.<br />Boeing said Greg Smith, who was considered as a potential successor to the top job, will retire in July after serving as CFO for a decade and briefly serving as interim CEO before Mr. Calhoun took over in January 2020.<br />Mr. Calhoun, 64 years old, will now face a new mandatory retirement age of 70, rather than the company’s typical age of 65. Mr. Calhoun, a director since 2009, is among Boeing’s longest-serving board members and served as lead director and chairman before becoming CEO last year.<br />Without the extension Mr. Calhoun would face retirement in April 2022. The company said Tuesday there wasn’t a fixed term with Mr. Calhoun’s employment. Chairman Larry Kellner said Boeing had “effectively navigated one of the most challenging and complex periods” in the company’s history during Mr. Calhoun’s tenure."
