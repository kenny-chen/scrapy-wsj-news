    "body": "U.S. stock futures rose ahead of earnings and fresh economic data that will indicate the state of consumer spending and the labor market.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 gained 0.5%. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. Futures for the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 were up 0.7%, indicating tech shares may recover some ground after the index fell 1.3% Wednesday.<br />Investors will be watching earnings to assess whether stocks can grind higher. Companies slated to report quarterly results ahead of the opening bell include  UnitedHealth Group ,   PepsiCo ,   Citigroup  and  Delta Air Lines .   Goldman Sachs Group  and  JPMorgan Chase posted record quarterly profit Wednesday.<br />An anticipated economic recovery has led some investors to buy shares of companies sensitive to a rebound, such as energy, travel and banks, which has helped send indexes to repeated record highs this year.<br />“We want to see that the 2021 numbers—even the 2022 numbers—are going to continue to look good,” said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Solutions. “We want to see what guidance is going to be. For a lot of 2020, we had no guidance.”"
