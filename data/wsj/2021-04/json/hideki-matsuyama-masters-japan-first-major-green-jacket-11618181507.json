    "body": "AUGUSTA, Ga.—Hideki Matsuyama had the weight of a golf-obsessed, yet championship-deprived country hovering over every shot at Augusta National Golf Club on Sunday as he sought to become the first man from Japan to win one of golf’s major championships.<br />And just when it looked like he was about to run away with this Masters, he flirted with a meltdown, putting a shot in the water and watching his five-shot lead shrink to two on the back nine.<br />But with a collection of Japanese fans following him, Matsuyama recovered and became the first Japanese man to win a major championship. He won by one stroke with a 10-under par performance for the tournament that overcame a serious wobble down the stretch.  He could finally exhale and slip into a green jacket.<br />The victory completed the rise of a 29-year-old who burst onto the scene at this very course a decade ago and became one of the sport’s bright young talents and one of Asia’s all-time greats even before this win that quickly vacillated between near certitude and epic disaster.<br />“Hopefully, I’ll be a pioneer,” Matsuyama said afterward."
