    "body": "Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), who helped shape the Republican tax overhaul of 2017, said Wednesday he wouldn’t run for re-election.<br />Currently the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Brady led the tax-writing panel for four years, including when Republicans lowered the corporate tax rate and reduced individual rates during the Trump administration.<br />“This term, my 13th, will be the last,” Mr. Brady said Wednesday in Texas. Term limits preventing him from leading the Ways and Means panel if Republicans take back the House next year played a part in his decision to retire, he said.<br />“As I see it, our committee leader term limits ensure lawmakers who work hard and eﬀectively have the opportunity to lead, to bring fresh ideas to our committee work. In my view, it’s a good thing,” he said.<br />After Mr. Brady, Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) has the most seniority among Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee, though seniority doesn’t always determine which lawmakers get chosen for top committee slots. Rep. Vern Buchanan (R., Fla.) is also considered a contender for the top spot, according to GOP aides."
