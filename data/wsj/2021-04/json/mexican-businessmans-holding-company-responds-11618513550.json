    "body": "“How Obscure Fertilizer Deal Enriched a Mexican Tycoon” (Page One, April 9) presents long-known, previously published elements. It rehashes a large series of disjointed events, attacking Ricardo Salinas Pliego’s reputation and his relationship with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.<br />We disagree with the portrayal of Grupo Fertinal as an “obscure manufacturer”; at the time of its sale it was a competitive and productive company, with exports to over 25 countries, global quality certifications and strong growth prospects. What happened next with Fertinal’s operations is the responsibility of its buyers, who laid off qualified personnel and dismantled its structure, putting an end to a growing business and condemning it to failure.<br />Luciano Pascoe<br />Grupo Salinas<br />Mexico City"
