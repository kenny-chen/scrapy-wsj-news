    "body": "SÃO PAULO—Brazilian health authorities rejected requests by Brazilian states for emergency approval to import the Russian-developed Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine, citing what it said was a lack of consistent and reliable data on quality control, safety and efficacy.<br />Health agency Anvisa said Monday that its directors voted unanimously not to recommend importing the vaccine after its researchers reported flaws in product development in all stages of the clinical studies for the vaccine.<br />The rejection comes as Brazil’s healthcare system has only recently managed to bring down from record highs the number of new infections and deaths from the illness while the country is working to ramp up its vaccination programs. The 14-day moving average for deaths reported from Covid-19 fell to about 2,670 as of Monday, after reaching 3,000 earlier in April.<br />Almost 39 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given to residents of the country, in a total population of just over 213 million people, but supply issues have slowed progress. Brazilian authorities are administering Covid-19 vaccines made by Chinese drugmaker Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and the shot developed jointly by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC.<br />Russia pushed back against Brazil’s decision, saying the regulator’s move was motivated by politics."
