The governor of Osaka, where the British variant of the virus has been quickly spreading, formally made the same request on Tuesday.<br />“We should not fall behind the speed at which variants of the virus are spreading infection,” said Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike.<br />Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga hinted he would grant the requests, saying he planned to make a judgment swiftly.<br />Asked whether a renewed state of emergency would affect the Olympics, which are scheduled to begin July 23, Mr. Suga said it wouldn’t."
