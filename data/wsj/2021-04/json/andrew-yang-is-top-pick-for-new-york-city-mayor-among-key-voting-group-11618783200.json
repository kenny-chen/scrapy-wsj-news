    "body": "New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang is the top choice among a crucial group of voters—registered Democrats age 50 and older, according to a poll released Sunday.<br />The poll, by Siena College Research Institute and senior-citizens’ group AARP, showed that 24% of Democrats in the age group say the former presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur is their first choice in the June 22 Democratic primary. This year’s mayoral primary is the first with ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to rank as many as five candidates.<br />Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams and New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who are also running for mayor in the Democratic primary, were each the first choice for 13% of Democrats age 50 and up, according to the poll.<br />Democratic candidate Ray McGuire, a former vice chairman at Citigroup, received 9% of first-choice votes from Democrats in this age category, and candidate Maya Wiley, a Democratic candidate and former legal counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio, had 7%, the poll showed.<br />Of the surveyed Democrats, 26% were still undecided. For Republican voters, 44% were undecided."
