    "body": "A contract manufacturing plant that is supposed to help make  Johnson & Johnson ’s  Covid-19 vaccine didn’t keep clean, sanitary conditions and failed to take proper steps to prevent contamination, federal health regulators said Wednesday.<br />Among the problems identified during the regulators’ inspection of the plant: cross-contamination of two different vaccines in production at the plant. Their names were redacted, but people familiar with the matter have said they are the Covid-19 vaccines from J&J and from  AstraZeneca  PLC.<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which inspected the plant owned by contract manufacturer  Emergent BioSolutions Inc.,  said it completed the inspection on Tuesday and would work with Emergent to address the findings from the inspection.<br />Production of J&J’s vaccine at the Emergent plant has been paused, and material already manufactured will undergo additional testing before it is released for potential distribution, the FDA said.<br />“We will not allow the release of any product until we feel confident that it meets our expectations for quality,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock and Peter Marks, who heads the FDA department overseeing vaccines."
