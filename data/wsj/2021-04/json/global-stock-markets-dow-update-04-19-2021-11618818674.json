    "body": "U.S. stock futures wobbled, suggesting major indexes will pause after notching records at the end of last week.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 fell 0.1%. Contracts linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2% and Nasdaq-100 futures wavered between gains and losses.<br />Investors started the week on a cautious note amid concerns that the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines was facing hiccups. A string of blue-chip companies are scheduled to report earnings this week, and will offer a view on businesses’ expectations for the pace of economic revival. Money managers are looking to gauge whether stocks’ high valuations are justified after the Dow and S&P 500 hit closing records last week.<br />“After a big move, you get a pause of breath and a bit of a reassessment,” said Caroline Simmons, U.K. chief investment officer at UBS Asset Management. “People are reassessing, waiting for newsflow that might indicate that growth and inflation remain on track.”<br />U.S. health authorities decided to recommend pausing the use of the  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine due to concerns about improper treatment of blood clots, The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend. Health officials are now looking at limiting the J&J vaccine to older people, among other options, and could make public a decision as early as this week."
