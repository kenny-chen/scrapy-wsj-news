    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s $1.8 trillion child-care and education plan complicates an already rocky legislative landscape on Capitol Hill, where Democratic leaders are balancing competing demands as they also juggle the White House’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure package.<br />With Republicans largely lining up against most of the roughly $4 trillion in proposed spending and related tax increases, Democrats face a series of political and logistical questions.<br />Among them: Should party lawmakers seek a compromise on narrower infrastructure legislation with the GOP, or plunge ahead with a Democratic plan that ignores Republicans’ concerns and can be passed on party lines? Should they expand the scope of the proposals even further? And should they attempt to pass several pieces of legislation or combine everything into one package?<br />“Well, I think the important thing to remember here is that the legislature writes the law,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii.). “So, what the executive branch is doing is offering a framework and then we’re going to do our job.”<br />House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has set a target of passing an infrastructure bill by July 4, leaving Democrats weeks of negotiations on the spending both with Republicans and among themselves. With both the House and Senate out of Washington through next week, it may still be several weeks before a path forward emerges."
