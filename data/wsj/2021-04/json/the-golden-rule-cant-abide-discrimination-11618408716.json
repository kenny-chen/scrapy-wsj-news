    "body": "As a former Republican congressman, a Christian and a member of the Conservatives Against Discrimination Leadership Council, I wish to respond to Margaret Harper McCarthy (“The Equality Act Is at War With Reality,” op-ed, March 31) by illustrating that strong religious convictions not only exist in tandem with support for nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ Americans, but also that they are intertwined.<br />Church leaders and devout followers of Christ from all walks of life are helping to lead the charge in protecting the most vulnerable. From a young age, we were taught to treat others as you would like to be treated. It’s a tenet of the convictions we are called upon to live by.<br />A report from the Public Religion Research Institute in March found that large majorities of religious groups favor nondiscrimination laws to protect the LGBT community. This includes 82% of white mainline Protestants, 81% of Hispanic Catholics, 78% of Mormons, 77% of white Catholics, 73% of Black Protestants and 62% of white evangelical Protestants. I am encouraged that this sentiment is growing inside the GOP, too.<br />Congress has an opportunity to use this groundswell of support to achieve consensus on federal nondiscrimination protections. I encourage my former colleagues to work with religious leaders to honor the Golden Rule.<br />Steve Gunderson"
