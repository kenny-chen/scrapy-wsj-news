    "body": "Uber Technologies Inc.  said it sees ride-hailing demand recovering faster than driver availability as Covid-19 vaccination rates increase in the U.S.<br />The company on Monday said its gross bookings for March rose to its highest monthly level in its nearly 12-year history. Uber’s mobility business, which includes ride-hailing, had its best month since March 2020, it said.<br />Uber overhauled its business during the health crisis, cutting about a quarter of its staff and shedding noncore businesses, among other moves, leading it to save $1 billion in fixed expenses last year.<br />The company said demand also continued to exceed courier availability for its meal-delivery business. The delivery business, combined with cost cuts, helped cushion the pandemic’s hit on Uber’s core ride-hailing operations during the pandemic, and the company posted a narrower full-year loss in February.<br />Uber said it is on track to reach profitability in quarterly adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization this year. The company earlier this month said it was spending $250 million in bonuses in an effort to boost driver availability in the near term."
