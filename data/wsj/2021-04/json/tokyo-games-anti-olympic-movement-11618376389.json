    "body": "TOKYO—Final preparation events for the summer Tokyo Olympics have been upended as local coronavirus cases rebound. The Japanese public remains opposed to the Games opening as planned in less than four months.<br />Anti-Olympic activist Misako Ichimura might be expected to be buoyant. But just like the organizers of the Games, she’s feeling under pressure to deliver.<br />“Activists in Paris opposing the next summer Olympics have asked why we haven’t already been able to stop the Games given the situation here,” she says.<br />It’s an unusual scenario for the anti-Olympics movement. Olympics held outside authoritarian countries almost always have protests over issues such as costs, corruption, and the impact on local communities and the environment. The Games still go ahead.<br />This time there’s a chance that won’t happen. On Friday, Tokyo told restaurants to close earlier to try to stem a rise in infections. The Olympic torch relay was held this week in an empty park instead of public streets in Japan’s third-largest city of Osaka as infections in and around the city reach the highest levels seen at any point during the pandemic."
