    "sub_head": "Broad bank lending to the real-estate sector, and developers’ access to bond markets, are both being squeezed; the companies are increasingly dependent on large deposits from home buyers",

    "body": "“Housing is for living, not for speculation,” has been a Chinese government mantra for almost half a decade. This year, it appears that slogan finally has teeth. But new restrictions on bank lending leave developers tapping a unique source of funding, which could have damaging consequences of its own.<br />Late last year, Chinese regulators announced that property lending should make up no more than 40% of banks’ total lending, effectively putting an end to years of steadily increasing exposure to real estate.<br />Looking across major Chinese banks’ results for 2020, they are very much at that limit in aggregate. At the big four—Bank of China,  China Construction Bank ,  Agricultural Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China—real-estate lending ran to between 37.5% and 42.2% of total loans, according to Capital IQ.<br />That adds to the squeeze on bond issuance from Beijing’s “three red lines” policy, which restricts further borrowing if developers don’t satisfy three leverage benchmarks. Most don’t, and issuance has eased to the smallest amount in three years in early 2021—down by a third relative to the same period in 2019—according to S&P Global Ratings.<br />That means a further shift to the last meaningful source of funding left, deposits direct from home buyers, is inevitable."
