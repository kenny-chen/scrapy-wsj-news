    "body": "THINK OF THIS salad as a love letter to Los Angeles in springtime. At Bridgetown Roti, chef Rashida Holmes serves dishes marrying the Caribbean flavors she grew up with to the region’s bounty of local produce.<br />A combination of smashed cucumbers and sugar snap peas with a jerk-spiced vinaigrette, Ms. Holmes’s second Slow Food Fast recipe draws on lessons gleaned in some of L.A.’s top kitchens. For example, she learned to smash cucumbers this way working beside chef Alex Chang at the Exchange (which has since closed), downtown. “It’s a Japanese technique,” she said. “Salting them draws out their water so they can better absorb the seasonings.”<br />Sugar snap peas are at peak sweetness right now, and Ms. Holmes considers making the most of seasonal ingredients a key takeaway from her years of working in L.A. “I go to the Santa Monica Farmers Market as much as possible,” she said. “Sugar snaps are one of my favorite parts of spring.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.<br />—Kitty Greenwald is a chef, food writer and the co-author of ‘Slow Fires’ (Clarkson Potter)"
