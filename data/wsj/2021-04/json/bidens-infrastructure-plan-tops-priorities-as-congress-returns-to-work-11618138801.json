    "body": "WASHINGTON—A crucial period of negotiations expected to determine the size and scope of President Biden’s infrastructure package will kick off this week on Capitol Hill, when lawmakers return from a two-week recess.<br />Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders have said they hope to secure GOP support for the $2.3 trillion infrastructure package the president unveiled late last month. Mr. Biden said last week he planned to meet with Republicans, beginning Monday, in an effort to see where common ground can be found. But Democratic leaders have also made clear they will be willing to move forward without GOP support and tap a process tied to the budget known as reconciliation, as they did earlier this year on a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.<br />“We hope to do this in the most bipartisan way possible,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) told reporters Thursday. “If we have to go to reconciliation, that’s a lever, but I hope it’s not something that we need to do.”<br />Bills using reconciliation in the Senate can advance with just a simple majority, rather than 60 votes.<br />Mr. Biden has said he wants the package to be bipartisan, while also keeping the door open to passing the bill on party lines. But some Democrats have also aired disagreements over the size and makeup of the proposal, meaning party leaders face a challenge keeping the rank and file in line."
