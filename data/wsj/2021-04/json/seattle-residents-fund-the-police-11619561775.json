    "body": "Just like people everywhere, even the residents of liberal Seattle are making it clear that they want law and order, enforced by police.<br />Gene Balk writes in the Seattle Times that the “defund the police” movement “gained more political traction in Seattle than it did in many other cities” in 2020. Adds Mr. Balk:<br />He’s describing the results of the annual Seattle Public Safety Survey conducted by researchers at Seattle University. But a close examination of the data suggests that the defunding movement never got much traction in Seattle either, outside of media and political circles.<br />When Seattle residents were asked last fall to select their top public safety priorities, the most popular categories were police capacity, property crime and homelessness. By “police capacity” respondents mean there are not enough officers in their neighborhoods and law enforcement responses are not fast enough, whether for emergency or non-emergency calls. Within the broad category of property crime is the overall number one concern across all categories: “car prowls,” meaning something being stolen from inside a car. Meanwhile in the quality-of-life category, “too many police in the neighborhood” ranked an overall 64th.<br />“People are saying they want more” not fewer police, Professor Jacqueline Helfgott, the study’s principal author, tells Seattle television station KOMO."
