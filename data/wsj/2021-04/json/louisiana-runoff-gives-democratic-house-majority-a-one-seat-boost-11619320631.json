    "body": "Louisiana lawmaker Troy Carter defeated Karen Carter Peterson, a fellow state legislator, in a runoff election for Congress that boosted the Democratic Party’s slim majority in the House.<br />The Associated Press called the contest for Mr. Carter, who led Ms. Carter Peterson by roughly 10 percentage points with more than 90% of precincts reporting. The pair of Democratic state senators from New Orleans earned spots in the runoff after leading a field of over a dozen candidates in March.<br />All candidates regardless of party competed against each other in the primary. No candidate topped 50% of the March vote, triggering Saturday’s runoff election. No Republican earned enough votes to advance to the runoff, so the seat was certain to remain in the Democratic column.<br />If Ms. Carter Peterson had won, she would have been the first Black woman elected to Congress from Louisiana.<br />Mr. Carter earned the early endorsement of former Rep. Cedric Richmond, whose vacated House seat was up for grabs after he joined President Biden’s administration as a senior adviser."
