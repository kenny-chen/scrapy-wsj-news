    "body": "Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey declared a state of emergency at the southwest border in Arizona and said the state would deploy 250 National Guard troops to help local law enforcement.<br />“The U.S. Border Patrol is overwhelmed. Local law enforcement and mayors are calling out for help,” the Republican said Tuesday in a recorded statement. “Citizens and our border communities are concerned for their safety and nonprofits, left to pick up the pieces of broken federal policies, are strained.”<br />Arizona is the first state to declare an emergency related to this year’s rapid increase in arrests of people crossing the border illegally. Border Patrol agents made about 168,000 arrests at the border in March, compared with about 71,000 in December.<br />The governor said the state would allocate $25 million to fund the National Guard mission. He didn’t say how long the deployment would last.<br />The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
