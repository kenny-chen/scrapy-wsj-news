    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Democratic-controlled House approved legislation Thursday that would make Washington, D.C., the 51st state, but the bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate amid broad Republican opposition and hesitation from some centrist Democrats.<br />Proponents cast the bill as a civil-rights priority, saying the city’s residents deserve full self-rule and representation in Congress. Critics call it a power grab by Democrats to gain two more senators and point to possible constitutional hurdles.<br />Thursday’s party line vote of 216-208 marks the second time the House has approved the measure, which is backed by the Biden administration. However, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) hasn’t committed to bringing it up for a vote in the Senate, where current rules require 60 votes for passage and only 45 of the 50 Democrats are currently sponsoring the legislation.<br />Asked at a press conference Thursday when he might bring the D.C. statehood bill to the Senate floor for a vote, Mr. Schumer didn’t answer directly.<br />“Look, D.C. statehood is something I strongly believe in,” he said. “We’re going to do everything we can to pass it.”"
