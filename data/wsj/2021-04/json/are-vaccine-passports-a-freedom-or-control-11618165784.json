    "body": "Regarding Martin Kulldorff and Jay Bhattacharya’s “Vaccine Passports Prolong Lockdowns” (op-ed, April 7): The authors’ idea is that the passport (valid at the most for six months without a booster shot) is a punishment scheme to deter bad behavior and will lead to a mad rush that will, perhaps unfairly, trample on the truly vulnerable. However, is it not possible for the opposite to be true, that is, this heavily time-limited passport is a temporary incentive rewarding responsible behavior and ensuring fairness by preventing some from free-riding on the immunity of others?<br />Prof. Subimal Chatterjee<br />Binghamton University, SUNY<br />Binghamton, N.Y.<br />"
