    "body": "Boeing ’s  big problem isn’t selling the infamous 737 MAX. It is delivering it.<br />On Wednesday, the Chicago-based plane maker’s shares fell almost 3% in morning trading after it reported a $561 million loss for the first quarter. While the defense business performed better than analysts anticipated, commercial-aircraft revenue once again came in well below expectations.<br />There are pockets of good news: Domestic travel in the U.S. staged a sudden recovery in March that is starting to percolate through the aviation industry. Boeing recorded 76 orders net of cancellations for the quarter, well ahead of its European rival  Airbus ,  which had 61 more cancellations than orders. Boeing’s tally included a high-profile deal for 100 737 MAX jets with  Southwest Airlines  that helps restore confidence in the beleaguered plane.<br />But the overall picture is dragged down by the U.S. plane maker’s hardships in shifting much of its massive stockpile of planes.<br />To meet investors’ expectations for 2021, Boeing needs to unload hundreds of undelivered jets that have accumulated on parking lots over the past two years as a result of the MAX crisis and recent problems with the 787 Dreamliner. Production costs for these planes have already been recorded, so every delivery is a big financial windfall."
