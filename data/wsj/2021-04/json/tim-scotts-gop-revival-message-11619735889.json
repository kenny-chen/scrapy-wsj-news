    "body": "The worst job in Washington is delivering the out-of-power party’s rebuttal to a President’s address to Congress. Invariably the poor soul looks small in comparison to a President addressing all branches of government and the American people from the well of the House.<br />Until Tim Scott.<br />On Wednesday the junior Senator from South Carolina offered the Republican response to Joe Biden’s the-era-of-very-big-government-is-back speech. He laid out what the GOP is against in the Biden agenda, but also what it is for, and the principles behind it. He also called out progressive hypocrisies, such as those who call him “Uncle Tom and the N-word” because he is a black Republican. Underscoring his point, that same night “Uncle Tim” was trending on  Twitter  until the platform shut it down Thursday.<br />The most electrifying moment came when he squarely addressed an issue now tearing the nation apart. “Hear me clearly,” Mr. Scott said. “America is not a racist country.”<br />Most Americans know this. But too many of our leaders are unwilling or afraid to say so publicly. He made clear he was not saying America is perfect, or that racism is totally behind us. Even as a Senator, he said, he knows what it’s like “to be pulled over for no reason” or “to be followed around a store while I’m shopping.”"
