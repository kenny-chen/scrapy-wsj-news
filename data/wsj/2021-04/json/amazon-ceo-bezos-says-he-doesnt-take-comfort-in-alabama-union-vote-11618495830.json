    "body": "Amazon.com Inc.  founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said the company needs a better vision for its employees after a recent vote among Alabama warehouse workers who rejected unionization.<br />“While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees—a vision for their success,” Mr. Bezos said in a letter to shareholders Thursday. Mr. Bezos added that he didn’t take comfort in the outcome.<br />More than 70% of Amazon employees in Bessemer, Ala., who cast ballots voted not to unionize last week, giving the tech company a victory in its biggest battle yet against labor-organizing efforts.<br />Mr. Bezos, who is set to step down as CEO in the third quarter and will remain chairman, also mentioned a few of Amazon’s pandemic-induced successes in the annual shareholder letter.<br />Spurred by record demand as lockdowns drew more people into online shopping, Amazon posted record profits, hired 500,000 workers and paid $91 billion in employee compensation. Mr. Bezos estimated that Amazon helped more than 200 million Prime members save $630 during the year. Small and midsize businesses account for almost 60% of its sales."
