    "body": "Silver Lake is investing about $800 million to take a minority stake in Abu Dhabi technology company Group 42, in a sign of the private-equity firm’s deepening relationship with the emirate, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />G42, as the company is known, offers artificial-intelligence and cloud-computing products aimed at digitizing enterprises across Abu Dhabi’s economy, and increasingly in other parts of the Middle East.<br />Its shareholders include Chairman Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the brother of Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, and Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co.<br />Silver Lake will be G42’s first Western investor and the buyout firm’s co-chief executive, Egon Durban, will join its board, the people said.<br />G42’s valuation couldn’t be learned, but its four largest segments—data platforms, cloud, healthcare and smart city—each had hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue, and the business is growing at a rapid clip, the people said."
