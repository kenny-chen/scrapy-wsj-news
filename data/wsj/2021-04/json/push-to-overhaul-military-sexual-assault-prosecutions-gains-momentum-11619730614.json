    "body": "WASHINGTON—A yearslong effort to change the way the U.S. military prosecutes sexual assault and other serious crimes is gaining new traction on Capitol Hill after a prominent Republican senator threw her support behind a bill that would strip commanders of their authority to decide whether to try such cases.<br />Under the plan backed by Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, a combat veteran and sexual-assault survivor, independent military prosecutors rather than commanders would decide if a case should go to trial. More than 55 uniquely military crimes, such as desertion, would remain under commanders’ purview, along with infractions punishable by less than a year of incarceration.<br />Under the proposal, if prosecutors decided not to pursue charges, they could send the case back to the commander to prosecute through a special court-martial, which has a 12-month cap on confinement, for any of the offenses related to an incident. That marked a change from past versions of the bill and was suggested by Ms. Ernst.<br />The Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act would mark a profound shift for the U.S. military, where commanders have wielded near-absolute power to mete out punishments within their ranks for more than 200 years.<br />“We need to foster a culture of respect and dignity within the military, and I think if there are perpetrators out there that feel that they exist within a command climate that doesn’t value people—they think they can get away with the crimes they are committing—well they have another thing coming now,” Ms. Ernst said."
