    "body": "To say that  Exxon Mobil  and  Chevron  faced a difficult 2020 would be a deep understatement. Their next challenge seems less daunting but could be trickier: Finding out what investors want.<br />Numbers tell the brutal year that was 2020. For the full year, the two giants’ total revenues declined by roughly 30% and their long-term debt burdens grew by roughly $20 billion each to levels not seen in the last two decades. No wonder the oil giants discussed a once-unthinkable merger last year.<br />By comparison, their first-quarter results look rather rosy. Exxon’s revenue and net income were higher than estimates from analysts polled by Visible Alpha; Chevron’s missed the mark largely due to weak downstream earnings. Both swung to net income after a year of being in the red and posted strong free cash flow: $3.4 billion at Chevron and roughly $6 billion at Exxon. That is quite the turn after a year of anemic free cash flow for Chevron and an outflow at Exxon. Despite the balance-sheet strain, both stuck to their promise of increasing dividends last year. Chevron already announced an increase this year.<br />Though higher oil prices are supporting the energy giants’ recovery, the pandemic’s effects linger. Downstream earnings were weak, partly because jet-fuel demand hasn’t fully recovered along with global travel.<br />Chemicals were the star performer at Exxon as strong plastics demand continued. The Texas winter storm was a mixed bag: At its peak, it knocked out roughly 75% of U.S. polyethylene capacity, including some Exxon plants, but that also had the effect of improving industrywide margins. Exxon’s first-quarter chemicals earnings were almost 10 times what they were a year earlier."
