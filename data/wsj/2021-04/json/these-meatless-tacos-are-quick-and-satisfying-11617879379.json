    "body": "IT TAKES A special sort of taco to pass muster at Chicago’s Mi Tocaya Antojería. “When I eat it,” said chef Diana Davila, “am I like, Damn, that’s delicious? It has to be as good as a great taco you’d eat on the street in Mexico. I also ask: Has it been seen before?”<br />Salsa-drenched tacos rojos are a regional specialty in the Davila family’s native city, San Luis Potosí, but little known stateside. In Ms. Davila’s final Slow Food Fast recipe, she shares her speedy take. Queso fresco brings richness and tang to the vegetarian carrot-potato filling. Pan-fried until lightly crisped, topped with more cheese, shredded cabbage, onions and sour cream, these tacos truly make a meal.<br />—Kitty Greenwald is a chef, food writer and the co-author of ‘Slow Fires’ (Clarkson Potter)<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page."
