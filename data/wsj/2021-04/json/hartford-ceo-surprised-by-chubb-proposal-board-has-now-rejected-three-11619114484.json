    "body": "Chubb Ltd. ’s March proposal to acquire rival Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. arrived with little warning, surprising Hartford’s chief executive officer.<br />On March 11, insurance company Chubb offered to buy Hartford in a roughly $23 billion transaction. After its board discussed the proposal, Hartford rejected the offer before the end of the month.<br />In an interview Thursday, Hartford CEO Christopher Swift said he received a quick head’s up from Chubb that an offer was coming. But there were no dinner meetings or other advance conversations about the potential pairing of two of the nation’s best-known property-casualty insurers.<br />He said the March offer was an impersonal start to what are now three proposals from Chubb to acquire Hartford. Each one has been evaluated and unanimously rejected by the insurer’s board.<br />“He wrote us three letters,” Mr. Swift said of Chubb’s chief executive, Evan Greenberg. “He didn’t ask to sit down with me ahead of time. He didn’t ask to meet. He gave me a head’s up one afternoon he was sending a letter.”"
