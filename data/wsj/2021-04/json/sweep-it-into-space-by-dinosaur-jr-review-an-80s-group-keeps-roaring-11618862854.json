    "body": "<br /><br /><br />In his 2001 book, “Our Band Could Be Your Life,” journalist Michael Azerrad tells the story of the American rock-music underground in the 1980s by focusing on the stories of 13 important groups from the decade. This was the era after the initial wave of punk rock but before the explosion of what came to be called alternative rock in the 1990s. Scanning the list of chapters now, one realizes that most of the featured outfits either split up years ago—noise-rockers Big Black, Minneapolis’s Hüsker Dü—or, like the Replacements, stopped making records, forming periodically to make some money playing festivals or on reunion tours. It’s difficult for any band to keep it together for 30-plus years, but it’s even harder for those at the margins, living from one gig to the next.<br />One act from Mr. Azerrad’s book, however, is not only active but making some of the best records of its career: Dinosaur Jr., the Amherst, Mass., trio fronted by singer and guitarist J Mascis, returns Friday with its 12th studio LP, “Sweep It Into Space” (Jagjaguwar). The strong new collection continues the group’s unlikely second act and holds its own among late-’80s classics."
