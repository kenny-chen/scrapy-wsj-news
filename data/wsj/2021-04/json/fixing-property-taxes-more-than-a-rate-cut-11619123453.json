    "body": "Thiru Vignarajah’s “Why Struggling Cities Should Cut Property Taxes” (Cross Country, April 17) is enlightening. But I am surprised he doesn’t address the greatest property-tax injustice of all: The principle of taxing a hypothetical capital gain on an investment that hasn’t been sold. If we treated stocks and bonds similarly, the appeal of those investments would disappear overnight.<br />When a property owner suffers a loss of value, such as during the housing bubble, he seldom receives much, if any, relief in assessed value. Some states assess every year, others every two or three years. In any event, they are being taxed on an unrealized, hypothetical gain. This violates a basic principle of investing. We should only pay tax on fully realized capital gains.<br />Ed Connor<br />Ormond Beach, Fla.<br />As a school-board member, I often heard taxpayers mention that property taxes “fall unfairly on the country’s poorest homeowners,” to quote Mr. Vignarajah. Those advocates for the poor were usually affluent homeowners urging across-the-board percentage cuts. Their “tax relief” would have disproportionately benefited owners of expensive homes. They never suggested a simpler approach: reducing the assessed value of homes by a fixed-dollar amount before computing the tax payable. Mr. Vignarajah doesn’t either."
