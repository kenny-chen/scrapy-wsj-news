    "body": "The pandemic has upended the business of daycare and fertility benefits. Some expect, though, the drag on growth will prove short-lived in the face of longer-lasting trends.<br />That’s kept some investors bullish on prospects for companies like daycare giant  Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc.  and fertility benefits provider  Progyny Inc.<br />Both companies have underperformed benchmark indexes so far this year. Shares in Bright Horizons are down about 4.9% in 2021 versus a gain of about 9% for the S&P 500. And while Progyny shares are up about 8%, they lag behind a roughly 13.5% gain for the Russell 2000.<br />This reflects the impact of the pandemic and economic downturn. Job loss and economic strain amid a global pandemic appears to have postponed some people’s decision to have children, while others have left the workforce to care for their kids. As a result of the pandemic, 300,000 fewer babies would be born in the U.S. in 2021 compared with last year, according to an estimate from the Brookings Institution.<br />“Some women who wanted to become mothers were facing a lot more unknowns last year because of the pandemic,” said Stephanie Davis, analyst at SVB Leerink, who nonetheless has a buy rating on Progyny."
