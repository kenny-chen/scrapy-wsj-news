    "body": "Household income likely rose at a record pace in March as federal-stimulus checks helped fuel an economic revival that is poised to endure with an easing pandemic.<br />Economists expect household income—the amount Americans received from wages, investments and government programs—rose 20% in March from the previous month. That would mark the largest monthly increase for government records tracing back to 1959. The expected surge reflects $1,400 stimulus checks and other government aid included in a $1.9 trillion fiscal relief package signed into law in March.<br />Economists also project that income growth pushed up consumer spending by 4% last month, which would be the steepest month-over-month increase since last summer. Widespread vaccinations and the broader reopening of the economy will help the recovery endure after the effects of fiscal stimulus fade, economists say.<br />“If we have Covid-19 cases under control, that would ideally make way for us to reopen the services sector of the economy,” said Pooja Sriram, U.S. economist at Barclays. “That, in fact, is a crucial aspect of ensuring that this recovery continues.”<br />Stimulus payments included in the latest package propelled spending the most of all three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks, according to data-analytics company Earnest Research."
