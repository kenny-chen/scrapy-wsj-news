    "body": "A  Goldman Sachs  & Co. analyst has been barred from the broker-dealer industry by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for insider trading, the regulator said Tuesday.<br />Brian Maguire, formerly an analyst at Goldman, bought shares in two different companies—once last April and once last June—after finding out through internal emails that another analyst was upgrading his recommendation on those firms to “buy” from “neutral,” Finra said.<br />In April, Mr. Maguire bought 2,000 shares of one company for around $128,000. In June, he bought 29,000 shares of another company for nearly $722,000.<br />The stock upgrades had been approved internally at the time Mr. Maguire bought his shares but he did so ahead of publication of the upgrades, Finra said. The regulator didn’t disclose the companies in question.<br />Finra, Wall Street’s regulatory organization, also said that Mr. Maguire traded securities of issuers that he covered and sold issuers’ securities when he rated them as a “buy” in his research. He also wrote research reports and didn’t disclose that a household member had a financial interest in the issuers’ securities, which is against Finra regulations, the regulator said."
