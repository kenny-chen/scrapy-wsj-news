    "body": "Your editorial “Biden’s Afghan Exit” (April 14) quotes the U.S. Treasury’s acknowledgment that al Qaeda is “gaining strength in Afghanistan while continuing to operate with the Taliban under the Taliban’s protection.” Clearly, our current strategy is not having its intended effect. Every year, security in the region becomes worse, not better. Leaving 4,500 troops would be enough to maintain the mission, but it doesn’t offer a path to success.<br />Since 2001 we have spent trillions of dollars and, more importantly, lost thousands of American lives in Afghanistan. I ask all critics of withdrawal: How many more years would you keep us there? What is your measure of success? How do you achieve that?<br />We should reallocate resources to send Beijing and Moscow a clear message: America is not retreating from its global commitments; it is refocusing time and resources to confront them more effectively.<br />Rep. Chris Stewart (R., Utah)<br />Washington"
