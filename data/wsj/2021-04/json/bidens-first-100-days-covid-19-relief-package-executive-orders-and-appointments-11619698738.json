    "body": "In his first 100 days, President Biden has signed into law a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, proposed trillions of dollars more in spending and issued dozens of executive orders.<br />Here’s a look at his first few months in office by the numbers:<br />Mr. Biden successfully pushed through Congress the Covid-19 relief law, which included $1,400 payments for many Americans, and now he is seeking more than $2 trillion for infrastructure improvements and $1.8 trillion for family-related programs such as child care, education and paid leave. Mr. Biden says those proposals are aimed at boosting the U.S. economy, creating jobs and helping people return to work after the pandemic.<br />Several of Mr. Biden’s predecessors also introduced signature plans to create jobs and stimulate the economy early in their term. Compared with their proposals, Mr. Biden’s three packages would cost the most.<br />Mr. Biden, like some predecessors, came into office during a period of economic turbulence, with the unemployment rate at 6.3% in January, before falling slightly in subsequent months. The American Rescue Plan Act, the Covid-19 relief law signed earlier this year, is projected to help push the jobless rate as low as 3.2% in late 2021 and early 2022, according to a report from Brookings Institution economists."
