    "body": "The 93rd Oscars ceremony will take place this Sunday evening, April 25, in Los Angeles. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science plans to honor filmmaking from the past year in an in-person—but safely distanced—event.<br />Producers of the ceremony initially hoped to have the honors handed out—and received—only in person. However, given Covid-19 risks and the challenges of international travel, the Academy appears to be open to acceptance speeches from hubs in London and Paris by winners who can’t make it to Los Angeles.<br />Below are a list of the nominations, when and how to watch, information on the hosts and red carpet, plus everything else you need to know about the ceremony. To read more about why the Oscars are happening away, read our guide for skeptics.<br />The big Oscars awards ceremony is Sunday, April 25, 2021, at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The show itself will take place at Union Station Los Angeles—where nominees, presenters and guests will convene—and the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood—where performances will happen.<br />The Oscars will air live on Sunday, April 25, 2021, on ABC, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern Time (5 p.m. Pacific Time). Using your TV provider, you can stream the show on ABC’s website or app. Other streaming options include YouTube TV and Hulu+Live TV."
