    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan said Tuesday that it has ordered all nonessential staff to leave the country, as concerns mount about an escalation in violence after the Taliban’s May 1 deadline for all troops to withdraw expires next week.<br />Under the terms of the U.S. deal signed with the Taliban last year, all U.S. troops and contractors were to leave by May 1 in return for security guarantees by the group. President Biden said this month that the U.S. would completely withdraw by Sept. 11.<br />The Taliban have threatened to escalate attacks if the U.S. misses the May 1 deadline. It wasn’t immediately clear how many U.S. staff would leave Afghanistan in the coming days, or how many would stay behind.<br />“We do not anticipate any changes to our operations,” the acting U.S. ambassador, Ross Wilson, said on Twitter.<br />U.S. officials have said they are urging the Taliban to refrain from attacking U.S. or Afghan forces as the U.S. and its allies withdraw. If the Taliban allows the U.S. to leave peacefully, all U.S. military forces are expected to be out by early summer, according to U.S. officials."
