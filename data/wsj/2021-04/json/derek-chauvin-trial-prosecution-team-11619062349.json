    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS—Days after Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison took over the prosecution of Derek Chauvin, he made his first big decision—charging the former Minneapolis police officer with second-degree murder in George Floyd’s death.<br />The charge carried a maximum of 40 years in prison and showed Mr. Ellison wanted to send a message that, after decades of police rarely being charged, let alone convicted for in-custody deaths, this case would be handled differently. It raised the stakes, heightening the possibility of losing on a tougher charge, or getting a mixed verdict, legal observers said.<br />Mr. Chauvin’s conviction Tuesday on all counts showed how a series of risks taken by Mr. Ellison paid off.<br />Mr. Ellison assembled a prominent group of outside attorneys to handle the case along with local prosecutors and his staff. He said they dispelled concerns that lawyers from different offices would butt heads instead of gel as a team.<br />It proved effective to build the case around an array of video showing Mr. Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Mr. Floyd’s neck and back, even though it also showed Mr. Floyd, who is Black, resisting getting into a squad car during an arrest attempt. And they confronted the case’s biggest apparent vulnerability—Mr. Floyd’s health and drug use—through medical testimony that pointed to Mr. Chauvin’s actions as a substantial causal factor in his death."
