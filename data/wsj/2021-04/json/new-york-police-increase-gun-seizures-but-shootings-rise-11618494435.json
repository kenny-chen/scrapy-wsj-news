    "body": "New York City police have seized more guns so far this year than any other period since 1996, but those efforts aren’t stemming a surge in shootings and homicides that began during the Covid-19 pandemic, police officials said.<br />Investigators say they are concerned by a rise in firearms on city streets and a continued stream of guns being illegally smuggled into the state from the South.<br />“There are absolutely more guns being carried and being used in New York City,” said Michael LiPetri, the New York Police Department’s chief of crime control strategies, in an interview Wednesday. “We see multiple guns at scenes more, and more than I’ve ever seen.”<br />Police investigators believe gang activity is driving the increase in shootings, Chief LiPetri said, and the majority of the NYPD’s gun arrests are related to crews in parts of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.<br />“We are putting more and more officers in the areas that see the most violence,” Chief LiPetri said."
