    "body": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday unveiled new initiatives aimed at reducing an uptick in gun violence that has plagued the city over the past year.<br />The initiative, dubbed “Safe Summer NYC,” focuses on community investment, redeploying police officers and improvements within the court system, the mayor said at a press conference.<br />“We know that investing in our young people makes a huge difference,” the mayor said. “We know that part of the strategy to keep people safe, an essential part, is bringing community and police together.”<br />The announcement comes as the city grapples with a surge of gun violence unlike anything it has seen in the last 20 years, after bringing crime down to record lows.<br />Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic as one reason for the increase. Police officials have also pointed to gangs and youth-lead crews for many of the shootings."
