    "body": "The silence will have set in by now.<br />Queen Elizabeth II sat by herself on Saturday at the funeral of her husband, removed from her family members because of Covid restrictions. There had been music during the procession, and bells, and the sound of marching feet, but now, with only 30 guests permitted in the cavernous chapel, her eyes peered over the top of the obligatory mask and she had to know, as she has always known, that millions of other eyes were staring back.<br />She has long been required to share every public moment with the world, so there she was, doing it again, as her husband of more than 73 years was taken from her presence for the last time. In the U.K. there was a moment of silence observed for him, and by extension for her, but she was certainly aware that the real silence lay ahead.<br />Anyone who has lost a longtime husband or wife understands. Any adult child who has sat with a father or mother at the funeral for the spouse who is being laid to rest knows what that impending silence feels like.<br />And it makes no difference whether you were born into royalty, or in a rural shack. Elizabeth and Philip were wed in 1947 and lived amid grandeur and renown. But no one is powerful enough to keep the silence at bay. When the husband or wife of a lifetime is gone, that silence can seem loudest when you are surrounded by others."
