    "body": "TikTok has named Shou Zi Chew, chief financial officer of parent company ByteDance Ltd., to lead the buzzy short-form video app, in a reshuffling that attempts to stabilize the leadership ranks of the fast-growing company.<br />Mr. Chew is stepping in as CEO of TikTok, while also continuing as ByteDance’s finance chief, the company said in a blog post Friday.<br />He replaces Vanessa Pappas, a former executive of  Alphabet Inc.’s  YouTube who will shift into an operating chief role at TikTok. Ms. Pappas became TikTok’s interim head in August after the abrupt resignation of former  Walt Disney Co.  executive Kevin Mayer. The company said Ms. Pappas, who joined TikTok in 2018, will maintain her current responsibilities including managing TikTok’s key operations.<br />Mr. Chew, who is based in Singapore, will steer TikTok at a time of growing influence for the social-media platform, where users can post short videos and scroll endlessly through other viral videos. He joined ByteDance last month after working at  Xiaomi Corp.  since 2015 and spent most of his tenure with the Beijing-based smartphone maker as finance chief.<br />TikTok has been at the center of a geopolitical standoff between the U.S. and China for more than a year. The new appointment appears to mark a pivot from initiatives last year aimed at TikTok distancing itself from its Chinese roots, and casts doubt on efforts to put parts of the company in U.S. hands."
