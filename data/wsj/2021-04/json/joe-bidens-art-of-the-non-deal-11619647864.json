    "body": "At 100 days, 90% of Joe Biden’s presidency can be summed up in one sentence: Whatever Donald Trump did, do the opposite.<br />The reversals have come on taxes, energy, Iran, climate, regulation, the border, the police and press conferences.<br />And one more thing. Mr. Trump famously wrote “The Art of the Deal.” Joe Biden is perfecting the art of the non-deal.<br />A hallmark of Mr. Biden’s governing style so far is that the longtime member of the U.S. Senate hasn’t done a deal with anyone. On any given issue, he or the people who do most of the talking for him say they are willing to negotiate. But then they don’t. He’s issued more than 60 executive orders and memos already.<br />In February, 10 moderate Republican senators trooped into the Oval Office to seek a compromise with their old chum over his proposed $1.9 trillion “Covid relief” bill. They trooped out with nothing. A day later, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer began the Biden spending avalanche by using budget reconciliation rules."
