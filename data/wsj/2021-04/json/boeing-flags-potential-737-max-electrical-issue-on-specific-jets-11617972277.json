    "body": "Boeing Co.  said it has flagged a potential electrical issue in certain 737 MAX aircraft, asking 16 customers to address it before further operations.<br />The disclosure of the possible flaw comes as the U.S. late last year approved the company’s 737 MAX airplanes for passenger flights again after dual crashes killed 346 people. The troubled jets had been grounded since March 2019.<br />Boeing on Friday said it is working with the Federal Aviation Administration on the production issue and has informed customers of specific tail numbers. The company will provide guidance on corrective actions, it said.<br />The company said it has asked those customers to verify “that a sufficient ground path exists for a component of the electrical power system.”<br />Accident investigators have said misfires of an automated flight-control system, called MCAS, led to the crashes of Indonesia’s Lion Air in October 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines in March 2019, when regulators grounded the MAX world-wide. Boeing spent the past few years hammering out fixes to the system, revising pilot training and making related changes while responding to demands from world regulators."
