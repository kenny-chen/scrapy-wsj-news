    "body": "Jeffrey Sonnenfeld’s “CEOs Lead America’s New Great Awakening” (op-ed, April 16) purports to tell a heroic tale of the Yale dean’s corralling business leaders to stand against the forces of darkness. (After all, the Georgia voting bill was “drafted in the dark of night.”) But here is the sum total of information Mr. Sonnenfeld provides about the bill: “Among the law’s antidemocratic features, it authorizes partisan legislators to dismiss the authority of elected county voting officials and override the elected secretary of state to decide, at will and after an election, whose ballots count.”<br />That is not what the law does. It empowers the State Election Board to conduct performance reviews of county voting officials, who can be removed only if an investigation finds either three clear violations of State Election Board rules or “demonstrated nonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence in the administration of the elections” in two consecutive elections. But nowhere in the Georgia law did I see any provision for state legislators to override any other elected officials to determine “whose ballots count.”<br />Kevin Connors<br />Easton, Md.<br />"
