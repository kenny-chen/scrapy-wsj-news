    "body": "TORONTO—Canada’s West Coast province of British Columbia is struggling to contain the spread of a highly contagious coronavirus variant that originated in Brazil, and epidemiologists say the country’s relatively slow vaccination rollout could leave it vulnerable to a wider spread.<br />The spread of the so-called P.1 Covid-19 variant has forced the closure of the popular Whistler Blackcomb ski resort north of Vancouver, and the growing number of Covid-19 cases temporarily benched the city’s National Hockey League team, the Vancouver Canucks. Over the past month, 737 cases of P.1 have been identified in British Columbia, according to the province. Of those infected people, 215 remain ill.<br />“Obviously, we’re concerned,” said Adrian Dix, the province’s health minister, on Monday. It is likely that the province is doing more testing for the variants than other jurisdictions—including Brazil—which could help explain its relatively high P.1 case counts, he said.<br />Canada, which is vaccinating people at a slower pace than the U.S., the U.K. and Israel, could suffer a worsening situation nationwide.<br />“All of [the models] say that the growth of these variants is too fast relative to the vaccine rollout,” said Sarah Otto, a professor in the University of British Columbia’s zoology department."
