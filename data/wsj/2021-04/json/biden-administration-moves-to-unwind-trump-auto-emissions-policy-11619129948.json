    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. Transportation Department said it was moving to end a legal battle with California over the state’s authority to regulate tailpipe emissions, setting the stage for the Biden administration to impose tougher fuel standards nationwide.<br />President Biden had promised tougher fuel standards as a candidate in his platform for addressing climate change. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the move was expected this week.<br />“The transportation sector is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gases in our economy—which means it can and must be a big part of the climate solution,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement announcing the move. He said it would also be important for protecting public health.<br />Under the action outlined Thursday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is proposing to withdraw portions of a rule, approved under the Trump administration, to pre-empt states including California from issuing their own limits on greenhouse-gas emissions from tailpipes and their own mandates on zero-emissions vehicles.<br />The NHTSA, which is an arm of the Transportation Department, cited concerns that Trump administration action had exceeded the agency’s legal authority."
