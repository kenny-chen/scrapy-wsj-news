Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York said he also falsely claimed personal expenses as business expenses.<br />Mr. Deutsch, 52 years old, was first elected in 2014 and for part of his time in office he was the sole owner of Chasa Management Inc., a real-estate-management business, prosecutors said.<br />The councilman faces up to a year in prison and will have to pay restitution for unpaid taxes, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.<br />His lawyer, Henry Mazurek, said in a statement that Mr. Deutsch would repay the taxes he owes. “Mr. Deutsch’s dedication to public service will not be diminished, and he looks forward to completing his elected term,” Mr. Mazurek said."
