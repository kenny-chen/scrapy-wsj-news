    "body": "Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />The latest internet trend is uniting such disparate worlds as art, sports, music and gaming in an investment frenzy: “nonfungible tokens,” or “NFTs” for short.<br />NFTs are a kind of digital asset that results from using the technology that powers cryptocurrency to make unique tokens, each with its own identification that can’t be replicated. They serve as a kind of deed proving ownership for original editions of various digital artifacts—whether works of art, sports collectibles or music albums. Even a tweet can be monetized with an NFT:  Twitter  founder Jack Dorsey auctioned off his first post to the site for $2.9 million.<br />In the three initials that make up the name, the N for “non” and the T for “token” are straightforward enough, but what about that F for “fungible?” It takes a term long known in economics and updates it for 21st-century digital natives.<br />What makes NFTs special is that each one represents something unique, and not interchangeable with anything—in other words, not “fungible.” That distinguishes them from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which are fungible—interchangeable—even though they use the same blockchain technology as NFTs."
