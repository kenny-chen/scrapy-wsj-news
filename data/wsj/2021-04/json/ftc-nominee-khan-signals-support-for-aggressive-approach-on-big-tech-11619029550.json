    "body": "WASHINGTON—Lina Khan, a Big Tech critic nominated to a seat on the Federal Trade Commission, appeared on track to win confirmation after a hearing Wednesday showed she has broad Democratic support—and might win some Republican votes.<br />Ms. Khan, a liberal law professor and former congressional staffer who co-wrote a House report concluding that large online platforms can harm consumers, signaled support for a more aggressive approach from the FTC when it comes to digital markets for news, smartphone apps and more.<br />Under questioning from Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Ms. Khan expressed support for an FTC review of the impact that  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and  Facebook Inc.  have had on the journalism industry.<br />“Everything needs to be on the table. Obviously local journalism is in crisis,” Ms. Khan said. “Increasingly, news publishers are dependent on a few gatekeepers to disseminate their news.”<br />Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) asked Ms. Khan about large technology companies’ market power and then told her: “I look forward to working with you.”"
