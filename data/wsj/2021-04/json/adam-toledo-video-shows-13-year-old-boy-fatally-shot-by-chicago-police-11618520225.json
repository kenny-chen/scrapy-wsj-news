    "body": "CHICAGO—City leaders urged calm after officials released video Thursday of Chicago police fatally shooting 13-year-old Adam Toledo, as he turned to surrender after a foot chase in an alley at the end of March.<br />Police said an officer killed the teenager in the early morning hours of March 29, as police responded to a ShotSpotter alert of shots fired in the area. The killing set off protests and demonstrations in the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood of Little Village.<br />The officer involved hasn’t been named and has been placed on administrative leave.<br />The Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which is investigating, released the video in consultation with the city and the boy’s family.<br />It shows an officer chase someone down an alley and yell repeatedly for the boy to stop. As he did so, the officer yelled, “Show me your f— hands.” The boy turned toward the officer with arms raised and nothing in his hands. The officer yelled, “Drop it, drop it,” and immediately fired a single shot before rushing over."
