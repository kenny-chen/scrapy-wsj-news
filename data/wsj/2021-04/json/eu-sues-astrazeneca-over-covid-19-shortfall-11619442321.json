    "body": "The European Union is suing  AstraZeneca  PLC for failure to deliver on its Covid-19 vaccine contract, the bloc’s health commissioner said, the latest development in a long-simmering dispute between the two sides over vaccine supplies.<br />“Our priority is to ensure #Covid-19 vaccine deliveries take place,” Stella Kyriakides said on Twitter.<br />AstraZeneca said it regretted the European Commission’s decision to take legal action and was looking forward to working with the EU’s executive arm “to vaccinate as many people as possible.”<br />The commission said last week it was preparing a lawsuit against the U.K. pharmaceuticals giant. The commission and AstraZeneca have wrangled all year, since the company said it would be able to deliver only a fraction of the up to 400 million doses it was contracted to deliver by midyear.<br />A commission spokesman said Thursday that the EU was “keeping all our options open, including legal options.”"
