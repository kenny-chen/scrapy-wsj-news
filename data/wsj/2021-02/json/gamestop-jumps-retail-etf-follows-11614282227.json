    "body": "The latest jump in GameStop Corp. shares is pushing a widely traded retail exchange-traded fund up, too, despite the broad-market tumble Thursday.<br />Shares of State Street’s  have risen more than 5% over the past two days, riding a wave of gains from GameStop, the fund’s biggest holding. Assets have followed, with investors plowing more than $100 million of fresh cash into the fund, pushing assets close to $800 million, according to FactSet.<br />It is the latest move for a fund that has found itself closely tied to the GameStop saga. The ETF, which goes by the ticker XRT, was up as much as 42% on Jan. 27 after GameStop shares soared 135% that day alone. The next day, XRT tumbled nearly 10% as GameStop’s rally relented.<br />The fund ended up losing $506 million in assets, representing three-quarters of its total assets at the time. Redemptions were driven in part by wide discounts between the ETF’s share price and net asset value and a desire to get a hold of GameStop shares held by the fund, traders said.<br />The drama has reshaped XRT’s profile to some extent. The fund offers a way for investors to bet on a swath of the retail sector, typically offering roughly equal exposure to GameStop as to the likes of  Amazon.com Inc.,   Macy’s Inc.  and  Kohl’s Corp."
