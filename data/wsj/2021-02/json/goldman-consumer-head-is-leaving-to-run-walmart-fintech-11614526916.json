By the end of last year, that business generated $1.2 billion in annual revenue, had amassed $97 billion in deposits and held $8 billion in consumer-loan balances.<br />Walmart said in January that it was creating a majority-owned fintech subsidiary in a partnership with venture-capital firm  Ribbit Capital ,  a backer of Credit Karma Inc.,  Affirm Holdings Inc.  and other fast-growing startups.<br />“Our customers have been clear that they want more from us in terms of financial services,” Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at an investor event earlier this month. “This new approach will help us deliver for them in a differentiated way more quickly.”"
