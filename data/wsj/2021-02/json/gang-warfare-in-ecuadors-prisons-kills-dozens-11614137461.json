    "body": "Dozens of Ecuadorean inmates were killed Tuesday in a bloody confrontation between rival gangs in three prisons fighting for control of the facilities, the government said.<br />The riots broke out in a prison in the coastal city of Guayaquil, as well as in two others in the provinces of Cotopaxi and Azuay, said Edmundo Moncayo, the head of Ecuador’s penitentiary agency. At least 62 prisoners were killed, he said, in the country’s worst such violence in recent memory.<br />President Lenin Moreno said that 800 police officers were sent to regain control and that the military was deployed outside the prisons. About 20 police officers were injured, authorities said.<br />Latin America’s notoriously overcrowded prisons are hotbeds for deadly riots and bloody fights between gangs. Violent gangs from Mexico to Colombia and Brazil often battle for control inside prisons, which they use to orchestrate drug trafficking and other criminal activities on the outside.<br />In Ecuador, Tuesday’s violence, which inmates recorded with cellphones, rattled a nation that has seen an increase in prison violence in recent years."
