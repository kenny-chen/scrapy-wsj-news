    "body": "The U.S. government has sold an exclusive Hong Kong property for $332 million, after a holdup while it sought permission from Beijing for the deal.<br />Hong Kong developer Hang Lung Properties Ltd. said Thursday that it had closed its purchase of the former residential compound for U.S. consulate staff. Hang Lung, which is controlled by billionaire Ronnie Chan, said last week that China had given the U.S. its written consent.<br />The deal was originally set to conclude on Dec. 30. However, the Chinese government stepped in, saying its approval was needed because the deal wasn’t an ordinary commercial transaction but involved foreign affairs between the U.S. and China.<br />The compound, in a high-end neighborhood called Shouson Hill, comprises six low-rise buildings with 26 apartments and a rooftop swimming pool. The U.S. government bought the property in 1948, when Hong Kong was under British rule.<br />Hang Lung has said it planned to invest the equivalent of about $516 million, including the purchase price. It aims to finish redeveloping the site by 2024."
