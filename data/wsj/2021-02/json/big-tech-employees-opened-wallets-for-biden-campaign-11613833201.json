    "body": "WASHINGTON—Employees of big technology firms were a key source of contributions for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, newly released campaign finance records show, eclipsing donations from employees at traditional Democratic fundraising sources such as banks and law firms.<br />Employees of Google’s parent,  Alphabet Inc.,  and  Microsoft Corp. ,  Amazon.com  Inc.,   Apple Inc.  and  Facebook Inc.  were the five largest sources of money for Mr. Biden’s campaign and joint fundraising committees among those identifying corporate employers, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign finance reports.<br />Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign received at least $15.1 million from employees of those five tech firms, records show. The companies declined to comment.<br />The previous Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also received large contributions from tech company employees, but their top sources of employee donations extended beyond the tech sector.<br />Mrs. Clinton’s biggest sources of funds from those identifying corporate employers in 2016 included employees of the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan and  JPMorgan Chase  & Co., along with Google, Microsoft and Apple, according to election records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics."
