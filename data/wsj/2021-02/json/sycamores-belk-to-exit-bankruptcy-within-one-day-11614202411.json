    "body": "Department store chain Belk Inc. won bankruptcy-court approval to cut $450 million in debt, emerging from a prepackaged chapter 11 case less than 24 hours after it was filed.<br />After filing for chapter 11 protection on Tuesday, Belk won approval for its restructuring plan early Wednesday from Judge Marvin Isgur in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. Belk’s sprint through chapter 11 was the one of just a handful of cases that were completed in under 24 hours.<br />Prepackaged bankruptcy filings are popular because they take less time and cost less in administrative and professional fees. But superfast bankruptcies like Belk’s are rare. Only a handful of companies have been able to go in and out of bankruptcy in a 24- or 48-hour time frame, including catalog retailer Fullbeauty Brands Inc., which set the previous record in 2019 for the least time between the filing of a chapter 11 petition and confirmation of an exit plan.<br />Bricks-and-mortar retailers often spend more time in chapter 11 because they have dozens of landlords and typically use the bankruptcy process to negotiate lower rents and close chunks of their store base.<br />Charlotte, N.C.-based Belk, however, is using bankruptcy solely to restructure its debt while paying vendors in full and assuming the leases at its 291 stores, all of which are staying open, according to court papers."
