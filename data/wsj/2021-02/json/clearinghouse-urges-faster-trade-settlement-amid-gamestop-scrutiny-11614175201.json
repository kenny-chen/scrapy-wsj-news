    "body": "The clearinghouse operator whose $3 billion margin call spurred Robinhood Markets Inc. to limit trading in  GameStop Corp.  is urging an overhaul of the stock market’s plumbing that could reduce the risk of such a scenario repeating.<br />The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. said in a report on Wednesday that Wall Street should speed up the time it takes to settle securities trades to one day from two, and it called for a broad effort by the industry and regulators to achieve that goal by 2023.<br />In an interview, a DTCC executive said the report was in the works months before the dramatic Reddit-fueled rally in GameStop. Still, the report’s release comes as the DTCC faces an unusual degree of attention because of its role in the GameStop frenzy.<br />Last week, lawmakers from the House Financial Services Committee grilled Robinhood Chief ExecutiveVlad Tenev over his firm’s controversial decision to restrict trading in GameStop on Jan. 28. The trading limits came at the peak of the stock’s rally, infuriating many Robinhood customers, and they punctured the huge speculative run-up in GameStop.<br />Mr. Tenev said Robinhood’s hand was forced by the DTCC’s huge margin call, and he called for a shake-up of the clearinghouse’s processes to reduce the burdens that they place on brokers."
