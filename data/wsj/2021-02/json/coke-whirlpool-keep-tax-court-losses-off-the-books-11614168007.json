    "body": "When court rulings and tax regulations go against them, companies have an effective way to minimize or defer the bottom-line costs. They don’t count them, and announce that they will beat the government in the future.<br />Coca-Cola Co. ,  Whirlpool Corp.  and  Eaton Corp .  have all lost to the Internal Revenue Service in the U.S. Tax Court over the past two years. But none of the companies subtracted the bulk of those costs from their publicly reported results.<br />Instead, they analyzed the law and declared they are confident those losses will eventually be overturned. Coca-Cola, in particular, is gearing up for a contentious constitutional fight against the government, with $12 billion on the line.<br />Others—including  Newell Brands Inc.  and  Maxim Integrated Products Inc. —stand to lose millions under Treasury Department regulations issued in 2019, but say they remain confident the rules will eventually be thrown out and aren’t recording the costs.<br />“For them to say the tax authority has got it all wrong, that’s a pretty bold statement,” said Jack Ciesielski, an accounting expert and owner of R.G. Associates Inc., an investment research firm. The more conservative approach is to recognize the cost, note the legal dispute and reverse the cost later if the company prevails, he said."
