    "body": "You have to feel a little sorry for investors in gold. Central bankers and finance ministries have opened the cash sluices, and what looks like a speculative boom is under way in many corners of global financial markets. But over the past 12 months, the yellow metal—the original darling of skeptics of spendthrift governments—has underperformed the S&P 500.<br />At a bit below $1,800 a troy ounce, gold prices are far below the highs of around $2,050 reached in early August.<br />Watching bitcoin hit $50,000, SoftBank’s stock price surpass its dot-com boom high and even silver catch a bid from retail traders must be particularly difficult for holders of gold. Many had expected that the original speculative asset would prosper under the unusual market conditions of the past year.<br />Bank of America  commodity analysts announced an 18-month gold price target of $3,000 in April, before paring it back later in 2020. That forecast was made on the reasonable-seeming assumption that the bulging balance sheets of major central banks and huge fiscal rescue packages would be a boost to the asset most traditionally favored by investors worried about government profligacy.<br />But it simply hasn’t worked out that way. The metal’s recent performance should be confirmation, if any were really needed, that buyers of gold are really just buying inflation-protected government bonds under a different name. Since 2005, the yield on 10-year TIPS—inflation indexed U.S. government bonds—has had an R-squared relationship of 0.81 with the daily price of gold, meaning the moves in one explain the majority of moves in the other."
