    "body": "Six out of 10 New Yorkers say they believe Gov. Andrew Cuomo did something wrong in his handling of Covid-19 in the state’s nursing homes, according to a poll released Tuesday.<br />The poll by Marist College Institute for Public Opinion found the Democratic governor’s job-approval rating had slipped below 50%. Of the 953 adults surveyed Feb. 15 to 17, 49% said they approved and 44% said they disapproved of the job he is doing. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.<br />“Cuomo’s approval rating, which was sky high in the summer, has returned to its pre-pandemic level,” Marist Poll Director Lee M. Miringoff said. “Should Cuomo decide to seek a fourth term, these results suggest it will be a challenge. That said, his current numbers are comparable to what they were when he faced the voters last time.”<br />It is the third poll released amid weeks of rising criticism of the way Mr. Cuomo’s administration delayed a fuller accounting of the number of New Yorkers who died at long-term-care facilities. Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Mr. Cuomo, said the results varied between polls, and two other surveys showed the governor’s job approval above 50%.<br />“We remain focused on fighting this pandemic, administering as many vaccines as possible, and safely and smartly reopening our state,” Mr. Azzopardi said."
