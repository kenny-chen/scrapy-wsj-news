    "body": "Square  needs bitcoin to be the gateway to digital banking.<br />Chief Executive Jack Dorsey on Tuesday said bitcoin will be the “native currency” of the internet, and Square said it bought an additional $170 million worth of the digital currency in the fourth quarter—certainly more grist for those who believe bitcoin’s price tumble this week is just a hiccup. Bitcoin now makes up about 5% of the company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.<br />This may perhaps import a bit of bitcoin’s volatility into the company’s share price, which dipped 6% on Wednesday morning. Though any discount to its multiple would hardly make a dent: Square is trading at over 190 times forward earnings.<br />Still, it emphasizes the point that Square may need some pandemic-era trends, including the enthusiasm for bitcoin, to last into the future to reach the goals investors are betting on.<br />Take the original business of Square, providing payments and other services to small and medium-size sellers. Many of those merchants have adapted to incredibly tough conditions by adding websites, new revenue streams and virtual payments, and Square has upped spending on sales and marketing to help drive that transition. Square’s seller gross payment volume from online jumped 50% in 2020, even as its seller payment volume overall was flat for the year."
