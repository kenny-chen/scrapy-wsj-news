    "body": "In the crowded field to replace Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., two camps are emerging among the eight Democratic candidates: insiders and outsiders.<br />Five contenders entered the race with prosecutorial experience. Tali Farhadian Weinstein and Alvin Bragg worked as federal prosecutors in the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, respectively. Lucy Lang, Diana Florence and Liz Crotty are alumni of the Manhattan district attorney’s office.<br />Running on the most reformist platforms are the three remaining candidates, all of whom have never worked as a prosecutor: Tahanie Aboushi, a civil rights attorney, Assemblyman Dan Quart, who is also a civil litigator, and Eliza Orlins, a Manhattan public defender.<br />All of them are campaigning on an overhaul of the justice system with promises that were once on the political fringes but are now hallmarks of the progressive prosecutor movement.<br />The Democratic primary, on June 22, is seen as the decisive election for the four-year job, as no Republican with strong appeal has emerged. Mr. Vance seems increasingly unlikely to run for a fourth term. A campaign spokesperson said she expects him to make an announcement about his intentions in the next few weeks."
