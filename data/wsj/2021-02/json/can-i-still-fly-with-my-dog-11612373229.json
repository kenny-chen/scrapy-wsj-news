    "body": "BLAME ILL-BEHAVED pooches (or their owners) and an absurd parade of “emotional support” chickens and “comfort” tarantulas. As of January 2021, the Department of Transportation (DOT) began cracking down, limiting the types of furry companions allowed to fly in airline cabins free of charge. There is now only one acceptable candidate: a service animal. A service animal is not a pet; it’s a dog, highly and specifically trained to aid an “individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability,” according to the DOT. Official documentation is required in advance of travel. Other pets can still fly in the cabin on most U.S. airlines—including Alaska Airlines and  JetBlue —but for a fee (in the $125 range, each way) and only if they fit in a carrier under the seat. Rules vary but that generally disqualifies all animals but those about 25 pounds or under. If Spot is a healthy, 70-pound Dalmatian, cargo is an option, and some airlines like Delta have stepped up, with climate-controlled hold areas for live animals, specially trained personnel and strict weather guidelines. But before you book (well in advance) and load him into a hard-sided crate, check with your vet."
