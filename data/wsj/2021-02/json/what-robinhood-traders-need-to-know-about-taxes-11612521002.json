    "body": "Joseph Holler started day-trading stocks last July when he was stuck at home during the pandemic and his work slowed down.<br />“It was fun and exciting. I enjoyed it,” says Mr. Holler, a 38-year-old telecom salesman who lives near Huntsville, Ala., with his wife and their five children. Using several no-commission online brokers, he sometimes made more than 200 trades a day and thousands in 2020, according to brokerage records he provided. Overall, he says, he’s ahead by more than $8,000.<br />Now this fun will be put to the test by Uncle Sam: This week Mr. Holler received his first tax document, a 1099 form detailing a small portion of his trades. It’s 34 pages long.<br />“It’s so convoluted, I have no idea what it means,” says Mr. Holler, who has always prepared his own taxes using software. With hundreds more pages of records coming, he thinks he’ll need to hire a professional preparer this year.<br />Mr. Holler will have plenty of company soon. The brokerage industry added over 10 million new retail accounts in 2020, a record year, according to analyst Devin Ryan of JMP Securities."
