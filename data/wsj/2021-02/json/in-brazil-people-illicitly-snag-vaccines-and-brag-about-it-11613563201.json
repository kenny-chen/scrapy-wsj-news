    "body": "SÃO PAULO—Soon after a Covid-19 vaccine became available in a farming town in Brazil’s central savanna, health secretary Assis Silva Filho ordered nurses to vaccinate his wife ahead of local hospital workers.<br />“She’s the love of my life!” said Mr. Silva Filho, who also moonlights as an evangelical pastor in Pires do Rio, a town of 32,000 people. He added, “I would die for her,” in a video he posted to  Facebook  last month.<br />After being reported by people who witnessed the vaccination, he was targeted by prosecutors for criminal charges for demanding advantage as a public official, resigned and agreed to pay a $9,000 fine.<br />Brazil is only a month into its vaccination campaign against Covid-19, yet the country’s authorities have already been overwhelmed by several thousands of reports of people who circumvented the rules to get immunized before the most vulnerable.<br />Among those under investigation are politicians, influential business owners and lawyers, along with a host of other professionals, from veterinarians to fashion bloggers, most of whom incriminated themselves after posting vaccination selfies to social media, prosecutors said. Line jumpers have largely fallen into two groups, prosecutors say, the politically-connected or wealthy and those with friends in the medical community."
