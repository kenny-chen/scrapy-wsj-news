    "body": "Top financial regulators meeting Thursday to discuss recent market volatility related to  GameStop Corp .  concluded that “the core infrastructure was resilient,” the Treasury Department said in a statement following the meeting.<br />The regulators believed the infrastructure stood up “during high volatility and heavy trading volume” and agreed “on the importance of the SEC releasing a timely study of the events,” the Treasury Department said, in a reference to the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br />Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen “believes it is imperative to uphold the integrity of these markets and ensure investor protection,” the statement said.<br />Ms. Yellen convened the meeting with officials from the SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve Bank of New York to discuss the frenzied trading in recent weeks. The Treasury Department said they discussed market functionality and recent trading practices in equity, commodity and related markets.<br />The Reddit-fueled frenzy in stocks such as  GameStop ,  a videogame retailer, and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  has drawn scrutiny from regulators and prompted complaints that the trading, which sent some stock prices soaring, was manipulative."
