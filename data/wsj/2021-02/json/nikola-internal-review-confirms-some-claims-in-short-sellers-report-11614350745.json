    "body": "Nikola Corp.  said that a video of its electric truck in motion gave a misleading impression it was drivable and that its founder, Trevor Milton, had made several inaccurate statements, part of findings from the startup’s internal review of a damaging short seller’s report.<br />Short seller Hindenburg Research called Nikola an “intricate fraud” in a roughly 15,000-word September report, saying the company and Mr. Milton had misrepresented its technology. When Hindenburg’s report was released—sending the company’s stock sliding—Nikola said it was false and misleading and reiterated that in subsequent statements.<br />Nikola said Thursday that its review of Hindenburg’s allegations found that nine statements by the company or Mr. Milton were wholly or partially inaccurate. Among the things cited by Nikola was the video of the truck moving.<br />Nikola didn’t directly address other allegations in the short seller’s report other than to say: “In other respects, the Hindenburg article’s statements about the company were inaccurate.”<br />The review disputed Hindenburg’s conclusion that the company was a fraud, Nikola said, and outside consultants determined its staffing and technology were appropriate for an early-stage company. The review was commissioned by the company’s board and carried out by outside law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP."
