    "body": "After Trump, the deluge. Ask Andrew Cuomo.<br />During the pandemic, the New York governor’s daily coronavirus briefings made him the country’s most famous anti-Trump, a liberal folk hero, even as the media torched the virus policies of governors presumed to be acolytes of Mr. Trump—Florida’s Ron DeSantis, Texas’ Greg Abbott and, hilariously in retrospect, Georgia’s Brian Kemp.<br />Today, with Mr. Trump gone, the cheering has stopped for Mr. Cuomo. Progressives are always looking for someone to push out of their political path, and it looks now as if they’ve thrown their ropes around the Cuomo monument.<br />The state’s attorney general, Letitia James, a woman of New York’s Democratic left, has driven the governor to the edge of the cliff with a report that his office may have undercounted the state’s nursing-home deaths from Covid by up to 50%.<br />Headlines are screaming tweets from the state’s Democratic politicians: “Trash. No one believes you.”"
