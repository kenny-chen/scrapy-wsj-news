    "body": "Iran has produced material that is banned under the 2015 nuclear accords and could be used to form the core of a nuclear weapon, as it seeks to escalate pressure on the Biden administration to lift sanctions.<br />A confidential report by the United Nations atomic agency, seen by The Wall Street Journal, said Iran had started producing uranium metal on Feb. 6 at a nuclear facility in Isfahan that is under the agency’s inspection.<br />The material produced was a small amount of natural uranium metal, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported, meaning it wasn’t enriched. To use uranium metal, Iran would need around half a kilogram, or slightly more than one pound, of highly enriched uranium metal.<br />The Iranian government in December warned that it could start producing uranium metal within five months, following a law passed in Iran’s Parliament on Dec. 1, a threat that alarmed Western diplomats.<br />Iran has taken a series of recent steps in breach of the nuclear accord. It has increased its production of nuclear fuel, carried out enrichment in new sites and earlier this year produced 20% enriched uranium, the highest purity of the material it has made since 2013."
