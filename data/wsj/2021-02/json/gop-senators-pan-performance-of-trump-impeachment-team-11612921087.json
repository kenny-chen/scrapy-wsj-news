    "body": "WASHINGTON—Republican senators criticized former President Donald Trump’s impeachment lawyers’ presentations as underwhelming and ineffective, even as all but six GOP lawmakers sided with the defense team’s position that the case was unconstitutional.<br />In an afternoon session dedicated to the question of whether the trial was constitutional, Trump lawyer Bruce L. Castor Jr. had a rough start: He introduced himself as the “lead prosecutor,” before clarifying that he was Mr. Trump’s lead counsel and assuring senators: “I do understand the difference.”<br />In about 45 minutes of remarks, Mr. Castor veered from the fall of Rome and Greece to the trade-off between liberty and security, occasionally referencing his relationships with some senators while only briefly addressing the core questions of the case.<br />In an unusual concession, he said Democrats’ leadoff arguments had been better than expected. “I’ll be quite frank with you: We changed what we were going to do on account that we thought the House managers’ presentation was well done,” Mr. Castor said.<br />Republicans offered harsh assessments of Mr. Trump’s team, while many praised the Democrats’ lead manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, as well-prepared and impassioned."
