    "body": "Two high-profile New York Times staffers are leaving the company amid allegations of improper conduct in the workplace, the latest in a string of internal crises at the news outlet.<br />Audio producer Andy Mills, who played a key role in the launch of “The Daily” news podcast and was involved in the troubled podcast “Caliphate,” and Donald G. McNeil Jr., a star science and health reporter whose work on the coronavirus pandemic has been widely acclaimed, are leaving the Times, senior executives told staff on Friday.<br />The Times has faced criticism—both in its newsroom and on Twitter—that it isn’t applying its standards equally to all of its employees.<br />In a statement announcing his resignation, Mr. Mills said recent events, including the resurfacing of allegations regarding his behavior before his joining the Times in 2016, made the work atmosphere more difficult.<br />“The allegations on Twitter quickly escalated to the point where my actual shortcomings and past mistakes were replaced with gross exaggerations and baseless claims,” Mr. Mills wrote, noting that the online campaign had “grown to encompass some staffers of The Times.”"
