    "body": "WASHINGTON—Michael Regan, President Biden’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, drew bipartisan support at his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, including from North Carolina Republicans who said he has a history of working constructively with businesses.<br />If confirmed to the position, Mr. Regan, 44 years old, would be expected to implement Mr. Biden’s campaign promise to push power plants, oil and gas producers, and auto makers to address climate change by drastically reducing their greenhouse-gas emissions.<br />That could mean conflicts with business interests, but North Carolina’s two Republican senators—Sen. Richard Burr and Sen. Thom Tillis—said Mr. Regan worked effectively with business in his years heading North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality.<br />“I’ve spent a lot of time talking to people in North Carolina, people in the agriculture sector, people in the energy sector—and what they all said is Michael distinguished himself as somebody who listens,” Mr. Tillis said. “I do believe he will be somebody that we can rely on to be fair.”<br />The EPA is often at the center of rifts between Republicans and Democrats, but the comments from the Republican senators and a generally friendly confirmation hearing suggested he is on a path to Senate approval. The committee didn’t take a vote Wednesday."
