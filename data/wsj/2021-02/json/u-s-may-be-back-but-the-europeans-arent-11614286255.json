    "body": "Regarding William A. Galston’s “‘America Is Back,’ but Europe Has Moved” (Politics & Ideas, Feb. 24) about Europeans’ negative opinions about the U.S.: Can you blame them, since they draw their perceptions from locally distilled and commentated feeds of our media’s reports portraying us as a dystopian society full of idiots and criminals (not all of them politicians)? Who would want to follow the lead of an evil, warmongering and energy-squandering/CO2-spewing nation founded and run by white, male racists that hasn’t fully rejected the antiquated notions of capitalism, individual rights, personal responsibility, sacrifice for long-term gain and free enterprise?<br />Larry Kaufmann<br />Annapolis, Md.<br /><br />It isn’t surprising that Germany and others are enjoying a thumb in America’s eye, with President Trump being a good excuse to do so. But who are they going to call when Vladimir Putin restricts the flow through Nord Stream 2? The ghostbusters are probably too woke by now to intercede in fossil-fuel use. That leaves the U.S.—if Democratic Party policies still allow us to be a net energy producer when that 3 a.m. call comes."
