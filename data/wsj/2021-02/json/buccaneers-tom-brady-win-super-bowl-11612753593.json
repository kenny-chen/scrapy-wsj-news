    "body": "TAMPA, Fla.—This Super Bowl began nearly 11 months ago with one of the most phenomenal gambles in football history.<br />Just as Americans were beginning to grapple with a novel coronavirus that would change their lives more dramatically than almost anyone could imagine, Tom Brady launched a risky and improbable second act with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after two decades of unparalleled success with the New England Patriots. Tampa Bay, meanwhile, gambled its fortunes on a 43-year-old quarterback in the hopes he still had the ability to beat the likes of Patrick Mahomes.<br />On Sunday night, Tom Brady did it—again. Brady and the Buccaneers are Super Bowl champions.<br />The Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, giving Brady his record seventh Super Bowl title in a battle of generational greats that saw Brady once again reaching the pinnacle of his sport and Mahomes laboring to stay upright.<br />While Mahomes, the reigning Super Bowl MVP and champion, struggled behind a decimated offensive line and his defense committed a series of costly penalties, Brady played his greatest hits. He threw touchdown passes to tight end Rob Gronkowski. He picked apart the Kansas City defense. He won it all once again when so many doubted he could."
