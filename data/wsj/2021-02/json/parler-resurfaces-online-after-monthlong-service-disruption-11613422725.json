    "body": "Parler, the social network popular with conservatives, has come back online after going dark when some tech companies withdrew their services in the wake of the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol.<br />Amazon.com Inc.  removed Parler from its cloud-computing service a little over a month ago, effectively knocking the network offline.  Apple Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google removed it from their respective app stores. The tech companies said Parler had violated terms-of-service agreements, citing some of the content posted on the app.<br />On Monday, Parler said it was relaunching its service, which it said had grown to over 20 million users. “We’re thrilled to welcome everyone back,” Mark Meckler, Parler’s interim chief executive, said in a statement. “Parler is being run by an experienced team and is here to stay,” he said.<br />The social-media company said its new platform was “built on robust, sustainable, independent technology.” It said it was focused on restoring service to existing users during the first week and that new sign-ups would come after.<br />Parler’s Internet servers are now hosted by SkySilk Inc., which operates out of a Los Angeles-area data center, according to Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis with the network-monitoring firm Kentik Inc."
