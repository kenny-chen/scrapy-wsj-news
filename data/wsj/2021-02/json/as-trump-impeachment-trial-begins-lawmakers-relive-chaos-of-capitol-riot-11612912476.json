    "body": "WASHINGTON—The second impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump opened with graphic videos of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Some of the clips played by the House impeachment managers featured the senators themselves and the same chamber in which they now sit in judgment.<br />Almost all 100 senators, most of them masked because of Covid-19, silently watched and listened in the hushed chamber as rioters on the screens rammed doors, attacked police, and chanted: “Treason!” and “Traitors!” and “Where the f--- are they?!”<br />The trial began 27 days after the House impeached Mr. Trump, accusing him of inciting the mob that stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn his loss to President Biden in the November election.<br />As the video played Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) watched from his front-row seat near the middle of the floor. He sat motionless, his hands clasped loosely in his lap, as the video replayed his own forceful speech from that same spot, shortly before rioters broke into the building.<br />In those remarks, Mr. McConnell said there was no doubt that Mr. Biden won the presidency on Nov. 3. He warned that overturning the election would send democracy into a “death spiral.”"
