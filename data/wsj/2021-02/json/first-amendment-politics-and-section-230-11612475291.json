    "body": "In “The Constitution Can Crack Section 230” (op-ed, Jan. 30), Philip Hamburger forgets how the First Amendment and Section 230 exist to create vibrant marketplaces for all kinds of expression. And both have done exactly that online and offline. Without Section 230 and its common-sense liability protections, the internet would likely become a one-size-fits-all cesspool. It would leave Americans with either an anything-goes, Wild West of an internet or an internet where aggressively moderated websites permit virtually nothing.<br />Section 230 prevents these dystopian outcomes. The law empowers platforms to compete for users by creating a variety of forums—from kid-safe and family-friendly to the more provocative and disturbing. It gives small businesses the chance to meaningfully compete against larger companies by saving them from the threat of devastating legal fees. That means Section 230 fosters a competitive internet where all users can engage in forums that best meet their unique needs.<br />Trace Mitchell<br />NetChoice<br />Washington"
