    "body": "A federal judge issued a second ruling that blocked the Biden administration’s planned 100-day pause on most deportations, saying the approach was legally flawed.<br />U.S. District Judge Drew B. Tipton of the Southern District of Texas, in a decision issued late Tuesday night, said the administration hadn’t offered a reasonable explanation for an across-the-board pause that left little room for considering deportations on a case-by-case basis.<br />The Biden administration on Jan. 20, its first day, announced the 100-day deportation moratorium, and the Department of Homeland Security began enforcing the pause on Jan. 22.<br />Judge Tipton said the new administration was entitled to leeway to formulate its enforcement priorities and review the Trump administration’s immigration policies, “but a need to assess priorities does not necessarily mean a pause on government functions.”<br />The judge, a Trump appointee, issued a temporary restraining order last month that initially blocked the policy, but those orders are short in duration. In the latest move, he issued a preliminary injunction against the pause, which will block it indefinitely."
