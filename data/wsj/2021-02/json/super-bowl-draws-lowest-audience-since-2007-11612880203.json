    "body": "The Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ lopsided win over the Kansas City Chiefs combined with a pandemic that prevented many from attending big viewing parties in homes and bars led to the smallest audience for a Super Bowl since 2007.<br />About 96.4 million people watched ageless wonder Tom Brady lead the Buccaneers to a 31-9 Super Bowl victory over the defending champion Chiefs on  CBS ,  a 5.5% decrease from the 102 million that saw last year’s much closer and coronavirus-free match between the Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers on Fox.<br />The total audience for both games includes both traditional television and streaming platforms.<br />The last time the Super Bowl had such a small number of viewers was the 2007 contest between the Indianapolis Colts and Chicago Bears, which averaged 93.2 million viewers.<br />The audience on CBS was just over 91.6 million, down from the 99.9 million viewers that watched last year’s game on Fox, according to Nielsen."
