    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden said the Myanmar military’s seizure of power was a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and that the U.S. would hold the leaders of Monday’s coup accountable.<br />The U.S. has limited leverage against the military leadership in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Broad economic sanctions such as those used by the George W. Bush and Obama administrations could alienate the country’s population and hurt public attitude toward the West, analysts say.<br />U.S. trade with Myanmar is small. Meanwhile, Beijing enjoys a multibillion-dollar trade and investment relationship with its neighbor and has expressed less public concern than the U.S. about who is in charge. That raises the possibility that any U.S. action could further drive Myanmar toward China, exacerbating tensions between Washington and Beijing as they compete for influence in the region.<br />U.S. options include broadening human-rights sanctions against leaders of the coup that are already in place over the country’s treatment of its Rohingya Muslim minority, and tracking and disclosing the military leaders’ international business dealings.<br />The United Nations Security Council is set to meet on Tuesday to discuss Myanmar in a closed session."
