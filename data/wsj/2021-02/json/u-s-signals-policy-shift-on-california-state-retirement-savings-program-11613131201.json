    "body": "Signaling a shift in retirement policy, the U.S. Labor Department has dropped its support for a lawsuit that seeks to invalidate a California state retirement-savings program for people who lack access to 401(k) plans at work.<br />In a notice filed in a federal appeals court on Feb. 5, the agency said because of the change in administration, it “no longer wishes to participate” in the case and “does not support either side.”<br />The reversal “isn’t surprising,” said John Scott, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts’s retirement-savings project. President Biden, during his campaign, expressed support for government-sponsored savings programs for the estimated one-third of private-sector workers who lack access to a workplace retirement-savings plan.<br />Currently, three states—California, Oregon and Illinois—are enrolling workers in such plans. Other states, including New Jersey, Maryland, Colorado and Connecticut, are developing similar programs.<br />Mr. Scott said the Biden administration might ultimately decide to back a nationwide retirement-savings program for those without such plans at work. “It just depends on their priorities,” he said."
