    "body": "Mudrick Capital Management LP, the hedge fund that provided a much-needed lifeline to  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  in December, is sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in gains following last week’s rally in the price of AMC’s shares.<br />The New York-based firm made $200 million in profit, mostly from its holdings in AMC debt, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />Mudrick’s gains derive from a combination of paper gains and realized trades, the person said.<br />Last week, AMC shares nearly tripled in value as the cinema chain’s stock caught the attention of individual investors swarming popular Reddit forums who were looking to repeat the dizzying rally seen in shares of  GameStop Corp.<br />Most of Mudrick Capital’s gains, however, are from its holdings in the company’s bonds, which rallied as the company’s share price increased."
