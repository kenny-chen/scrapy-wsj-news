    "body": "Walter Isaacson asks some very important questions in “What Gene Editing Can Do for Humankind” (Review, Feb. 20), and I am glad he does. However, I am curious as to what in his lifetime of human study leads him to believe that we will handle this weighty situation with grace, humility and love, especially when it comes to whether we will responsibly and ethically edit humans before they are born. Only one ethical conclusion will protect us from ourselves: CRISPR technology should be limited exclusively to healing genetic diseases in breathing humans.<br />Megan Davidson<br />Colorado Springs, Colo.<br /><br />As we venture into a brave new world of astonishing medical knowledge, the same old question comes up: Are humans capable of using knowledge for a better world? The answer is yes. Consider when the atom was split. It was followed by the end of the Second World War and a new source of clean energy, not more destructive wars as predicted. That’s mainly because we have learned ways to make those infamous slippery slopes less slippery."
