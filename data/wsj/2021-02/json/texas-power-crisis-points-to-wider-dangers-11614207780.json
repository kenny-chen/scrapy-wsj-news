    "body": "The Texas power crisis demonstrated the fragility of the nation’s electricity infrastructure. Outmoded policies and regulations have disabled the creation of a market for resiliency.<br />In most states, utilities are regulated monopolies. A Public Utility Commission sets rates based on state laws, many of which allow utilities to charge a premium for renewable electricity. That has induced utilities to install gigawatts of wind and solar capacity.<br />But there are no such incentives for resiliency. Not only aren’t utilities required to provide more-reliable power; they can’t offer resiliency at a higher price because rates are fixed. It is as if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn’t require air bags or seat belts and forbade automakers to charge a premium if these safety features were provided.<br />Worse, many states penalize customers who try to implement their own resiliency solutions. In California, essential businesses are forced to pay punitive charges to the utilities if they generate nonintermittent onsite power. PUCs and utilities suggest that these charges ensure that customers pay their “fair share” to fund wildfire mitigation and energy-efficiency programs.<br />To build a resilient power marketplace, lawmakers and PUCs should create incentives for resiliency, as they encouraged renewable energy. They should authorize higher rates for resilient electricity, so that utilities can make long-delayed infrastructure upgrades."
