    "body": "The eurozone economy faces a rising risk of sliding into its second recession since the pandemic first struck as high Covid-19 infection rates and government restrictions left its services sector mired in a fifth straight month of contraction during January.<br />The economy shrank in the final three months of last year, and another quarter of declining output would leave it further behind the U.S. and China in charting a recovery from the pandemic’s toll.<br />Surveys of purchasing managers compiled by data firm  IHS Markit  released Wednesday showed a steeper decline in services activity than in the final month of last year.<br />In China, a similar survey of service providers recorded a continued expansion in January but at the weakest rate in nine months, as a fresh outbreak in the north of the country was met with restrictions on the movements of millions of people.<br />Japan’s services sector contracted more sharply in January as rising infection rates prompted the declaration of a state of emergency in the capital city and neighboring prefectures."
