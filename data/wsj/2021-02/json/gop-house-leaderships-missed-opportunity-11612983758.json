    "body": "Kimberley A. Strassel’s “The GOP’s First 2021 Victory” (Potomac Watch, Feb. 5) is totally off base. What she calls a victory, a majority of the American public see as a huge loss. The Republican leadership, in particular Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, showed a lack of leadership and no guts in not removing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee positions.<br />The “victory” would have been the Republican Party showing true leadership by condemning the earlier comments of Rep. Greene and making her pay a price for them. Not doing so and leaving the decision to the House to strip her of her committee roles exposes the Republican Party’s toleration of QAnon, the Proud Boys and those who believe the earth is flat. The Republicans should have done better.<br />Lou Vigliotti<br />Naples, Fla.<br />"
