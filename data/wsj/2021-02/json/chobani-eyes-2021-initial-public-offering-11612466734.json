    "body": "Chobani LLC, the food company that made Greek yogurt mainstream, is laying the groundwork for a public listing of its shares.<br />Chobani is eyeing an initial public offering later this year that it hopes could value the Norwich, N.Y., company at as much as $7 billion to $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The 16-year-old company has been expanding into faster-growing segments such as refrigerated coffees, creamer and oat milk, and an infusion of cash from an IPO could give that effort a boost. It recently hired new executives including Chief Financial Officer Jody Macedonio and Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Cristina Alesci.<br />“As we create the food company of the future, we’ll look at all options carefully to fuel our ambitious plans, especially with oatmilk and plant-based products,” Chobani founder Hamdi Ulukaya said in a statement. “An IPO is definitely one exciting direction but whether or not we’re public, we’ll keep disrupting and making things better.”<br />The IPO market has been on a tear, with high-profile debuts of companies including  Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.  late last year, and it has rarely if ever been more hospitable to new entrants. There has also been an avalanche of new special-purpose acquisition companies, with dozens of the so-called blank-check vehicles looking for targets to merge with. Chobani could be a candidate for one, though some of the people cautioned that the odds of that outcome are remote."
