    "body": "Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.  said costs related to the coronavirus pandemic have dented profit even as online orders boost sales.<br />The burrito chain said Tuesday that earnings in its latest quarter were hurt as the pandemic worsened. Chipotle said it paid more in medical claims and performance-related bonuses to employees keeping its restaurants open during the health crisis.<br />The company, based in Newport Beach, Calif., reported earnings adjusted for one-time items of $3.48 a share for the fourth quarter, compared with $2.86 a share a year earlier. The latest results were short of the $3.73 a share that analysts expected. Sales of $1.6 billion hit expectations.<br />Shares in the chain fell nearly 2% to $1,495 in after-hours trading. “The pandemic has presented new challenges for all of us,” Chipotle Chief Executive Brian Niccol said to investors.<br />Labor has become a growing concern for companies as diverse as manufacturers and food producers during the pandemic. Some restaurant chains have said they expect labor costs to rise this year as they pay to hire and retain workers in public-facing roles. The Biden administration is also looking to boost the minimum wage, which would translate into higher wages for many restaurant chains."
