    "body": "Trevor Bauer, by almost any objective measure, is not the best player in baseball. For the next two seasons, however, Bauer will likely be the highest-paid player in baseball.<br />The reason why says a lot about Bauer’s unorthodox priorities and the lengths teams will go to find new ways to game the complex universe of player salaries.<br />Bauer, a 30-year-old pitcher who won National League Cy Young honors in 2020, finalized one of the most unusual and fascinating contracts in American professional sports this week: a three-year pact with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $102 million.<br />Except it’s more complicated than that. The agreement is essentially three separate one-year deals, giving Bauer the option to return to the free-agent market after each season. It calls for him averaging $42.5 million in compensation in 2021 and 2022, far surpassing any of his peers.<br />It’s after that when things get really interesting. Bauer’s contract is structured so that it’s unlikely he exercises his option for the third season, making it a three-year deal that really isn’t for three years."
