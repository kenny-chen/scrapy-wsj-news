    "body": "The Texas energy crisis is over, but the settling of the massive bills left behind has just begun.<br />Residents, businesses and cities face soaring bills from the deep freeze that last week gripped the second most-populous U.S. state after California, sending electricity and natural gas prices skyrocketing and triggering blackouts that lasted in places for four days.<br />Wholesale power prices on Texas’ main power grid hit the ceiling price of $9,000 per megawatt hour for parts of five straight days. That was exponentially higher than the average price, which was $21.18 per megawatt hour in 2020, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, the nonprofit that controls the grid.<br />Now power retailers and municipal utilities are trying to figure out how to pass on the billions of dollars in costs to customers, some of whom face bills in the thousands of dollars that may need to be stretched out over time.<br />In Denton, a North Texas university city that suffered outages and natural-gas supply shortages, city leaders are looking to borrow up to $300 million to cover fuel expenses from last week, which amounts to around $2,000 for each of the city’s 150,000 residents."
