    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s allies are preparing to create a new nonprofit advocacy organization, with the White House’s approval, that will be funded by donors and seek to build support for his policy agenda, senior administration officials said.<br />The nonprofit, whose working name is “Building Back Together,” is expected to run advertisements promoting the president’s policies and coordinate with existing nonprofit advocacy organizations on issues such as Covid-19, climate change and the economy.<br />White House officials won’t directly oversee the nonprofit, but senior Biden officials have been involved in discussions about its structure and have chosen a group of Biden campaign veterans and allies to establish it. The officials said Mr. Biden and senior White House advisers have been briefed on the planning.<br />Anita Dunn, a White House senior adviser and top campaign aide, said the nonprofit will work with existing advocacy organizations to try to build coalitions of support.<br />“This is not to replicate. It is not to duplicate,” Ms. Dunn said, but will work with those existing groups."
