    "body": "The day Robinhood Markets Inc. brokerage restricted trading in  GameStop Corp. , a howl rose among the small-time traders looking to take a swing at Wall Street big shots during the market’s end-of-January frenzy.<br />The trading folderol caught the attention of Robin Hood enthusiasts in Nottingham, England, where legends swirl of past campaigns to squeeze the rich.<br />Bob White, at home that day, Jan. 28, was the first to see opportunity. His phone started beeping and wouldn’t let up. As chairman of the World Wide Robin Hood Society—a band of some 10 people—Mr. White handles the group’s Twitter account, @robinhood. Most days, he said, he gets one or two pings.<br />Furious traders messaged him as the feud between Reddit users and Wall Street blew up, thinking his was the Twitter account of Robinhood, the brokerage, not Robin Hood, the legendary outlaw’s booster group.<br />“The thing was just going ping, ping, ping, ping,” the 77-year-old author and amateur historian said. “All these messages were just scrolling off the screen, about how they couldn’t trade these stocks.”"
