    "body": "Jake Schlein began investing when he was 14 years old with the help of a $10,000 gift and a custodial account opened by his father.<br />He started out playing it safe—sticking to well-established companies like Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.<br />Then the mania around  GameStop Corp.  erupted.<br />Jake bought 33 shares at $87 a piece last month after he and his friends saw the hype on  Twitter ,  Discord and Reddit’s notorious WallStreetBets forum. After a wild ride that sent the shares soaring as high as $483 on Jan. 28, GameStop closed Thursday at $53.50.<br />The now 16-year-old says he has no intention of selling the stock anytime soon—even though his father, a former  Citigroup Inc.  executive and longtime financial professional, has suggested he cash out."
