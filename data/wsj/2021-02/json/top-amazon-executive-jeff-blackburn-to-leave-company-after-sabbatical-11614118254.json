    "body": "Jeff Blackburn, a top  Amazon.com Inc.  executive and close aide to Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, is leaving the company after taking a yearlong sabbatical.<br />Mr. Blackburn announced his departure in a memo to the company Tuesday reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. He said he isn’t retiring and would soon share what he will be doing next.<br />“I hope that, on the margin, I pushed [the senior executive] team and Amazon to be even more bold, see around corners, think big,” Mr. Blackburn wrote. “What an amazing 22 years it has been together—I will cherish it, forever.”<br />Mr. Blackburn’s departure comes after a wave of leadership changes at the online commerce giant. Mr. Bezos said earlier this month he would step down as CEO to become executive chairman after heading the company for more than 26 years. Jeff Wilke, a longtime executive and CEO of Amazon’s consumer-facing businesses, is retiring from the company on Monday.<br />Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Wilke were once seen as potential successors to Mr. Bezos. Andy Jassy, who has long headed Amazon’s booming cloud-computing business, is succeeding Mr. Bezos. He is set to start as CEO in the third quarter."
