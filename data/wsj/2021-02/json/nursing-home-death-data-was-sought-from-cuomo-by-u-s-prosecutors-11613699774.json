    "body": "Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn sought data this month on nursing-home deaths from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration, people familiar with the matter said, after state officials took months to respond to a separate inquiry by the Justice Department.<br />The prosecutors’ request seeks the number of New York nursing-home deaths due to Covid-19 and when and where they occurred, as part of a broader inquiry into the state’s handling of the pandemic in those care settings, the people said.<br />One person said federal prosecutors requested the nursing-home death data after Mr. Cuomo’s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, told state lawmakers last week that the administration had held off on releasing the information because of an earlier Justice Department Civil Division probe. State officials worried the information would be politicized by the Trump administration, Ms. DeRosa said, according to a transcript of the conversation released by the administration.<br />Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Mr. Cuomo, said Thursday the Justice Department has been looking into the nursing-home issue for months. “We have been cooperating with them, and we will continue to do so,” Mr. Azzopardi said. “We will have no other comment on this matter.”<br />A spokesman for prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York declined to comment."
