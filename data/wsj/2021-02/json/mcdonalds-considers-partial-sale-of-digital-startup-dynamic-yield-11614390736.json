    "body": "McDonald’s Corp.  said it is considering selling part of digital startup Dynamic Yield Ltd., which it acquired less than two years ago in a bid to boost sales at drive-throughs and digital kiosks.<br />Dynamic Yield, which helps retailers provide personalized digital promotions to consumers using streams of customer data, has operated as a stand-alone company within the chain. For McDonald’s, it provides personalized offers for customers of its stores. It also works with other retailers to boost online sales.<br />Liad Agmon, founder and CEO of Dynamic Yield, said in a statement Friday that the potential partial sale “has been discussed from the outset and now feels like the right time to explore that possibility.”<br />McDonald’s in 2019 paid more than $300 million for Dynamic Yield, which was then its largest acquisition in decades. Executives have called it a central part of the burger chain’s evolving digital strategy.<br />McDonald’s said it was exploring a sale of the portion of the Israeli-based technology firm that works with other retailers, a growing part of its business."
