    "body": "Volvo said electric vehicles made up more than a third of the company’s new car sales in the European Union, which has roared past China as the world’s biggest plug-in market.<br />Volvo Cars, the Swedish auto maker owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, was one of the first well-known Western brands to shift its focus to making electric cars, at the expense of the internal combustion engine. Others have joined the fray, including Volkswagen AG  and, last week, General Motors Corp.<br />That tilt is now paying off on Volvo’s home turf, where the strategy coincided with an aggressive push by EU officials to promote EVs. After early skepticism, European car buyers are warming up.<br />Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo’s chief executive, said Thursday the company is on track to shift half of its sales to fully electric vehicles by 2025. Volvo launched its first battery electric car last year, the XC40 compact SUV, and plans to launch another fully electric car this year.<br />The company said it sold 115,436 plug-in electric cars world-wide last year, about 17% of its total sales of 661,713 vehicles. In Europe, plug-ins accounted for 36% of total sales in the second half and 31% for the full year, driven by sales of the XC40 battery electric model, and the XC60 and V60 plug-in vehicles."
