    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration Monday reversed a last-minute decision by former President Donald Trump to lift aluminum tariffs on the United Arab Emirates.<br />Mr. Trump on his final day in office, Jan. 20, issued a proclamation to exempt the U.A.E. from a 10% tariff on aluminum imports, citing “an important security relationship,” and said a quota would suffice. The tariffs were first imposed in 2018.<br />The exemption for the U.A.E. would have gone into effect Feb. 3, but Monday night, President Biden blocked it. “In my view, the available evidence indicates that imports from the U.A.E. may still displace domestic production, and thereby threaten to impair our national security,” he wrote in a proclamation.<br />“I believe that maintaining the tariff is likely to be more effective in protecting our national security than the untested quota,” Mr. Biden’s statement added.<br />The U.A.E. embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night."
