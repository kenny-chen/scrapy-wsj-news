    "body": "Investors’ near-insatiable demand for even the riskiest corporate debt is fueling a Wall Street lending boom, offering lifelines for struggling companies even as the coronavirus pandemic still drags on the economy.<br />Companies such as hospital operator  Community Health Systems Inc.  and newspaper publisher  Gannett Co. Inc.  have issued a record $139 billion of bonds and loans with below investment-grade ratings from the start of the year through Feb. 10, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. More than $13 billion of that debt had ratings triple-C or lower—the riskiest tier save for outright default—about twice the previous record pace.<br />Despite the onslaught of new bonds, riskier companies can now borrow at interest rates once reserved for the safest type of debt.<br />As of Friday, the average yield for bonds in the  ICE  BofA US High Yield Index—a group that includes embattled retailers and fracking companies—was just 3.97%. By comparison, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which carries essentially no default risk, was as high as 3.23% less than three years ago. The 10-year Treasury yielded around 1.2% Friday.<br />“At a high level, you have a meaningful imbalance between supply and demand,” said David Knutson, head of credit research for the Americas at  Schroders ,  the U.K. asset management firm. “The demand exceeds the supply for bonds.”"
