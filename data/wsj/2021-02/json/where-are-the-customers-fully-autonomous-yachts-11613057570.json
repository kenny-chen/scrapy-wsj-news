    "body": "In a go-go market, who needs Wall Street research reports? Just take a quick glance at the recommendation and price target and get busy trading. But a portfolio manager who merely skims Stifel analyst Scott Devitt’s Wednesday note with a “buy” recommendation on  Uber Technologies  and a $67 price target is missing out.<br />“In our opinion, there is a lot of nonsense in financial markets at the moment. It is hard to know whether one should take much of anything seriously until this period of euphoria ends. We are analysts so it’s better to have something to recommend, even if just on a relative basis.”<br />That is hardly a typical Wall Street seal of approval. Even the math behind his target is underwhelming. Mr. Devitt notes that Uber shares trade at 33 times projected 2024 earnings. “If nothing goes wrong in the world (or at Uber) over the next three years, an investor could eke out an okay equity return, assuming current valuations hold up. If we are wrong, it’s likely to be because everything is overvalued and there will be better entry points in the future.”<br />In case that left investors who bothered to read the summary feeling uninspired, even nervous, Mr. Devitt signed off with an inspirational message: “go get em folks.”"
