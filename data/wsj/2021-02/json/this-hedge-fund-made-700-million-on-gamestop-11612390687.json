    "body": "Richard Mashaal and Brian Gonick started buying  GameStop  Corp.  shares in September.<br />They aren’t Reddit day traders or Discord users. They are hedge-fund managers in New York. And when the stock surged from less than $10 a share to above $400 and the dust had settled, they were sitting on a profit of nearly $700 million, one of the great fortunes of the January market mania.<br />The GameStop surge is often cast as a triumph of amateurs over professionals. Which it was, to a degree. But it also was a trade that pitted professionals against other professionals—and few have made more money than Senvest Management LLC, Messrs. Mashaal’s and Gonick’s firm.<br />“When it started its march, we thought, something’s percolating here,” said Mr. Mashaal, 55 years old. “But we had no idea how crazy this thing was going to get.”<br />Senvest’s interest in the videogame retailer was piqued by a presentation from the new GameStop chief executive at a consumer investment conference in January 2020."
