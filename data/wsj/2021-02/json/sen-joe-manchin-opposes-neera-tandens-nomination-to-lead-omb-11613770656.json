    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said he would oppose Neera Tanden’s nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget, citing her past statements on social media, imperiling her chances of getting confirmed by the Senate.<br />Mr. Manchin, of West Virginia, said he made his decision after reviewing the comments critical of lawmakers she made on  Twitter  while she led the Center for American Progress, a center-left think tank. Mr. Manchin, a centrist who represents a state that voted twice for former President Donald Trump, is seen as a swing vote in the Senate.<br />“I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,” Mr. Manchin said in a Friday statement. “For this reason, I cannot support her nomination.”<br />The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Manchin’s statement.<br />The Senate has so far confirmed seven of Mr. Biden’s top nominees, all with bipartisan support. If the White House were to pull Ms. Tanden’s nomination or it failed to reach the 51 votes needed for confirmation, it would mark the first time one of Mr. Biden’s nominees has been blocked."
