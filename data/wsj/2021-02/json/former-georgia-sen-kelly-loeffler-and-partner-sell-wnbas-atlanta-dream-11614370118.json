    "body": "Former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler and a co-owner have sold the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream, concluding a saga that last year saw the Dream’s players campaigning for one of Loeffler’s election opponents.<br />The buyers are Larry Gottesdiener, founder and chairman of the real-estate firm Northland Investment Corporation; Northland president and COO Suzanne Abair; and former Atlanta Dream star Renee Montgomery.<br />Montgomery is the first former player to become both an owner and executive of a WNBA team. Her role as an executive will include marketing work and “connecting the Atlanta Dream to our community here in Atlanta,” Montgomery said in a Friday conference call.<br />Gottesdiener, who said he is the Dream’s majority owner, said the group aims to “create a culture with shared values that Atlanta will be proud of, that will support our players and that will amplify their message of women’s empowerment and social justice.”<br />Gottesdiener said he grew up in Connecticut and has followed the University of Connecticut’s dominant women’s basketball team, along with the WNBA since its 1997 launch. He added that he has a “gritty firstborn daughter who was so pissed off that the high school didn’t have a girls wrestling team that she went out and competed on the men’s team.”"
