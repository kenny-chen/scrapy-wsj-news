    "body": "It is tempting to want to get in on the  GameStop  rally.<br />The stock rose over 1,600% in January. People are claiming to have become overnight millionaires. For some, there is the bonus incentive that all the craziness seems to be part of a movement to stick it to Wall Street.<br />So a sense of FOMO, or fear of missing out, is understandable.<br />Still, there are plenty of reasons to fight the urge to jump in. And there is plenty to know if you just can’t resist.<br />First, be clear about what GameStop is and isn’t at this point. It isn’t an investment. It isn’t a trade. It is a gamble, pure and simple."
