    "body": "In less than four hours, 65 commercials costing an average of $5.6 million per 30-second spot aired in front of 91.5 million Super Bowl LV viewers, according to the market-research firm Kantar Group. The total spend during the 2021 game was an estimated $485 million.<br />So, how did the ads do?<br />“An uncomfortable aspect in marketing is that calculating the true return on investment is always elusive,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University who with his colleague Tim Calkins has run the Kellogg Super Bowl Ad Review for 17 years.<br />But, Dr. Rucker said, there’s evidence that Super Bowl ads do generate business.<br />After a commercial for the startup Death Wish Coffee aired during the National Football League’s title game in 2016, sales boomed, leading the company to move into a space that was nearly triple the size of its existing facility to keep up with demand."
