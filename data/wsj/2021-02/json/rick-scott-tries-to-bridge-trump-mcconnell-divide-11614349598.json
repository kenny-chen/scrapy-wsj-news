    "body": "WASHINGTON—When Rick Scott spoke by phone with former President Donald Trump last week, the Florida senator told Mr. Trump he needed his help to ensure Republicans win back the Senate majority in 2022.<br />Mr. Scott heads the Senate Republicans’ campaign committee, which is tasked in part with helping re-elect the party’s incumbents. But he didn’t ask Mr. Trump to refrain from endorsing primary opponents against GOP senators whom Mr. Trump has derided as disloyal for publicly criticizing him, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.<br />“No, I never talked to him about that,” Mr. Scott said in an interview. “If endorsements mattered, I wouldn’t have been a governor, and I wouldn’t have been a U.S. senator.”<br />The strategy is characteristic of how Mr. Scott plans to approach a series of competitive primaries that will be the next proving ground in the fight for the future of the GOP.<br />The wealthy businessman and former governor adamantly rejects the narrative that the Republican Party is embroiled in a civil war, even as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) accused Mr. Trump of a “disgraceful dereliction of duty,” and Mr. Trump slammed Mr. McConnell as a “political hack,” pledging to field his own primary rivals."
