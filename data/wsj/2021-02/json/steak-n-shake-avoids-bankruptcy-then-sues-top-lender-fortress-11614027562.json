    "body": "Steak ’n Shake Inc. sued lender Fortress Investment Group LLC after the burger chain paid off debt coming due to avoid bankruptcy, accusing Fortress of misusing confidential information to mount a takeover bid.<br />The Indiana-based milkshake-and-burger chain, backed by entrepreneur Sardar Biglari, said that Fortress obtained sensitive information through negotiations for a potential real estate deal with Steak ’n Shake, then used that knowledge to build an $89 million position in the company’s loans.<br />After acquiring the loans, Fortress made clear it “would not accept a negotiated repayment” and said it “would either force the company to repay the loans in full or file for bankruptcy,” according to the complaint.<br />Steak ’n Shake paid off the loans in full on Friday, spending nearly $103 million to retire the debts and avoid a bankruptcy filing, the company said.<br />Steak ’n Shake’s lawsuit, filed Friday in Marion County Superior Court in Indiana, seeks to recoup alleged losses from Fortress’s actions."
