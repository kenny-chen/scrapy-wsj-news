    "body": "Italian government bonds rallied as investors cheered the news that former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi had been asked to form a new government.<br />The gap between yields on 10-year Italian bonds and their German equivalents fell to the tightest level in nearly five years, at 1.027 percentage points, according to  Tradeweb .  Yields fall when bond prices rise. Italy’s stock market also rallied, with the FTSE MIB benchmark up 2.6%.<br />Italy’s coalition government collapsed in January over arguments about how to spend European Union funding meant to spur the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Draghi, who was credited as ECB chief with saving the eurozone from its political and financial crisis in 2012, is seen by investors as a safe, technocratic leader capable of helping Italy out of its worst recession since World War II.<br />The market reaction suggests investors think Mr. Draghi can govern for a while and enact reforms, said Sebastien Galy, a macro strategist at  Nordea Asset Management .  But there are no guarantees.<br />“Should he fail to form a government, a snap election would be called, and the odds are still moderate that this will happen given the fractious nature of Italian politics,” Mr. Galy said."
