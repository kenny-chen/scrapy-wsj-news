    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Hal Holbrook, who died on Jan. 23 at age 95—his death was announced this week—spent most of his long career working in television, first as a soap-opera lead, then in series, miniseries and made-for-TV movies that are almost entirely forgotten today (who now remembers “The Bold Ones: The Senator”?) save by wizened couch potatoes. He was rarely seen on Broadway, and on the big screen he generally appeared in choice but small character roles, most memorably in Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln,” in which he played a shrewd presidential adviser, and “All the President’s Men,” in which he was Deep Throat.<br />Yet Mr. Holbrook is remembered to this day for his two greatest stage roles, both of which he also had the uncommon good luck to perform in very fine TV versions that remain in circulation. (They can be viewed on YouTube.)"
