    "body": "So, Betsy LeRoy, owner of Pizza By Elizabeths, voted for Joe Biden full well knowing what he was going to do about the $15 minimum wage, but now she is complaining (“Biden Tests the Adage ‘The Customer Is Always Right,’” op-ed, Feb. 6). I assume she will also complain when her taxes go higher, when gasoline gets to $3.50 a gallon and when it will cost her more to heat her house and business among all the other things Joe Biden’s presidency will impose on her.<br />I have no sympathy for her. Ms. LeRoy got what she voted for. Sounds like the chickens are coming home to roost.<br />Tim Sogar<br />Villa Hills, Ky.<br />"
