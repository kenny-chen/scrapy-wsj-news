    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court late Friday exempted churches from California’s public-health order banning indoor gatherings in counties suffering widespread risk of Covid-19 infections, but permitted the state to forbid singing and chanting at worship services.<br />The court’s order, based on challenges by two churches, exposed stark divisions among the justices over the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Three liberal justices, as they have throughout the emergency, would have approved the most aggressive interventions to stem the spread of infections.<br />Three of the most conservative justices viewed the state’s regulations as infringing on religious rights and would have granted the churches all they wished, or nearly so.<br />Chief Justice John Roberts sought to walk a middle path, and, along with Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, voted to set aside the ban on indoor worship while leaving intact the singing restriction.<br />In November, the court by a 5-4 vote set aside New York state regulations limiting attendance at religious services."
