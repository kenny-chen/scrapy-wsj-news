    "body": "Waves of attempted fraud during the pandemic have plagued state unemployment benefits programs. We answer questions on what unemployment fraud is, how it is affecting the national jobless claims report and what states are doing to combat it.<br />There are different types of unemployment insurance fraud, including when someone knowingly continues to collect unemployment benefits after returning to work.<br />During the pandemic, states have grappled with a rise in unemployment insurance fraud tied to identity theft. In this form of fraud, criminals steal victims’ identities and then apply for unemployment benefits.<br />Victims of identity theft often discover they have been targeted when they try to file for jobless benefits, receive notification from the state unemployment office, receive an Internal Revenue Service form noting the payments or get a notification from their employer, a Federal Bureau of Investigation notice said.<br />Unemployment fraud doesn’t appear to be distorting the long-term trend in jobless claims. Filings climbed last spring when the pandemic first hit and fell over the summer during business reopenings. They stagnated over much of the winter and improved in recent weeks."
