    "body": "Bill Gates is doubling down on private-jet travel, as the niche industry recovers more quickly amid the coronavirus pandemic than the wider commercial aviation market.<br />The billionaire’s Cascade Investment LLC agreed Friday to team up with  Blackstone Group Inc.  and private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners in a $4.7 billion deal for  Signature Aviation  PLC. The deal would boost Cascade’s stake in the world’s largest operator of private-jet bases to 30%, from a previous 19%.<br />Commercial flying in much of the world has fallen sharply amid travel restrictions, quarantine rules and steep reductions in flights operated by cash-strapped airlines. Private-jet travel has bounced back quicker. For individuals and companies who can afford it, a private jet offers a way to limit close-quarters exposure to other passengers, as well as providing service to destinations that have been abandoned by airlines.<br />U.K.-based Signature Aviation said in November that demand had stabilized at 80% of 2019 levels. In comparison, global commercial airlines were operating at around one-third of pre-pandemic capacity then.<br />The move comes after more than a year of jostling between the three firms, drawn by the relatively quick recovery in demand for private jets. Blackstone and GIP had previously been engaged in a bidding war for the company."
