    "body": "Protesters in Iran’s impoverished southeast clashed with security forces for a third consecutive day, in the latest challenge for a government facing public resentment over widespread economic hardship in the country.<br />A crowd attacked a police station in the city of Saravan with grenades and light arms on Thursday, killing one policeman before security forces repelled the rioters, the government said.<br />The unrest erupted earlier this week when protesters stormed a local governor’s building and another police station. Those incidents came in response to Revolutionary Guard patrols firing at alleged fuel smugglers crossing the Pakistani border, killing at least 10 people, according to rights activists in the area.<br />Iran’s presidential chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi this week blamed Pakistani border guards for the shooting, saying they had fired at smugglers who intended to use border points designated for fuel traders. The government said two or three people had died.<br />A senior Pakistani official said he wasn’t aware of any formal complaint or allegation from Iran against his country’s forces, and that Pakistani troops hadn’t opened fire."
