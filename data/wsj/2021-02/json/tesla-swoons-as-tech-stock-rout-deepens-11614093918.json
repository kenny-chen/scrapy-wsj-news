    "body": "Tech stocks bounced back from their worst open in months Tuesday, after prepared testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cooled the rate fears that have fueled a late February rout.<br />Many major stocks were down but only modestly so.  Tesla Inc.  had fallen 2% after dropping as much as 12% in early trading, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1% after an early decline of 4% put it on track for its worst day since September. The index is down 6% from its peak Feb. 12, as rising U.S. interest rates prompt a broad re-evaluation of investor growth expectations, and on track for a sixth straight declineâ€”its longest pullback in a year.<br />Tesla, whose 743% surge last year highlighted the tech-led market rebound from the coronavirus selloff, is now down for 2021 and has lost a quarter of its value since the electric-car maker said on Feb. 8 that it had spent $1.5 billion on bitcoin in an effort to boost returns on cash.<br />Other investor favorites were also recovering after being hit hard in early trading.  Moderna Inc.,  the maker of a major Covid-19 vaccine, was down 7% after falling as much as 13%.  Apple Inc.  dropped 2% and  Amazon.com Inc.  fell 1%.<br />The tech companies have emerged as favorites among small investors who have piled into stock and options trading over the past year, with the Nasdaq rising 44% in 2020. But the scale of the rally has prompted concerns that many of the stocks are overvalued, making them vulnerable to sudden slumps."
