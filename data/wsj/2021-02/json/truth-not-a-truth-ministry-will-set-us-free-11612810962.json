    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Liberalism’s Ministry of Truth” (Feb. 4): I am struck again by how much closer our political environment is now to that described in George Orwell’s book “1984” than when I first read it in the 1960s. I recently reread it and found disturbing how rapidly we are moving to the world Orwell imagined. Anyone who read “1984” years ago and forgot about it should reread it now. It is depressingly prescient.<br />James R. Daniel<br />Fredericksburg, Va.<br /><br />I find your editorial extremely frustrating, especially after reading that the Republican members of the House did nothing to rebuke Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s opinions that have been broadcast on social media and in the news over the past few years. Your editorial gives people like her free rein to express whatever they choose. I won’t pass judgment on content, only that there has to be a filter for information that is false, slanderous, racist, derogatory and inflaming."
