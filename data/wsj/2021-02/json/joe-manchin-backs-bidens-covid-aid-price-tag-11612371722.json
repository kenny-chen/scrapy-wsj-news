    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Joe Manchin said he would support the nearly $2 trillion price tag for President Biden’s coronavirus-relief package. Now Democrats will just have to keep him on board.<br />“If it’s $1.9 trillion, so be it,” Mr. Manchin said on MSNBC. “If it’s a little smaller than that and we find a targeted need, then that’s what we’re going to do.”<br />The comments from the centrist Democrat from West Virginia provided a boost to party leaders as they pursue passing a relief bill without Republican votes. But they also underscored the power that a 50-50 Senate grants individual senators. Mr. Manchin is still seeking more-targeted aid payments and a smaller increase in the federal minimum wage than what Mr. Biden proposed.<br />Mr. Manchin said he is still talking with Republicans, and that he wanted the process to be bipartisan, including giving both parties the chance to amend the legislation.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday that there will be an “open, bipartisan amendment process” as the chamber debates Democrats’ budget resolution over the next two days. He invited Republicans to participate. But he reiterated his party is committed to passing a big rescue package quickly."
