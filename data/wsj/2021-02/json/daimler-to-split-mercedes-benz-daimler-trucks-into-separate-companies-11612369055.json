    "body": "BERLIN— Daimler AG  plans to spin off its trucks business, in a move highlighting how conventional auto makers are under pressure to boost their stock-market value.<br />Daimler said Wednesday it would hand over a “significant majority” of shares in its business that makes trucks and buses to company shareholders by the end of the year. It also plans to eventually make Mercedes-Benz the name of the car-making business, which in future would focus on developing luxury electric cars and automotive software.<br />Investors applauded the news, driving Daimler’s shares up nearly 9% in trading in Frankfurt.<br />Echoing arguments that investors have made for years, Daimler’s top executive, Ola Källenius, said the two vehicle businesses were quite distinct, with different customers, technologies and financial requirements.<br />“Both companies operate in industries that are facing major technological and structural changes. Given this context, we believe they will be able to operate most effectively as independent entities,” Mr. Källenius said."
