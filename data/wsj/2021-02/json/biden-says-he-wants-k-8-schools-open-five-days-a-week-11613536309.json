    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden said he expects a “significant percentage” of K-8 schools to reopen five days a week within his first 100 days in office, after the White House said last week that its pledge to open schools would be met by in-person instruction one day a week.<br />The president said in a town-hall meeting televised by CNN Tuesday that many schools may seek to remain open during the summer, and he urged that teachers be vaccinated to speed the return to in-person learning. “We should move them up in the hierarchy,” he said.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week that the administration’s pledge to reopen most K-8 schools by the end of 100 days would be satisfied by having in-person instruction at least one day a week in most schools by then. She later said this wasn’t a ceiling, but a bar they were trying to exceed.<br />Republicans and some parents called the threshold unacceptably low.<br />Mr. Biden, asked about the comments during the town hall at a Milwaukee theater, called it a “mistake in the communication” and said he had been pushing for opening most K-8 schools, which he called “the easiest to open, the most needed to be open.”"
