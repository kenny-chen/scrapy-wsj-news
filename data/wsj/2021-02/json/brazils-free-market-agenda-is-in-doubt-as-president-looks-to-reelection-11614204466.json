    "body": "SÃO PAULO—Brazilian Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who only two years ago promised to lead a free-market revolution in Latin America’s biggest country, has increasingly found himself relegated to damage control as President Jair Bolsonaro deepens the state’s role in the economy.<br />Mr. Guedes’s mission of lowering public debt and building investor confidence in Brazil took a hit after the country’s right-wing leader on Friday nominated a new chief of state oil company  Petróleo Brasileiro  S.A, or Petrobras, spurring investor flight this week from the country’s equities and currency.<br />With his focus on reelection next year, Mr. Bolsonaro, a former army captain who has publicly said he knew nothing about economics, nominated a fellow military man to the company’s helm after the current chief executive refused to lower fuel prices.<br />Petrobras said Tuesday it would schedule a meeting to assess the president’s nomination of a new CEO.<br />“It’s now clear that the president himself does not have a commitment to a liberal economic agenda as people once thought, even though his finance minister does,” said Bernard Appy, a former economic secretary at the ministry."
