    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Quick. What brilliant musician do you associate with “Take the ‘A’ Train”? If you said Duke Ellington, you’d be half right. His band made it famous. But, unlike the bulk of his band’s repertory, Ellington didn’t compose it—that honor belongs to Billy Strayhorn, his longtime writing and arranging partner.<br />This stirring dance number, as recorded on Feb. 15, 1941, marked Strayhorn’s breakthrough as a composer. Opening or closing countless concerts with it, Ellington made it his band’s signature tune. Noted musicians have told me that, even after hearing it hundreds of times, they never tire of its masterly construction and swinging exuberance—it always seems familiar yet fresh."
