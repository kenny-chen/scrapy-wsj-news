    "body": "Regarding Peggy Noonan’s “A Vote to Acquit Is a Vote for a Lie” (Declarations, Feb. 13): Hard to argue Peggy Noonan’s points, but what if the circumstances had been reversed and President Trump had won and those voters disappointed with the results stormed the Capitol? Think of the summer’s BLM rioters. How would the narrative have changed? Would they be called insurrectionists or American heroes democratically voicing their rights against an illegitimate president? The woman who was shot and killed, whom no one grieves for in the media, would be the new George Floyd. The officer who shot her would be under investigation and on administrative leave. The president would have been impeached for failing to protect the Capitol; the story would haunt us for four more years in the media. There is no excuse for what happened on Jan. 6, but a reason it happened is the double standard allowed for the left and the media.<br />Ed Jenkins<br />Camarillo, Calif.<br /><br />No country-club, genteel Republican will win national office again, only fighters like Donald Trump. Donald Trump left office with knives and arrows stuck in his back from Democrats, the media and Republicans alike. Yes, I want Republicans and conservatives who will stand up against the abuse sent our way. Donald Trump did that, whether Peggy Noonan approved or not."
