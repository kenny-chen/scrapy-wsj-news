    "body": "Democrats and a former CIA chief have criticized President Biden’s decision not to directly punish Saudi Arabia’s crown prince for his alleged role in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.<br />The Biden administration on Friday released a report fingering Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, for the direct role he played in the 2018 assassination of Mr. Khashoggi. The administration sanctioned a top aide to the crown prince as well as the so-called rapid intervention force that played a role in the murder but stopped short of punishing Prince Mohammed, known as MBS, for ordering the operation that led to Mr. Khashoggi’s death.<br />Former CIA Director John Brennan, who served in the Obama administration, suggested the administration limit contact with the crown prince.<br />“Saying that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was responsible for the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi is not holding him accountable,” Mr. Brennan wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “The Biden administration needs to do much more. No meetings with senior U.S. officials and no visits to the U.S. would be a good start.”<br />House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, (D., Calif.), wrote over the weekend that the crown prince “has blood on his hands” and the U.S. “must have accountability.”"
