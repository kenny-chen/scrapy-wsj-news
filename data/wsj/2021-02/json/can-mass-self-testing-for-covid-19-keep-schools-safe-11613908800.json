    "body": "BERLINâ€”On a continent still struggling with high Covid-19 rates, one small Alpine country is trying something new to reopen its schools: Require that students test themselves twice a week before they can attend class.<br />The experiment could bear valuable lessons for the U.S., where many schools remain closed, especially because it is happening in a place with relatively high infection rates despite months of restrictions.<br />The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week urged elementary and secondary schools to reopen amid a debate between parents, teachers and local governments over how they should operate during the pandemic.<br />In Europe, where some countries are reopening schools after winter shutdowns, more governments are pushing in-school testing as they try to balance a growing urgency to get children back into classrooms with fears about the new highly infectious virus variants.<br />Austria, which this month reopened schools after nearly three months, is taking this further than any other European country."
