    "body": "<br />Microsoft Corp.  and  Apple Inc . , No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in the Management Top 250  ranking for 2020, are among just eight companies designated as all-stars for their performance in all five of the ranking’s main components.<br />The Management Top 250 ranking, developed by the Drucker Institute, measures corporate effectiveness by examining performance in five categories: customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength.<br />Eight companies scored at least one standard deviation above the mean in all five  categories, meaning their scores were in the top 15% to 20% for more than 800 companies studied by Drucker. Most of these all-stars are technology companies, but Procter & Gamble Co., Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co. also made the cut.<br />In addition to its top overall score, Microsoft had the highest scores for social responsibility and financial strength."
