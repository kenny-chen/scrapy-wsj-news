    "body": "WASHINGTON—Hunter Biden, the son of President Biden whose overseas business ties received intense scrutiny from Republicans during the 2020 campaign, plans to release a memoir this spring.<br />The book, “Beautiful Things,” will be released April 6 and focus on his “descent into substance abuse and his tortuous path to sobriety,” Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, announced Thursday. The publisher didn’t release financial terms of the book.<br />Hunter Biden kept a relatively low profile during the presidential campaign, then appeared prominently at his father’s side when he declared victory and again on Inauguration Day. The release of his book is likely to return him further to the public spotlight.<br />The younger Mr. Biden, who turned 51 on Thursday, is an attorney and businessman. His service on the board of a Ukrainian energy during and after his father’s tenure as vice president has drawn wide criticism and was a central issue in the first impeachment of President Donald Trump. He faces a federal criminal tax investigation, for which he has denied any wrongdoing, and has drawn scrutiny for his business dealings with European and Chinese tycoons, some of whom were eager to be associated with the Biden family name.<br />The Wall Street Journal first reported in Sept. 2019 that Mr. Trump had repeatedly pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden, saying that he was engaged in corrupt activities. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump and his allies argued that Joe Biden, while vice president, had sought the removal of Ukraine’s top prosecutor to protect the gas company, Burisma Holdings, from investigation."
