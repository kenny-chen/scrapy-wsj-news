    "body": "North Korean hackers are increasingly focusing their criminal activity on the world of cryptocurrency and have recently built malicious cryptocurrency apps, launched ransomware attacks, and even promoted a fraudulent initial coin offering in pursuit of digital cash, the Justice Department said Wednesday.<br />Federal prosecutors provided the new details in a grand jury indictment returned in December and unsealed on Wednesday, charging two alleged members of North Korea’s military intelligence services, Jon Chang Hyok and Kim Il, with a wide-ranging scheme that included attempts to steal $1.3 billion over the past half-decade for Pyongyang.<br />A third man, Park Jin Hyok, who is also named in the indictment, was previously charged in a September 2018 case that accused him of playing a role in the 2016 theft of $81 million from Bangladesh’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, among other intrusions.<br />The hackers also allegedly sent spear phishing emails to employees at the State and Defense Departments and multiple U.S. technology companies in January and February 2020, the indictment said.<br />The charges chronicle a criminal moneymaking operation that has mirrored the general public’s increasing interest in digital currencies, as bitcoin has topped the $50,000 mark."
