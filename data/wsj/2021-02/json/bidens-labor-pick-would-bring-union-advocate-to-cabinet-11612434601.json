    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s pick for Labor Department secretary, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, would bring a champion of organized labor to the White House cabinet.<br />Mr. Walsh, who is set to testify at a Thursday Senate hearing on his confirmation, is expected to pursue the administration’s labor goals, including efforts to recover millions of jobs lost last year, expanding who qualifies for overtime pay and pressing Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.<br />He also is expected to pursue the administration’s plans to boost labor unions, a promise Mr. Biden made while campaigning for president.<br />At a Jan. 8 press briefing, Mr. Biden said Mr. Walsh “always puts American working people first” and that he “understands like I do the middle class built this country and unions built the middle class.”<br />Thursday’s hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will bring Mr. Walsh one step closer to a full Senate confirmation vote."
