    "body": "Georgia’s attorney general was asked to review a case against a voter-registration group previously headed by Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, which allegedly was slow to submit more than 1,200 voter-registration applications in 2019.<br />The State Election Board voted on Wednesday to refer the case concerning the New Georgia Project to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, a Republican, the secretary of state’s office said. Republican members of the board voted 3-0, after the sole Democratic member recused himself and the secretary of state didn’t vote on the matter.<br />The attorney general can recommend certain penalties, such as fines or a letter of reprimand, or to take no action, according to the secretary of state’s office.<br />Nsé Ufot, chief executive of the New Georgia Project, defended the group’s voter-registration efforts. “We have not received any information on this matter from the Secretary or any other Georgia official,” Ms. Ufot said in a statement.<br />A spokesman for Mr. Warnock declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Carr said the office can’t comment on active matters."
