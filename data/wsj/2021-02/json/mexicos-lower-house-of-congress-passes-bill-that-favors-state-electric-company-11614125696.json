    "body": "MEXICO CITY—Mexico’s lower house of congress passed a controversial bill that gives priority to the state-owned power utility over private generators, threatening to overturn the electricity market and putting billions of dollars of private investments in jeopardy.<br />Lower house lawmakers voted 304-179 to pass the bill that cancels key parts of the 2013 energy overhaul giving private and foreign investors a greater role in the electricity sector.<br />The ruling Morena Party backed the legislation, which was submitted early this month by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a fervent opponent of the energy opening made under his predecessor.<br />Mexico’s main opposition party, the conservative National Action Party, said the changes would push up generation costs and electricity rates, prove detrimental to the environment and unleash international arbitration and constitutional challenges.<br />Opposition lawmakers objected to a number of articles in the bill, although the objections were expected to be overruled by the majority. The bill will then go to the Senate, where approval is almost guaranteed, said Senate Majority Leader Ricardo Monreal."
