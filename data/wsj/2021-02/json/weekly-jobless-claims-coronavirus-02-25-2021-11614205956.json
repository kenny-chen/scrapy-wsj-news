    "body": "Filings for initial unemployment claims have held at a high level since the start of the year and could for a few weeks be affected by job disruptions from severe winter storms across the country.<br />Economists project initial jobless claims to regular state programs, a proxy for layoffs, to hold nearly steady for the week ended Feb. 20, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. The Labor Department will publish the latest data at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday.<br />The four-week moving average, which smooths out week-to-week fluctuations, was 833,000 in the week ended Feb. 13, within the roughly 750,000 to 850,000 range that has held since last October and above the pre-pandemic peak.<br />The recent data is broadly consistent with a labor market that has been stuck near neutral this winter, while other readings of the economy have pointed to a pickup.<br />Jobless claims are closely watched by policy makers and investors about the direction of the jobs market and overall economy, but winter storms that hit Texas and elsewhere could affect layoff trends in the short term. The storms, which caused widespread power outages and disruptions, could create temporary unemployment for some workers and may have made it difficult for people to file claims and for state governments to process them."
