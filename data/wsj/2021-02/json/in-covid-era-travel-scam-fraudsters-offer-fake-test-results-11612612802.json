    "body": "In many parts of the world, travelers must show a negative Covid-19 test before catching a flight, but a number of recent arrests suggest the results won’t all be authentic.<br />Authorities in Indonesia, France and the U.K. say they have arrested the purveyors of falsified coronavirus tests.<br />“As long as travel restrictions remain in place due to the Covid-19 situation, it is highly likely that production and sales of fake test certificates will prevail,” Europol, the European Union’s law-enforcement agency, said this month.<br />Allegations of Covid-19 testing fraud have been cropping up around the world. A man was arrested outside of London Luton Airport in late January in connection with the sale of bogus Covid-19 test certificates.<br />In November, French authorities arrested seven people for selling false certificates to travelers at Charles de Gaulle Airport, near Paris. Police first got wind of the fraud after discovering a passenger with a fake certificate on a flight to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. After the arrests, police found on the suspects’ phones more than 200 fake certificates, which allowed people to fly internationally, according to French prosecutors."
