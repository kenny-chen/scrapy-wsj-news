    "body": "Millions of Americans remained without power for a third consecutive day, as another winter storm began blanketing parts of the South with more snow and freezing rain.<br />The new storm, which will move toward the East Coast later this week, will prolong icy conditions in some areas hit earlier this week by an Arctic blast of subzero temperatures and snow, according to the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center.<br />Predictions show snowfall of four inches and above from Oklahoma to the mid-Atlantic region, with Pennsylvania potentially seeing eight inches or more later this week. “Significant freezing rain is also likely from Texas to Tennessee and North Carolina to Virginia,” the weather service said on  Twitter ,  adding that parts of Texas, Mississippi and the Mid-Atlantic could accumulate swaths of ice a half-inch thick.<br />Hazardous weather will move into the Florida panhandle and the Carolinas on Thursday, including the possibility of tornadoes, the NWS warned. Ahead of the storm, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued a state of emergency, which will allow for quicker repairs to downed lines and other utility issues.<br />“This forecast for icy weather is a real threat for widespread power outages,” the Democrat said Wednesday. “People need to be ready to stay home and be prepared to lose power for a while.”"
