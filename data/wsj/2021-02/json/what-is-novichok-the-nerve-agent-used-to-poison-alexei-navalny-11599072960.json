    "body": "Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny was sentenced to serve about 3½ years in prison following his return from Germany where he was transported after a near fatal poisoning attempt last August. Prosecutors had requested that a suspended sentence Mr. Navalny received in 2014 be turned into real prison time, for what authorities said was repeated violations of the terms of his parole, including when he was recuperating in a Berlin hospital. The 3½-year sentence credits the time Mr. Navalny served under house, leaving him to serve 32 months behind bars. European authorities say Novichok, a military-grade chemical nerve agent, was used in the attack against the political activist.<br />It is a deadly nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union and then Russia as a more potent and harder-to-detect alternative to VX and soman. Its existence was first revealed in the early 1990s by a dissident scientist as Moscow prepared to enter the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention to end the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons.<br />Novichok is carried in two parts that are combined to create a viscous liquid just before it is administered—making it difficult to detect. It disrupts the way nerve cells communicate with each other, interfering with muscle control and potentially causing respiratory and cardiac arrest. Once deployed, it remains dangerous in the environment for months, if not longer.<br />They include breathlessness, muscle pain, nausea and vomiting, incontinence and mental confusion.<br />The most effective treatment for Novichok poisoning is atropine, which is derived from the belladonna plant, or deadly nightshade. It isn’t a cure, but if applied quickly it can block the effects of nerve agents. Soldiers likely to be attacked with chemical weapons often carry supplies to inject into their thighs."
