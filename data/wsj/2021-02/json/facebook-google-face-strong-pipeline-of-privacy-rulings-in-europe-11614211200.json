    "body": "The privacy regulator overseeing  Facebook Inc.,   Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and  Apple Inc.  in the European Union expects to boost its tally of big tech decisions this year—and rejects complaints that its enforcement has been too slow.<br />Helen Dixon, who leads Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, said her office is on track to make draft decisions in roughly half a dozen privacy cases involving big technology companies this year, compared with just two last year.<br />“The pipeline is very strong. The momentum is building in terms of concluding these inquiries,” Ms. Dixon said in an interview.<br />Ms. Dixon is one of the world’s most influential privacy regulators because the data commission she leads is in charge enforcing the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, for companies that have their regional headquarters in Ireland.<br />Two cases, involving Facebook, are already on Ms. Dixon’s desk for draft decisions, she said. Five others, including one involving Google and others involving Facebook subsidiaries, are nearing the end of their investigations, with final reports either submitted to the companies for a final round of comments or received back, she added."
