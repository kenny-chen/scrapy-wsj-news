    "body": "To help explain the complexities of the GameStop market frenzy, Brianna Parkins turned to two tall cans of Guinness, a sad-looking gray dog puppet and a pile of candy.<br />In her series of short TikTok explainers, Ms. Parkins casts the puppet as a hedge-fund manager looking to short a can of Guinness, reaping profits (that would be the candy) along the way. A white plaster statue enters the scene—representing the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets—and buys up not one, but two cans of Guinness. “This is bad news for your hedge funds,” she says, waving the puppet to the camera.<br />Her series has drawn nearly three million views. “With something like short selling, it can sound like gibberish, quite theoretical and jargon-heavy. You get more and more lost with the more words you don’t understand,” said Ms. Parkins, a Dublin-based journalist for Ireland AM, in an interview.<br />As the Reddit-fueled rally and subsequent tumble took Wall Street by storm, people everywhere struggled to make sense of the market movements behind the headlines.<br />Rather than ignore the moment, the internet took it and swallowed it whole. Creators of TikTok videos, memes and other internet quips enlisted Beanie Babies, “Real Housewives” and Target dresses to shed some light on key financial concepts needed to grasp the situation—short selling, the short squeeze and how options work."
