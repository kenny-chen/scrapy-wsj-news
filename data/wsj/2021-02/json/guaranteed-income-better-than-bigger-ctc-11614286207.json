    "body": "Regarding Greg Ip’s column “Capital Account: Child Tax Credit vs. Universal Basic Income” (U.S. News, Feb. 18): An option not discussed is guaranteed income, a payment targeted to the poor and middle class. It is preferable to a UBI or CTC in that it goes only to those who need it. And it addresses the fact that not all families include children, but all deserve financial stability.<br />Guaranteed income recognizes that no child should live in poverty; and it goes beyond that to also say that no American deserves to live in poverty. We are the wealthiest country in the world, and it is a global embarrassment that we allow millions of children and adults to go hungry or without a roof over their heads. A guaranteed income is the most direct and efficient way to rid America of the pandemic of poverty.<br />Michael Tubbs<br />Stockton, Calif.<br />Mr. Tubbs is the founder of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income and a former mayor of Stockton, Calif."
