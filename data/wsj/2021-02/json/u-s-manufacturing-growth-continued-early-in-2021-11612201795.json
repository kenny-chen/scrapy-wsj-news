    "body": "U.S. manufacturing continued to recover in January, a bright spot for the U.S. economy as services companies continue to struggle with the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Two purchasing managers surveys on manufacturing activity released Monday pointed to continued growth, adding to evidence a pickup in demand for goods is helping U.S. factories.<br />The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index ticked lower in January, to 58.7 from 60.5 in December, but remained in growth mode. A reading above 50 indicates activity is expanding across the manufacturing sector, while below 50 signals contraction.<br />While the pace of expansion slowed slightly last month, Tim Fiore, who oversees the ISM survey of factory purchasing and supply managers, said he is “feeling really bullish” about 2021, adding “the issue is how long it’s going to take to get the vaccine deployed” to ease strains in attracting and retaining labor at companies and facilities.<br />Meanwhile, a final January  IHS Markit  manufacturing survey for the U.S. released Monday rose to 59.2, from 57.1 in December. That was the index’s highest reading since the series began in 2007, as output and new orders rose."
