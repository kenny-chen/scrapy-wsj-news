    "body": "Rising bond yields pose an outsize threat to one asset class in particular: ultra-long-dated debt.<br />Hopes of a fast economic recovery have given bonds their worst start to the year since 2015. Last October, 10-year Treasury yields were under 0.7%. Now, they hover around 1.5%. The jump has started to dent stocks: The S&P 500 fell 2.4% Thursday.<br />Markets still benefit from very loose financial conditions in inflation-adjusted terms, and the Federal Reserve made clear this week it won’t allow yields to go too high. That offers protection to stock investors, and even most bondholders.<br />The exceptions may be investors that bought debt issues maturing in 50 or more years’ time, particularly those with slim coupons.<br />So far, the big yield shifts are happening at shorter maturities. Yet France’s new 50-year government bond, issued on Jan. 26, has still lost 15% of its value. Over the same period, Austria’s latest 100-year bond has lost 21%. Their yields have only risen 0.4 percentage points."
