    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Chicago Teachers Union vs. Biden” (Jan. 26): After all these years of insisting that the classroom is the only place to educate our children, it’s fascinating to learn that the CTU now opposes the classroom learning model. Looks like another illogical example of the self-serving actions of the teachers and their unions. I hope this home learning will increase in popularity and start a rising movement of home schooling without the confines of the schools and the union-indoctrinated teachers.<br />Robert L. Keirstead<br />Durham, N.H.<br /><br />You write: “Even a federal bribe isn’t enough to get them back teaching in classrooms.” Maybe the solution is for Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to fire the teachers just as President Ronald Reagan fired the striking air-traffic controllers in 1981."
