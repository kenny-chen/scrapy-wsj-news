    "body": "WASHINGTON—A dispute over the choice of a top banking regulator is highlighting fault lines among Democrats—on issues from racial diversity to ties to the Obama administration—as President Biden fills out his leadership team.<br />Michael Barr, an Obama and Clinton administration alumnus who leads the University of Michigan’s public policy school, is the leading contender to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees companies including  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and  Wells Fargo  & Co.<br />But some progressive Democrats are making a last-ditch effort to install Mehrsa Baradaran, an Iranian-born law professor at the University of California, Irvine and author of “The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap.”<br />Their records suggest that Mr. Barr and Ms. Baradaran are likely to pursue racial equity and expand financial services in low-income communities. Several progressives, including Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, have lined up to support Ms. Baradaran, while others back Mr. Barr. Mr. Brown chairs the Senate Banking Committee, which will have to green-light the eventual nominee.<br />Mr. Biden has emphasized building a diverse leadership team that “looks like America” and has made a number of barrier-breaking selections, including former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen as the first woman to lead the Treasury Department."
