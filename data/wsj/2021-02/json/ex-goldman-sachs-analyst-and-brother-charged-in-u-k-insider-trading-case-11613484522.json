    "body": "A former  Goldman Sachs  Group Inc. analyst and his lawyer brother were criminally charged by the U.K. financial regulator Tuesday with fraud and insider trading after allegedly profiting from information about deals Goldman worked on.<br />Mohammed Zina, 32 years old, was an analyst in the conflicts resolution group at Goldman Sachs when he allegedly used confidential information at the bank to make the equivalent of almost $200,000, or £142,000, with his brother on stock trades. He pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to the charges brought by the Financial Conduct Authority.<br />His brother, Suhail Zina, 33 years old and a former lawyer at Clifford Chance LLP, didn’t enter a plea and his lawyer declined to comment. Both were released on bail.<br />A Goldman Sachs spokesman said protecting client information is of paramount importance and that the bank isn’t part of the proceedings. He said Goldman has been assisting the FCA. A Clifford Chance spokesman said Suhail Zina left in 2018, and said the global law firm isn’t part of the proceedings.<br />The FCA said the charges involve stock trades in six U.K. companies including chip designer ARM Holdings PLC and business lender Shawbrook PLC, between July 15, 2016, and Dec. 4, 2017."
