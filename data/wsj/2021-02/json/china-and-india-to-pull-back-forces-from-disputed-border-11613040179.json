    "body": "NEW DELHI—India and China said they would pull back their security forces along part of their disputed border in the Himalayas, a move that could help ease monthslong tensions between the world’s two most populous countries.<br />Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh told lawmakers in Parliament on Thursday that the two countries had agreed on a phased disengagement around Pangong Lake, where they have overlapping claims.<br />Both sides have agreed that their security forces around the lake would gradually retreat to the positions they held before the border tensions flared up last year. The sides agreed that temporary structures and infrastructure built since April would be removed and that patrolling in disputed territories would be suspended, Mr. Singh said.<br />The movement of troops began on Wednesday and won’t result in ceding any land formerly controlled by India, he said.<br />China announced Wednesday a synchronized disengagement of front-line troops from the north and south banks of the picturesque lake."
