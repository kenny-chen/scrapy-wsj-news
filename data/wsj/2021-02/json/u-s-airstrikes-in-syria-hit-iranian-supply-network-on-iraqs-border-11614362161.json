Mr. Abu Layla described the base as “the logistical hub of the region.”<br />Kata’ib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Shiite militant group, said one of its members was killed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, said 22 militia members died, citing unidentified sources.<br />The American strike was a response to a rocket attack earlier this month on a U.S. air base in northern Iraq that killed a military contractor and injured others. A U.S. service member was among the wounded. A Shiite militia group claimed responsibility for the attack."
