    "body": "TEL AVIV—The Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  is equally effective across all age groups, including those over 60, according to a new Israeli study, in a boost of confidence to global vaccine efforts.<br />The Pfizer vaccine provided around 94% protection against developing coronavirus symptoms across all age groups above 16 a week after the second shot of a recommended two-dose regimen, according to a study by researchers from Israel’s Clalit Research Institute and Harvard University. The study also found the vaccine is 92% effective in preventing severe disease.<br />The results are in line with the vaccine maker’s own clinical trial, but the large size of the study, which covered nearly 1.2 million people, provides more precise insight into older age groups that were sparsely covered by the drugmaker’s trial, according to the study’s authors.<br />The peer-reviewed study, parts of which have been reported previously, was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.<br />Israel is the only country that has begun vaccinating all age groups over 16 in relatively large numbers, as part of its campaign to inoculate a majority of its nine-million population by March."
