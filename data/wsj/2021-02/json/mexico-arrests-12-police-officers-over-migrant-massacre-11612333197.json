    "body": "MEXICO CITY—Twelve Mexican state police officers from the northern border state of Tamaulipas have been arrested in connection with a recent massacre of 19 people, most of whom appear to be Guatemalan migrants headed for the U.S., Tamaulipas’s attorney general said Tuesday night.<br />Late last month, 19 charred bodies were found in two burned vehicles on a road in Camargo, a town across from the Texas border where organized crime groups are fighting for control of routes used to smuggle drugs as well as illegal migrants. It was the latest grisly discovery in a country beset by organized crime.<br />The 12 state police are being charged with homicide, abuse of authority and giving false information, Irving Barrios, the Tamaulipas attorney general, told a news conference.<br />The alleged involvement of so many police officers in the killing spotlights the continuing endemic corruption of Mexico’s local and state police forces.<br />The corruption in this case could also go higher. Mexico’s federal government said it was investigating why one of the vehicles where the migrants were found dead had been seized by federal migration officials in a raid in December."
