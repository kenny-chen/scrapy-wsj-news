    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House has begun outreach to gun control advocates as it works to address President Biden’s ambitious campaign promises on an issue that has long proved politically challenging for Democrats.<br />Ahead of the anniversary of the 2018 Parkland school shooting on Sunday, Mr. Biden’s plans are receiving fresh attention. Gun policy wasn’t part of his first round of executive orders, but advocacy groups said they were encouraged by White House outreach so far.<br />Domestic policy adviser Susan Rice and White House public engagement director Cedric Richmond met virtually with gun-control groups Wednesday, stressing their commitment to taking what they called “common-sense steps.” Activists are pushing for legislative moves, including an expanded background check bill, as well as items the president could pursue without the closely divided Congress, including appointing a senior aide tasked with gun-policy oversight and pursuing stricter enforcement of existing rules.<br />“I get it. Covid should be the top priority—one through 10,” said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jamie, was killed in the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead and another 17 wounded.<br />Mr. Guttenberg was part of a call Thursday with Ms. Rice and Mr. Richmond and other Parkland families. After the 90-minute conversation, he said, “I get the impression, even with more definitive clarity, that this is something that they intend to lead on.”"
