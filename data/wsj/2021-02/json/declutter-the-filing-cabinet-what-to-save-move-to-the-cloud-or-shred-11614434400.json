    "body": "When was the last time you cleaned up the family filing cabinet? Be honest. If you’re like me, that unsightly metal rectangle is probably overstuffed with old utility bills, medical records and tax returns. With tax season under way and extra time at home, it isn’t a bad time to do some spring cleaning.<br />So what should you keep in the filing cabinet, what should you scan and save in the cloud, and what should you just toss in the shredder? I consulted experts in several fields to find out.<br />Tax documents. Individuals only need to keep tax returns and related documents for three years from the date the original return was filed, according to the Internal Revenue Service. There are some exceptions and different periods of limitations for filing refund claims listed here.<br />There are some records you should hold on to even longer, said Andy Phillips, a director at H&R Block’s Tax Institute. For example, if you’ve made improvements to a home you own and rent out, it’s wise to keep records of all repairs and new appliances so you can determine your cost basis when you sell the property.<br />However, you don’t have to keep paper versions of these. Mr. Phillips said it’s fine to produce digital records in the event of an IRS audit."
