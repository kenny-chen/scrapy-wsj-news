    "body": "Virginia is poised to become the latest state to ban capital punishment after both houses of the Democratic-led legislature voted to repeal the death penalty.<br />Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam has said he would sign the bill, which would make Virginia the 23rd state, and the first in the South, to abolish capital punishment.<br />The Virginia bill’s passage marks a further erosion of support for the death penalty in the U.S. It also adds to the growing list of progressive measures gaining approval in Virginia since Democrats won control of the state legislature in the 2019 elections.<br />Virginia’s House of Delegates voted 57-41 to abolish the death penalty Friday, two days after the state Senate backed a repeal more narrowly along party lines.<br />Virginia has put to death 113 inmates since 1976, when capital punishment was reinstated in the U.S. after the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a research organization critical of the death penalty. Only Texas has put to death more inmates during that period."
