    "body": "Graphics-chip maker  Nvidia Corp.  posted record quarterly revenue, capping a year dominated by pandemic-fueled demand for its chips as the company grappled with supply shortages.<br />Nvidia on Wednesday reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $5 billion, up 61% from a year earlier, generating $2.31 in earnings a share. It also said it expects about $5.3 billion in revenue for the current quarter, ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.<br />Demand for some of Nvidia’s chips has been so hot that it has outpaced the company’s ability to increase production, adding to chip-supply shortages riling the semiconductor industry.<br />Nvidia’s newest graphics cards were a holiday sensation, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said during an earnings call. She added that some inventories are likely to remain low in the first quarter even as Nvidia increases supply. “Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components,” Ms. Kress said.<br />President Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order directing a broad review of supply chains for semiconductors and other critical materials."
