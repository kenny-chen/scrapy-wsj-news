    "body": "A wave of selling in U.S. government bonds intensified on Thursday, sending yields soaring after new data indicated a strengthening economic recovery and an auction of seven-year Treasurys met with tepid demand from investors.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note reached as high as 1.539% before finishing Thursday’s session at 1.513%, according to Tradeweb—its highest level in a year and up from 1.388% at Wednesday’s close.<br />Moves were also pronounced in shorter-dated bonds. The five-year yield rose to 0.799% Thursday from its previous close of 0.612%—the largest one day gain since December 2010.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed after Labor Department data showed that the number of jobless claims fell sharply last week, signaling the job market could be stabilizing after layoffs edged higher earlier in the winter.<br />Investors tend to sell Treasurys when they expect faster growth and inflation, which lowers the value of bonds’ fixed payments and can eventually lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates."
