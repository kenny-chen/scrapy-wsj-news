    "body": "Investigators in Indonesia are seeking to uncover why a Sriwijaya Air jet crashed into the sea shortly after taking off on Jan. 9. The incident involving a  Boeing  737-500 came more than two years after a Lion Air plane went down in the country, resulting in 189 deaths.<br />The Sriwijaya Air jet crashed into the Java Sea minutes after it took off from Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta. It was carrying 62 people, including 10 children, on a domestic flight to Pontianak, a city on Indonesia’s Borneo island.<br />The plane departed at 2:36 p.m. and climbed to a maximum altitude of 10,900 feet about four minutes later before beginning a steep descent, according to Indonesian investigators. It went missing at 2:40 p.m.<br />Divers and search crew located debris from the plane and human remains around an area known as the Thousand Islands, to the north of Jakarta. There were no survivors.<br />Investigations are under way and, at this stage, rely in large part on information downloaded from the flight-data recorder. That is one of the plane’s two so-called black boxes and was retrieved a few days after the aircraft went down."
