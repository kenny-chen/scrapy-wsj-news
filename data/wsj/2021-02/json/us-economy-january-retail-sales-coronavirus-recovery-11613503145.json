    "body": "U.S. shoppers likely boosted their spending in January, buoyed by the stimulus payments that many Americans received in the most recent $900 billion Covid-19 relief package.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimated that retail sales—a measure of spending at stores, vehicle dealerships, restaurants and online—increased a seasonally adjusted 1.2% in January from a month earlier. The projected rise would follow three consecutive months of declining sales during the 2020 holiday shopping season.<br />Robert Rosener, senior U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, forecasts the report “will be the start of exiting the worst of the softer data winter we’ve seen,” with the $600-a-recipient stimulus checks distributed in early January the main factor driving an uptick in spending.<br />Still, he said he expects spending was uneven across sectors last month, with categories like apparel and restaurants continuing to suffer from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and social-distancing measures. The U.S. experienced a sharp surge in coronavirus cases after the holidays.<br />Allen Merry said he used his recent stimulus check to buy a used acoustic guitar from a local musical instrument shop."
