    "body": "Nearly a year after Covid-19 first tore through New York, the outlook for a rebound in economic activity is partly tied to the ease and availability of testing for the disease.<br />In a bid to speed up a reopening, the New York City Economic Development Corp. is investing in a rapid Covid-19 test that was initially developed for use to reopen the Columbia University campus.<br />This week, the EDC is expected to announce that a team from Columbia University, led by Dr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, is the first awardee in a continuing competition to develop a point-of-care or at-home Covid-19 test.<br />Dr. Ho’s team is expected to begin seeking emergency-use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the antigen test this week, he said in an interview. The city’s EDC is awarding Dr. Ho $164,000 in funding to support additional studies of the test, which is formatted like a home pregnancy test and delivers results in about 10 to 15 minutes.<br />The hope is that once authorized, tests would be available directly to the city, without passing through federal or state channels, according to an official for the EDC."
