    "body": "The number of workers seeking unemployment benefits fell to 779,000 last week, a sign that layoffs have started to ease following an increase in early January.<br />The decline in the week ended Jan. 30 marked the third week of lower filings. But it leaves initial claims—a proxy for layoffs—at a higher weekly level than before the winter surge in coronavirus cases.<br />Weekly claims had increased since November, when they were consistently below a seasonally adjusted 800,000, to reach 927,000 during the week of Jan. 9, the Labor Department said. Current levels remain well above the pre-pandemic peak of 695,000 and are higher than in any previous recession for records tracing back to 1967.<br />The Labor Department lowered its estimate for claims in the prior week to 812,000 from 847,000.<br />“I think this winter is going to be particularly tough on the job market,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The path of the economy is tied to the hip of the pandemic.”"
