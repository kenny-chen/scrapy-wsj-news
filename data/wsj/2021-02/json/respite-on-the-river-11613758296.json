    "body": "<br />It is always a pleasurable challenge to re-examine a familiar great work of art, in this case “Max Schmitt in a Single Scull” (1871) by Thomas Eakins, in the Metropolitan Museum’s American Wing. Also known as “The Champion Single Sculls,” it is the artist’s first major work.<br />Eakins was born in Philadelphia in 1844. His father, Benjamin, was an accomplished calligrapher of official documents and acquainted the youth with the pleasures and practices of drawing. Thomas showed exceptional talent, and was enrolled in 1857 at Central High School, which had a substantial curriculum in art and science.<br />There he expanded his technical skills and had his first exposure to perspective drawing. Following this, he entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1862, and took life classes drawing the nude model. All of these pursuits were critical factors in the shaping of his future career.<br />But what may have had the greatest impact on Eakins’s future were the lectures on human anatomy at Jefferson Medical College, which he attended in 1864, just as he was finishing work at the Pennsylvania Academy. He bypassed the Civil War, and at his father’s urging left for further study in Europe in 1866."
