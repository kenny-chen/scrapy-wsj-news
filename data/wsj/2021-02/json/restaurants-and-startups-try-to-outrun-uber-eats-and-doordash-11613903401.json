    "body": "<br />Apps like  DoorDash  and Uber Eats have provided restaurants a flood of customers in the pandemic. Now a host of food-ordering tools, along with some restaurants, are finding ways around those apps and the commissions they charge.<br />DoorDash Inc.,  Uber Technologies Inc.’s  Eats and  Grubhub Inc.  can charge restaurants up to 30% of every order—a chunk many owners say dents profits even as more orders come in.<br />A new crop of services is promising online ordering at a lower cost to eateries, by letting the restaurants arrange more deliveries themselves.<br />Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.,   Shake Shack Inc .  and a growing number of chains have acknowledged the cost of app-based delivery orders, and many say they intend to address it. Local governments from New York to Seattle have enforced rules capping delivery-app fees, in an effort to rein in restaurants’ costs while the health crisis keeps people home."
