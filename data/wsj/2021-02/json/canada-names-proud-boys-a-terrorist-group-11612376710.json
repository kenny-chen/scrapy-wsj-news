    "body": "OTTAWA—Canada designated the far-right Proud Boys as a terrorist organization, weeks after the group’s involvement in the storming of the U.S. Capitol.<br />Government officials said Wednesday that the Proud Boys met the legal threshold under Canadian law to be classified as a terrorist entity, citing reasonable grounds to believe that the group knowingly participated in or helped execute a terrorist act. Officials added Canada is believed to be the first jurisdiction to list the Proud Boys as a terrorist group.<br />“There is a growing body of evidence, collected here in Canada but also [by the U.S.], of an escalation of violence that the Proud Boys has been involved in,” said Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.<br />“This is not about politics,” he added, “and it is not about infringing upon the freedom of belief, association or speech. It is about controlling violent activities of ideologically-motivated extremism.”<br />Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, said the decision was unjustified and demonstrated heavy-handedness from Canada’s Liberal government."
