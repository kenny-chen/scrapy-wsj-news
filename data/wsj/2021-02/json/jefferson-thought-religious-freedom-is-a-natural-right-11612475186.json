    "body": "In her otherwise persuasive “Joe Biden’s Choice on Religious Freedom” (Houses of Worship, Jan. 29) commending President Trump’s record on religious freedom, Mary Vought stumbles in characterizing Thomas Jefferson’s views on that subject. She cites his 1800 letter to Benjamin Rush as evidence of Jefferson’s commitment to “the freedom of religion established in the First Amendment.” Jefferson was indeed passionate about religious freedom, as his letter to Rush shows, but he never thought the First Amendment “established” that freedom. Like his friend James Madison, who wrote the First Amendment, Jefferson understood religious freedom as among those natural rights that governments are formed to secure, not to establish. The founders believed that the right itself pre-existed the Constitution and, as an unalienable endowment of the creator, pre-existed government itself.<br />David Collins<br />Chicago"
