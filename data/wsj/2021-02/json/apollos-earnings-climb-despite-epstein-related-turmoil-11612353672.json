    "body": "Apollo Global Management Inc.  reported higher fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday as the private-equity giant’s business weathered a storm kicked up by Chief Executive Leon Black’s ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.<br />The New York firm posted net income of $434.1 million, or $1.80 a share, up from earnings of $166 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. Driving that was a 14% increase in fee-related earnings. Apollo’s private-equity portfolio also appreciated 13% during the quarter compared with an 11.7% increase for the S&P 500.<br />But the firm’s financial performance may once again be overshadowed by Mr. Black’s relationship with Epstein, who was indicted in 2019 on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls and later died by suicide in jail.<br />A recently concluded review by Dechert LLP backed up Mr. Black’s assertion that fees he paid Epstein, which the law firm said totaled $158 million, were for legitimate tax- and estate-planning advice. It found no evidence he was involved in Epstein’s criminal activities.<br />The question for Apollo’s shareholders is whether Mr. Black’s decision to cede the CEO role to co-founder Marc Rowan, announced with the findings of the review last week, will be enough to put to rest concerns of public pension funds and other institutions that commit money to the firm’s funds. Some had said they would hold off on new investments with the firm until they learned the findings of the review."
