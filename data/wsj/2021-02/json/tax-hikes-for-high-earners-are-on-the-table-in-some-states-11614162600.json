    "body": "State officials across the U.S. have grappled for months with the budgetary effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, some governors are proposing tax increases.<br />Prominent proposals include calls to raise billions of dollars across several states through taxes on the income and capital gains of higher earners.<br />Unlike the federal government, states generally can’t borrow to plug budget holes. After accounting for existing federal aid, states might need to come up with about $56 billion in spending cuts or revenue increases to balance their budgets through the fiscal year that ends in most states in June 2022, according to an estimate from Moody’s Analytics.<br />Budgetary pressures vary greatly among states, despite calls for more federal aid in general and tax hikes in some locales. In New York, state revenue collected from April through December 2020 was 4.1% lower than in the year-earlier period, according to data from the Urban Institute think tank.<br />In New Jersey, the drop was 2.4%. With tax revenue outperforming earlier projections, Gov. Phil Murphy on Tuesday proposed making a full payment to the state’s pension system for the first time since 1996. California has done even better, with revenue collections growing 1.2%, boosted by strong earnings for high-income taxpayers and a rallying stock market."
