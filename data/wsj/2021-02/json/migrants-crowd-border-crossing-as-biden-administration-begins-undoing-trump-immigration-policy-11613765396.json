    "body": "TIJUANA, Mexico—Hundreds of migrants crowded the pedestrian border crossing with the U.S. here Friday morning as the Biden administration let in the first handful who had been forced to wait in Mexico for their asylum claims to be resolved under Trump administration policy.<br />Biden administration officials had stressed in English and Spanish communications that only people contacted ahead of time would be allowed in Friday while others needed to register online and wait. A San Diego aid group set to receive the migrants said they were told by the government only 25 would be let in Friday.<br />The admissions are part of President Biden’s reversal of the Trump policy officially called Migrant Protection Protocols but generally known as Remain in Mexico. It required migrants seeking asylum, many of them families, to wait in Mexican border cities for their claims to be resolved, rather than in the U.S. as had previously been the case.<br />The waits have been prolonged by the Covid-19 pandemic that closed immigration courts handling their claims.<br />The administration announced last week that, beginning Friday, it would start allowing some migrants in the program to enter the U.S. The government said it is moving slowly because allowing in large numbers of people could pose a public-health risk."
