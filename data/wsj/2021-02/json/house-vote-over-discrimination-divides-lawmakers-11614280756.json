    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House voted 224 to 206 Thursday on legislation to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, an expansive effort that has spurred fierce opposition among conservatives over religious freedom and set off a new round of partisan fighting in Congress.<br />The measure, known as the Equality Act, marks a major plank of what Democrats term their equality agenda, following earlier laws treating attacks against gay people as hate crimes and allowing gay people to serve openly in the military. The Equality Act would amend the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination based on race, religion, sex and other characteristics, to include sexual orientation and gender identity.<br />“It is needed because there is discrimination against people in the LGBTQ community,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said on Thursday. “It breaks my heart that it is necessary,” she said, choking up a press conference.<br />The White House supports the legislation but its fate in the Senate is uncertain. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on Thursday declined to say when he would schedule the measure for a vote.<br />In a press conference with the Capitol as a backdrop and later on the House floor, Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus denounced the legislation, saying that it would discriminate against certain adoption agencies that don’t allow adoptions by same-sex parents, undermine women’s sports, and block healthcare providers from declining to perform abortions on the basis of their religious beliefs."
