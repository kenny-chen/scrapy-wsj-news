    "body": "FanDuel Group Chief Executive Matt King watched sports evaporate in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, sapping away the events that the sports-betting world relied upon.<br />But major sports have returned, culminating with this weekend’s Super Bowl, one of the biggest sports events in the world and a branding opportunity for sportsbooks competing for market share. The American Gaming Association predicts more than 23 million people in the U.S. will bet $4.3 billion on Super Bowl LV, with a record number of people doing so online.<br />FanDuel kept hiring despite the pandemic—as more states legalized sports betting and leagues returned to play—growing by about 40% to about 1,500 people. The company now operates mobile sports betting in 10 states.<br />Mr. King, 41 years old, has led FanDuel since 2017. He talked with The Wall Street Journal this week from his home in snowy Chicago. Here are edited excerpts from the interview:<br />WSJ: What is FanDuel expecting for betting this weekend?"
