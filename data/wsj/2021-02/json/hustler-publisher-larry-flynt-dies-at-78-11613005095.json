    "body": "LOS ANGELES—Porn purveyor Larry Flynt, who built Hustler magazine into an adult-entertainment empire while championing First Amendment rights, died Wednesday. He was 78.<br />Mr. Flynt had been in frail health and died of heart failure at his Hollywood Hills home, said his nephew Jimmy Flynt Jr.<br />From his beginnings as an Ohio strip club owner to his reign as founder of one of the most explicit adult-oriented magazines, Mr. Flynt constantly challenged the establishment and became a target for the religious right and feminist groups.<br />Mr. Flynt scored a surprising U.S. Supreme Court victory over the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who had sued him for libel after a 1983 Hustler alcohol ad suggested Mr. Falwell had lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse.<br />Mr. Flynt’s company produced not only Hustler but other niche publications. He owned a video production company, various websites, a Los Angeles-area casino, and 10 Hustler boutiques. He also licensed the Hustler name to independently owned strip clubs."
