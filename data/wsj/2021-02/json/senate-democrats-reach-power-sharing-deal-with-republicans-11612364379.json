    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said leaders of both parties have finalized the organizing resolution for the new Democratic-controlled Senate and plan to pass it later Wednesday.<br />The resolution will give Democrats control of Senate committees after two weeks of talks. The Senate is split 50-50, but Democrats are the majority as Vice President Kamala Harris can break any ties.<br />In remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday morning, Mr. Schumer said Democrats are “ready to hit the ground running” on President Biden’s agenda.<br />“Senate Democrats are not going to waste any time taking on the biggest challenges facing our country and our planet,” Mr. Schumer said, adding that he’s already instructed the incoming Democratic chairs of relevant committees to begin holding hearings on major climate legislation.<br />“It’s long past time for the Senate to take a leading role in combating the existential threat of our time: climate,” Mr. Schumer said. “As we all know, climate change touches virtually every aspect of our economy and involves virtually every aspect of public policy. So as the Biden administration prepares a whole government approach to combating climate change, the Democratic majority will pursue a whole-of-Senate approach as well.”"
