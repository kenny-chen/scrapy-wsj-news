    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said he planned to fly back from Mexico later Thursday, after drawing widespread criticism for taking his family on vacation in Cancún as his state struggled with freezing temperatures and widespread power outages.<br />In a statement released Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cruz said he accompanied his daughters to Mexico for an impromptu trip and was flying back immediately. The statement didn’t say whether his plans were influenced by the blowback at home.<br />“With school canceled for the week, our girls asked to take a trip with friends. Wanting to be a good dad, I flew down with them last night and am flying back this afternoon,” he said. Mr. Cruz said he and his staff have been in regular communication with state and local leaders.<br />Mr. Cruz’s staff didn’t respond to a request for comment. The Senate is currently on recess and expected to reconvene next week.<br />Photos were posted on social media Wednesday night of Mr. Cruz and his family boarding a flight that appeared to be heading to Cancún. As more clues emerged, his office declined to respond to questions about the trip before putting out the statement. A spokeswoman for the Houston Police Department said that Mr. Cruz’s staff had contacted the police force to request assistance for his departure."
