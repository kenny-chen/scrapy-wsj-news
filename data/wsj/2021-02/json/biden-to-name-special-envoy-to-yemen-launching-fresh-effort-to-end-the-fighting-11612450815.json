    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden on Thursday said he would name a veteran diplomat as his special envoy for Yemen, in what U.S. officials described as a new effort to end a nearly six-year conflict that has turned the country into the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.<br />Mr. Biden said in a foreign-policy speech at the State Department that he was appointing Timothy Lenderking, a career diplomat with long experience in Gulf and Yemen affairs, to be his point person on the conflict. The president signaled during his campaign that he would take a different approach to Yemen and the Saudi-led military campaign there from that of the Trump administration.<br />Mr. Biden also said U.S. support for offensive operations in Yemen would end. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the cutoff of support is in line with Mr. Biden’s campaign pledge to prevent American weapons from being further used in the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.<br />Mr. Sullivan said the action includes Mr. Biden’s recent decision to halt U.S. arms sales of precision-guided munitions to Riyadh, but it won’t affect counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda in the region.<br />He added that the White House has consulted with senior officials in Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates about its decision."
