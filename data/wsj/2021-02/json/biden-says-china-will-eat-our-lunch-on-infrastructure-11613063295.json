    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden warned that China is making advancements in transportation that give it an advantage over the U.S., as he made a pitch for Congress to pass an economic recovery package that includes infrastructure improvements.<br />“If we don’t get moving, they’re going to eat our lunch. They have major, major new initiatives on rail,” Mr. Biden said, adding that China is also making rapid advances on electric-vehicle technology.<br />The president spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday night in a call that Mr. Biden said lasted two hours. The two leaders, speaking for the first time since Mr. Biden took office, discussed a range of issues, including human rights, trade and security, according to the White House.<br />In May 2019 remarks, Mr. Biden appeared to dismiss the notion that China posed a major competitive threat to the U.S.<br />“China is going to eat our lunch? C’mon man,” he said in Iowa, asserting that the country was facing internal problems on a scale much larger than those in the U.S. Mr. Biden added, “They’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They’re not competition for us.”"
