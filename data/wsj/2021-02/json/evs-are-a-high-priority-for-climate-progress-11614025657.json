    "body": "Holman Jenkins’s “EVs Are the Lowest Climate Priority” (Business World, Feb. 10) completely misses the mark. The transportation sector currently represents more than 28% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions per data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency—more than any other sector of the U.S. economy. Cars and light-duty trucks make up nearly 60% of those emissions, without any noticeable decrease in recent years. By way of contrast, carbon emissions from the U.S. power sector are at their lowest level in more than 30 years and continue to fall, as nearly 40% of our nation’s electricity comes from carbon-free sources.<br />Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time, and America’s investor-owned electric companies are well-positioned to continue to be part of the climate solution. This includes taking advantage of the great strides made from emissions reductions in the electric sector to help reduce transportation-sector emissions by increasing the number of nonemitting electric vehicles on U.S. roads. In other words, EVs are a top climate priority and an effective and proven lever to reduce emissions.<br />We look forward to leveraging our progress and to working with the Biden administration on policies that help drive electrification and reduce emissions from the transportation sector.<br />Tom Kuhn<br />President"
