    "body": "WASHINGTON—A reporter couldn’t even finish saying former President Donald Trump’s name before Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) interrupted mid-question.<br />“So, Donald—”<br />“We’re still doing that?” said Mr. Cornyn, cutting off a TV journalist asking about developments ahead of Mr. Trump’s Senate trial.<br />Nearly three weeks after President Biden stepped into the Oval Office, Republicans are still adjusting to life being shut out of power in the White House and both chambers of Congress for the first time since 2010. Republicans on Capitol Hill, where the Senate is beginning on Tuesday its second impeachment trial of Mr. Trump in two years, continue to hone what the GOP represents with Mr. Trump out of office but broadly popular among the party rank and file.<br />They have found functional upsides. Republicans are for the first time in four years living without fear of presidential tweets inviting primary election challenges, or having to comment on his often controversial pronouncements. “Members definitely don’t miss it,” said one GOP Senate aide. Some Republican lawmakers and strategists are privately hoping that Mr. Trump’s exile from Twitter might make it easier for the party to move on from him to focus on the policy issues at hand—and on countering Mr. Biden."
