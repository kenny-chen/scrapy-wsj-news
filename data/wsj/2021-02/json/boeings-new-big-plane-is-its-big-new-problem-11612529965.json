    "body": "<br /><br />Boeing Co. ’s newest jetliner is becoming its latest big problem, stretching out development, racking up a huge charge and complicating the plane maker’s bid to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />When Boeing decided to build the 777X in 2013, engineers designed it for airlines wanting to connect the globe’s major cities and carry some 400 passengers more efficiently than any of its earlier widely used jets. As the latest version of Boeing’s long-range jetliner introduced in the 1990s, it features two giant, fuel-efficient engines and big wings that fold so they can pull up to airport gates.<br />Boeing’s bet is souring, however. Unlike with some of its other airplanes, Boeing’s recent 777X woes aren’t directly related to apparent design missteps or quality lapses. The plane’s troubles stem from the pandemic’s hit to international travel and broader market fallout, and a stiffer regulatory posture following Boeing’s missteps tied to a hazardous flight control system that led to two fatal crashes of its smaller 737 MAX jets."
