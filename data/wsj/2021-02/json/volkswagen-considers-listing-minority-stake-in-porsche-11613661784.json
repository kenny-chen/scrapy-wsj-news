    "body": "BERLIN— Volkswagen AG  is considering listing as much as 25% of its sports car maker  Porsche AG , a move that analysts said could boost the market value of the entire  Volkswagen  group and raise cash needed for investment in electric vehicles and new technology.<br />The idea of listing Porsche or selling a stake in luxury car maker Audi isn’t new within Volkswagen’s top management, but people familiar with the company’s thinking said talks within Volkswagen have taken on greater urgency as the company pivots hard toward electric vehicles and sees its market value dwarfed by technology rivals such as  Tesla Inc .<br />The discussions are still at a very early stage, the people said, adding that if Volkswagen decided to move forward with the listing, it might not happen until next year, if at all.<br />Volkswagen shares rose almost 4% to €167.80, equivalent to about $203, in late afternoon trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange.<br />The company declined to comment about a potential listing of Porsche."
