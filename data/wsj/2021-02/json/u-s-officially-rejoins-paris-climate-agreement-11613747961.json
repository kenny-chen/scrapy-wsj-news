    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris climate change agreement on Friday as President Biden puts environmental policy at the center of his agenda and prepares to work with world leaders to cut global greenhouse gas emissions.<br />On his first day in office last month Mr. Biden took an initial step toward rejoining the global accord, which was a signature achievement of former President Barack Obama and from which former President Donald Trumpsubsequently withdrew.<br />Under the agreement’s rules, a country can formally re-enter the pact 30 days after it gives notice to the United Nations. Friday marks the end of that 30-day period.<br />“The work to reduce our emissions has already begun, and we will waste no time in engaging our partners around the world to build our global resilience,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote on Twitter.<br />Mr. Trump argued that the agreement’s terms weren’t fair to the U.S. because other major emitters weren’t doing enough to cut emissions under the pact. Though Mr. Trump repeatedly said during his presidency that the U.S. was no longer a party to the agreement, the withdrawal became effective in early November 2020, near the end of his term, because it took time to formally exit the pact."
