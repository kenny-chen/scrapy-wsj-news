    "body": "It will be a marquee event as long they continue to meet—Naomi Osaka versus Serena Williams, anywhere, anytime, for anything, the most electric women’s tennis player of the moment, versus perhaps the greatest to ever do it.<br />But for now, and maybe the remainder of its duration, the edge appears to be Osaka’s.<br />They played Thursday in Melbourne, in the semifinals of the Australian Open, where the 3rd-seeded Osaka, age 23, met the 10th-seeded Williams, 39, before a scattered, socially-distant crowd in the Southern Hemisphere.<br />Tennis fans hoped for a classic, or at least something that stayed close. It was neither. After some early Osaka wobbles and some brief exuberance for Williams—maybe this really is going to be her tournament—Osaka recovered to seize control. She ripped off five straight games to dominate the first set, and the second went mostly the same.<br />Williams, still seeking.a historic 24th major title, played very well during this Open, but had no answers."
