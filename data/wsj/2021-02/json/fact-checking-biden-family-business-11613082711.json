    "body": "Voters might have thought that suppression of news and commentary about Biden family influence peddling ended with the election. But it seems that  Facebook  and Politifact are still on the case, seeking to discredit allegations against the Bidens without even knowing whether they are true or false.<br />Politifact’s Tom Kertscher writes:<br />Facebook’s message atop the post says:<br />These “independent fact-checkers” presumably include the left-leaning PolitiFact, because Mr. Kertscher refers to “our partnership” with Facebook.<br />Even if Facebook and PolitiFact really do understand the context of Biden family business ventures well enough to make this call, many consumers don’t want them serving as moderators for online discussions."
