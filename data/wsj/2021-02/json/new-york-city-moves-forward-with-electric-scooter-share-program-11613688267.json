    "body": "New York City will run a pilot program to test electric-scooter share systems for at least a year in an 18-square-mile section of the East Bronx, transportation officials said Thursday.<br />”In a lot of ways it’s the perfect place to use scooters to improve transit equity,” said Paul Steely White, director of public affairs at Superpedestrian, a micro-mobility company that has applied to participate in the program scheduled to start in the spring.<br />Mr. White noted that the area, home to 570,000 people, is popular with many essential workers who struggle with some of the city’s longest commutes because of poor mass-transit connections.<br />City officials said they would evaluate how well scooters serve the area’s Black and Latino residents, who make up 80% of the population, as well as the area’s 25,000 New York City Housing Authority residents.<br />Electric-scooter companies often tout their vehicles’ ability to help people get to subway and bus lines that are more than a short walk away."
