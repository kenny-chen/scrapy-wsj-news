    "body": "Federal prosecutors in New Jersey said Wednesday they were dropping drunken-driving charges against musician Bruce Springsteen.<br />Following the announcement, Jeep said it would repost its commercial starring Mr. Springsteen that it had pulled from YouTube after his arrest on the charges came to light earlier this month.<br />Mr. Springsteen was arrested on Nov. 14 by federal law-enforcement rangers in Gateway National Recreation Area. He had faced charges of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol and for reckless driving, according to prosecutors. He was also charged with consuming alcohol in a closed area.<br />During a hearing Wednesday, prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey said they were dropping the two driving-related charges because tests showed Mr. Springsteen’s blood-alcohol level was under the legal limit. Federal Judge Anthony R. Mautone subsequently dismissed the two charges during the hearing.<br />During the hearing, Mr. Springsteen pleaded guilty to the third charge of consuming alcohol in a closed area. Judge Mautone imposed a $500 fine on Mr. Springsteen for the charge, citing the rock star’s mostly clean driving record and lack of previous criminal convictions."
