    "body": "WASHINGTON—With a moment of silence and a candlelit memorial, President Biden marked the loss of life from Covid-19, as the U.S. death toll passed 500,000 Monday.<br />“We often hear people described as ordinary Americans. There’s no such thing, there’s nothing ordinary about them,” Mr. Biden said during a speech at the White House. “People we lost were extraordinary. They spanned generations, born in America, emigrated to America. Just like that, so many of them took their final breath alone in America.”<br />“As a nation, we can’t accept such a cruel fate,” he said.<br />The president’s somber speech came after the number of U.S. deaths surpassed a half-million, with more than 1,200 fatalities reported on Sunday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly a year ago, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.<br />“We have been fighting this pandemic for so long. We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow. We have to resist viewing each life as a statistic,” Mr. Biden said, as he referenced the grief he felt after the deaths of his wife, daughter and son. “That black hole in your chest, you feel like you’re being sucked into it. The survivor’s remorse, the anger.”"
