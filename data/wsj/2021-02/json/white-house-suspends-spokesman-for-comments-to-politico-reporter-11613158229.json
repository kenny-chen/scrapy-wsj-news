    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House suspended a senior West Wing aide for one week without pay after he allegedly threatened a reporter who was pursuing a story about his relationship with another journalist.<br />In a statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the aide, deputy White House press secretary TJ Ducklo, “is the first to acknowledge this is not the standard of behavior set out by the President.” She said White House chief of staff Ron Klain approved Mr. Ducklo’s suspension.<br />Ms. Psaki described the January exchange between Mr. Ducklo and Politico reporter Tara Palmeri as “a heated conversation about his personal life.” But she offered no other details. The White House statement came hours after Vanity Fair published a story on the conversation between Mr. Ducklo and Ms. Palmeri regarding a story she was planning about Mr. Ducklo dating Axios reporter Alexi McCammond.<br />Ms. Psaki said Mr. Ducklo won’t work with Politico reporters when he returns from his suspension, adding that he apologized to Ms. Palmeri.<br />During a briefing with reporters on Friday afternoon, Ms. Psaki called Mr. Ducklo’s behavior “completely unacceptable.” She said White House officials had conversations with Politico about the incident and expressed their apologies."
