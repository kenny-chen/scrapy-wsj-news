    "body": "Uighurs have traveled to Turkey for decades in search of refuge from political and religious repression, but recent arrests and a proposed extradition treaty with China are making many fear the country is no longer a haven.<br />While arrests of Uighurs, mostly on allegations related to terrorism, have been occurring in Turkey for several years, they have escalated in recent months, lawyers say. The most recent were Jan. 18, when police in Istanbul detained three Uighurs in a counterterrorism raid.<br />“We are all panicking now,” said Melike, whose husband was among those detained. “We cannot sleep at night.”<br />Local police accused her husband, Abdullah Metseydi, of engaging in terrorism, said Melike, who asked to withhold her surname, which is different from her husband’s. One officer said her husband had conducted “activities against China,” she said, before he was taken to a deportation center, where he remains.<br />Turkey’s Interior Ministry, which oversees the national police force, didn’t reply to a request for comment."
