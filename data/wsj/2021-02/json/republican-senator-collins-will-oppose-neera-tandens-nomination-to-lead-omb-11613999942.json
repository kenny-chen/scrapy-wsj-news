    "body": "WASHINGTON—Republican Sen. Susan Collins said she would oppose Neera Tanden’s nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget, further narrowing her chances of getting confirmed by the Senate.<br />In a statement Monday, Ms. Collins, a moderate from Maine who was among a handful of Republicans who were seen as possibly supporting the nomination, cited Ms. Tanden’s past statements on social media in explaining her decision.<br />“Neera Tanden has neither the experience nor the temperament to lead this critical agency,” Ms. Collins said. “Her past actions have demonstrated exactly the kind of animosity that President Biden has pledged to transcend.”<br />On Friday, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said he would oppose Ms. Tanden, citing her past statements and tweets criticizing Republicans.<br />Democrats control a narrow majority in the 50-50 Senate because Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie. But Ms. Tanden’s nomination wouldn’t have enough support to move forward if Mr. Manchin joins all Republicans in voting against her. Many Republicans have expressed misgivings about her nomination."
