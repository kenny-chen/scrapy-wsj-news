    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden said that former President Donald Trump shouldn’t have access to intelligence briefings due to his “erratic behavior unrelated to the insurrection.”<br />Mr. Biden told CBS Evening News with Norah O’Donnell that he saw no reason for his predecessor to get briefings, saying: “What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?”<br />CBS released excerpts of the interview, which will air in full Sunday, on Friday evening.<br />Representatives for Mr. Trump didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this week that Mr. Biden’s national security team was looking into whether to extend intelligence briefings to Mr. Trump."
