    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden on Wednesday revoked most immigration restrictions that former President Donald Trump imposed last year in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The White House said it was revoking parts of a ban that blocked entry into the U.S. to family members of U.S. citizens, some immigrants with employment-based green cards and winners of the diversity visa lottery. Mr. Biden has left in place restrictions that block the entry of foreigners with several types of work-based visas including the H-1B visa for high-skilled foreign professionals. That aspect of the ban is set to expire on March 31.<br />The Trump administration, which imposed the ban on most forms of legal immigration in April and expanded it in June, said at the time it had been necessary to prevent foreigners from coming to the U.S. and taking jobs when unemployment had skyrocketed as a result of the pandemic. A Wall Street Journal review found the ban didn’t have the intended effect: Jobs allotted to foreigners, typically in high-skill roles as software engineers or seasonal positions such as working at a resort, went unfilled.<br />The ban “harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,’’ the White House said. “It also harms industries in the United States that utilize talent from around the world.’’<br />The revoked ban applied to applicants for U.S. permanent residency who are parents or siblings of U.S. citizens, along with applicants for several types of employment-based permanent residency cards, called green cards."
