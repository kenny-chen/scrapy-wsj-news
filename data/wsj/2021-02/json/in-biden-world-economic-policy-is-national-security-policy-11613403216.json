    "body": "You may not have heard of Daleep Singh, but he represents an important new way of thinking about America’s approach to the rest of the world.<br />Mr. Singh has been a top official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and is a former Treasury Department aide and an alumnus of private-sector investment firms. He has just gone to work for the new Biden administration. But he didn’t sign on for any traditional domestic economic job.<br />Instead, he now is deputy national security adviser.<br />That makes him the embodiment of a quiet but revolutionary way of thinking about America’s national security. Economic policy and foreign policy no longer are separate. Instead, the Biden administration, worried about American competitiveness around the globe, is making them one and the same.<br />This line of thinking about national security already was under way in the Trump administration, but President Biden and his aides are turbocharging it. It is one of the most important but underappreciated changes in Washington today."
