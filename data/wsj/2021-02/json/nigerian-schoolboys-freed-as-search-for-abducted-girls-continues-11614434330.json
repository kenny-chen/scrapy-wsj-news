    "body": "Gunmen in Nigeria released 42 people on Saturday, including 27 schoolboys, who were kidnapped from their boarding school last week in the north-central state of Niger, the state’s governor said.<br />The release comes a day after a separate mass kidnapping in Zamfara state, where another group of gunmen seized 317 schoolgirls, who remain missing.<br />The abductions have come amid a surge in kidnappings for ransom across northern Nigeria, where armed militancy has led to a worsening breakdown of security. Hundreds of schools across a vast swath of Africa’s most populous country have been closed in recent days, while surveillance aircraft and security forces have been dispatched to hunt for the missing.<br />The 42 hostages freed on Saturday were taken from a school in the Kagara district of Niger state, which borders the capital Abuja, and marched into the sprawling Rugu forest on Feb. 17, when gunmen overwhelmed the school security, killing one student.<br />“The Abducted Students, Staff and Relatives of Government Science College Kagara have regained their freedom and have been received by the Niger State Government,” Abubakar Sani Bello, the governor of Niger state, said on  Twitter .  He gave no details about how the captives were freed."
