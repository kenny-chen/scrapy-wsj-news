    "body": "The U.S. Postal Service is finally retiring its aging mail trucks. It unveiled plans this week for a new delivery van with a host of improvements such as a bigger windshield, a collision-avoidance system and air conditioning.<br />About 10% of them will have battery-driven electric powertrains. The rest will use gas engines because the cost of buying an all-electric fleet would have added billions of dollars in costs to the multibillion-dollar project, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told a Congressional hearing on Wednesday.<br />The Postal Service awarded a contract to  Oshkosh Corp.  worth an initial $482 million to complete the design of the so-called Next Generation Delivery Vehicle. It will be a right-hand-drive van with more cargo room for packages from e-commerce services.<br />Mr. DeJoy said Wednesday that each of the gas-powered vehicles will have the capability to be converted to electric motors in the future.<br />The Postal Service plans to buy up to 165,000 of the U.S.-produced vehicles over a decade. The first ones are expected to arrive in 2023. The service has been soliciting proposals to replace its current delivery vans since 2015. Shares of  Workhorse Group Inc.,  a rival bidder, tumbled this week after it missed out on the project."
