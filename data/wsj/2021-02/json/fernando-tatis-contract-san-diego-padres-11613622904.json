    "body": "Just a few weeks ago, Fernando Tatís Jr. didn’t want to talk much about his future. Asked about the possibility of signing a long-term extension with the San Diego Padres, he deflected.<br />“I’m not going to say much, but I’d love to stay in San Diego,” Tatís said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. “Hopefully we can work it out.”<br />Suffice it to say they did just that—and it will result in Tatís signing the longest contract in baseball history.<br />Tatís, the 22-year-old shortstop widely viewed as baseball’s brightest young star, agreed to a 14-year deal with the Padres worth $340 million Wednesday night, possibly tying himself to San Diego for most or all of his career. In terms of total dollars, Tatís’s deal ranks third all-time, trailing only Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts (12 years, $365 million) and Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout (10 years, $360 million).<br />In one crucial way, Tatís’s contract stands alone. Betts inked his pact at the age of 27, with six strong seasons for the Boston Red Sox and a MVP award on his résumé. Trout had already established himself as the undisputed best player on the planet when he signed his deal to remain in Anaheim the rest of his professional life."
