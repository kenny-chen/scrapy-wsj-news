    "body": "SYDNEY—China has charged an Australian journalist with sharing state secrets overseas after she was detained about six months ago, stoking concerns about intimidation of foreign media and deepening a diplomatic dispute that has chilled bilateral trade.<br />Cheng Lei, an anchor for the Chinese government’s English-language television news channel, was officially charged on Friday, having earlier been detained by local authorities on Aug. 13. Ms. Cheng’s detention and the evacuation of two other Australian reporters from China weeks later illustrated the dangers that journalists can face while working in the country.<br />Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it has repeatedly raised concerns about her situation with senior Chinese officials. China hasn’t detailed the charges Ms. Cheng faces, including what state secrets it alleges have been disclosed or to which country.<br />Ms. Cheng was educated at Australia’s University of Queensland and has worked for CGTN since 2012, according to her LinkedIn profile at the time of her detention. Australian embassy officials have visited Ms. Cheng six times since she was detained, most recently on Jan. 27.<br />A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry wasn’t immediately available to comment."
