    "body": "Lawyers for former President Donald Trump argued it is unconstitutional to impeach a former president and declared the coming Senate trial “political theater” in a pretrial brief Monday that offered the fullest picture of their defense.<br />Senate leaders are aiming to start the trial with a brief debate and vote on the constitutionality of the proceedings Tuesday, followed by several days of presentations that could include witnesses, according to a person familiar with the talks.<br />“This rushed, single article of impeachment ignores the very Constitution from which its power comes and is itself defectively drafted,” Mr. Trump’s lawyers wrote in a 78-page brief viewed by The Wall Street Journal. “This was only ever a selfish attempt by Democratic leadership in the House to prey upon the feelings of horror and confusion that fell upon all Americans across the entire political spectrum upon seeing the destruction at the Capitol on January 6 by a few hundred people.”<br />The defense team said the rioters who breached the Capitol “did so of their own accord and for their own reasons.”<br />The lawyers called for the Senate to dismiss the case. It is not known if they will formally make a motion for dismissal once the trial opens, or whether the rules of the trial would permit that. Any motion to dismiss is all-but-certain to fail as Democrats control the 50-50 Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as the tiebreaking vote."
