    "body": "On her way to becoming the greatest gymnast of all time, Simone Biles began each year by writing out her goals: short-term, medium-term and long-term. Her training to meet them drew heavily on the competition calendar, which gave her very specific deadlines and clear windows when she could take a break.<br />As she prepares to step into the Ariake Gymnastics Centre in Tokyo at the Olympic Games this summer, Biles is contending with something totally unfamiliar. The most-decorated female gymnast in world championship history has not competed since October 2019.<br />Coronavirus has not just delayed the arrival of a second Olympics that Biles expects to be her last. It’s also wiped from the buildup any certainty around the smaller events that have normally served as important stepping stones.<br />It’s possible that Biles this year will go from a few domestic meets straight to the biggest stage of the sport, giving an international debut of a record-shattering vault and a fresh floor routine at the place least conducive to trying something different.<br />“You don’t really want to go to the Olympic Games and perform a brand new skill for the first time,” said Biles’s coach, Cecile Landi, who is still hoping that an international event will take place before the Games that can serve as a dress rehearsal for Biles."
