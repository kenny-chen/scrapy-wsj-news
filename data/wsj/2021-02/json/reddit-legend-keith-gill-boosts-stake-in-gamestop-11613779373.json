    "body": "DeepF---ingValue has doubled down on  GameStop Corp.<br />The trader, who became a legend on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum for his prescient bet on the videogame retailer, posted a screenshot of his brokerage account on Friday afternoon that appears to show he bought an additional 50,000 shares of the stock. The Reddit user, whose real name is Keith Gill, now holds 100,000 shares of GameStop worth about $4 million, the screenshot shows.<br />The post doesn’t indicate when the shares were purchased. A previous update, posted the afternoon of Feb. 3, put his position at 50,000 shares. Mr. Gill declined to comment.<br />Much of the momentum surrounding GameStop has fizzled in recent weeks. Shares fell 23% this week to $40.59 and have dropped more than 90% since peaking on an intraday basis at $483 on Jan. 28. They closed Feb. 3 at $92.41.<br />Mr. Gill appeared at a congressional hearing about the GameStop frenzy on Thursday where he was asked by a lawmaker if he thought the stock was still appealing. “I do find that it’s an attractive investment at this price point,” he responded."
