    "body": "WASHINGTON—The federal government is preparing to offer needy households a discount of up to $50 a month on broadband service during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The Federal Communications Commission said Thursday that it would set up a program within 60 days, after its four members unanimously voted to approve it. Congress set aside $3.2 billion for the initiative in a pandemic relief law passed late last year.<br />FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said the program is the largest ever to help U.S. households afford broadband service. “It’s a challenge that is all too real for too many families,” she said.<br />Details about the program, such as how and where to apply, aren’t available.<br />The Emergency Broadband Benefit is open to households that meet one of a number of criteria, including having lost jobs or seen income reduced in the past year. It would also be available to people who participate in aid programs such as reduced-price school meals, student Pell grants, Lifeline subsidies for telecom service and low-income or emergency pandemic programs from private broadband providers.  It offers up to a $50-a-month discount on broadband service, rising to $75 a month for households on tribal lands. Discounts of $100 on a computer or tablet may also be available."
