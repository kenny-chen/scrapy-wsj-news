    "body": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  sold $5 billion of bonds, showing investors remain eager to back the Chinese e-commerce giant despite its recent run-ins with authorities.<br />The company issued four sets of bonds priced to yield between 2.143% and 3.251%, Alibaba said in a filing. Alibaba sold $1.5 billion each of 10-year and 30-year debt, plus $1 billion each of bonds due in 20 and 40 years.<br />The 20-year bonds were designated as sustainability notes, meaning the proceeds will be used to fund projects such as building greener offices or installing more energy-efficient data centers.<br />Alibaba shares have swung sharply in recent months, after a speech in October by founder Jack Ma prompted Chinese President Xi Jinping to call off the blockbuster listing of Ant Group Co., the company’s financial-technology affiliate. Mr. Ma has since largely vanished from public life, though he resurfaced briefly in a video appearance in January.<br />In December, Chinese authorities launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba. And in January, The Wall Street Journal reported U.S. officials considered adding Alibaba to an investment blacklist that blocks Americans from buying stocks and bonds of certain Chinese companies, though the company wasn’t ultimately added."
