    "body": "Editor’s note: This week’s Future View discusses the Biden administration’s move to allow transgender people to serve openly in the military and transgender high-school girls to compete on girls’ sports teams. For next week we’ll ask, “In light of the  GameStop  stock-market mania, is the mass coordination facilitated by social-media platforms a blessing or a curse?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Feb. 9.
