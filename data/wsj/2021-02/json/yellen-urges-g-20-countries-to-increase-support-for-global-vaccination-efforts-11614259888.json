    "body": "WASHINGTON—Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged the Group of 20 countries to increase their support for global vaccination programs, citing “the high, unmet needs of these initiatives.”<br />“A rapid and truly global vaccination program is the strongest stimulus we can provide to the global economy,” she said in a letter dated Feb. 25 to her colleagues in the G-20, which includes China and other emerging-market economies.<br />Ms. Yellen raised concerns about low-income countries in particular, which she said could experience further deaths and a needless delay of their economic recoveries without access to vaccines.<br />She also emphasized the need for a coordinated response to the global crisis and urged G-20 countries “to continue to take significant fiscal and financial-policy actions and avoid withdrawing support too early.”<br />Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com"
