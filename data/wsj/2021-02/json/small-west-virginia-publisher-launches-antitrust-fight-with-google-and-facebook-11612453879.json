    "body": "When Doug Reynolds bought the largest paper in West Virginia out of bankruptcy in 2018, he knew he would have to fight hard to save a business hammered by a dramatic shift of readers and advertising online.<br />That fight just got a lot bigger.<br />Last week, his company, HD Media LLC, filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and  Facebook Inc.,  claiming they are manipulating the digital-advertising market, making it difficult for his paper, the Charleston Gazette-Mail, and others to survive.<br />The lawsuit is the first of its kind filed by a news outlet, according to the News Media Alliance trade group. It follows years of complaints by industry executives that the so-called digital duopoly has siphoned away their ad revenue and taken ever more control over news organizations’ ability to reach their audience.<br />“These companies are more powerful than Standard Oil in its heyday, so no one wants to be the first to take them on,” Mr. Reynolds said in an interview, referring to the company founded by John D. Rockefeller that was one of the first monopolies broken up by the U.S. government. “We felt the political and legal climate have moved in our favor and are ready to go ahead.”"
