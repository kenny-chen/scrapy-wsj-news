    "body": "Home Depot ’s  Chief Executive Craig Menear boasted on Tuesday that “for many customers, the home has never been more important.” Investors are getting anxious about how long that will continue.<br />Both Home Depot and  Lowe’s  had strong holiday quarters ended late January, with sales up roughly 25% compared with a year earlier. Among the best selling items were lumber and outdoor living categories such as patio furniture and grills. For the year, Lowe’s and Home Depot saw their revenue expand by 24.2% and 19.9%, respectively.<br />But investors are focused on the future. Despite strong results, Lowe’s and Home Depot shares dropped after their respective earnings calls this week.<br />Lowe’s stuck to the guidance that it laid out in December, in which it said sales would be around $86 billion in 2021 under the most bullish scenario, a decline of 4% from 2020. Home Depot declined to give guidance.<br />So far, there are no signs of sales slowing down. January was the strongest month of growth last quarter for both companies, boosted by fresh stimulus payments to consumers. Home Depot said on its earnings call that it has seen continued strong demand in February."
