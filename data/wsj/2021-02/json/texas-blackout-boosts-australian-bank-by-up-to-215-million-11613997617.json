    "body": "The deep freeze that plunged millions of Texans into darkness last week produced a windfall of up to $215 million for  Macquarie Group Ltd. , an Australian investment bank that is active in U.S. power and gas markets.<br />The extreme weather froze wind turbines and oil-and-gas wells, closed oil refiners and prompted power stations to trip offline, sending a jolt through energy markets. Wholesale power prices rocketed, as did spot prices for natural gas in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas.<br />The turbulence led to a bonanza for Macquarie’s commodity traders, who specialize in sending gas and electricity to clients such as utility companies in unusual situations.<br />The bank bumped up its guidance Monday for earnings in the year through March to reflect the windfall. It said that net profit after tax would be 5% to 10% higher than in the 2020 fiscal year. That equates to an increase of up to 273.1 million Australian dollars, equivalent to around $215 million. In its previous guidance, issued Feb. 9, Macquarie said it expected profits to be slightly down on 2020.<br />“Extreme winter weather conditions in North America have significantly increased short-term client demand for Macquarie’s capabilities in maintaining critical physical supply across the commodity complex, and particularly in relation to gas and power,” the bank said."
