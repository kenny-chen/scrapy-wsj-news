    "body": "New York Attorney General Letitia James said Tuesday a grand jury didn’t indict any police officer involved in the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who died in March after Rochester Police Department officers restrained him and placed a mesh hood over his head.<br />“The criminal-justice system has frustrated efforts to hold police officers accountable for the unjustified killings of unarmed African-Americans,” Ms. James said at a press conference Tuesday. “History has unfortunately repeated itself in the case of Daniel Prude.”<br />The circumstances surrounding Mr. Prude’s death first became public in September after his family held a news conference and released officers’ body-camera footage. Ms. James launched the investigation into Mr. Prude’s death thereafter.<br />On March 23, Rochester Police Department officers took Mr. Prude, who had a history of mental illness, into custody after responding to reports of a person acting erratically. Mr. Prude died in a hospital seven days later.<br />The Monroe County Office of the Medical Examiner ruled Mr. Prude’s death a homicide. The autopsy report concluded he died of asphyxiation “in the setting of physical restraint” and acute intoxication with the hallucinogenic drug PCP."
