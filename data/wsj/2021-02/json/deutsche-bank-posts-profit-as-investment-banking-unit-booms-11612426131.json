    "body": "As the coronavirus pandemic took hold in early 2020,  Deutsche Bank AG , long-plagued by problems, braced for another tough year. On Thursday, it reported a bumper annual profit.<br />Driving the bank’s results was booming activity from clients as they adjusted their needs and investment portfolios. The German lender’s investment banking results offset more challenging conditions for its bread-and-butter lending business, which has been hit by negative interest rates.<br />Some analysts, however, have questioned the sustainability of the results. Deutsche Bank shares were down over 1% midmorning.<br />Lower costs and lower-than-expected losses from bad loans drove it to a €624 million profit for the year, equivalent to $749 million, swinging from a €5.27 billion loss in 2019. It is the most significant profit the bank has made in six years, which were mostly marked by big losses.<br />“We have built firm foundations for sustainable profitability, and are confident that this overall positive trend will continue in 2021, despite these challenging times,” Chief Executive Christian Sewing said."
