    "body": "The relationship between New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and leading lawmakers of his own party has hit a nadir amid questions over the Democratic governor’s handling of Covid-19 in nursing homes.<br />Democrats who control the state Senate plan to pass a bill this week requiring additional approval of any future executive orders, which Mr. Cuomo has been issuing to manage the pandemic, according to a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat from Yonkers. Republican lawmakers are talking about impeachment, but Democrats dismissed their effort as disingenuous.<br />On Thursday, lawmakers from both parties said they would publicly grill State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker over the state’s delay in releasing a fuller tally of nursing-home deaths as well as a controversial March 25 department directive that said nursing homes couldn’t refuse to admit Covid-positive patients.<br />Mr. Cuomo and his aides have responded forcefully to critical lawmakers both recently and over the course of his time in office, and the governor said on Friday that he would be more aggressive in addressing critics of his actions on nursing homes. Dr. Zucker said the March 25 directive was consistent with federal guidance at the time and was necessary to preserve hospital capacity.<br />But pressure tactics that normally happen in private are bursting into public view and, some legislators said, have only steeled their positions."
