    "body": "Your editorial “Joe Biden’s Old Russia Start” (Feb. 2) notes that President Biden criticized Vladimir Putin for arresting Russian dissident Alexei Navalny but then offered Russia a “gift” by extending the expiring New Start nuclear arms treaty. Dissidents should never be linked to diplomacy over something as existential as nuclear war. If U.S. Presidents Nixon and Reagan had refused to negotiate nuclear-arms reductions with Russian leaders because of the way Moscow mistreated its dissidents, America’s most enduring nuclear treaties with Russia would never have helped both sides avoid nuclear war.<br />Mr. Biden’s decision to accept the longest possible extension (five years) of the New Start treaty without negotiating new conditions troubles you. Yet one of your complaints against the Iran nuclear accord in 2015 was that its limits on Tehran had expiration dates.<br />You argue that Russia violates arms accords. Yet we Americans pulled out of the 1972 missile-defense treaty and the 1987 intermediate-range missile treaty with Moscow. Treaties cannot be made with enemies willing to cheat, according to you. A favorite motto quoted on “The Sopranos” was: “Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.” In the age of “trust but verify,” nuclear treaties afford both sides that opportunity.<br />Frank Richter<br />Clawson, Mich."
