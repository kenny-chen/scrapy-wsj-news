    "body": "President Biden has stocked his China team with high-powered officials who have longstanding ties to one another but differing objectives. How they work together could determine whether the new administration has a unified China policy, or one riven with divisions that Beijing can exploit.<br />Former Secretary of State John Kerry, now the White House’s climate envoy, is pursuing an international climate deal that requires the cooperation of China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, to be effective. The White House’s China coordinator, Kurt Campbell, meanwhile wants to push back hard on China.<br />Both men sit on the National Security Council, led by Jake Sullivan, who worked with them during the Obama administration. Former Obama national-security adviser Susan Rice, now a Biden domestic policy adviser, may also weigh in on some China issues, say some of her former colleagues.<br />Mr. Sullivan now needs to weave together their views along with those of the heads of the Treasury, State Department, Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative’s office, which often have diverging perspectives.<br />During her confirmation hearing last week, Commerce Secretary-designate Gina Raimondo wouldn’t commit to continuing the Trump administration’s blacklisting of Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei Technologies Co., although Messrs. Campbell and Sullivan had previously identified the firm as a security risk."
