    "body": "Lyft Inc.<br />Lyft took another turn toward profitability. The ride-hailing company posted a narrower annual loss on Tuesday, even as the pandemic decimated demand in the industry. Lyft President John Zimmer aims to become profitable on an adjusted basis by the end of this year. Rival Uber Technologies Inc. also reported a smaller annual loss, on the back of its food-delivery business and aggressive cost cuts. Lyft shares gained 4.8% Wednesday.<br />Oracle Corp.<br />TikTok’s U.S. fate is in limbo again. The Biden administration shelved a plan to force a sale of the popular video-sharing app’s American operations to a group including Oracle and  Walmart Inc.  The deal was driven by former President Donald Trump, who last year ordered a ban on TikTok aimed at forcing a sale of the app to a majority-U.S.-ownership group. The TikTok deal has languished since last fall in the midst of successful legal challenges to the U.S. government’s effort by the app’s owner, Chinese tech company ByteDance Ltd. Oracle shares slipped 0.6% Wednesday.<br />Bumble Inc."
