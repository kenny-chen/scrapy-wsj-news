    "body": "RAWLINS, Wyo.—The Wyoming Republican Party voted overwhelmingly to censure Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) for voting to impeach President Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.<br />Only eight of the 74-member state GOP’s central committee stood to oppose censure on Saturday in a vote that didn’t proceed to a formal count. The censure document accused Ms. Cheney of voting to impeach even though the House didn’t offer Mr. Trump “formal hearing or due process.”<br />“We need to honor President Trump. All President Trump did was call for a peaceful assembly and protest for a fair and audited election,” said Darin Smith, a Cheyenne attorney who lost to Cheney in a Republican House primary in 2016. “The Republican Party needs to put her on notice.”<br />Ms. Cheney said in a statement after the vote that she remained honored to represent Wyoming and will always fight for the issues that matter most to the state.<br />“Foremost among these is the defense of our Constitution and the freedoms it guarantees. My vote to impeach was compelled by the oath I swore to the Constitution,” she added."
