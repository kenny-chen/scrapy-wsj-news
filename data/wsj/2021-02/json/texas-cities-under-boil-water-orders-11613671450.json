    "body": "More than 14 million people in Texas are without safe drinking water, as the fallout of a severe winter storm exacts a historic toll.<br />Cities including Austin, Houston and San Antonio are under boil-water notices until Monday. Some residents are bringing in shovelfuls of snow to flush their toilets.<br />The harsh weather has crippled Texas’s energy grid, leaving more than four millions residents without electricity during the peak of the blackouts, many of them remaining without heat in subfreezing conditions for days on end. The cold snap has also caused a wave of burst water pipes, which led to a loss of water pressure and a shortage.<br />Three dozen people have died due to weather-related issues across the U.S., according to the Associated Press. Traffic accidents make up the majority of those deaths, and half a dozen people have died from exposure.<br />Huge swaths of residents without clean water don’t have the electricity needed to boil it amid the continuing outages. Many others have pipes that are dry."
