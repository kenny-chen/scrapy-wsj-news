    "body": "WASHINGTON—The definition of criminal incitement has come to play a pivotal role in the Senate trial of former President Donald Trump, even though no criminal offense is necessary for a conviction under impeachment proceedings.<br />Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said Thursday that in making their case that Mr. Trump incited the Jan. 6 insurrection by his supporters at the Capitol, House managers have all but ignored “whether and how the conduct of President Trump met the legal standard of incitement.” Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) concurred, saying, “I was really disappointed they didn’t engage much with the legal standards.”<br />Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who leads the House impeachment managers, argued before the Senate that Mr. Trump’s actions amounted to the “high crimes and misdemeanors” the Constitution sets forth as grounds for impeachment—and also could be prosecuted under the stricter standards of criminal law.<br />Mr. Trump’s defense lawyers say nothing Mr. Trump has done amounts to incitement under any legal measure.<br />The criminal standards for incitement were defined by a 1969 Supreme Court decision, Brandenburg v. Ohio, which found that the First Amendment protects even speech that advocates violence or breaking the law unless it is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”"
