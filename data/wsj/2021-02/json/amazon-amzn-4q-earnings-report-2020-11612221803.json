    "body": "Amazon . com Inc. is poised to cap off its pandemic-fueled 2020 financial performance with record quarterly sales driven by a surge in online holiday shopping with people stuck at home.<br />Wall Street expects the online retailing giant to post more than $100 billion in quarterly sales for the first time after the bell Tuesday, days after Apple Inc. hit that financial milestone.<br />Analysts surveyed by FactSet on average see Amazon reporting $119.7 billion in quarterly revenue, with the company generating an expected $3.7 billion in net income. Amazon in October forecast fourth-quarter sales to be between $112 billion and $121 billion.<br />Few companies have seen growth take off like Amazon during the global health crisis. The explosion in online shopping vaulted the company’s sales to record figures as the e-commerce sector grew by around 50% throughout last year, according to some analysts. Roughly 40% of online shopping in the U.S. happens at Amazon, according to research firm eMarketer, helping drive a 76% increase in the company’s share price last year and raising its market valuation to more than $1.6 trillion.<br />Sales in the December quarter received an added boost from Amazon’s annual “Prime Day” shopping event moved from its usual summer schedule to October due to the pandemic. Amazon makes billions from the two-day event."
