    "body": "LONDON— Royal Dutch Shell  PLC reported a fourth-quarter loss as it continued to grapple with the fallout of the pandemic but said it would raise its dividend, forecasting a recovery in demand later this year.<br />International oil companies are reporting one of their worst annual performances in decades after Covid-19 sapped demand for oil, hitting prices. In response, energy companies have slashed spending, cut jobs and written down the value of their assets.<br />Shell on Thursday reported a fourth-quarter loss on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis—a figure similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report—of $4.5 billion, down from a profit of $871 million in the same period the previous year.<br />For the full year Shell reported a loss of $19.9 billion, from a profit of $15.3 billion in 2019. Shell’s peers including  Exxon Mobil Corp. ,  Chevron Corp.  and  BP  PLC also reported losses for 2020.<br />Shell said its profit was hit by a fall in oil and gas production and weak refining margins, as well as already flagged asset write-downs and charges related to onerous contracts."
