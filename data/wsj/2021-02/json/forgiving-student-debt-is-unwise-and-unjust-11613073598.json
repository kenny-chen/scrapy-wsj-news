    "body": "While Sen. Chuck Schumer urges debt forgiveness for students who borrowed their way through college, he ignores how this decision will inflict the burden of those same loans on others across the country (“White House Weighs Student-Debt Forgiveness,” U.S. News, Feb. 5). Many opted for other less costly educational opportunities, chose to go to work over attending college, worked while attending college, saved before attending college or chose degrees capable of providing income sufficient to repay their loans. Many brave men and women joined our armed forces and risked their lives to be provided an avenue to attend college when they completed their military service. By increasing the tax burden necessary to pay for debt cancellation, entitled individuals would prevent a whole other segment of our society from “buying cars, from going on vacation, from starting families.”<br />Maybe the colleges with the multimillion-dollar endowment funds that are benefiting from these overpriced educations should be on the hook for the forgiveness of the debt and not the U.S. taxpayer.<br />Patrick Demetruk<br />Stephenville, Texas<br />"
