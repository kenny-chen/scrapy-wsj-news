    "body": "Propane prices have climbed more than 70% since late November, thanks to an explosion in patio heating and an uptick in exports to Asia.<br />Now, an arctic gust expected to deliver some of the coldest temperatures in decades to the Great Plains and upper Midwest could push prices for the rural heating fuel even higher.<br />Futures prices at propane-trading hubs in Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Conway, Kan., have risen to 86 cents a gallon and 95 cents, respectively, up from about 50 cents in late November. Spot prices at both hubs have been similar to those of futures.<br />Prices for propane, a byproduct of natural-gas drilling and crude-oil refining, are up more than fourfold from the bottom in March, when lockdowns sent energy prices crashing and the market hadnâ€™t yet contemplated cold-weather outdoor dining.<br />Without much winter weather until lately, the propane market has been buoyed by overseas buyers as well as sales to stuck-at-home Americans and restaurants trying to extend patio season with portable heaters. Residential prices are up about 20% since late November, averaging $2.21 a gallon last week, according to the Energy Information Administration."
