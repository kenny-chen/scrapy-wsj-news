    "body": "From 2015 to 2017, as the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co. collected stakes in overseas hotels, financial institutions and office towers in a $40 billion deal-making frenzy, a question lingered: How did the company get so much money to spend?<br />Now, following the downfall of one of China’s most acquisitive companies, the findings of a provincial government working group are shedding some light on the unorthodox ways that money was moved around within HNA, which has a sprawling web of more than 2,000 subsidiaries, affiliates and shell companies.<br />Three publicly listed companies controlled by HNA, including its flagship carrier  Hainan Airlines ,  said in late January that billions of dollars were misappropriated from their businesses and that their coffers were drained by HNA’s activities. The three firms said their assets were also used to guarantee debts of HNA and its related entities.<br />An HNA spokeswoman declined to comment.<br />The recent disclosures are just the tip of the iceberg. HNA creditors, which include state-owned financial firms, have asked a court in Hainan to reorganize the company and disentangle the many complex financing arrangements that once powered its aggressive global expansion. HNA, which was sunk by massive debt, said it would submit to the legal process."
