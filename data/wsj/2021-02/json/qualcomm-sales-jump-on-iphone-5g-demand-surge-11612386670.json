    "body": "Qualcomm Inc.  parlayed the global 5G rollout and Apple Inc.’s inclusion of its chips in the latest iPhone models into an earnings jump that failed to satisfy investors betting phone-chip sales would be even higher.<br />The mobile-phone chip maker on Wednesday said its quarterly sales rose 62% from the year-ago period to $8.24 billion. Net income for the first quarter of the company’s financial year more than doubled to $2.46 billion.<br />The company narrowly missed Wall Street’s sales expectations of $8.27 billion, but beat the bottom line protection of net income of $2.09 billion, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.<br />Sales of chips for phones came in slightly below investor expectations that had been supercharged by Apple’s strong earnings a week ago. Qualcomm’s stock fell more than 8% in after-hours trading.<br />Qualcomm’s results were healthy, but investors had been hoping for a home-run performance, said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research."
