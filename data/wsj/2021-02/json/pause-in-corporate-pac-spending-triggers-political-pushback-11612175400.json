    "body": "Lawmakers from both parties are pushing back against companies that have suspended campaign donations, saying the freeze is unfairly punishing everyone and could undermine corporate interests in Washington.<br />Democrats friendly with business have complained to companies, including  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google,  Citigroup Inc.  and  Lockheed Martin Corp. , that they are being penalized for actions taken by Republicans challenging the results of the Nov. 3 election, people familiar with the discussions said.<br />Democrats have also told companies that pausing donations from their political-action committees could weaken them politically, ultimately jeopardizing business priorities in Congress, some of the people said.<br />Separately, Republicans who voted with Democrats to uphold President Biden’s win have told companies that cutting off their funding could hurt their election prospects and hinder them if they are challenged in a GOP primary by those who supported former President Donald Trump’s unfounded claim that he won re-election, some of the people said.<br />Republicans who voted to challenge the election are responding as well, warning that companies are denigrating politicians whom they have come to rely on for advancing favorable legislation, according to congressional aides and fundraising consultants."
