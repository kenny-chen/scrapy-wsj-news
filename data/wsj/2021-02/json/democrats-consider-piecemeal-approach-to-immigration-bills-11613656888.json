    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats in Congress and progressive advocates are coalescing around a strategy to try to pass immigration bills piecemeal, as the Biden administration looks for ways to enact a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants without a permanent legal status.<br />As President Biden’s comprehensive immigration bill—which he outlined on his first day in office—is set to formally be introduced in Congress on Thursday, Democrats are pursuing several tracks at once, aiming to see if the comprehensive bill gains any traction while simultaneously pushing other bills to offer legal pathways to narrower immigrant populations.<br />“If there are moving vehicles where parts of this can happen, I think all of us would certainly say we want to...attach significant elements to a moving vehicle,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) said in a call with reporters Thursday.<br />White House officials have used similar language with immigration advocates, saying they were embracing the approach of “multiple trains leaving the station,” according to two people familiar with their thinking.<br />Mr. Menendez said he has already spoken to Republicans who might not be on board with the entire proposal but have said they are interested in various elements."
