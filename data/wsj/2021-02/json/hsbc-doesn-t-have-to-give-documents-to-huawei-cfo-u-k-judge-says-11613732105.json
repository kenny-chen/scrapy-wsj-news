    "body": "HSBC  Holdings PLC doesn’t need to hand over banking documents requested by Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou as part of her effort to resist a U.S. extradition order, a judge in London’s High Court said.<br />Ms. Meng, who filed a lawsuit at the U.K. court, was arrested by Canadian police in 2018 on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice, which has accused her in a criminal case of misleading HSBC about Huawei’s business ties in Iran while the country was subject to U.S. sanctions.<br />Huawei is one of China’s top companies and a global leader in telecommunications equipment. Ms. Meng asked the court in London, where HSBC is based, to obtain documents that her lawyers said would prove she didn’t mislead the bank. She is currently living in Vancouver under bail terms requiring her to wear an ankle monitor and be supervised by court-appointed security.<br />“I have no jurisdiction to make the order sought,” Judge Michael Fordham said Friday.<br />An HSBC spokeswoman said the bank was pleased with the court’s ruling, saying the bank wasn’t party to the underlying U.S. case or the extradition request in Canada."
