    "body": "LIMA, Peru—After Peru’s death toll from Covid-19 surged last fall, nearly 500 politically connected people, including then-President Martin Vizcarra, were secretly given a Chinese vaccine, according to Peru’s government.<br />The revelation that government consultants, lobbyists, cabinet ministers and the former president and his family were inoculated starting in September—before the vaccine was approved by Peruvian authorities—has resulted in a roiling scandal now dubbed Vaccine Gate.<br />Peru’s health minister and other top officials have resigned, and prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into what happened with the 2,000 undisclosed shots from a Chinese government-owned company.<br />“I feel outraged and furious with this situation,” said President Francisco Sagasti, who took over the presidency after Mr. Vizcarra was impeached in November. “Those who have been involved in these totally improper and inappropriate acts won’t have a place in my government.”<br />Last week, Peru announced the first vaccines had arrived, and a batch was taken to Lima’s Archbishop Loayza Hospital to inject into doctors."
