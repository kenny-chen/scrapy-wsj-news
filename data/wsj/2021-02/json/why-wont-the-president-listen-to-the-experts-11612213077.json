    "body": "President Joe Biden is still claiming the economy needs another massive “rescue” bill from Washington. But even the swamp’s official forecasters are expecting a good year for economic growth in the U.S.<br />The Congressional Budget Office, an institution created by Congress in 1974 to enable higher spending, is not exactly a bastion of free-market economics.
