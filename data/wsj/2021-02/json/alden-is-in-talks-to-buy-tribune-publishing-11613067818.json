    "body": "A hedge fund that owns a big stake in  Tribune Publishing Co.  is in talks to buy the newspaper chain behind titles including the Chicago Tribune and New York Daily News.<br />Alden Global Capital LLC, Tribune’s largest shareholder with a 32% stake, is discussing a deal with the publishing company to buy the shares it doesn’t already own, according to people familiar with the matter. A deal for Tribune could be reached this month, the people said, though they cautioned that the negotiations are far from over and could still fall apart.<br />Details couldn’t be learned. Tribune had a market value of around $560 million early Thursday.<br />Alden made an offer late last year to buy the shares for $14.25 apiece. They have been trading above that level since the bid was disclosed, suggesting investors expect a deal at a higher price. Tribune stock was trading at around $15.13 Thursday afternoon.<br />Tribune appointed a special board committee of independent directors to review the proposal but hasn’t yet said anything publicly beyond that."
