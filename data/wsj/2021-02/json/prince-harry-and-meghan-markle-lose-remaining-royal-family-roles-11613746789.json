    "body": "LONDON—Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle will be stripped of their remaining royal duties, Buckingham Palace said, confirming the couple’s total official break with the British royal family following a year-long review.<br />The announcement brings to conclusion a tumultuous episode for the house of Windsor, which followed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s surprise decision last year to quit the royal fold. Prince Harry and Meghan, who now reside in California, confirmed to Queen Elizabeth they would no longer be working members of the royal family, the palace said.<br />The couple will lose their roles as patrons of a variety of national military, sporting and cultural organizations. Prince Harry will lose several honorary military titles, including Captain General of the Royal Marines and Commodore-in-Chief, Small Ships and Diving in the Royal Navy. The Duchess of Sussex will also lose appointments including her patronage of the National Theatre.<br />“While all are saddened by their decision, The Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family,” the palace said.<br />A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said they remained committed to their duty and service to the U.K."
