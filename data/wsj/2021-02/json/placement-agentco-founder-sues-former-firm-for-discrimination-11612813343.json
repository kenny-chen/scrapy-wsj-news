    "body": "A co-founder of placement agent Mercury Capital Advisors Group LP is suing his former firm, claiming he was pushed out as its management sought to eliminate women and minorities from positions of authority.<br />Alan Pardee alleged in a Feb. 1 suit filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for New York County that he was sidelined from his management role and unfairly demoted last year, and is suing for at least $6.6 million, plus other fees and damages.<br />Mr. Pardee, who is biracial and partly of Dominican descent, alleges Mercury Capital Advisors over the past decade has “become a safe space for white men only,” where women and people of color are harassed.<br />New York-based Mercury, which raises capital for private-equity firms, spun out of Merrill Lynch’s private-funds group in 2009 and was founded by Mr. Pardee, Michael Ricciardi and Enrique Cuan.<br />A spokesman for Mercury said by email that it “wished Mr. Pardee well when he left the firm after 11 years of service” and “it is unfortunate that he has elected to make these false allegations against Mercury and its representatives in pursuit of his own financial gain. We believe the claims are baseless and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves.”"
