    "body": "The flash mob that drove up the price of  GameStop Corp.  and other heavily shorted stocks took Wall Street by surprise. In the cryptocurrency market, such behavior is commonplace.<br />Groups of investors who organize on social media and target a specific asset—often one small and illiquid enough to be easily influenced—are a staple of the crypto world. Although digital currencies have made inroads with professional investors, they are also still subject to pumping schemes that proliferate on social-media platforms like Discord and Telegram.<br />The prevalence of such ploys, going back nearly a decade to the early days of the crypto industry, suggest that the mania surrounding GameStop on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum may not be an isolated event in the stock market. A similar, temporary spike also occurred last week in the silver market.<br />“It’s definitely an awakening of small retail traders that there’s power in numbers, and that’s come from crypto,” said Kain Warwick, the founder of Synthetix, a crypto-focused derivatives platform. “We realized that a long time ago.”<br />Another similarity between crypto and WallStreetBets: Free tools, like online trading apps and message boards, promote what early bitcoin adapters called the democratization of finance. Bitcoin was created 12 years ago as a decentralized currency that would be free from the interference of bankers and other middlemen."
