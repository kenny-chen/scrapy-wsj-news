For next week we’ll ask about President Biden’s proposal to cancel $10,000 in student-loan debt per student. Click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Feb. 23.

Grid failures will only become more common as the left continues to sabotage America’s No. 1 power source.<br />Prior to starting graduate school, I worked as an engineer on natural-gas pipelines in Texas. I saw how a radical, antiscience faction on the political left does everything in its power to make building, operating and maintaining gas pipelines prohibitively difficult. Pandering to these activists and voters, Democratic leaders impede natural-gas projects through punitive regulations, endless reviews and flat-out refusals to approve new projects. Ironically, those quickest to blame natural gas for this current crisis in Texas are the ones who have worked the hardest to create barriers to the improvement, modernization and expansion of America’s pipelines."
