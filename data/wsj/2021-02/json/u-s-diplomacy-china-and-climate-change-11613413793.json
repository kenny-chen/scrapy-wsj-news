    "body": "Regarding John Bolton’s “Beijing Won’t Let America ‘Compartmentalize’ Climate Change” (op-ed, Feb. 4): It is naive to think that, in John Kerry’s words, climate change would ever be treated by the Chinese as “a critical stand-alone issue.” In fact, the Chinese will slow roll us on this crucial topic, as they do on every other matter, and at best offer toothless concessions on the climate in exchange for the U.S. ignoring the Uighurs, abandoning Taiwan and handing the South China Sea over to the Chinese navy.<br />The Chinese government has no choice but to come to grips with the effects of climate change in China. No nation burns more coal, has worse smog or more heavily pollutes the environment. There are more cars in China than in any other country, many without pollution controls of any kind, and more coal-burning power plants than in any country in the world. Even a totalitarian government like China’s will have to respond to the demands of its own citizens for cleaner skies and an end to lung-damaging pollution. The U.S. would be well advised to leave China out of the negotiations on any treaty, have the other nations of the world negotiate and sign it and then let China decide if it wants to be the international pariah of climate change.<br />James F.
