    "body": "Blocks from Fidelity’s headquarters, a team of quants toil in relative anonymity. They’re also a key weapon in the investment firm’s fight to take on all rivals, from Vanguard Group to Robinhood Markets Inc.<br />Geode Capital Management Inc. was spun out of the Boston-based firm nearly two decades ago. At the time, Fidelity Investments Inc. was content to be undercut by rivals in the low-cost index business and didn’t want to overshadow its powerful and famous stock pickers.<br />Today, Geode is the key plank in the firm’s effort to lower the costs of investing across all of its businesses. It has helped Fidelity gain back ground lost to passive-investing giants Vanguard and  BlackRock Inc.  It has also drawn new clients to the firm in the era of no-commission trades. The investments Geode manages helped Fidelity lift assets under administration—or what investors held in brokerage and retirement accounts and in its funds—to $8.8 trillion in September from $8.32 trillion at the end of 2019..<br />Geode now manages some $720 billion, up from less than $100 billion a decade ago and more than household names such as  Blackstone Group Inc.,   Eaton Vance Corp.  and Putnam Investments.<br />“It’s one of the best-kept secrets in asset management,” said Ben Johnson, director of global exchange-traded fund research at Morningstar."
