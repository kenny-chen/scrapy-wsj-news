    "body": "<br /><br /><br />The first sound we hear on “Hardline”—the opening track from “Little Oblivions” (Matador), the new album by 25-year-old Julien Baker—is a heavy chord from an organ that brings to mind the sanctity of church but also, with its woolly distortion, distress. In the context of Ms. Baker’s oeuvre, this sound alone marks a major shift.<br />Her first album, 2015’s “Sprained Ankle,” a collection of shadowy folk numbers, almost exclusively featured her voice, acoustic guitar, and a bit of piano. On 2017’s acclaimed follow-up, “Turn Out the Lights,” she plugged her instrument into an amp and added touches of strings and woodwinds, but the record was drum-free and still spare in the extreme. Yet that organ chord on “Hardline” and the percussion that enters shortly after suggest that we’re in for a different kind of experience on album number three, one where instrumental color and sharper melodies share the load with Ms. Baker’s dark lyrics and expressive singing."
