Read previous columns here.<br />When a winter storm blanketed the Northeast this week, it shut down cities, snarled traffic and dumped as much as 30 inches of snowfall in parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But was it a “blizzard?”<br />Not if you ask the National Weather Service. Their reports on the storm avoided the word “blizzard,” instead referring to it as a “large scale snowstorm and Nor’easter.”<br />The storm matched the general profile of a “Nor’easter,” since it moved along the East Coast with powerful winds blowing in from the northeast. But the weather service uses a specific definition of “blizzard” favored by meteorologists. For a storm to qualify, it must have sustained gusts of wind in excess of 35 miles an hour for at least three hours, with the blowing snow limiting visibility to less than a quarter of a mile.<br />This week’s snowstorm evidently did not make the cut—unlike, say, the twin blizzards in January and February 1978 that hit the central and northeastern U.S. with historic strength. This time around, the ingredients of a blizzard—the falling or blowing snow, the sustained winds, and the reduced visibility—may have all been in play individually but did not occur together for three hours."
