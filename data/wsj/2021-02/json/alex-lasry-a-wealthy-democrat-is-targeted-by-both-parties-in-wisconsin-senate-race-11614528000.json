    "body": "Alex Lasry might be swimming upstream as he seeks the U.S. Senate nomination in Wisconsin from a Democratic Party skeptical of Wall Street and worried about income inequality.<br />The 33-year-old is a former Goldman Sachs analyst and son of Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge-fund manager and co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team.<br />The race, in a state decided by less than 1 percentage point in November’s presidential election, will be among the most important nationally in 2022 for determining Senate control. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, a strong ally of former President Donald Trump who once pledged to retire after two terms, hasn’t yet indicated whether he’ll seek a third.<br />Mr. Lasry, a Wisconsin resident since 2014 who announced his candidacy Feb. 17, has triggered a rare moment of bipartisan agreement between national Republicans and some Wisconsin Democrats.<br />The National Republican Senatorial Committee has labeled him a “spoiled rich kid,” while another announced Democratic candidate in the race, Tom Nelson, is saying similar things, albeit in a more polite, Midwestern tone."
