    "body": "The Biden administration is considering using executive action to forgive Americans’ federal student debt, the White House’s chief spokeswoman said Thursday, responding to pressure from Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups.<br />President Biden has previously questioned his ability to use executive action to forgive some or all of Americans’ federal student debt. He has instead urged Congress to pass legislation to write off $10,000 in student debt for every borrower.<br />The White House shifted Thursday, saying it was open to forgiving debt without a move by Congress. “Our team is reviewing whether there are any steps he can take through executive action and he would welcome the opportunity to sign a bill sent to him by Congress,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter.<br />Ms. Psaki’s comments followed a news conference earlier Thursday held by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Reps. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (D., Mass.), Alma Adams (D., N.C.) and Mondaire Jones (D., N.Y.)<br />Mr. Schumer urged Mr. Biden to use his executive powers to eliminate $50,000 in student loan debt for all borrowers."
