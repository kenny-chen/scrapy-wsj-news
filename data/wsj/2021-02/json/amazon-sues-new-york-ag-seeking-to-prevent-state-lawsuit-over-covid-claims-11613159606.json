    "body": "Amazon.com Inc.  is suing New York’s attorney general to prevent the state from potentially taking legal action against the company over its handling of worker safety during the Covid-19 pandemic and firing of one of its warehouse workers last year.<br />In a complaint filed Friday in federal court in Brooklyn, Amazon said that New York Attorney General Letitia James has threatened to sue the company if it doesn’t agree to a list of demands, including reducing its production speeds and performance requirements and paying “large sums” to Christian Smalls, the fired worker.<br />The state “lacks the legal authority it purports to wield against Amazon,” the Seattle-based company said in the complaint, arguing that its operations are “governed by federal law and enforced by federal regulators.”<br />Amazon is asking a judge to rule that Ms. James lacks the authority to regulate workplace safety and prevent her from pursuing litigation against the company over the issue.<br />“We will not be intimidated by anyone, especially corporate bullies that put profits over the health and safety of working people,” Ms. James said in a statement Friday. “We remain undeterred in our efforts to protect workers from exploitation and will continue to review all of our legal options.”"
