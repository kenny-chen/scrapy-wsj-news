    "body": "President Biden spoke by phone Thursday with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, as the White House reviews U.S. policy toward the kingdom and the administration prepares to release an unclassified report on the role of Saudi officials in the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.<br />The White House said the two leaders discussed regional security, including diplomatic efforts to end the war in Yemen, as well as a U.S. commitment to help the kingdom defend its territory from groups aligned with Iran.<br />Mr. Biden also “affirmed the importance the United States places on universal human rights and the rule of law,” according to the White House, while touting the recent release of detained Saudi-American activists and prominent women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul.<br />Saudi officials in a statement in Riyadh about the call said Mr. Biden also told the king he wouldn’t allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has said it is pursuing a nuclear-energy program, but has denied it is seeking to build weapons.<br />The call took place as the White House works to recalibrate its relationship with Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the importance of human rights and stressing accountability for Mr. Khashoggi’s death."
