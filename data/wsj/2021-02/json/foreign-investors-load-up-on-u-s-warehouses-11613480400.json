    "body": "Foreign property investors, long drawn to Manhattan skyscrapers, coastal resorts or urban shopping corridors, are increasingly directing their attention to suburban warehouses.<br />The changing attitudes are the latest sign of how the Covid-19 pandemic is shaking up the U.S. real-estate market, leading both domestic and overseas investors to rethink their priorities.<br />The central office districts of New York, San Francisco and Chicago have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic’s economic fallout. Meanwhile, surging e-commerce deliveries are driving up demand for warehouses, particularly those leased to large companies like  Amazon.com Inc.<br />Foreign buyers “see that type of investment as effectively a corporate bond given by one of the largest companies in the world,” said Matthew Alshouse, a partner at law firm DLA Piper.<br />A subsidiary of France’s AXA Investment Managers in December bought a majority stake in 27 U.S. logistics facilities from Cabot Properties for $875 million. That same month, Germany’s  Allianz Real Estate  said it agreed to buy a 49% stake in a U.S. logistics portfolio in partnership with Crow Holdings."
