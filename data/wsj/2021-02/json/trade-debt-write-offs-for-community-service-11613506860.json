    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Great Student Loan Scam” (Feb. 10): I would readily support loan forgiveness if the beneficiary were required to do community service for the forgiven debt. I would suggest a rate of $15 an hour, the Biden administration proposed federal minimum wage. So for someone being forgiven $15,000 in debt, he or she would owe 1,000 hours of community service.<br />Jeff Kindl<br />Mandeville, La.<br /><br />You conclude that Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is putting off a vote on student-debt forgiveness because it is only popular with “progressive elites.” Based on our polling, we know support is much broader than that. With backing from two-thirds of people under 56 years old, a majority of American adults say the government should actually annul all student debt. Even boomers, who by a slight majority oppose voiding any student loans, overwhelmingly want the government to insert itself into the marketplace and impose price controls on the cost of higher education."
