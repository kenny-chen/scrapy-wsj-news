    "body": "Two great lessons arise from the 2020 pandemic, neither of which will be cited in the standard summaries.<br />The first was taught in quick succession by Wuhan and then northern Italy. When hospitals visibly break down, constraints on political action, much of it ill-advised, will tend to disappear.<br />The second lesson concerns the vaccine. A miscalculation was the idea that, despite the emergency, adherence to existing testing protocols would encourage public confidence. This has now been disproved. Surveys and lengthy news investigations show that tens of millions, including many health-care workers, distrust a product developed at speed behind closed doors in double-blind clinical trials.<br />Early in the pandemic, outside experts urged so-called challenge trials, in which volunteers are deliberately exposed to the virus. An organization, 1 Day Sooner, signed up thousands of would-be participants. Rolling out the candidate vaccines as early as possible to willing volunteers, their fellow citizens and the media could have witnessed the results, which they can’t in double-blind studies where neither the subjects nor the administrator know who got the vaccine.<br />Not only would shots have gotten into millions of arms sooner. The risks of such an approach would have been merely substantial and the potential benefits off-the-charts, measured in trillions of dollars and thousands of lives saved."
