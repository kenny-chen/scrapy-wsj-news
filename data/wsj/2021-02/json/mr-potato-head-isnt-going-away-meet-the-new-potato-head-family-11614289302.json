    "body": "Mr. Potato Head, welcome to 2021.<br />Toy maker  Hasbro Inc.  said it is dropping the “Mister” from the brand name of its Mr. Potato Head toy and will introduce a boxed set with enough plastic potatoes and accessories for kids to create all types of families.<br />The change to the 70-year-old brand will appear on boxes this year, the company said, but Hasbro will continue to sell Mr. Potato Head, which features a bushy mustache and blue pants, and Mrs. Potato head with a pink purse and red painted lips.<br />“While we’re renaming the Mr. Potato Head brand to Potato Head to better reflect the full line, the iconic Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters aren’t going anywhere and will remain Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head,” a spokesman said.<br />The new playset comes with enough parts and pieces that kids have more flexibility to shape their potato families outside of traditional norms, said Kimberly Boyd, a Hasbro senior vice president."
