    "body": "Worker applications for unemployment benefits are expected to have eased again last week, potentially adding to signs that layoffs are declining as the economic recovery picks up.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast that the number of workers applying for unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 773,000 last week, down slightly from 793,000 the prior week.<br />Jobless claims—a proxy for layoffs—remain above the pre-coronavirus pandemic peak of 695,000, but have fallen from 926,000 in early January.<br />“We’re heading in the right direction,” said Marianne Wanamaker, a labor economist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and former adviser to the Trump White House. “I just don’t think we’re going to get there very quickly.”<br />While the initial reopening of the economy last summer from pandemic-related closures led to quick labor market gains, Ms. Wanamaker said she expects job growth over the next few months to be more gradual."
