    "body": "BUFFALO, Minn.—Multiple victims were taken to a local hospital after a shooting at a Minnesota health clinic Tuesday, authorities said.<br />The shooting, at Allina Health Clinic in Buffalo, Minn., also involved improvised explosive devices, said Gov. Tim Walz at an afternoon news conference. Mr. Walz said the violence appeared to be the work of a single person, and said a suspect is in custody. It is too soon to tell a motive, Mr. Walz said.<br />State public safety agencies on Twitter said they were assisting in the response. Authorities didn’t say how many people were shot, or if anyone was killed, but the Minnesota State Patrol said its pilots were flying six boxes of blood to the Buffalo Hospital for the victims. The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also at the scene, Mr. Walz said, due to the explosives involved.<br />The shooting occurred at the Allina Clinic Crossroads campus and was contained just before noon, Police Chief Pat Budke said on local TV station KSTP.<br />Allina Health spokesman Tim Burke referred questions to local authorities. He didn’t know whether the clinic was administering Covid-19 vaccinations Tuesday."
