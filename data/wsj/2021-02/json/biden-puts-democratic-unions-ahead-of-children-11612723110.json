    "body": "Regarding William McGurn’s “Catholic Schools Are Beating Covid” (Main Street, Feb. 2): Jeanne Allen of the Center for Education Reform asks whether President Biden “will support efforts to ensure that poor and working-class kids just like him will have the same life-defining opportunity he had.” There is but one assured answer and that is a resounding “no.” President Biden is in thrall to the powerful teachers’ unions which have adamantly opposed all efforts at reform, including opposition to charter schools, standardized tests and teacher-performance evaluation programs, all of which have proven to be a huge embarrassment to their priorities—union members first, second and third, with kids and parents somewhere below that. He will undoubtedly adhere to the same policies as the Obama administration, which blocked thousands of poor, black students in Louisiana from benefiting from a school-choice program intended to help them.<br />M.
