    "body": "China’s car sales surged in January from the low base of a year earlier, when the coronavirus began sweeping the world’s largest auto market.<br />Retail sales of passenger cars rose 25.7% to 2.16 million vehicles last month compared with the same time a year before, the China Passenger Car Association said Monday, the strongest growth since September 2016.<br />Business shutdowns caused by Covid-19 hit the auto market hard early last year. Sales slumped by 20% in January last year and closed in December with a 7% decline for the year.<br />Although the CPCA earlier forecast that car sales would grow 7% in 2021, the market could see pressure in the second half, said Cui Dongshu, the group’s secretary-general.<br />The stronger-than-expected recovery in the auto market is caught up in the recent chip shortage, forcing car makers including  Volkswagen AG  to cut production in China. Car makers are first using available chips for their most profitable and bestselling models, and analysts predict that the effects will linger until March. Many global brands will be more affected than local Chinese brands, Fitch Ratings analysts said."
