    "body": "WASHINGTON—Top financial regulators set to meet Thursday to discuss the market tumult related to  GameStop Corp.  and other stocks are unlikely to reach any conclusions on whether the activity points to risks to financial stability or the need for regulatory changes, former officials and analysts said.<br />Instead, the meeting called by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is viewed as an initial discussion about the trading frenzy and a sign that the new administration is dealing with the issue at a time when some top financial positions aren’t yet filled with Senate-confirmed officials.<br />“It sends a signal that the lights are on, that you’re paying attention,” said Tony Fratto, a Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration.<br />Mr. Fratto said it makes sense for Ms. Yellen to lead on an issue that has rocked markets, raised questions about the role of social media in trading and drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers.<br />Thursday’s gathering will involve officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
