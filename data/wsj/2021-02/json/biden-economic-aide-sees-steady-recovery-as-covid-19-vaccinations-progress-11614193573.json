    "body": "WASHINGTON—Economic activity will pick up as the pandemic recedes and Americans are vaccinated against Covid-19, but the recovery will be gradual rather than sudden, a top economic adviser to President Biden said Wednesday.<br />“It is a dimmer switch, not an on-off switch,” Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said at a Wall Street Journal Executive Membership Series event. “People are not going to snap back into action on some set date because the vaccine penetration rate hits 53% or whatever. It’s going to be more gradual.”<br />Mr. Bernstein defended the president’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan against critics who say it risks overheating the economy and generating inflation. He acknowledged that rising inflation is a potential risk, but that a weak recovery that leads to scarring for households and businesses—such as long-term unemployment, foreclosures and bankruptcies—would do more harm.<br />“There is room for more heat,” he said, pointing to data on weekly claims for unemployment benefits, which came to 861,000 in the most recent report, and elevated jobless rates in minority communities as evidence of spare capacity in the economy.<br />Mr. Bernstein pointed to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said Tuesday that he doesn’t expect a temporary burst of federal spending to cause a large or persistent rise in inflation."
