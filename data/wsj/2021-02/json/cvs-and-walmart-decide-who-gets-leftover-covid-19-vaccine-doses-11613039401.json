    "body": "As pharmacies and groceries across the U.S. prepare to dispense Covid-19 vaccines to the public, their customers and workers are wondering what happens to extra doses left unused at day’s end—and who might get access to one.<br />The companies say they are determined that no doses will go to waste, and are compiling wait lists and putting their own workers on standby in case extra shots become available.<br />Some 6,500 pharmacies in all 50 states—including those at  CVS Health Corp. ,  Walmart Inc.  and regional grocers—will get 1 million doses from the federal government starting Thursday.<br />There is no charge to receive the vaccine, but the chains require customers who are eligible under state rules to schedule an appointment.<br />The question of what to do with extra shots can be tricky, though. Doses, which can expire within hours after coming out of cold storage, might go unclaimed if people don’t show for appointments, or if vials contain more doses than expected."
