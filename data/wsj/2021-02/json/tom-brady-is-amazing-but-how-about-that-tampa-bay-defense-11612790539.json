    "body": "What Tom Brady’s done is absurd. His career was absurd before this, of course, mocking the standard trajectory for a football quarterback, but the absurdity has truly become something to behold.<br />He’s really gone and done it now. The Brady reverence was suffocating in the weeks heading into this Super Bowl, and it will be even more suffocating now that he’s done it, won Super Bowl No. 7, with a new team, in a new city, in a new conference, after leaving Bill Belichick and a Patriots dynasty…and even still, I wonder if we’re moderately underselling it, how amazing it is, what he’s accomplished, at the defiant age of 43.<br />With Tampa Bay, Brady’s added a deeply personal chapter.<br />To win and win throughout your career, but to do it in the same shop, repeatedly, a bit mechanically, to the point that people start to wonder if it’s more about the shop, and less about you, and then to leave, bittersweetly, for another shop, a new coach, and a whole fresh set of co-workers, and win it again, right away?<br />Brady is not the type of athlete to publicly parse his emotions, but it’s got to be one of the most satisfying feelings in sports."
