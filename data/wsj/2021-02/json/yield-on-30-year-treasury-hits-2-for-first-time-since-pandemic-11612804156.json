    "body": "The yield of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond pushed past 2% Monday for the first time since February 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic roiled government-debt markets.<br />The move comes amid a recent surge in yields of longer-term Treasury bonds compared with short-term debt, as traders bet that government stimulus will accelerate a rebound in economic growth.<br />Bond investors closely watch the differential between interest rates on short and longer-dated Treasurys as a bellwether for growth and inflation, both of which can push bond yields up as the Federal Reserve raises short-term rates and investors demand higher returns to lend out capital.<br />That bodes well for corporations, consumers and the banks that lend to them but poorly for investors who buy Treasury bonds in the near term.<br />“You get these psychological levels and 2% is a big one for the market,” said Michael Contopoulos, director of fixed income at Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC."
