    "body": "From “Public policy and health in the Trump era,” a Feb. 10 report by the Lancet, a British medical journal:<br /><br />Trump exploited low and middle-income white people’s anger over their deteriorating life prospects to mobilise racial animus and xenophobia. . . . His appeals to racism, nativism, and religious bigotry have emboldened white nationalists and vigilantes, and encouraged police violence and, at the end of his term in office, insurrection. He chose judges for US courts who are dismissive of affirmative action and reproductive, labour, civil, and voting rights; ordered the mass detention of immigrants in hazardous conditions; and promulgated regulations that reduce access to abortion and contraception in the USA and globally."
