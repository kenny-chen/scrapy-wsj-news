    "body": "Fashion designer Christopher John Rogers had a rollercoaster 2020 as the pandemic thrust his small but growing label into uncertainty.<br />Then Inauguration Day happened.<br />The designer, a 27-year-old native of Baton Rouge, La., was at his home in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y., watching the ceremony on television with a group that included his team members. He had been asked to provide an outfit for Vice President Kamala Harris but knew other designers had also submitted offerings. The choice wouldn’t be clear until she appeared. When she emerged, she was wearing his purple coat and dress.<br />“We didn’t know what would happen so we were just kind of watching generally, and then when she came out, we were very, very excited,” Mr. Rogers says. “I was speechless.”<br />Throughout that morning, Mr. Rogers heard commentators repeat his name live on air while social media lit up with mentions, spreading his name across the world. He and his team fielded congratulatory phone calls, messages and inquiries—and celebrated the moment. “We had mimosas,” Mr. Rogers says."
