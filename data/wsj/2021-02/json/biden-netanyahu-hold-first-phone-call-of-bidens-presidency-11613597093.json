    "body": "President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held their first phone call of Mr. Biden’s presidency on Wednesday, the White House said, noting a shared commitment “to strengthen all aspects of the U.S.-Israel partnership.”<br />The two leaders discussed the future of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Iran and other regional issues, and reaffirmed cooperation between the two governments on security and defense in the Middle East.<br />Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Mr. Biden said it was a “good conversation.” Mr. Netanyahu’s office said the call “was very warm and friendly” and lasted roughly one hour.<br />The Israeli government has been preparing for a change in the U.S. approach to the region under Mr. Biden, after enjoying close ties to former President Donald Trump. The Trump administration pursued a Middle East strategy that was largely aligned with Israeli priorities.<br />Last year, the Trump administration brokered peace deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. Mr. Biden expressed his support for that push during his call with Mr. Netanyahu, the White House said."
