    "body": "Some of the world’s biggest drugmakers are joining forces with rivals to help produce Covid-19 vaccines, forging unusual alliances that promise to substantially increase supplies by this summer.<br />Normally big pharmaceutical companies compete to sell cancer, arthritis and other drugs. The desperate need for Covid-19 vaccines, however, is turning fierce industry competitors into fast pandemic friends.<br />Sanofi SA  recently agreed to help make a vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and its partner  BioNTech SE  after Sanofi’s experimental Covid-19 shot suffered a five-month setback, freeing up a production line in Frankfurt.<br />“We were looking to contribute,” said Thomas Triomphe, executive vice president for vaccines for Sanofi, which will start in June performing a crucial final step to make 125 million doses.<br />Novartis AG  also agreed to help Pfizer and BioNTech produce more doses, while  Baxter International Inc.  and  Endo International  PLC have agreed to help  Novavax Inc.  produce its shot."
