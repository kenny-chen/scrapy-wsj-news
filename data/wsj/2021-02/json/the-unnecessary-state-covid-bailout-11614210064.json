    "body": "Democrats in Congress are planning to ladle out another $350 billion to state and local governments, though many haven’t finished spending their Cares Act checks and some are running budget surpluses. This is income redistribution for public unions.<br />About one third of the $150 billion that Congress allocated in direct aid to state and local governments last spring still hasn’t been spent. These funds were intended to help governments cover pandemic needs amid budget shortfalls, but most haven’t needed it.<br />Research outfit Wirepoints recently estimated that 44 states are running surpluses for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 when Covid relief and budget reserves are included. The six outliers: New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, Hawaii, Nevada. They have pre-existing spending problems or rely heavily on tourism.<br />Nearly half of states rolled in more tax revenue in calendar year 2020 than 2019, according to the Reason Foundation. On average, state revenues were a mere 0.01% lower across the board. Seventeen state treasurers recently moaned to Congress that “tax revenues have plummeted,” but collectively they’ve seen a 1.8% increase year-over-year, the Kansas Policy Institute reports.<br />Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently warned of a $15 billion budget deficit and threatened to raise New York’s top income tax rate to 14.7%—the nation’s highest—though New York’s revenues were down a mere 1.5% from 2019. He refuses to renegotiate union contracts or cut spending."
