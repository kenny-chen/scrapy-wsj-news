    "body": "In “How Economics Lost Itself in Data” (op-ed, Jan. 28), Prof. Alexander William Salter argues that the current generation of economists have “serious theoretical blind spots” because they abandoned price theory in pursuit of data. It’s absolutely true that “data doesn’t interpret itself.” Equally true: Whoever chooses the data set can control the outcome.<br />All the more reason we still need price theory; among other things, it cautions us about utopian visions that pay no heed to economic reality. On the other hand, today’s economists—technocrats on the left with grand agendas—seek data of commensurate size. Big data enables big government; bigger data feeds bigger government and the more government grows, the more our liberty contracts. Or, as Mark Twain put it in his autobiography, “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.”<br />Roger H. Leemis<br />Southfield, Mich.<br />"
