    "body": "The 50-50 Senate that is trying to find agreement on a coronavirus relief bill isn’t just evenly split. It is also operating under partisan pressures that, by one measure, are greater than ever.<br />Some 94 senators belong to the party that won their state’s presidential contest in November—a record-high level of party allegiance for at least 54 years, an analysis of data gathered by the Pew Research Center shows. That leaves a record-low six senators as political mismatches with their home state’s presidential choice: Three Democratic senators represent states that backed former President Donald Trump, and three Republicans come from states that President Biden won.<br />Just two weeks since Mr. Biden took office, it remains unclear how the dynamics of the divided Senate will affect his legislative agenda, which includes a proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.<br />With more voters siding with a single party, current and former senators say, it may mean many lawmakers have less flexibility to work with the opposing party to strike deals—a necessity in a chamber where 60 votes are needed to pass most legislation.<br />That presents a potential challenge for Mr. Biden, who has made calls for national unity a central theme of his presidency and has said he wants bipartisan support for his coronavirus response proposal and some other priorities."
