    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats chose not to include an increase in the federal debt ceiling in President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, leaving the often-contentious issue to be addressed later this year.<br />The decision means Democrats will either have to include a debt-limit increase in a second tax-and-spending package that is likely to pass along party lines or negotiate with Republicans to have it added to another bill.<br />If Congress doesn’t act by late summer or early fall, the U.S. will run out of legal borrowing capacity, according to an estimate from the Bipartisan Policy Center. Such a full breach, which has never occurred, could have significant but unpredictable effects on financial markets.<br />In 2011, when Republicans demanded policy changes in exchange for a higher debt limit, stock prices fell amid the uncertainty and a downgrade of the U.S. debt rating by Standard & Poor’s.<br />Democrats are advancing President Biden’s coronavirus relief bill using a process known as budget reconciliation, which would let them increase the federal debt ceiling without any Republican support."
