    "body": "Home Depot Inc.<br />Two giant retailers said the pandemic is not ready to release its grip on their industry yet. A surge in demand for home improvements helped Home Depot’s revenue increase 20% in its latest fiscal year, while annual sales at  Macy’s  tumbled nearly 30%. Both sold more online. The retailers said these trends continue in 2021 but could change later this year as vaccines roll out. Home Depot shares fell 3.1% Tuesday, while Macy’s shares added 3.9%.<br />Salesforce.com Inc.<br />Salesforce.com set its sights higher for 2021, but investors may need convincing. The business-software provider posted record sales and lifted its outlook for the current year on Thursday, as the company expands its services in a bid to challenge rivals such as  Microsoft Corp.  The company in December struck its biggest-ever acquisition, the $27.7 billion proposed acquisition of workplace message company  Slack Technologies Inc.  Salesforce said on Thursday that Slack would help boost its top line for this fiscal year by around $600 million. But investors have been wary about the deal for Slack, which loses money. Salesforce shares have lost more than 10% since The Wall Street Journal first reported deal talks. Salesforce shares fell 6.3% Friday.<br />Best Buy Co."
