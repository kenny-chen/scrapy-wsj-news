    "body": "HONG KONG—Beijing’s censors appeared to slam the door on Clubhouse, Silicon Valley’s latest social-media hit, after a frenzied week in which the audio-only chat app helped spark a rare outpouring of freewheeling debate on taboo topics in the Chinese-speaking world.<br />On Monday evening, Clubhouse users from Beijing to Shenzhen said their chats—some of which touched on the plight of China’s Uighur Muslims or the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989—were disconnected mid-conversation, replaced by an error message.<br />Thousands then quickly swamped newly created Clubhouse chat rooms to confirm the blockage after climbing back in using a virtual private network to circumvent China’s internet firewall.<br />Some said new user registrations were impossible because text messages with access codes were no longer being sent to phones.<br />After comparing notes, they concluded that Chinese censorship was the likely culprit. Many Clubhouse users in China had been anticipating a crackdown on the app in the week since the invite-only app began gathering large numbers of new users in the country."
