    "body": "Two of the nation’s best-known sellers of insurance—Allstate Corp. and MetLife Inc.—delivered fourth-quarter results bolstered partly by Covid-19 business shutdowns and stay-at-home directives.<br />Allstate’s net income surged 52% to $2.6 billion, while net income at the big New York life insurer fell 77% to $124 million. MetLife’s decline was primarily related to mark-to-market losses on the financial hedges it buys to protect the company from falling interest rates and stock markets.<br />When rates and equities rise, as they did in the fourth quarter, the value of that protection falls. Wall Street analysts treat those declines as noneconomic and focus on adjusted earnings, which were nearly flat at $1.838 billion at MetLife from $1.834 billion in the year-ago period.<br />Allstate became the latest car insurer to report robust auto-insurance underwriting profit as the pandemic, and resulting weak U.S. economy, continued to hold down the number of miles motorists drove.<br />Fewer miles led to a sharp reduction in wrecks—and has prompted criticism from some consumer advocacy groups that springtime premium-refund programs weren’t generous enough. In those refund programs, insurers typically slashed 15% to 20% of customers’ premium bills for a couple months."
