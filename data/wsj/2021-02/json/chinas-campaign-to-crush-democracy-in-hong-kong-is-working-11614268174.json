    "body": "HONG KONG—Just eight months after Beijing imposed a new national-security law to quell a pro-democracy movement, this freewheeling former British colony has all but been brought to heel.<br />Moving with a scope and speed few here anticipated, authorities have used the law to stamp out street protests, ban activists from lobbying foreign governments, gut the city’s legislature and arrest most of the opposition.<br />“Everything that’s happening in Hong Kong today was unimaginable a year ago,” political satirist Sam Ng, whose show was taken off air by a government broadcaster last year, told his 250,000 YouTube followers in January.<br />Beijing is signaling that this is just the start, outlining more institutional changes to ensure complete control over the city’s governance and eject opponents. China’s leaders are planning to revamp election rules that select Hong Kong’s top officials as well as grass-roots legislators. The proposals are expected to be formalized at its annual legislation meeting in early March.<br />Hong Kong can only be governed by “patriots” who aren’t opposed to the Communist Party’s leadership, Xia Baolong, the chief of Beijing’s office on Hong Kong affairs, said in a policy speech this week in Beijing. “Those who violate Hong Kong’s national security law aren’t patriots.”"
