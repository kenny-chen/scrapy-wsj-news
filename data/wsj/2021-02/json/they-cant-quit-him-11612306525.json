    "body": "No media outlets worked harder than CNN and MSNBC to promote Donald Trump’s quest for the Republican nomination for president in 2016. Their investment of massive airtime certainly paid off, as the Trump era turned out to be a golden age for political controversy and news-like programming.<br />Back in 2015, staff at the two networks were likely happy to enlist in the Trump promotion project because they figured he was the Republican most likely to lose to Hillary Clinton.
