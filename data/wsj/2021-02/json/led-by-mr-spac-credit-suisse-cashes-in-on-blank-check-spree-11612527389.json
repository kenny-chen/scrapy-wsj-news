    "body": "Credit Suisse  Group AG is reaping the rewards from a spree of special-purpose acquisition companies. Leading the charge is a veteran banker who was among the first to bring SPACs to Wall Street 15 years ago.<br />The Swiss bank was the top underwriter of so-called blank-check firms last year and is second in early 2021, figures from data provider SPAC Research show. Its role in the suddenly booming sector has been a bright spot as the bank took $1.3 billion in unexpected charges last year and weathered a spying scandal and high-profile company frauds.<br />Spearheading the blank-check business is head of SPACs Niron Stabinsky, who was hired in 2015 from Deutsche Bank AG. He and Credit Suisse have built relationships with some of the most prominent SPAC founders, including venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, veteran deal maker and Vegas Golden Knights owner Bill Foley, and real-estate investor Barry Sternlicht. That group’s SPACs helped Credit Suisse bring in seven of the 10 biggest blank-check firms last year, according to Dealogic.<br />“Niron has become Mr. SPAC,” said Mr. Foley, who has worked with him on deals for nearly two decades.<br />SPACs founded by Mr. Foley and underwritten by Credit Suisse recently agreed to a $7.3 billion merger to take  Blackstone Group Inc. -backed benefits provider Alight Solutions public and a $9 billion deal to combine with Paysafe Group Holdings Ltd."
