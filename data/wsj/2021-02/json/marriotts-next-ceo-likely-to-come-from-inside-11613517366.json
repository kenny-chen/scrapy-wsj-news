    "body": "Marriott International Inc.  suffered another blow when Arne Sorenson, its chief executive, died from cancer on Monday, but analysts expect the hotel company under new leadership to still manage a gradual recovery from the pandemic’s effect on business.<br />That continuity reflects industry expectations that the next CEO will be chosen from one of two Marriott executives currently leading the company’s day-to-day operations. Mr. Sorenson reduced his responsibilities earlier this month for health reasons.<br />One is Stephanie Linnartz, the group president for consumer operations, technology and emerging businesses. The other is Tony Capuano, group president for global development, design and operations services.<br />Marriott has said the board will select a new chief within two weeks, and one of those two executives is expected to get that role, said a person familiar with the situation.<br />Either of them would be expected to continue a similar strategy for the company, starting with steering it through the remainder of the Covid-19 pandemic, said Carlo Santarelli, analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc."
