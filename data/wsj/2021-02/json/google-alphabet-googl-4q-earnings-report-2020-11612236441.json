    "body": "Google is expected to post a strong fourth quarter as analysts say online holiday spending likely drove an acceleration in digital advertising purchases from the search giant.<br />The internet titan’s fourth-quarter earnings due Tuesday afternoon should reflect a continuing recovery in global ad spending that took a hit in early 2020 when people paused travel plans and other purchases in response to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Analysts forecast Google parent  Alphabet Inc.  to post a record $42.33 billion in advertising revenue, according to FactSet, up from $31.9 billion a year ago. Overall, analysts forecast Alphabet to post $52.67 billion in revenue, also a record, compared with $46.08 billion a year ago.<br />Alphabet’s profit is projected to rise to $11.87 billion, up from $9.3 billion a year ago.<br />Google is also expected to reveal more information about the costs and profitability of its cloud business when it reports its results. Last year, Google said it would break out Google Cloud as a separate reporting segment in the fourth quarter, which means investors will be able to better compare the results of Google’s cloud business with those of  Amazon.com Inc.  and  Microsoft Corp.  Previously, Google reported just the revenue for its cloud unit."
