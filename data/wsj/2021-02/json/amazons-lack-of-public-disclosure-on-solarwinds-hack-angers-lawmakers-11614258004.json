    "body": "<br />As lawmakers and security researchers continue to unravel the SolarWinds hack, some are growing more frustrated with  Amazon.com Inc.,  saying the cloud-computing giant should be more publicly forthcoming about its knowledge of the suspected Russian cyberattack.<br />There are no indications that  Amazon ’s  systems were directly breached, but hackers used its sprawling cloud-computing data centers to launch a key part of the attack, according to security researchers. The operation has been described as one of the worst instances of cyber espionage in the nation’s history.<br />While cybersecurity experts say it is nearly impossible to prevent hackers from misusing cloud services, as is alleged to have occurred in this case, they also say that Amazon is likely sitting on critical information that could shed light on the scope of the attacks and the tactics used by the cybercriminals. U.S. authorities say the intruders are likely Russian intelligence agents.<br />Amazon has shared this information privately with the U.S. government, but unlike other technology companies, it has balked at making it public."
