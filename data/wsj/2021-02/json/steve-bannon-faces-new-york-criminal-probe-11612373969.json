    "body": "Manhattan prosecutors have opened an investigation into Steve Bannon for potential crimes under New York state law after former President Donald Trumppardoned the ex-White House adviser on federal fraud charges, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Mr. Bannon and three other men were arrested Aug. 20 and indicted on accusations they stole from hundreds of thousands of people who donated to the We Build the Wall campaign, a private effort to construct a barrier along the southern U.S. border. Prosecutors said the men routed the funds through shell companies and a nonprofit.<br />On his final day in office last month, Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Bannon as part of a flurry of pardons and commutations. The White House said Mr. Bannon “has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen.” That pardon applied only to alleged federal crimes, not state charges.<br />The investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., a Democrat, is in its early stages, the people said. It couldn’t be determined if Manhattan prosecutors were investigating the same circumstances that underpinned the federal investigation.<br />For local prosecutors to gain access to information presented to a federal grand jury, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York would have to request an order from a federal judge. There is no indication a judge has granted such an order."
