    "body": "WASHINGTON—Two Senate committees postponed scheduled votes on Neera Tanden’s nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget, raising further doubts that she can garner enough support to be confirmed by the chamber.<br />The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Budget Committee had been scheduled to vote Wednesday, but both panels delayed their votes as Democrats scrambled to save Ms. Tanden’s nomination, according to two people familiar with the matter.<br />As the news of the postponed votes emerged Wednesday morning, the White House defended Ms. Tanden amid criticism from some lawmakers over her past social-media posts.<br />“Neera Tanden is a leading policy expert who brings critical qualifications to the table during this time of unprecedented crisis,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki wrote on  Twitter .  “She also has important perspective and values, understanding firsthand the powerful difference policy can make in the lives of those going through hard times.”<br />Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, (I., Vt.) the chairman of the Budget Committee, called Ms. Tanden late Tuesday night to tell her about the postponement, one person familiar with the conversation said."
