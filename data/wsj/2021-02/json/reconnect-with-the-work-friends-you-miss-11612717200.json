    "body": "For four years, Jennifer Klein and Juline Chutuk saw each other every workday. They shouted back and forth between their offices at the Westlake Village, Calif., mortgage banker where they work, and talked through everything from breakups to glitches they were having with the company’s software system. They shared lunch, a  Costco  membership and a stab at a low-carb diet.<br />And then, one day in March, they went home.<br />“Getting to see her—that was one of the highlights of my day,” says Ms. Chutuk, 39. “It’s like losing your spouse.”<br />We’ve Zoomed and Slacked and figured out how to get our work done from home. But we still miss our work friends. A Pew Research Center survey of 10,332 adults in October found that 65% of workers who shifted to remote work because of the pandemic say they feel less connected to their colleagues now.<br />Some decided to just muscle through on their own during the chaotic spring months and are now finding it awkward to reconnect. Others started out by filling their calendars with virtual happy hours before realizing sharing a drink over a screen just wasn’t the same."
