    "body": "ViacomCBS Inc.  is planning to put some of the biggest movies from its Paramount film studio on its Paramount+ streaming service within two months of their theatrical release, Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish told investors Wednesday.<br />The announcement makes ViacomCBS the latest major media company to disrupt the traditional theatrical window, long a Hollywood staple, as the rise of streaming services like  Netflix Inc.  reshapes the exhibition industry.<br />Speaking at an investor presentation for Paramount+, Mr. Bakish said the streaming service would include a movie library with over 2,500 titles from the Paramount and Miramax movie studios. Every new Paramount movie would become available on the Paramount+ platform after appearing in theaters, he added.<br />“In short, if you love movies, Paramount+ is a streaming service that you can’t live without,” Mr. Bakish said.<br />ViacomCBS’s decision to shorten the theatrical window follows similar moves by rivals including  Walt Disney Co. ,  Comcast Corp.’s  NBCUniversal and  AT&T Inc.’s  WarnerMedia that are seeking to balance their lucrative theatrical exhibition businesses with the success of their own video-streaming services, which have become central to their owners’ corporate strategies."
