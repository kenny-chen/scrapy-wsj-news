    "body": "DoorDash Inc.  said it is acquiring robotics startup Chowbotics, signaling increased interest in automating food production when ordering in is at an all-time high.<br />The companies didn’t disclose the terms of the deal, which The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Monday. Chowbotics was valued at $46 million in 2018, when it last raised money, according to data firm PitchBook.<br />Chowbotics’ technology can whip up salads and poke bowls, among other things, and DoorDash is exploring how to deploy it across restaurants, a person familiar with the matter said. Ideas include using the technology to help restaurants expand their menu—such as enabling a pizzeria to offer salads—or to allow a salad bar to try out new locations—a kiosk at an airport, for instance—without the need for more manpower.<br />“We’re working on solutions to help merchants grow in an ever-challenging and changing landscape, and with Chowbotics we hope to enhance that level of support,” DoorDash said in a blog post announcing the acquisition. The company said Chowbotics had installed its meal-making robots in hundreds of locations, including universities, hospitals, and grocery stores.<br />While automating food production could save restaurants time and cost, it’s unclear how amenable potential diners are to these technologies."
