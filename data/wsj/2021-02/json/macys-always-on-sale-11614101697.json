    "body": "Macy’s  belongs to an endangered species in the world of retail. That comes with one benefit: Every sign of life can be enough to keep investors on board.<br />Macy’s did have a better holiday season than expected. Net sales were down 18.7% in the quarter ended Jan. 30 compared with a year earlier, better than the 22.6% decline that analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected. But that was still a steeper revenue decline than the 14.4% drop that department stores around the country experienced over the same period, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.<br />The retailer also benefited from fewer product returns compared with previous holiday seasons—thanks in large part to customers buying less clothes. Home, beauty, jewelry and watch categories were popular this holiday season.<br />Net income was a positive surprise, coming in at $160 million compared with the $14.3 million analysts expected. That was mostly thanks to greatly reduced operating expenses. The department store chain reduced operating costs by $900 million for the full year and expects to keep expenses at that depressed level going forward. For the full year, Macy’s incurred a net loss of $3.9 billion.<br />It is important to remember that behind Macy’s cost reductions are expectations that it will sell less going forward. Macy’s thinks fiscal 2021 net sales will be 15.5% lower than fiscal 2019 levels at the high end of its guidance. That’s not a high bar: Sales also declined in 2019."
