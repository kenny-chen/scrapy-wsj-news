    "body": "LOS ANGELES—The ending hasn’t been written yet, but Hollywood is moving quickly to bring the story of the  GameStop  investment saga to the screen.<br />Separate projects at  Netflix Inc.  and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. are already in development about the past week on Wall Street, in which an investing-focused group on a Reddit message board banded together to boost the share prices of struggling companies such as GameStop Corp. and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,  in the process crippling the hedge funds that had bet against them.<br />Netflix is in talks with screenwriter Mark Boal, who dramatized real-life events such as the Osama bin Laden raid in “Zero Dark Thirty,” for a movie that would include the streaming company’s breakout 24-year-old star, Noah Centineo, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />At MGM, executives are planning to develop a forthcoming manuscript by Ben Mezrich about the saga titled “The Antisocial Network.” The studio moved so fast that it acquired the rights to Mr. Mezrich’s book proposal, which is being shopped to publishers for purchase this month, according to a person familiar with the deal.<br />It isn’t a surprise that the week that wrecked Wall Street drew producers’ attention, given its colorful cast of characters and the dramatic success the amateur traders had in disrupting the best-laid plans of hedge-fund owners."
