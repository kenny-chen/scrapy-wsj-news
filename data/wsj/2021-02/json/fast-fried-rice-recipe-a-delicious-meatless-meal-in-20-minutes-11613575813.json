    "body": "WITH THIS RECIPE, Brandon Jew nods to Hokkien fried rice, a comforting classic topped with rich gravy. In the original, cornstarch thickens the sauce and prevents the rice from getting soggy. “The two remain distinct,” Mr. Jew said. He retains that trick here.<br />Otherwise, Mr. Jew brings his own spin to this fried rice, his second Slow Food Fast recipe. For instance, “I’ve never seen sunchokes in Chinese cooking,” he said. But the sweet, nutty root suits this dish very well.<br />Mr. Jew’s quick-cooking gravy gets deep umami flavor from mushroom stock, Shaoxing wine and white pepper. And the chef finishes with a nice textural flourish: a garnish of thinly shaved raw mushrooms. “Sunchokes and mushrooms are both so earthy,” he said. “They have a natural affinity for one another.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page."
