    "body": "The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Lev Parnas, a Florida businessman who helped Rudy Giuliani push for investigations in Ukraine to benefit former President Donald Trump, accusing him of duping investors in a fraud-insurance company.<br />In a civil complaint Thursday in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Mr. Parnas and his business partner, David Correia, violated laws governing the sales of securities in connection with the company, Fraud Guarantee.<br />Mr. Parnas, 48 years old, also faces criminal charges—including campaign-finance allegations and a fraud count related to Fraud Guarantee—brought by Manhattan federal prosecutors. Mr. Parnas has pleaded not guilty. The trial, which was supposed to begin in March, has been pushed back without a firm date.<br />The SEC’s allegations expand on those outlined by federal prosecutors, accusing Messrs. Correia and Parnas of raising more than $2 million from investors for Fraud Guarantee, which they used to pay for “lavish personal expenses” unrelated to the company.<br />Fraud Guarantee billed itself as a company that developed products to help customers recover losses from investment or consumer fraud. The company never became operational and never sold any products, according to court filings."
