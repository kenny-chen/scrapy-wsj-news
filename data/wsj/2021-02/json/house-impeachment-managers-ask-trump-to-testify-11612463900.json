    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former President Donald Trump spurned a request from House impeachment managers that he testify next week as part of the Senate trial on a charge that he incited an insurrection last month at the U.S. Capitol.<br />“Two days ago you filed an answer in which you denied many factual allegations set forth in the article of impeachment,” wrote Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.) in a letter. “You have thus attempted to put critical facts at issue notwithstanding the clear and overwhelming evidence of your constitutional offense.”<br />“In light of your disputing these factual allegations, I write to invite you to provide testimony under oath,” added Mr. Raskin, the lead impeachment manager.<br />Trump adviser Jason Miller said Thursday that “the president will not testify in an unconstitutional proceeding.”<br />In a letter to Mr. Raskin, Trump lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen called the invitation to testify a “public relations stunt.”"
