    "body": "Thousands of miles from Wall Street, the boom in blank-check companies is taking hold in a region where major stock exchanges don’t let firms raise money for unspecified uses.<br />In mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore, investment firms controlled by tycoons and money managers have collectively raised billions of dollars on the New York Stock Exchange and  Nasdaq  Stock Market over the past year via special-purpose acquisition vehicles, showing how far-reaching the SPAC boom has been.<br />The vehicles are publicly listed shell companies with ready pools of cash to invest in—and merge with—private businesses. They have been touted by investment bankers as an easier way for startups to go public. If a SPAC fails to find a merger target by a deadline, typically two years, investors could take their money back.<br />As of Feb. 18, eight SPACs sponsored by companies in Asia raised a total of $2.3 billion this year, according to Dealogic data. The sum is small relative to what has been raised by American companies, but it already surpassed the total raised from SPACs in the region for all of 2020. Bankers say more issuances are likely, including from private-equity groups.<br />“This is a compelling pocket of capital that all the large private-equity and venture firms in Asia will be considering,” said Udhay Furtado, co-head of Asia equity capital markets at  Citigroup Inc."
