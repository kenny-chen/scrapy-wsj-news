    "body": "WASHINGTON—The dramatic conclusion of former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial laid bare deep philosophical rifts between Republicans, as GOP senators splintered not only over the question of Mr. Trump’s guilt, but also the future of their party and Mr. Trump’s role in it.<br />Seven GOP senators voted to convict the former president of inciting an insurrection on Jan. 6—not enough to find him guilty but, as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer pointed out, the final tally was the most guilty votes cast by members of a president’s own party in any impeachment trial in American history.<br />The rest of the Senate Republican conference—43 senators in total—voted to acquit Mr. Trump, but not without some angst, reflecting a party schism that also has fractured the House and will likely play out in primary elections in 2022 and 2024.<br />“It’s been a tough day,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.), who voted to acquit.<br />Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican, said as he left the Capitol: “It’s an uncomfortable vote and time will tell, but…I don’t think there was a good outcome there for anybody.” Mr. Thune also voted to acquit Mr. Trump."
