    "body": "Beyond Meat Inc.  said it struck deals to supply plant-based meat imitations to  McDonald’s ,  KFC and Pizza Hut, a victory in the company’s effort to take meat alternatives into the American dining mainstream.<br />Under separate agreements announced Thursday, California-based Beyond said it would be the preferred supplier for a new plant-based burger from McDonald’s Corp., while helping develop new plant-based menu items for  Yum Brands Inc.  chains KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.<br />The deals boost Beyond’s prospects as more restaurants resume in-person dining, after Covid-19 forced shutdowns and restrictions on eating out over the past year. The pandemic’s blow to the food-service industry hurt Beyond’s business, which had been heavily propelled by restaurants in recent years, and prompted the company to focus more on supermarket sales.<br />Beyond reported Thursday a $25.1 million loss for 2020’s fourth quarter, as restaurant orders remained sluggish.<br />“They are the biggest deals you could possibly put together in food,” said Ethan Brown, Beyond Meat’s chief executive and founder, of the new agreements with McDonald’s and Yum."
