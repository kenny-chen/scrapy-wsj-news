    "body": "Warehouses and distribution centers for online retail have been the recent stars of the commercial property market. Then there’s Houston.<br />A building surge for such facilities in the Texas city over the past three years is driving vacancies up and rents down. About 8.5 million square feet of new space for warehouses, distribution hubs and fulfillment centers was delivered in the fourth quarter of last year, about double the amount in the same quarter of 2019, according to  Colliers International .<br />Vacancies jumped to 8.8% from 6.6% during the past year, Colliers said in a fourth-quarter 2020 report. Asking rents for Houston warehouse and distribution space was $7.36 a square foot in the fourth quarter, down from $7.43 in the previous quarter, according to the report.<br />New firms such as NorthPoint Development in the Kansas City, Mo., area and Dallas’s Holt Lunsford Commercial Investments have been rushing into the Houston market, armed with cash that has been flooding into the industrial sector.<br />The boom in e-commerce has generated tremendous demand for places to store products before they are shipped out to customers. Online shopping volume had been growing at 15% annually up until the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the data analytics firm Green Street. Last year it increased by about 35%, Green Street said."
