    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House plans to hold a meeting with lawmakers Wednesday to discuss supply chain issues, including a global chip shortage that is hurting U.S. auto makers, according to two people familiar with the plans.<br />President Biden has made supply chain problems a priority and the White House has said an executive order is imminent. The administration has been holding meetings with auto companies and suppliers.<br />The White House didn’t comment Tuesday.<br />A White House official previously said the administration had asked embassies to identify ways foreign countries and companies could help address the chip shortage. Among those involved are Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, and Brian Deese, Mr. Biden’s top economic adviser.<br />The official said a broad review is under way to look at critical supply chains “to identify vulnerabilities and take steps, such as spurring increased U.S. domestic production, to address gaps over the long term and support good paying jobs.”"
