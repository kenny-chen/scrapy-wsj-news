    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Democrats began preparing a back-up plan Friday for raising the minimum wage at some large companies as part of their coronavirus relief package, after the chamber’s parliamentarian ruled out including a broader increase.<br />Backed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), two committee chairmen are working on a new, more limited proposal that would use the tax system to prod employers to raise wages.<br />The plan would impose tax penalties on large companies that aren’t paying the higher wage Democrats seek and create tax incentives for small companies to do so. Democrats hope the chamber’s parliamentarian would allow them to include the modified plan in the coronavirus relief package.<br />The tax plan is being developed by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), and they haven’t finalized the details.<br />Mr. Wyden said Friday the proposal would impose a 5% penalty on the total payroll of a large corporation if it pays any workers below a certain amount, which he didn’t specify, with the penalty increasing over time. The plan would also provide small businesses that pay their employees higher wages with an income tax credit equal to 25% of wages, capped at $10,000 per employer a year."
