    "body": "PARIS—A French investigative judge has brought preliminary charges of rape and sexual assault against Gérard Depardieu, an actor once regarded as the face of French cinema.<br />The judge filed the charges in December, alleging Mr. Depardieu raped an actress in the summer of 2018, a French judicial official said Wednesday. The actress, a woman in her 20s, hasn’t been identified.<br />Under the French legal system, the filing of preliminary charges indicates that the investigating judge believes there is enough evidence against Mr. Depardieu for authorities to deepen their investigation of the accusations. The judge could then decide to drop the charges or order him to stand trial.<br />“Mr. Depardieu is and remains presumed innocent,” said the actor’s lawyer Hervé Temime. “He strongly contests the accusations against him.”<br />The actress brought a complaint against Mr. Depardieu, 72-years-old, in August 2018, saying he sexually assaulted and raped her on two occasions earlier that month at his house in the upscale 6th arrondissement of Paris."
