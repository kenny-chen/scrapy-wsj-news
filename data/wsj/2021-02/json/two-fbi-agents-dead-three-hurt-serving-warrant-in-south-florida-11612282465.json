    "body": "MIAMI—Two FBI agents were killed and three others wounded in a shooting while serving a warrant in South Florida Tuesday morning, the bureau said.<br />The agents were part of a team of law-enforcement officers executing a federal-search warrant in a crimes-against-children case in the city of Sunrise. Officials said they were aiming to seize evidence in a child pornography investigation.<br />As they executed the warrant just after 6 a.m. at an apartment complex, the suspect began shooting and then barricaded himself inside the complex, a Sunrise city spokeswoman said. Officials said the gunman is also dead.<br />FBI Director Christopher Wray identified the agents who were fatally shot as Special Agent Daniel Alfin and Special Agent Laura Schwartzenberger, whom he said “exemplified heroism today in defense of their country.”<br />“The FBI will always honor their ultimate sacrifice and will be forever grateful for their bravery,” Mr. Wray said."
