    "body": "Jason Riley’s “Progressives Put the Racial ‘Equity’ Squeeze on Biden” (Upward Mobility, Feb. 3) touches on the importance of controlling the narrative. The “E-word” used to stand for equality. But over the last few years diversity, equality and inclusion initiatives now speak to equity. Why the difference? As Mr. Riley states, equality can be interpreted as equal opportunity, while equity can assume an equal outcome, that a society’s wealth is owned in common and not primarily by those who create it. Equity means everyone has an equal share of the pie regardless of the contribution.<br />The word equality has now been tacitly banned; it will soon be labeled a construct of white privilege intended to coerce people to hard work. But it’s hard to unlearn the old narrative. Mr. Riley quotes the president as saying: “this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equity.” But listen to the audio. The president starts to say “racial equality” but catches himself in midword. He says: “racial equali . . . equity.” The old dog hasn’t fully learned the new trick. His trainers will make sure he does.<br />Fred Van Bennekom<br />Bolton, Mass.<br />"
