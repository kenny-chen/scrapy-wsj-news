    "body": "SÃO PAULO—Oil giant  Petrobras  lost almost a fifth of its market value Monday after Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro named an army general to take over the company in an apparent bid to control fuel prices, sparking a crisis of confidence in his administration’s commitment to free-market policies.<br />Mr. Bolsonaro’s plans to appoint Joaquim Silva e Luna, who served alongside the president decades ago under Brazil’s military dictatorship, came as a blow to the oil producer, which was recently pushed to the brink of bankruptcy through government intervention. The appointment must still be approved by the state-controlled company’s board at a meeting scheduled for Feb. 23.<br />Shares in Petrobras fell nearly 20% in late afternoon trading on Monday, and the Bovespa index fell more than 4%, with the Brazilian real sliding more than 1% against the dollar.<br />“It’s a complete disaster,” said Mailson da Nóbrega, a Brazilian economist and former finance minister.<br />He said Mr. Bolsonaro is increasingly ruling like a populist by intervening in Latin America’s largest company. “This creates insecurity about other areas of the government...it’s going to take a long time for us to come back from this,” he added."
