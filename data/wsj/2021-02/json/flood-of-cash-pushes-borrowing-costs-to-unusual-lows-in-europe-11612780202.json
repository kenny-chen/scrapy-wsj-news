    "body": "Too much money chasing too few assets is creating some strange phenomena at the heart of European financial markets.<br />One stark example: Some companies and most banks can now borrow at rates that are lower—and further below zero—than the rate set by the European Central Bank.<br />Italy’s  Enel  SpA, one of Europe’s biggest electricity producers, has short-term commercial paper that recently offered an annualized yield of minus 0.61%, according to FactSet: That is 0.11 percentage point lower than the ECB’s deposit rate of minus 0.5%.<br />When interest rates are negative, borrowers pay back less than they were lent when their debt comes due. At Enel’s rate, if it borrowed $100 for a year, it would pay back $99.39.<br />For the lender, in this case the money-market funds that buy commercial paper, the opposite is true. They get back less money."
