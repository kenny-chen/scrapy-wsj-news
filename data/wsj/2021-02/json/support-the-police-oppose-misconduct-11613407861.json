    "body": "Columbus, Ohio<br />America is divided over supporting the police or the communities they serve. But it isn’t an either-or choice.<br />As Ohio’s attorney general, I support police. I’ve spoken at police memorials and Back the Blue rallies, been on too many crime scenes, and seen firsthand their phenomenal, selfless service. That’s why I asked a grand jury to indict a cop for murder.<br />On Dec. 22 Columbus Police Officer Adam Coy responded to a report of a man outside a home, periodically turning his sport-utility vehicle on and off. Mr. Coy approached the man, Andre Hill, who explained he was waiting to pick someone up.<br />Mr. Coy disbelieved Hill and stayed. After a second officer arrived, Mr. Coy approached Hill, who was inside the open garage door of the house. He ordered Hill out of the garage. Hill complied, holding up a lit cellphone displaying a text message. Mr. Coy suddenly shouted “Gun!” and shot Hill four times, killing him."
