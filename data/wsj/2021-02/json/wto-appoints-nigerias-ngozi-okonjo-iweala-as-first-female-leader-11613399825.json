    "body": "The World Trade Organization picked its first female leader on Monday, offering a fresh start to an organization seeking to revive its influence over global economic rules.<br />The WTO’s 164 members unanimously backed former Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, an economist who also rose to the top ranks of the World Bank a decade ago, as director-general.<br />Ms. Okonjo-Iweala emerged as the consensus pick for the job in October when the WTO was due to decide on a new leader. However, her appointment was blocked by the Trump administration, which said she lacked experience on trade issues.<br />Earlier this month, shortly after South Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-Hee pulled out of the race, the Biden administration backed Ms. Okonjo-Iweala. She will be the WTO’s first African leader and her term, which starts March 1, will end in August 2025 unless renewed.<br />“The challenges facing the WTO are numerous and tricky, but they are not insurmountable,” Ms. Okonjo-Iweala said after being appointed. “There is light at the end of the tunnel if we work together in a transparent manner that builds trust.”"
