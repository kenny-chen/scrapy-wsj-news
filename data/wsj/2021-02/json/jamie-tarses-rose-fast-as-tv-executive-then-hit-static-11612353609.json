    "body": "Jamie Tarses came to prominence in the 1990s as a wunderkind programming executive at NBC where she helped develop hits such as “Friends” and “Mad About You.”<br />She was so successful that in 1996 rival ABC recruited her to be the first female head of entertainment for a big three broadcast network. But she lasted barely three years there amid clashes and second-guessing from her bosses.<br />Ms. Tarses, who died Monday at the age of 56 in Los Angeles of what her family called complications from a cardiac event, left a complex legacy. She went from a creative genius reshaping prime time television to a cautionary tale of the executive who rose too fast and burned too many bridges along the way.<br />Just 32 when she joined ABC, Ms. Tarses was one of the youngest and the first woman to hold such a powerful position. With that came scrutiny and second-guessing from an industry that thrives on schadenfreude.<br />Less than a year into the job, Ms. Tarses’ eventual departure was already the subject of intense speculation, so much so that she once began a presentation to advertisers at Radio City Music Hall by saying, “What, you were expecting someone else?”"
