    "body": "SEOUL—Late last year, South Korea’s prime minister called a homegrown antibody treatment that was nearing completion “a ray of light,” while the chairman of the pharmaceutical firm that was developing it boasted the medication could make the country free of Covid-19 by the spring.<br />But on Friday, even as South Korea’s drug regulators granted fast-track approval to  Celltrion Inc.’s  monoclonal antibody treatment, hopes that it could be an immediate game-changer have diminished.<br />The introduction of the new treatment was met with skepticism as previously approved antibody drugs have had limited impacts on aiding recoveries from Covid-19 before vaccines become readily available.<br />“We are hoping the treatment will lighten the burden of hospitalizing patients with serious symptoms,” said Kim Gang-lip, the country’s top drug-approval official. “It’s difficult to say how much [the treatment] will help in containing a surge.”<br />Celltrion’s drug, dubbed Regkirona, is intended for use with patients who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 and relies on lab-engineered versions of antibodies that simulate the body’s natural immune response to viruses. The class of therapies attracted attention after former President Donald Trump said a monoclonal antibodies drug helped him achieve a speedy recovery."
