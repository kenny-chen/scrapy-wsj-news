It previously contributed to Project Involve and Ghetto Film School, nonprofit organizations that provide fellowships and mentoring to filmmakers from diverse backgrounds.<br />The fund is the latest of several initiatives Netflix has launched that are aimed at boosting diversity in entertainment. Last year, the company said it would donate $5 million to organizations supporting Black artists, advocacy groups and businesses.<br />“Doing better means establishing even more opportunities for people from underrepresented communities to have their voices heard, and purposefully closing capacity and skill gaps with training programs where they are needed,” said Netflix Co-Chief Executive and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos in a company blog post Friday."
