    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. federal budget deficit widened sharply last month, the Congressional Budget Office said, as the latest coronavirus-relief package from Congress sent direct stimulus payments to millions of Americans.<br />The monthly deficit widened to an estimated $165 billion in January, compared with $33 billion in January 2020 and $144 billion in December, the nonpartisan CBO estimated on Monday.<br />For the first four months of the 2021 fiscal year—which started Oct. 1—the federal budget deficit rose 90% to $738 billion, the CBO added.<br />Federal spending surged in January as elements of the $900 billion aid package signed into law at the end of 2020 began taking effect. Among the costliest provisions was $142 billion in stimulus checks paid out in January and $25 billion in rental-assistance grants to state and local governments.<br />Spending on unemployment benefits, which received a top-up in the legislation, rose to $34 billion last month from $28 billion in December and $3 billion in January 2020, before the pandemic struck the U.S. economy."
