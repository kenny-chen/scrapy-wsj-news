    "body": "Rolling Stone magazine is launching a video channel on Twitch, a move that makes the famed music and pop culture magazine the first mainstream publication to build a presence on  Amazon Inc.’s  live-video streaming service.<br />The service, to be called “Rolling Stone on Twitch,” will go live March 1, and will broadcast for several hours a day, five days a week, said Gus Wenner, Rolling Stone’s president and chief operating officer, in an interview.<br />The deal helps Rolling Stone, which was founded in 1967 and built its success covering the biggest rock stars of the baby boomer generation, in its efforts to appeal to younger audiences and deepen its position in the digital media space. It also helps Twitch, a platform mostly used by videogame enthusiasts, to broaden its reach.<br />Programming will feature intimate live performances from established and up-and-coming musicians, Mr. Wenner said. The channel will also air interviews of musicians by other musicians, shows detailing how famous songs came to be and news programming focused on music and culture.<br />The channel will primarily focus on selling advertising and sponsorships for its programs to finance operations, Mr. Wenner said. Rolling Stone has built a studio inside its Manhattan offices to use for the channel, although much of the content in its early days will rely on remote feeds from artists’ homes due to Covid-19 restrictions."
