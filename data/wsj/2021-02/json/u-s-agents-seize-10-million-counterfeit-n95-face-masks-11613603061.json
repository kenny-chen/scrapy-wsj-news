    "body": "WASHINGTON—Federal agents have seized approximately 10 million counterfeit N95 face masks bearing the  3M Co.  logo in recent weeks, officials said Wednesday, as they urged thousands of hospitals and medical facilities to stop using suspected fakes.<br />The Department of Homeland Security said the counterfeit masks were made in China. The most recent interdiction occurred Wednesday, with the seizure of hundreds of thousands of masks from an East Coast warehouse at an undisclosed location.<br />Acting on leads from 3M, DHS officials said they have seized counterfeit items in five states and have opened criminal investigations.<br />“They are extremely dangerous,” Steve Francis, director of the Intellectual Property Center for DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations unit said at a news conference. “They are providing a false sense of security to our first-line responders and to the American consumers.”<br />Officials said grammatical errors or typos on packaging or user instructions are telltale signs of counterfeit items. They said they have contacted about 6,000 hospitals, clinics and others who may have purchased counterfeit masks, urging them to stop using the masks and contact DHS immediately."
