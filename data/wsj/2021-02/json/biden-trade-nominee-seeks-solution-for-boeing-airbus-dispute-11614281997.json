    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s pick for U.S. Trade Representative said she would accelerate negotiations with the European Union to resolve a longstanding dispute over commercial-aircraft subsidies, citing the fight’s negative impact across several industries.<br />Speaking at her confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee, Katherine Tai, a veteran government trade lawyer, said the 16-year-old dispute over how governments subsidize  Boeing Co.  and  Airbus SE  has led to counter-tariffs—sanctioned by the World Trade Organization—on food and beverage products, causing “disruption” and “pain.”<br />“At the core of this…is the need for the U.S. and the EU to come together to figure out an answer,” Ms. Tai said. “I would very much be interested in figuring out how to land this particular plane because it has been going on for a very long time.”<br />Restaurant and beverage industries have been pushing for a solution to the aircraft dispute, which has heaped pressure on businesses already struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic. The Trump administration imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European wine and food items such as cheese and olives in late 2019. The EU hit back with levies on U.S. whiskey, nuts and tobacco.<br />The EU’s trade commissioner, Vladis Dombrovskis, called for a mutual suspension of tariffs in the aircraft dispute this month."
