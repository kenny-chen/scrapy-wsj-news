    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department on Monday dropped its challenge of California’s net-neutrality law, in what may signal a shift back to an Obama-era policy aimed at equal access to the internet.<br />The Federal Communications Commission’s acting chairwoman applauded the Justice Department decision, which was conveyed through a one-sentence notice in federal district court in California that the case was being dismissed.<br />“By taking this step, Washington is listening to the American people, who overwhelmingly support an open internet, and is charting a course to once again make net neutrality the law of the land,” said Jessica Rosenworcel, who was designated as the FCC’s interim leader by President Biden.<br />Net-neutrality rules are aimed at preventing internet providers—mostly cable and phone companies—from favoring some internet content over others, for instance through higher speeds.<br />Reinstating the Obama-era rules has taken on added importance for some advocates since the Covid pandemic, because the regulations, which treated carriers like utilities, could help form the basis for addressing broadband affordability problems, for instance through eventual rate regulation of the service."
