    "body": "A busy start to the year in bond trading has led to record volatility at electronic marketplaces.<br />Average daily trading volume on  Tradeweb Markets Inc.’s  online bond-trading platform topped $1 trillion in January, the company said Thursday. That marks the busiest month on record, beating March 2020 when plunging stock markets pushed investors into the relative safety of government debt. Tradeweb is one of the largest electronic marketplaces for Treasurys.<br />Other firms are also seeing a surge in trading. On Tuesday, competitor  MarketAxess Holdings Inc.  reported average daily trading volume on its online credit trading platform at a record $12.4 billion in January, exceeding last March.<br />The pickup in trading volumes is notable because it follows a banner year for electronic bond-trading platforms. Tradeweb and MarketAxess both experienced the highest yearly trading volumes ever in 2020, helping each company gain market share and post record revenue.<br />“We have so many of our clients still working remotely. This behavioral change has been an accelerant for the move to an electronic trading environment in fixed income,” said Lee Olesky, Tradeweb’s chief executive."
