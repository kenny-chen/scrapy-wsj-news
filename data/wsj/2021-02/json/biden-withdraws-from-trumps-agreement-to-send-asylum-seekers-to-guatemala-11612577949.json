    "body": "President Biden has withdrawn from a Trump administration agreement with Guatemala to send asylum seekers to the Central American country, the Guatemalan government said Friday.<br />The pact, signed by the Trump administration in July 2019, allowed the U.S. government to send asylum seekers at the southern border to Guatemala, where they were told to ask for humanitarian protection instead.<br />The State Department didn’t return a request for comment.<br />The Trump administration said at the time that asylum seekers—many of whom pass through more than one country before reaching the U.S. border—should first try to make claims for protection in those countries.<br />The Trump administration signed similar agreements with El Salvador and Honduras later in 2019 as part of its strategy to enlist Mexico and Central American countries in sharing the burden of migrants across the region."
