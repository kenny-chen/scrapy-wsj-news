    "body": "The Biden administration and South Korea are closing in on an agreement that would resolve a yearslong dispute over how to share the cost of American troops based on the Korean Peninsula, U.S. and South Korean officials say.<br />Headway in the talks between Seoul and Washington comes as the U.S. reached a parallel accord earlier this month with Japan that would extend that burden-sharing arrangement for a year.<br />The twin diplomatic moves are part of a broader push by the Biden administration to solidify ties with important allies, put aside the Trump administration’s transactional approach and settle disputes that have long roiled relations with Washington.<br />“It would certainly put an irritant behind us, which is not insignificant,” said Randall Schriver, who served as a senior Pentagon official for Asia during the Trump administration.<br />At issue in the South Korean negotiation is the approximately $2 billion cost of maintaining nearly 30,000 U.S. troops, of which Seoul now pays nearly half."
