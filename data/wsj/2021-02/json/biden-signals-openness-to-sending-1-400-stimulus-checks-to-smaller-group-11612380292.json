    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden indicated in a call with House Democrats that he was open to sending $1,400 payments to a smaller group of Americans in the next round of coronavirus relief legislation and changing the overall price tag of his $1.9 trillion plan, according to people familiar with the call.<br />Mr. Biden told House Democrats on Wednesday that he wouldn’t change the amount of the proposed $1,400 payments, saying people had been promised that amount, according to the people.<br />Instead, he said he would consider targeting them differently than the previous two rounds of direct aid to Americans. Members of both political parties have questioned whether the $1,400 payments he has proposed would go to people who don’t need the aid.<br />“We can better target that number. I’m OK with that,” Mr. Biden said, according to the people.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki said later Wednesday that Mr. Biden is open to changes in the threshold for who would qualify for the $1,400 stimulus checks.”That’s something that has been under discussion,” she said."
