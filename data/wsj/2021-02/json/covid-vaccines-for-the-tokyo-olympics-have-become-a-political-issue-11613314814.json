    "body": "The International Olympic Committee has a complicated view of whether athletes should be vaccinated for this summer’s Tokyo Games.<br />The IOC won’t require Covid-19 vaccines for competition, and doesn’t want athletes to cut the line. But it’s also directed national Olympic committees to try to get shots for their athletes.<br />The conflicting signals show what a touchy topic the vaccine has become ahead of Tokyo. Even discussing shots for athletes can provoke hostility as a slow vaccine rollout proceeds around the world among countries eager to turn the tide of deaths, case numbers and economic downturn. Yet sports officials in dominant Olympic nations say they’re pursuing the IOC’s request anyway.<br />Meanwhile, a longtime IOC member asserted in strong terms the importance of vaccines to the countries participating in the Tokyo Games, now just five months away.<br />“Unless you’re out of your f—ing mind, you should get vaccinated before you come,” said Dick Pound, in a recent interview with the Journal."
