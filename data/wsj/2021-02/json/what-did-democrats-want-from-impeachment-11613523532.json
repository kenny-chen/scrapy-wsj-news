    "body": "In the space of less than 72 hours, congressional Democrats called for witnesses to be heard in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, then agreed not to interview witnesses and conclude the trial on Saturday, then announced on Monday a new investigation to include witness interviews. What exactly are they trying to accomplish?<br />The Journal’s Alex Leary reports on the current position that more investigation is needed:<br />Getting to the truth is surely a laudable goal, even if Saturday’s action  in the Senate made one wonder whether truth-seeking was really the priority. Burgess Everett, Heather Caygle and Marianne Levine reported in Politico on what happened after senators agreed to call witnesses:<br />Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night could stay lawmakers from their solemn impeachment duty. But observance of a marginal unofficial holiday seems to have done the trick.<br />Whether or not one believes in a senatorial duty to honor the sanctity  of Valentine’s Day, James Downie of the Washington Post argued on Sunday that it’s a little early for Congress to be demanding time off. “Less than a full month into Joe Biden’s presidency, Congress is already entering a week in recess,” noted Mr. Downie."
