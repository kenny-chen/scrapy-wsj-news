    "body": "The mortgage market just had a record year. The mortgage IPO boom, though, is petering out.<br />Last year was a banner season for the IPO market in general and public offerings for mortgage companies in particular. Between July and December, eight of the 30 largest U.S. mortgage lenders announced plans to go public.<br />It hasn’t worked out quite the way all the companies were hoping. Two lenders that have gone public this year,  Home Point Capital Inc.  and  loanDepot Inc.,  considerably scaled back their offerings. Another lender, AmeriHome Mortgage, abandoned its IPO plans and instead said it would sell to a bank. Shares of Caliber Home Loans Inc., which were expected to list in October, have yet to hit the public market.<br />“The average investor is not convinced a mortgage company is a great bet as far as owning stock in it,” said Guy Cecala, chief executive of Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research firm. “It’s a cyclical business, and they’re not sure what’s going to happen.”<br />With home prices soaring, many families are getting locked out of home buying—and some buyers who rushed in are regretting they did. Some of the borrowers who have been allowed to pause their mortgage payments during the pandemic will struggle to get back on track when their relief programs end. And slightly higher mortgage rates have weighed on refinance and purchase activity in recent weeks."
