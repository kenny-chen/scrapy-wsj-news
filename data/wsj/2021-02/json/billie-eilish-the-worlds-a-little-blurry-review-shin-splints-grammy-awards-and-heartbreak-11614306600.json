    "body": "<br />Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry<br />Friday, AppleTV+<br />If there’s one takeaway from stories about pop superstars, it’s that, usually, fame messes people up. Under intense pressure from fans—and record labels—child stars from Britney Spears to Justin Bieber have appeared to self-destruct. The question that hangs over “Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry” (Friday, AppleTV+) is whether this wildly successful teenager will be any different. And it’s a particularly tricky case because Ms. Eilish has staked her reputation on her immense emotional vulnerability.<br />She first rose to prominence when the song “Ocean Eyes” (2015), recorded when she was just 13 years old, went viral. After that she released an EP, “Don’t Smile at Me” (2017), and went on tour in North America and Europe. The bulk of the film takes place between her 17th and 18th birthdays. When we meet her, Ms. Eilish is writing her first full-length album, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” (2019). By the end of the documentary, she will have won five Grammy Awards, including a sweep of the four major categories."
