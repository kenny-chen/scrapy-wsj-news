    "body": "Former  Boeing Co.  Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, about a year after his ouster from the aerospace giant, is taking steps to re-enter American business with a special-purpose acquisition company.<br />Mr. Muilenburg plans to raise $200 million for a SPAC seeking to merge with a private company in industries spanning space, defense, communications, advanced air mobility and logistics, according to a securities filing Monday.<br />The filing said Mr. Muilenburg was the CEO and chairman of New Vista Acquisition Corp., incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The company’s directors and advisers would include former Boeing executives as well as former officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. Air Force, according to the filing.<br />SPACs have become a popular source of financing for private companies looking to go public. Many analysts call SPACs “blank-check companies” because the investors backing them put up their money before an acquisition target is identified. A SPAC uses the proceeds to make an acquisition—usually within a couple of years—at which point the acquired company gets the SPAC’s spot on a stock exchange.<br />SPAC founders often earn several times their initial investment, thanks to unique incentives."
