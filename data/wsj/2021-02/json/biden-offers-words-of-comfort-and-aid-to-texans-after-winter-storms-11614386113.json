    "body": "HOUSTON—President Biden used a visit to Houston to reassure Texans struggling with the twin crises of recent winter storms and the coronavirus pandemic, saying Friday he would help the state “recover and rebuild.”<br />“Our fellow Americans are hurting and it’s our job to help everyone in need,” said Mr. Biden, speaking outside NRG Stadium, where the Houston Texans football team plays.<br />On one of his first trips as president, Mr. Biden took in a state still mired in crisis. The Arctic freeze that hit Texas earlier this month, bringing with it temperatures in the single digits, left millions of homes without power. Some people didn’t have electricity for days, suffering through the ice-cold temperatures without heat and, in some cases, running water. Residents, businesses and cities now face soaring power bills.<br />Mr. Biden visited an emergency operations center and a food bank. He was accompanied by first lady Jill Biden and a small group of aides.<br />Ahead of his remarks, Mr. Biden and Dr. Biden greeted workers at a drive-through Covid-19 vaccination site, which gives thousands of people shots every day. The site was shut down for 15 minutes for security reasons during the president’s appearance, the White House said."
