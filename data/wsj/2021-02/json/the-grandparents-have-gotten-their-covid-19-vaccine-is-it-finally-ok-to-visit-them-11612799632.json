But vaccination doesn’t eliminate risk—to grandparents or to their visitors—so it’s a good idea to assess your circumstances, continue to take some precautions and make sure everyone is comfortable with the terms of the visit.<br />The details<br />The virus that causes Covid-19 continues to mutate, raising the prospect that certain variants may make the vaccines less effective. And it’s not yet clear how much protection vaccines offer against transmission of the virus—so it may be possible for grandparents to spread Covid-19 to their visitors even if the vaccine keeps them from getting sick themselves."
