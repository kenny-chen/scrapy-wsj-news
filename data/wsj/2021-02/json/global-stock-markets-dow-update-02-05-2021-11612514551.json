    "body": "U.S. stock futures rose Friday, suggesting the S&P 500 is poised for its best week in three months, on investors’ bets that a fresh coronavirus-relief spending package will bolster the economy.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 climbed 0.4%, indicating that the broad market gauge may continue to rise after closing at a record high on Thursday. The benchmark is up over 4% this week, on track for its biggest one-week gain since the week ending Nov. 6.<br />Contracts linked to the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 advanced 0.3%, and those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.4% higher.<br />The market has rallied this week as President Biden pushed ahead with efforts to pass a $1.9 trillion relief package. Democrats are using a special procedure to move ahead on the stimulus bill: The Senate on Friday approved a budget plan that advances the reconciliation process necessary to get the aid plan approved with a simple majority in the Senate.<br />The fresh spending is viewed by many investors as crucial for shoring up the economy, with coronavirus cases still high across parts of the U.S."
