    "body": "Presenting their case for conviction at the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, the House managers repeatedly invoked Mr. Trump’s threat to “our democracy.” However remote the chance of conviction, Mr. Trump’s role in the Capitol riot is passing into the judgment of history, which likely will be severe. After a lifetime of playing with fire, Mr. Trump on Jan. 6 got too close to the flames, which will engulf his legacy.<br />But for Democrats, obloquy on even this historic scale is not enough for anyone who, as they say, “threatens our democracy.”<br />I’ve become fascinated with this phrase—“our democracy.” What exactly does it mean?<br />Not long ago, hardly anyone used the apocalyptic notion of a threat to “our democracy” as a political argument. Suddenly, it emerged among progressives as a routine term of political art. The word “our” implies another of progressivism’s modern virtues, inclusion. But that, as they themselves would say, is a false narrative.<br />When progressives refer to “our democracy,” what they mean is their democracy. To be a member of their democracy, one has to share their beliefs. If you’re not in, you’re out. And if you’re out, they may come after you for being a threat to democracy. Other than carbon emissions, what could be worse?"
