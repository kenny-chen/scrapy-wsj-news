    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said she sees no imminent pullback in central bank support as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The Fed will use all available tools to help the economy navigate its way out of the pandemic, Ms. Mester said in a virtual appearance on Monday, adding that when it comes to reducing the level of support, “that’s not going to be soon at all. I think we are going to be accommodative for a very long time because the economy needs it to get back on its feet.”"
