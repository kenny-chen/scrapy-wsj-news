    "body": "It is quiet in foreign-exchange markets. Maybe too quiet.<br />All the action has been in stocks this year, as any bored foreign-exchange trader will tell you. The market is usually a hub for raucous retail trading but has been largely quiescent during the meme-stock phenomenon.<br />The risk of a rise in currency volatility is something worth considering for investors with overseas exposure, as well as for corporate treasurers.<br />Stocks are usually more volatile than currencies. But the gulf between the Cboe Volatility Index—the familiar VIX “fear gauge” that measures the volatility of S&P 500 options—and the Cboe EuroCurrency Volatility Index, which does the same for euro-dollar options, is large by the standards of recent history. The same is true for volatility in other currency pairs.<br />The trend is relatively new. For most of the past decade, equity-market and currency volatility ground lower and lower in tandem, with occasional concurrent spikes. But after markets began to recover from last year’s pandemic-induced selloff, the relationship was disrupted: Foreign-exchange volatility resumed its decline, but equity-market volatility settled at a higher plateau."
