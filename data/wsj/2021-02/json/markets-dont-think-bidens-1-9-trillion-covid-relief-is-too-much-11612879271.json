    "body": "A trillion here, a trillion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money. A fierce argument has erupted between well-known left-leaning economists about President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package, with warnings that it is so large it risks runaway inflation and the crowding out of other, more productive, spending plans.<br />The concerns being voiced by Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary to Bill Clinton and director of Barack Obama’s National Economic Council, and Olivier Blanchard, former IMF chief economist, are perfectly reasonable arguments. After all, it comes just weeks after a $900 billion stimulus by the departing president.<br />Yet, markets show no sign of concern, either in the average expectation of inflation implied by the bond market or the likelihood of very high inflation in the options market, both of which are merely back to where they stood in 2018.<br />Investors are predicting the sort of inflation they like, slightly higher in the next few years but moderating back down after that, and it’s helping stocks and commodities while limiting the pain to bondholders from rising yields.<br />Investors have four reasons to take comfort that are at least as good as Messrs. Summers and Blanchard’s reasons for concern."
