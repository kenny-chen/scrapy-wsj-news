    "body": "Most of the nearly 200 people charged in federal cases in connection with the Capitol riot have no known ties to far-right groups, underscoring the challenge of heading off violent extremism, a Wall Street Journal review found.<br />Authorities say they are ramping up efforts to counter extremism in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, but they are discovering that any charges against people affiliated with organized groups such as the Proud Boys addresses only part of the issue.<br />According to the Journal’s review, 16% of the 195 defendants charged in federal cases have a known affiliation with right-wing militias or other groups that espouse violence. Researchers at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, a University of Chicago institute that looked at a larger group of arrestees that included local charges, found that 10% had known affiliations with such groups.<br />Federal authorities have said the Proud Boys and other extremist groups played a key role in the Capitol riot, but the breach would have been impossible without the larger mob, said Robert Pape, a political-science professor and founder of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats.<br />“What made it overwhelming is this mass surge into the Capitol of the 90% that are not part of organized militias,” Mr. Pape said."
