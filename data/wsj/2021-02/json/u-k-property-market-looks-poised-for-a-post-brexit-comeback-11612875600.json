    "body": "Britain is trapped in its third national lockdown as it battles a more contagious strain of the coronavirus. Its economy is likely to shrink again in the first quarter. But analysts are still forecasting a strong real estate rebound this year.<br />The biggest factor is that the U.K.’s deal to leave the European Union is finally completed, removing a political and economic uncertainty that has shadowed the market for years.<br />Britain’s vaccination program is also moving forward and economists expect growth to accelerate in the second half of the year.<br />The U.K.’s “settled new relationship” with Europe, plus low interest rates, will drive an uptick in commercial real-estate investment, said Miles Gibson, executive director of U.K. research for real-estate-services firm CBRE. The firm forecasts £48 billion, equivalent to about $66 billion, worth of investment this year, up 30% from £37 billion in 2020.<br />Colliers International  is a bit more bullish, predicting commercial property investment in the U.K. will accelerate by 36%."
