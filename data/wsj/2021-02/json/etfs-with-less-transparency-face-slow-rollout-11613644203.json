    "body": "Asset managers are rushing to launch a new breed of stock-picking exchange-traded fund, only to find that some of the biggest brokerages in the U.S. aren’t yet willing to pitch them to clients.<br />Fidelity Investments,  T. Rowe Price Group Inc.  and  Invesco Ltd.  are among the firms that have recently introduced semitransparent active ETFs, which combine features of mutual funds and traditional ETFs. The funds, which currently focus on U.S. stocks, are cheaper alternatives to mutual funds and give portfolio managers the chance to try to beat the market without running the risk of being copied or front-run. But they don’t disclose their daily holdings the way other ETFs do.<br />The funds have received a chilly reception so far from  Bank of America Corp. ,  UBS Group AG  and  Wells Fargo  & Co., which haven’t yet offered them to their wealth-management clients. Some bank executives say the strategy requires further scrutiny and a study of the funds’ long-term performance.<br />That has left the initial wave of fund launches cut off from a crucial source of support: BofA, UBS and Wells together manage more than $6 trillion in assets through their wealth-management divisions.<br />“It’s a process and a lot of work. We just don’t want to offer a lot of new products,” said Sandy Bolton, head of managed investments of Bank of America’s investment solutions group, of the approval process. “In this case, it’s in the best interest of clients.”"
