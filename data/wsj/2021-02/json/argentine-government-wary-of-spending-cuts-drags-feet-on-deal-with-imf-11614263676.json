    "body": "MEXICO CITY—Argentina’s leftist government is unlikely to reach a deal with the International Monetary Fund to repay $44 billion in debt before the country’s October midterm elections, extending the uncertainty for South America’s second biggest economy, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />While both sides had hoped to reach a deal by May, so far there have been no substantial discussions with the multilateral lender on key issues such as how the country plans to rein in runaway public spending to put government finances on more secure footing, said one person close to the negotiation.<br />“Talks haven’t reached the stage that you see when a deal is to be closed in a few months,” this person said. “There has been very little progress.”<br />The South American country is virtually broke, with just $5 billion in cash and gold reserves available for debt payments. It reached an agreement last year with private bondholders to postpone payments of $65 billion in debt, but must reach a separate deal with the IMF if the country hopes to regain access to international debt markets.<br />Argentina’s economy was already in recession before the pandemic, and shrank 10% last year, one of the steepest contractions in the world. The IMF expects Argentina’s economy to grow 4.5% this year."
