    "body": "President Biden’s nominee to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers and cattle ranchers are potential leaders in the new administration’s battle against climate change.<br />Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who led the USDA for eight years during the Obama administration, said Tuesday that government-funded incentives could get farmers and agricultural companies to adopt climate-friendly practices without the need for additional regulation, and could make U.S. food more attractive on export markets.<br />“Farmers are prepared for it and anxious to do it,” Mr. Vilsack said during a virtual confirmation hearing before the Senate agriculture committee. “If it’s voluntary, and incentive based, you will see farmers and ranchers cooperate extensively.”<br />The Senate committee voted Tuesday to advance Mr. Vilsack’s nomination to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. No date has yet been set for that vote, a committee spokeswoman said.<br />Proposals to change agricultural practices are one piece of Mr. Biden’s push to tackle climate change, which was on display in three executive orders issued last week suspending new oil and gas leases on federal land and boosting offshore wind production. Other cabinet nominees have said efforts to address climate change will inform the Biden administration’s infrastructure plans, and how it evaluates risks to the financial system."
