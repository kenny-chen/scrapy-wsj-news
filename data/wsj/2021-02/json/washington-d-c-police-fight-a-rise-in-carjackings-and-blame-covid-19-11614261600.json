    "body": "During the pandemic, police officers in Washington, D.C., started noticing a rise in a crime that alarmed them: teenagers forcibly stealing occupied cars and often going for joy rides.<br />Police departments in cities around the country are also reporting rises in carjackings, often committed by teens too young for their licenses.<br />This month, Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department launched a carjacking task force, along with federal law-enforcement officials, the district’s juvenile justice agency and police in nearby Maryland counties.<br />Law-enforcement officials blame the rise on a host of factors, including the switch to virtual schooling, the growing ranks of delivery drivers who are often targeted and less legal accountability due to pandemic-related delays and disruptions in the criminal justice system. Overall crime in Washington fell 19% in 2020 compared with the previous year, while carjackings jumped 143%, police department statistics show.<br />A department spokeswoman said the pandemic has given youths fewer opportunities overall to commit crime. Juvenile arrests in Washington dropped by 44% from 2019."
