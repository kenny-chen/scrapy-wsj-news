    "body": "Fidelity Investments sold nearly all of its positions in  GameStop Corp.  last month, just as shares of the videogame retailer were surging.<br />Fidelity’s GameStop stake dropped to 87 shares on Jan. 29 from 9.3 million shares, or 13% of the company, on Dec. 31, according to securities filings. The sales ended Fidelity’s run as the volatile stock’s largest shareholder.<br />It has been an eventful year for GameStop and its investors.<br />Shares of the company rocketed above $300 a share from less than $20 in January as individual investors turned to message boards on Reddit and urged one another to bid up the stock. The rally pressured other investors who were betting on a selloff. In the ensuing short squeeze, bearish investors had to buy more stock to close out their positions. Their purchases only drove the stock price higher.<br />Some bearish hedge funds, including Melvin Capital Management, took heavy losses—a development hailed by some individual investors as a triumph over Wall Street."
