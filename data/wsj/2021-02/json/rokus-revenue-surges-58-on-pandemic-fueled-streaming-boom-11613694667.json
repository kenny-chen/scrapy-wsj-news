    "body": "Roku Inc.  reported a 58% increase in revenue during the holiday quarter, as the streaming-media service continued to benefit from customers watching more entertainment while stuck at home during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />“We think the pandemic has accelerated, and permanently changed the curve on, the shift to streaming,” Roku Chief Executive Anthony Wood said Thursday.<br />Consumption of at-home streaming video entertainment has boomed during the pandemic as consumers have diverted more of their time and money to platforms such as Roku, the leading streaming-video competitor, with about 30% of the market, according to Strategy Analytics.<br />Roku sells smart televisions with built-in streaming technology, as well as devices that users can plug into TVs. However, the company generates the bulk of its revenue by selling ads on streaming channels and taking a share of the streaming service’s subscription revenue and ad inventory. The ad business has boomed as marketers, following their customers, are shifting more toward digital media.<br />The company’s total revenue rose to $649.9 million in the fourth quarter, up from $411.2 million a year earlier. Revenue at Roku’s platform business, which includes ad sales, jumped 82% to $471.2 million."
