    "body": "ROME—Italy’s president has summoned former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi for a meeting on Wednesday at noon where he is expected to ask him to form a new government.<br />The decision follows days of political consultations to assess whether a new government could be formed after the center-left one led by Giuseppe Conte collapsed because a small party withdrew its support.<br />President Sergio Mattarella said Tuesday night that Italy needs a high-profile government to confront the challenges posed by the pandemic on an economic, health and social level.<br />Mr. Mattarella said that holding early elections this spring would leave the country without a fully empowered government for a number of months at a time in which quick and important decisions need to be taken to confront the pandemic.<br />“I appeal to all political forces in Parliament to support a high-profile government,” said President Mattarella."
