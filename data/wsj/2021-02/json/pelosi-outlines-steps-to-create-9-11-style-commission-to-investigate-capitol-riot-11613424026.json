    "body": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday said Congress will establish an independent 9/11-style commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and “relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power.” She also called for new funding to keep lawmakers safe and secure the Capitol.<br />Mrs. Pelosi had previously enlisted retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré to lead a review of the security infrastructure, interagency processes, and command and control. In a letter to House members on Monday she said, “It is clear from his findings and from the impeachment trial that we must get to the truth of how this happened.”<br />The commission could satisfy Democrats who want to see Mr. Trump and others held to greater account for the Jan. 6 riot after the former president was acquitted Saturday in a Senate impeachment trial. Seven Republicans joined all 50 Democrats in voting to find Mr. Trump guilty of inciting the insurrection. That fell short of the 67 Senate votes needed to convict.<br />Some Democrats, however, have suggested—as did Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell in a blistering speech about Mr. Trump after Saturday’s vote—that the best venue is outside Congress.<br />“I think there’s grounds for further proceedings, both civil and criminal, against former President Trump,” Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,” noting he supports a 9/11-style commission."
