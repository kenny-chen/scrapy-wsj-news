    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Bill Cassidy emerged this week as a wild card in the trial over whether former President Donald Trump incited the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and he said Friday he still hasn’t made up his mind.<br />The Louisiana Republican surprised colleagues Tuesday when he voted with Democrats to assert the constitutionality of the trial and move ahead with the proceedings. Headed into the final days of the case, he has walked a fine line. He said that he has found the Democrats’ arguments compelling and had questions for Mr. Trump’s lawyers. But he also has insisted that his recent action didn’t indicate whether he would vote to convict Mr. Trump.<br />“The American people are counting on us actually coming to this with a mind ready to receive information,” Mr. Cassidy said. “And, yes there’s people on both sides of it who want your mind made up right now. But there’s a lot at stake here.”<br />Mr. Cassidy didn’t state his position Friday. He was photographed reviewing notes of a document that appeared to point toward acquittal, but later said it was one of two press releases his staff had prepared for each position. “If I had flipped the page, you would have had the one going the other way,” he said.<br />The notes he held read: “the House managers did not connect the dots to show President Trump knew that the attack on the Capitol was going to be violent and result in the loss of life.”"
