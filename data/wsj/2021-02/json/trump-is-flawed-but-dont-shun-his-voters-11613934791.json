    "body": "Regarding William A. Galston’s “The GOP Won’t Purge Trump” (Politics & Ideas, Feb. 17): Now that the gang that couldn’t impeach straight blew its chance to cancel any possibility of President Trump pulling a Grover Cleveland act in 2024, the chasm between the old, establishment Republican guard and the Trump-transmogrified GOP base has naturally widened. And as Mr. Galston pertinently points out, the only purge which is coming to pass, albeit thus far on the state level, is that of those isolated Republicans who voted to convict.<br />Clearly those Trump-fatigue-afflicted Republicans who see President Trump as a radioactive force within the GOP aren’t reading the tea leaves properly. They can take solace in the fact that the Great Disrupter’s last disruptive act, unlike so many of his others, hardly put America first. “Character is destiny,” said Heraclitus. Yet despite that domestic day of infamy, he’ll undoubtedly be the party’s kingmaker now, though it’s an open question whether he could rise like a phoenix to become the party’s standard-bearer again.<br />One thing is certain: With President Biden in the White House doing the radical Democrats’ bidding on every front, one can readily envision a redux of Trumpism in 2024, sans the sizzling melodrama of its progenitor.<br />James Hyland<br />Beechhurst, N.Y."
