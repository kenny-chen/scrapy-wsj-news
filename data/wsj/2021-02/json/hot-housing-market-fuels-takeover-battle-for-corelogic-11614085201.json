    "body": "CoreLogic Inc.,  once a sleepy data firm, is the focus of a takeover battle as the hot housing market drives up the value of home- and mortgage-data services.<br />The country’s largest provider of information on home values, mortgages and other housing statistics for financial firms and real-estate brokers agreed this month to accept an all-cash bid of $80 a share, or about $6 billion. The bid came from private-equity firms Stone Point Capital LLC and Insight Partners.<br />That bid won out over a competing all-stock offer at a nominally higher value from  CoStar Group Inc.,  one of the world’s largest providers of commercial real-estate data and online marketplaces.<br />But CoStar wasn’t ready to give up. Last week, it boosted its all-stock bid to about $96 a share at the time, or around $6.9 billion. That represented a premium of 17% to CoreLogic’s share price before CoStar made its offer.<br />If CoStar prevails, the Washington, D.C.-based data giant plans to use CoreLogic to challenge  Zillow Group Inc.  for dominance of the multibillion-dollar online home-sales marketplace. CoStar last year made its first push into the home-sales market by buying Homesnap Inc. for $250 million."
