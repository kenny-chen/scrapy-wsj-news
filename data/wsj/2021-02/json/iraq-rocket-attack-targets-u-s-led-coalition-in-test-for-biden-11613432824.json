    "body": "A rocket attack on the U.S.-led coalition in northern Iraq on Sunday killed a contractor and injured a U.S. service member and five other contractors, the U.S. military said.<br />The development represents an early test for President Biden in his role as a commander-in-chief. Similar attacks in 2019 and 2020 led then-President Trump to order retaliatory airstrikes against the Iranian-backed militia group U.S. officials said were responsible.<br />U.S., Iraqi officials and officials in the Kurdish semiautonomous region said investigations were under way to identify who was responsible for the Sunday attack.<br />The U.S. has about 2,500 troops in Iraq, whose mission is to mentor Iraqi troops and Kurdish Peshmerga forces.<br />“Initial report that indirect fire landed on coalition forces in Erbil tonight,” Colonel Wayne Morotto, the spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition, tweeted about the Sunday incident."
