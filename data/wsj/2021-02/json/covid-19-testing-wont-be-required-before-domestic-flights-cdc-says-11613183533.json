    "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it won’t currently recommend mandatory Covid-19 testing before domestic air travel, a proposal it had been weighing but met with strong objections from the airline industry.<br />“At this time, CDC is not recommending required point of departure testing for domestic travel,” the CDC said. “As part of our close monitoring of the pandemic, in particular the continued spread of variants, we will continue to review public health options for containing and mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the travel space.”<br />The CDC announcement comes after chief executives of major U.S. carriers—including  American Airlines Group Inc.,   United Airlines Holdings Inc.  and  Southwest Airlines Co. —met on Friday with White House officials. The meeting included Jeffrey Zients, who is coordinating the administration’s Covid-19 response.<br />The CDC didn’t offer an explanation for its decision and reiterated existing guidance urging the public not to travel amid the pandemic. In its statement, the CDC emphasized that people should still get tested before and after traveling and self-quarantine for at least seven days post-travel to reduce risk.<br />Airlines had broadly supported the international testing rules imposed by the Biden administration last month, but balked at the prospect of mandatory testing prior to domestic flights, fearing that it would crush already-depressed appetite for travel."
