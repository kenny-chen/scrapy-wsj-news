    "body": "Demand for long-lasting manufactured goods jumped in January, as the U.S. economic recovery gained momentum at the start of the year.<br />New orders for durable goods—products designed to last at least three years, such as computers and machinery—increased 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted $256.6 billion in January compared with December, the Commerce Department said Thursday.<br />It was the ninth straight month of gains and the largest percentage increase since July 2020. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 1% gain, after an upwardly revised 1.2% increase the previous month.<br />New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft—or so-called core capital-goods orders, a closely watched proxy for business investment—increased 0.5% in January from the previous month, to $72.9 billion. The gain was smaller than in recent months.<br />Excluding transportation, a category that can be particularly volatile, overall durable-goods orders increased 1.4% in January, down from a 1.7% gain in December."
