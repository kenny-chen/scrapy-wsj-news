    "body": "Marriott International Inc.  ended 2020 with a loss of $267 million—its first annual loss since 2009—as the company absorbed the effects of the downturn in global travel during a pandemic that emptied most of its rooms last March and continues to sap demand.<br />The results came after Arne Sorenson, the first person outside Marriott’s founding family to become its chief executive, died Monday. Two executives—Stephanie Linnartz and Tony Capuano—are currently leading Marriott’s day-to-day operations. Marriott has said the board will select a new chief within two weeks, and one of those two executives is expected to get that role, according to a person familiar with the situation.<br />The world’s largest hotel operator Thursday posted a fourth-quarter loss of $164 million, compared with a profit of $279 million in the prior year. It reported a loss of 50 cents a share, compared with a profit of 85 cents a share in the same period a year earlier.<br />Adjusted earnings were 12 cents a share, matching expectations of analysts polled by FactSet.<br />Revenue fell 59.6% to $2.17 billion. Analysts were looking for $2.41 billion."
