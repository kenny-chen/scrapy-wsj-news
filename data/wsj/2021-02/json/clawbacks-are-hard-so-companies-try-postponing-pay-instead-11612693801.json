    "body": "Companies are withholding more of their top officers’ pay for longer, hoping to avoid the hassle of recouping money when—or if—executives are later found responsible for misconduct.<br />The changes build on clawback provisions that have become widespread in compensation agreements, and are a recognition by companies that retaining unpaid compensation is easier than trying to recover it once it is in an executive’s hands.<br />When it comes to compensation, “the most effective way to recoup it is to never give it out to begin with,” said Charles Elson, a University of Delaware finance professor who helped a consortium of investors and health-care companies hammer out new pay-deferral guidelines. “The principle is that [executives] cannot benefit from improper conduct.”<br />Pharmaceutical manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. is requiring executives to hold three-quarters of their equity grants for at least a year after the awards vest, or become fully the executive’s.<br />Drugstore chains  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  and  CVS Health Corp.  have made misconduct a factor that lets companies revoke deferred pay. CVS also is holding back some pay even after an executive leaves the company."
