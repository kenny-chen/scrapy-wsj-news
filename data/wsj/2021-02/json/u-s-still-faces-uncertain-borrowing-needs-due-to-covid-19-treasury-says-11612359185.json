    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department on Wednesday announced few changes to its regular debt issuance schedule for the current quarter, while emphasizing the government continues to face uncertain and sizable borrowing needs due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The agency intends to maintain the size of nominal coupon auction sizes this quarter, after ramping up auction sizes last year to accommodate a surge in government spending to combat the pandemic and cushion the U.S. economy.<br />“Treasury believes that these changes have created sufficient capacity to address near-term projected borrowing needs,” said Brian Smith, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, in a statement on the agency’s quarterly borrowing needs.<br />The Treasury also will continue to gradually increase auction sizes for Treasury inflation-protected securities, as announced in November, boosting the size of those auctions by $10 billion to $20 billion over the 2021 calendar year.<br />The borrowing plans are consistent with expectations from the vast majority of primary dealers and recommendations from a Treasury borrowing advisory committee, a senior Treasury official said Wednesday morning. The plans also preserve flexibility for Treasury, in light of potential uncertainty about government spending and the possibility for another economic relief package in Congress, the official said."
