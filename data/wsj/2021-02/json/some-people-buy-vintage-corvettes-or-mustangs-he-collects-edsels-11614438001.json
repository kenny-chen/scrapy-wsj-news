    "body": "Hank Davis, 63, owner of Hank’s Garage, an auto shop and used car dealership in Bucyrus, Ohio, on his Edsels, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />My wife, Debbie, and I have been married for 44 years, and we have been collecting vintage cars and memorabilia all that time. We have probably owned over 200 vintage cars. We collect anything having to do with automobiles: vintage signs, gas pumps, gas station soda machines. One of the things that drew me to the Edsel was this: When you show up at a car show with a Corvette or a Mustang, there are always dozens of others there. When you show up at a car show with 400 cars and you are in an Edsel, yours is probably the only one there.<br />The story of the Edsel is one of the most interesting stories in all of car history.  Ford Motor Co.  built the Edsel to bridge the gap between the base Ford and the luxury Lincoln and Mercury, just like  General Motors  had the Buick and Oldsmobile between Chevrolet and Cadillac. The Edsel was its own brand, and when it rolled out on Sept. 4, 1957, 18 different models were available—the Edsel Ranger, the Pacer, the Corsair, the Citation, etc. [Ford declared the launch date “E-Day,” and marketed the car with an hour-long TV special starring Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong and Bob Hope.]<br /><br />"
