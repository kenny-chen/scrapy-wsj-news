    "body": "I spent the first tumultuous week of 2021 disconnected from news and social media, driving from Washington state to California. Having not seen my father since the spring, my teenage son and I decided to rent an RV to go visit him safely—and along the way we rediscovered the decency that has gone missing from our national politics.<br />Hitting the open road in an RV was on my bucket list, but our aspiration of a self-sufficient “guy trip” quickly turned to dependence on the kindness of strangers.<br />We rumbled into our first stop well past closing time. The rain was pounding. I had no idea where to park, what to pay, how to hook up our generator or pump water. For a moment I was ready to gas up and go home, but then I saw a flashlight waving through the soggy darkness and rolled down my window.<br />“Are you Kelly?” an elderly woman shouted through the storm.<br />“Yes! Yes!” I sounded like a hostage being rescued."
