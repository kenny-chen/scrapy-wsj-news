    "body": "Elon Musk talks about a lot of things on  Twitter ,  but  Tesla Inc.’s  disclosure Monday about the company’s investment in bitcoin casts new light on a series of tweets he made about the cryptocurrency in December.<br />Among other bitcoin-related tweets on Dec. 20, the Tesla chief executive used his Twitter account to post an explicit meme showing what appears to be a bearded monk with the words “Me trying to live a normal productive life” pasted over him. The monk is standing near a woman with the word bitcoin pasted over her.<br />That graphic elicited a response from Michael Saylor, founder and chief executive of MicroStrategy Inc., a publicly traded enterprise-software company that has invested in bitcoin and made it the company’s reserve asset.<br />“If you want to do your shareholders a $100 billion favor, convert the [Tesla] balance sheet from [U.S. dollars to bitcoin]. Other firms on the S&P 500 would follow your lead & in time it would grow to become a $1 trillion favor,” Mr. Saylor said in a tweet.<br />“Are such large transactions even possible?” Mr. Musk said in response to him. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
