    "body": "Natural-gas shortages were a major culprit in the blackouts that left millions freezing in the dark in Texas last week, but making the delivery system more resilient promises to be expensive as well as politically challenging.<br />Texas is normally flush with gas, as the nation’s largest producer. But both production and power generation from gas dropped by about a third last week during an unusually strong winter storm that caused demand for power and heat to surge.<br />Freezing water and blackouts wreaked havoc on everything from wells in the prolific Permian Basin to pipelines and regional storage facilities that feed power plants across the state. The resulting gas shortage sent prices soaring and disadvantaged power plants that purchase daily fuel supplies on the spot market.<br />The state’s gas infrastructure and power generation failed for similar reasons: Neither is designed to perform in subfreezing weather, unlike similar equipment in parts of the U.S. where colder temperatures are more common.<br />Engineers said Texas gas production was slowed by low temperatures that froze water produced alongside oil and gas and entered oil-field tanks. Compressors that help move oil and gas through pipelines also became inoperable because of the cold weather."
