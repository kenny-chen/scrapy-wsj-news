    "body": "WASHINGTON—Widows replacing their late husbands once was a common path for women to enter Congress, but the practice dwindled over time. This year, the coronavirus pandemic might bring it back.<br />Susan Wright, the wife of the late Rep. Ron Wright, said Wednesday she would run for the Texas Republican’s seat, the second widow to announce a House campaign this year. She follows Julia Letlow, the spouse of late Rep.-elect Luke Letlow (R., La.), who announced her candidacy last month.<br />While dozens of lawmakers have been sickened by Covid-19 since last March, Messrs. Wright and Letlow are the only congressmen or congressmen-elect to die after contracting it.<br />“I’m running for Congress to continue my husband’s legacy by supporting economic growth, reforming our broken healthcare system, and defending Texas conservative values,” Mrs. Wright said Wednesday, announcing her campaign. A former training director for airlines, Mrs. Wright also worked as a district director for two members of the Texas state House.<br />Mr. Wright died earlier this month at the age of 67, at the start of his second term in the House, after being hospitalized for Covid-19. He was also undergoing cancer treatments."
