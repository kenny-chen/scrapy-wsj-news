    "body": "“At Work: The Challenges of Getting Long-Covid Patients Working” (Personal Journal, Feb. 16) could have been describing sufferers of myalgic encephalomyelitis, otherwise known as chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The similarities between long-haul Covid-19 and ME/CFS are stunning. Perhaps the sheer volume of the cases of Covid long-haulers will shed a light on ME/CFS, which is a much-ignored condition. People with ME/CFS experience the same “crash” after a period of physical or mental exertion, as well as many of the other symptoms described in the article, and skepticism from co-workers.<br />Perhaps as more study is done on Covid long-haulers there will be unanticipated spillover benefit for those suffering with ME/CFS.<br />Denise M.
