    "body": "Peggy Noonan is correct when she says that most people aren’t “passionately immersed in politics” and that they “see politics as it goes by on their screens” (“Liz Cheney Wins One for Sanity,” Declarations, Feb. 6). What they’ve witnessed in the last 50 years is that every time a hard truth is gently given it’s defeated by the blitzkrieg of Democratic special-interest groups that have never found a hill they were not willing to die on. Many conservatives who have viewed this have become demoralized and discouraged with the America they see and live in.<br />So, I ask Ms. Noonan, who is really to blame for the bully who occupied the White House for the last four years? Is it those who sought someone to fight for them or is it the Republican Party that never understood its opponents enough to fight them on their terms, to stand for hard truths and to find at least one hill they were willing to die on?<br />Keith P.
