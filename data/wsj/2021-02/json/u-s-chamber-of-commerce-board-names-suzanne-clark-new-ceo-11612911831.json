    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday named Suzanne Clark as its new chief executive, succeeding retiring CEO Thomas Donohue, who has led the organization since 1997.<br />Ms. Clark, 53 years old, a longtime ally of Mr. Donohue, 82, has served as president since 2019 and will retain that title along with that of CEO. The appointment, which takes effect March 11, had been expected.<br />“Suzanne Clark’s extensive experience through ever increasing responsibilities during her more than 16 years at the Chamber, combined with her ambitious vision and ongoing work to strengthen the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, make her the resounding choice to lead the organization into the future,” Chamber Board Chairman Christopher Lofgren said in a statement.<br />Ms. Clark will be the first woman to lead the 100-year-old organization, which has long been regarded as corporate America’s principal voice in Washington. But she takes over at a challenging time.<br />In the past decade, the Chamber and other business interests have lost influence in Washington as more extreme ideologies have gained ground in both the Republican and Democratic parties, leaving fewer lawmakers to promote business-friendly policies."
