    "body": "NEW DELHI—India is hoisting spending on infrastructure, hoping to lift its economy out of one of the world’s worst Covid-19 recessions.<br />India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday unveiled ambitious spending plans in the country’s budget for the year starting April. Increased spending on roads, education, hospitals and other infrastructure is necessary to bring the country back to high growth, she said.<br />“Our government is fully prepared to support and facilitate the economy’s reset,” she said. “This budget provides every opportunity for our economy to raise and capture the pace that it needs.”<br />Following a deep dive in economic activity and government revenues caused by the coronavirus, the budget basically tosses out New Delhi’s yearslong campaign to reduce its budget deficit.<br />India started this fiscal year, which ends March 31, with a target of keeping the budget deficit to 3.5% of gross domestic product. It now says that figure will be close to 9.5%, and next year’s figure will be 6.8%."
