    "body": "On the same day the Journal reported on the struggles to access Covid-19 tests in lower-income areas of the U.S. (“Tests Still Hard to Get in Poorer Areas,” U.S. News, Jan. 25), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report on the National Football Leagues’ Covid-19 mitigation measures. As reported in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 623,000 Covid-19 PCR tests were performed on 11,400 players and staff from Aug. 9 to Nov. 21, 2020. Thus, over this 15-week period, an average of 55 tests were performed on each person. While frequent testing of NFL players and staff helped ensure the NFL season, it is unfortunate that gaps in access to testing is still commonplace across the country. Covid-19 testing is essential to identify cases and prevent spread of the virus.<br />Harold C. Wiesenfeld, M.D.<br />Pittsburgh"
