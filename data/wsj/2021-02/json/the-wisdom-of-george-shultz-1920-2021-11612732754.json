    "body": "George P. Shultz, who served as secretary of labor, Treasury and state, died Saturday at 100. A related editorial appears nearby. These are excerpts of his contributions to the Journal editorial pages.<br /><br />“A World Free of Nuclear Weapons,” written with William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn, Jan. 4, 2007:<br />Nuclear weapons today present tremendous dangers, but also an historic opportunity. . . . Reassertion of the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and practical measures toward achieving that goal would be, and would be perceived as, a bold initiative consistent with America’s moral heritage. The effort could have a profoundly positive impact on the security of future generations. Without the bold vision, the actions will not be perceived as fair or urgent. Without the actions, the vision will not be perceived as realistic or possible.<br />We endorse setting the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons and working energetically on the actions required to achieve that goal."
