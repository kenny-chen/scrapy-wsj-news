    "body": "The State Department said Tuesday that the Myanmar military’s detention of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint constitutes a coup.<br />The legal assessment has important symbolic significance and will force the curtailment of U.S. assistance to the Myanmar government, though that aid is very limited.<br />Humanitarian aid and programs to support civil society will continue, the State Department said. The Biden administration is still weighing broader sanctions.<br />“After careful review of the facts and circumstances, we have assessed that Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma’s ruling party, and Win Myint, the duly elected head of government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1,” a State Department official said Tuesday, using another name for Myanmar. “We continue to call on the Burmese military leadership to release them and all other detained civil society and political leaders immediately and unconditionally.”<br />For the day and a half since reports of the military take-over in Myanmar emerged, the Biden administration had refrained from calling the action a coup, saying the matter was under legal review."
