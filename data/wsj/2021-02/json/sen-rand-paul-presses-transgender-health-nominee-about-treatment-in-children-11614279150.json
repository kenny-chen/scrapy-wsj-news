    "body": "A hearing for a transgender person nominated by President Biden for a top administration health position turned tense Thursday as she was pressed over her stance on gender dysphoria treatment for minors.<br />Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky started his questioning by mentioning “genital mutilation” to Dr. Rachel Levine, the nominee for assistant health secretary.<br />He then asked her during Thursday’s Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing if she supports hormone therapy or sex-reassignment therapy in minors with gender dysphoria. “We should be outraged that someone’s talking to a three year old about changing their sex,” said Mr. Paul, an ophthalmologist.<br />Mr. Paul added, “You give a woman enough testosterone to grow a beard, you think she’ll go back?”<br />Gender dysphoria—a conflict between a person’s sex assigned at birth and the gender with which a person identifies—is recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and other professional associations as a medical issue."
