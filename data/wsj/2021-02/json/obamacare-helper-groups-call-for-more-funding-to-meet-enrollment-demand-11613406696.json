    "body": "The reopening of enrollment for Affordable Care Act health insurance on federal exchanges has some ACA support groups worried that they won’t get more funding to meet the new demand, which could hinder their ability to help consumers choose plans.<br />The regular ACA sign up period ended on Dec. 15. But President Biden last month signed an executive order launching a special 90-day enrollment period for ACA coverage, which starts Monday and lasts 90 days. The administration said the pandemic’s impact on healthcare and the economy called for an extension of the sign-up period.<br />The extension wasn’t expected, however, so its success may hinge on public awareness, which the administration is looking to increase through a $50 million marketing campaign.<br />The organizations, called navigators and which help individuals determine eligibility and pick plans, say they haven’t heard if they will also get more funding for the new period. Some navigators say they have already spent much of the federal grant money they received for the regular enrollment period, and they will need more.<br />The enrollment process has gotten more intensive and costly, the groups say, because the pandemic’s economic impact has left millions without jobs and seeking coverage on the exchanges. The navigators frequently assist hard-to-reach consumers including uninsured people and immigrants."
