    "body": "Aunt Jemima is now Pearl Milling Co.<br />The PepsiCo Inc. unit that sells Aunt Jemima pancake products unveiled the new name on Tuesday, officially retiring a brand that had come under criticism for its origins in racist imagery of Black people.<br />Pearl Milling Co. was the creator of the original self-rising pancake mix, first marketed as “Self-Rising Pancake Flour” before it was trademarked in 1890 under the Aunt Jemima brand.<br />The new packaging, which will appear in June, will retain much of the current colors and design. The company had already dropped the image of a Black woman from its bottles and boxes.<br />“Our changes are in line with PepsiCo’s journey toward racial equality, and the evolution will help carry the 130-year-old brand into the future,” PepsiCo said."
