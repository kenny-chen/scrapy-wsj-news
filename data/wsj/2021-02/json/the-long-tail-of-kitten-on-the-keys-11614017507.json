    "body": "<br /><br /><br />In February 1921, a composer-pianist with the quirky name Zez Confrey (from his middle name, Elzear) recorded an original piece that grabbed pianists and listeners by their ears, became a bestseller and left a permanent imprint on American music. “Kitten on the Keys” heralded a fresh, zippy style of music dubbed novelty piano.<br />Like his near-contemporary and fellow virtuoso George Gershwin, Confrey grounded himself in both classical and popular idioms. After studying at a Chicago conservatory, Confrey whetted his keyboard skills by arranging player-piano rolls of pop music, embellishing notes and enriching harmonies. His roll work—about 170 pieces—remains an effervescent emblem of the 1920s. He went on to compose a variety of popular works, but he has been largely and unjustifiably forgotten."
