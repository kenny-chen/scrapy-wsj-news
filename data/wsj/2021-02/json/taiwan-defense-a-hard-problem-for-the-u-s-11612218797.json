    "body": "Perhaps Elbridge Colby is right—it may be time to clearly define where we stand with regard to China (“America Can Defend Taiwan,” op-ed, Jan. 27).<br />It is inconceivable that the powerful, proud and growing menace that is China today would set itself up to lose a war over Taiwan. Will China lay it on the line to establish, once and for all, that it will not be shoved around by the once-mighty U.S.?
