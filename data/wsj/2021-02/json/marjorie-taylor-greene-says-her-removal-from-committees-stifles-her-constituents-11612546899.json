    "body": "WASHINGTON—Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who was removed from her committee assignments over her past embrace of conspiracy theories, said Friday that the move would stifle her constituents—but added that serving on committees under Democratic control was a waste of her time.<br />Mrs. Greene, speaking to reporters in a combative press conference, said lawmakers who voted to remove her from the committees “actually stripped my district of their voice, they stripped my voters of having representation to work for them.”<br />The House voted 230-199 on Thursday to remove Mrs. Greene from the budget and education committees, with 11 Republicans siding with Democrats. The move will diminish Mrs. Greene’s ability to shape legislation and work with other lawmakers, sidelining her just weeks into her first term in office.<br />Still, Mrs. Greene said that she felt freed by the decision because Democrats held the power in Washington.<br />“If I was on a committee, I’d be wasting my time because my conservative values wouldn’t be heard and neither would my district’s,” she said."
