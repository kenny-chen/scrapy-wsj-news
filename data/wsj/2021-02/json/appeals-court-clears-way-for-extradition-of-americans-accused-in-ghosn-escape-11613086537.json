    "body": "BOSTON—A federal appeals court cleared the way Thursday for the extradition to Japan of two Americans accused of helping smuggle former auto titan Carlos Ghosn out of that country by hiding him inside a music equipment box.<br />The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, denying an emergency motion to stay extradition, means Michael L. Taylor and his son Peter M. Taylor could be on a plane to Japan as soon as Friday, barring any last-minute legal intervention.<br />Lawyers for the Taylors didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />The Taylors were arrested in May at their family home near Boston by federal authorities acting at the behest of Japanese prosecutors. They have spent the past nine months in a county jail, fighting multiple court battles to avoid being sent to Japan to face criminal charges in the escape.<br />A former chief executive of Nissan Motor Co., Mr. Ghosn was facing financial crime charges in Japan and living in a court-monitored house in Tokyo when he disappeared in late 2019. In a plot worthy of Hollywood, he took a bullet train 300 miles from Tokyo to Osaka, then was smuggled inside the huge box onto a waiting private jet."
