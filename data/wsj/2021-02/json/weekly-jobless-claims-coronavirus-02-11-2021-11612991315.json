    "body": "Unemployment claims are approaching a month of declines as the labor market offers early signs that it is starting to mend from a steep slowdown.<br />Economists expect the number of workers applying for unemployment benefits—a proxy for layoffs—fell to 760,000 last week from 779,000 a week earlier. Weekly claims have steadily declined since early January when they exceeded 900,000. Filings remain above the pre-pandemic peak of 695,000.<br />Employers resumed hiring in January after payrolls fell at the end of 2020, and job openings picked up, driven by growth in industries that have weathered the pandemic relatively well.<br />The worst of the pandemic’s effects on the job market appear to have passed, said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies LLC.<br />“Things are really starting to improve again in the labor market,” she said."
