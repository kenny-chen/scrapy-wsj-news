    "body": "Numerous senior officials have recently departed New York state’s Health Department. What exactly did they know before deciding to stop working for Gov. Andrew Cuomo? Empire State citizens deserve an answer and  federal law enforcement ought to be interested as well.<br />The New York Post’s Bernadette Hogan, Carl Campanile and Bruce Golding break the story of an appalling abuse of power:<br />Ms. DeRosa is now claiming that Team Cuomo was cooperative and transparent in sharing information with the U.S. Department of Justice. But New York’s failure to publicly acknowledge its nursing home death toll and prioritize the protection of the elderly—the state instead inflicted broad, destructive lockdowns on the general population—had consequences far beyond New York. The state was an early virus hot spot and its false data presented a misleading picture of Covid impact as scientists and policy makers sought to understand the new health threat.<br />In the wake of the Post report, Jesse McKinley and Luis Ferré-Sadurní of the New York Times note:<br />One wonders how long the truth about nursing home deaths might have remained hidden if a few stout-hearted contrarians like Janice Dean of Fox News, the Albany Times-Union newspaper and the Empire Center think tank had not diligently challenged the official story."
