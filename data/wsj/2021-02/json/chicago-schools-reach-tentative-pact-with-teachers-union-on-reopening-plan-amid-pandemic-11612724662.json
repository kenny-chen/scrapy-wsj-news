    "body": "School leaders in Chicago and San Francisco on Sunday announced tentative agreements with teachers unions to reopen schools, tamping down what had become heated negotiations in both cities.<br />Chicago’s mayor said Sunday that a tentative written deal with the teachers union could reopen in-person learning for elementary-school students this week for the first time since March. The agreement capped months of negotiations that had recently deteriorated to the point where the city was threatening to block Chicago teachers from logging into remote learning and the teachers were threatening to not show up for work.<br />On Friday, talks had reached an impasse after the city issued a “last, best and final offer,” with the two sides apparently heading toward a lockout and strike. Then talks unexpectedly resumed on Saturday.<br />“We are here to deliver the very good news that our children will be returning to in-person learning this week,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a media briefing Sunday. “This agreement was about making sure that everyone in our school communities aren’t just safe but also that they feel safe.”<br />The Chicago Teachers Union was more cautious in how it described the deal on Twitter."
