    "body": "Pittsburgh<br />Unless you are one of the online gamblers who have succumbed to the nonstop sports book ads to “make it rain,” the Super Bowl can sometimes be a dry affair. If you’re one of the 323 million Americans who don’t live in Kansas City or Tampa Bay, you need to establish some kind of rooting interest. People have all sorts or reasons for how they choose a side, some as simple as liking the uniform colors.<br />My own tools are a bit more obscure, but they may help others provide a cheering rationale.<br />There is the Baconesque technique of rooting for a Chiefs win so that the Jets could indirectly be the best team in the National Football League because in the regular season they beat the Rams who beat the Seahawks who beat the Dolphins who beat the Raiders who beat the Chiefs. Voilà.<br />Some choose based on the city itself. Who doesn’t love a small-market team over Los Angeles, New York or Boston? No immense metropolises are involved this year, but the Tampa area is 50% larger than metro Kansas City. It is also unfairly warmer. Advantage: Chiefs."
