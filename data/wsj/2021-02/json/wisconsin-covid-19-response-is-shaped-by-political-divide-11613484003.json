    "body": "In a nation split over how best to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, Wisconsin has exemplified the divisions.<br />Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and the Republican-controlled legislature have had a running feud over mask mandates and other restrictions for much of the past year, triggering multiple lawsuits.<br />The state’s two largest cities—the Democratic strongholds of Milwaukee and Madison—have implemented tighter restrictions on bars and restaurants, while those outside the urban centers have faced fewer limitations. Some establishments along the state’s borders with Minnesota and Illinois, where rules are more stringent, have actually seen a boost in business.<br />In the most recent episode of dueling moves by the governor and legislature, Wisconsin residents experienced whiplash Feb. 4 when within the course of about an hour the state went from having a mask mandate, to not having one, to having one again.<br />“There is an inability to reach an agreement and move things forward,” said Charles Franklin, director of a statewide poll conducted by Marquette Law School. “What we have seen for almost a year now is legislative opposition to some of the governor’s actions, but then the legislature has not advanced its own proposal.”"
