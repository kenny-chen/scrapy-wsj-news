    "body": "Voting-machine company Smartmatic USA Corp. sued  Fox Corp.’s  Fox News, seeking $2.7 billion in damages for what it alleges were defamatory on-air comments about the company’s products in the aftermath of the presidential election.<br />The suit, filed Thursday in a New York court, focuses on a series of statements made about Smartmatic on Fox News by lawyers who supported former President Donald Trump’s claims that the election was rigged, including Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. The lawsuit also mentions remarks made about Smartmatic by Fox News Media anchors including Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo.<br />Smartmatic’s complaint claims that the segments on Fox News contained numerous errors involving the reliability of its technology, and that Fox News knew its statements about Smartmatic were untruthful.<br />A group of federal and state officials have said there is no evidence that any voting system changed or deleted votes in the 2020 general election.<br />“Fox News Media is committed to providing the full context of every story with in-depth reporting and clear opinion,” the network said in a statement on behalf of Fox News and the Fox hosts named in the complaint. “We are proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend this meritless lawsuit in court.”"
