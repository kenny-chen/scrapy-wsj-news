    "body": "PARIS—French bank  BNP Paribas SA  reported a drop in fourth-quarter profit, hurt by record low interest rates and the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, but said it expected revenue to bounce back this year as the global economy gradually recovers.<br />France’s biggest bank by assets said net profit for the three months to Dec. 31 fell by 13.9% to €1.59 billion euros, equivalent to $1.9 billion, and revenue declined by 4.5% to €10.83 billion, dented by a weak insurance and consumer credit business.<br />Still, the bank’s earnings and outlook were slightly above expectations, underscoring the resilience of BNP Paribas’s diversified business model, analysts said.<br />The Paris-based lender said it expected revenue to increase next year as its cost of risk, which reflects provisions for bad loans, declined.<br />France’s economy has been badly bruised by two national lockdowns to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed over 37,000 people in the country and infected millions. The government’s massive subsidy program, rolled out last spring to prevent widespread unemployment, has helped cushion the economic blow."
