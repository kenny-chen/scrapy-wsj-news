    "body": "U.S. government bonds showed signs of stabilizing Friday, pushing yields lower a day after a chaotic session had sent them soaring.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 1.459%, according to Tradeweb, down from 1.513% at Thursday’s close. The 10-year yield rose more than 0.3% in February for the largest one-month rise since November 2016.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed sharply on Thursday as a weekslong selloff intensified—fueled by bets that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates earlier than previously expected in response to what investors widely expect to be a burst of economic growth and inflation later this year.<br />The 10-year yield logged its largest one-day gain since Nov. 9 during Thursday’s session to finish at its highest closing level in a year. The five-year yield, which is more sensitive to the near-term outlook for interest rates, experienced its largest one-day gain in more than 10 years.<br />Higher yields, though, helped investors regain their appetite for Treasurys on Friday. Demand was also boosted by it being the last trading session of the month, when many fund managers buy Treasurys to match the adjustments in their benchmark bond indexes."
