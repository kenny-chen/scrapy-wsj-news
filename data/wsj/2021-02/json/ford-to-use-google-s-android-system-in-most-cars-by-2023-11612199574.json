The computing service will also be used to organize production.<br />Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed.<br />Silicon Valley firms are pushing further into the auto business, eager to capitalize on the growth prospects of the car’s evolution as a rolling personal device. Tech companies now provide core operating systems to run in-vehicle multimedia systems, while also providing cloud-based service to store and manage the proliferation of data produced by cars, many of which now are sold with broadband connections."
