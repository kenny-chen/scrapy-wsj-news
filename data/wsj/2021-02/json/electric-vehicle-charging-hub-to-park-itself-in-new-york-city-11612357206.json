    "body": "Revel, the company best known for electric-moped sharing, says it is about to embark in a new direction by launching one of the largest hubs for quickly charging electric vehicles in New York City this spring.<br />The facility will be located at the site of the former Pfizer building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and would have 30 stations open around the clock, capable of delivering 100 miles of charge to vehicles in about 20 minutes, the company said.<br />“If New York City is going to push large-scale electrification somebody needs to be building the infrastructure and Revel is leading the charge,” said Frank Reig, Revel’s co-founder and chief executive.<br />Revel has a fleet of about 3,000 electric mopeds, which can be rented by the minute, in New York. Mr. Reig said the expansion of Revel’s business into electric-vehicle charging fits the company’s mission of expanding green technology.<br />Limited charging availability is seen as an impediment to electric-vehicle growth, especially in densely populated New York where many people don’t live in a home with access to electricity close to where they park their vehicle."
