    "body": "New York City police are searching for clues and flooding city subway lines after four homeless people were stabbed, two of them fatally, within the system on Friday and early Saturday, according to police officials.<br />The four stabbings occurred on the A train line in Manhattan and Queens in separate, unprovoked attacks, New York City Police Department officials said in a news briefing Saturday.<br />The two surviving victims told investigators they were attacked by a light-skinned man wearing a mask who fled after the assaults, officials said. This has led investigators to believe that all four of the stabbings may have been perpetrated by the same person. But the investigation was preliminary, and investigators are considering the possibility that the attacks may have been carried out by multiple people, officials said.<br />NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said a “small army” of detectives had been dispatched to investigate the cases and that a description of a suspect or suspects would be available soon.<br />Mr. Shea also said the NYPD had dispatched an additional 500 uniformed officers to subway trains and stations to secure the transit system and ensure that riders felt safe."
