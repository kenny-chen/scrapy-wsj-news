    "body": "The most powerful conservative medium in America—indeed, in the Western world—is talk radio. Tens of millions of people regularly listen to local and national radio talk hosts. Whenever I have European conservative writers on my own national show, I always note that in terms of conservative influence, the great difference between America and their countries is that we have talk radio and they don’t. Every guest has agreed.<br />This was largely thanks to one man: Rush Limbaugh. There was talk radio before Rush, but he made it into a national force.<br />Liberals and leftists dismissed him throughout his career, and again in their obituaries this week, as “divisive,” as if the left hasn’t been the most divisive force in America since the Civil War. This lack of self-awareness on the part of the left is mind-numbing.<br />Calling America “systemically racist,” calling every white American “racist,” and separating college dorms and graduating exercises by race—that’s not divisive?<br />Using the  New York Times ’s  demonstrably false “1619 Project” to teach America’s schoolchildren that our country wasn’t founded in 1776 but in 1619, when the first black slaves arrived in North America, and that the Revolutionary War was fought to preserve slavery—that’s not divisive?"
