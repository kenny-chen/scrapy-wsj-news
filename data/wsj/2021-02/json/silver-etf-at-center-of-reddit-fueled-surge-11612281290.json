    "body": "A flood of money into one exchange-traded fund has helped drive the surge in silver prices, underscoring the influence ETFs can exert on commodity markets at times of rampant demand among individual investors.<br />Individual investors on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets have migrated toward silver in recent days, generating huge inflows for  BlackRock Inc.’s   iShares Silver Trust ,  an ETF commonly known by its ticker, SLV.<br />The fund took in a net $868 million Friday, its biggest one-day influx since it was created in 2006. A further $511 million entered the fund Monday, when silver futures prices posted their biggest one-day advance in over a decade and hit an eight-year high.<br />Silver prices retreated Tuesday, falling 8.9% to $26.89 a troy ounce, after  CME Group  said it was imposing stricter margin requirements on futures for the precious metal, which would make them more expensive to trade on its Comex exchange. Other assets that have been touted by traders gathering in online forums also slumped: Shares of  GameStop  Corp.  dropped roughly 50%, while  AMC Entertainment Holdings  fell almost 40%.<br />Shares of SLV—which manages over $18 billion in assets, according to BlackRock—dropped more than 7% Tuesday, erasing most of its gains for the year."
