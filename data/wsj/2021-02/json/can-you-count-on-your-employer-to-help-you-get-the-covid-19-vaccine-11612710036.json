    "body": "With the Covid-19 vaccine slowly rolling out, many workers are wondering whether they can count on their employer to help them get shots.<br /><br />The bottom line<br />Many employers are trying to provide updates on local vaccination protocols and to combat misinformation among their employees. But with the exception of workers in hospitals, nursing homes and some food-processing plants, it is unlikely employees outside the highest-priority groups of Tier 1 can expect to receive a Covid-19 vaccine at work or through their employer in the next few months.<br />A January survey of 494 employers by consulting firm Willis  Towers Watson  found that while almost 80% were planning or considering actions to develop policies and procedures to make it easy for workers to get the vaccine, only 14% had taken steps to do so. About 15% reported lobbying state officials to prioritize their employees for the vaccine."
