    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged higher Wednesday, with technology stocks poised to lead gains as investors cheered corporate earnings and the prospect of more fiscal stimulus.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked up 0.4%, suggesting that the broader market will extend its rally, though contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down about 0.1%. Tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.6% after Alphabet and  Amazon.com  reported strong sales growth late Tuesday.<br />Stock markets have rallied this week, shaking off concerns about stretched valuations, a sharp run-up in prices for a handful of stocks and silver, a weak economic backdrop and the threat of new coronavirus variants. Investors have focused instead on better-than-expected corporate results and bets that President Biden will deliver more fiscal spending in coming weeks.<br />“The last two days have seen the return of the feeling that we still have monetary stimulus in the background and the prospect of an additional stimulus package to come,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Advisors. “The path ahead isn’t a smooth one, but we think it is an upward one.”<br />Shares in Alphabet climbed over 7% in premarket trading after the parent of Google said late Tuesday that it had booked record revenue in the fourth quarter."
