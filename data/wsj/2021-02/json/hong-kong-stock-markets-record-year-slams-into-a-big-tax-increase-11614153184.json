    "body": "Hong Kong moved unexpectedly to raise taxes on share trading by 30%, putting a damper on the city’s stock-exchange operator just as it was unveiling record annual sales and profits.<br />A surge in trading and new listings has buoyed  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. , which has grown to become the world’s largest exchange operator based on its own market valuation, and the fourth-biggest by value of companies listed on its exchange.<br />The group’s ascendance also reflects the rise of China’s financial markets to become some of the world’s biggest and most important after those in New York.<br />On Wednesday, however, Hong Kong’s government spoiled what should have been a victory lap for Hong Kong Exchanges. The government appoints half of the company’s board, including its chairman, and holds a stake in the business.<br />Paul Chan, the city’s financial secretary, proposed lifting the so-called stamp duty on stocks to 0.13% from 0.1%, as part of Hong Kong’s annual budget. Hong Kong is reeling from the effects of the pandemic and earlier social unrest, with its economy shrinking by a record 6.1% last year."
