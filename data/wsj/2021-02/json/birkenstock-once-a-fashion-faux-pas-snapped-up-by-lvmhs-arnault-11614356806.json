    "body": "PARIS—A group of investors led by luxury titan Bernard Arnault has acquired a majority stake in Birkenstock GmbH, valuing the sandal maker at around four billion euros, equivalent to $4.87 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The 250-year-old German company announced Friday that owners Christian and Alex Birkenstock had sold more than half of the firm to L Catterton, the private-equity firm Mr. Arnault co-owns, and the Arnault family holding company Financière Agache. That places Birkenstock in the Arnault family portfolio alongside  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE ,  the globe-spanning luxury conglomerate that Mr. Arnault controls.<br />“We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage,” Mr. Arnault said.<br />The investment is a sign of how the fashion world has come around to a brand that it once snubbed as the unglamorous footwear of granola-eating hippies.<br />Boot maker Johann Adam Birkenstock founded the company in 1774, but the sandals first arrived in the U.S. in the 1960s on the feet of Margot Fraser, a dressmaker who grew up in Germany. Ms. Fraser was turned away from shoe stores as she tried to find a distributor for Birkenstock. She eventually ended up selling the sandals out of a health-food store in California."
