    "body": "Jersey City has placed its police department under the leadership of a civilian in an unusual arrangement meant to bring greater transparency and accountability to law enforcement there, Mayor Steven Fulop said.<br />Mr. Fulop, who has enacted a number of reforms to the police force in Jersey City while driving crime rates down, placed the Jersey City Police Department under the leadership of Police Director Tawana Moody this month with the retirement of former Jersey City Police Chief Michael Kelly at age 59. It’s the first time a civilian will lead the department.<br />Police agencies around the country are rethinking the roles of officers and civilians in public safety, including New York City across the Hudson River.<br />Mr. Fulop, a Democrat who took office in 2013, said the decision to place Ms. Moody at the head of the JCPD, instead of another sworn chief, was motivated by a desire to speed reforms.<br />“Not having a uniformed officer, with biases and relationships of being that uniformed officer for the last 20 or 30 years, is going to ultimately help this city move forward,” Mr. Fulop said. “That different perspective adds value to the entire organization.”"
