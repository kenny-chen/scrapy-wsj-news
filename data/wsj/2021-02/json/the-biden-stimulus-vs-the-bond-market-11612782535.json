    "body": "Some prominent U.S. economists believe that the Biden administration’s proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package is so large that it could overheat the economy. But the bond market seems to be in total disagreement, as are global financial markets generally.<br />Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and former International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard both recently suggested that the Biden administration risks overheating the economy. Mr. Blanchard suggested on Twitter that the program could lead to “not the 2.5% [inflation] that some predict, but potentially a lot more,” prompting “a very large increase in interest rates.”<br />Supporters of the argument might point to rising bond yields. At around 1.19%, the 10-year Treasury yield is at its highest level since early March. Inflation pricing in the bond market is back to levels last seen in 2014.<br />But those are levels that suggest a recovery, not an inflationary burnout. The U.S. yield curve still bears far more similarity to last summer’s depressed levels than its immediate post-2008 crisis steep slope.<br />If Mr. Summers and Mr. Blanchard are correct, then that entire lower-for-longer post-2008 paradigm would be at an end. Pushing long-end U.S. bond yields simply back to where they were at the end of 2010 would mean a tectonic shift—a once-in-a-generation money-making opportunity for bond bears, before even considering the effect on credit markets or equities."
