    "body": "Four pharmaceutical companies in settlement talks with states to resolve claims related to their involvement in the national opioid crisis stand to reap about $1 billion each in tax breaks if a combined payout of more than $26 billion is finalized, according to company filings.<br />The drug distributors  McKesson Corp. ,  AmerisourceBergen Corp.  and  Cardinal Health Inc.,  along with  Johnson & Johnson ,  plan to deduct the payouts from their taxes, filings show.<br />Cardinal, which expects to pay $6.6 billion as part of the settlement, said in a regulatory filing earlier this month that it anticipates receiving a $943 million tax benefit as a result of losses it incurred because of the payout charge. The company said it has filed for an income tax refund it expects to receive in the next 12 months.<br />Cardinal, based in Dublin, Ohio, said $420 million of the benefit would come from offsetting profits from prior tax years when there was a higher corporate income-tax rate, taking advantage of a provision created by Congress as part of its Covid-19 economic-relief package last March<br />“We recorded a net operating loss for tax purposes in our second quarter, which, as permissible under current federal law, will be carried back to recover previously paid federal taxes,” a Cardinal spokeswoman said in an email."
