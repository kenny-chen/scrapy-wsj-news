    "body": "TEL AVIV—Israel will vaccinate Palestinian laborers who work in Israel and in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Israel’s military said Sunday. The move comes as Israel has faced pressure to vaccinate Palestinians who live under Israeli control.<br />The program was approved Sunday by Israel’s political leaders and will begin in the coming days, according to the arm of Israel’s defense ministry that coordinates with the Palestinians.<br />Israel is running the world’s fastest vaccine drive, with over 50% of its population receiving one shot of the vaccine and more than one-third fully inoculated, almost exclusively with the  Pfizer Inc.  vaccine. The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority has been much slower than Israel in organizing a vaccination campaign, and it will mostly rely on the Covax program led by the World Health Organization under which it will receive vaccines for 60% of its population.<br />Israel will establish vaccination sites at crossings between Israel and the West Bank and in industrial zones in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Israeli medical teams will operate the program and will administer  Moderna Inc.  vaccines to those with Israeli work papers. According to a security official, 87,000 Palestinians have permits to work in Israel and 35,000 have permits to work in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank.<br />The military said the effort aims to “maintain public health and the functioning of the economy.”"
