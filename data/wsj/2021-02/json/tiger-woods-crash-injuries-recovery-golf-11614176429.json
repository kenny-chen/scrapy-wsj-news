    "body": "As Tiger Woods recovers from serious leg injuries suffered in a rollover accident Tuesday morning outside Los Angeles, the golf world is again trying to answer the question that has loomed over the sport for the better part of a decade.<br />Is Tiger done?<br />Woods underwent emergency surgery after he fractured bones in multiple places in the accident. He had a rod, screws and pins inserted to stabilize his leg, foot and ankle. He experienced trauma to his leg’s muscle and soft tissue.<br />The question of his golf future is difficult to answer because relatively little is known about his precise condition and so few athletes in history are even vaguely comparable to him.<br />It’s also not the first time Woods has faced such questions. They surfaced beginning in 2008, when knee surgeries derailed his career, and 2009, when he crashed an SUV into a fire hydrant and a tree amid what became an ugly public marital scandal. He suffered numerous other injuries over the ensuing years, including to his back and Achilles."
