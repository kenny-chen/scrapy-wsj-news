    "body": "The pandemic has dealt a tough hand to kids and their parents, with social isolation, distance learning and the constant threat of illness. Child and adolescent psychiatrist Harold S. Koplewicz says even small steps can help parents foster resilience and self-reliance in their children.<br />Dr. Koplewicz, the president and medical director of the Child Mind Institute in New York and California, lays out his parenting approach in “The Scaffold Effect,” which is being published today. Parents, he says, should think of their role as that of a scaffold for a building under construction: their child. The scaffold doesn’t control the shape or style of the building and it eases its support as the structure rises.<br />Here are edited excerpts from an interview:<br />Many families are struggling during the pandemic. How does parenting need to change?<br />Self-care is so essential. Self-care is child care, particularly during Covid. Covid requires us to make sure we are doing some exercise, that we are sleeping, having a little fun every once in a while."
