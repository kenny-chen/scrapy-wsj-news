    "body": "Cloud-communications company  Twilio Inc.  is in talks to invest as much as $750 million in Syniverse Technologies LLC in a precursor to a public listing for the private-equity-owned messaging company, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The investment, to be announced Monday, could be followed in the coming months by a merger between Syniverse and a special-purpose acquisition company, some of the people said. Such a deal could value Syniverse, owned by private-equity firm  Carlyle Group Inc.,  at around $2 billion to $3 billion including debt, they said. There is no guarantee that Syniverse will pull off a listing, either through a SPAC deal or a traditional IPO.<br />Should it go public through a SPAC, it would be the latest in a recent string of such deals as more companies seek an alternative to a traditional IPO. SPACs go public without a business and then look for one to merge with, and the resulting transaction provides the target with a listing.<br />Crucially for Syniverse, the Twilio deal involves a commercial arrangement that would send a significant amount of business its way, the people said. Syniverse may also use proceeds from a SPAC deal to make acquisitions.<br />Syniverse provides roaming, messaging and other telecommunications services for mobile operators and other businesses. Since 2011 it has been owned by Carlyle."
