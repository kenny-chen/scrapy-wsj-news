See a recent profile of Daniel Kaluuya, an actor whose profile has risen through a string of noteworthy films, including “Judas and the Black Messiah” (now streaming on HBO Max).<br />Here’s what is streaming this week:<br />(HBO Max)<br />Aside from being a world-famous musician, Sir Elton John has devoted much of his advocacy work to the Elton John AIDS Foundation, which he founded in 1992. Here, he recommends ‘It’s a Sin,” a limited series that chronicles the early days of the epidemic in the U.K. All five episodes begin streaming Thursday on HBO Max. Edited from an interview.<br />“Russell T Davies, who has written so many wonderful things—from ‘Queer as Folk’ to ‘Doctor Who’—has written a new series called ‘It’s a Sin’ that’s set among a group of gay men in the early ‘80s and the start of the AIDS epidemic in Britain. I was wondering how they were going to do it and they did it more than brilliantly. It was so accurate. It was so moving."
