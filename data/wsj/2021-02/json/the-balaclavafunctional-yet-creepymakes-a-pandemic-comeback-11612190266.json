    "body": "DURING AMERICA’S first winter in the era of widespread face coverings, the curious and sometimes menacing balaclava has surged in popularity. In December, the outdoor emporium REI saw year-over-year sales of the slinky, ninja-evoking items spike 40% and niche retailers and craftspeople have been quickly selling out of small-batch versions for the past couple months. (For anyone who needs a refresher, balaclavas encase one’s head, except for openings that leave the eyes—and less often the mouth—visible.)<br />Boosting the zeistgeisty design’s visibility, raffish sorts like the rapper Fabolous and the NBA’s Russell Westbrook have been photographed recently with their faces cloaked in ski masks (Mr. Westbrook’s was a $50 number from his own fashion label, Honor the Gift.) And it’s worth mentioning that RMR, a sultry singer who wears a black balaclava at all times to cloak his identity, has been fueling the surge since he emerged last February in a viral music video.<br />It would seem these “mug for the camera” stars are tapping into the imposing balaclava’s cool factor. But for your average errand-runner, pulling on a knit balaclava is a purely practical move. Not only does it keep you warm, some treat a mouth-concealing balaclava as a face mask in a pinch when rushing to the post office. Yet a knitted balaclava offers less protection from airborne viruses than an N95 or even a taut cloth mask researchers say. Conscientious adopters of the trend wear a proper face mask beneath their balaclava.<br />Of course, keeping people toasty in sub-zero climes is the ski mask’s original raison d’etre. “In Winnipeg, it’s really, really freaking cold in the winter. So [balaclavas] definitely serve a purpose,” said Shawnee Isaak, 29, a gardener in the notoriously frigid Canadian province of Manitoba who began crafting her own balaclavas this winter. Like many at-home knitters, Ms. Isaak first learned how to stitch by studying YouTube videos. This winter she’s been perfecting her skills—she can now run off a ski mask in about five hours rather than the two days it used to take.<br />With more folks escaping outside this winter to shake off Covid containment boredom, the insulating balaclava is more welcome than ever. Gillian Stadelman, the senior merchandising strategist at REI, noted that sales of gear for “socially distanced” outdoor sports like snowshoeing and cross-country skiing are up as much as 300% year over year. She sees the outdoor outfitter’s balaclava bump as part of the same dynamic. More customers are looking to safely get their fitness in outdoors, and they’re dressing the part in full-face ski masks."
