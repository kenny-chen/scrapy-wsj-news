    "body": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny faces a court hearing Tuesday in which prosecutors have requested that a suspended sentence he received in 2014 be turned into real prison time. Russian authorities say Mr. Navalny repeatedly violated the terms of his parole, including when he was recuperating in Germany after he was poisoned.<br />Prosecutors made their request when Mr. Navalny was abroad. The opposition leader says it was meant to deter him from returning to Russia, where he had promised to resume his campaign against President Vladimir Putin.<br />Alexei Navalny is Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, a fierce anticorruption activist who has managed to galvanize Russia’s political opposition by exposing flaws in the more than 20-year rule of Mr. Putin.<br />Mr. Navalny first dove into politics as part of a broader ethnic Russian nationalist movement. But in 2012, he pivoted to become part of a wider coalition of opposition groups that sought to lead protests against Mr. Putin’s decision to return as president after serving for four years as prime minister.<br />Mr. Navalny is a skilled speaker who rouses crowds with ease, but his real weapon is his YouTube channel that gives him a nationwide platform to reach nearly 4 million subscribers and urge them to protest in the streets of Moscow and other big cities."
