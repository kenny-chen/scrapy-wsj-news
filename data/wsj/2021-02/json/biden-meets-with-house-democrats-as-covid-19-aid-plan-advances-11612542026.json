    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House approved a budget bill advancing President Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief plan, as Mr. Biden met with top House Democrats and lawmakers dived into crafting the details of the relief package.<br />The 219-209 vote marked a further step under budget reconciliation, a process that would allow Democrats to pass the relief package without Republican support in the Senate. Now, Democrats will turn to ironing out the details of the package over several weeks, including deciding who will be eligible for $1,400 direct payments and whether or not to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.<br />During the meeting at the White House, House committee leaders presented on various elements of the bill. Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the group discussed who should receive the $1,400 direct payments in Mr. Biden’s plan. Mr. Biden has indicated he is open to more narrowly targeting the checks.<br />The latest employment report showed the labor market remained weak, with the U.S. economy adding 49,000 jobs in January after payrolls fell steeply in December. Mr. Biden said he hoped for backing from some Republicans on the aid bill, but again indicated Democrats would move ahead without bipartisan support.<br />“There are some really fine people who want to get something done. But they’re just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go.”"
