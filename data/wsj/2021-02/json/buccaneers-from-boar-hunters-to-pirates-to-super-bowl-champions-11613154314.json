Read previous columns here.<br />When the Tampa Bay Buccaneers celebrated their Super Bowl victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, they did so in a style befitting their name: with a rowdy boat parade.<br />In Wednesday’s nautical celebration, a flotilla of boats carried Tom Brady and his carousing teammates along the Hillsborough River near downtown Tampa to the city’s port. The procession resembled Tampa’s annual Gasparilla Pirate Festival commemorating the legendary pirate José Gaspar, known as “the Last of the Buccaneers.”<br />The team’s name brings to mind romantic images of swashbucklers on the high seas. But the origins of the term go back to hunters grilling the meat of wild animals in the Caribbean.<br />When Europeans began colonizing Latin America, they incorporated many indigenous practices. One was slow-roasting meat over a fire using a wooden framework. In Taíno, spoken on several Caribbean islands, this cooking method was called “barbacoa,” which was borrowed into Spanish and eventually gave rise to the English word “barbecue.”"
