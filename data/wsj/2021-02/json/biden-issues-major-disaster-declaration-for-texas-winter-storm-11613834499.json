    "body": "President Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Texas on Saturday after winter storms wreaked havoc on the state, creating a power and utility crisis.<br />The White House said the federal assistance would cover 77 counties and provide grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other recovery aid to individuals and business owners.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Friday that the initial focus of the disaster aid would be for Texas counties most affected by the storms.<br />Access to safe drinking water remained a critical issue for millions in the state. But after a week of frigid temperatures that were linked to the deaths of at least 69 people, according to the Associated Press, weather conditions continued to improve in Texas on Saturday, with most of the state seeing highs in the 40s and 50s.<br />Power outages were also considerably better, with nearly 58,000 households and businesses still without electricity on Saturday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us, a site that tracks records and aggregates U.S. power outages."
