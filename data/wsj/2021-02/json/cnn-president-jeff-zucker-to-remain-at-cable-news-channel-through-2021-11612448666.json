    "body": "CNN President Jeff Zucker will depart the cable news channel at the end of 2021, when his contract expires, network parent WarnerMedia said, ending months of uncertainty about the network’s leadership.<br />Mr. Zucker, who has run CNN for eight years, signaled internally in recent months that he wasn’t sure he would stay through his current contract. He was unhappy about how his boss, WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar, had surprised him with a reorganization of the company’s executive ranks, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />The two executives have since patched up those disagreements, according to a person familiar with their relationship, who called the disputes growing pains.<br />“It’s great to have Jeff steering all things CNN in 2021,” Mr. Kilar said in a statement. “As I’ve said before, in my opinion, the two best things to happen to CNN have been Ted Turner and Jeff Zucker.”<br />Since Mr. Zucker didn’t agree to stay at the network beyond this year, WarnerMedia will soon need to contemplate who will fill his role."
