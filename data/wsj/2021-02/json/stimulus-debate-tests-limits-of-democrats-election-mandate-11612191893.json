    "body": "President Biden and his Democratic Party face a big decision this week, on whether to start trying to push into law a larger coronavirus stimulus bill on their own, or a smaller one with some Republican support.<br />Behind that decision lies an even bigger question: How much of a mandate did Democrats win in November’s election?<br />Mr. Biden and his team are pressing, as a matter of utmost urgency, a $1.9 trillion plan to speed coronavirus vaccinations and help cities, states and the overall economy get past the virus’ economic stranglehold. A group of 10 Republican senators has countered with a much smaller, $618 billion proposal that essentially keeps intact the Biden plan’s funds for vaccination work, shrinks some of the economic stimulus pieces and jettisons others entirely.<br />The Republicans’ proposal leaves the president standing between his two main opening-round promises: to take fast and big action on the virus, and to foster more bipartisanship in Washington.<br />The sentiment among many rank-and-file Democrats is clear. They argue that the size and urgency of the coronavirus package calls for steaming past Republican efforts to slow and shrink the plan and using whatever measures they have at their disposal to pass it, with only Democratic votes if necessary. They fear Republicans will force a downsizing of the package in negotiations, and then oppose it in the end anyway."
