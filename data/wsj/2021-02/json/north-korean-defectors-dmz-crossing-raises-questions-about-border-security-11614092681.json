    "body": "SEOUL—A North Korean defector swam south across the border, slipped through a drainage conduit, popped up on military cameras eight times and strolled down a barricaded road. Alarms blared twice.<br />This all transpired last week before the man was detected on camera by South Korea’s military, triggering an hourslong manhunt.<br />The six-hour saga after the man crossed one of the world’s most fortified borders—the Korean demilitarized zone—was detailed in a briefing Tuesday for local media by Seoul’s military.<br />South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, which has conducted a probe into the border breach, declined to comment to The Wall Street Journal.<br />The incident ignited criticism by South Korean lawmakers and military experts over how well the country’s soldiers are monitoring a border that is about 150 miles long and more than 2 miles wide."
