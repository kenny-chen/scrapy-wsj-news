    "body": "President Biden took office promising to address the coronavirus pandemic with plans that included a swifter nationwide rollout of vaccines and a focus on getting them to minority and lower-income people who have been hit hard by Covid-19.<br />As new variants increase the urgency for vaccinations, competing pressures are testing his administration’s capacity to accomplish both goals at once.<br />The Biden administration has said it wants to notch 100 million vaccinations in its first 100 days, has increased its weekly vaccine supply to states to at least 10.5 million doses, and is buying enough doses to inoculate most of the U.S. population by the end of the summer.<br />At the same time, the administration is launching a plan to send about one million vaccines a week to pharmacies that initially will be selected based on proximity to minority and underserved communities, where people have been hit harder than the broader population.<br />These communities have populations that traditionally highly distrust medical treatments and broadly have less access to everything from the digital technology needed to book appointments to easy transportation to vaccination centers."
