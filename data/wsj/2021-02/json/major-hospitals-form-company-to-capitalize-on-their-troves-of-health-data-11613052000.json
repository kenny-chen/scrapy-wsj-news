    "body": "A group of major hospital systems is launching a company to pull together and sell access to anonymized data on their millions of patients for uses including research and drug development.<br />Among the 14 backers of Truveta Inc. are hospital owners including Providence, CommonSpirit Health, Advocate Aurora Health, Trinity Health and  Tenet Healthcare Corp.  The data held by Truveta won’t contain information identifying individual patients, the company said.<br />Demand from technology companies, insurers, drugmakers and others trying to develop new tools and treatments has created a gold rush in health data. Hospitals hold some of the richest repositories—detailed information on patients’ histories, care and conditions—and for years other companies have sought access.<br />“Instead of just farming off all our data to a technology company somewhere, we’ve formed our own,” said Rod Hochman, chief executive of Providence. The hospital systems will focus on research questions around health equity, as well as improving medical treatment, he said.<br />The new company’s data will reflect around 13% of the clinical care provided in the U.S., a spokeswoman said, representing records for many millions of patients across 40 states. Truveta will be jointly owned by the hospital operators."
