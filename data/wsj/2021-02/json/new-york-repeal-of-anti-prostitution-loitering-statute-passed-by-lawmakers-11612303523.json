    "body": "ALBANY, N.Y.—New York state lawmakers on Tuesday repealed the offense of loitering for the purposes of prostitution, which advocates said has been used to harass people based on their gender expression.<br />Democrats, who dominate both the state Assembly and Senate, passed the measure largely along party lines, saying the law has been used to criminalize “walking while trans.” Several Republicans said the law, which was enacted in 1976, was a necessary tool for preventing prostitution.<br />Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the bill less than two hours later.<br />The existing law made it a violation for someone to remain or wander in a public place, beckoning or stopping people or vehicles for the purpose of prostitution. The number of people primarily charged with the offense has declined in the past 10 years to six in 2020 from 882 in 2010, according to the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services.<br />Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz, a Democrat from Queens, said she has transgender friends who were stopped by police “because of how they look and because they fit a certain profile.” She said she had been detained by police three times while walking in her home borough late at night, under suspicion of engaging in prostitution."
