    "body": "Corteva Inc.  forecast a big increase in profits for the year ahead as the agriculture giant faces pressure from an activist investor to improve its results.<br />The crop seed and pesticide maker on Wednesday said it expects operating earnings to rise 15% to 20% in the year ahead, slightly ahead of analysts’ projections, as surging crop prices and agricultural exports improve farmers’ fortunes. Early seed sales to North American farmers and fall pesticide spraying helped Corteva deliver a small profit for the fourth quarter, which analysts had anticipated to show a loss.<br />The Delaware-based farm supplier is under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP. The firm in January launched an effort to oust Corteva’s chief executive, Jim Collins, and replace most of the company’s board of directors. Starboard said Corteva’s profits have been stagnant and that Mr. Collins hasn’t acted decisively to change that.<br />Corteva’s board has stood behind Mr. Collins. The board in January acknowledged the company can improve its performance for investors, and is making progress, but said Starboard hadn’t offered specifics.<br />“We’re at a real inflection point,” Mr. Collins said in an interview. “There’s a lot of good work that’s gone on over the last few years, that folks don’t appreciate how ready we are to deliver.”"
