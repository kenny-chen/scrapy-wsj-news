    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Capitol Police said they are investigating the actions of dozens of officers in the Jan. 6 riot by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, ahead of a planned Senate hearing next week featuring testimony from police and security officials.<br />The Capitol Police’s Office of Professional Responsibility is probing the actions of 35 officers as part of its investigation into the force’s response, and the force has suspended six of them with pay as of Friday, according to a spokesman for the police force.<br />Acting Chief Yogananda D. Pittman “has directed that any member of her department whose behavior is not in keeping with the Department’s Rules of Conduct will face appropriate discipline,” said John Stolnis, a spokesman for USCP.<br />Several congressional committees are also probing the security failures during the attack, and a pair of Senate committees will hold a hearing on Tuesday with officials involved in Capitol security. A House committee will hold a hearing next week with the acting Capitol Police chief and acting House Sergeant at Arms.<br />Lawmakers and other Capitol Police officers have questioned why the force was so unprepared for the attack. In a closed-door hearing last month, acting Chief Pittman said that by Jan. 4 the Capitol Police saw that the rally carried “strong potential for violence,” with extremists likely to attend. The force was still quickly overwhelmed."
