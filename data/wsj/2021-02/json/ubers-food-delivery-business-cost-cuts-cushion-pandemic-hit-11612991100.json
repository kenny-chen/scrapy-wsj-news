    "body": "Uber Technologies Inc.  posted a narrower annual loss on the back of its food-delivery business and aggressive cost cuts, even as the coronavirus pandemic crushed its core ride-hailing operations.<br />The San Francisco-based company on Wednesday reported a net loss of $6.76 billion for 2020, compared with a loss of $8.5 billion the year before. While widespread shelter-in-place orders crippled Uber’s rides business, its food-delivery arm thrived as the same mandates kept people from going to restaurants. Revenue for the year declined 14% to $11.13 billion.<br />Uber overhauled its business during the health crisis, cutting a quarter of its staff and shedding noncore businesses, among other moves, leading to $1 billion in savings on fixed expenses last year.<br />The company’s fourth-quarter revenue declined 16% to $3.16 billion. The net loss for the period narrowed to $968 million from $1.09 billion in the year-earlier quarter.<br />Uber’s adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization also narrowed in the latest quarter to $454 million, compared with a loss of $615 million a year earlier. Uber has said it expects to become profitable by this measure by the end of this year."
