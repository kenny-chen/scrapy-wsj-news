    "body": "SERRANA, Brazil—As Covid-19 has raged across Brazil, killing close to a quarter of a million people, high infection rates have turned the country into the perfect testing ground for vaccines.<br />Now, Brazil is using its misfortune to help answer one of the pandemic’s most pressing questions as millions are being inoculated worldwide: Can someone who is vaccinated still transmit the virus?<br />In the first experiment of its kind globally, researchers Wednesday began a project to vaccinate the entire adult population of Serrana, a hard-hit commuter town of 45,000 people in São Paulo state, before the rest of the country.<br />They say the results will help the world’s scientists understand how quickly vaccines can curb the coronavirus pandemic. And vaccinating an entire town will counter Brazil’s growing anti-vax movement and demonstrate the wider benefits of mass immunization, such as a quick economic recovery expected with a fast reopening of Serrana.<br />“It will give us information about the percentage of people who need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity—no one knows this yet,” said Marcos Borges, a professor of medicine at the University of São Paulo in nearby Ribeirão Preto who is leading the study."
