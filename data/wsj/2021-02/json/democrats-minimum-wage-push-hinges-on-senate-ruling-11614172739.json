    "body": "WASHINGTON—A decision on whether raising the minimum wage as part of President Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief package is acceptable under the Senate’s rules is expected as soon as Wednesday, kicking off what could be a fraught negotiation among Democrats on the provision.<br />Staff for both Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans are set to meet Wednesday morning with Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough over the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, a plank of Mr. Biden’s relief plan.<br />Democrats are using a process called reconciliation to pass the aid package with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation. But reconciliation also comes with Senate rules on what proposals can be approved under the special procedure—including that the provision be directly tied to the budget. The nonpartisan parliamentarian will hear arguments from both parties and is expected to make a ruling on Wednesday or Thursday on the question.<br />A favorable ruling from the parliamentarian on raising the minimum wage through reconciliation will open the door for lawmakers to increase the federal minimum wage for the first time since 2009. But then Democrats will have to agree on exactly how to do so.<br />“It will be a whole caucus discussion because you still have to have 50 votes,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), a proponent of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, said."
