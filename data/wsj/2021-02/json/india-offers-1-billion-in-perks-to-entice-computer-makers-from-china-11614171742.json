    "body": "NEW DELHI—India announced close to $1 billion in incentives to persuade companies to make more computers within India, hoping to shrink its trade deficit and attract manufacturers trying to diversify away from production in China.<br />India’s cabinet Wednesday approved a rewards program for companies that expand local production of laptops, tablets and other computers. New Delhi said it would give companies cash equal to up to 4% of the value of their sales, depending on how much they increase domestic production over the four years starting April.<br />“Our focus is to bring the world’s top five global champions to India and produce for the world,” Ravi Shankar Prasad, minister for electronics and information technology, told a news conference. “Before announcing the incentives, we have had discussions with key manufacturers. They are just waiting.”<br />Indian authorities are already discussing the new incentives with  Apple Inc.  which has yet to start making laptops or tablets in India, as well as  HP Inc.  which has a presence in India, said one government official.<br />A spokesman for Apple India didn’t respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday, HP didn’t respond to an email seeking comment."
