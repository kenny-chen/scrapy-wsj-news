    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Cuomo Covid Coverup” (Feb. 13) concerning the coverup of the nursing-home Covid deaths: Top aide Melissa DeRosa in effect has admitted that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s team was afraid the opposition would make political hay of the revelation. Of course they would. The Democrats have politicized the virus from the moment President Trump closed our airports to Chinese flights (picture Nancy Pelosi dancing on the streets of Chinatown). Gov. Cuomo, sometime media darling, isn’t used to being called out, especially by members of his own party.<br />Jim Barber<br />Mesa, Ariz.<br /><br />Your editorial rightly mentions the underreporting of nursing-home deaths from Covid-19 in New York state. The real scandal, however, is that most of these deaths were avoidable."
