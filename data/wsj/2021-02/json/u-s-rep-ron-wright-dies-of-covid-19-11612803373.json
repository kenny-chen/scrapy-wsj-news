    "body": "Rep. Ron Wright (R., Texas) died Sunday after contracting Covid-19, according to his campaign office, becoming the first member of Congress to die from the coronavirus while in office.<br />Mr. Wright’s death at the age of 67 came two weeks after he was admitted to Baylor Hospital in Dallas, his campaign said. He said on Jan. 21 that he had tested positive for Covid-19 after coming into contact with someone who was infected. He was also being treated for cancer, his office said.<br />“Despite years of painful, sometimes debilitating treatment for cancer, Ron never lacked the desire to get up and go to work, to motivate those around him, or to offer fatherly advice,” his campaign said Monday.<br />Mr. Wright was starting his second term in Congress. He previously served as a member of the Arlington, Texas, City Council and as chief of staff for former Rep. Joe Barton, a fellow Texas Republican who previously represented the district, south of Dallas.<br />Mr. Wright hadn’t received the Covid-19 vaccine, his spokesman said. It wasn’t immediately known why the lawmaker hadn’t been vaccinated."
