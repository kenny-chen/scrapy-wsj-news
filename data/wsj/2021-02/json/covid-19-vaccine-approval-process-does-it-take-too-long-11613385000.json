    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration will convene an independent panel of experts Feb. 26 to recommend whether the  Johnson & Johnson  Covid-19 vaccine should be authorized for use in the U.S.<br />The hearing comes 22 days after J&J submitted its application and supporting test data. That’s on par with the timetable the FDA set for review of the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and partner  BioNTech SE ,  but nearly a week longer than the one for the vaccine from  Moderna Inc.  Both were approved in December.<br />Some readers have questioned the amount of time needed to convene these review panels amid a global crisis and the urgent need to get vaccines distributed. Here’s a look at some of the issues involved:<br />FDA officials say they need the time to review the vaccine test data submitted by the company and make sure the conclusions are accurate. As part of that review, FDA scientists scrutinize data from individual study volunteers, paying close attention to those who have had side effects and to differences between various demographic groups.<br />The time frame is still much shorter than the usual FDA review of proposed new drugs and vaccines, which normally takes months."
