It will continue to air in its regular noon to 3 p.m. time slot Monday through Friday.<br />Mr. Limbaugh died Wednesday at age 70 from complications from lung cancer, his wife Kathryn Rogers announced on his radio show yesterday.<br />“No one can replace Rush Limbaugh,” said Hosea Belcher, senior vice president of affiliate marketing for iHeartMedia Inc.’s Premiere Networks. “Our plan is to provide the millions of loyal listeners with the voice of Rush Limbaugh for long term.”<br />Mr. Limbaugh’s 30 years of audio has been archived and cataloged by subject, topic and opinion, Premiere said in its memo. The show will address the day’s news using relevant clips and guest hosts such as Mark Steyn, Todd Herman and Ken Matthews, who helped fill in while Mr. Limbaugh underwent cancer treatment over the past year, will help guide the show from segment to segment, the network said."
