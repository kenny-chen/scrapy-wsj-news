    "body": "A combination of two  Eli Lilly  & Co. antibody-based drugs to treat recently diagnosed Covid-19 was authorized by federal health regulators, the latest treatment aimed to help people at high risk of severe disease from avoiding hospitalization.<br />The move by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday night allows doctors to add a new monoclonal antibody, named etesevimab, to one called bamlanivimab that the agency authorized last year.<br />The combination, administered together via a single intravenous infusion, is cleared for patients who are at high risk of worsening to severe Covid-19 including those 65 and older or who have certain medical conditions.<br />Monoclonal antibodies are engineered proteins that mimic the immune systemâ€™s ability to fight off viruses.  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.  makes a similar antibody-based Covid-19 treatment that previously received FDA authorization.<br />Companies are developing Covid-19 antibody treatments that are more convenient to take and can tackle emerging virus mutations."
