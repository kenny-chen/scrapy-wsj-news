    "body": "The recent frenzy over  GameStop ,  AMC and other so-called meme stocks led to unprecedented margin calls from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., which clears and settles U.S. stock trades. The mania also broadly disrupted retail trading. As the dust settles, many investors are asking: Why does the transfer of ownership, or settlement, for most securities transactions in the U.S. occur two business days after the trade date, or T+2?<br />This is 2021. Why haven’t we already moved to T+1 or T+0?<br />A previously arcane subject—the securities transaction-settlement cycle—is now top of mind. Determining how long the cycle should be involves walking the fine line between making the system more efficient and allowing slack to correct potential errors.<br />U.S. securities markets may now be ready to benefit from technological and operational advancements in back-office administrative functions and move to a shorter cycle, but that determination can’t be made without additional evidence and cooperation from market participants, regulators and investors.<br />The time to re-evaluate the length of the securities-transaction cycle is now, while memories of the GameStop debacle are fresh."
