    "body": "When the city of Tonghua in China’s northeast shut residents in their homes in response to new coronavirus cases in January, it forced a reckoning with some harsh economic realities in the aging rust-belt city.<br />Thousands complained on social media that they were running out of necessities such as food and medicine. It was the kind of hardship that hadn’t been seen since the lockdown of Wuhan for the first Covid-19 outbreak a year earlier. As many pleaded that they were starving, saying “Don’t forget us,” city officials apologized and said they were short-handed.<br />The city of around 2 million, near the North Korean border, is one of many in the northeast that have fallen on hard times as China has restructured its overbuilt steel industry. Growth is markedly slower and many younger people have left in search of work.<br />Nearly one in four residents in Tonghua is 60 years old or older, compared with a national average of about 18%, official data show. The city now has less money coming in while also having more retirees to support—fault lines that became more obvious in its draconian pandemic response.<br />Last year, Tonghua only reported six cases of Covid-19. But in January, after at least 49 residents who had visited a center selling health-care products for the elderly tested positive, a downtown section of the city became the most locked-down place in China. City officials taped apartment doors shut in entire housing complexes practically overnight."
