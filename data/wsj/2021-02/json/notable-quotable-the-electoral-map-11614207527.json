    "body": "Michael Baronewriting for the Washington Examiner, Feb. 24:<br /><br />Eleven of the 20 districts where Republicans suffered the greatest percentage losses [between 2012 and 2020] now have Democratic House members, even though all but one easily elected Republicans for years. Similarly, 11 of the 20 districts where Republicans have made the greatest percentage gains now have Republican congressmen, although only five have a solidly Republican heritage.<br />The partisan strife of the last decade has failed to produce either [a] Democratic majority [or] the less-frequently-projected MAGA nation. But it has shown both parties capable of adapting to unforeseen challenges. And it has produced the most robust voter turnout in more than a century."
