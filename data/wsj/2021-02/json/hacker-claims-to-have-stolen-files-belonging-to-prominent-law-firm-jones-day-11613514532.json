    "body": "A hacker claims to have stolen files belonging to the global law firm Jones Day and posted many of them on the dark web.<br />Jones Day has many prominent clients, including former President Donald Trump and major corporations.<br />Jones Day, in a statement, disputed that its network has been breached. The statement said that a file-sharing company that it has used was recently compromised and had information taken. Jones Day said it continues to investigate the breach and will continue to be in discussion with affected clients and appropriate authorities.<br />The posting by a person who self-identified as the hacker, which goes by the name Clop, includes a few individual documents that are easily reviewed by the public, including by The Wall Street Journal. One memo is to a judge and is marked “confidential mediation brief,” another is a cover letter for enclosed “confidential documents.” The Journal couldn’t immediately confirm their authenticity.<br />The Journal was able to see the existence of many more files—mammoth in size—also purported to belong to Jones Day, posted by the hacker on the so-called dark web. Hackers typically post such stolen information after the hacked entity fails to pay a ransom. The Journal was able to contact the hacker using an email on its blog."
