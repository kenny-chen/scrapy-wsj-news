    "body": "BERLIN—A German court secured the world’s first conviction of a former Syrian official in relation to state-sanctioned torture in what lawyers and human-rights groups hailed as a breakthrough in the effort to bring the regime to account.<br />The court Wednesday found Eyad al-Gharib, a 44-year-old former Syrian regime officer, guilty of aiding and abetting crimes against humanity, sentencing him to 4½ years in prison for helping to suppress opposition activity after the 2011 antigovernment uprising against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.<br />While Mr. Gharib’s crimes took place in Syria, prosecutors invoked the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of war crimes regardless of where they are committed.<br />“Germany has opened the road to justice for Syrians,” said Joumana Seif, Syrian human-rights lawyer and research fellow at the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, which is representing some of the former detainees who are plaintiffs in the case.<br />“This is the first time that Assad’s crimes are being presented in front of a court,” she said."
