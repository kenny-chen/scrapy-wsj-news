    "body": "THERE WOULD be salad. This much Brandon Jew knew when he opened his restaurant Mister Jiu’s, back in 2016. “We have so much great produce here in the Bay Area,” he said. “It’s built into how we eat in San Francisco. And it’s built into my training as a chef.”<br />His first cookbook, “Mister Jiu’s in Chinatown: Recipes and Stories from the Birthplace of Chinese American Food,” co-authored with Tienlon Ho, comes out March 9. This recipe is a pared-down version of one included in the salad chapter. Mr. Jew calls for scattering sweet mandarin segments across a platter and topping them with shaved fennel, tarragon and salty Marcona almonds. The dressing is a revelation, a mix of olive oil, vinegar, toasted anise seeds and a surprising creamy element: almond milk. “It works like buttermilk,” Mr. Jew said. At the restaurant he uses a house-made “milk” made from apricot kernels, but a good store-bought almond milk works just fine here.<br />Though a salad like this one might not immediately register as the sort of Chinese American classic Mr. Jew features on his menu, this recipe still speaks to his memories of eating at Chinese restaurants as a child. “For dessert it was almond Jell-O with fruit cocktail,” he said. “These flavors remind me of that.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page."
