    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Reality Check for a $15 Minimum Wage” (Feb. 9): Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would greatly hurt the economy, and the young and underqualified will be the ones to suffer if this is enacted.<br />I have been employed by a nonprofit gymnastics association for the past five years (since I was 14). As a student instructor (until high-school graduation) I made $7.25 an hour. An organization like the one I work for employs mostly students ages 14-18. Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would result in a reduction of staff, so much so that the services we provide wouldn’t be able to adequately be performed, ultimately leading to the demise of the organization.<br />Many of the employment opportunities my college-student peers and I seek are part-time and require little to no experience. These opportunities will disappear if the minimum wage is increased to $15 per hour. With that in mind, it is likely that America will see a decrease in employment and increase in poverty among young adults and inexperienced workers.<br />For the sake of the small businesses and the young and inexperienced workers, the proposal of a $15 per hour minimum wage needs to be fought and ultimately rejected.<br />Leah Bookser"
