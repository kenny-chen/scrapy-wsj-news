    "body": "Investors’ thirst for yield in debt markets is driving demand for the risky loans that fund private equity deals. That is allowing companies to begin testing new features designed to boost their green and governance credentials.<br />Klöckner Pentaplast, a European plastic packaging business owned by SVPGlobal, is asking investors for cuts to the interest it will pay on €1.175 billion of loans, equivalent to $1.4 billion, if the company hits targets related to diversity in its management ranks and use of recycled material, according to bankers and investors.<br />The loan refinancing is the first time a company has asked for interest-rate discounts, known as ratchets, linked to environmental, social or governance goals from U.S. investors.<br />A handful of European loans have sold with similar terms recently, according to bankers and investors. Another loan with ESG-linked interest discounts from French health care group Elsan is currently being marketed to European investors.<br />Concerns about climate change and diversity have raced up the finance and business agenda in recent years, reflecting growing demands from consumers for companies to show they are helping to tackle societal problems."
