    "body": "U.S. stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors awaited fresh comments from Jerome Powell a day after the Federal Reserve chairman soothed unsettled markets.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 inched up 0.1%.<br />Stock markets have wavered in recent days following a strong start to the year, with highflying tech companies leading declines. Investors said a rise in government bond yields, driven by improving growth prospects and rising inflation expectations, has accelerated a rotation out of the tech stocks that led markets higher during the pandemic, and into the stocks best placed to benefit from an end to lockdowns.<br />“This really is a function of economies reopening,” said Brian O’Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum Investment Funds. “Bond yields are rising because of good vaccination rates in the U.S. and U.K. and it’s prompting a simple rotation away from everything that did well last year, the stay-at-home stocks, to the ones that didn’t, the go-outside stocks.”<br />“It’s a good story in some ways, in that the market is trying to price in that economies are going to reopen,” he added."
