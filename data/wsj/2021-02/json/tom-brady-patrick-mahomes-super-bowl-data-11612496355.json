    "body": "TAMPA, Fla.—Tom Brady became the greatest quarterback of all-time by perfecting the way the position is played. He steps backward. He makes microscopic movements, seemingly with a sixth sense for pressure. Then he quickly unleashes the football.<br />Patrick Mahomes has become the greatest quarterback of the next generation by reinventing the precise art that Brady mastered. He throws on the run, goes off script and weaponizes the entire football field against the defense.<br />This Super Bowl between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs is a window into an evolution unfolding in the NFL. The most important position in football is transforming. And the two most transcendent players in the Super Bowl are at the beginning and end of it.<br />Tom Brady defined how to properly play quarterback. Mahomes revolutionized it. They’ve both won the Super Bowl because of that. On Sunday, they will play the same position on the same field in the same sport—and play it nothing like one another. They’re peers who aren’t peers.<br />“[Brady] probably is the standard by which young quarterbacks could judge themselves as far as a pocket passer is concerned,” said Tom House, who trains NFL quarterbacks including Brady. “Mahomes is the prototype of the new school quarterback, where they basically are runners who can pass—or passers who can run.”"
