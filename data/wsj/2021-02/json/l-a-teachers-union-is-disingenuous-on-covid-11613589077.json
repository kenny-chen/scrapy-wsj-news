    "body": "Regarding Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo’s “The ‘Universal Vaccination’ Chimera” (op-ed, Feb. 5): The suggestion by the Los Angeles Unified School District that it has the authority or power to require student vaccination for Covid is a red herring.<br />The district must know that Covid vaccines are not currently approved for use in children under 16. Thus, a vaccination requirement for enrollment is something that can’t now be realized.<br />There are ongoing clinical trials for ages 12 through 15, but those results are months away and will need to show efficacy. Until there is a valid pediatric clinical trial for children under 12, and the FDA gives an approval of said trial, there will be no vaccination of children. With no approved vaccine for children, there will be no in-person learning in Los Angeles public schools.<br />As cynical as it sounds, the vaccination of children for safety purposes is one more excuse by the teachers union to not do the jobs for which its members were hired.<br />Larry Clague"
