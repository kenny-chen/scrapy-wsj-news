    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday said it would review high-profile Trump administration policies on federal family-planning grants and income-based restrictions for immigration, even as the Biden administration is reconsidering those efforts.<br />In one case, the justices said they would consider the legality of Trump administration rules that prohibited federal family-planning grants to health clinics that offer on-site abortions or abortion referrals.<br />Lower courts have split on whether the Trump approach to the Title X family-planning program passes legal muster, and both his administration and its opponents had asked the Supreme Court to take up the issue.<br />In the immigration case, the Supreme Court said it would decide the legality of Trump administration rules that gave the government more latitude to deny U.S. residency or admission to people who use public-assistance programs or might rely on them in the future.<br />The court said it would hear an appeal filed by the Trump administration of a lower-court ruling in New York that said the Department of Homeland Security acted contrary to U.S. immigration law with its rules that expanded the pool of noncitizens it believed were likely to become a “public charge.”"
