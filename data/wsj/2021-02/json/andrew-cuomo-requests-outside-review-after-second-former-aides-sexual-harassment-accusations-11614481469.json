    "body": "A second former aide accused New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment, prompting the governor to announce that a former federal judge would conduct an outside review.<br />Mr. Cuomo said he requested the probe after the New York Times published an interview with his latest accuser, Charlotte Bennett, a former executive assistant and health-policy adviser in his administration.<br />In the Times interview, Ms. Bennett said on June 5, while she was alone in a meeting with Mr. Cuomo in his office in the state Capitol, he had asked her questions about her sex life. Ms. Bennett, 25 years old, said in the interview that Mr. Cuomo also said he was open to dating women in their 20s.<br />Ms. Bennett didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment on Saturday night.<br />She told the Times that a week after the alleged incident she shared what she said happened with Mr. Cuomo’s chief of staff, Jill DesRosiers. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Bennett was transferred from her role as an executive assistant to one as a health policy adviser, according to the interview with the Times. Ms. Bennet also told the Times that she spoke to Judith Mogul, the special counsel to the governor, about the incident."
