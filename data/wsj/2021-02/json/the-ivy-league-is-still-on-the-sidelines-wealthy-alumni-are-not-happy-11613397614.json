    "body": "Before Joe Tsai co-founded  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd . , made billions and bought the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets, he played lacrosse at Yale in the 1980s. His devotion to the sport grew along with his net worth, and recently he brought the two together in the form of an unusual offer.<br />Tsai offered to pay several million dollars for the Ivy League to build a sequestered “bubble” that would allow its men’s and women’s lacrosse teams to compete again during the pandemic. Ivy League conference presidents rebuffed the proposal almost immediately, conference executive director Robin Harris said.<br />It’s a sign of the fierce pressure the eight Ivy League universities are under as the conference heads into a possible second year without sports as the coronavirus pandemic drags on.<br />The Ivy League was the first conference to call off athletic competition back in March 2020. Nearly one year later, the conference is still on the sidelines with no clear plans to restart.<br />The extended pause that was once seen as prudent is now a point of contention."
