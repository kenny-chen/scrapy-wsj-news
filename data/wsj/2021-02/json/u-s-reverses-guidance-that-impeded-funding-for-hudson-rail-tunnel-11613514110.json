    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Transportation Department on Tuesday rescinded a Trump administration opinion that had effectively blocked federal funding for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River linking New Jersey and New York City.<br />The DOT’s Federal Transit Administration rescinded guidance issued in 2018, which effectively blocked project sponsors from counting funds borrowed from federal programs as part of the local share of a project’s financing.<br />New York and New Jersey have pledged $5.5 billion toward the $13 billion cost of the tunnel, but planned to borrow those funds from low-cost federal loan programs and pay them back over time.<br />The 2018 opinion stalled progress on the Gateway Program, a long-planned effort to construct a new two-track tunnel under the Hudson for Amtrak and NJ Transit commuter trains at the site of one of the worst bottlenecks on the Northeast Corridor.<br />New York and New Jersey officials were infuriated by the 2018 decision, which came as Donald Trump sought to thwart progress on the Hudson tunnel as a means of leverage over New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, then the minority leader, Trump administration officials have told the Journal."
