    "body": "In “The Senate’s Byrd Call” (Potomac Watch, Jan. 29), Kimberley A. Strassel defends the filibuster as a means of achieving bipartisanship, and she further argues against undermining the so-called Byrd rule, which places limits on the Senate’s use of budget reconciliation to circumvent the filibuster.<br />But the mere invocation of former Sen. Robert Byrd illustrates precisely why the filibuster should be done away with. Byrd infamously spoke for over 14 straight hours in a futile attempt to derail the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He presumably came to reject his regressive resistance to racial equality, but the example serves to illustrate that the point of the filibuster is not—and has never been—to achieve bipartisan consensus; it is instead a tool that aims to, and succeeds at, disempowering the majority.<br />In short, the filibuster is profoundly and effectively antidemocratic. For that very reason, it should be buried in the ash heap of history, regardless of which party controls the Senate.<br />Prof. David R. Dow<br />University of Houston Law Center"
