    "body": "A White House spokesman resigned on Saturday, after being put on unpaid leave for making threatening remarks to a reporter.<br />“We accepted the resignation of TJ Ducklo after a discussion with him this evening,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. “This conversation occurred with the support of the White House Chief of Staff.”<br />“We are committed to striving every day to meet the standard set by the President in treating others with dignity and respect, with civility and with a value for others through our words and our actions,” Ms. Psaki’s statement said.<br />The resignation follows a Vanity Fair article about a January exchange between Mr. Ducklo and Politico reporter Tara Palmeri regarding a story she was planning about Mr. Ducklo dating Axios reporter Alexi McCammond.<br />The one week suspension struck some as tepid, given President Biden had said in January that he would hold his staff to high standards of conduct."
