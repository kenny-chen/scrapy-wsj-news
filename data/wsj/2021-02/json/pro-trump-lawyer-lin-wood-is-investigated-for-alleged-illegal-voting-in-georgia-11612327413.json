    "body": "Georgia officials are investigating whether lawyer and pro-Trump activist L. Lin Wood may have voted illegally in Georgia while living in South Carolina, according to a senior staffer at the Georgia secretary of state’s office.<br />Georgia officials opened the investigation after a news report said that Mr. Wood said he had been living in South Carolina for several months, the staffer said. Mr. Wood voted in Georgia in the November general election, according to the Georgia secretary of state’s office.<br />“It’s a sham, and it’s a waste of taxpayer dollars,” Mr. Wood said in an interview. “Candidly, I come to the point that Georgia is so corrupt that I don’t want to be a citizen anymore.”<br />Mr. Wood was one of the most vocal figures who questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he alleged, without evidence, was stolen from former President Donald Trump. He sued unsuccessfully to block the certification of election results in Georgia.<br />No court, law-enforcement agency or election authority has found evidence of widespread fraud in the presidential election. Georgia election officials conducted two recounts, which confirmed that President Biden won the state in November."
