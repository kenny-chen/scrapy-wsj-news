    "body": "A silver lining from the Covid-19 pandemic has been improved focus on medical, public health and overall infrastructure to respond more effectively to global health crises. Tom Frieden (“The Next Pandemic Is Coming. Will We Be Ready?,” Review, Feb. 13) outlines six measures that will certainly expand on these improvements, when and if needed by 2023. Additionally, there are critical pre-emptive measures, focusing global surveillance on origins of viral transmission, that will significantly reduce such needs in the first place: We know that over 62% of human emerging diseases derive from zoonoses, a disproportionate number in selected taxa (particularly bats, carnivores, rodents), and in those species that geographically reside mainly in Asia, tropical Africa and latitudinal/longitudinal hot spot regions. Together with information about which populations of these species are closer in proximity to humans, a comprehensive global network will complement organizational changes and provide early warning signals to curtail the chances of future pandemics. Indeed, we must act now.<br />John L. Gittleman<br />Dean, Odum School of Ecology<br />University of Georgia<br />Athens, Ga."
