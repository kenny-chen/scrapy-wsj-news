    "body": "Aung San Suu Kyi has been remanded in custody for two weeks over allegations of having illegally imported walkie talkies, a spokesman for her political party said, two days after Myanmar’s military seized power from her civilian-run government in a coup.<br />She will remain in detention at her house in Naypyitaw, the nation’s capital, while authorities investigate, the spokesman, Win Htein, said.<br />The police document detailing the allegations was dated Feb. 1, when the country’s powerful military detained Ms. Suu Kyi in a predawn raid, hours before army-run television announced that the military chief had taken charge of the country. The obscure allegation was little more than a means to justify Ms. Suu Kyi’s detention, which shook the country and drew widespread global condemnation, experts and human-rights groups say.<br />The military and police didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />The coup marked a sudden reversal of Myanmar’s fragile transition from military rule to democracy, which began about a decade ago. Myanmar’s military claims elections held in November, which were won by Ms. Suu Kyi’s party in a landslide, were marred by voter fraud. Election officials have denied the claims."
