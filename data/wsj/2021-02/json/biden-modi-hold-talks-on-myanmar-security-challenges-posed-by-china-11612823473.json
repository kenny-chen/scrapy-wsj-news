    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, discussing regional security issues that revolve around China and the upheaval in Myanmar, the White House said.<br />The two leaders agreed to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, “including support for freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and a stronger regional architecture through the Quad,” the White House said in a statement about the call, referring to the four-nation group that also includes Japan and Australia.<br />Although China wasn’t mentioned by the White House, increased Chinese patrols around Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea last year steered the democracies toward heightened cooperation. The Quad reformed in 2017 in part to address a rising China.<br />The Chinese embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Indian government said in a statement the leaders “discussed at length regional developments and the wider geo-political context” and “reiterated the importance of working with like-minded countries to ensure a rules-based international order and a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.”<br />Messrs. Biden and Modi also discussed the upheaval in Myanmar as well as Covid-19 and climate change, according to the White House."
