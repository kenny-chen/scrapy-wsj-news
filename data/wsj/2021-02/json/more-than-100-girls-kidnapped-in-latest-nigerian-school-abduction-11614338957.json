By morning, community leaders were still working to tally the number of people missing.<br />Ahmad Abdullahi, a parent, said that his daughter had escaped, but that five of his nieces, between 14 and 17 years old, were among the missing.<br />The news marks the second such abduction in a little over a week in Nigeria’s northwest, where a surge in armed militancy has led to a worsening breakdown of security.<br />Dozens of schoolboys and staff are still missing after being kidnapped from another school, the Kagara Government Science College in Niger state on Feb. 17. Government officials have said they are negotiating with the kidnappers to bring the victims home."
