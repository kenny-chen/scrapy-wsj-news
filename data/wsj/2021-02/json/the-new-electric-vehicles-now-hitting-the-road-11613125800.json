    "body": "For car companies with big electric ambitions, 2021 is going to be a make or break year.<br />More than a dozen new electric-vehicle models are set to arrive in U.S. showrooms this year as Silicon Valley-inspired startups and established auto makers like General Motors Co. and  Volkswagen AG  show drivers the results of billions in spending on the technology.<br />For consumers, thatâ€™s going to mean more plug-in options on the new car lot than ever before. But whether car makers can persuade buyers to ditch fossil fuels for good is still uncertain.<br />Many challenges remain for electric vehicles: not enough places to charge, limited travel range and sticker prices that are still higher than similar rides powered by conventional gasoline engines. An existing federal tax credit worth $7,500 aims to help bridge the price gap and industry representatives have said they hope to expand the benefit through new legislation.<br />"
