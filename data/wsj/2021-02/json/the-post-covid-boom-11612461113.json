    "body": "Job growth at small U.S. firms continued in January, according to the latest employment survey from the National Federation of Independent Business. The NFIB report, due out later today, finds a continuing trend of revival from the worst of last spring’s Covid shutdowns. According to NFIB Chief Economist William Dunkelberg, job openings are plentiful and finding workers remains a challenge for small businesses:<br />In the meantime, continuing economic revival and the massive stimulus plans enacted in Washington last year are driving wages higher for employees at small firms. According to NFIB:<br />Today’s NFIB report is consistent with numerous other readings showing a healthy U.S. economy at businesses both large and small. And the good news is happenings across various sectors. The Journal’s Paul Hannon and Gwynn Guilford report that “ IHS Markit  said its U.S. services index was 58.3, up from 54.8 in December and the second-sharpest increase in almost six years.” The Journalists add:<br />As for hiring, NFIB isn’t the only one sharing encouraging news. The Journal’s Hannah Lang reports:<br />The latest data should give Americans hope that the economic revival that began last summer is set to continue."
