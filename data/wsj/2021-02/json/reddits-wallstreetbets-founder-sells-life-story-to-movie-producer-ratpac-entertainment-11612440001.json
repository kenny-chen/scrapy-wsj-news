    "body": "An internet misanthrope launches a message board for amateur stock pickers, gets kicked off and then watches from afar as this rogue community brings Wall Street to its knees.<br />That is the hot pitch that turned Jaime Rogozinski into the man every producer in Hollywood wanted to do business with. Earlier this week, the founder of Reddit’s WallStreetBets sold the rights to his life story to RatPac Entertainment, a production company known for backing hits like “Wonder Woman.”<br />A movie version of Mr. Rogozinski’s story will kick things off and then move on to podcasts and other mediums, RatPac producers say.<br />In exchange for a payment in the low six figures, Mr. Rogozinski has given exclusive access to RatPac producers—including the company’s head, Brett Ratner, a longtime Hollywood player who recently lost a major deal amid sexual-harassment accusations. They want to dramatize the story of his role in the WallStreetBets saga that has sent shares of struggling companies like  GameStop Corp.  surging, driven hedge funds to crippling losses and turned unlikely investors into big winners and losers.<br />Mr. Rogozinski is already talking with writers who RatPac is considering to write the feature film script."
