    "body": "The  GameStop  saga rattled a lot of people.<br />Hedge funds who shorted the stock were crushed as it soared 10-fold in five days. New buyers who were sucked in late by the prospect of quick profits then lost horribly, with the stock down 80% from its high. Even those who got in early can’t be happy to see so much of their newfound wealth evaporate. Trust in Wall Street, in the clearing system and in popular broker Robinhood have all been damaged, and opportunistic politicians from left and right have leapt on the moves to support their existing policy positions.<br />Yet, investors might reasonably be reassured by the resilience of the wider market. If that sounds odd, bear with me. Last week the broad selloff by hedge funds as they cut their leverage shook up stocks, with those heavily shorted rallying hard while the rest fell. Volatility jumped. The S&P 500 had its two worst days since October, as the effect of deleveraging was worsened by worries about the knock-on effects if a big hedge fund collapsed.<br />The market became highly sensitive to GameStop. Since the retailer was listed by then-owner Barnes & Noble in 2002, it has tended to move in the same direction as the S&P, with the 100-day correlation in their moves always being positive. Over the 10 days to Tuesday, the stock has moved in the same direction only twice, and the 100-day correlation is now negative. What was good for GameStop was bad for the market, and vice versa.<br />The reason for comfort is that stocks didn’t suffer more. It isn’t so much that we should be relieved that GameStop and the broader coordinated attacks by users of Reddit didn’t bring down a broker or start a chain reaction of hedge-fund failures, although of course that would have been very bad. The good news is that these worries didn’t trigger a significant correction."
