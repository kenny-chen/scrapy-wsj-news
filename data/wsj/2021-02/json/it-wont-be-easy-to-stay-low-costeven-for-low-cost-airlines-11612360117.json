    "body": "For vaccine optimists, there may be no clearer way to bet on the recovery than investing in budget airlines. But much depends on whether these low-cost carriers can remain, well, low cost.<br />This week, Dublin-based  Ryanair  reported fourth-quarter earnings well short of analyst expectations. Last week,  Southwest Airlines  managed to surpass forecasts but issued gloomy guidance for the current quarter. It is still up in the air whether leisure travel can reopen in time for the high-summer season.<br />But investors know that, sooner or later, the exit from the pandemic will play in favor of budget airlines and against their full-service competitors. Short-haul traffic will bounce back before international flights, and corporate travelers will be fewer and more price-conscious.<br />The rub is that the market has already priced a lot of this in: On average, the shares of low-cost carriers are back roughly to where they were a year ago, even though their revenues are only forecast to catch up with pre-pandemic trends around 2025. To meet expectations amid heavy discounting, they will need to come out of the Covid crisis making a lot more money with fewer sales.<br />Which is to say, with structurally lower costs. This is their challenge."
