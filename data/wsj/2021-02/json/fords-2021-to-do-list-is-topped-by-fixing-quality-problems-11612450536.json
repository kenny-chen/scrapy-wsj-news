    "body": "Ford  Motor Co. is curbing production of its F-150 pickup truck—the company’s biggest moneymaker—due to a shortage of semiconductors, as the global supply constraints for computer chips permeates deeper into the car business.<br />Ford  said Thursday it will cut F-150 production at a Detroit-area factory next week to just one eight-hour shift, from three shifts. Its other F-150 plant, in Kansas City, Mo., will run two of its three shifts next week, with both factories returning to their normal round-the-clock schedules on Feb. 15.<br />The cuts mark a significant escalation in the chip-shortage problem that has disrupted the auto industry globally in recent weeks.<br />The F-150 is the nation’s top-selling vehicle and  Ford ’s  profit engine, fueling most of its global income.<br />Ford is scheduled to report earnings Thursday after the closing bell."
