    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden announced three nominees to the U.S. Postal Service’s Board of Governors, saying they would make sure the agency “can effectively and efficiently serve all communities in our country.”<br />The president said Wednesday he was nominating Anton Hajjar, a former general counsel of the American Postal Workers Union; Amber McReynolds, chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for improved mail-in voting; and Ron Stroman, a former deputy postmaster general who led Mr. Biden’s transition team for postal-service issues.<br />If confirmed, they will fill three vacant seats on the nine-member board, which currently has six appointees of former President Donald Trump, two of whom are Democrats. The postmaster general serves at the pleasure of the board.<br />The announcement came as the House Oversight and Reform Committee heard testimony on Wednesday from Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a North Carolina businessman and Republican donor who was tapped by the board for the position last year.<br />Democrats have urged Mr. Biden to fill the vacant board seats in hopes that the new picks would help oust Mr. DeJoy amid criticism over mail-delivery delays."
