    "body": "BRUSSELS—Australia’s fight with  Facebook Inc.  over media content is focusing attention on European efforts to force tech giants to pay more for news, as European politicians urge national governments to quickly enact new legislation that would strengthen the hand of news organizations in their battle with internet behemoths.<br />European Union countries face a June deadline to adopt national versions of a bloc-wide law, dubbed the Copyright Directive, that aims to improve media producers’ bargaining position against tech powerhouses including Facebook and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google. Under the law, passed in 2019, news publishers can demand payment for reuse of their content.<br />Australia on Thursday passed a law that tackles many of the same issues, terms of which recently prompted Facebook to remove news from its platform in the country for five days before reversing course after winning some changes from the government.<br />Both laws stem from the same debate: what, if anything, should publishers be paid when their news is available via tech platforms.<br />Publishers argue that news is a significant attraction for services like Google, and that they should receive a share of the companies’ revenue. The tech companies, and tech advocates, respond that they already boost the media companies’ revenue by sending them tens of billions of website visits monthly, and that free linking is the internet’s lifeblood."
