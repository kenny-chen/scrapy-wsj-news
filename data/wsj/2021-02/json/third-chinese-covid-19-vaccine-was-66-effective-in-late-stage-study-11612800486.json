    "body": "TAIPEI, Taiwan—Early clinical trial results from several countries showed that a Covid-19 vaccine candidate jointly developed by the Chinese military and a private Chinese firm was 65.7% effective at preventing symptomatic cases of the coronavirus, potentially giving China a third effective vaccine candidate in fighting the pandemic.<br />The results from late-stage trials—which were first made public in a tweet by Faisal Sultan, special assistant on national health to Pakistan’s prime minister—come as global public-health experts have called for more transparency from Beijing and Chinese drugmakers on the efficacy and safety of their Covid-19 vaccines.<br />The candidate, developed by  CanSino Biologics Inc.  in conjunction with the Chinese military, is being tested in five countries: Pakistan, Russia, Argentina, Mexico and Chile.<br />Based on a multicountry analysis, Mr. Sultan tweeted, CanSino’s vaccine is 90.98% effective at preventing severe diseases. He wrote that the global analysis included 30,000 participants and 101 confirmed cases of Covid-19, though he didn’t disclose details of what was considered a symptomatic case, and which of those would then count as severe.<br />A person familiar with the matter confirmed the efficacy figures. The Chinese military couldn’t be reached to comment after working hours."
