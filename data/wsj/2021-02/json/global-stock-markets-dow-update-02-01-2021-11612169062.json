    "body": "U.S. stocks rebounded Monday, with major benchmarks recovering some ground following their worst week since October and the online day-trading crowd turning its sights to the silver market.<br />The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 229.29 points, or 0.8%, to 30211.91, the S&P 500 gained 59.62 points, or 1.6%, to 3773.86 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 332.70 points, or 2.5%, to 13403.39.<br />The day’s gains put the S&P 500 back into positive territory for the year.<br />Stocks had a rocky January, both setting records and getting roiled by day traders using Reddit and social media to coordinate and drive trading of heavily shorted stocks like  GameStop.  The latter sparked a volatile wave of trading that rocked a number of large hedge funds.<br />Beginning a new month gives the market a chance to reset, said Greg Harmon, founder and president of Dragonfly Capital."
