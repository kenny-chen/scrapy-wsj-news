    "body": "Three Turkish nationals were found guilty Wednesday of smuggling Carlos Ghosn into Turkey after he fled Japan inside a musical-equipment box, becoming the first people convicted in connection with the former auto chieftain’s escape from Japan in late 2019.<br />A judge in Istanbul handed down suspended prison sentences of four years and two months and fines of 31,240 Turkish lira, equivalent to $4,352, to three men—one airline manager and two pilots who flew Mr. Ghosn from Japan to Istanbul.<br />Lawyers for all three men said they maintained their innocence and planned to appeal the convictions.<br />Two other pilots who flew Mr. Ghosn from Istanbul to Beirut and were on trial for the same charges of migrant smuggling were acquitted. One flight attendant was also acquitted. The court dropped charges against a second flight attendant.<br />Mr. Ghosn, a former chairman and chief executive officer of  Nissan  Motor Co., had been living in a court-monitored house in Tokyo, awaiting trial on financial crimes charges, when he fled the country in December 2019. Hidden inside a box normally used to transport musical equipment, Mr. Ghosn was wheeled past security officers and passport control at an Osaka airport. He was then loaded onto a private jet and flown to Istanbul before boarding a second plane to Beirut."
