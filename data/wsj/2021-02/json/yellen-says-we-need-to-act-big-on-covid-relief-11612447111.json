    "body": "WASHINGTON—Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that President Biden wants to advance a new coronavirus relief package with bipartisan support but reiterated that the administration must act forcefully with a deal that supports families and businesses until the pandemic ends.<br />“We need to act big,” she said in an interview with ABC’s Good Morning America. “We need to make sure that we provide a bridge so that people aren’t scarred indefinitely by this crisis.”<br />Ms. Yellen also said she would discuss with a group of regulators on Thursday whether the recent market volatility related to  GameStop Corp.  and other stocks warrants some kind of further action from Washington.<br />“We really need to make sure that our financial markets are functioning properly, efficiently and that investors are protected,” she said, but added that regulators need to understand deeply what happened before making any decisions.<br />Ms. Yellen declined to say how soon the White House may move to advance Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief proposal without Republican support, if conversations over a bipartisan agreement drag on. House and Senate leaders took steps this week to begin a process, known as reconciliation, that would allow them to pass a measure with a simple majority vote in the Senate—rather than the 60 votes required for most Senate legislation."
