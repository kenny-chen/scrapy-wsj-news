    "body": "WASHINGTON—Neera Tanden, President Biden’s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, said she regretted past comments she made while running a center-left think tank and pledged to be nonpartisan if confirmed to the role by the Senate.<br />“I know there have been some concerns about some of my past language on social media, and I regret that language and take responsibility for it,” Ms. Tanden said in opening remarks at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. She didn’t specify which comments she was referring to.<br />She described herself as an “impassioned advocate” in her previous role as head of the Center for American Progress. But she added, “I understand that the role of OMB Director calls for bipartisan action, as well as a nonpartisan adherence to facts and evidence.”<br />Asked on Tuesday whether the White House asked Ms. Tanden to apologize for her tweets, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, “We certainly did not ask her to make any specific comments in her testimony today.” She said the president is confident Ms. Tanden will be confirmed.<br />Ms. Tanden has in recent years used  Twitter  to criticize then-President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers, while also tussling with the left wing of the Democratic Party."
