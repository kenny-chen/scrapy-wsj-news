    "body": "U.S. aviation regulators need to strengthen their oversight of aircraft safety even after reforms undertaken in the wake of the two  Boeing Co.  737 MAX crashes that claimed 346 lives, a government report has concluded.<br />An examination of the certification of the MAX also revealed that Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration still have a flawed relationship, which could hinder identifying future safety challenges, the Transportation Department’s inspector general said in a second report on the matter.<br />The FAA has agreed to implement 14 recommendations in the report, including how it addresses innovations introduced to existing aircraft designs and improved communication with Boeing. The agency received a draft version of the report in December.<br />The warning over ongoing issues comes during changes in global regulation of the aviation industry that include less reliance on approvals in an aircraft’s country of manufacture.<br />Boeing has had to push back the introduction of its newest jetliner, the 777X, partly because of extended certification issues related to the wide-body plane, the company said last month."
