    "body": "New federal charges were filed against two members of the far-right Proud Boys in connection to last month’s storming of the U.S. Capitol.<br />Ethan Nordean, also known as “Rufio Panman,” was arrested and charged Wednesday with obstructing an official proceeding, aiding and abetting, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, among other charges.<br />Nicholas Ochs, the leader of the Hawaii chapter of the Proud Boys, also faces new charges in a grand jury indictment obtained Wednesday, including conspiracy to obstruct Congress, and stealing and destroying government property. He was previously arrested on lesser charges connected to the riot.<br />Messrs. Nordean and Ochs couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Ochs hasn’t yet entered any plea to the charges.<br />Since the riot on Jan. 6, prosecutors have moved to arrest more than 150 participants of the pro-Trump mob on basic charges, including unlawfully entering a restricted building, and prosecutors said they planned to build more sophisticated cases through indictments in the ensuing weeks."
