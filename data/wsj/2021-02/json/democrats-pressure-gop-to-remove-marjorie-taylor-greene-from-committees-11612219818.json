    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Democrats will seek to remove contentious freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.)  from her committee assignments if Republicans don’t take action, according to people familiar with the plans.<br />The move increases pressure on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) at a time when he is caught in the party’s political cross-currents after former President Donald Trump’s loss. Stripping a lawmaker of committee assignments takes away an important venue to shape legislation and participate in panel debates, diminishing his or her influence.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said he has spoken to Mr. McCarthy, who has said he plans to meet with Mrs. Greene this week, likely on Tuesday. Mrs. Greene “must be held accountable for her reprehensible statements, and I am discussing with members the best course of action to do so,” Mr. Hoyer said Monday.<br />Mr. McCarthy didn’t respond to a request for comment on the Democrats’ push. If Mr. McCarthy doesn’t strip Mrs. Greene from her assignments on the budget and education committees, Democrats plan to bring up a measure to the Rules Committee on Wednesday afternoon, setting up a floor vote to remove her. The Rules Committee on Monday afternoon posted the resolution, scheduling it for a Wednesday meeting.<br />“It is my hope and expectation that Republicans will do the right thing and hold Rep. Greene accountable, and we will not need to consider this resolution. But we are prepared to do so if necessary,” Mr. Hoyer said."
