    "body": "The private-equity arm of Stockholm-based  EQT  AB has agreed to sell U.S. water infrastructure company Innovyze to publicly traded  Autodesk Inc.  in a $1 billion deal that people familiar with the matter say stands to return more than four times EQT’s initial investment.<br />Innovyze offers software and technology that governments, utilities, engineering firms and corporations use to manage water and wastewater systems, drainage, distribution, flood modeling and other services. The Portland, Ore.-based company serves some 6,500 clients across 60 countries, including the Los Angeles County Public Works Department, New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection and  Balfour Beatty  PLC.<br />One of the people familiar with the deal said that Innovyze has roughly tripled its annual revenue under EQT’s ownership.<br />EQT created the water infrastructure business in 2017 through the combination of two technology units it had acquired out of larger corporations: XP Solutions and Innovyze. At the time, the firm was attracted to what it saw as a relatively low level of technology adoption among water utilities compared with other industries such as healthcare or finance, according to partner Arvindh Kumar, who joined EQT in early 2020 to lead the firm’s U.S. investments in technology, media and telecommunications.<br />“We thought that over a longer period of time it [would be] a very attractive market where there would be growth and adoption of technology solutions to help utilities,” Mr. Kumar said."
