    "body": "LONDON—Global wind- and solar-power capacity grew at a record pace last year even as the pandemic sent overall energy demand sharply lower, oil giant  BP  PLC said in its annual review of global energy markets.<br />Growth in renewables—led by China—saw global solar-power capacity rise around 22%, while wind-power capacity climbed around 18% compared with the previous year, BP said Thursday. The combined rate of additions was the highest since BP started publishing the Statistical Review of  World Energy ,  a closely watched report card on energy use, 70 years ago.<br />The gains for lower-carbon power come as companies and governments around the world seek to embrace renewable power as part of efforts to reduce emissions and address climate change.<br />Still, renewable energy as a whole, which includes solar and wind but also geothermal and biomass, represented just 6% of the world’s energy consumption last year, the review found.<br />Oil made up 31% of consumption, coal 27%, and natural gas 25%. The remainder was made up of hydroelectricity and nuclear power."
