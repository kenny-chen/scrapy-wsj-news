    "body": "SoftBank Group Corp.  is leading an investment in AnyVision Interactive Technologies Ltd. that values the facial-recognition company at over $1 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter, underscoring its commitment to the technology despite pushback over privacy concerns.<br />The Tel Aviv-based company, which uses artificial intelligence to recognize faces and objects, said Wednesday that it had raised $235 million from SoftBank’s Vision Fund and other investors that it planned to use to expand in the U.S.<br />The fundraising comes as facial-recognition technology faces growing scrutiny from regulators and activists who say it infringes on privacy. Last month the European Union proposed a new law that sought to limit police use of the technology, while several U.S. cities including San Francisco and Portland, Ore., have banned it.<br />Large technology companies including Google’s  Alphabet Inc.,   Microsoft Corp.  and  Amazon Inc.  have also stopped or dialed down their sales of facial-recognition technology in the past few years, citing privacy concerns.<br />That pullback impacted AnyVision last year when Microsoft sold its stake in the startup citing “the challenges of being a minority investor in a company that sells sensitive technology.”"
