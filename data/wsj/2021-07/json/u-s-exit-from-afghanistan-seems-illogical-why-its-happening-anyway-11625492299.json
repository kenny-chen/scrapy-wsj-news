    "body": "The U.S. military hasn’t suffered a fatality in Afghanistan since February 2020—that is, for 16 months. So the tangible costs of staying in the country, at the reduced troop levels that had become the new normal, would have been relatively low.<br />Meantime, the intangible risks of leaving, on humanitarian as well as strategic grounds, are relatively high.<br />So what is it about the mood of America today that is compelling a departure?<br />The question is largely rhetorical at this point, because the departure is happening. The Pentagon said last week that the withdrawal will be completed by the end of August, a few weeks earlier than expected when President Biden said forces would be out by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that prompted the move into Afghanistan in the first place.<br />The departure impulse is bipartisan. Former President Donald Trump announced while he was still in office that all forces would be gone this year; Mr. Biden is following through."
