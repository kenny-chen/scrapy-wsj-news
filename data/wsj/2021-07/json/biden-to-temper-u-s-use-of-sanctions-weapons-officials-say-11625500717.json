    "body": "The Biden administration is revamping the way the U.S. uses punitive sanctions, aiming to stem sweeping pressure campaigns, avoid collateral economic damage and act jointly with allies rather than unilaterally, according to people involved in the planning process.<br />The administration has nearly completed an extensive review of U.S. sanctions policy, which is expected out near the end of summer, according to one official. While details are still being ironed out, Biden administration officials have foreshadowed elements of the new strategy in a series of actions, including the planned easing of economywide sanctions against Iran.<br />Details of President Biden’s approach also were described by current and former administration officials as well as by incoming officials during congressional meetings.<br />The policy overhaul sets up a sharp departure from the Trump administration, which imposed sanctions as a foreign policy tool more frequently than previous U.S. administrations to target broad sectors of the economy in Iran, North Korea, Venezuela and elsewhere in an effort to exert economic pressure against adversaries.<br />The sanctions efforts succeeded in helping push Iran and Venezuela into economic contractions and severing North Korea’s ties to global financial and trade networks, achieving short-term goals."
