    "body": "Senate Democrats have unveiled a $3.5 trillion price tag for their antipoverty, education and climate plan. Here are details on the proposal and the steps needed to turn their broad budget framework into actual legislation and law, according to lawmakers and aides.<br /><br />The $3.5 trillion in spending and tax credits—which the lawmakers hope to offset with tax increases and savings elsewhere—will determine the specific policy priorities that Democrats can fit into their antipoverty, education and climate legislation. They will seek to codify the agreement on the top-line spending figure into a budget resolution in the coming weeks and get it approved by Congress.  The number marks a middle ground between the $6 trillion package some progressives were seeking and the roughly $2 trillion figure backed by some centrists.<br /><br />The legislation Democrats are preparing is expected to include paid family and medical leave, subsidized child care, an extension of an expanded child tax credit, universal prekindergarten for three and four-year-olds and affordable housing, among other issues. It would also extend expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies  approved earlier this year in the Covid-19 aid package."
