    "body": "AMMAN, Jordan—A Jordanian court convicted Monday two men for sedition over an alleged plot to replace King Abdullah II with former Crown Prince Hamzah bin Hussein, following a public rift between the two royals that shook the image of the critical U.S. ally as an island of stability in the Middle East.<br />Former royal court chief Bassem Awadallah, who holds Jordanian and American citizenships, and royal Sharif Hassan bin Zaid, a distant cousin of the king, were sentenced to 15 years in prison for undermining the country’s security and stability, state media said.<br />Both men had pleaded not guilty, and an appeal is expected.<br />The rift between King Abdullah and his half-brother Prince Hamzah burst into the open in April and upended politics in the kingdom. The government has said the king’s half-brother had plotted with others to undermine stability by fanning discontent in an effort to rise to power.<br />Prince Hamzah has denied wrongdoing. He wasn’t on trial, following family mediation in which he expressed support for the king. The court refused a request by the defense for him to testify."
