    "body": "After the FDA approved a controversial new Alzheimer’s drug, doctors have been fielding lots of questions about it from patients and their caregivers.<br />The drug, called Aduhelm and made by  Biogen ,  removes amyloid, a sticky substance in the brain that is a defining feature of Alzheimer’s disease. But some doctors say it’s unclear whether removing amyloid will actually slow the progression of the disease. Clinical trials yielded mixed results.<br />On Thursday, Biogen said the FDA had narrowed the prescribing instructions for the drug, recommending the therapy be given to people with early-stage symptoms of the disease. Initially, the FDA approved Aduhelm in June for all Alzheimer’s patients.<br />Alzheimer’s, a progressive brain disorder that affects memory and cognitive skills, is the most common cause of dementia. Its biological hallmark is sticky protein clusters—called amyloid plaques—in the brain, as well as tangles of fibers, composed of tau protein.<br />We asked doctors what patients need to know about the new drug—and what questions they should be asking their doctors."
