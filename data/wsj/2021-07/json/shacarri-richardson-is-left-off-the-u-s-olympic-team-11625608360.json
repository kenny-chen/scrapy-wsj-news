    "body": "Team USA’s roster of track and field athletes at the Tokyo Olympics will be missing its  biggest newsmaker ahead of the Games: sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson.<br />The 21-year-old winner of the U.S. Olympic track and field trials’ women’s 100 meters last month was left off the team named Tuesday by USA Track & Field, after an anti-doping test detected a chemical found in marijuana. Richardson was disqualified from the 100 meters, but USATF, the sport’s national governing body, had the option to select her to run in a relay in Tokyo. It declined.<br />“While USATF fully agrees that the merit of the World Anti-Doping Agency rules related to THC should be reevaluated, it would be detrimental to the integrity of the U.S. Olympic Team Trials for Track & Field if USATF amended its policies following competition, only weeks before the Olympic Games,” USATF  said in a statement Tuesday.<br />“All USATF athletes are equally aware of and must adhere to the current anti-doping code, and our credibility as the National Governing Body would be lost if rules were only enforced under certain circumstances.”<br />The statement praised Richardson’s accountability and said that USATF will offer her “our continued support both on and off the track.”"
