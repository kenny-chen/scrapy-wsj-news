    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration expects to name Alan Estevez, a former Pentagon official in the Obama administration, as the Commerce Department undersecretary in charge of export control, according to people with knowledge of the selection.<br />Mr. Estevez would oversee the 450-person Bureau of Industry and Security, a position that has taken on heightened importance as the U.S. looks to stop China from obtaining advanced U.S. technology.<br />The bureau has a major say in deciding which technologies are exported to China, which are blocked, and which Chinese companies wind up on a Commerce Department blacklist. The position requires Senate confirmation.<br />Commerce declined to comment. Mr. Estevez, currently a consultant with Deloitte Consulting LLP, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />During the Obama administration, Mr. Estevez was principal deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. Before that, he had other Pentagon positions overseeing logistics and managing the Defense Department’s vast supply chain."
