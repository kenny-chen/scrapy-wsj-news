    "body": "As Americans look to resume international travel, the State Department is struggling to clear a backlog of passport applications that is frustrating some travelers, and an official said an increase in staffing won’t immediately resolve the delays.<br />Rachel Arndt, the department‘s assistant secretary for passport services, said there is currently a backlog of between 1.5 million and 2 million passport applications. “That is somewhat higher than what we would normally expect to see,” she said.<br />Ms. Arndt attributed the large backlog to the sudden swell in travel that has coincided with increased Covid-19 vaccination rates among Americans, and said staffing was rising to handle the applications.<br />“We are surging staff, both adjudicators and contractors, back into the office at agencies across the country as Covid restrictions ease,” Ms. Arndt said.<br />She said applicants wouldn’t see immediate decreases in processing times. Currently, the department’s estimated turnaround times are 18 weeks for a standard passport application and 12 weeks for an expedited application. Pre-pandemic, it took six to eight weeks for regular applications and two to three weeks for expedited ones."
