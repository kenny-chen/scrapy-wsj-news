    "body": "WASHINGTON—Six months after a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, senators are locked in a partisan standoff over how much money to spend to shore up security and whether emergency funding is needed to help Afghan refugees and cover Covid-19 expenses incurred by Congress and the Defense Department.<br />Unless lawmakers act soon to pay unexpected costs stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, the National Guard could be forced to cut training and the Capitol Police could face furloughs as early as next month, members of both parties warn.<br />But Democrats’ and Republicans’ proposals are billions of dollars apart. Any legislation would need to get at least 60 votes in the evenly divided Senate to advance, meaning that at least 10 Republicans would have to vote for it.<br />Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, introduced a $3.7 billion supplemental spending bill on Monday. That is significantly larger than the $1.9 billion supplemental spending bill the House passed in May by a single vote, with no Republican support.<br />“A violent insurrection happened,” Mr. Leahy said. “A pandemic happened. And the president announced the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. These events created urgent needs that must be met.”"
