    "body": "President Biden intends to nominate former Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake to serve as ambassador to Turkey, the White House said.<br />Mr. Flake is a critic of former President Donald Trump and didn’t seek re-election in 2018. The ambassadorship, which requires Senate confirmation, would place him in a key position for the Democratic administration at a time of ongoing tension with Ankara.<br />“Given the strategic importance of the United States’ relationship with our long-time NATO Ally, the Republic of Turkey, I am honored and humbled by the trust President Biden has placed in me with this ambassadorial nomination,” Mr. Flake said in a statement.<br />The U.S. and Turkish relationship has deteriorated in recent years, with Washington criticizing Ankara’s human-rights record and its increasingly assertive role in the Middle East. Turkey is opposed to U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria.<br />The U.S. penalized Turkey over its purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile-defense system. In April, the Biden administration also recognized the early 20th century Armenian genocide under the Ottoman Empire for the first time, despite Ankara’s vehement opposition."
