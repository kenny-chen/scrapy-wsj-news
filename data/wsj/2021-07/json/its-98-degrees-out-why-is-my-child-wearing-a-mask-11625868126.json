    "body": "Washington<br />My 9-year-old daughter came home from camp two weeks ago after playing three hours of outdoor tennis in a mask. “I thought I was going to faint,” she told me, looking ill after playing in 98-degree weather. Later that afternoon the camp, run by the Sidwell Friends School, called to complain about her mask compliance.<br />We’re now 16 months into the pandemic and children remain victims of the Covid political theater that has characterized the national debate about masks ever since.<br />We’ve had an entire school year to prove what scientists have said all along: Children aren’t major vectors of the virus, and schools and child-care centers aren’t drivers of community spread. Consider three of my children and their two schools. One went to class in person all year unmasked; the other two were required to wear masks, even at recess. Both schools had the same number of Covid cases: zero.<br />Multiple peer-reviewed studies have found that children transmit the virus at a much lower rate than adults do. The latest comprehensive data show that children have an extremely low chance of dying or becoming seriously ill from Covid-19, and that the child mortality rate is much lower than what public-health officials had initially suspected."
