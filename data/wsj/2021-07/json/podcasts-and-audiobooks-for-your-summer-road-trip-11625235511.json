    "body": "Comedian Judy Gold likes listening to podcasts and audiobooks on road trips, while her kids prefer rap music. Now that the whole family can drive, she realizes she made a strategic mistake during their adolescence.<br />“Like an idiot, when they were kids, I’d be like: well, the driver gets to pick the music,” she says. “So, you know, that wasn’t a good rule.”<br />With Americans hitting the road this Fourth of July, the debate over what to listen to is once again front and center. Here are a few new podcasts (and audiobooks), as well as recommendations from experts, for whoever is behind the wheel.<br />(Audible)<br />Jamie Lee Curtis’s narrative fiction podcast, “Letters From Camp,” stars Sunny Sandler as Mookie Hooper, a mystery-solving camper at Camp Cartwright. Ms. Curtis—who co-created the show and plays the camp’s director—says the series was inspired by her own experiences at summer camp growing up, as well as a letter that her god daughter, Boco Haft, wrote her from camp a dozen years ago, but that wasn’t put in the mail until two years ago. Ms. Haft is the show’s writer and co-creator."
