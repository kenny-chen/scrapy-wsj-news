    "body": "If you’re a federal prosecutor, you might look at the sentences ProPublica published to justify its role in trafficking a decade’s worth of stolen tax documents from thousands of U.S. taxpayers.<br />“The confidential tax records obtained by ProPublica,” claims the nonprofit investigative reporting outfit, “show that the ultrarich effectively sidestep this system” (emphasis added).<br />Understand: “This system,” in ProPublica’s usage, means our income tax system; by “sidestepping,” it means legally complying with the code.<br />Again: “The IRS records show that the wealthiest can—perfectly legally—pay income taxes that are only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions, if not billions, their fortunes grow each year” (emphasis added).<br />The records “show” they paid their legal taxes; only in the most obtuse sense do tax records “show” that taxpayers didn’t pay a tax on unrealized gains that doesn’t exist as part of the tax system."
