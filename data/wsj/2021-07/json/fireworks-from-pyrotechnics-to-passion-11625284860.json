    "body": "Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />If there’s one word that Americans associate with Fourth of July festivities, it’s “fireworks”—a term that has been used continually since the country’s earliest Independence Day celebrations.<br />In 1777, the year after the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia marked the anniversary with “a grand exhibition of fireworks, which began and concluded with thirteen rockets on the commons, and the city was beautifully illuminated,” according to one dispatch.<br />The fireworks celebrated independence from Great Britain, but both the colorful combustibles and the common name for them were direct imports from the new nation’s erstwhile colonizers. Fireworks themselves were first developed in China, the home of gunpowder. But the word for them entered English in the early 16th century, likely influenced by comparable words in Dutch (“vuurwerk”) and German (“Feuerwerk”).<br />Originally, all of these terms referred to the military use of explosive devices, particularly gunpowder charges. During the reign of Henry VIII, English forces held control over Calais in northern France, and a document dated to 1528 specified the components of “fyre worke” that would be needed to defend the city from assault by French troops."
