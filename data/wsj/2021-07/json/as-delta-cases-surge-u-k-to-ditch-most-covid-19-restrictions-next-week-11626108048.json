    "body": "<br />LONDON—The U.K. government confirmed plans to drop almost all coronavirus restrictions in England next week, while urging citizens to keep wearing face masks indoors and to continue working from home if they can.<br />Prime Minister Boris Johnson is gambling that vaccines will prevent another large wave of deaths even as cases linked to the Delta variant of coronavirus surge, allowing a shift toward protecting public health with greater personal responsibility and away from legally enforceable containment measures.<br />Even so, the rapid proliferation of Delta cases has repeatedly damped ambitions for a grand summer reopening. The plan had initially been to ditch almost all restrictions in June—but Delta meant a four-week delay. Mr. Johnson, who previously talked up the government’s steady easing strategy as “a one-way road to freedom,” warned Britons on Monday that he couldn’t rule out reimposing restrictions in the future.<br />“We want people to remember that this thing, this pandemic, is not over. We must proceed in a cautious way,” Mr. Johnson said at a news conference."
