    "body": "<br />Los Angeles<br />About 4,500 years ago, an image of the Sumerian storm god Ningirsu was engraved on a silver vessel now on view in the Getty Villa Museum exhibition “Mesopotamia: Civilization Begins.”<br />He is, we see, a lion-headed eagle, a master of the wild, grasping lions and ibexes in his curled claws. The vessel—known as the “Vase of Enmetena,” after a king of that period—was apparently filled with an offering meant to pacify Ningirsu. I would have provided a second helping.<br />Greek gods could be petty and jealous. But this region’s gods, who came into being much earlier, and reigned in various incarnations over the lands between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, are more like brute animals than flawed humans. The demon Pazuzu, associated, the exhibition tells us, with “the ill winds that brought plague and other maladies,” appears here as a horrifying bronze statuette (934-610 B.C.); he possesses raptor talons, a scorpion’s tail and a head combining a dog and lion. “I have scaled the powerful mountains,” reads his cuneiform inscription. “They trembled.”"
