    "body": "Kathryn Gamble, a Chicago veterinarian, and her husband, Texas orchestra conductor Robert Carter Austin, have been frequent visitors to Venice for more than two decades, staying in hotels or short-term rentals. They were ready to buy a home there in 2020, but Covid-19 intervened.<br />Now, as trans-Atlantic travel for Americans tentatively resumes, they are restarting their search.<br />During the couple’s most recent Venetian sojourn in 2018, they rented a palazzo on the Grand Canal, recalls Dr. Gamble. They hosted friends and family, and flew a Texas flag from the balcony. Looking ahead to ownership, they hope to recapture some of that atmosphere.<br />“We need to be on the water,” says the 54-year-old. “And we need to have three or four bedrooms. It’s Venice, and people will come to visit.”<br />Dr. Gamble and her husband, 75, recently made inquiries about a nine-bedroom, 17th-century Grand Canal palazzo listed for $11.2 million, according to Knight Frank, which is handling the sale. On the other side of the canal, a six-bedroom, 3,800-square-foot apartment in an early-20th-century building is listed for $2.7 million."
