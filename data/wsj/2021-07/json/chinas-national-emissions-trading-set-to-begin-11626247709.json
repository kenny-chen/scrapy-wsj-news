    "body": "HONG KONG—China will launch a national emissions-trading program on Friday, according to people familiar with the matter, creating the world’s largest carbon market and doubling the share of global emissions covered under such programs.<br />The carbon market will help the country lower greenhouse-gas emissions and achieve its goal of reaching peak emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality, or net zero emissions, by 2060, officials said at a news conference Wednesday. China is the world’s largest carbon emitter.<br />The program will initially involve 2,225 companies in the power sector. Those companies are responsible for a seventh of global carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, according to calculations by the International Energy Agency.<br />Under the trading program, emitters such as power plants and factories are given a fixed amount of carbon they are allowed to release a year. They can in turn buy or sell those allowances. That pushes emitters to think of controlling and reducing emissions in terms of a market.<br />Bloomberg earlier reported that the carbon market would start trading on Friday."
