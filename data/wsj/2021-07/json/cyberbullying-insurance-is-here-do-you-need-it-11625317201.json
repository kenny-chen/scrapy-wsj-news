    "body": "If you’re a victim of cyberbullying, you might be entitled to compensation.<br />That’s the pitch insurance companies are selling to families and individuals, as cyberbullying among adults, tweens and teens  becomes more common.<br />Insurance tech startup Waffle in May began offering stand-alone cyberprotection policies underwritten by Chubb that include cyberbullying and other cyber risks such as identity theft or extortion. The policies are intended to help victims recover costs associated with cyberbullying, such as legal fees, mental health services, tutoring to cover missed school or relocation costs if bullying was so bad that a student had to move to a new school.<br />“Mark my words, in five years every major insurance company will offer this,” Waffle Chief Executive Officer Quentin Coolen said.<br />Personal cyber insurance is still a nascent category. Only about 10% of U.S. consumers who own Internet-connected devices said they have insurance to help them recover from a cyberattack, and 74% said they’re unwilling, or don’t know whether they’re willing, to pay more for cyber-risk coverage, according to a 2019 survey commissioned by the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group."
