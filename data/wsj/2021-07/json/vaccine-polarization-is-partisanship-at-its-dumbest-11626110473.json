    "body": "Indulge yourself in a little alternative history.<br />Imagine that Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration-led effort to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, had been a bit speedier in its execution, so that instead of the final  Pfizer  trial results becoming known a week after the election, they had come a week before it.<br />Imagine that President Trump, hailing the most extraordinary scientific success by a government-led effort since the Manhattan Project, had won rather than lost a close election.<br />Neither idea is fanciful. So ask yourself: How would the media have covered the vaccination rollout over the ensuing months?<br />Given that a vaccine had been rushed out in record time, beating all previous vaccine developments by years, and by a Trump administration that was routinely accused by the media of political malpractice, my guess is that vaccine skepticism would have been commonplace among those editors and commentators who solemnly insist today they are guided entirely by the science."
