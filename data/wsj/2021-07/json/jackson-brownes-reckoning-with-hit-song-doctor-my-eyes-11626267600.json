    "body": "In 1971, singer-songwriter Jackson Browne was 22 and about to play a significant role in shaping the direction of Southern California’s country-rock movement.<br />His first solo album, “Jackson Browne,” was recorded that summer and released in early 1972. The single, “Doctor My Eyes,” peaked at No. 8 on Billboard’s pop chart. In 2019, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.<br />Fifty years later, Mr. Browne reflected on the writing, recording and producing of “Doctor My Eyes.” Mr. Browne will tour this fall, and his new album, “Downhill From Everywhere” (Inside Recordings), is out July 23. Edited from an interview.<br />Jackson Browne:In mid-1969, I was living in Los Angeles, in a basement apartment in Echo Park.<br />I had my grandfather’s upright Fischer piano from the early 1900s. He was a printer and craftsman and had painted wildflowers on the front and the sides."
