    "body": "LOS ANGELES—Britney Spears retained a new lawyer, Greenberg Traurig LLP’s Mathew Rosengart, Wednesday who promised to petition the court to remove Ms. Spears’s father, James Spears, from his role as her conservator.<br />At the hearing, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Judge Brenda Penny accepted the resignation of Ms. Spears’s prior court-appointed attorney, Samuel Ingham III, and she acknowledged Mr. Rosengart as her new lawyer.<br />The hearing marked the next steps in the 39-year-old pop star’s effort to reclaim more control over her life and $60 million estate 13 years into a conservatorship that put Mr. Spears at the helm.<br />Ms. Spears addressed the court via phone and fell into tears at the end of another emotional testimony two weeks after an earlier hearing in which she railed against her father and her legal predicament. In this hearing, she repeatedly asked Judge Penny to remove her father from the conservatorship immediately and to investigate him for “abuse.” Ms. Spears described years of being overworked and restricted in her freedom to do anything from take hair vitamins, to drink coffee, to eat a hamburger and french fries.<br />She described her circumstances as “f---ing cruelty.” “If this is not abuse I don’t know what is.”"
