    "body": "ViacomCBS Inc.  said it is naming chief executives of Nickelodeon and MTV Entertainment Group as it readies a major international push for its flagship video-streaming service.<br />Brian Robbins, who runs the Nickelodeon cable channel and has oversight of the company’s entertainment group for children and families, was promoted to president and CEO of that unit. Chris McCarthy, president of MTV Entertainment Group, which includes MTV, Comedy Central and the Paramount Network, similarly gained an expanded title as president and CEO of that division.<br />The moves give Messrs. Robbins and McCarthy additional oversight of their groups’ global content strategies for international markets as ViacomCBS prepares to expand its flagship streaming service, Paramount+, around the world. The company said on an earnings call in May that Paramount+ would be available in 45 markets by 2022.<br />“These changes enable a truly global approach to brand management, content acquisitions and licensing across ViacomCBS’ networks around the world,” ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish said in a statement Thursday.<br />ViacomCBS launched the Paramount+ streaming platform in March in the U.S., where it competes in a crowded domestic market with incumbents including Netflix Inc. and  Amazon.com Inc. ’s  Prime video platform along with newer entrants such as  Walt Disney Co. ’s Disney+ service."
