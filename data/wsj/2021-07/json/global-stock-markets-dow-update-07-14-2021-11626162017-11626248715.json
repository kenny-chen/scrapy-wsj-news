    "body": "U.S. stock futures wavered Wednesday ahead of earnings from some of the biggest financial institutions and testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1% and contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by the same amount, suggesting that both major indexes may tread water at the opening bell. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% on Tuesday. Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.3% Wednesday, signaling that technology stocks will outperform for a second day.<br />Stocks have powered to record highs on expectations of a strong economic rebound and a bumper set of corporate results in the earnings season just getting under way. However, some investors are wary of potential hurdles for the broad market rally up ahead.<br />One factor making money managers cautious is uncertainty about how long the bout of higher inflation—running at its quickest pace in 13 years—will last and how the Fed will respond. Another is the spread of the delta variant of coronavirus, which on Wednesday prompted Australian officials to extend a lockdown of Sydney, while South Korea tightened curbs.<br />“We would not be surprised if you had a bit of a pullback,” said Daniel Morris, chief market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management."
