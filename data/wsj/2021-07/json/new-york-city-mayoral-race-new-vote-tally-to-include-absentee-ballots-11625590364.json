    "body": "Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a former police officer who made public safety the centerpiece of his campaign, won New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary, according to election results released Tuesday.<br />The city’s Board of Election released the results after a ranked-choice tabulation of in-person votes and more than 125,000 absentee ballots. The process involved the elimination of candidates and redistribution of votes over a series of rounds until only two contestants remained.<br />The results showed that Mr. Adams received 50.5% of the nearly 938,000 votes. Former sanitation commissioner Kathryn Garcia received 49.5% of votes and trailed Mr. Adams by 8,426 votes—an insurmountable gap as fewer than 1,000 votes remain to be counted.<br />The Associated Press called the race for Mr. Adams after the results were released Tuesday.<br />Maya Wiley, a former counsel to outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio, placed third."
