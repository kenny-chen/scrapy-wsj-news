    "body": "LONDON—England woke from its European Championship hangover on Monday to confront a barrage of racist abuse that had been directed at the three national team players who missed penalty kicks in Sunday night’s defeat against Italy.<br />What started as an opportunity for a moment of national unity here turned ugly as the trio of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Bukayo Saka, who are Black, were immediately targeted after England’s loss to Italy by thousands of racist social media posts. A mural of Rashford in his native Manchester was also defaced.<br />Prince William and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson both condemned the attacks.  Twitter  said on Monday morning that it had removed 1,000 posts directed at the players and “permanently suspended a number of accounts,” while  Facebook  said it had deleted “vile comments” from Instagram without specifying how many.<br />“This England team deserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media,” Johnson tweeted. “Those responsible for this appalling abuse should be ashamed of themselves.”<br />Prince William added: “I am sickened by the racist abuse aimed at England players after last night’s match. It is totally unacceptable that players have to endure this abhorrent behaviour.”"
