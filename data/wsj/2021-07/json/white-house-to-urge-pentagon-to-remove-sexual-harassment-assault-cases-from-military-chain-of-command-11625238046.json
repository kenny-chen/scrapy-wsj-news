    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. military must remove sexual harassment and assault cases from the chain of command and hand them off to independent military lawyers, President Biden said Friday, marking one of the biggest expected changes in the history of the military justice system.<br />“We need concrete actions that fundamentally change the way we handle military sexual assault and that make it clear that these crimes will not be minimized or dismissed,” Mr. Biden said.<br />The changes were spurred by growing frustration on Capitol Hill about the military’s inability to tackle the problem. The military’s statistics show that even though the Pentagon has said it has made a priority of preventing sexual assault and harassment in the ranks, reported incidents have doubled in the past decade.<br />The White House will push Congress to enact legislation making the necessary legal changes, and then give the military until 2023 to implement them, senior administration officials told reporters during a telephone briefing.<br />The changes are aimed at “professionalizing the sexual-assault response” within the military, one of the administration officials said."
