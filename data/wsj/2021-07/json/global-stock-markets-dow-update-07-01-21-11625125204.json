    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged up, signaling muted gains for major indexes at the start of the second half of the year, ahead of data on jobless claims and manufacturing activity.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.1%, a day after the broad stocks gauge closed at its 34th all-time high of the year and advanced for a fifth consecutive quarter. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average also ticked up 0.1%. Futures for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 wavered between small gains and losses.<br />Stocks have been lifted to record highs by data showing the U.S. economy is growing at a rapid clip, and the prospect of a bumper set of second-quarter earnings at the largest companies. Meantime, investors have grown less concerned that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to ward off higher inflation.<br />“The growth backdrop is there, stimulus is still there, earnings are phenomenal,” said Caroline Simmons, U.K. chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. She added, though, that economic growth in the U.S. might be past its peak, which could lead defensive corners of the market to perform well in coming months.<br />Ahead of the bell in New York, shares of  CureVac  slumped 13%. The German company released the final results for its once-promising Covid-19 vaccine, indicating it provided less protection than the shots already authorized for use in the U.S."
