    "body": "THINK OF THIS DISH as a souvenir of a sunny holiday. “I invented it after I came back from Greece,” said chef Meherwan Irani. His final Slow Food Fast recipe features grilled cherry tomatoes, halloumi cheese and bread spiced with chaat masala. “People were over and I needed something quick,” Mr. Irani recalled. “I was trying to get rid of extra tomatoes. And I’m scrappy.”<br />The sliced cheese grills until it’s caramelized on the outside and softened within. It provides a salty counterpoint to the tomatoes, dressed with tart pomegranate molasses, olive oil and fresh cilantro and parsley. “It just works,” said the chef. “I like the flavor of charred tomatoes and how juicy they get.”<br />The grilled bread comes in handy for mopping up all those juices, and its dusting of spice adds yet more layers of flavor. “Chaat masala is a seasoning with a little green mango for tartness, a little black salt for funkiness and three or four other spices,” Mr. Irani said. For a simple recipe that’s super fast to pull together, there’s a lot going on.<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.<br />—Kitty Greenwald is a chef, food writer and the co-author of ‘Slow Fires’ (Clarkson Potter)"
