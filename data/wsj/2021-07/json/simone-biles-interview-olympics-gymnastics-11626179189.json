    "body": "<br />The world wants everything from Simone Biles, and she keeps on giving it. She pulls off some of the most difficult skills in gymnastics better than any of her competitors, then adds unimaginable ones. She takes an improbable winning streak and extends it again. Competing at 24 years old and showing everyone that she’s stronger than she was at 19—her age when she near-swept the 2016 Olympics in Rio—she is a real-time refutation of the assumption that late adolescence spells the end of a top gymnast’s career.<br />It’s all the more remarkable because of everything she’s had to get through to be here.<br />When I spoke to Biles via Zoom in late May, she was at her home in Spring, Texas—briefly—in between competitions. At the U.S. Classic held in Indianapolis a few days earlier, her first time under the bright lights after a 19-month pandemic layoff, she debuted the hardest vault in the history of women’s gymnastics, a Yurchenko double pike that lit up social media. She had a day off as she traveled back to Texas and was in the gym again the next day to prepare for national championships a week later.<br />Biles says that gymnastics, and the laser focus that training and competition demand, gives her a chance to ignore everything else. “It gives me a break; it’s kind of my safe zone,” she says."
