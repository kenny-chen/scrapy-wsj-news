    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court upheld a pair of Arizona voting rules against Democratic claims that the state discriminated against minority voters, a decision that could make it more difficult to challenge new state efforts to tighten election regulations.<br />The court, in a 6-3 opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, ruled Arizona was on solid legal ground in enforcing rules that prohibit third parties from collecting mail-in ballots and disallow votes cast in the wrong precinct.<br />The decision, issued on the final day before the court’s summer recess, was one of two major rulings that divided the court along ideological lines, with conservatives in the majority. The court also struck down a California requirement that tax-exempt charities disclose their major donors to state regulators.<br />Justice Alito said that while Arizona “generally makes it very easy to vote,” the process of voting entails some level of burden for everyone. “Mere inconvenience” for voters isn’t enough to establish that election regulations violate the law, Justice Alito wrote.<br />He said the existence of some disparity in how an election regulation affects different racial and ethnic groups “does not necessarily mean that a system is not equally open or that it does not give everyone an equal opportunity to vote.”"
