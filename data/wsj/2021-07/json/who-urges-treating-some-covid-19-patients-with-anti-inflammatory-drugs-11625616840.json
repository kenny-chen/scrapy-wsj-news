    "body": "The World Health Organization recommended that certain hospitalized Covid-19 patients be given a type of anti-inflammatory drug found to reduce the risk of death by 13% in the sickest patients when taken in combination with steroids.<br />The global public-health agency updated its Covid-19 treatment guidelines on Tuesday to strongly recommend that people with severe or critical disease be given drugs tocilizumab and sarilumab to combat the haywire inflammatory immune reaction of some patients.<br />The drugs are designed to block a protein called interleukin-6, or IL-6, that is thought to play a role in the hyper-inflammation experienced by some Covid-19 patients.<br />The WHO said the drugs are the first found to be effective against Covid-19 since the agency recommended the use of steroids in September.<br />“Patients severely or critically ill with Covid-19 often suffer from an overreaction of the immune system, which can be very harmful to the patient’s health,” the WHO said in a statement. “Interleukin-6 blocking drugs—tocilizumab and sarilumab—act to suppress this overreaction.”"
