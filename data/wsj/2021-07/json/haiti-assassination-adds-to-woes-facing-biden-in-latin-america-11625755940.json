    "body": "WASHINGTON—The crisis in Haiti is adding to the Biden administration’s slate of challenges in the Western Hemisphere, where officials had sought to focus on the flow of unauthorized migrants across the U.S.’s southern border.<br />Rising economic hardship from the Covid-19 pandemic has added to the longstanding drivers of migration, including Central America’s endemic criminal violence, two devastating hurricanes last year and repeated droughts.<br />Haitian President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination injects further instability in the region, where political and economic crises are expanding the ranks of asylum seekers and compounding difficulties facing the Biden administration at the border, officials and experts said.<br />“We’ve seen a real lack of confidence in governments, which was something we saw pre-Covid, but it has become increasingly apparent,” said Margaret Myers, a director at the Inter-American Dialogue, a U.S.-based think tank.<br />Republicans and some Democrats have criticized the U.S. administration’s handling of the border for months, including for sending mixed messages to those considering whether to migrate. Children and families began arriving in larger numbers as news reports and social media showed some being allowed to stay in the U.S."
