    "body": "LONDON—In England’s 55 years of waiting for another crack at a major-tournament final, nothing had caused it more sporting trauma than one of the simplest tasks in soccer: nailing a penalty shot from 12 yards out.<br />Penalty shootouts had dashed the hopes of English teams for decades, at World Cups and at European Championships. No matter how talented a squad was, it seemed there was always a devastating shootout in their future.<br />So as the Euro 2020 final ticked away on Sunday night, the dread of another one washed over Wembley Stadium. This time, it was Italy handing the Three Lions a crushing disappointment to rival any in a collection that spans more than half a century.<br />After 90 minutes of regulation and 30 more of extra time ended with the score at 1-1, the Azzurri held their nerve to become European Champions for the first time since 1968. And England had its signature heartbreak.<br />Two players from each side had already missed in the penalty shootout by the time 19-year-old England winger Bukayo Saka stepped up to the spot. Needing to score to keep his team alive, he could only watch as Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma dove to his left and met his shot with both hands."
