    "body": "The owner of downtrodden retail brands including JCPenney and Forever 21 plans to sell shares to the public, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br />Authentic Brands Group Inc. holds the license to more than 30 brands, including Sports Illustrated and Marilyn Monroe, as well as other well known retail names such as Brooks Brothers, Nine West and Eddie Bauer. The company gets most of its revenue from licensing fees.<br />It has partnered with mall owner  Simon Property Group Inc.  on the acquisition of some brands, including Aéropostale, Forever 21 and Penney, making it one of the bigger operators of physical stores at a time when more shopping is shifting online.<br />Authentic Brands had net income of $225 million in 2020 on total revenue of $489 million, according to the SEC filing.<br />The preliminary prospectus filed Tuesday doesn’t set an initial public offering price or place a valuation on the business. The filing says the company plans to sell $100 million worth of stock but that is a placeholder amount and will likely change."
