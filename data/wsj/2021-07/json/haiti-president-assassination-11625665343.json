    "body": "Gunman assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moïse early on Wednesday, storming his house in the capital. The country is bracing for unrest and uncertainty following the killing.<br />Unknown assailants entered the home of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse early Wednesday and shot him, said acting Prime Minister Claude Joseph. First lady Martine Moïse was also shot and hospitalized, Mr. Joseph said.<br />The motive for the killing isn’t clear. Haiti has been in increasing turmoil in the past few months, partly over a disagreement over when Mr. Moïse’s term ended. The president, elected in 2016, was due to step down in February, but said his term lasted another year. The opposition accused him of a power grab. Mr. Moïse was also pushing for a rewrite of Haiti’s constitution to allow the president to run for a second term and have more control over the armed forces. New presidential elections are scheduled for September.<br />The gunmen haven’t yet been identified. Mr. Joseph said some of the gunmen were speaking Spanish, and later suggested in interviews that the assailants may have been foreign mercenaries.<br />It means greater political uncertainty, likely violence, and economic decline in what is already the hemisphere’s poorest and least stable country."
