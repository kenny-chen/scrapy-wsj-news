    "body": "Donald Trump’s lawsuit against Big Tech is without merit (“Why I’m Suing Big Tech,” op-ed, July 9). The First Amendment does not apply to commercial contracts between private persons like the user agreements Mr. Trump entered into with social-media companies. Mr. Trump was barred from using the companies’ platforms because he violated the terms of his agreements. His sound and fury over his removal signify nothing. All kinds of commercial contracts limit one party’s speech rights. Mr. Trump knows this. He imposes censorship through the nondisclosure provisions in contracts he enters into with employees and others all the time.<br />Mitchell Seider<br />Scarsdale, N.Y.<br /><br />President Trump is right to criticize efforts by the left to control how social media handles news, but he’s doing the same thing. Both in and out of office, he worked to use government power to dictate how social media handles controversial news and views. Consider Mr. Trump’s Justice Department antitrust suit against Google or his executive order against Section 230."
