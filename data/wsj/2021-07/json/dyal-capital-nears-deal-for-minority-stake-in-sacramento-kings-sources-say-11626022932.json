    "body": "Dyal Capital is nearing a deal to make an investment in the Sacramento Kings National Basketball Association team, according to people familiar with the matter, as the firm works to assemble a portfolio of stakes across the league.<br />The deal, which could be announced as soon as this week, would give the investment firm a nearly 5% stake in the team at a valuation of $1.5 billion, the people said.<br />Dyal, a unit of the newly public Blue Owl Capital Inc.,  is best known for taking minority stakes in private-equity and credit firms. It would do the Kings transaction from its Dyal HomeCourt Partners fund, formed to provide liquidity and growth capital to teams across the NBA.<br />The deal would be its fundâ€™s second such transaction. On July 6, Dyal said it would take a similar-sized stake in the Phoenix Suns.<br />Dyal is initially hoping to raise about $1 billion for the fund and plans to build a portfolio of minority investments in six different teams, with a goal of eventually doubling that, according to people familiar with the strategy. It also could increase its stake in an existing holding if other minority owners are looking to sell."
