    "body": "Sadanand Dhume cites a Pew study in his column “Southern India Leads the Way to Tolerance” (East Is East, July 9). He mentions as evidence of prejudice that nearly three-quarters of India’s Hindu majority say that anyone who eats beef isn’t a Hindu. Mr. Dhume fails to mention that 77% of Muslims also say that a person cannot be Muslim if he eats pork.<br />India’s Hindu majority is vilified constantly, even though India’s minorities have grown and flourished since independence. I do not see any other country where you would find as many religions, languages and cultures coexisting peacefully.<br />Mr. Dhume writes, “You could come away reassured by the religious tolerance professed by Indians of all faiths, or worried by their marked preference for living apart in religious silos.” What are Little Italy, Little Havana, Chinatown and other such communities in the U.S. if not similar silos? Humans have a tendency to gravitate toward people with whom they have more in common. There is nothing wrong with that.<br />No country or people is perfect, but India’s record of tolerance and coexistence, and the Hindu majority’s role in it, should also be highlighted. You need only look at how religious minorities have fared in the countries neighboring India to understand this.<br />Nidhi Dixit"
