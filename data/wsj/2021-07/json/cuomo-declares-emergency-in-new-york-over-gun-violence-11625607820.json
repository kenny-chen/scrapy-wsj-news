    "body": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday declared a state of emergency over gun violence, which he said is now claiming more lives than Covid-19 and is a threat to the broader economic recovery.<br />The designation will allow the state to quickly release $138.7 million of funding for a series of initiatives, including summer recreation and violence interruption, which already operate in some areas of the state’s cities.<br />Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, also signed legislation that would allow people harmed by firearms to sue gun sellers and manufacturers if those entities acted recklessly and didn’t establish reasonable controls to prevent their products from being marketed or sold illegally in New York.<br />The new law, which is supported by gun-control advocates, is designed to circumvent a 2005 federal restriction of such suits. A spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms-trade association, said it plans to challenge the law in court.<br />The actions come as shootings in several of the state’s cities have increased from prior years. A recent poll found voters were more concerned about crime than education, and Mr. Cuomo said the perceived lack of safety could prevent the return of office workers to Manhattan and other urban centers."
