    "body": "The U.S. has declined Haiti’s request for U.S. troops to help stabilize the country after the assassination of its president, but is sending security officials to assess the situation, senior Biden administration officials said Saturday.<br />Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, has plunged into political uncertainty since the brazen killing of President Jouvenal Moïse. Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph has imposed a two-week state of emergency and his government asked the U.S. to deploy troops to protect infrastructure ahead of elections that had been slated for September.<br />U.S. officials said there are currently no plans to provide military assistance. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security officials are due to arrive in Haiti on Sunday as the Biden administration consults with Haitian authorities and international partners, the officials said.<br />The situation in Haiti is tenuous. “We need U.S. troops to help us provide security to the population, to efficiently confront the Covid-19 pandemic and to assist in the investigation of Mr. Moïse’s assassination,” a spokesman for Mr. Joseph said.<br />Three men claim they should be running Haiti."
