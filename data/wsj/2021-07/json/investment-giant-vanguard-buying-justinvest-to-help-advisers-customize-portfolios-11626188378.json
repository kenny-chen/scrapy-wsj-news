    "body": "Vanguard Group is buying JustInvest LLC, a smaller investing upstart that helps financial advisers build personalized portfolios.<br />The deal marks the first ever corporate acquisition by the world’s second-largest asset manager since Vanguard’s start in the 1970s. It brings together companies with radically different businesses: Investment giant Vanguard is best known for funds that track indexes. JustInvest provides tools for investors and advisers to build bespoke portfolios.<br />The purchase gives Vanguard another way to deepen ties with advisers. Vanguard oversees some $7.9 trillion in assets. Of that, about $3 trillion has already come into Vanguard through advisers, brokerages and other such middlemen.<br />Vanguard expects to announce its agreement to buy JustInvest as soon as Tuesday. Vanguard will gain over a dozen new employees and roughly $1 billion in assets managed by JustInvest through the purchase. It couldn’t be learned how much Vanguard is paying for the company.<br />Financial advisers using JustInvest’s software can, for example, quickly screen out oil polluters, take bigger positions in gun makers or automate the task of optimizing after-tax returns. Each client’s investments can then be managed separately. JustInvest’s legal name is one word, however the firm more commonly goes by Just Invest as two words."
