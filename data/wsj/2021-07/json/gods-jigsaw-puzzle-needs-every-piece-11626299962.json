    "body": "My teenage daughter, Molly, loves jigsaw puzzles. But I don’t care for them. They require patience, something I have in short supply.<br />And patience for what? Re-creating a picture that consists of far more nonessential than essential pieces. More parts of Mona Lisa’s background, for instance, than her enigmatic smile.<br />But it’s more than puzzles. For decades, this is how I approached people in my life without the mark of anything particularly interesting about them. I was impatient with life’s background pieces.<br />Winston Churchill had achieved much when he observed “we are all worms, but I do believe that I am a glow-worm.” My luminous self-regard was considerably less warranted. Then one day, I had a radical thought while watching Molly labor over a puzzle.<br />Perhaps it was because she was working on an image of the azalea-shrouded 13th green at Augusta National Golf Club, beauty I could readily appreciate. Here was my epiphany: Life is a jigsaw puzzle, and I’m looking at its pieces entirely wrong."
