    "body": "JERUSALEM—Israel’s new government lost a parliamentary vote early Tuesday to extend a temporary law that bars citizenship for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza who are married to Israelis, an early setback for the fragile ruling coalition.<br />The vote ended in a tie following a long night of debate, requiring a simple majority for the law to be extended. Fifty-nine lawmakers voted for it and 59 against in the 120-member Knesset.<br />The law, which was first enacted in 2003 and has since been renewed every year, is set to expire Tuesday at midnight. The failure to extend it exposes the deep ideological differences within the broad coalition. Two Arab lawmakers in the coalition abstained from the vote and a member of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s right-wing Yamina party voted against the law.<br />At the last minute, Mr. Bennett declared the vote would also be a confidence motion on the government. It survived because such a vote would require an absolute majority to fail.<br />Israel’s left-wing and Arab lawmakers, including many in the current government, say the so-called citizenship law discriminates against the country’s Arab minority. The right-wing parties, including that of Mr. Bennett, say the measure is needed to maintain security and preserve Israel’s Jewish character."
