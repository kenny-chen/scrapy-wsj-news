    "body": "Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder needed some help dealing with a tricky situation at work not long ago. He took advice from one of his favorite television shows.<br />“I don’t know if you watch ‘Ted Lasso,’” he said. “But sometimes your favorite animal is a goldfish because it has a memory of 10 seconds. That’s where we need to be.”<br />There was something curious about one of the NBA’s brightest minds borrowing a Ted Lasso pep talk. He could have leaned on decades of experience to get his basketball team past a stressful moment in the playoffs. He decided to invoke the folksy wisdom of a fictional American football coach managing an English soccer club.<br />It turns out he’s not the only person in professional sports channeling his inner Ted Lasso these days.<br />“It should be required watching for coaches,” Snyder said."
