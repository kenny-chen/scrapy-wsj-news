    "body": "Philip Morris International Inc.  agreed to buy  Vectura Group  PLC, a U.K. pharmaceuticals business specializing in inhaled medicines, for $1.24 billion in cash, bolstering its push to expand beyond tobacco and nicotine.<br />Philip Morris International, which is listed in New York but sells the Marlboro brand outside the U.S., on Friday said that Vectura will be the backbone of its inhaled-therapeutic business. The deal trumps an earlier agreement in May by Vectura to be bought by Carlyle Group Inc. Philip Morris’s offer of 899.2 million poundsvalues Vectura at 150 pence a share, 10% higher than the private-equity firm’s bid. Carlyle said Friday it is considering its options.<br />Shares in Vectura were trading 13% higher in London.<br />Philip Morris said the acquisition is part of its evolution into a broader healthcare and wellness company. Earlier this year, it outlined plans to generate more than half of its revenue from smokeless products by 2025, up from 24% in 2020.<br />Philip Morris said respiratory drug delivery and so-called self-care wellness products are key in its plans to move away from tobacco and nicotine. It said Vectura can help it tap into the fast-growing market for inhaled therapeutics."
