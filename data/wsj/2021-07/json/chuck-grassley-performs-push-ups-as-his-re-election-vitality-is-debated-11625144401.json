    "body": "SIOUX CENTER, Iowa—Continually proving your physical vitality is politically important when you are 87 years old and contemplating a bid for another six-year term in the U.S. Senate.<br />Push-ups were the technique of choice for GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley one evening earlier this week as he sought to show several hundred Republicans gathered here that he still has what it takes to belong to what has been called the nation’s most exclusive club.<br />Mr. Grassley, who has yet to announce if he will seek re-election next year in a race that has implications for party control of the Senate, was joined in the muscular demonstration by GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a possible 2024 presidential candidate nearly half his age. The two men performed 22 push-ups as a show of support for veterans.<br />The demonstration of stamina by Iowa’s senior senator, who was a bit winded after the performance, transpired as a debate among Iowans has broken out over whether Mr. Grassley has hit his political expiration date.<br />A decision by Mr. Grassley not to seek an eighth term would likely generate a competitive and potentially divisive Republican primary. It could also embolden Democrats nationally to try to invest more heavily in a state that former President Donald Trump won by more than 8 percentage points in November."
