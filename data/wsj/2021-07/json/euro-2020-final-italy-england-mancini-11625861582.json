    "body": "LONDON—While 60,000 fans inside Wembley Stadium steeled themselves for a penalty shootout last week, Italy captain Giorgio Chiellini seemed to be the only person unaware that this was a tense moment.<br />After 120 minutes of action against Spain in the European Championship semifinal, Chiellini approached the coin toss and started joking around. He laughed with the referee and teased his opposite number, Jordi Alba. But as anyone who has ever witnessed the spectacle of Italy in a major-tournament semifinal knows, Italian soccer is supposed to be melodrama, not comedy.<br />The difference this year is that Italy entered Euro 2020 with a drastic new approach. The team that was never among the favorites came here first and foremost to entertain. And if Italy is hard to recognize compared to previous, more successful iterations of the team, the country can have no complaints.<br />The fun, revamped Azzurri have a chance to become European champions in Sunday’s final against England. This opera buffa even has a catchphrase. Subverting the English rallying cry of “It’s coming home,” Italian fans promise that this week, “It’s coming Rome.”<br />“I thank the players, because they believed right from day one that we could produce something incredible,” Italy manager Roberto Mancini said. “Almost no one believed we could do it, and yet we’re into the final.”"
