    "body": "WASHINGTON—Amtrak said Wednesday it will spend $7.3 billion to replace aging railcars and locomotives, adding hundreds of new coaches with more comfortable seating, improved disabled access, individual power outlets and “a more contemporary food service experience.”<br />Siemens Mobility Inc. will manufacture the trains at its Sacramento, Calif., plant and comply with the Biden administration’s Buy America program, the railroad said.<br />The procurement is the largest single order in Amtrak’s 50-year history, a spokesman said. Among the trains that will be replaced are venerable Amfleet cars that have carried passengers in the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., and Boston—and on routes across the national network—for more than 40 years.<br />The order will include two types of dual-powered locomotives intended to improve environmental efficiency and cut down on travel times on some routes. Battery hybrid locomotives—diesel locomotives coupled with a battery car to allow for periods of all-electric power—will run on some state-sponsored routes, including in and out of New York’s Penn Station, the railroad said.<br />The battery-hybrid locomotives will be the first of their kind in use in the U.S., an Amtrak spokesman said."
