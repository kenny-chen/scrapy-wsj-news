    "body": "As governments roll out vaccination programs and lift coronavirus-induced restrictions on travel and leisure, the world’s demand for oil is slowly returning to normal.<br />The International Energy Agency in June forecast that global crude demand will return to its pre-pandemic high during 2022’s final quarter.<br />At the same time, resurgent consumption has driven a rebound in carbon emissions—even as some wealthy countries are accelerating their push toward low-carbon energy such as wind and solar power.<br />This leads to two crucial questions: Will the energy industry look back at the pandemic and say it was a temporary blip? Or will it see the past year as a time that fundamentally altered global energy demand and supply moving forward?<br />Wall Street Journal reporter David Hodari spoke with three energy experts about those questions. Tim Gould is head of energy-supply outlooks and investment at the International Energy Agency in Paris. Amy Myers Jaffe is managing director of the climate-policy lab at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Marianne Kah is a senior research scholar and advisory-board member at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation."
