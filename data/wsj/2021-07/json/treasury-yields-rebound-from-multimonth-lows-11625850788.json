    "body": "U.S. government bond yields regained ground Friday, bouncing off multimonth lows following four sessions of declines.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note notched its largest one-day climb in more than three weeks, settling at 1.354% compared with 1.287% on Thursday.<br />Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, have been trending lower for months, dragged down by investors re-evaluating their more optimistic economic forecasts. Helping drive that reassessment: reduced expectations for monetary stimulus and government spending, a run of underwhelming economic data and the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19.<br />The Treasury rally has wrong-footed many on Wall Street, forcing some investors to buy bonds to close out wagers on rising yields. That in turn has helped yields fall even further.<br />On Friday, yields rose early in the session and then continued higher in choppy trading, snapping a four-session streak of declines. Some analysts and investors said that the market was due for a pause after sharp drops in recent sessions and expect that yields will continue to rebound as the economy recovers."
