    "body": "LONDON—In the stressful months that preceded Euro 2020, as England manager Gareth Southgate contemplated his squad for the tournament, he had no idea what his strongest lineup might be this summer.<br />Southgate was staring at England’s most gifted crop of attacking players in a generation. There was potential to light up this European Championship with offense. England, for once, might even be fun to watch.<br />That’s when Southgate, one of the coolest heads in international soccer, decided to run in the other direction. If England was going to make its first final in 45 years, Southgate knew he would have to fix the back line first. He took an often ropey goalkeeper, a central defender prone to spectacular errors, a fullback once cast aside by Jose Mourinho, and a monolith nicknamed Slabhead and turned them into the best defense in the European game.<br />Through five games at this tournament, including Saturday night’s 4-0 drubbing of Ukraine in the quarterfinals, England has yet to concede a single goal. England will play Denmark in the semifinals on Wednesday in London, a day after Italy and Spain face off in the other semi.<br />“That’s what we’re building on,” captain Harry Kane said after his side punched its ticket to Wednesday’s semifinal against Denmark. “It’s the final part of winning games and winning tournaments.”"
