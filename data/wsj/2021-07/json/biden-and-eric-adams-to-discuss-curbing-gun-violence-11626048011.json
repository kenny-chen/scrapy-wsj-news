    "body": "President Biden will meet with Eric Adams, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, and a group of local leaders and law-enforcement officials as the White House seeks ways to curb gun violence.<br />Mr. Adams, a former New York Police Department officer who claimed the Democratic nomination for mayor last week, made public safety the centerpiece of his campaign. The Biden administration is working to counter rising crime in many cities as the nation reopens from the pandemic.<br />The boost in crime has generated criticism from Republicans who contend that Mr. Biden and Democrats have failed to respond sufficiently. Republicans have sought to tie it to a push by activists and some Democratic lawmakers to defund police departments in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer last year.<br />Mr. Biden has opposed defunding police departments. During his 2020 campaign, he supported funding increases for community policing, the use of body cameras and more transparency on police records.<br />In the last three months of 2020, homicides increased 32.2% in cities with populations of at least a million, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s Quarterly Uniform Crime Report."
