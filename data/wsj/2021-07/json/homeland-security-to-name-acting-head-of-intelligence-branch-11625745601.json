    "body": "The Department of Homeland Security is expected to announce John Cohen as the new acting head of its intelligence branch, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The move would come more than six months after that branch failed to issue any warnings about the Jan. 6 assault on Capitol to its partner law-enforcement agencies.<br />Mr. Cohen is currently DHSâ€™s counterterrorism coordinator and assistant secretary for counterrorism and threat prevention. In his new role, Mr. Cohen is expected to retain his position as counterterrorism coordinator, one of the people said. Mr. Cohen previously held both the intelligence role and the job as counterterrorism coordinator during the Obama administration.<br />In recent months, a different acting official, Melissa Smislova, has been overseeing the intelligence branch, known as the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. Mr. Cohen is expected to take over her duties.<br />Nearly six months into the Biden administration, the intelligence office remains without a Senate-confirmed leader as the department steps up efforts to address threats of extremist violence."
