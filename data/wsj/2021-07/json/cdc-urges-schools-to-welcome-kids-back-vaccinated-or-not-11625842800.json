    "body": "Schools should stay open this fall with some precautions in place, even where Covid-19 cases are rising, federal officials said, edging some of the nation’s most communal spaces closer to pre-pandemic norms.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that teachers and students who are vaccinated against Covid-19 don’t need to wear masks in schools. Unvaccinated adults and children under 12, for whom vaccines haven’t yet been authorized in the U.S., should wear masks and students of all ages should continue to learn 3 feet apart, the CDC said.<br />Where that isn’t possible, the CDC said, classes should be held anyway in conjunction with other precautions like ventilation and cleaning. Even where Covid-19 cases are rising as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads, the CDC said that all students and teachers should continue to meet in person and that those who are unvaccinated should be tested weekly.<br />The guidance advances the CDC’s incremental rollback in recent months of measures adopted to prevent the spread of Covid-19. As vaccines have helped push new cases to a fraction of the peaks reached last winter, the CDC has moved in stages to relax its guidance on face masks, travel and schools.<br />“The one constant through this entire pandemic is change. We’re always monitoring,” said Erin Sauber-Schatz, lead for the CDC’s Community Interventions and Critical Populations Task Force."
