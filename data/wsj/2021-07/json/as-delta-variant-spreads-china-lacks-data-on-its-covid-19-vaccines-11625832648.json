    "body": "The spread of the Delta variant is raising fresh concerns about the efficacy of Chinese vaccines, which have been central to inoculation efforts in the developing world, as recent data shows the protection provided by Western vaccines waning against the highly contagious variant.<br />Chinese officials have been analyzing data from an outbreak of the Delta variant in southern China last month, while  Sinopharm  and Sinovac Biotech Ltd., the country’s leading Covid-19 vaccine developers, have said they are studying Covid-19 variants, including via lab experiments. Both companies have suggested that a third booster shot may be needed to boost protection after their current two-dose regimens.<br />A sales executive at Sinovac, who declined to be named, says trying to figure out how much protection its vaccine, CoronaVac, offers against Delta has become a top priority for the company, although setting up new studies abroad could take months.<br />The efficacy of the Chinese vaccines against the Delta variant, which has now spread to at least 98 countries, will affect how soon China can open its borders and impact the course of the pandemic throughout much of the developing world, where many countries are reliant on Chinese shots.<br />In China, which has yet to approve any foreign vaccine against Covid-19, more than 40% of its 1.4 billion people had been fully vaccinated as of June 24. The country is still relying on some of the strictest pandemic control measures in the world to control outbreaks."
