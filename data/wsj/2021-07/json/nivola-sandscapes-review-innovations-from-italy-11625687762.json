    "body": "<br /><br />Cold Spring, N.Y.<br />In 2017, an elegant new exhibition space opened in this town—adding another bastion of vanguard art to the Hudson Valley, about 20 minutes south of DIA Beacon and easily reached by the Metro-North Railroad. Describing itself as “a museum and research center dedicated to advancing scholarship and public appreciation of postwar and contemporary Italian art in the United States,” Magazzino—“warehouse” in Italian—was founded by the collectors Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu, her husband, to advocate for Italian artists from the beginning of Arte Povera (the couple’s initial passion) in the late 1960s to the present.<br />The well-proportioned galleries are housed in a purpose-built, sky-lighted building and a connected remodeled old industrial structure and surrounded by handsomely landscaped grounds. The 20,000-square-foot ensemble was designed by the Spanish architect Miguel Quismondo. Rotating exhibits of selections from the Olnick Spanu collection, organized by the museum’s director, Vittorio Calabrese, and his team, provide an opportunity to see, in depth, works by significant artists not often as well represented in American museums as their European reputations warrant."
