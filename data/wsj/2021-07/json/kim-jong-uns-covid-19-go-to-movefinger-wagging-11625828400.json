    "body": "SEOUL—Kim Jong Un, more so than his predecessors, has spread out responsibility among an elite group of North Korean government officials. Now, facing the worst home-front crisis of his nearly decadelong reign, the young dictator is making sure to share the blame.<br />At a Politburo meeting late last month, Mr. Kim warned that his country’s Covid-19 situation was grave. He slammed his technocrats for their “old way of thinking,” and threatened to replace them with those “fully prepared in terms of loyalty.”<br />North Korean state media, reporting on the meeting, didn’t specify what had gone wrong. Mr. Kim fired a variety of officials, in what was the biggest leadership shake-up in nearly a decade, according to an analysis by Tae Yong Ho, a former senior North Korean diplomat who defected and is now an opposition lawmaker in South Korea.<br />One of the demoted appears to have been North Korea’s top military official, Ri Pyong Chol. On Thursday, state media published photographs of Mr. Kim at Kim Il Sung’s mausoleum, a visit marking a major holiday on the anniversary of his grandfather’s death. Mr. Ri appeared in plain clothes and stood two rows back from his customary spot next to the North Korean leader.<br />The overhaul was in part due to an effort by Mr. Kim to reshape the way the North Korean government operates."
