    "body": "To appreciate the full picture of what Mark Cavendish is doing right now at the Tour de France—to understand why this story is so thrillingly emotional and unexpected that it’s making grown, grizzled cycling fans weepy—you’ve got to appreciate where Cavendish was, not terribly long ago.<br />And where was he?<br />He was all but out of the sport. Done. Kaput.
