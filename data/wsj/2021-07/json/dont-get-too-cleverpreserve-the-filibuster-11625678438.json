    "body": "F.H. Buckley argues that flaws in a law are seen more clearly in hindsight than foresight, so “Conservatives Should Oppose the Filibuster” (op-ed, June 28). He’d like a procedure that would allow a repeal of a law with 51 instead of 60 Senate votes.<br />No doubt experience helps unearth error, but Mr. Buckley ignores the ease with which the filibuster can stop bad legislation and the difficulty of repealing a bad law with a filibuster-free Senate. With the filibuster Republicans can block a bill with 41 senators, which they have had at all times since 1979 except for about six months in 2009. To repeal a bad law in a filibuster-free Senate, they would need control of the House, the Senate and the presidency, which they didn’t have from 1955 until 2003, and have had for only about six years since then. While waiting for this happy trifecta, a bad law can do a lot of damage, and it may have spawned supporting constituencies that make repeal more difficult.<br />Jim Dueholm<br />Washington<br />Mr. Buckley’s idea is great in theory but won’t work in practice. “It is easier to identify bad laws with the benefit of hindsight,” he writes, but reasonable people can disagree about which laws are bad. A law that is bad for me might be good for you. The passage of any law also creates parties with a vested interest in maintaining it and resisting repeal."
