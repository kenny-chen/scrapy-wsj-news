    "body": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.— A Confederate monument that helped spark a violent white supremacist rally has been removed from its stone pedestal.<br />Work to hoist up the statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee began early Saturday morning. Crews were also expected to take down a second Confederate monument.<br />Spectators lined the blocks surrounding the park, and a cheer went up as the statue lifted off the pedestal.<br />Police were on hand for the procedure, with streets blocked off to vehicular traffic by fencing and heavy trucks.<br />“Taking down this statue is one small step closer to the goal of helping Charlottesville, Virginia, and America, grapple with the sin of being willing to destroy Black people for economic gain,” Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker said in a speech as the crane neared the monument."
