    "body": "SOUTH JORDAN, Utah—Johnny and Joanna Galbraith are spending more this year on most items in their budget for their family of three young children.<br />Some changes they attribute to different spending habits as they ease into post-pandemic life.<br />Many others are caused by inflation, with overall consumer prices up 5% in May from a year earlier, the biggest surge since August 2008.<br />Inflation is being fueled by growing demand, as more people take flights to Florida or buy new clothes as they emerge from Covid-19 lockdowns. Supply pressures are also a factor, such as a container ship filled with goods getting stuck in the Suez Canal and companies’ difficulty finding employees.<br />The consumer-price index is the benchmark for inflation and measures what consumers pay for everyday items, including groceries, clothing, recreational activities and vehicles."
