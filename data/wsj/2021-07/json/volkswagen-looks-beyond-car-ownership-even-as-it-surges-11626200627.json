    "body": "Attempts to predict what the automotive industry will look like in 2030 only serve to highlight how uncertain its future really is.<br />On Tuesday,  Volkswagen  updated its long-term strategy under the tagline “new auto.” Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess and his team laid out how they saw the vehicle business changing this decade and how the company would use its scale as the market leader in Europe and China to take advantage.<br />Volkswagen expects electric vehicles to gradually replace traditional ones—so far so uncontroversial. But the market leader in Europe and China also is preparing for explosive growth in “software-enabled revenues.” Its presentation implied that this business might be almost as big as that of selling EVs by 2030.<br />The parallel is with smartphones:  Apple  gets much of its growth from selling services through its iPhones rather than the devices themselves. As cars become connected to the internet and updatable, in-vehicle services seem likely to proliferate. If cars ever become autonomous, freeing drivers to be passengers and even undermining the current dominant model of car ownership, demand for services could skyrocket.<br />Volkswagen isn’t the only one preparing to sell services.  Ford ’s  strategy day in May made much of the opportunities an “always-on” relationship with its customers might bring.  General Motors  has promised an investor event later this year to explore the area."
