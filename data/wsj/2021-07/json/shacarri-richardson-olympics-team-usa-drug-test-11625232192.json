    "body": "Sprinting star Sha’Carri Richardson, the best American hope for gold in the women’s 100 meters at the Tokyo Olympics later this month, failed a doping test for a chemical found in marijuana, invalidating her win in the U.S. trials and likely knocking her out of the Games in the event.<br />Richardson accepted a one-month suspension, as permitted under international anti-doping rules for testing positive for a substance of abuse, according to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.<br />Richardson’s period of ineligibility began June 28, the date of her provisional suspension. Her sanction was reduced to one month because her use of cannabis occurred out of competition and was unrelated to sport performance, and because she successfully completed a counseling program regarding her use of cannabis, according to USADA.<br />USA Track and Field uses Olympic-trials results to qualify athletes in individual events, but it’s possible the governing body could select Richardson for the Olympic 4×100-meter relay on Aug. 6.<br />“Sha’Carri Richardson’s situation is incredibly unfortunate and devastating for everyone involved,” USATF said in a statement Friday morning. “Athlete health and well-being continue to be one of USATF’s most critical priorities and we will work with Sha’Carri to ensure she has ample resources to overcome any mental health challenges now and in the future.”"
