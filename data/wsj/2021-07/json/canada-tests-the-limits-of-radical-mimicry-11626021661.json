    "body": "Regarding Lawrence Krauss’s “Canadians Follow U.S. Lead in Ripping Down Statues” (op-ed, July 1): That a past misdeed—what country does not have some black marks in its history?—should give rise to an almost immediate negation of Canada’s founding indicates a deeper malaise.<br />The country has always had difficulty justifying itself as distinct, except as a foil to the U.S. Those leading the charge against Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada’s first prime minister, in fact express a most un-Canadian impulse to copy their American neighbors in the happy business of tearing down and starting over, in l’esprit of Year Zero. But if we are to work from a blank sheet of paper, would a separate Canada even exist? They might wish to consider that question before they unseat the memory of those who created a country that is genteel and wonderful in its own way, and ponder why it remains so even now.<br />Scott Kilian-Clark<br />New York<br />"
