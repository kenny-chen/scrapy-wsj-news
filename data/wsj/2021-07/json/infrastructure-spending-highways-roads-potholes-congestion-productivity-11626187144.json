    "body": "Regarding “The Outlook: Highway Dollars Won’t Rev Up Economy” (U.S. News, July 6): The infrastructure framework is not only about highways, but a broad investment in ports, freight rail, bridges and other critical infrastructure that is in need of repair and replacement. Building out broadband networks can expand productivity and connect the country virtually, much as the Interstate Highway System did decades ago. Of the roughly 10% to 15% of the funding that would go toward highways and roads, most is for repairing existing highways to reduce congestion, leading to more economic efficiency, rather than building new roads.<br />The article quotes a University of Pennsylvania economist to suggest that our framework won’t add to productivity. But a recent study by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School analyzing our broad framework found that it would result in long-term GDP growth while lifting workers’ wages and even reducing the deficit over time. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in key infrastructure priorities that will make our economy more efficient and competitive.<br />Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio)<br />Washington<br />"
