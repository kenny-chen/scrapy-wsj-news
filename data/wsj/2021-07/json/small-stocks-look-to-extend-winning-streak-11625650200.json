    "body": "Small-cap stocks have been on a tear since last fall, and some investors expect them to keep booming.<br />The  index of small-cap stocks ended June with its ninth consecutive month of gains, its longest monthly winning streak since at least December 1986, according to Dow Jones Market Data.<br />The index has advanced 51% since the end of September 2020, when promising Covid-19 vaccine trials inspired confidence that the economic future was bright. The  benchmark of large-cap U.S. companies has risen 29% during that time.<br />Companies that benefit from customers getting back to shopping and dining out have helped push the small-cap index to new highs. Clothing retailer  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. â€™s shares have risen 121% this year. The company reported in May that its business swung to a profit in its first quarter. Restaurant chain  Cheesecake Factory Inc.  said last month that its sales were beating pre-pandemic levels so far in the second quarter. Its shares have gained 42% in 2021.<br />The small-cap index includes the same business sectors as the S&P 500, but is weighted more heavily toward several segments that tend to be sensitive to the state of the economy, such as financial and industrial companies, according to data from Refinitiv."
