    "body": "SÃO PAULO—Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was transported by air late Wednesday afternoon for medical treatment in São Paulo after his doctor diagnosed him with an intestinal obstruction earlier in the day in the capital, Brasília.<br />Doctors in São Paulo are to run exams on the president to determine whether he needs an immediate operation, Mr. Bolsonaro’s press office said.<br />Mr. Bolsonaro’s doctor, Antonio Macedo, who had examined him in Brasília, said the president had an intestinal obstruction after he complained of stomach pains, the press office said. It was unclear what had caused the obstruction or the condition of Mr. Bolsonaro, who is 66.<br />Earlier in the day, the former army captain had been admitted to an army hospital in the capital. His press office initially attributed his health problems to hiccups, adding that he was in good condition, without offering further elaboration.<br />The president has had abdominal problems since his 2018 campaign for president, when a deranged man stabbed him in the street as he was thronged by supporters. Doctors saved his life in the operating room, and Mr. Bolsonaro recovered and went on to win the country’s highest office. Doctors have operated on him an unknown number of times since the first surgery."
