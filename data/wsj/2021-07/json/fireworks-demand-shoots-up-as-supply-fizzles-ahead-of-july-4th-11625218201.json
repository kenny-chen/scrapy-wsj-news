    "body": "Demand for fireworks is exploding, but a nationwide shortage means some Americans may have a difficult time finding pyrotechnics for their Fourth of July celebrations.<br />Consumers can expect higher prices, as much as 25% higher for some items, as well as a more limited selection, according to retailers and industry organizations. In some regions, popular items such as artillery shells will be hard to come by. People who haven’t yet bought fireworks for the upcoming holiday weekend may have to visit multiple stores to find what they are looking for, or find new favorites, fireworks enthusiasts say.<br />It’s the latest in a year filled with shortages of many kinds, from sofas and lumber to the number of workers in restaurants and hotels.<br />Trevor Laporte, a water-damage technician based in St. Joseph, Mo., said he went to five different retail locations around Missouri and searched online to get fireworks for this weekend’s celebrations.<br />“I’m usually shopping at firework stores that are indoors rather than firework tents,” he said. “A lot of the fireworks tents that I have seen along the roads seem to be pretty picked over.”"
