    "body": "U.S. stock futures wavered ahead of data on the pace of hiring in June that will offer insights into the recovery of the labor market.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 were flat, indicating that the broad market index will open little-changed after the New York opening bell. The index is on track to post gains for the week. Contracts tied to the tech heavy Nasdaq-100 edged up 0.1%.<br />The jobs report has been a focal point for investors in recent months as they assess the labor marketâ€™s pace of healing. The strength of hiring and job creation is likely to influence when the Federal Reserve begins to pull back some of its loose monetary policies designed to aid economic recovery from the pandemic. Jobs data are due at 8:30 a.m. ET.<br />Economists expect another 706,000 jobs were added in June. Should the number come in stronger, investors may worry that the Fed will need to tighten policy sooner than anticipated.<br />That could weigh on richly valued technology stocks, which have benefited from low interest rates, said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management."
