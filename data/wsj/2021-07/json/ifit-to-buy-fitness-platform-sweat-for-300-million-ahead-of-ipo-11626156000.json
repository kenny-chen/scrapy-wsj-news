    "body": "IFIT Health & Fitness Inc. will acquire Sweat, an online fitness training platform, ahead of an initial public offering that is expected in the fall, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />IFIT is buying Sweat, which was co-founded by trainer Kayla Itsines and CEO Tobi Pearce in 2015, for around $300 million, some of the people said. IFIT plans to keep Sweat, which is based in Australia, as a stand-alone brand and Ms. Itsines and Mr. Pearce as executives.<br />IFIT is beefing up its content offerings ahead of its anticipated IPO. The company, which owns NordicTrack, was recently valued in excess of $7 billion in its most recent round of funding in late 2020 and is expected to attain a valuation in excess of that in its IPO.<br />Should the company debut as planned later this year, it is expected to tap a market hungry for fast-growing companies in the busiest year for public offerings on record. IFITâ€™s closest competitor,  Peloton Interactive Inc.,  made its debut in late 2019, and while its stock price has tumbled this year after a recall of its treadmills, investors had raced into the stock. Even with the pullback, Peloton shares have more than quadrupled from their IPO price.<br />IFIT, formerly known as Icon Health & Fitness Inc., has been moving swiftly with its IPO plans and confidentially filed papers recently with the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the offering."
