Here’s how to stream them—as well as a comfy romantic drama.<br />(Netflix)<br />“Virgin River,” a Netflix drama based on a series of romance novels by Robyn Carr, has a premise that is familiar to anyone who watches the Hallmark Channel during the holiday season. A woman from the big city moves to the woods to find happiness in the wholesomeness of small-town America. There, she finds community and love in the arms of a veteran.<br />In this series, created by a Hallmark vet, the woman is Alexandra Breckenridge’s Mel Monroe, a nurse practitioner and midwife who finds Virgin River after a life in Los Angeles. Her love interest is Martin Henderson’s Jack Sheridan, a former Marine struggling with PTSD who owns a local gathering spot called Jack’s Bar. The third season premieres Friday.<br />More than 3 billion minutes of the series’s 20 episodes were streamed in the first 10 days after the release of its second season, according to Nielsen, and it was the most-streamed program in its first full week of release on Nielsen’s list of most-streamed titles."
