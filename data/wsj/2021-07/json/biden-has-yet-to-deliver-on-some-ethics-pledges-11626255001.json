    "body": "WASHINGTON—Joe Biden pledged during his presidential campaign to overhaul the country’s ethics and campaign-finance laws, promising to usher in a new era of government transparency.<br />Six months into his presidency, Mr. Biden has been unable to deliver on many of his promises.<br />As a candidate, Mr. Biden said he would push legislation to establish a new federal ethics commission and propose a constitutional amendment mandating that candidates for federal office fund their campaigns only with public money—neither of which the administration has acted on.<br />Sprawling Democratic-backed legislation that would overhaul the country’s campaign-finance laws in other ways has stalled in Congress because of Republican opposition and resistance by moderates in the president’s own party to repeal the filibuster, which would allow the bill to move forward without GOP votes.<br />White House officials said the president remains committed to the proposals he outlined during the campaign, adding that they are in discussions with Capitol Hill about avenues for advancing them. “The president has established the highest ethical standards of any administration in American history,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said."
