    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The U.S. trade deficit widened in May, as American consumers and businesses stepped up purchases of imported products and materials amid a continued economic recovery.<br />The foreign-trade gap in goods and services expanded 3.1% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted $71.2 billion in May, the Commerce Department said Friday.<br />Imports rose 1.3% to $277.3 billion, while exports increased 0.6% to $206 billion.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted a trade deficit of $71.4 billion in May.<br />The gains in imports were fueled by purchases of industrial supplies such as crude oil, lumber, food and beverages as the U.S. economy opened up further from the pandemic-induced shutdown with the spread of vaccines. The growth followed a drop in March when disruptions to supply chains caused shipments into the U.S. to slow from a record pace set in February."
