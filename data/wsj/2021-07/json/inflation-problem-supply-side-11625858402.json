    "body": "Alan S. Blinder assures us that there is no need to worry about a return to the inflation of the past (“Don’t Worry Too Much About the Inflation Surge,” op-ed July 8). He might be less sanguine if he took into consideration the combined strength of several very powerful forces that are fueling U.S. aggregate demand.<br />It is not simply that this year the economy is receiving a record peacetime budget stimulus amounting to some 13% of gross domestic product at a time when the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the so-called output gap is only 3%. This massive budget stimulus is being supplemented by the easiest monetary-policy conditions in more than a decade and the drawdown of an estimated $2 trillion, or around 8% of GDP, in excess savings that were built up during the lockdown stage of the pandemic.<br />This makes it all too likely that, even if the current supply-side problems prove to be transitory, the economy will soon overheat under the impetus of the extraordinary amount of fiscal- and monetary-policy stimulus that it is receiving.<br />Desmond Lachman<br />American Enterprise Institute"
