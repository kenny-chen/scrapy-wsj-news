    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration’s acting commissioner, Janet Woodcock, is taking the highly unusual step of asking for a federal investigation of doctors within her own agency who met with the makers of an Alzheimer’s drug before the medicine’s recent approval.<br />Dr. Woodcock, in a letter made public Friday, called for the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, to review interactions between the drugmaker and FDA staff during the approval process.<br />The drug’s approval has been highly controversial, partly because of its annual price pegged at $56,000, and partly because evidence of the drug’s effectiveness was inconclusive.<br />During the time when the agency was considering the drug, called Aduhelm, FDA reviewers met with the company,  Biogen Inc.,  that makes the drug. They collaborated with the company to prepare a joint review document presented to an FDA panel of outside advisers at a public meeting in 2020. The watchdog group Public Citizen called in December for an inspector general investigation “to scrutinize the unprecedented close collaboration.”<br />A Biogen spokesman said, “We will, of course, cooperate with any inquiry in connection with a possible review of the regulatory process.”"
