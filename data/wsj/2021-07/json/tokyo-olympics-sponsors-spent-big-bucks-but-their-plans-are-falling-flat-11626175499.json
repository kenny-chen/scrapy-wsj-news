    "body": "TOKYO—When Asahi Breweries pledged more than $100 million to sponsor the Olympics in Japan, it envisaged stadiums of spectators from around the world chugging the “Tokyo 2020 Official Beer” and a spillover of favorable publicity.<br />Now that almost all spectators have been banned at the Games and the Japanese public’s concerns about Covid-19 infections are rising, Asahi’s investment risks turning flat.<br />Its plight is shared by some five dozen Japanese companies that collectively kicked in more than $3 billion for the Tokyo Olympics, the largest contribution from host nation businesses ever at the Games.<br />“If a brand was relying upon their ability to activate in the host city for over 16 days or even an expanded period post-Games, they probably didn’t make the right investment,” said Woody Thompson, executive vice president for Octagon, a sports-marketing firm owned by  Interpublic Group of  Cos.<br />Even in normal times, sponsoring the Olympics has downsides. Under the International Olympic Committee’s “clean field of play” policy, companies can’t plaster their names on stadium surfaces or athletes’ uniforms. There is also usually some political or other controversy brewing. Next year’s Winter Games in Beijing are already the target of calls for a boycott over human-rights issues."
