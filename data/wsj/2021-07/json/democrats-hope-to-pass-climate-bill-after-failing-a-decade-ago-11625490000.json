    "body": "WASHINGTON—The last time Democrats controlled the federal government, the party put forward a wide-ranging plan to put a price on carbon emissions, pushing to require companies to buy permits to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases under a so-called “cap-and-trade” program.<br />But the effort failed, with the bill foundering in the Senate after passing the House, and Democrats lost their majority in the House in the 2010 midterms.<br />More than a decade later, Democrats are once again hoping to use their control of the House, Senate, and White House to pass a major climate bill—and warning that they need to avoid the pitfalls of their last effort.<br />“The last time Democrats were in power in Washington, I watched as climate action took a back seat to other legislative priorities, wasting precious time and political power,” Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass.), one of the authors of the House bill, said in a recent advocacy video. “We are in danger of making the same mistake.”<br />With narrower control of the House and Senate, more private-sector investment in clean energy, and a greater sense of urgency on climate change than in 2009, Democrats are taking a different tack in 2021."
