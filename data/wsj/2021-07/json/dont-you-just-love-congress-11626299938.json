It’s sooo entertaining.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer reached into the barrel of the Democrats’ Mega Millions spending lottery Tuesday evening and the winning number is . . . $3.5 trillion! That will be the pick’em amount in the Democrats’ “budget blueprint” for Joe Biden’s spend-o-rama on climate, new entitlements and Medicare expansions.<br />But wait, there’s more!<br />Performing alongside on Capitol Hill we have the spectacle of 11 Republican senators who’ve “compromised” with President Biden and his Democratic partners on an infrastructure spending bill that could hit $1.2 trillion.<br />Notwithstanding the sideshow of Texas Democrats flying in chartered jets to hide out in D.C., what’s going on in Washington ain’t just fun and games, folks. No one has yet pocketed the trillions in the spending lottery. For now, they’re proposals. What comes next is the politicking. In fact, what comes next is going to be a mesmerizing scorpion dance between Democrats and Republicans."
