    "body": "Weeks before  Didi Global Inc.  went public in the U.S., China’s cybersecurity watchdog suggested the Chinese ride-hailing giant delay its initial public offering and urged it to conduct a thorough self-examination of its network security, according to people with knowledge of the matter.<br />But for Didi, waiting would be problematic. In the absence of an outright order to halt the IPO, it went ahead.<br />The company, facing investor pressure to list after raising billions of dollars from prominent venture capitalists, wrapped up its pre-offering “roadshow” in a matter of days in June—much shorter than typical investor pitches made by Chinese firms. The listing on the New York Stock Exchange raised about $4.4 billion, making it the biggest stock sale for a Chinese company since  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ’s IPO in 2014.<br />Back in Beijing, officials, especially those at the Cyberspace Administration of China, remained wary of the ride-hailing company’s troves of data potentially falling into foreign hands as a result of greater public disclosure associated with a U.S. listing, the people said.<br />Didi’s American depositary shares began trading in New York on Wednesday, just a day before the ruling Communist Party celebrated its centenary."
