    "body": "Traders are gearing up for a pickup in volatility following an unusually sleepy stretch for the stock market.<br />The gap between the S&P 500’s daily peak and trough narrowed to 0.62 percentage point in June. That was down from 0.98 percentage point in May, marking the lowest level of intraday volatility within a month since December 2019, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.<br />After a notably quiet stretch, many analysts are anticipating a break in the lull. The simplest reason: Trading desks tend to become more lightly staffed during the summer as employees take off for the holidays. That generally means there is less liquidity in the markets.<br />In turn, any surprising economic data, corporate news or monetary-policy news tends to “hit the market harder than they otherwise might,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in an emailed note.<br />“And since volatility and returns have a negative correlation, this dynamic can make for difficult investment environments,” Mr. Colas said."
