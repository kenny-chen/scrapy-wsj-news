    "body": "Twitter Inc.<br />Donald Trump wants back on social media. The former president on Wednesday sued Twitter,  Facebook Inc.,  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google to restore his accounts. He remains suspended from most social-media platforms following the Jan. 6 riot in the U.S. Capitol led by a mob of his supporters. Mr. Trump was the most prominent plaintiff seeking class-action status against the companies, claiming he was wrongly censored by them in violation of his First Amendment rights. Twitter shares lost 2.1% Wednesday.<br />JPMorgan Chase  & Co.<br />Work-from-home is dividing on Wall Street. Some banking titans like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are taking a hard-line approach, even though it might mean losing talent. JPMorgan’s investment-banking staff had been told to be back in the office by Tuesday, while sales, trading and research staff members were told to return full time in June. Many of the bank’s sales and trading staffers have already been in the office throughout much of the past year. Meanwhile,  Citigroup Inc.  and other rivals are touting flexibility, betting that a softer approach will help them poach top performers. JPMorgan shares fell 1.7% Tuesday.<br />Stamps.com Inc."
