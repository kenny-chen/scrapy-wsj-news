    "body": "The European Union is set to propose the creation of a new anti-money-laundering agency with direct powers to supervise financial companies, according to a document seen by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The agency would be part of a broader plan to address failures that have made the region a haven for financial crime. The European Commission—the EU’s legislative arm—is set to make the proposal later this month, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />The proposals are the EU’s most ambitious to date and come after several scandals tarnished its reputation. Repeated failures have caused consternation in Washington, where anti-financial-crime officials have often felt like the U.S. has had to step into a void left by Europe.<br />A European Commission spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />In 2018, the U.S. used its purview over dollar transactions globally to effectively shut down ABLV, a Latvian bank that became a haven for dirty money. Washington informed European authorities about the imminent crackdown just minutes before making an announcement."
