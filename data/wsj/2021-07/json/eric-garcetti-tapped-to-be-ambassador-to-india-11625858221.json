    "body": "President Biden plans to nominate Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to be ambassador to India, the White House said Friday.<br />Mr. Garcetti, who has been mayor of the nation’s second-largest city since 2013, was co-chair of Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign. His nomination, which had been expected, comes as Mr. Biden works to fill out his diplomatic team.<br />If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Garcetti would head to a country that has struggled with the pandemic, including one of the world’s worst Covid-19 surges in April and May. The coronavirus has left over 400,000 dead in the country and threatened Prime Minister Narenda Modi’s political strength.<br />The U.S. has shipped medical supplies to India and offered other assistance. Before the crisis, the Biden administration had sought to reaffirm ties with India and other allies in the region to counter a more assertive China.<br />In a statement, Mr. Garcetti said he was honored to accept the nomination, saying if confirmed he would “forge partnerships and connections that will help strengthen Los Angeles’ place on the world stage.”"
