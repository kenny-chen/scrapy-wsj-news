    "body": "The last time the Phoenix Suns and Milwaukee Bucks found themselves competing for the biggest prize in basketball, a few men in private offices huddled around telephones and listened to a coin flip.<br />The year was 1969. The Suns and Bucks were battling for the No. 1 pick in the draft, which would be determined by NBA commissioner J. Walter Kennedy flipping a coin, and the Suns earned the right to make the call when Kennedy chose a scrap of paper with their name on it.<br />They had strategized for this random act of chance by asking fans to vote for heads or tails, so they knew in advance what they would say as the phone line went silent and the commissioner flicked a half-dollar and the NBA’s future in the air.<br />The Suns called heads. It was tails. The Bucks got the pick and selected a player named Lew Alcindor, who would soon change his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.<br />It would take more than a half-century for the Suns and Bucks to meet again with so much at stake. But now they have gone from the league’s worst teams to the best, and they have found a better method of picking a winner than flipping a coin."
