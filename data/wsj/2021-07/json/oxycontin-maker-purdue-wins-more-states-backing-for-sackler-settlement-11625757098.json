    "body": "New York, Massachusetts and 13 other states signed on to a settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its Sackler family owners, improving the chances of court approval for their multibillion-dollar plan to resolve lawsuits over the opioid epidemic.<br />The proposed deal, laid out in court papers filed Wednesday, covers state attorneys general that had resisted previous offers from Purdue and the Sacklers. A majority of states are now on board with the settlement, which requires approval from the judge presiding over Purdue’s bankruptcy case.<br />States that haven’t signed on include California, Connecticut and Delaware.<br />The Sackler family members who own Purdue will now contribute an additional $50 million, on top of the roughly $4.28 billion settlement they previously agreed to. Also, at least $175 million in family foundations will be contributed to fight opioid addiction, court papers said, bringing the total settlement from the Sacklers to roughly $4.5 billion.<br />It is among the largest payments that individuals have made to resolve a law enforcement action in U.S. history."
