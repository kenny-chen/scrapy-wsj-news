    "body": "Microsoft Corp.  agreed to buy cybersecurity provider RiskIQ Inc., the companies said Monday, a deal that would add to Microsoft’s portfolio of security services amid a rise in high-profile online attacks.<br />San Francisco-based RiskIQ, founded in 2009, helps companies track their vulnerability to digital threats. That has become more important and more complicated as companies shift a growing share of their work online, both to reach customers and to connect employees remotely, Microsoft security executive Eric Doerr said in a blog post on Monday about the acquisition.<br />For companies that use cloud computing, “it’s increasingly critical to understand the full scope of their assets to reduce their attack surface,” Mr. Doerr wrote.<br />Microsoft didn’t disclose the deal’s terms. Representatives for Microsoft and RiskIQ didn’t immediately respond to inquiries.<br />Internet vulnerabilities have drawn mounting concern this year as examples proliferate of cyberattacks with wide-ranging effects. In May, the 5,500-mile Colonial Pipeline, crucial to the East Coast’s energy infrastructure, was temporarily shut down by its operator after a cyberattack, leading to gasoline shortages in some places."
