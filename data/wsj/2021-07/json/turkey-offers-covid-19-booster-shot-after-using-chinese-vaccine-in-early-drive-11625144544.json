    "body": "ISTANBUL—After an early drive to inoculate millions with a Chinese-made Covid-19 vaccine, Turkey started offering Thursday a booster shot to some people amid concerns over the spread of the highly transmissible Delta strain.<br />Turkey’s health minister, Fahrettin Koca, said it would offer a third vaccine dose to healthcare workers and people over the age of 50. That third dose isn’t dependent on which vaccine was used for the previous two. Turkey is currently using both the vaccine made by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  and another made by the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech Ltd.<br />“The choice is yours,” said Mr. Koca.<br />In response to questions from The Wall Street Journal, the Turkish Ministry of Health said that it is offering the booster shot because some healthcare workers and older people received their initial doses six months ago. At the time, Turkey was only offering the Sinovac vaccine.<br />Turkey isn’t the first country to offer booster shots to people who have received a Chinese-made vaccine. Bahrain has been giving Pfizer-BioNTech shots to people who received two doses of a vaccine made by Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm. The United Arab Emirates is giving third doses of the Sinopharm vaccine as doctors say the Chinese-made shots in some cases haven’t generated enough protective antibodies."
