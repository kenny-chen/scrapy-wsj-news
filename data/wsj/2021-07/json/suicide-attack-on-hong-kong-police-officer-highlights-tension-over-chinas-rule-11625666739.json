    "body": "HONG KONG—Few people appeared to notice the middle-aged man as he walked up to one of dozens of police officers patrolling one of Hong Kong’s busiest streets on the July 1 anniversary of the city’s return to Chinese rule.<br />The 50-year-old man dressed in gray pulled a knife out of his pocket and stabbed the officer in the back. As the officer staggered toward colleagues, the assailant stabbed himself in the heart and collapsed as officers rushed to subdue him. He died a short time later.<br />The evening attack, which was partly captured on video, signalled a potential shift to more extreme tactics by some government opponents, as police enforce China’s national-security law that has all but eliminated avenues for political dissent.<br />The response to the attack shows the deep divisions that persist in the city after authorities curtailed street demonstrations, jailed opposition figures and silenced dissenting voices.<br />Many have mourned the attacker, who was identified as Leung Kin-fai by a well-known beverage company where he worked as a purchasing manager. Some brought flowers to Causeway Bay, a busy shopping district where the attack took place. Others left messages on social media calling him a martyr."
