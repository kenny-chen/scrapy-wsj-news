    "body": "JERUSALEM—When a group of Jewish and Muslim Jerusalemites wanted to show that Israelis and Palestinians could coexist peaceably during a wave of communal violence, they joined to hand out cakes and cookies in their neighborhood of Abu Tor.<br />The gesture backfired. Palestinians who took part received death threats from callers who accused them of collaborating with Israel. Someone shot at the home of a prominent Palestinian leader. And the so-called Good Neighbors project—which runs language classes, set up a youth soccer team and hosts an informal cafe where people can meet—quickly shelved most of its work.<br />“We’ve taken many steps backward,” said David Maeir-Epstein, a member of the Good Neighbors project who helped hand out the sweets. “We don’t think that we’ve gone off the precipice, but it’s fragile—and you realize how quickly things can change.”<br />Israelis and Palestinians have been grappling with mounting tensions that have tested everyone from the country’s top officials to neighborhood organizers.<br />Protests in East Jerusalem over plans to evict dozens of Palestinian families from homes claimed by Jewish activists became a catalyst in May for an 11-day conflict with Hamas militants in Gaza. The battle with Hamas was part of a broader surge in violence in Israel and the West Bank."
