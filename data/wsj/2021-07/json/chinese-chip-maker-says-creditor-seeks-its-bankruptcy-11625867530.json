    "body": "Tsinghua Unigroup Co., a key player in China’s push for self-reliance in semiconductors, said Friday that one of its creditors has asked a court to begin bankruptcy proceedings for the group.<br />The state-backed chip maker said it had received a notice from a Beijing court saying that  Huishang Bank Corp Ltd. , a Hong Kong-listed bank based in Anhui province, has requested the court to start bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings, on the grounds that it has failed to repay its debts, according to a Unigroup filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.<br />Unigroup said in a statement on its website that it would cooperate with the legal proceedings and alleviate its debt risks, while helping the court defend creditors’ interests.<br />The financial difficulties are striking for a company which in 2015 made headlines with an unsuccessful $23 billion bid for U.S. memory-chip maker  Micron Technology Inc.  A 2019 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development study of 21 global semiconductor companies ranked Unigroup at the top for government support received from 2014 to 2018.<br />The request by the bank for Unigroup to be forced into bankruptcy protection is recorded in the National Enterprise Bankruptcy Information Disclosure Platform, a platform for the public to access information related to bankruptcy cases in China."
