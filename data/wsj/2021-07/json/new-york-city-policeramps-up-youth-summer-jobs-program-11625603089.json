    "body": "The New York Police Department is expanding its summer-jobs program for young people, officials said, in new attempts to build relationships and encourage recruitment after a year of rising violent crime.<br />More than 750 New York youths aged 14 to 21 years old will find work in the NYPD’s Summer Youth Employment Program this year, up from last year when the program had roughly 400 slots, according to NYPD officials.<br />Unlike in previous years, the NYPD has expanded the program this summer to place at least three youths in each of the city’s 77 precincts, as well as its special divisions such as the aviation unit, the harbor unit and the legal bureau. The paid, part-time roles, which began this month and run into September, provide mentoring and job experience, officials said.<br />NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Community Partnerships Chauncey Parker said that the NYPD is working to build partnerships with young people through other programs such as funding the renovation of basketball courts with assets seized in criminal cases.<br />The rise in violent crime during the Covid-19 pandemic heightened the need for partnerships between officers and the community, Mr. Parker said. “They’ve never been more important than they are at this moment,” he said."
