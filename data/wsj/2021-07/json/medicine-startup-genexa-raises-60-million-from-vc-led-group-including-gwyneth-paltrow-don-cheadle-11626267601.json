    "body": "Over-the-counter medicine company Genexa Inc. raised $60 million of funding from venture-capital firms and celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. The round values the company at roughly $200 million.<br />The company is the latest to capitalize on the so-called clean-health and wellness trend, in this case reducing synthetic ingredients in pain and fever, cold and flu, and allergy medicines for children and adults.<br />Genexa’s medicines contain the same active ingredients as other over-the-counter options, and they are manufactured in accordance with Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The key difference, the company says, is that it has replaced the typical fillers with a patented preservative system that is free of artificial dyes and common allergens.<br />It is entering a space dominated by behemoths—including  Johnson & Johnson  and  GlaxoSmithKline  PLC—and winning market share is an uphill battle, a concept that isn’t lost on the two co-founders, David Johnson and Max Spielberg. Neither has a medical background, but they brought on Brian Perkins, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, as chairman.<br />“The industry that we’re disrupting is a massive industry,” said Mr. Johnson. “For us to really effect change, capital is required.”"
