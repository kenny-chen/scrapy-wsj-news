    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden fired Social Security Commissioner Andrew Saul Friday after Mr. Saul declined a request to resign, the White House said, accusing Mr. Saul of politicizing Social Security disability benefits.<br />The president also asked for the resignation of the deputy Social Security commissioner, David Black, who the White House said agreed to step down. Both men were appointed by President Trump.<br />Social Security is one of the federal government’s largest programs, paying regular retirement, disability and survivor’s benefits to millions of Americans.<br />Mr. Biden has appointed Kilolo Kijakazi as acting commissioner, the White House said. Ms. Kijakazi is the deputy commissioner for retirement and disability policy at the agency.<br />Republicans criticized the firing of Messrs. Saul and Black, arguing that their terms weren’t set to expire until 2025. “This removal would be an unprecedented and dangerous politicization of the Social Security Administration,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote on Twitter."
