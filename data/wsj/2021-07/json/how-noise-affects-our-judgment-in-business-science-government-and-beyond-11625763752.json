    "body": "Editor’s note: this transcript excerpt has been edited for clarity and length.<br /><br />In expertise we trust: Throughout business, science, medicine and the law, we count on the experience and training of those in carefully vetted roles to deliver consistent information and judgments. But what if we are, collectively, unable to spot the way human variability undermines that consistency?  What if medical diagnoses of the exact same symptoms differ hugely?  What if judges are swayed as much by the time of day or other happenstance?  What if, in our quest to make institutions free of unfair bias, we are overlooking an even wider cause of misinformation and injustice?<br /><br />In “Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment” (Little, Brown Spark, 464 pages, $32), Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass R. Sunstein explain how noise undermines the workings of professionals in fields such as medicine, law, and economics, while it interferes with tasks like hiring and evaluating personnel in every industry. Wherever there is judgment, they argue, there is noise—and we are largely unaware of its power. Fortunately, the authors  not only a highlight a problem, but offer some powerful remedies."
