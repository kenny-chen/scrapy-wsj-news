    "body": "BÉZIERS, France—Ten-year-old Riyad El Baroudi faces a dilemma whenever it’s time to sit down for lunch at his elementary-school cafeteria.<br />His father forbids him to eat pork in accordance with Islamic laws. But in January, local authorities streamlined meals at public schools across Béziers, a hilltop town in southern France, and now pork is often the only meat on the menu.<br />“This is a provocation,” said Rachid El Baroudi, Riyad’s father.<br />Public schools across France have become the front lines of a struggle between segments of France’s large Muslim population and proponents of laïcité, the country’s strict separation of religion and state. Many Muslim families say authorities are broadening their interpretation of laïcité—applying it to everything from what’s served in the cafeteria to whether Muslim mothers can chaperone field trips wearing head scarves—in ways that target Muslims for their religious beliefs.<br />Teachers, administrators and French officials say they are pushing back against a decadeslong cultural shift, in which schools have come under pressure to accommodate the religious beliefs of many French Muslims in ways big and small. The pressure, they say, is undercutting a republic built on the principle of laïcité as well as the values of equality, liberty and fraternity."
