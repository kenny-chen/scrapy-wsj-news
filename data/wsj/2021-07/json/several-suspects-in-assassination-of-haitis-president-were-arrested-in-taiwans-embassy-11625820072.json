The spokeswoman, Joanne Ou, added that the Haitian National Police are investigating the case.<br />On Thursday, Haitian authorities said that 17 people had been arrested. A day earlier, Haiti’s police chief said that four suspects were fatally shot and that two others were captured.<br />Haiti, a Caribbean nation on the U.S.’s doorstep, is one of 15 countries with which Taiwan has formal diplomatic relations. Taipei was quick to condemn what it called a “violent and barbarian act” and back the interim government."
