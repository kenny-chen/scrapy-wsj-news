    "body": "Wells Fargo  & Co. posted its highest revenue since before the pandemic began as its fortunes revived along with the U.S. economy.<br />The San Francisco-based bank said Wednesday that its revenue rose 11% from a year ago to $20.27 billion, topping the $17.76 billion analysts had expected. That was due to fees and other noninterest income, which rose 37% from a year earlier to $11.47 billion.<br />Wells Fargo was the only lender among the four biggest to post an increase in revenue last quarter. It was aided by one-time gains, including higher valuations on its venture capital and private-equity investments. Mortgage banking income also quadrupled from a year earlier to $1.34 billion.<br />The bank’s results suggested it is beginning to make progress repairing its business nearly five years after its fake-accounts scandal ruined its reputation and led to revenue declines across its business.<br />“We believe we are doing what’s necessary to improve the underlying earnings power of the company,” Chief Executive Charles Scharf said in a statement."
