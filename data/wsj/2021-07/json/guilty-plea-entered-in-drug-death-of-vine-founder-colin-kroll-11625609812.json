    "body": "The leader of a drug-trafficking organization pleaded guilty Tuesday in Manhattan federal court to conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine and fentanyl, including the drugs that caused the 2018 death of Colin Kroll, the co-founder of the video-hosting service Vine and the trivia game application HQ Trivia.<br />Ariel Tavarez ran an on-demand delivery service known as “Mike’s Candyshop” that sold addictive and dangerous drugs to customers throughout New York City, Manhattan U.S. attorney Audrey Strauss said. She said Mr. Tavarez sometimes secretly laced drugs with deadly synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl.<br />“Thanks to the tireless efforts of law enforcement, Mike’s Candyshop is permanently closed,” Ms. Strauss said.<br />Mr. Kroll, the 34-year-old startup chief executive, was discovered dead in his Manhattan apartment in 2018, and the New York City medical examiner’s office later ruled the cause of death to be an accidental overdose by fentanyl-laced heroin.<br />An investigation showed that Mr. Kroll had ordered narcotics by text messaging the Candyshop delivery service several times from his cellphone, including the day before his death. Customers texted their delivery orders for heroin and cocaine to what was known as the Candyshop Number, which sold only to customers who had referrals, according to prosecutors."
