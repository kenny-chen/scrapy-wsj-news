    "body": "It was late at night in the United States but very early in the morning in Greece, when a reporter named Christos Tsaltas took his customary place in the corner of a Zoom screen and introduced himself to an NBA star.<br />“Hello, Bam,” he said to Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat. “I would like to ask you…”<br />This polite greeting is how the league’s most prolific interviewer begins most of his questions. And he has a lot of them. Tsaltas has so much that he would like to ask players that he can’t limit himself to one question. “And also…” he says as he sneaks in another.<br />Before he answered either question, Adebayo had something to ask Tsaltas.<br />“First of all, my man, what time is it over there?”"
