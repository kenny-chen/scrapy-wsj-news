The Iraqi government has ordered an investigation into the cause of the fire, which continued after midnight local time.<br />Following an emergency meeting with ministers and top security officials, Iraq Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi suspended the hospital director, the head of the regional health department and the province’s head of civil defense. He also ordered that all three be detained during the investigation.<br />The fire amplifies the public pressure on Iraq’s government as it deals with crumbling infrastructure, an continuing economic crisis, the coronavirus pandemic and an array of security problems."
