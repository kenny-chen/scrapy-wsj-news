    "body": "HONG KONG—Chinese regulators ordered app store operators in the country to remove the mobile app of Didi Global Inc.’s China service on Sunday, dealing a second blow to the ride-hailing giant less than a week after its U.S. stock market debut.<br />The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet watchdog, citing serious problems involving illegal collection of personal data, also instructed Didi Chuxing, the company’s China business, to address the issues to “ensure the safety of the personal information of users.”<br />Beijing’s latest order comes just two days after regulators blocked Didi Chuxing from adding new users as regulators review the company’s cybersecurity practices.<br />It also came a day after Didi’s vice president, Li Min, took to social media to rebut reports that Didi stored user data in the U.S.<br />In a message posted on China’s  Twitter -like Weibo service, Mr. Li threatened to sue anyone who claimed the company transferred its domestic data abroad. “Like many overseas-listed Chinese companies, Didi stores all domestic user data on servers in China. It is absolutely impossible to pass data on to the United States,” he wrote."
