    "body": "Johnson & Johnson â€™s  Covid-19 vaccine showed promising signs in a small laboratory study of protecting against the Delta variant spreading across the U.S. and other countries, the company said.<br />In laboratory testing, the vaccine triggered a strong immune response in blood samples taken from eight vaccinated people, J&J said Thursday.<br />The positive performance adds to a growing set of evidence indicating currently authorized Covid-19 vaccines can safeguard against the Delta variant, which appears to be more contagious than earlier strains.<br />How well the J&J shot fares against the Delta variant has been closely watched by health authorities around the world.<br />Many countries have been counting on supplies, especially because the vaccine is simpler to ship, handle and store than the shots from  Pfizer Inc.  and its partner  BioNTech SE  and from  Moderna Inc."
