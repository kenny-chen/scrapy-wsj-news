    "body": "NortonLifeLock Inc.  is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm  Avast  PLC, according to people familiar with the matter, in a deal that would expand the U.S. company’s focus on consumer software.<br />A deal could be finalized this month, assuming talks don’t fall apart, the people said. Avast has a market value of around £5.2 billion ($7.2 billion). Assuming a typical deal premium, the deal could value the company at more than $8 billion.<br />Avast, which is based in Prague but trades in London, primarily makes both free and premium security software for consumers such as desktop security and server and mobile-device protection. The company says it has 435 million active users and its 2020 revenue was roughly $893 million.<br />The deal would be a big one for NortonLifeLock, based in Tempe, Ariz. With a market value of about $16 billion, the company was known as Symantec Corp. before it closed a $10.7 billion deal to sell its enterprise-security business to  Broadcom Inc.  in 2019. What is left mainly sells Norton antivirus software and LifeLock identity-theft-protection products to consumers.<br />The company had attracted takeover interest of its own a few years ago, including from private-equity firms and a corporate suitor, but nothing has come of it."
