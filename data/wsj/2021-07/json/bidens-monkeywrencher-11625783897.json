    "body": "“P.S. You bastards go in there anyway and a lot of people could get hurt.”<br />Thus reads a note sent in 1989 to the U.S. Forest Service by Tracy Stone-Manning, now President Biden’s nominee to run the Bureau of Land Management.<br />Presidents are generally entitled to personnel picks. An exception might be a nominee who ran with eco-terrorists—who collaborated with Earth First! saboteurs, known for spiking trees to halt timber sales, and who misled senators about the nature of her involvement.<br />Mr. Biden put Ms. Stone-Manning forward in April, and she isn’t new to politics. The environmental radical has worked for Sen. Jon Tester and former Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, and more recently at the National Wildlife Federation. She’s spent a lifetime protesting fossil-fuel production, logging, mining and public access to federal land.<br />The Earth First! story also isn’t new, though over the years Ms. Stone-Manning crafted a heroic version. In that tale, told in various forums over the years, she was an innocent graduate student at the University of Montana in Missoula. In 1989, a “frankly, frightening” and “disturbed person” from Earth First! asked her to mail a warning letter about tree spiking, which is designed to kill or maim loggers and mill workers. She agreed, because “she didn’t want anybody getting hurt.” In 1993 she nobly testified against the spikers, helping send two to prison. A Biden official said that Ms. Stone-Manning has always been “honest and transparent” about her history."
