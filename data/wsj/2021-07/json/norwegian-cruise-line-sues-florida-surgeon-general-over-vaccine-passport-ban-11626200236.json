    "body": "Norwegian Cruise Line  Holdings Ltd. has sued Florida’s surgeon general, challenging the state’s barring of businesses from requiring proof of Covid-19 vaccination and intensifying the standoff between the company and Florida.<br />The cruise operator is sticking with its policy to require full vaccinations for all crew and passengers, including children, for initial sailings through Oct. 31 after more than a yearlong hiatus and billions of dollars in losses. That policy, if maintained in Florida, would result in the company being fined up to $5,000 for each passenger affected, it said.<br />The Miami-based company filed the lawsuit Tuesday against Scott Rivkees, the state surgeon general, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Norwegian asked the court to block and declare unlawful the enforcement of the ban on requiring proof of vaccination. Norwegian only sued Dr. Rivkees because he is the state official who has authority to enforce the ban, according to the company’s complaint.<br />Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in May said, “Your personal choice regarding vaccinations will be protected, and no business or government entity will be able to deny you services based on your decision.”<br />The Florida Department of Health didn’t respond to a request for comment."
