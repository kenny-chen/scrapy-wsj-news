    "body": "Instacart Inc. named technology industry veteran Fidji Simo as its new chief executive, as the grocery delivery company seeks to expand its business and go public.<br />Ms. Simo spent the past decade at  Facebook  Inc.,  leading the social media giant’s mobile and products teams and helping transition it from a private business to a public company. She joined Instacart’s board in January.<br />“I can’t think of a better leader to take the company public” and be at the helm, said Apoorva Mehta, co-founder and CEO of Instacart, who will become executive chairman of the board next month.<br />San Francisco-based Instacart has been among the biggest beneficiaries as Covid-19 concerns and restrictions reordered the U.S. business world. The company, which deploys shoppers to pick up groceries from supermarkets and deliver them to customers, got a boost as more consumers shifted their shopping online in the pandemic. Instacart also works with manufacturers to offer discounts on its platform and builds websites and mobile applications for retailers.<br />Ms. Simo joins Instacart as the company and other delivery providers face new challenges after a banner year of growth. More people are buying groceries online today than they did before the pandemic but companies are still struggling to turn a profit. Labor and transportation costs continue to eat into profit margins. Competition is intensifying, too, as rival food delivery companies pitch favorable deals."
