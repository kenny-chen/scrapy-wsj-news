    "body": "AUSTIN, Texas—Dozens of state House Democrats fled Texas on Monday to deny the Republican-controlled state legislature the quorum necessary to pass voting legislation during a special session.<br />Democratic House members said they were boarding chartered airplanes bound for Washington, D.C., where they hope to draw national support for their fight against the bills. At least 59 of the body’s 67 Democrats were expected to participate in the walkout, according to a source familiar with the plans, but the final number may not be known until the House is called to order Tuesday morning.<br />The legislators will have to remain out of state for weeks to avoid voting during the 30-day legislative session, which Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called after a previous walkout by Democrats shortly before a voting deadline killed the legislation at the end of the body’s regular session in May.<br />The bill that was considered in May would have set some of the nation’s broadest restrictions on voting. Mr. Abbott called the legislation a matter of election security, and an emergency. Democrats say the legislation is aimed at preventing their supporters, including many minority group members, from voting.<br />After Democrats killed the vote by staging a walkout this spring, Mr. Abbott called the special session for a legislature that typically meets for only five months every other year."
