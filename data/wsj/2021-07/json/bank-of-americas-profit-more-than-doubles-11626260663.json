    "body": "Bank of America Corp.  said the economic rebound helped to more than double its profit, but low rates weighed on its revenue.<br />The nation’s second-largest bank by assets posted earnings Wednesday of $9.22 billion in the second quarter, up from $3.53 billion a year earlier. The bank earned $1.03 per share, beating the 77 cents forecast by analysts polled by FactSet.<br />Bank of America’s bottom line was lifted by its decision to release $2.2 billion of reserves it had set aside during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic to protect against a wave of soured loans. Like peers including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America has been releasing its loan-loss stockpiles as the U.S. economy rebounds.<br />“Consumer spending has significantly surpassed pre-pandemic levels, deposit growth is strong and loan levels have begun to grow,” CEO Brian Moynihan said.<br />Bank of America and its peers sit at the center of the U.S. economy. They have benefited from the reopening of businesses, record-high stock prices and people’s increased willingness to spend after a year of hunkering down."
