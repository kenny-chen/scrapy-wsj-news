    "body": "<br />Sci-fi works off second-order effects, and beyond. Imagining the internal-combustion engine is well and good, but to make a story out of it, you have to think up gridlocked streets or a high-speed chase. So what are the second-order effects of a pandemic?<br />In the real world, right now, not so startling, not sci-fi startling at any rate. People are getting back to normal, and what they’re thinking is, the new normal won’t be so very different from the old normal.<br />But what about a pandemic which was 90% fatal? And which affected only males? That’s the situation in Christina Sweeney-Baird’s “The End of Men” (Putnam, 401 pages, $17). Some effects are easy to predict. There has to be food rationing, along with a draft of young women to replace all the truck drivers and plumbers and garbage disposal workers who aren’t there any more.<br />Less immediately obvious: Baby boys, precious and vulnerable, now must be whisked away by midwives in hazmat suits. There are child quarantine units for young boys, set up in remote areas. Governments run by women now have Male Relations Departments—though they might need less in the way of foreign relations, as national rivalries have cooled down."
