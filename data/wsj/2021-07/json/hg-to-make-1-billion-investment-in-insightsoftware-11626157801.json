Genstar and ST6 will stay on as minority shareholders in the company.<br />Based in Raleigh, N.C., insightsoftware makes financial-reporting and performance-management software used by over 28,000 customers. As it has grown, insightsoftware has also expanded its product offerings to budgeting, planning, tax, disclosure and other types of software.<br />The idea behind the company “was to build the leading enterprise software vendor to the office of the [chief financial officer], one that could handle all of their needs,” said Hythem El-Nazer, managing director at TA. Since its 2018 founding, insightsoftware has made 17 acquisitions and its revenue has grown from about $35 million to about $350 million, with a goal to hit $1 billion in the next few years, said Mr. El-Nazer."
