    "body": "As the world’s attention moves away from Cuba and its Sunday protests, we shouldn’t forget the brave individuals being rounded up and brutalized by the government of Miguel Díaz-Canel.<br />His crackdown has been vicious. Cuban police in riot gear, military troops and paramilitary groups have been unleashed on civilians and the press trying to chronicle events. Thanks to cell-phone technology, much of this ugly stuff is available for the world to witness.<br />Multiple images have captured state security wrestling demonstrators into custody or knocking them down and pummeling them on the ground. One video shows plain-clothes agents chasing a young Cuban to the roof of a building, where they beat him with batons until he collapses. Another video shows police firing on civilians in Havana.<br />Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosa’s face was bloodied by police while covering the protests. According to AP, a mob of pro-regime activists also “assaulted an AP cameraman, disabling his camera.”<br />Cuban dissidents Guillermo Fariñas, former political prisoner José Daniel Ferrer and artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara have been arrested, along with at least 190 others. The whereabouts of some aren’t known."
