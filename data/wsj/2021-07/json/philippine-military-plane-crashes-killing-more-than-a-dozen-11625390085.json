The aircraft had 92 people on board, including three pilots and five crew and the rest were army personnel, he said.<br />The plane crashed on landing shortly before noon Sunday in Bangkal village in Patikul, in Sulu province, military chief of staff Gen. Cirilito Sobejana said.<br />It was transporting troops from southern Cagayan de Oro city for deployment in Sulu, Gen. Sobejana said. Government forces have been battling Abu Sayyaf militants in the predominantly Muslim province of Sulu for decades.<br />It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the crash. Regional military commander Lt. Gen. Corleto Vinluan said it was unlikely the aircraft came under fire and cited witnesses as saying that it appeared to have overshot the runway."
