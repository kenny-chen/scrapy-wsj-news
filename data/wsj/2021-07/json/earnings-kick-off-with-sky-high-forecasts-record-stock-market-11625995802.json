    "body": "Wall Street is heading into earnings season this week with high expectations after strong profits fueled a stock market rally in the first half of the year.<br />Money managers will be watching whether companies will again trounce Wall Street’s forecasts for earnings. The S&P 500 has gained 16% this year and notched 38 record closes, most recently on Friday.<br />With stock valuations sitting above long-term norms, investors will also be looking to executives for clues on what the future holds for company profits.<br />“Do people reward the markets even further from the levels that we’re seeing today?” said Amy Kong, chief investment officer at Barrett Asset Management. “It really depends I think on what management teams would say.”<br />Investors this week will parse results from big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., as well as from companies ranging from PepsiCo Inc. to  Delta Air Lines Inc.  to  UnitedHealth Group Inc."
