    "body": "As a father of three, I want to offer a sincere thank you for publishing Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo and Dr. Harvey A. Risch’s “Are Covid Vaccines Riskier Than Advertised?” (op-ed, June 23). An open and honest risk-benefit analysis is needed before we rush headlong into mass vaccinating our youth with a not-yet-fully-FDA-approved vaccine that uses new technology.<br />I am a firm believer that the benefits of the vaccines for adults are greater than the risks, even recognizing the politics and flaws in case and death counts for Covid-19. But the calculus for kids is not the same. They are not as vulnerable nor do they spread the virus like adults. Yet coercion to vaccinate our kids continues to build from politicians, schools, neighbors and even family members, in advance of a more detailed understanding of risks and benefits.<br />Robert Maxwell<br />Summit, N.J.<br />"
