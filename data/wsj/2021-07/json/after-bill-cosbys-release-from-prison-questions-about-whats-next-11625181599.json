    "body": "Bill Cosby’s release from prison following a ruling that overturned his conviction on sexual-assault charges reverberated throughout the #MeToo movement and raised questions about whether the entertainer, now 83 years old, might return to public life.<br />Mr. Cosby was nearly three years into a three-to-10-year prison sentence for the sexual assault of Andrea Constand when his conviction was overturned on Wednesday. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Cosby’s immunity agreement with a previous prosecutor meant he never should have been charged in the case. He was immediately released from prison.<br />For leaders of the #MeToo movement, which rose to prominence in 2017 following revelations about sexual misconduct by film producer Harvey Weinstein, Mr. Cosby’s release was met with concerns about whether the reversal might cause other victims of sexual assault to avoid coming forward.<br />“This is a man who is a repeat offender and predator who escaped accountability for his actions and has escaped yet again,” said Tina Tchen, president and chief executive of advocacy group Time’s Up, which grew out of the #MeToo movement and supports the victims of sexual harassment, assault and discrimination.<br />Ms. Tchen said the ruling has taken the focus off the damage Mr. Cosby is accused of having done to 60 women over his career. “The experience of those survivors should not be lost here,” she said."
