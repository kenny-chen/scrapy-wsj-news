    "body": "U.S. stock futures wavered Monday as investors geared up for corporate earnings season to kick off this week.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 slipped 0.3% after the broad-market index reached a record high on Friday. Futures linked to the Nasdaq-100 ticked up 0.1%, suggesting further gains in technology stocks after the Nasdaq Composite ended last week at a record. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down 0.5%.<br />In premarket trading, Virgin Galactic jumped over 7% after the company launched founder Richard Branson to the edge of space over the weekend. He returned to Earth safely on Sunday. The shares have doubled so far this year.<br />Chinese ride-hailing company  Didi Global  slumped nearly 5% premarket. Beijing’s moves to crack down on data policy and on overseas IPOs have battered the recently listed company’s shares.<br />Earnings season begins Tuesday and investors will be closely watching to see if companies’ results justify the high valuations in the equity market."
