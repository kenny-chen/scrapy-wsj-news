    "body": "Businesses reported prices increased at an above-average pace as the U.S. economy’s recovery further strengthened going into the summer, the Federal Reserve said in a report released Wednesday.<br />The Fed, in its latest Beige Book report that collects business anecdotes from around the country, cited business concerns about inflationary pressures lingering for a while. “While some contacts felt that pricing pressures were transitory, the majority expected further increases in input costs and selling prices in the coming months,” the report said.<br />It said supply-chain disruptions became more widespread for both labor and materials, and that businesses reported low inventories and delivery delays.<br />The Fed also said the economy overall grew at a brisk pace over the past two months. “The U.S. economy strengthened further from late May to early July, displaying moderate to robust growth,” the Fed said. The report said the improvement came as consumers spent more on tourism, travel and other services that were restricted earlier in the pandemic.<br />Employers throughout the country also saw varying job gains, with many noting difficulties in finding workers. Wages increased at a moderate pace and demand for low-skilled workers rose, suggesting workers have increased leverage in a tight labor market."
