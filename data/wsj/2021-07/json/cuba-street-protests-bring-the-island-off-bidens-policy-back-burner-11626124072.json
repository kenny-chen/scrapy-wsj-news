    "body": "WASHINGTON—Six months into office, President Biden has been slow to define his Cuba policy, making no substantial moves to ease his predecessor’s crackdown on travel and remittances, but not repudiating former President Barack Obama’s rapprochement either.<br />Now, the widespread street protests and the communist government’s violent crackdown may have forced the issue and Mr. Biden faces a challenging political landscape.<br />“It demands a presidential commitment one way or another. I don’t believe he’ll have the luxury of letting itself play out without his intervention,” said Fernand Amandi, a Miami-based Democratic pollster.<br />As protests continued Monday, Mr. Biden said: “The United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights. And we call on the government of Cuba to refrain from violence in their attempt to silence the voices of the people.” He added he would have more to say this week.<br />The president’s foreign policy agenda thus far has been consumed with countering China and Russia and re-engaging European allies. Former President Donald Trump’s gains among Cuban-American voters in Florida in 2020 have demonstrated the domestic political peril of outreach to Havana, political analysts say."
