    "body": "PHILADELPHIA—President Biden blasted efforts in Republican-controlled states to tighten voting rules and called on Congress to advance stalled legislation in a speech Tuesday, as he faces pressure from some Democrats and activists to do more to curb GOP-backed election-law changes.<br />Mr. Biden likened the efforts in some states to enact tougher election rules to Jim Crow laws that prevented Blacks from voting and labeled them as undemocratic. He also criticized Republicans who oppose Democratic-sponsored voting legislation in the Senate.<br />“Hear me clearly: There’s an unfolding assault taking place in America today—an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote and fair and free elections,” Mr. Biden said. “An assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are as Americans.”<br />“We’ve got to act,” Mr. Biden said as he ended his speech at the National Constitution Center, knocking his fist against the podium.<br />Voting issues have become a top priority in both parties this year. Republicans say the changes they have pushed in states such as Georgia and Texas, which include new limits on mail ballots and more identification requirements for voters requesting a mail ballot, are aimed at improving election security. They also say the federal government shouldn’t interfere with voting rules set by states."
