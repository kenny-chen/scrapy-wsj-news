    "body": "Regarding “Huge Winter Gas Bills Spark Anger, Action” (U.S. News, June 28): Renewables subsidies, goals and mandates have undercut reliable baseload power generation (primarily from hydrocarbons) and distorted the market. Consumers are overreliant on intermittent power-generation sources such as wind that sometimes aren’t there when we need them most. Meanwhile, most natural gas is sold based on monthly average price contracts, not spot price. Natural-gas producers saved tens of thousands of lives this winter, but they didn’t set prices or reap windfalls. Like farmers and ranchers, they take the price set by regional and global markets. The market signals were a vast and lengthy wind drought plus extreme demand for home heating and natural-gas power generation. The culprits behind this winter’s utility-bill price spike are supply and demand, a generational weather event and policy overreach in the name of climate virtue at consumers’ behest.<br />Brook A.
