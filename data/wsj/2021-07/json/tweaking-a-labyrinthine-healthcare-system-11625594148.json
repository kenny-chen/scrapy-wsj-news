    "body": "Bobby Jindal has good ideas for how “Republicans Can Lead on Healthcare Reform” (op-ed, June 25). But without congressional action on decades of misguided legislation and regulatory provisions that control the structure of the system, nothing will be accomplished. For instance, discussion about addressing “overconsolidation among hospitals” is fruitless without paying attention to the provisions under ObamaCare that have put this consolidation in overdrive. ObamaCare is far more encompassing than the insurance provisions that are the typical focus of attention. It is the job of Congress to provide benefits, but Congress needs to leave it up to industry to innovate and compete to deliver the services.<br />Brook Chambery<br />Rochester, N.Y.<br /><br />The price transparency for which Mr. Jindal argues already exists—for insurance companies. Insurers have negotiated prices for hospital and other medical services that are significantly lower than providers’ list prices. At present the consumer can get the benefit of the insurers’ bargaining power only by purchase of an insurance policy. But this connection is not economically necessary."
