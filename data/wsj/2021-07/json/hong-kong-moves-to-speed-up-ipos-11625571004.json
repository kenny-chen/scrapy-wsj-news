    "body": "Hong Kong’s stock exchange is moving to speed up initial public offerings, overhauling a system where investors must wait at least a week for a newly priced stock to start trading.<br />The long time lag relative to the U.S. markets—where stocks typically begin changing hands a day after an IPO is priced—increases the risk of market sentiment souring due to external events.<br />The plans were put forward Tuesday by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd., the operator of the city’s stock market, following a consultation. They are due to take effect in the fourth quarter of 2022, and aim to help Hong Kong stay competitive as a listing venue.<br />The Asian financial hub has enjoyed a boom in stock issuance, thanks in part to a flurry of big Chinese IPOs and a string of secondary listings by tech companies from China whose stocks already trade in the U.S.<br />Including these secondary deals, Hong Kong hosted a record $28 billion of IPOs in the first half of this year, according to Refinitiv data, making it the third-largest listing venue after the  Nasdaq Stock Market  and the New York Stock Exchange."
