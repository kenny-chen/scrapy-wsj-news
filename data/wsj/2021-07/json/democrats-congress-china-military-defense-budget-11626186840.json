    "body": "“Does the Pentagon Take China Seriously?” Not seriously enough, writes Rep. Elaine Luria (op-ed, July 6). But she doesn’t mention a party that deserves even greater blame for our military’s unpreparedness: The Democratic majority in Congress.<br />Congress controls the defense budget, which is set to grow at a slower pace than inflation. This constraint, which forces the military to make hard choices, was not imposed out of fiscal responsibility. The Biden administration’s nondefense wish list includes around $6 trillion in new spending.<br />The misallocation of resources can be stopped. With a few of her fellow Democrats, Rep. Luria has the power to bring the Biden administration’s priorities to a standstill until there is an agreement to get the military the resources it needs.<br />China’s navy now has more ships than ours, its missile technology is superior and its words and actions have become increasingly bellicose. Failing to address our military shortcomings will undermine our ability to deter China and thus make Chinese aggression more likely. America is sleepwalking into a disaster. Congress must wake up and act.<br />Nicholas Joy"
