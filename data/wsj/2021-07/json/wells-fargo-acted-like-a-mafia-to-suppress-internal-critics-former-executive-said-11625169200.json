    "body": "A former top  Wells Fargo  & Co. executive in London said the lender had a flawed compliance culture and executives acted like a mafia to suppress internal critics, according to a recorded phone call submitted to a U.K. court.<br />Alicia Reyes was chief executive of Wells Fargo’s European investment bank. She left the bank in January 2020 and criticized the lender in an April 2020 telephone call with a former Wells Fargo contract worker who is suing for unfair dismissal after he raised concerns internally about compliance failings in the U.K.<br />“It’s like a mafia, literally,” Ms. Reyes said during the call. “This place is just a scheme. There’s no intention of actually solving problems or building things. There’s just smoke and mirrors and a coverup.”<br />“The pile of regulatory problems that they have is so large,” Ms. Reyes continued. “There are much bigger issues that they are also sweeping under the carpet.”<br />Ms. Reyes declined to comment."
