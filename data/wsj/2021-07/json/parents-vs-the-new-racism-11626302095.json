    "body": "Here’s a sign of the progressive times. On Friday federal judge William Young withdrew an earlier opinion approving a temporary new admissions plan for three elite Boston public schools. The new plan substitutes grades and zip codes for a competitive entrance exam, which appears designed to reduce the number of white and Asian-American students.<br />Judge Young said he took this extraordinary step—the first in his 36-year judicial career—because the school system’s attorneys had misled him by excluding from the court racially charged text messages sent by two Boston School Committee members involved in the admissions decision.<br />The texts were sent during the virtual meeting when the admissions changes were approved, and they suggest there was racial animus behind the decision. Committee member Lorna Rivera, for example, sent a message to fellow member Alexandra Oliver-Dávila saying she was “sick of westie whites.”<br />“Me too,” Ms. Oliver-Dávila replied. “I really feel like saying that.” Committee chairman Michael Loconto mocked the Asian names of some of those who commented.<br />All three have since resigned, and the Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence is hoping the judge will formally reopen the case. Though Judge Young makes clear he may not change his ultimate conclusion, he has also suggested that withholding these texts from the court record is “potentially fraud on the Court.”"
