    "body": "Peggy Noonan is pleased that “New York Democrats Take a Stab at Reality” (Declarations, June 26) in their primary election for New York City mayor. Her assessment that voters realize they are amid a crime wave and cannot afford to ignore law and order is based on the fact that the three “more or less reality-oriented moderates” in the election received 63% of the first-choice vote.<br />Applauding New Yorkers for favoring the slightly less-progressive and less-hostile-to-police candidates in a city plagued by crime is a stretch.

Ms. Noonan included a third candidate, Kathryn Garcia (19%), in her list of moderates, even though her primary crime-control fixes are gun suppression, gun buybacks and zero tolerance for police behavior that is anything but perfect.
