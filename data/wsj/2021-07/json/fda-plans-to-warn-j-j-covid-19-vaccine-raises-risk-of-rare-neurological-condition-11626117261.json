    "body": "U.S. health regulators are expected to warn that the  Johnson & Johnson  Covid-19 vaccine is linked to a very small incidence of cases of a rare neurological disorder associated with other shots.<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to add the warning language to the J&J shot’s label, after finding a handful of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome among the millions of people who have gotten the vaccine, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare neurological disorder in which the immune system attacks nerves, causing temporary but potentially severe paralysis. The risk is a known one with vaccines, including some influenza vaccines and a leading shot to prevent shingles.<br />Johnson & Johnson said Monday it has been in discussions with the FDA and other regulators about reports of Guillain-Barré following vaccination with its single dose coronavirus vaccine.<br />The company said that while the chance of such cases is very low, it exceeds the rate of normally reported cases among the general population by a small degree. The shot is a valuable tool in the fight against the pandemic, the company said."
