    "body": "Life can be a beach with painterly prints and shimmering silhouettes that shout “out of office.” Dutch catwalk star Jill Kortleve wears summery styles with a lighthearted playfulness in the enchanting fishing village of Nervi, just northwest of Portofino, Italy. Brilliant hues and body-skimming fabrics, as seen in dresses from Missoni and Stella McCartney, are easy options for hot, sunny days. Chanel and Tory Burch offer swimsuits with exuberant graphics that will make a splash. Sequined dresses from  Burberry ,  Celine by Hedi Slimane and Michael Kors sparkle as brightly as the waters of the Mediterranean Sea.<br />Hemlines rise higher than the tides with a sequined minidress from Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello while embroidered crystals adorn Dolce & Gabbana’s jersey pieces. A Balenciaga nylon tulip-printed raincoat is a charming way to protect from summer rains, while a black vinyl Versace jacket provides sleek coverage. Keep vacation accessories simple yet chic, with leather platform sandals from Alaïa that easily go from day to night and silver Hermès jewelry that will add polish to any look. —Kevin Huynh<br /><br />"
