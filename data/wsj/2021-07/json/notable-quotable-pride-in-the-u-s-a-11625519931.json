As the nation celebrates its 245th birthday, the first in a series of I&I/TIPP polls finds that 68% of adults say they are “very” or “extremely” proud to be an American, with another 15% “moderately” proud. . . .<br />Even among blacks and Hispanics, who are repeatedly described as victims of embedded American racism and intolerance, pride is strong. The poll found that 55% of blacks and 57% of Hispanics say they are either extremely or very proud to be Americans. Just 7% of blacks and 9% of Hispanics say they aren’t proud at all of their nationality.<br />So, which is the one—and only one—demographic group in the I&I/TIPP poll that is not proud to be American?"
