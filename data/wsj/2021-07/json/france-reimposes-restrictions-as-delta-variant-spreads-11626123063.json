    "body": "PARIS—Only people who are vaccinated or recently tested negative for Covid-19 will be allowed in bars, restaurants and malls in France starting from August, President Emmanuel Macron said Monday, as the spread of the virus increases across the country.<br />The new restrictions will also apply in trains, domestic flights, theaters, amusement parks, concert halls, hospitals and nursing homes. Authorities will reinforce border controls this week and impose quarantines on travelers who aren’t vaccinated and have arrived from countries at risk, he added.<br />The measures could have a negative impact on tourism in France, one of the world’s top tourist destinations, just as the number of foreign visitors has started to pick up.<br />The rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant is forcing authorities across Europe to reimpose health measures to stop it. The Netherlands on Friday announced restrictions on nightclubs and music festivals in response to a pickup in cases, after relaxing them only weeks earlier. In France, a national lockdown and a massive vaccination campaign helped slow the spread of the virus this spring.<br />But the Delta variant is now threatening to undo the recent progress in beating back the virus. After falling from more than 42,000 in mid-April to less than 2,000 in late June, the seven-day average of new daily cases has started to increase again in recent days, standing at nearly 4,000 on Sunday."
