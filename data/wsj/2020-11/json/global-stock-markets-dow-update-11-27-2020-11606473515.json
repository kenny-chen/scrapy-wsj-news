    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged up Friday, signaling that markets will end the week on an upbeat note with major indexes near all-time highs.<br />Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.2% ahead of a short trading session, with markets scheduled to close at 1 p.m. ET. The blue-chips index earlier this week breached the 30000 milestone for the first time in its history, before sliding lower Wednesday. Trading was suspended Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.<br />Contracts linked to the S&P 500 ticked 0.2% higher, suggesting that the broad-market gauge may erase its tepid loss from Wednesday. The index had climbed to a record Tuesday.<br />Major technology stocks, in particular, are poised to extend a rally that sent the Nasdaq Composite to its 44th record closing level of 2020 on Wednesday. Futures linked to the Nasdaq-100 index advanced 0.4% Friday.<br />Markets have been buoyant this week despite rising coronavirus infection levels across the U.S. and economic data pointing to a halting recovery that may curb consumer confidence. Investors appear to be looking ahead to next year, betting that Covid-19 vaccines will curb the pandemic and allow social and business activity to return to normal."
