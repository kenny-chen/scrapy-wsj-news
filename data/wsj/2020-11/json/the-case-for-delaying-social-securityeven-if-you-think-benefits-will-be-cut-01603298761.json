Pre-pandemic estimates put the trust fund going to empty around 2034, but given everything going on with our economy that estimate seems a tad optimistic.<br />When the trust fund goes to zero, though, it doesn’t mean benefits go to zero. At that point benefits would be based on taxes collected. Assuming nothing changes policy wise, that would reduce benefits to approximately 76% of what they are now.<br />While I think it is unlikely individuals currently receiving Social Security retirement benefits would experience a cut, the potential impact of a benefit reduction for others does raise a question: Should I get the most out of my benefits while I can?<br />So, does a potential shortfall make the argument for claiming benefits as early as you can starting at age 62? I recently did some math and ran an analysis to determine how different benefit reductions, expected retirement durations, and portfolio returns affect the optimal claiming decision."
