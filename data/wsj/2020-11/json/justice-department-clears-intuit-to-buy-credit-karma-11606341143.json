    "body": "The Justice Department cleared Credit Karma Inc.’s pending $7.1 billion sale to TurboTax maker  Intuit Inc.  after the two companies agreed to divest Credit Karma’s burgeoning tax-preparation business to satisfy antitrust concerns.<br />Under a proposed settlement filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, Credit Karma and Intuit said they would sell Credit Karma Tax to  Square Inc.,  the financial-technology company run by Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Square was in talks to acquire the tax-prep business.<br />Square said it would pay $50 million in cash for Credit Karma Tax, which entered the market in 2017 and helped more than two million individuals file their 2020 taxes. Around 41 million people used Intuit’s TurboTax to file their 2020 taxes.<br />The Justice Department argued that Credit Karma’s small but growing tax-prep business, which charges no fees, provided a check on Intuit’s ability to increase the prices it charges for paid versions of TurboTax and degrade the quality of free versions.<br />Allowing the two companies to move forward with the original deal would “further cement TurboTax’s dominance,” the department said in court papers."
