    "body": "WASHINGTON—Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to be Treasury secretary, will confront an economic recovery that appears to be losing momentum and uncertain prospects for additional stimulus from Congress.<br />If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Yellen would play a key role pushing for more aid for an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic and related shutdowns, especially if Congress is unable to reach an agreement on a relief package before Mr. Biden takes office on Jan. 20.<br />The rebound that began over the summer is showing signs of faltering as new virus cases surge and job growth slows, and much of the aid lawmakers passed earlier this year has run out. JPMorgan Chase & Co. economists said last week they expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter of 2021.<br />Ms. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, will have to forge broad consensus on economic policy and sell ideas within the administration, on Capitol Hill and among the general public, said Tony Fratto, a Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration.<br />“Right now, we live in a country where people look at the same set of facts and come to diametrically opposite conclusions, so that is a big challenge for anybody who takes that job, to build support for your policy outcomes,” he said."
