    "body": "In June, the U.S. Department of Labor proposed a regulation to change the rules governing advice in retirement accounts to align with another Trump administration standard. But delays in completing the proposal, likely due in part to financial-industry opposition, have left it vulnerable to being scrapped after President-elect Joe Biden takes office.<br />“Time is quickly running out” on the proposed rule, said Jason Berkowitz, chief legal and regulatory affairs officer at the Insured Retirement Institute, a trade association for the annuities industry, which was critical of some proposed provisions.<br />The Labor Department declined to comment.<br />Such an outcome would mark the latest development in a decadeslong debate over what responsibilities brokers and other advisers have to clients when giving investment advice in 401(k)-type accounts and individual retirement accounts and how to manage conflicts of interest in the sale of investments in those accounts.<br />Tuesday, the Labor Department submitted the proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review, a step toward finalizing the regulation."
