As of late August, Ascena operated 1,500 stores throughout the U.S.<br />The company has already sold its Justice and Catherines brands out of bankruptcy as online-only businesses.<br />Permanent closures of retail stores in the country hit a record in the first half of 2020 as pandemic lockdowns and shoppers’ fear of disease curbed foot traffic, pushing Ascena and dozens of other retailers into bankruptcy."
