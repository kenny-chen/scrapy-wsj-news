    "body": "The U.S. government isn’t liable for losses on $3 billion in Puerto Rico pension bonds, a federal judge said Monday, rejecting efforts to put U.S. taxpayers on the hook for compensating investors.<br />Judge Richard A. Hertling of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims said bondholders can’t hold the U.S. government responsible for losses they may incur in the court-supervised restructuring of Puerto Rico’s debts. A federally appointed oversight board has been steering that restructuring since 2016, part of a broader push to rehabilitate the U.S. territory’s public finances.<br />The board has proposed deep write-downs on the pension bonds, sold in 2008 to prop up Puerto Rico’s failing public pension system. They are a relatively small slice of the roughly $125 billion pile of bonds and pension obligations that drove Puerto Rico to file the largest-ever municipal bankruptcy in 2017.<br />Judge Hertling’s ruling dismissed a lawsuit filed by Oaktree Capital Management LP and other bondholders accusing the U.S. government of illegally taking their property.<br />Oaktree declined to comment. Representatives for other bondholders didn’t respond to a request for comment."
