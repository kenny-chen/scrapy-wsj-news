    "body": "<br />Deutsche Bank AG  executives want to expand in Russia despite a legacy of missteps and massive fines. Outside monitors who watch over the bank’s money-laundering controls said it should shut the business instead, according to a person familiar with the communications.<br />The monitors, appointed by New York state’s Department of Financial Services, told the bank in October that efforts to improve its operation weren’t enough to make up for the large risks of doing business with Russian clients, the person said.<br />A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment on its dialogue with monitors, but said it is conducting a risk analysis for several countries, including Russia. “As we work to continuously improve our controls in combating financial crime, our risk appetite must be in line with the maturity of those controls,” he added.<br />A Department of Financial Services spokeswoman declined to comment."
