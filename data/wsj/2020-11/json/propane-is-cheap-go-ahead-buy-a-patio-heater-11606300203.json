    "body": "The coronavirus pandemic has made propane a hot commodity among Americans heating outdoor spaces and hunkering down in Covid cabins. Fortunately for them, the country is flooded with the fuel, and prices have rarely been lower heading into winter.<br />Spot-market propane prices at the Mont Belvieu, Texas, trading hub have more than doubled since dropping in late March to their lowest level in more than a quarter-century. But at 55 cents a gallon, they are still about one-third lower than the 10-year average for November.<br />Residential prices, which are cheaper in the middle of the country and more expensive in East Coast markets such as Florida and New England, have lately averaged $1.85 a gallon, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. That is the lowest for this time of year in more than a decade.<br />It isn’t as though there is no demand for propane, which belongs with butane and ethane to a class of hydrocarbons called natural-gas liquids, or NGLs.<br />The U.S. is exporting about four times as much propane as it shipped abroad in 2013, when the country became the world’s top propane exporter. At home, an uptick in residential demand has helped to offset lower use by businesses and farmers, who haven’t needed grain-drying equipment much this year because a lack of rain allowed them to let crops dry in the field."
