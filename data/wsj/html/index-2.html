      <td>German conglomerate strikes agreement with plaintiffs’ attorneys for a $2 billion compensation program for future claims</td>
      <td>Bayer AG  is trying again to contain its liability over claims that its popular Roundup weedkiller causes cancer, unveiling Wednesday a $2 billion proposal to pay farmers and gardeners who try to blame the company for illnesses in the future.<br />The German company and plaintiffs’ lawyers said they would seek a U.S. District Court judge’s permission for a compensation program that would pay between around $5,000 and $200,000 each to future plaintiffs who contract non-Hodgkin lymphoma after using Roundup.<br />Bayer has been battling litigation over Roundup’s safety since acquiring Monsanto Co., the weedkiller’s manufacturer, in 2018. After three California juries found in favor of sick plaintiffs, Bayer agreed last June to pay up to $9.6 billion to settle existing Roundup cases. It continues to deny any link between the product and cancer.<br />That deal, however, didn’t prevent more plaintiffs from coming forward in the future. An earlier proposal to create a panel of scientific experts whose conclusions on Roundup’s safety would bind future litigants didn’t pass muster with a federal judge, and Bayer has been working with plaintiffs’ lawyers since July on a revision.<br />The new proposed class action covers those who haven’t yet hired a lawyer to pursue a Roundup claim. If approved by the court, individuals who believe Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin lymphoma can apply for a settlement from a $1.33 billion pot of money, with the offers dependent on age, health, proof of Roundup use and other factors. Those who opt out can still pursue litigation on their own, with the prospect of convincing a jury to award higher, punitive damages not available to class members. The settlement fund will last four years, with the option to extend it after that.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Joe Manchin said he would support the nearly $2 trillion price tag for President Biden’s coronavirus-relief package. Now Democrats will just have to keep him on board.<br />“If it’s $1.9 trillion, so be it,” Mr. Manchin said on MSNBC. “If it’s a little smaller than that and we find a targeted need, then that’s what we’re going to do.”<br />The comments from the centrist Democrat from West Virginia provided a boost to party leaders as they pursue passing a relief bill without Republican votes. But they also underscored the power that a 50-50 Senate grants individual senators. Mr. Manchin is still seeking more-targeted aid payments and a smaller increase in the federal minimum wage than what Mr. Biden proposed.<br />Mr. Manchin said he is still talking with Republicans, and that he wanted the process to be bipartisan, including giving both parties the chance to amend the legislation.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday that there will be an “open, bipartisan amendment process” as the chamber debates Democrats’ budget resolution over the next two days. He invited Republicans to participate. But he reiterated his party is committed to passing a big rescue package quickly.</td>

      <td>If you’re one of the millions of people who have worked from outside your home state this year, tax season could be tough: You might need to file returns and pay taxes to more than one state for 2020.<br />The challenge is that each state’s tax system is a unique mix of rules, and they are even more confusing this year because of pandemic-related changes. Here’s what to know.<br />Potentially yes, but it depends on the states.<br />A few states don’t have income taxes, but nearly all that do impose them on workers who are just passing through. Many of these states—including New York and California, which are famously aggressive—are still set to levy taxes on remote workers for 2020.<br />However, not all remote workers will face new cross-border burdens. About 15 jurisdictions, such as Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, have long had agreements with neighbors allowing commuters to file and pay taxes where they live.</td>

He was rarely seen on Broadway, and on the big screen he generally appeared in choice but small character roles, most memorably in Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln,” in which he played a shrewd presidential adviser, and “All the President’s Men,” in which he was Deep Throat.<br />Yet Mr. Holbrook is remembered to this day for his two greatest stage roles, both of which he also had the uncommon good luck to perform in very fine TV versions that remain in circulation.

      <td>Supreme Court rules that regulatory changes in the country’s electricity market that give priority to the state-owned utility over private power generators is unconstitutional</td>
      <td>Mexico’s Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that changes in regulations for the country’s electricity market giving priority to the state-owned utility over private power generators is unconstitutional.<br />The ruling is a setback for President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s plans to restore the dominance of state-owned energy companies, and bodes badly for a bill he sent to congress this week that would give the state-owned utility CFE a commanding position in the power market.<br />It also could set up a confrontation between the court and the president, a nationalist who seeks to reverse key parts of a historic energy-sector overhaul carried out under his predecessor that ended Mexico’s state monopoly on the oil market and opened electricity markets to greater private investment.<br />Mexican courts are emerging as an obstacle to Mr. Lopez Obrador’s drive to centralize power, say analysts. A number of lower court decisions have gone against the government in the energy sector, and the Supreme Court had stopped the government from lowering the salaries of senior officials at autonomous institutions such as the central bank.<br />Wednesday’s ruling by a 4-1 vote knocks down key aspects of a policy published last year by the Energy Ministry that required the national power grid operator to take electricity generated by CFE before cheaper options from private generators that have invested billions of dollars in the country, especially in wind and solar stations. The ministry argued that the change was necessary to ensure network reliability.</td>

Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos were more harshly treated.<br />In our filing with Judge Boasberg, we pointed out how attorney Alex van der Zwaan, the first person sentenced in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, also pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement. Like Mr. Clinesmith, he asked for probation as a first offender and because his wife, too, was pregnant with their first child. Judge Amy Berman Jackson would hear none of it. In imposing a 30-day sentence, she said some prison time was necessary for both punishment and deterrent purposes: “It’s a message that needs to be sent, especially given the fact that you’re an attorney.”<br />Mr. Clinesmith wasn’t just an attorney, but one who held a public trust as an FBI attorney responsible for providing intelligence information to the FISA court that Judge Boasberg heads.

On the other hand, today’s economists—technocrats on the left with grand agendas—seek data of commensurate size. Big data enables big government; bigger data feeds bigger government and the more government grows, the more our liberty contracts.

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats said they would hold a vote Thursday to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.) from her committees over her past incendiary remarks and social-media posts, ratcheting up pressure on House Republicans wrestling with whether to take disciplinary action.<br />The intensifying fight over the freshman lawmaker converged Wednesday with an effort to topple House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming after she voted to impeach former President Donald Trump. The two developments, set to be discussed at a House GOP meeting in the afternoon, highlighted the fierce infighting roiling the Republican Party as it seeks to define itself after Mr. Trump’s loss.<br />After weeks of withholding judgment, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) will be forced to make a decision Wednesday on whether to strip committee assignments from Mrs. Greene, a Trump loyalist who has been condemned on both sides of the aisle for embracing conspiracy theories. Democrats said the House will vote Thursday to remove her from the committees if Mr. McCarthy doesn’t act first.<br />At the same time, he will also referee an effort from some lawmakers to demote Ms. Cheney, the only member of GOP leadership to vote to impeach Mr. Trump last month on allegations that he incited the violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />Mr. McCarthy ascended to power on his ability to forge strong relationships, including with Mr. Trump. His decisions Wednesday will almost certainly leave some faction of the House GOP unhappy and complicate his ambitions of becoming speaker if the GOP reclaims the House next year.</td>

      <td>Marble? Corian? Quartzite? We consulted interior designers to match countertop substances with personality types. Find yourself, and your next kitchen here.</td>
      <td>WE ASK A LOT of our kitchen countertops. We gather around them, work at them, prep food on them, eat on them—and these days we also seem to think our counters should say something about us. So, given the kaleidoscopic array of options on the market, how do you know which material suits you? In kitchen design as in all relationships it comes down to compatibility. Pride yourself on hard-nosed practicality? You’ll likely love clean, indestructible quartzite. Millennial fashionista? Terrazzo beckons. We asked a few of our favorite design experts to play matchmaker with a varied lineup of countertop materials, personalities and budgets. Here’s what shook out.<br />Want to avoid the hefty install costs that come with materials like marble? Tile countertops (from $10 a square foot) can be a smart workaround, said Beth Dotolo of Seattle-based Pulp Design Studios. But beware: Grout gets grimy fast. For a refined, durable look, opt for large-format tile that’s been rectified to avoid large grout lines. Houston designer Marie Flanigan, who just completed an island using 12-inch-by-24-inch reclaimed limestone tiles, concurred. “People think of those clunky 4-inch squares we grew up with,” she said, “but if you choose wisely, tile can get you the beauty of natural stone without the price tag of a slab.”<br />For a sleek, midcentury look, stainless steel countertops (from $55 a square foot) are New York kitchen-cabinetry designer Christopher Peacock’s choice. They require custom fabrication, so they’re not a budget option—but besides Machine Age good looks, they have a lot to recommend them. They’re germ-resistant, easy to clean and impervious to stains and rust.<br />When it’s perfectly seamless simplicity you’re after, man-made, “solid surface” workhorses like Corian (from $40 a square foot) are hard to beat, said Marianne Brown of Salt Lake City’s W Design Collective. “If I’m using Corian, I always stick to solid colors and straight lines, because decorative edges can definitely make it look dated,” she added. Another nifty trick? Match the color of your countertop to your cabinets for a sleek monochromatic effect.<br />Do even the tiniest blemishes make you hyperventilate? Quartzite counters (from $50 to over $200 a square foot) could be the answer. Slabs of it come in a range of hues, from brown to blue to bright white, and include all kinds of movement veining. “Quartzite is the most durable natural stone, harder than granite, so we use it all the time when a client needs something heat- and scratch-resistant and nearly indestructible,” said Ms. Flanigan.”</td>

Officials added Canada is believed to be the first jurisdiction to list the Proud Boys as a terrorist group.<br />“There is a growing body of evidence, collected here in Canada but also [by the U.S.], of an escalation of violence that the Proud Boys has been involved in,” said Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.<br />“This is not about politics,” he added, “and it is not about infringing upon the freedom of belief, association or speech. It is about controlling violent activities of ideologically-motivated extremism.”<br />Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, said the decision was unjustified and demonstrated heavy-handedness from Canada’s Liberal government.</td>

      <td>Studios have until the end of February to release films for Oscars consideration. And because of the pandemic, many of the new titles can be viewed at home.</td>
      <td>On the movie calendar pretzeled by the pandemic, February is the new December—the last month for movies to qualify for the Academy Awards. With the Oscars telecast pushed to its latest date ever (April 25), a normally sleepy month for new releases brings a cluster of films trying to slingshot into the big game.<br />Some of them are already in the running for other awards, including “Nomadland,” “The Father” and “Judas and the Black Messiah,” all nominated Wednesday for Golden Globe Awards. (That ceremony is scheduled for Feb. 28, more than a month later than usual.)<br />The February blitz has repercussions for everyday film fans, too. Instead of the typical incremental release starting “in select theaters,” most awards contenders are also dropping in living rooms around the same time for on-demand viewing. The hard part is keeping track of all the variations of when, where and how to see them.<br />Even for Hollywood, it’s been a challenge to monitor a playing field reshaped by theater closures and awards organizations responding to Covid.<br />“It’s been a long run of the award-type films, starting in late summer through now. From that standpoint, it sure feels like we’re still in 2020,” says Pam Williams, a producer of “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” about the feds’ targeting of the jazz legend, played by Andra Day. Director Lee Daniels made it for the big screen, shooting it on film in 2019. But the plan for a theatrical release through Paramount Pictures changed when Hulu bought the film for an exclusive U.S. release.</td>

      <td>The irony of Google shining more light on its cloud business is that the move proved just how much the internet giant still needs its advertising machine.<br />And what a machine it is. Parent company  Alphabet  Inc.’s  fourth-quarter results late Tuesday showed that advertising revenue surged 22% year over year to a record $46.2 billion. That was 9% higher than the already strong advertising recovery Wall Street had been expecting following an unprecedented dip in the first half of 2020, which was caused by the pandemic’s damage to major industries such as travel that are big Google ad buyers. The company said Tuesday that the recovery was fueled both by brand and direct-response advertising; YouTube advertising alone surged 46% year over year to about $6.9 billion.<br />Advertising turned out to be the bright light in a quarter that also included the company’s first disclosure of its cloud profits, or rather the lack thereof. Google Cloud grew 46% last year by generating nearly $13.1 billion in revenue. But it also lost $5.6 billion, and has run operating losses for the past three years. That may have been in line with previous signals from the company about the scale of its investment in the business, but it still took many by surprise. Michael Levine of Pivotal Research called the losses “fairly shocking” in a note to clients.  Amazon.com ’s  AWS division was generating about $3.4 billion a year in operating profit when at a similar revenue level.<br />But investors quickly got over the sticker shock. Alphabet’s stock price surged nearly 9% by Wednesday afternoon to a record. As it turns out, the company’s decision to break out Google Cloud as its own segment showcased just how strong its ad business is. Under the new reporting structure, the segment called Google Services that includes advertising showed an operating margin of 32% for 2020. That is 7 percentage points higher than the operating margin reported for the core Google business in 2019 when that core segment included both advertising and the cloud operations.<br />Analysts largely gave Google a pass on the steep cloud losses, projecting that the business will eventually scale to a healthy bottom line. The company itself noted that its backlog for the cloud business jumped to $30 billion by the end of the quarter compared with $19 billion just three months prior. And despite its reputation for big spending, Alphabet’s capital expenditures have actually declined for two years in a row now, leading to record free cash flow of $42.8 billion in 2020. Google may be playing an expensive game of catch-up in the cloud, but it at least has the means to run the race.</td>

      <td>Trimming hair at home—be it yours, your partner’s or your squirming child’s—can easily result in disaster. Here, expert advice on how to masterfully shear the whole family.</td>
      <td>THE SKILL that matters most when you’re attempting to cut your hair at home is not point-cutting—i.e., chipping into ends with the tip of the scissors while holding them vertically to create texture. It’s not beveling—i.e., rounding out the angles of a razor cut.<br />It’s restraint. When cuts go awry, it’s usually because people can’t resist trimming just a bit more or refuse to leave the hard-to-reach back of their heads alone, said Ana Costa, a hairstylist at Papillon Jaune Salon in Providence, R.I. But the odds of creating non-cringe-y results vastly increase if you equip yourself with the right tools: that is, ones you’re actually qualified to use. “Don’t buy anything that requires a license,” said Ms. Costa. Basic shearing scissors, a comb and clips will do. Don’t overcomplicate things, either. Work in sections, which is tedious but effective, and set realistic expectations (Vidal Sassoon didn’t master the bob before breakfast). Here, the best techniques to try on yourself, kids and partners for cuts that look sharp from all angles.<br />On yourself: Start with dry or damp hair so you have an accurate sense of the length and don’t inadvertently change the geometry of your cut. Just clean up the lines. If you have bangs, start by trimming them: Gather the bangs and twist them into a section above your nose. Snip into the ends, first straight across and then vertically to achieve soft edges. Don’t cut bangs beyond the outer edges of your eyebrows, said Ms. Costa. To banish split ends around your face, run your comb (Ms. Costa prefers Krest’s fine-tooth models, from $6, amazon.com) through your hair, stopping ½ inch from the bottom, and snip the frayed bits. If you insist on trimming the back of your mane solo, it’s possible, but only if your hair is longer than shoulder length. Part it in the middle and pull the sections forward so the tips lie flat on your chest. Point-cut up into the ends—this results in a symmetrical V-shape, said Amy Abramite, a hairstylist at Maxine Salon in Chicago.<br />On someone else:Arm yourself with sectioning clips (Ms. Costa’s favorites are Framar Gator Grip Clips, $9 for four, framar.com) so you clearly see the areas you need to cut (front, back, sides). Good lighting also helps, so sit your “client” near a window. Starting at the nape and moving forward, release a one-inch section and trim it to the desired length—this initial cut will serve as a guide to measure all others against. “I’d advise taking off no more than ½ inch at first,” said Ms. Costa. “You can always do more later.” To avoid a (literal) square haircut, snip the ends around the face on a slight angle, holding your comb at 45-degrees and cutting along it as a guide. To avoid conjuring a Picasso, pull pieces under the chin to ensure they’re even lengths. Adjust as needed.<br />On yourself: Grab a pair of scissors and a modest clipper: “Using scissors longer than 5 1/2 inches is like cutting hair with a sword,” said Ms. Abramite. For a simple, neatly shorn cut, start buzzing with the standard number-four guard, staying below the occipital bone (where your head starts to curve). Tackle the top section with scissors: Pull small, ½-inch sections between your pointer and middle fingers and slide the hair straight up, then notch into the ends with your scissors pointed down to remove bulk. Lastly, take off the guard and buzz carefully around the perimeter of your head and neck to tidy up any scruffy strands.</td>

      <td>California Gov. Gavin Newsom has proven unwilling to live by the Covid distancing rules he imposes on voters. Now voters may be unwilling to allow the first-term Democrat to continue as California’s governor. A new survey in the Golden State suggests that his November party in defiance of pandemic protocols at the acclaimed French Laundry restaurant was even more expensive than it seemed.<br />The elections of 2020 clarified that no one should expect political polls to express mathematical precision. But the recent trend is striking. The University of California, Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies reports:<br />Inconsistent, confusing and ineffective might also describe some other Newsom policies as he has sought to define the leftward edge of state governance. But now criticism of the governor isn’t just coming from people who prefer free markets. “Gavin Newsom Is Blowing It” reads a headline today in the leftist New Republic, which describes the surprisingly strong movement to recall Newsom from office. James Pogue writes:<br />Covid lockdowns have been brutal for those Californians who can’t afford to dine at a celebrated Napa eatery. The state’s unemployment rate is now more than two full percentage points higher than the national average.<br />The Berkeley poll doesn’t find that the reliably Democratic state is quite ready to fire Mr. Newsom.

Andrew Cuomo and leaders of the state Assembly and Senate, the exchanges said any tax would prompt the relocation of securities industry firms and jobs out of New York and would also be passed along to investors and public pension funds. The letter’s 27 signatories include  Nasdaq Inc.,  the New York Stock Exchange, groups representing downstate businesses and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or Simfa, which represents financial firms.<br />“Such a tax would damage New York’s position as a global financial capital, resulting in shrinkage of an industry that is the largest contributor to our economy and tax base,” the letter says.<br />Sifma President and CEO Kenneth Bentsen Jr. said in an interview that the groups sent the letter because a number of new legislators, including Democrats who support a transaction tax, have recently taken office.<br />Rebecca Bailin, director of the pro-tax Invest in Our New York campaign, said the letter showed Wall Street firms were on the defensive and said threats to move were empty. State Assemblyman Phil Steck, an Albany-area Democrat who supports a stock-transfer tax, said any impact on individual investors would be minuscule compared with the positive effects of additional state spending on infrastructure.</td>

      <td>Like today, policy makers of the 1960s had bigger worries than prices. Then a spike crushed the economy.</td>
      <td>There is a long history of high budget deficits being associated with inflation, and Washington’s current profligate spending and the Federal Reserve’s expansive monetary policy may be pushing the U.S. down that path. In the U.S. and world-wide, the link between deficits and inflation has been most apparent during wartime, as the fiscal burdens of combat spur central banks into inflationary financing. But there are also peacetime instances. Now, after a decade of modest inflation that has made many expect it will always stay low, a rise in inflation may come as a surprise.<br />Sounding the alarm about inflation is out of vogue. Skeptics point out that high deficit spending, zero interest rates and unprecedented quantitative easing didn’t spur inflation in the decade after the 2008-09 financial crisis. That experience has left a strong impression on makers of monetary and fiscal policy.<br />But the government response to the pandemic is dwarfing the actions that followed the financial crisis. Fiscal initiatives since last March have already authorized deficit spending equal to 17% of gross domestic product. Generous government transfers to individuals and businesses have supported household incomes and will stimulate aggregate demand for years to come. President Biden now proposes additional deficit spending equal to roughly 9% of GDP. These total deficit increases are magnitudes larger than President Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.<br />Combined with the Fed’s expansive monetary policy, the government’s income supports have generated a surge in money supply and excess household savings. Even before the latest Treasury distribution of $600 checks, much less the new round of checks Mr. Biden proposes, personal savings were an estimated $1.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels. That contrasts sharply with the Fed’s post-financial-crisis quantitative-easing programs, which only generated excess reserves that sloshed around between big banks and the Fed and were never put directly to work in the economy. The widespread administering of vaccines is now set to release the constraints of the pandemic and unleash the unprecedented pipeline of fiscal and monetary stimulus.<br />A few episodes from history stand out as parallels. After World War II, concerns that aggregate demand would slump and the economy would shrink led the Treasury to pressure the Fed to maintain its artificially low interest-rate pegs. Contrary to expectations, a surge of pent up household savings and massive Fed liquidity resulted in strong economic growth, and inflation—up to 15% a year by 1948.</td>

One administration after another, Democrat and Republican, enabled Unrwa to perpetuate its fiction. It’s time for a new U.S. policy that promotes regional peace, advances Palestinian human rights and defends the U.S. taxpayer.<br />History can explain, in part, how this mess was created. In 1948, five Arab armies invaded the fledgling state of Israel but lost. Unrwa was established to care for Arab residents displaced by that conflict. The organization was dedicated solely to Palestinian Arabs—independent of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which took responsibility for all other world refugee populations.<br />Unrwa became part of a new Arab narrative: Millions of Palestinians were trapped as refugees, living in destitution and yearning for home. Until these people achieved their “right of return,” the Arab world insisted, the Middle East would never see peace. Meanwhile, Israel absorbed 800,000 Jewish refugees who were exiled from Arab states.<br />Over time, America somehow allowed itself to become Unrwa’s leading donor. From 1950 to 2018, American taxpayers contributed more than $6 billion, even as legislators from both parties raised concerns about the agency. Employees moonlighted as terrorists. Schools were used to store weapons and launch rockets against Israel. Concerns in Congress mounted over waste, fraud and abuse.</td>

But this past week’s frenzy around  GameStop  and other stocks highlighted some potential downsides of this small-trader wave.<br />Moves by some trading platforms including Robinhood Markets to restrict some trading at times drew huge scrutiny from customers and politicians. Even shares of far bigger firms, such Charles Schwab, which now also owns TD Ameritrade, and  Morgan Stanley ,  which now owns E*Trade, were sold off sharply last week.<br />Those shares have rallied so far this week. But the question investors may be considering is whether a sustained explosion of trading is ultimately good for the online-trading business.<br />From a revenue standpoint, the absence of commissions and little return on customer cash due to superlow interest rates increases reliance on other revenue sources, like margin lending and payment-for-order flow. So called PFOF in particular, which involves sending customers’ trading orders to wholesale market-making firms, has drawn huge attention over the past week. Whether warranted or not, regulatory changes or customer demands that limit this revenue source could make volume much less valuable.</td>

As of January 2021, the Department of Transportation (DOT) began cracking down, limiting the types of furry companions allowed to fly in airline cabins free of charge. There is now only one acceptable candidate: a service animal. A service animal is not a pet; it’s a dog, highly and specifically trained to aid an “individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability,” according to the DOT. Official documentation is required in advance of travel. Other pets can still fly in the cabin on most U.S. airlines—including Alaska Airlines and  JetBlue —but for a fee (in the $125 range, each way) and only if they fit in a carrier under the seat. Rules vary but that generally disqualifies all animals but those about 25 pounds or under. If Spot is a healthy, 70-pound Dalmatian, cargo is an option, and some airlines like Delta have stepped up, with climate-controlled hold areas for live animals, specially trained personnel and strict weather guidelines.

That year, the game was at 6:25 p.m., five minutes earlier than 6:30 p.m. In 2009, it was at 6 p.m. In 2008, it was at 6:17 p.m. On four occasions, it was even at 6:18 p.m. The NFL has dabbled in much experimentation during the six o’clock hour before finding the comfort of 6:30 p.m.<br />There are, however, some things about the big game that vary from year to year. That’s especially true in 2021 for an event that will look like never before with the country in the throes of a global pandemic. So here’s your quick guide to everything about the 55th Super Bowl, otherwise known as Super Bowl LV.<br />The Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That’s especially exciting because of the teams’ two quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady—the last two to win the Super Bowl.<br />Mahomes led the Chiefs to last year’s title. Brady has won six and this will be his 10th Super Bowl appearance. But the previous nine came with the New England Patriots, the team he left after last season. It’s a generational battle between the 43-year-old Brady and the 25-year-old Mahomes. One is toward the end of an all-time career. The other is at the beginning of one.</td>

      <td>America’s small businesses remain under stress from coronavirus pandemic disruptions, and many of them say continued government support is crucial to their survival, according to a new report from the Federal Reserve’s 12 regional banks released on Wednesday.<br />Just under 90% of companies surveyed by the Fed banks said business had not returned to pre-pandemic levels almost a year after the crisis began. Of those that lost ground, 30% said that without more government aid, their companies might not survive, the report said.<br />The survey, an annual project that tallied nearly 10,000 respondents from firms with 500 or fewer employees, found that almost all small firms reported some negative impact from the pandemic, with 78% reporting a drop in income and just under half cutting their workforce in response to reduced demand. Just over half of the firms said revenue for last year is likely to have fallen by more than 25%. The survey was carried out in October and November.<br />The Fed noted in the report that while it surveyed conditions among small businesses, it is those businesses that represent 99.7% of all employers. The report arrives as the Biden administration and Congress are debating another round of economic stimulus to help the economy navigate and escape the effects of the pandemic, which has had a withering impact on business and hiring, both in the United States and in other nations.<br />The Fed is itself providing significant support via ultra low rates and bond-buying efforts aimed at keeping the cost of credit low. Emergency lending programs offered by the Fed, which in many cases saw relatively light usage, have been curtailed. The Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, however, has been relaunched.</td>

Amazon said Tuesday that Mr. Bezos would transition out of the CEO seat in the third quarter.<br />Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, told analysts Tuesday that Mr. Bezos would remain involved in what Amazon terms “one-way door” issues—the big, irreversible decisions, such as acquisitions or getting into the grocery business, that can’t be easily undone once they are initiated.<br />“Jeff’s always been involved with that, and that’s where we’ll keep his time focused on,” Mr. Olsavsky said.</td>

He had been asked to provide an outfit for Vice President Kamala Harris but knew other designers had also submitted offerings. The choice wouldn’t be clear until she appeared. When she emerged, she was wearing his purple coat and dress.<br />“We didn’t know what would happen so we were just kind of watching generally, and then when she came out, we were very, very excited,” Mr. Rogers says. “I was speechless.”<br />Throughout that morning, Mr. Rogers heard commentators repeat his name live on air while social media lit up with mentions, spreading his name across the world. He and his team fielded congratulatory phone calls, messages and inquiries—and celebrated the moment. “We had mimosas,” Mr. Rogers says.</td>

As the coronavirus pandemic made this year’s recruiting scramble, chaotic, Clemson even rolled out its own custom video-chat platform—in bright orange, of course—to give its assistants a way to stand out in a sea of Zooms and FaceTimes.<br />It’s one reason why Clemson will again boast one of the nation’s top recruiting classes when the dust settles from National Signing Day on Feb. 3.<br />About seven years ago in the early days of the Swinney era, as Clemson sat on the cusp of unprecedented success, the university realized that in order to take its gridiron performance to the next level, it also had to invest behind the scenes in how it marketed to recruits. Swinney persuaded athletic director Dan Radakovich to add a “director of new media” to the athletic department’s payroll to improve its storytelling chops and hired Jonathan Gantt, then the media coordinator for the Tampa Bay Rays who oversaw the team’s social accounts.</td>

Traders sought additional information online and pointed to myriad bits of information to infer a deal was imminent. One online discussion prompted a trader to drive to an airport to photograph a jet that other traders conjectured was connected to the deal.<br />The stock has surged more than 220% since the report last month, the biggest-ever stock increase of a special-purpose acquisition company before announcing a merger, according to SPACinsider.com. Talks between the two companies are continuing, though a deal isn’t imminent, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Such stock run-ups historically have been uncommon for SPACs, and even after they announce merger targets, their shares rarely jump so significantly. That is because the SPACs are paying what they believe to be a market price for the company they are merging with, so in theory, the shares shouldn’t surge unless they are undervaluing their target company.</td>

In May, when it had confirmed 509 Covid-19 infections and 21 deaths, the government stopped reporting cases to the World Health Organization, after Mr. Magufuli insisted that Tanzania had conquered the pandemic and that test kits showing positive results were faulty.<br />This week, Tanzanian Health Minister Dorothy Gwajima said the country had no intention of importing Covid-19 vaccines, including free doses it could get from the global Covax initiative, which aims to supply shots to poor and middle-income countries.<br />“We are not yet satisfied that those vaccines have been clinically proven safe,” Dr. Gwajima said at a news conference, flanked by unmasked government health officials.<br />The only other African countries that have opted to forgo the free Covax vaccines are Burundi, Eritrea and the island state of Madagascar, according to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which manages the initiative along with the WHO. Other early Covid-19 deniers, such as Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko—who last spring called the coronavirus a “psychosis” that could be fought with vodka, saunas and driving tractors—have since accepted vaccines.</td>

When he was eliminating jobs at Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. in the early 1990s, newspapers dubbed him “Jack the Ripper.”<br />Mr. Grundhofer, who grew up poor as the son of a bartender in Glendale, Calif., wasn’t easily intimidated. Through a long series of acquisitions, he created what became today’s U.S. Bancorp., the nation’s fifth-largest banking company in terms of assets.<br />He learned early in his career to clamp down on costs. “I’ll do whatever I have to do, however Draconian,” he told The Wall Street Journal in 1993. “Shareholders are looking for someone to protect their livelihood. You have to manage tough to survive.”<br />Mr. Grundhofer died Jan. 24 at his home in Indian Wells, Calif. He was 82. The cause of death was pneumonia, unrelated to Covid-19, his wife, Patti Grundhofer, said.<br />Soon after arriving as the new chief executive at First Bank in 1990, Mr. Grundhofer began eliminating about 20% of the workforce. Stung by criticism of his swift job cuts, he said in a letter to the Journal that he didn’t enjoy firing people. “If we had not been successful in making the tough choices to turn around this company,” he added, “there easily could have been 10,000 people out of work, instead of 2,000.”</td>

      <td>National Football League teams suffered outbreaks and postponements during the 2020 season, but one thing seemed immune to the coronavirus: the allure of the NFL brand.<br />Sponsors at the league, team and venue level committed a total of $1.62 billion to the NFL during the 2020-21 season that ends with Sunday’s Super Bowl, according to sponsorship consultancy IEG. That amount led the four major North American sports leagues and represented a 10% increase from the previous year, roughly twice the NFL’s typical year-over-year sponsorship growth.<br />The extra growth was driven largely by $55 million in new spending for the naming rights of Las Vegas’s Allegiant Stadium and Los Angeles’s SoFi Stadium. But the NFL and its teams also saw their usual array of sponsors expand to include betting and teeth-straightening companies.<br />“One of the things that sort of prevents disruption is stability,” said Peter Laatz, global managing director at IEG. “And the NFL has always been a model of stability.”<br />The NFL’s sponsorship bump, however, isn’t yet money in the bank. Some sponsors are trying to claw back some cash or stretch out their deals, mainly because of in-stadium crowd restrictions and other Covid-related drags on the value of sponsorships, Laatz said. Most of the brands IEG has spoken with are extending the length of their deals without adding extra payment, he said.</td>

      <td>Kraft Heinz is close to fetching a very attractive price for its Planters business. Next, it must use the proceeds wisely.<br />The company might reach a deal to sell the business to  Hormel Foods  as soon as next week for around $3 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.<br />At first glance the nuts category is an attractive one, fitting the contemporary trend toward healthier, protein-based snacks. But it also lends itself to competition and commoditization: private-label brands hold about a one-third share, according to Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar.<br />Compounding the problem has been years of underinvestment in the brand under Kraft Heinz’s old mantra of cost-cutting above all. This left Planters largely confined to plain canned peanuts, while competitors invested in products such as flavored almonds marketed as an alternative to chips. Wells Fargo analyst John Baumgartner estimates that Planters’ market share fell around 7 percentage points to 18% between 2016 and 2019.<br />It appears to be a natural fit for Hormel’s protein-focused portfolio of meats and nut butters, but it might be overpaying. At $3 billion, Planters would be going for around three times 2019 sales, according to Wells Fargo’s Mr. Baumgartner. That would be a similar valuation to  Campbell Soup ’s  acquisition of organic soup brand Pacific Foods in 2017 and  Danone ’s  2016 deal for organic specialist WhiteWave Foods, maker of the Horizon organic milk brand, Mr. Baumgartner notes. But those are both more premium categories with better growth potential.</td>

      <td>The elevation of Andy Jassy to become  Amazon.com Inc.’s  next chief executive of is one of the clearest signs yet that fortunes in the tech industry are increasingly made in the cloud.<br />Mr. Jassy was instrumental in helping to transform the online retailing giant he joined in 1997 into a juggernaut in cloud-computing, the business of renting servers and software to customers largely on a pay-as-you-go model. It is a market that could top $300 billion globally this year, according to research firm  Gartner Inc.,  and pits Amazon against tech giants like  Microsoft Corp.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google.<br />The battle for the cloud is playing out across industries—from videogames and cars to space—and companies large and small.<br />For Amazon, cloud computing has been a booming business that is massively lucrative. Amazon Web Services, or AWS,  generated little more than 10% of Amazon’s total sales in the final quarter of last year but yielded more than half the company’s operating profit in the period. AWS revenue advanced 28% over those three months from the previous year to $12.7 billion, and its operating profit was $3.6 billion.<br />For executives, the cloud is increasingly becoming a stepping-stone at tech companies. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ran the software giant’s cloud business before being elevated to the top job in 2014.  International Business Machines Corp.  last year turned to its cloud chief when it came to naming a new CEO to help revive growth.</td>

Two of the five best motion-picture drama nominees this year were Netflix films: “Mank,” a black-and-white love letter to old Hollywood and “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” about the defendants charged with conspiracy after 1968 protests.<br />Nominations for best motion-picture direction went to three women for the first time, including debut feature filmmakers Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) and Regina King (“One Night in Miami”), along with director Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”). It was a departure from last year, when the Globes were slammed for snubbing women in that high-profile category.<br />Favorites like Chadwick Boseman earned much expected recognition. Mr. Boseman is in contention for best actor in a movie drama for “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” which includes a scene where his character rails against the idea of a merciful God. It would be a posthumous win for the actor, whose death after a private battle with cancer shocked fans last summer.<br />On the TV side, new shows that doubled as pandemic binge fare like “Ted Lasso,” “Lovecraft Country” and “The Flight Attendant,” along with crowd pleasers “The Crown,” “Schitt’s Creek” and “Ozark” from pre-Covid days, emerged as strong contenders by the famously quirky Hollywood Foreign Press Association, whose roughly 90 members do the voting.</td>

The obscure allegation was little more than a means to justify Ms. Suu Kyi’s detention, which shook the country and drew widespread global condemnation, experts and human-rights groups say.<br />The military and police didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />The coup marked a sudden reversal of Myanmar’s fragile transition from military rule to democracy, which began about a decade ago. Myanmar’s military claims elections held in November, which were won by Ms. Suu Kyi’s party in a landslide, were marred by voter fraud. Election officials have denied the claims.</td>

The company counts more than 300 insurers, 25,000 collision-repair facilities, dozens of auto makers and thousands of parts suppliers as its clients. Its technology connects these parties to get claims handled and vehicles repaired after wrecks.<br />The 41-year-old business, majority-owned by private-equity firm Advent International, is part of a wave of companies making their public-market debuts through SPACs rather than traditional initial public offerings. SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, turn the IPO process on its head by going public and raising cash without a business, and then searching for one to combine with.<br />The blank-check company in this case,  Dragoneer Growth Opportunities Corp. , went public in August, raising $690 million.</td>

      <td>Some consumer groups don’t think rates have come down enough</td>
      <td>Car-insurance rates for American vehicle owners fell by nearly 4% on average nationally in 2020 as carriers adjusted prices for reduced traffic volume and other pandemic-related changes in driving patterns, according to Zebra, an insurance price-comparison website.<br />The decline is the first nationally since 2013, Zebra said. In addition to these rate reductions, which take effect for new customers and as existing policies renew, many policyholders received premium refunds of about 15% to 20% a month from insurers in the spring. Back then, stay-at-home directives led to a plunge in nationwide mileage and, in turn, a sharp drop in wrecks.<br />The rate reductions bring the average annual car-insurance bill to $1,483, down 3.9%, Zebra said. Car insurance represents the biggest single line of business for U.S. property-casualty carriers, with $248 billion of annual premium in 2019 paid by consumers, according to trade group Insurance Information Institute.<br />It is unclear if U.S. consumers will applaud the industry cuts.<br />In releasing its annual report on rate trend Wednesday, Zebra noted that many consumers have wondered why their premium bills haven’t dropped more dramatically. Many continue to work from home with their vehicles parked all day.</td>

      <td>Hotels and other businesses that draw U.S. tourists abroad are scrambling to make testing for the virus as easy as possible</td>
      <td>Hotels are scrambling. Airports are strategizing. Airlines are creating new apps.<br />Travel companies are rushing to make Covid-19 testing a regular part of international travel—as easy as checking a bag—to stem cancellations and get travelers traveling again.<br />A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention order that requires anyone entering the U.S. to have a Covid-19 test within 72 hours of boarding triggered a massive travel-industry effort to make it easy for guests and passengers to comply. PCR tests and rapid antigen tests satisfy the requirement; rapid antibody tests don’t.<br />The order, announced Jan. 12, led to widespread confusion and cancellations, travel sellers say. Airlines Reporting Corp., which processes tickets sold by travel agencies, says that in December, tickets purchased for domestic trips tracked right with international tickets, both at 40% of 2019 sales. That continued into January, then split after the CDC announcement. By the week ended Sunday, preliminary data show domestic air tickets still close to 40% of the 2019 total, but international tickets fell to only 23% of 2019 sales.<br />“As soon as that announcement went into effect, it felt like last March a little bit. Overnight it just decimated business again,” says Zane Kerby, chief executive of the American Society of Travel Advisors.</td>

      <td>Whether you have $100 or $10,000 to spend, here’s expert advice on the most strategic, single piece of gear to invest in</td>
      <td>WHEN MY GYM closed its doors back in March, I needed to find a way to stay active (and sane) without turning my 700-square-foot condo into an unofficial Equinox outpost. My solution: a single pair of adjustable dumbbells that work for all sorts of strength-building moves, from bench presses to squats, and take up little room in my already cramped closet. But even if you live in a vast ranch house, fitness experts agree, nobody requires a suite of gym-rat gear to get an efficient total-body workout. In many cases, you only have to budget for a single, strategic piece of equipment. (And, no, a Peloton isn’t your only option.) Here, five products you can rely on for multiple fitness needs, whether you’re a taut pauper or someone with more money (and calories) to burn.<br />With a free weight, your muscles only engage while working against gravity. When you use these jumbo rubber bands, your muscles also have to withstand the tension of the loop. That makes them an incredibly flexible tool for improving mobility, stability and muscular strength, according to CrossFit co-founder Lauren Jenai. A typical move: With the band around your calves, assume a squat and shuffle sideways. Made from durable natural latex that doesn’t irritate sweaty skin, Fit Simplify’s set lets you choose from five different levels of stretchiness depending on how much opposition your muscles are ready to face. Plus, unlike a clunky machine, you can easily stash the bands out of sight. ($16, fitsimplify.com)<br />You could steal a $3 jump rope from your daughter—if you’re willing to risk ending up on the floor bound in a jump-rope web. This adult-sized weighted version not only lets you avoid that fate, it adds resistance for a double-whammy of cardio and strength building, said PJ Shirdan, a trainer for the at-home boxing platform FightCamp. The Get Lean comes with interchangeable quarter-pound and half-pound ropes and flexible handles for more comfort. Jumping steadily can take the place of an easy run or ride, or you can vary your speed for a high-intensity workout that burns more calories in less time. ($99, crossrope.com)<br />Hang these adjustable straps from a beam or shut the anchor piece in a door frame. When you place your palms on the handles and push the straps away from you to perform a chest press, for example, it creates an unstable dynamic that your body has to work against to control your movement. As you try to keep your limbs from flailing, your body has to work harder than if it were pushing against solid resistance, said Kenny Santucci, founder of workout program Strong New York. Not only are your working muscles engaged, so are smaller stabilizer muscles that don’t get as much attention. Adjusting your body’s angle (picture moving your feet closer to or further from the door frame) can increase the challenge, he added. The whole system comes down as easy as it goes up, letting you build muscle without marring your home. ($185, trxtraining.com)<br />If you value your decor, you’re unlikely to do a squat jump onto your coffee table. That said, jump (or plyometric) training helps you build speed and power more affordably than many machines allow. This firm foam box can handle up to 450 pounds without tipping you onto the hardwood and comes cloaked in a durable no-slip surface, welcoming punishment in ways furniture can’t. Depending on how you orient the box, you have three heights to choose from, which allows you to create a home workout that includes both jumps and strength-building exercises such as incline push-ups, step-ups and single-leg lunges. Sessions with the Plyo Box leave you with “increased metabolism and fat-burning capacities well after your workout is complete,” said Ms. Jenai. ($150, shopepicfitness.com)</td>

      <td>After the pandemic, budget carriers are expected to grow in more congested markets while keeping costs low. Doing both has proven tricky before.</td>
      <td>For vaccine optimists, there may be no clearer way to bet on the recovery than investing in budget airlines. But much depends on whether these low-cost carriers can remain, well, low cost.<br />This week, Dublin-based  Ryanair  reported fourth-quarter earnings well short of analyst expectations. Last week,  Southwest Airlines  managed to surpass forecasts but issued gloomy guidance for the current quarter. It is still up in the air whether leisure travel can reopen in time for the high-summer season.<br />But investors know that, sooner or later, the exit from the pandemic will play in favor of budget airlines and against their full-service competitors. Short-haul traffic will bounce back before international flights, and corporate travelers will be fewer and more price-conscious.<br />The rub is that the market has already priced a lot of this in: On average, the shares of low-cost carriers are back roughly to where they were a year ago, even though their revenues are only forecast to catch up with pre-pandemic trends around 2025. To meet expectations amid heavy discounting, they will need to come out of the Covid crisis making a lot more money with fewer sales.<br />Which is to say, with structurally lower costs. This is their challenge.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department on Wednesday announced few changes to its regular debt issuance schedule for the current quarter, while emphasizing the government continues to face uncertain and sizable borrowing needs due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The agency intends to maintain the size of nominal coupon auction sizes this quarter, after ramping up auction sizes last year to accommodate a surge in government spending to combat the pandemic and cushion the U.S. economy.<br />“Treasury believes that these changes have created sufficient capacity to address near-term projected borrowing needs,” said Brian Smith, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, in a statement on the agency’s quarterly borrowing needs.<br />The Treasury also will continue to gradually increase auction sizes for Treasury inflation-protected securities, as announced in November, boosting the size of those auctions by $10 billion to $20 billion over the 2021 calendar year.<br />The borrowing plans are consistent with expectations from the vast majority of primary dealers and recommendations from a Treasury borrowing advisory committee, a senior Treasury official said Wednesday morning. The plans also preserve flexibility for Treasury, in light of potential uncertainty about government spending and the possibility for another economic relief package in Congress, the official said.</td>

      <td>Nail experts and a clinical psychologist offer actionable tips for quitting—as do two of our manicure-mangling fashion editors</td>
      <td>BITING YOUR nails can be absorbingly compulsive, but it’s an incredibly dirty habit—even more so when absentmindedly sticking unwashed fingers in your mouth could increase your chances of contracting Covid-19. If the threat of a potentially deadly virus won’t make you stop gnawing, what will? For starters, you need to look at nail-biting as more than a “pesky habit,” said Dr. Rebecca Rialon Berry, Ph.D., a New York clinical psychologist.<br />Often accompanied by a desire to chew on your cuticles and hangnails (which, counterintuitively, aren’t nails at all but rather rough bits of dry skin), nail-biting is a body-focused repetitive behavior that helps us cope with anxiety, stress and boredom. Thanks to the many sensory receptors in the fingertips, ruining your manicure provides comfort, focus or both. Identify your triggers: Do work deadlines make you bite, or are nosy inlaws driving you to nibble? Then “get some physical and psychological space” from these triggers, advised Dr. Berry, and work on taking the edge off.<br />As alternative ways to relieve stress, masochists could try grueling physical activities like push-ups, while zen-seekers should regularly take deep breaths. If you’re too rattled to inhale intensely, hold ice cubes. Ice gripping can regulate your temperature and, in turn, your emotions, leaving you better equipped to take deep, calming breaths and leave your nails alone.<br />If these techniques don’t break the nail-biting pattern, Dr. Berry suggests you cover your fingertips with rubber caps or tape (not ideal if you’re stuck at a laptop all day) or getting a “fiddle basket” full of items that will keep your hands busy, like Theraputty, a stress ball or a tactile Pin Art toy.<br />If you’re still gnawing away, consider a cosmetic strategy. Removing temptation by maintaining short nails is an obvious option, but there are more attractive answers. Julie Kandalec, a New York celebrity manicurist, said her top tip is investing in a good pair of cuticle clippers that can snip hangnails—or dead skin. “If there’s nothing to feel, there’s nothing to pick,” she said, also stressing the importance of moisturizing your cuticles. Keep a sanitized pair of clippers, along with a nail file, by your side at all times so you can replace biting with (gentle) pruning.</td>

      <td>Former ECB President Mario Draghi has been asked to form a new government in Italy</td>
      <td>Italian government bonds rallied as investors cheered the news that former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi had been asked to form a new government.<br />The gap between yields on 10-year Italian bonds and their German equivalents fell to the tightest level in nearly five years, at 1.027 percentage points, according to  Tradeweb .  Yields fall when bond prices rise. Italy’s stock market also rallied, with the FTSE MIB benchmark up 2.6%.<br />Italy’s coalition government collapsed in January over arguments about how to spend European Union funding meant to spur the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Draghi, who was credited as ECB chief with saving the eurozone from its political and financial crisis in 2012, is seen by investors as a safe, technocratic leader capable of helping Italy out of its worst recession since World War II.<br />The market reaction suggests investors think Mr. Draghi can govern for a while and enact reforms, said Sebastien Galy, a macro strategist at  Nordea Asset Management .  But there are no guarantees.<br />“Should he fail to form a government, a snap election would be called, and the odds are still moderate that this will happen given the fractious nature of Italian politics,” Mr. Galy said.</td>

      <td>Robinhood Markets Inc. will advertise during the Super Bowl, as the online brokerage seeks to repair its image in the wake of the  GameStop Corp.  stock-trading saga.<br />Robinhood faced a backlash from customers and some lawmakers after it restricted trading on certain highflying stocks last week. Critics said the move ran counter to the brand’s mission of democratizing investing. Robinhood said the restrictions were put in place so it could meet the obligations of a clearinghouse that finalizes trades.<br />On Sunday, the company is expected to air a 30-second commercial during Super Bowl LV with the message that anyone can invest. The ad features a montage of ordinary people going about their lives—a young man going for a jog, a dad taking care of his infant, a woman dying her hair.<br />“We make short-term investments, long-term investments, we diversify our interests, realize our gains and losses, and try to keep the big picture in mind,” the narrator in the ad says. “You don’t need to become an investor, you were born one.”<br />Robinhood purchased the Super Bowl ad time, which has been selling for roughly $5.5 million for 30 seconds, in December. Amid the recent controversy, executives at the Silicon Valley startup discussed pulling out of the big game or creating a new ad, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company decided to move ahead with the commercial after seeing a surge in interest in the service—even with the negative publicity—the person said.</td>

Investors have focused instead on better-than-expected corporate results and bets that President Biden will deliver more fiscal spending in coming weeks.<br />“The last two days have seen the return of the feeling that we still have monetary stimulus in the background and the prospect of an additional stimulus package to come,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Advisors. “The path ahead isn’t a smooth one, but we think it is an upward one.”<br />Shares in Alphabet climbed over 7% in premarket trading after the parent of Google said late Tuesday that it had booked record revenue in the fourth quarter.</td>

The litigation is a particularly contentious example of the legal pushback startups face from legacy companies—increasingly the norm over the past decade for disruptive new businesses from Uber to  Airbnb ,  experts said.<br />Careismatic Brands, a leader in medical apparel with brands of scrubs like Cherokee and Dickies, has pursued litigation against Figs since 2019, saying the smaller company has misled health-care workers with boasts about how its products help keep them safe.<br />Figs’s advertising and social-media presence look more like those of a fashion brand than a medical-apparel maker, including sometimes irreverent videos and images of people wearing Figs while getting out of helicopters, skiing and skateboarding. Its online-sales model, aimed at selling directly to medical professionals, contrasts with Careismatic’s heavy reliance on bricks-and-mortar retailers.<br />Careismatic, previously known as Strategic Partners Inc., has asked a federal judge in Riverside, Calif., to issue an injunction requiring Figs to publicly renounce some marketing claims, including that its scrubs kill bacteria and infection on contact, repel liquids and reduce hospital-acquired infections by 66%.</td>

      <td>Former ECB president will begin talks with Italy’s parties in a nation skeptical of technocrats but in need of new direction</td>
      <td>ROME—Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, was formally tasked by Italy’s president on Wednesday with forming a government of national unity to steer the country out of its political, economic and health crises.<br />Italy is turning to Mr. Draghi, one of Europe’s most respected public officials, at a time when it needs to shore up its credibility within the European Union, which last year promised to help finance Italy’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic but this month has looked askance at Rome, where the  government collapsed amid squabbles over how to spend the EU money, as well as personal animosities between politicians.<br />Financial markets welcomed the nomination of Mr. Draghi. Milan’s main stock-market index gained 2% Wednesday morning. The risk premium on Italian government bonds compared with supersafe German bonds declined to the lowest level for nearly five years.<br />Mr. Draghi, as ECB president, is widely credited with defusing the eurozone’s sovereign-debt crisis in 2012 by promising to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. His supporters hope Mr. Draghi can intervene with similar effectiveness in Italy’s economic policies. The country’s chronically weak growth for more than two decades is seen by many economists as the greatest threat to the euro’s long-term viability.<br />First, however, Mr. Draghi has to persuade a majority of lawmakers in a fragmented Parliament to support him. So far, only centrist parties have come out publicly in support, despite President Sergio Mattarella’s appeal for unity across partisan divides. To become prime minister, Mr. Draghi will need the support of the populist 5 Star Movement or the nationalist League. Both parties have in the past rejected the idea of governments led by economists and technocrats such as Mr. Draghi.</td>

      <td>Sony, like most gaming companies, has done exceptionally well this year. But it is also positioning itself cannily for the post-pandemic world.</td>
      <td>Gamers already snap up  Sony ’s  offerings, as the company’s blockbuster December quarter just demonstrated again. The movies and music business will soon be feeling its deepening influence too.<br />The Japanese electronics and entertainment giant said its operating profit for the quarter ended December rose 20% from a year earlier, driven by stay-at-home demand for its games. Revenue at its gaming division jumped 40% year-over-year—its best quarter ever. Sony also expects operating profit at the division this fiscal year ending in March will reach a record high.<br />Production bottlenecks have restricted shipments of new PlayStation 5 consoles, but the company still managed to sell 4.5 million units during the quarter. The new console, however, likely isn’t profitable after the initial marketing and development costs. The profit boost likely came from selling more games, especially digitally, in the quarter. Revenue from digital games and add-ons grew 65% from a year earlier. Its subscription service for gamers PlayStation Plus added 1.5 million subscribers during the quarter.<br />Sony raised its operating income outlook for this fiscal year by 34% to ¥940 billion, equivalent to $9 billion, which implies an 11% year-over-year increase. The company originally expected a decline in operating profit, mainly due to worries about its image sensor business. The segment did suffer a decline, but demand from Apple’s new iPhones helped soften the blow.<br />What is more encouraging is that Sony’s entertainment businesses outside of gaming are also going well. Its movie segment was hurt by theater closures, but that was more than offset by higher income from licensing content. Music streaming revenues continued to be strong. Aniplex, its anime production company under the music segment, has helped distribute the animated movie “Demon Slayer,” which has notched an all-time box office record in Japan. The popularity of the franchise could also provide opportunities for Sony’s game and music businesses.</td>

      <td>LSE’s big bet on data comes as Refinitiv has steadily lost market share against its main rival</td>
      <td><br />Now that the  London Stock Exchange  Group PLC has completed its $15 billion acquisition of financial data company Refinitiv Holdings Ltd., the next big test is proving it can reclaim at least some of the ground it has lost to industry heavyweight Bloomberg LP.<br />Refinitiv competes against Bloomberg selling an array of financial-data to the finance industry. Yet, Refinitiv’s share of the market against its rival has been declining for years. That underscores the LSE’s challenge, particularly given that some users say Bloomberg’s ubiquitous data terminal that is found on institutional trading desks around the world is more expensive than the equivalent from Refinitiv.<br />The company’s slice of the global market data pie as measured by revenue fell from a market-leading 32% in 2010 to 21% in 2019, according to data from Burton-Taylor, the research and advisory arm of London-based brokerage TP ICAP. Over the same period, Bloomberg’s share climbed from 29% to 33%.<br />Bloomberg and Refinitiv compete with Dow Jones & Co., the parent company of The Wall Street Journal.</td>

      <td>Match’s flame has cooled amid the pandemic, but sparks will soon fly again</td>
      <td>With the world on lockdown for much of 2020, dating company  Match Group Inc.  got stood up by plenty of investors. Now, the pressure is on to win them back.<br />Match showed impressive resilience early on in the pandemic, making use of its virtual lines of communication for singles to continue to mingle remotely. Tuesday’s fourth-quarter results were no exception, slightly topping Wall Street’s estimates for sales and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.<br />Match’s shares—often volatile heading into quarterly earnings to begin with—took a dive in mid-January following competitor Bumble’s initial public offering filing, but had since recovered most of those losses. Then its shares tumbled again 5% after hours following Tuesday’s report, which included conservative first-quarter guidance, particularly on the bottom line in what the company said is typically a lower-margin period.<br />Investors shouldn’t be overly discouraged: Match entered the fourth quarter having outperformed the midpoint of its initial guidance by between 3% and 14% over the past three years, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. Impressively, its fourth-quarter numbers show it also met its initial revenue guidance for 2020, given way back in early November of 2019, before the first case of Covid-19 had even been identified.<br />For the past few years, the Match story has revolved around hookup app Tinder’s rapid growth. It now makes up well over half of the company’s overall revenue. Seeing this, many investors stepped to the sidelines amid the pandemic, as immediate gratification in online dating became as elusive as Lysol wipes and paper towels. Tinder’s annual direct revenue growth moderated from 43% in 2019 to just 18% last year.</td>

      <td>Apollo Global Management Inc.  reported higher fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday as the private-equity giant’s business weathered a storm kicked up by Chief Executive Leon Black’s ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.<br />The New York firm posted net income of $434.1 million, or $1.80 a share, up from earnings of $166 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. Driving that was a 14% increase in fee-related earnings. Apollo’s private-equity portfolio also appreciated 13% during the quarter compared with an 11.7% increase for the S&P 500.<br />But the firm’s financial performance may once again be overshadowed by Mr. Black’s relationship with Epstein, who was indicted in 2019 on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls and later died by suicide in jail.<br />A recently concluded review by Dechert LLP backed up Mr. Black’s assertion that fees he paid Epstein, which the law firm said totaled $158 million, were for legitimate tax- and estate-planning advice. It found no evidence he was involved in Epstein’s criminal activities.<br />The question for Apollo’s shareholders is whether Mr. Black’s decision to cede the CEO role to co-founder Marc Rowan, announced with the findings of the review last week, will be enough to put to rest concerns of public pension funds and other institutions that commit money to the firm’s funds. Some had said they would hold off on new investments with the firm until they learned the findings of the review.</td>

      <td>When the city of Tonghua in China’s northeast shut residents in their homes in response to new coronavirus cases in January, it forced a reckoning with some harsh economic realities in the aging rust-belt city.<br />Thousands complained on social media that they were running out of necessities such as food and medicine. It was the kind of hardship that hadn’t been seen since the lockdown of Wuhan for the first Covid-19 outbreak a year earlier. As many pleaded that they were starving, saying “Don’t forget us,” city officials apologized and said they were short-handed.<br />The city of around 2 million, near the North Korean border, is one of many in the northeast that have fallen on hard times as China has restructured its overbuilt steel industry. Growth is markedly slower and many younger people have left in search of work.<br />Nearly one in four residents in Tonghua is 60 years old or older, compared with a national average of about 18%, official data show. The city now has less money coming in while also having more retirees to support—fault lines that became more obvious in its draconian pandemic response.<br />Last year, Tonghua only reported six cases of Covid-19. But in January, after at least 49 residents who had visited a center selling health-care products for the elderly tested positive, a downtown section of the city became the most locked-down place in China. City officials taped apartment doors shut in entire housing complexes practically overnight.</td>

      <td>Spotify Technology SA  posted stronger-than-expected subscription growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 as more listeners tuned into music and podcasts from home amid the coronavirus pandemic. Still, the streaming giant offered a conservative outlook for the current year as new sign-ups could ebb.<br />At the end of the fourth quarter, Spotify had 345 million monthly active users, hitting the high end of its guidance, an increase of 27% from the same period a year ago. Paying subscribers, its most lucrative type of customer, grew to 155 million, up 24% from the same period a year ago, and topping expectations.<br />Average revenue per user for the subscription business fell 8% to €4.26, the equivalent of $5.13, from a year ago, as the company continued to attract new subscribers via discounted plans and charge lower prices in new markets such as India and Russia. In October, Spotify raised the price of its family plan in seven markets, a move the company said didn’t affect churn or customer intake. In February, it expanded price increases to another 25 markets, including in Europe, Latin America and Canada.<br />Revenue from subscriptions rose 15% from the year before, to €1.89 billion. Advertising revenue grew for a second consecutive quarter after sliding in the first half of the year amid pandemic headwinds, jumping 29% to €281 million. Advertising, historically less than 10% of Spotify’s top line, accounted for 13% of revenue. It has become a growth area as the company expands its podcast business.<br />The company said it now has 2.2 million podcasts available on its service, and consumption hours nearly doubled from the prior-year quarter. During the period, 25% of its monthly active users listened to a podcast, up from 22% in the previous quarter. In December, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” which arrived on Spotify in September, became exclusive to the service. It is the No. 1 show in 17 markets, and has helped bring in new users as well as attract first-time podcast listeners, the company said.</td>

President Biden has said an equitable distribution of small-business aid is a priority as his administration seeks to address racial and economic inequality.<br />Lawmakers from both parties have praised the program for providing a vital lifeline to small businesses during the pandemic. Still, it has faced scrutiny over potential fraud and concerns the loans weren’t sufficiently reaching mom-and-pop and minority-owned firms.<br />Those concerns followed the program’s rocky rollout last spring, as businesses without existing relationships with lenders—which issue the loans—struggled to access the program early on.</td>

      <td>White House says a raise would help workers; opponents warn of job cuts</td>
      <td>President Biden says his proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour will lift many low-wage workers out of poverty, but some businesses and economists warn it could cost jobs as the U.S. recovers from pandemic layoffs.<br />Mr. Biden endorses a plan to more than double the wage in steps over four years, noting that at $15 an hour, a job could support a family of four and it wouldn’t live in poverty. The president’s advisers also say raising the wage from $7.25 an hour, where it has stood since 2009, would show gratitude to essential workers at grocery stores and warehouses who stayed on the job during the coronavirus pandemic and would boost the economy by allowing low-wage workers to spend more.<br />Some large national employers have done well during the pandemic, Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of Mr. Biden’s National Economic Council, said in an interview. “The compensation for their employees hasn’t necessarily reflected that. Raising the minimum wage is one way of giving workers a more fair slice of the revenues that they help generate.”<br />Several states, including California, Florida and Massachusetts are already on a path to reach a $15 minimum wage in coming years, but Mr. Ramamurti said the floor should apply to areas with a lower cost of living. A federal minimum-wage increase requires congressional approval.<br />“No matter where you work in America, if you work full time or 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty,” he said. “A $15 minimum wage accomplishes that.”</td>

It was the latest grisly discovery in a country beset by organized crime.<br />The 12 state police are being charged with homicide, abuse of authority and giving false information, Irving Barrios, the Tamaulipas attorney general, told a news conference.<br />The alleged involvement of so many police officers in the killing spotlights the continuing endemic corruption of Mexico’s local and state police forces.<br />The corruption in this case could also go higher. Mexico’s federal government said it was investigating why one of the vehicles where the migrants were found dead had been seized by federal migration officials in a raid in December.</td>

      <td>Investigators still don’t know how the company was breached in attack that will cost millions</td>
      <td>The newly appointed chief executive of  SolarWinds Corp.  is still trying to unravel how his company became a primary vector for hackers in a massive attack revealed last year, but said evidence is emerging that they were lurking in the company’s Office 365 email system for months.<br />The hackers had accessed at least one of the company’s Office 365 accounts by December 2019, and then leapfrogged to other Office 365 accounts used by the company, Sudhakar Ramakrishna said in an interview Tuesday. “Some email accounts were compromised. That led them to compromise other email accounts and as a result our broader [Office] 365 environment was compromised,” he said.<br />It is the latest development in the eight-week investigation into one of the worst breaches in U.S. history. SolarWinds, previously a little-known but critical maker of network-management software, is still trying to understand how the hackers first got into the company’s network and when exactly that happened.<br />One possibility is that the hackers may have compromised the company’s Office 365 accounts even earlier and then used that as the initial point of entry into the company, although that is one of several theories being pursued, Mr. Ramakrishna said.<br />Investigators are trying to determine how widespread the damage has been. So far only several dozen victims have been identified, but the attack could have ultimately affected close to 18,000 of the company’s customers.</td>

The drugmaker said its insurance companies have either disputed or declined to fully comply with their coverage obligations related to opioid-related litigation brought against Purdue.<br />The actual amount of insurance proceeds Purdue may wind up recovering will be determined in court, and claims made in the lawsuit will likely be challenged by the insurance companies. The lawsuit names several insurance companies, among them AIG Specialty Insurance Co. and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.<br />Purdue filed for chapter 11 protection in September 2019, with some support for a deal with creditors including states and municipalities to resolve claims for damages due to OxyContin’s alleged role in driving a nationwide epidemic of addiction that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.</td>

      <td>Party leaders grapple with controversies over Marjorie Taylor Greene, Liz Cheney</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The top two Republicans in Congress are charting different courses after former President Donald Trump lost the White House but not his grip on much of the party.<br />Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has distanced himself from Mr. Trump and taken aim at what he sees as the GOP’s extremist fringe, while House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has shored up his ties to the former president and urged members of his roiled caucus to stop attacking each other. Traditionally in lockstep, the leaders have rarely exposed such distance in their political calculations, as they contend with different intraparty divides on each side of the Capitol.<br />“Every party that loses the White House does a lot of blaming, finger-pointing and disarray, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said GOP strategist Terry Sullivan.<br />The debate centers on the direction of the party in the post-Trump era and the types of politicians it is willing to accept in its ranks, as it seeks to broaden its appeal in the electorate while not alienating voters loyal to Mr. Trump. The debate will continue Wednesday when the fate of two House members is expected to flare up at a House GOP meeting.<br />Mr. McConnell, who warned that disputing President Biden’s electoral victories could undermine democracy, hasn’t spoken with Mr. Trump since Dec. 15, the day after the Electoral College met. The Kentucky Republican harshly criticized Mr. Trump for his actions on the day of the Capitol riot, which led to his impeachment. He hasn’t yet said how he will vote in Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial, although he reiterated Tuesday that he has concerns over its constitutionality now that Mr. Trump is no longer in office.</td>

      <td>Books can help calm and transport you from pandemic stress. But many of us are finding it harder to read now. Here’s how—and why—to get back to it.</td>
      <td>This past year, I’ve found myself returning again and again to a line of poetry by Emily Dickinson: “There is no frigate like a book.”<br />Like many people, I’ve needed the therapeutic effects of reading more than ever this year. As neuroscientists and psychologists (and your high school English teacher) will tell you: Books are good for the brain. And their benefits are particularly vital now. Books expand our world, providing an escape and offering novelty, surprise and excitement, which boost dopamine. They broaden our perspective and help us empathize with others. And they can improve our social life, giving us something to connect over.<br />Books can also distract us and help reduce our mental chatter. When we hit that glorious “flow state” of reading where we’re fully immersed in a book, our brain’s default mode network likely calms down, says Jud Brewer, a psychiatrist who directs research at Brown University’s Mindfulness Center. That’s a network of brain regions that is active when we are not doing anything else and that can get absorbed in worrying and rumination.<br />“There’s so much noise in the world right now and the very act of reading is a kind of meditation,” says Mitchell Kaplan, owner of the Miami-based independent bookstores Books & Books and co-founder of the Miami Book Fair. “You disconnect from the chaos around you. You reconnect with yourself when you are reading. And there’s no more noise.”<br />In 2020, the NPD Group recorded the best year of book sales since it began tracking comparable data in 2004. Sales of print books, which make up 80% of the market, were up 8.2% by volume over 2019, while sales of e-books were up 17%. The sales were driven by a number of categories, according to NPD book analyst Kristen McLean: children’s books; adult nonfiction, especially books about race and civil rights; and biography and memoir.</td>

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the bill less than two hours later.<br />The existing law made it a violation for someone to remain or wander in a public place, beckoning or stopping people or vehicles for the purpose of prostitution. The number of people primarily charged with the offense has declined in the past 10 years to six in 2020 from 882 in 2010, according to the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services.<br />Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz, a Democrat from Queens, said she has transgender friends who were stopped by police “because of how they look and because they fit a certain profile.” She said she had been detained by police three times while walking in her home borough late at night, under suspicion of engaging in prostitution.</td>

That makes its deliberations Wednesday over two of its Members an important message about the party’s potential return to power.<br />A few dozen backbenchers want to depose Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney from the House leadership for voting to impeach Donald Trump. Other Members are concerned about the high public profile of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a freshman Member from Georgia with kooky views. If the House GOP punishes Ms. Cheney while saying nothing about Ms. Greene, it will deserve a longer time in the wilderness.<br />Ms. Cheney’s impeachment decision was a vote of conscience, as GOP leaders said at the time. She joined nine others in voting to impeach Mr. Trump after an assault on the Capitol that followed weeks of false election claims from the White House. Some Republicans say Ms. Cheney has special obligations to reflect the GOP conference as a leader, but GOP leaders didn’t whip the vote and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was offering little guidance.<br />Ms. Cheney should get credit for daring to stand alone despite the political risks. The Trumpians are vowing to defeat her in a primary in 2022, and Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Trump acolyte, flew to a rally in Cheyenne last week to stir up opposition. Donald Trump Jr. called into the rally to promote a primary challenge to her in 2022.<br />If bowing before all things Trump is the litmus test for being a loyal Republican, the party should get used to continued losses in the suburbs. Mr. McCarthy should be defending his colleague’s vote as a matter of principle, even if he disagreed with it, rather than living in fear of the wrath of Mar-a-Lago.</td>

Well, the science says schools can safely reopen, but the White House is still listening, make that bowing, to the non-scientists who run the teachers unions.<br />Mr. Biden has set a goal of reopening schools in his first 100 days, and the current union standoff in Chicago is his first big test. Elementary and middle school teachers there have refused to show up to classrooms as ordered. So the district has postponed reopening schools for two days. “We are practically begging [Chicago Teachers Union] to come to the table so we can get a deal done,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said.<br />No kidding. The district has surrendered to most union demands, which include allowing 5,000 or so employees to work from home because they have underlying health conditions. It has also spent $100 million on personal protective equipment, disinfectants, ventilation improvements, and portable air purifiers, and it will provide regular testing and contact tracing.<br />Yet now the union wants the district to let other staff work remotely if they wish and vaccinate teachers before they return to classrooms. If Chicago agrees to that, other unions would howl.<br />Ms. Lightfoot has been far too accommodating to the union, though she deserves credit for pushing at last to resume in-person learning. Large school districts in California including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Fresno have surrendered and are resisting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s exhortations to reopen.</td>

The charges of violating his parole from a previous conviction are a farce. This is a political arrest and sentence.<br />One lesson is that Mr. Putin and his gang must feel threatened. Protests in support of Mr. Navalny have been growing in major Russian cities. Mr. Putin has survived protests before, notably in 2012, but his popularity has sagged amid an economy weakened by lower oil prices and Western sanctions.<br />“[Putin’s] only method is killing people,” Mr. Navalny said in court. “For as much as he pretends to be a great geopolitician, he’ll go down in history as a poisoner.”<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a strong statement urging the Kremlin to “immediately and unconditionally release” Mr. Navalny and others arrested during the recent protests.

      <td>Amazon CEO’s transition comes following stellar performance—and ahead of big challenges</td>
      <td>There was never going to be an ideal time for Jeff Bezos to go. But now is probably as good as it is going to get.<br />“Go” is a relative term.  Amazon.com  took pains on Tuesday to point out that its famous founder isn’t really leaving. The company used the occasion of its fourth-quarter report to announce that Mr. Bezos is handing over the chief executive reins to Andy Jassy—a longtime lieutenant who has been running the company’s AWS cloud business since its inception. Mr. Bezos will become executive chair of the company, with the transition taking place in the third quarter of this year.<br />Still, it is a big move. Even in a tech industry that accords founders near mythic status, Mr. Bezos was in a world of his own.  Facebook  is the only other of the big tech giants still being actively managed by its founder, and Mr. Bezos was already a decade into his job when Mark Zuckerberg came up with the idea of the social network in his Harvard dorm. With 2020 revenue totaling about $386 billion, Amazon is also now more than four times the size of Facebook by that metric, and much larger than Apple,  Microsoft  or Google ever got under the management of their respective founders.<br />Still, a transition someday was inevitable—especially for a 57-year-old billionaire who likes to dabble in rockets, newspapers and life sciences. There likely won’t be a better time: Amazon just wrapped a year where its already strong businesses were boosted by the pandemic, which fueled both online shopping and demand for cloud-computing services. Fourth-quarter revenue and operating earnings blew past Wall Street’s estimates. Full-year sales surged 38%—the company’s best growth rate since 2011, when annual sales were about one-eighth their current level.<br />At the same time, the company faces an unprecedented number of challenges, especially as lawmakers and regulators crack down on big tech. Amazon is also unique among its big tech peers in that front-line workers make up such a big portion of its employee base, which now numbers nearly 1.3 million. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, told reporters Tuesday that Mr. Bezos will remain “very involved”—especially on so-called “one-way door decisions” that are difficult to undo. That helped Amazon’s share price recover in after-hours trading, following an initial drop on the news. Even for a company seeming to fire on all cylinders, investors don’t seem ready to let Jeff Bezos blast off quite yet.</td>

      <td>Disposable real per capita income rose 5.5% in 2020, the highest rate since 1984, due largely to transfer payments.</td>
      <td>Even among economists who strongly support President Biden, a consensus is growing that the economy emerged from last year set for a robust recovery. That view has been espoused by Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Barack Obama’s former top economist Jason Furman. Both have expressed concern that the economy may overheat.<br />The most encouraging sign that recovery will be strong as the vaccines take hold is not that real gross domestic product rose 7.5% in the third quarter, offsetting 83% of the economic collapse produced by the shutdown in the preceding quarter. Nor is it that 16 million of the 22 million jobs lost have been restored. The most encouraging sign is how much the total purchasing power of American families has expanded during the crisis, reaching record highs.<br />To be sure, many Americans have taken a serious hit: Commerce Department data show total employee compensation in the second and third quarters of 2020 was down by $215 billion compared with the first quarter. Yet government personal transfers were up $893 billion—four times the compensation lost. In the second quarter alone, real per capita disposable income was up 10.5% compared with the first quarter—25 times as fast as the average quarterly income growth in the prior two years.<br />This surge in personal income was driven by government stimulus equal to $2.6 trillion, more than all the private wages and salaries paid in the first quarter of 2020. While preliminary fourth-quarter figures show that personal income declined from the previous quarter, real per capita disposable income in 2020 grew 5.5%—the highest growth rate since 1984, the peak of the Reagan recovery. All of this occurred before the $900 billion December stimulus took effect.<br />So what happened to all that money? As transfer payments surged in the second quarter and the shutdown curtailed personal-consumption expenditures, pent-up purchasing power spiked. Quarterly savings rose by almost $800 billion. The historical savings rate of 7% to 8% of income reached an astonishing 26% in the second quarter. Preliminary data for 2020 show total savings for 2020 was $1.6 trillion higher than in 2019. And that was before the $900 billion stimulus.</td>

      <td>The left wants a spoils system on steroids. If the president gives it to them, heaven help us.</td>
      <td>President Biden likes to talk about “healing” and “unity,” but he also keeps pledging to prioritize the supposed interests of certain favored minority groups. When is he going to realize that his goals of racial unification and racial favoritism are at cross-purposes?<br />Last week Mr. Biden signed an executive order on “racial equity.” He said that George Floyd’s death last summer “marked a turning point in this country’s attitude toward racial justice” and is “forcing us to confront systemic racism and white supremacy.” He added that “this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equity” and make it “not just an issue for any one department. It has to be the business of the whole government.”<br />Nothing quickens the pulse of progressives like talk of “systemic racism” and “white supremacy,” so it’s hard to know if Mr. Biden is just telling leftists what they want to hear. But if it’s more than that—if the president is serious about focusing on equal outcomes instead of equal opportunities—then heaven help us. Milton Friedman said the “society that puts equality before freedom will end up with neither,” while “the society that puts freedom before equality will end up with a great measure of both.” Of course, Friedman had a constrained view of the government’s capabilities that isn’t shared by very many Democrats today. For them, good intentions are what matter most.<br />The political left has long used racism as an all-purpose explanation for racial disparities. This ignores that disparities down through history have been the norm, not the exception, and that they exist even in regions of the world where most people are of the same race. The per capita income gap between people in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, for example, is wider than the gap between whites and blacks in the U.S. Moreover, racial disparities have both grown and narrowed over time, even though racism has been constant. If Mr. Biden wants to change the government’s approach to racial inequality, this history ought to inform his actions.<br />The greatest success of the civil-rights movement wasn’t a new government program but getting government off the backs of blacks by defeating Jim Crow. Nothing the government has done since then in the name of advancing blacks has been more effective than simply ending government-sponsored discrimination. Black poverty fell by 40 percentage points between 1940 and 1960. It continued to decline in the wake of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society interventions, but at a much slower pace.</td>

      <td>IMF ‘special drawing rights’ with no strings are the wrong way to help developing countries.</td>
      <td>Sometimes an idea gets legs in Washington that is so objectively bad, you’re almost tempted to admire it simply for beating the odds. Such is the case with left-wing claims that the International Monetary Fund must shower money on developing economies to beat Covid-19. Congressional Democrats have pushed repeatedly for time-sensitive “must pass” legislation to require the IMF to issue at least two trillion special drawing rights, or SDRs, to its 190 member countries, which governments could then exchange for nearly $3 trillion in hard currency to defend against the pandemic.<br />This isn’t what SDRs are for, and it’s almost certainly not how they would be used if Democrats in Congress got their wish. Under the IMF’s longstanding rules, SDRs are supposed to meet a “long-term global need” in reserves; they aren’t meant to arm countries for short-term spending emergencies.<br />Nor would that be feasible: There are no strings attached to how a government uses SDRs, and they never have to be repaid. Donor countries may want recipient states to focus on acquiring personal protective equipment, vaccines and the like, but the IMF and World Bank already have programs directing money to areas where it’s needed most. A blank check would surrender accountability for how the money is used, inviting waste and corruption.<br />Another likely scenario is that SDRs would eventually go to pay debts to the Chinese government, as well as to private creditors who piled into risky debt before the coronavirus emerged. As the foremost creditor to the developing world, Beijing has fought multilateral agreements to suspend poor nations’ debt repayments during the pandemic, only yielding in small ways. China has also resisted pressure from the U.S. and allies for greater transparency on its predatory lending terms. Lavishing SDRs on developing-world borrowers would make restructuring or forgiveness of Chinese government loans less likely, giving Beijing the green light to proceed with business as usual in a post-pandemic world. No wonder Yi Gang, governor of China’s central bank, has championed the cause of issuing more SDRs from the IMF.<br />It gets worse. Since the IMF must allocate SDRs to countries according to their shareholding weight in the organization, the neediest would be the least able to benefit. A rich IMF member like the Netherlands would receive more than three times as much as Nigeria. Or consider that New Zealand, despite having virtually eliminated Covid-19 on its shores, would be entitled to more SDRs than Congo. The fine citizens of Luxembourg, population 600,000, would get more than the 163 million Bangladeshis. The perverse examples go on and on.</td>

      <td>Robinhood might remind its customers that stocks are about something real.</td>
      <td>With the  GameStop  bubble coming to its foreordained conclusion on Tuesday the broader stock market was having its best day in a while. Internet progress is sometimes measured in pratfalls. The stumble of the free online brokerage Robinhood over its customers’ trading of GameStop actually hearkens to a precedent that has nothing to do with the Wall Street vs. little guy narrative that preoccupies some.<br />In 1996, dial-up internet pioneer America Online stopped charging by the hour in favor of a flat monthly fee. Unsurprisingly, customers instantly revealed a preference for being online all the time. But a symphony of busy signals exposed an unappreciated fact of AOL’s business model: It was reselling access to the regulated local phone system designed for calls that last six minutes, not all week.<br />Robinhood could give small-timers free brokerage because it was selling their order flow, and thus information about which stocks were in demand, to other intermediaries. This model worked until its customers drove GameStop to unrealistic heights for reasons of their own. Then a behind-the-scenes plumbing provider, Robinhood’s clearing agent, spoke up. It would not accept the risk of the brokerage or its customers failing to deliver the cash if prices collapsed during the hours or days before trades cleared. It demanded Robinhood put up collateral it didn’t have. So Robinhood curtailed its customers to buying just a single share of GameStop.<br />Boom. Suddenly conspiracy theories flowed about Wall Street biggies intervening to stop a phenomenon that had harmed their own bets that GameStop would fall (known as short selling).<br />Like AOL’s, Robinhood’s snafu was partly due to ancient, clunky infrastructure—in this case for certifying ownership of an asset, such as a share of stock or even a person’s ownership of his or her own identity. (Blockchain is the answer many have proposed just as broadband solved the AOL problem.)</td>

      <td>There are so many diet programs to choose from—but do any of them work? One man’s try-anything search for a slimmer self.</td>
      <td>In the past two decades, one dimension of U.S. public health has undergone a shocking transformation: body weight. In 2000, the residents of West Virginia had an obesity rate of 23.9%, the highest of any U.S. state. By 2019, Colorado had nearly the same rate (23.8%), and it was the lowest of any state. Leaving aside a few small nations, the United States is the fattest country in the world, with an adult obesity rate exceeding 42%.<br />The disease and disability that accompany excess weight have contributed to higher health-care costs and lower life expectancy. They’ve also created a $72 billion industry devoted to telling people how to shed extra pounds. These combined conditions—reasons to worry and strategies to manage—set the stage for Barry Estabrook’s “Just Eat,” an enlightening first-person account focused on the diets that Americans attempt to follow and the cultures that seem to have found a healthy relationship with food.<br />Mr. Estabrook’s chronicle begins with his getting a physical—and admitting to himself that he is 40 pounds overweight. He is saddled with high cholesterol, so his doctor ups the dosage of a drug to treat it—to the maximum permissible level. But with high blood pressure, a family history of heart disease and a self-image as “lumpy,” Mr. Estabrook sees that something more is needed: He decides to go on the first diet of his life.<br />While his journalistic background includes food writing (he’s a former editor of Eating Well magazine), Mr. Estabrook poses as a dietary Everyman: no expert scientific or medical knowledge and no investment in any one regimen: “I had no horse in the race other than my rotund belly.” He believes that, if he can find a way of losing weight after an adulthood “defined by chubbiness and a spotty record in the willpower department,” then “anyone could.”<br />But he’s candid about the challenge he faces, citing studies showing that few people succeed by using diets to achieve long-term weight loss—and a lot of dieters end up adding weight. “In many ways,” he writes, “dieting is a multibillion-dollar scam.” Still, he gives it a try.</td>

      <td>The first full week of the post-Trump era wasn’t kind to CNN.</td>
      <td>No media outlets worked harder than CNN and MSNBC to promote Donald Trump’s quest for the Republican nomination for president in 2016. Their investment of massive airtime certainly paid off, as the Trump era turned out to be a golden age for political controversy and news-like programming.<br />Back in 2015, staff at the two networks were likely happy to enlist in the Trump promotion project because they figured he was the Republican most likely to lose to Hillary Clinton. Their candidate ended up losing in 2016 but they could take consolation in a clear commercial victory. The business of bashing Donald Trump, known as “resistance journalism” in the trade, has been both fun and profitable. Now what do they do?<br />In December this column asked whether the cable nets could hold their audiences by lauding Joe Biden. The early returns, based on the first full week of the Biden presidency, may be cause for concern.<br />Gavin Bridge reports on CNN for Variety:<br />The latest Trump impeachment drama starting next week with a Senate trial could be a sort of last hurrah for current programming strategies.</td>

      <td>Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.  said costs related to the coronavirus pandemic have dented profit even as online orders boost sales.<br />The burrito chain said Tuesday that earnings in its latest quarter were hurt as the pandemic worsened. Chipotle said it paid more in medical claims and performance-related bonuses to employees keeping its restaurants open during the health crisis.<br />The company, based in Newport Beach, Calif., reported earnings adjusted for one-time items of $3.48 a share for the fourth quarter, compared with $2.86 a share a year earlier. The latest results were short of the $3.73 a share that analysts expected. Sales of $1.6 billion hit expectations.<br />Shares in the chain fell nearly 2% to $1,495 in after-hours trading. “The pandemic has presented new challenges for all of us,” Chipotle Chief Executive Brian Niccol said to investors.<br />Labor has become a growing concern for companies as diverse as manufacturers and food producers during the pandemic. Some restaurant chains have said they expect labor costs to rise this year as they pay to hire and retain workers in public-facing roles. The Biden administration is also looking to boost the minimum wage, which would translate into higher wages for many restaurant chains.</td>
