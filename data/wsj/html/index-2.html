      <td>Second storm will prolong icy conditions for many already struggling with snow and extreme temperatures</td>
      <td>Millions of Americans remained without power for a third consecutive day, as another winter storm began blanketing parts of the South with more snow and freezing rain.<br />The new storm, which will move toward the East Coast later this week, will prolong icy conditions in some areas hit earlier this week by an Arctic blast of subzero temperatures and snow, according to the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center.<br />Predictions show snowfall of four inches and above from Oklahoma to the mid-Atlantic region, with Pennsylvania potentially seeing eight inches or more later this week. “Significant freezing rain is also likely from Texas to Tennessee and North Carolina to Virginia,” the weather service said on  Twitter ,  adding that parts of Texas, Mississippi and the Mid-Atlantic could accumulate swaths of ice a half-inch thick.<br />Hazardous weather will move into the Florida panhandle and the Carolinas on Thursday, including the possibility of tornadoes, the NWS warned. Ahead of the storm, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued a state of emergency, which will allow for quicker repairs to downed lines and other utility issues.<br />“This forecast for icy weather is a real threat for widespread power outages,” the Democrat said Wednesday. “People need to be ready to stay home and be prepared to lose power for a while.”</td>

      <td>After running as a moderate, he now promotes unlimited government spending.</td>
      <td>If any media folk are still interested in “fact-checking” presidents after the Trump era, they’ll have plenty of fodder from Tuesday night’s appearance by President Joe Biden on CNN. A favorite Biden habit is to appeal to the authority of economists, many of whom remain unnamed, to suggest that his policies are wildly popular among experts. And what would we do without anonymous experts?<br />Newsweek has a transcript of the event in which CNN’s Anderson Cooper hosted our 46th president at Milwaukee’s Pabst Theater. Here’s an excerpt:<br />Thank goodness this statement is not accurate. There is not an “overwhelming consensus” among economists that no amount of federal spending is excessive. This column is often skeptical of conventional expert opinion. But even for those who aren’t, the Biden economic plan is notable for the way it has drawn criticism not just from economists in the center and on the right but from Mr. Biden’s own former colleagues on the left. Many of the critiques specifically warn that he is indeed spending too much taxpayer money on a recovering economy which does not need another massive intervention.<br />Last month this column noted the criticism of Bidenomics from veterans of the Obama economic team. More recently one of the Biden plan’s enthusiastic backers also acknowledged the resistance coming from liberal economists. John Cassidy wrote in the New Yorker:<br />One can usually count on massive federal programs to be counterproductive, such as the one Mr. Biden helped oversee as Vice President in 2009 and which he reasonably described on Tuesday as “the last experiment we had with stimulus.” Unreasonably for taxpayers, the experiment failed as the plan burned through more than $800 billion and failed miserably to reach its employment goals.</td>

News Corp owns The Wall Street Journal and news organizations in the U.K. and Australia.<br />News Corp will also make new podcasts that will be available through Google’s voice-assistant technology and new videos for YouTube, the technology company’s video-streaming service. The audio and video content won’t be exclusive to Google, the person familiar with the matter said.<br />The agreement will have “a positive impact on journalism around the globe as we have firmly established that there should be a premium for premium journalism,” News Corp Chief Executive Officer Robert Thomson said in a statement.</td>

      <td>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday defended his handling of Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes and accused a Democratic state lawmaker of making false claims about his administration’s response.<br />During a news call, the Democratic governor singled out Assemblyman Ron Kim, who has been highly critical of the Cuomo administration for not fully releasing details of nursing-home deaths and has raised questions about the governor’s support for civil and criminal immunity for nursing-home operators. Mr. Kim also has said the Cuomo administration was engaged in a coverup related to nursing-home deaths.<br />“He attacked me and said that I obstructed justice in a letter today,” Mr. Cuomo said of Mr. Kim. “He said today that the immunity bill was because of my political contributors. Those are very harsh accusations.”<br />“If you don’t correct the disinformation, it perpetuates,” Mr. Cuomo added.<br />The governor has come under fire from Democratic and Republican leaders following the disclosure that his administration didn’t fully release information regarding Covid-19 deaths in the state’s nursing homes out of its fear that former President Trump’s administration would politicize the information. That concern prompted the Cuomo administration to withhold information from state lawmakers regarding how many nursing-home residents died from the virus after they were transferred to hospitals, citing the continuing probe by the U.S. Department of Justice.</td>

And vaccinating an entire town will counter Brazil’s growing anti-vax movement and demonstrate the wider benefits of mass immunization, such as a quick economic recovery expected with a fast reopening of Serrana.<br />“It will give us information about the percentage of people who need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity—no one knows this yet,” said Marcos Borges, a professor of medicine at the University of São Paulo in nearby Ribeirão Preto who is leading the study.</td>

      <td>Progressives want $15 an hour by 2025, but procedural questions and centrists’ doubts could force changes to piece of Covid-aid proposal</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats are bracing for an internal battle over raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, as they grappled with the political and procedural constraints on reaching a long-held goal of the party’s progressive wing.<br />Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan proposes to do by 2025, faces opposition from some Democratic lawmakers and parliamentary hurdles. Democrats cannot afford to lose a single vote in the 50-50 Senate on the relief package, which also calls for sending many Americans a $1,400 direct check, bolstering federal unemployment aid, and offering funds for vaccine distribution and testing.<br />At a CNN town hall event on Tuesday, Mr. Biden floated the possibility of raising the minimum wage to $12 or $13 an hour by 2025, rather than $15.  “I do support a $15 minimum wage,” Mr. Biden said. “But that’s a debatable issue.”<br />Press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday Mr. Biden continues to back the $15 wage but noted his aid proposal “included many other components.” She added that the legislation “may not look the same way when it comes out of the sausage-making machine” in Congress.<br />While many Republicans have assailed the proposed wage increase, arguing that it would hurt small businesses and cost jobs, Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Tuesday they would soon introduce their own legislation to raise the minimum wage. The two Republicans said they would pair the gradual wage increase with a requirement that employers verify the immigration status of their employees—likely a nonstarter with Democrats. The pair haven’t yet specified what level they would raise the wage.</td>

      <td>A familiar voice in American media and politics has gone quiet. Rush Limbaugh, the most listened-to radio host in America for 30 years, died Wednesday at age 70.<br />We recall how bracing the Rush Limbaugh Show was in its early days. For decades the airwaves had been governed by the Fairness Doctrine, a federal regulation requiring stations to balance “controversial” claims with “contrasting viewpoints.” The rule gave incumbent candidates and mainstream news outlets a near-monopoly on public discourse. Ronald Reagan scrapped the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. By the 1992 presidential campaign, the radio star’s first name was known across the U.S.<br />Limbaugh, whose show ran on weekdays from noon to 3 p.m. East Coast time, was invaluable to the conservative movement in the 1990s. He would spend an hour explaining supply-side tax policy or making the case for deregulation. Millions of Americans had never heard a coherent argument against the welfare state or Roe v. Wade until they tuned in to Limbaugh’s show. He played an enormous role in popularizing conservative ideas and policies.<br />His critics called him a racist and about everything else, which was always unfair. His real offense was to gain millions of weekly listeners by mocking the left’s pieties. He dissected environmental scare campaigns, and he ridiculed the news media for finding epidemics of homelessness only during Republican administrations. In 1994 Bill Clinton called the show from Air Force One to complain about the host’s criticisms—not for the last time blaming scrappy radio hosts for his own political woes.<br />In recent years, with the rise of more acerbic competitors and a general souring of public discourse, Limbaugh took on a more exasperated tone. He also moved to the Trumpian right on issues such as trade, immigration and foreign policy.</td>

      <td>Two longtime  Boeing Co.  directors are expected to step down as the aerospace giant’s board undergoes more changes in the wake of the 737 MAX crisis, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The Chicago-based plane maker is expected to announce the retirement of Susan Schwab and Arthur Collins, these people said.  The company isn’t expected to immediately nominate new directors to the board, one of these people said. The directors’ departure could be announced as soon as Wednesday, this person said.<br />Mr. Collins, former chief executive of medical device-maker  Medtronic PLC ,  has been a Boeing board member since 2007. Ms. Schwab, a former U.S. trade representative, has been on the board since 2010.<br />The departures have been under consideration in recent weeks and are part of a longer-term push to bring new directors onto the board in the aftermath of the MAX crisis, some of the people familiar with the matter said. Four members of the expected 10-member board will have been added after the accidents.<br />Boeing’s board has faced scrutiny from investors and U.S. lawmakers ever since two of its 737 MAX jets crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, claiming 346 lives. A year ago, the board added two new directors with safety and engineering experience as two longtime members stepped down. Since the accidents, Boeing’s board has also added a permanent safety committee and split the roles of chairman and chief executive.</td>

Facebook said that news accounts for “less than 4% of the content people see in their News Feed” but didn’t provide detail on how it had calculated that number.<br />Facebook, which has been threatening for months that the proposal could force its hand, said the Australian government continues to misunderstand the relationship between publishers and the company’s social-media platforms.<br />“It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,” the company said in a statement Wednesday from William Easton, Facebook’s managing director, for Australia and New Zealand.</td>

Taylor and his son Peter M. Taylor sent a letter early this month to Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking for a delay of 30 to 60 days for the new administration to take a look at whether the pair should be extradited, according to a copy of the letter viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The State Department has the final say in extradition cases, which are considered diplomatic matters. The Trump-era State Department had cleared the Taylors’ extradition. The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday declined to take up the case, marking the end of any legal appeals.<br />If U.S. officials decide to proceed with the extradition, the Taylors’ lawyers asked the State Department to put conditions on the surrender, including that the nine months the Taylors served in a U.S. jail count towards any prison sentence they might receive in Japan. The letter also requests that the Taylors serve any Japanese prison sentence in the U.S. or a U.S. military detention facility in Japan.<br />The Taylors at minimum have requested a delay in extradition until at least Feb. 25, the day after they are scheduled to receive their second Covid-19 vaccine, according to Paul V. Kelly, one of their attorneys. There is a Covid-19 outbreak at the Norfolk County jail near Boston where the Taylors have been held since U.S. authorities arrested them in May at the request of Japanese officials.</td>

      <td>Unusually cold Texas weather is both good and bad for oil refiners as margins get a boost, but some are unable to capitalize</td>
      <td>The massive oil-and-gas complex along the U.S. Gulf Coast is built with extreme weather in mind—just not this kind. Bitter cold and resulting blackouts have shut in more production and refining capacity than any recent hurricane, delivering a windfall for some companies with the right assets in the right place.<br />Oil prices usually fall when refiners shut down unexpectedly—they are, after all, the only customer—but both U.S. crude supply and demand are being pinched. The picture is more bullish for the fuels refiners churn out. More than 3 million barrels a day of crude oil production, or about 27% of the total, have been affected, according to Raymond James, while about 18% of refining capacity has been shut. Front-month gasoline futures hit their highest level since October 2018 on Wednesday.<br />The crack spread, the difference between gasoline prices and crude oil, was up 5.13%, according to Robert Yawger, energy futures analyst at Mizuho Securities. That means higher profits for refiners still up and running.<br />Independent refiners, so badly battered by the pandemic, have seen a bump. The biggest gainers include shares of  PBF Energy  and  CVR Energy ,  both up by about a fifth compared with a week ago. Around 82% of PBF Energy’s total refining capacity is outside the Gulf Coast area. Other refiners with mixed footprints, such as  HollyFrontier Corp.  and  Valero ,  also have seen gains.<br />It isn’t clear how long the windfall will last and what the net benefit will be. For those that had to shut off substantial Gulf Coast refining capacity, a longer shutdown could just erase temporary profits. Meanwhile, market forces are at work. Mr. Yawger notes that European buyers have been purchasing crude oil to refine and export it to the U.S. as fast as they can. U.S. gasoline imports rose 20% this week compared with a week earlier, according to S&P Global Platts.</td>

      <td>Justice Department charges North Koreans hackers in wide-ranging scheme that included attempts to steal $1.3 billion for Pyongyang</td>
      <td>North Korean hackers are increasingly focusing their criminal activity on the world of cryptocurrency and have recently built malicious cryptocurrency apps, launched ransomware attacks, and even promoted a fraudulent initial coin offering in pursuit of digital cash, the Justice Department said Wednesday.<br />Federal prosecutors provided the new details in a grand jury indictment returned in December and unsealed on Wednesday, charging two alleged members of North Korea’s military intelligence services, Jon Chang Hyok and Kim Il, with a wide-ranging scheme that included attempts to steal $1.3 billion over the past half-decade for Pyongyang.<br />A third man, Park Jin Hyok, who is also named in the indictment, was previously charged in a September 2018 case that accused him of playing a role in the 2016 theft of $81 million from Bangladesh’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, among other intrusions.<br />The hackers also allegedly sent spear phishing emails to employees at the State and Defense Departments and multiple U.S. technology companies in January and February 2020, the indictment said.<br />The charges chronicle a criminal moneymaking operation that has mirrored the general public’s increasing interest in digital currencies, as bitcoin has topped the $50,000 mark.</td>

Samsung expects to resume production as soon as possible and, the spokeswoman said, was waiting for electricity provider Austin Energy to advise when the chip maker’s operations could start up again.<br />Texas has suffered widespread power disruptions that began early Monday amid a severe winter storm. The outages have prompted local officials to ask companies to reduce operations to minimize demand on the region’s power grid.<br />The Austin facilities represent about 28% of Samsung’s overall production capacity, according to Citi analysts. Austin is a manufacturing hub for Samsung, which is considering a $17 billion plan to expand its operations there or in other parts of the U.S.<br />Dutch chip company  NXP Semiconductors  NV said Wednesday that it had to scale back work at two facilities in Austin. “Affected customers are being notified directly by NXP of the potential for supply disruptions,” the company said.</td>

      <td>Regarding your editorial “Reality Check for a $15 Minimum Wage” (Feb. 9): Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would greatly hurt the economy, and the young and underqualified will be the ones to suffer if this is enacted.<br />I have been employed by a nonprofit gymnastics association for the past five years (since I was 14). As a student instructor (until high-school graduation) I made $7.25 an hour. An organization like the one I work for employs mostly students ages 14-18. Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would result in a reduction of staff, so much so that the services we provide wouldn’t be able to adequately be performed, ultimately leading to the demise of the organization.<br />Many of the employment opportunities my college-student peers and I seek are part-time and require little to no experience. These opportunities will disappear if the minimum wage is increased to $15 per hour. With that in mind, it is likely that America will see a decrease in employment and increase in poverty among young adults and inexperienced workers.<br />For the sake of the small businesses and the young and inexperienced workers, the proposal of a $15 per hour minimum wage needs to be fought and ultimately rejected.<br />Leah Bookser</td>

Correct, except that my subject was only the decennial census. It has seven questions, two about race, occupying 40% of the form. No room for questions on income, citizenship, immigration, etc. Is it not reasonable to conclude that the government cares about race above other issues? This is not the message we want sent to the entire population, including groups angry that race statistics, writes the Census Bureau, provide “services of particular interest to certain racial and ethnic groups.” Nor is the decennial robust enough to keep up with the demographic transformation Mr. Alba documents.<br />Ending racial discrimination requires new policies based on new statistics. The American Community Survey (ACS) is the source. It is the bureau’s largest sample survey, collecting data on 3.5 million Americans each year, and asking a wide range of questions: health, place of birth, veteran status, internet use, etc. Areas with a few thousand people can be studied by combining five years. The ACS’s scope, frequency and granularity can understand discrimination in ways not possible with the decennial census, the target of my “quit counting race”statement. The nation needs the decennial for its constitutional responsibility, the basic count used to reapportion, and for its capacity to provide a denominator for a vast array of statistical agencies. For policies responding to the institutional racism still with us and to the assimilation now unfolding before us the nation needs measures designed for those conditions. This is beyond the reach of the decennial, but not the ACS.<br />Kenneth Prewitt<br />New York<br />Mr. Prewitt was Census Bureau director 1998-2001.</td>

The output rise won’t kick in until April, given the Saudis already have committed to stick to cuts through March.<br />The advisers cautioned the plans still could be reversed if circumstances change, and the Saudis’ intention hasn’t yet been communicated to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the people and OPEC delegates.<br />“We are in a much better place than we were a year ago, but I must warn, once again, against complacency,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the Saudi energy minister, said at a conference Wednesday. “The uncertainty is very high, and we have to be extremely cautious.”</td>

Consumer activists say the disparity potentially leaves homeowners underinsured where they thought they were covered.<br />Many homeowners will learn that policies are anything but standardized across the industry, said Daniel Schwarcz, a University of Minnesota Law School professor.<br />Policies are more varied than they were a decade or two ago, he said. While some differences might work to homeowners’ advantage, a substantial majority could hurt them. As one example, some policies cover the risk that a structure collapses due to the weight of ice or snow, whereas others don’t, he said. Some may cover food spoilage resulting from the loss of power, though others don’t.</td>

      <td>Rush Limbaugh, conservative talk-radio icon and pioneer of a thriving right-wing media industry, died Wednesday of complications from lung cancer, his wife, Kathryn Rogers, announced on his show. He was 70 years old.<br />Mr. Limbaugh told listeners he was undergoing treatment for advanced lung cancer in early 2020. He said later that year that the cancer was stage 4, terminal and progressing after months of several different treatment regimens. At the time he reiterated his intent to continue with his show, despite fatigue and other symptoms.<br />Ms. Rogers on Wednesday said Mr. Limbaugh had “proudly fought and defended conservative values in a way that no one else can. Rush often stood up and took arrows on his own because he knew it was the right thing to do.”<br />Beginning as a relatively unknown disc jockey at stations in Pennsylvania and Missouri, Mr. Limbaugh saw his star rise quickly after starting a talk show in 1984 in Sacramento, Calif., where he began espousing conservative political ideas during the Republican revolution of the Reagan era. In 1988 he began a new show at WABC-AM in New York that was syndicated nationally on AM and FM stations.<br />“The Rush Limbaugh Show,” marked by his signature brash and acerbic conservatism, was the most-listened-to radio talk show in the U.S., according to Nielsen Audio, reaching more than 20 million monthly listeners on more than 650 affiliates as of the end of 2020.</td>

      <td>The truth is coming out about Cuomo’s disastrous policy. Families like mine demand accountability.</td>
      <td>My mother, Joan Morris, died of Covid-19, which she contracted at a Brooklyn, N.Y., nursing home. She arrived there Jan. 24, 2020. She came down with Covid symptoms the week of April 5. She was sent to the hospital on April 10, was diagnosed with Covid on April 11, and died on April 17.<br />Last month the state acknowledged that 12,743 people died of Covid contracted in nursing homes because they were inexplicably put in harm’s way by the admission of new residents who were Covid-positive.<br />My mother’s death was entirely preventable. She had a treatable ailment (a broken vertebra) along with a pre-existing condition (advanced emphysema), and she would be alive today but for Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive order that forced nursing homes to accept Covid patients—which he issued despite the availability of thousands of beds in the empty Javits Convention Center, the largely unused Central Park field hospital, and the underused federal hospital ship USNS Comfort, which was stationed in New York for all of April. According to media reports, Mr. Cuomo and Health Commissioner Howard Zucker then undercounted, concealed and suppressed the nursing-home death toll.<br />My mother shouldn’t be a mere statistic on a dubious government chart. Unless there is meaningful accountability, the people Mr. Cuomo once called the most “precious” in our community will have died in vain. Families deserve to know the truth. State and federal prosecutors should open an investigation to determine if Mr. Cuomo’s executive response to Covid-19 was criminally negligent or a violation of laws against elder abuse.<br />Certainly it was an unprecedented public-policy disaster. Instead of owning its errors of judgment, the Cuomo administration pushed the Legislature to pass a measure shielding nursing homes from civil liability. This was a de facto grant of immunity for Mr. Cuomo’s policy decision, as lawsuits would have revealed the real numbers. The immunity was scaled back with another law in August, but it should be reversed entirely.</td>

The party that abolished slavery, won the right to vote for women, and beat Soviet communism must continue to be strong and principled to move America forward.<br />But the liberal media doesn’t care about that. It wants to stoke a nonstop Republican civil war. The media playbook starts with the demand that everyone pick sides about Donald Trump—either love or hate everything about him. The moment anyone on the right offers the slightest criticism of the 45th president, the media goes berserk: Republicans are trying to have it both ways! It’s a calculated strategy to pit conservatives against one another. It’s also a ridiculous false choice. Real life is never that simple. Someone can do both good and bad things.<br />People feel strongly about Mr. Trump, but we can acknowledge reality. People on the left, if they’re honest, can find Trump accomplishments they like—a coronavirus vaccine in record time, Middle East peace, more accountability from China. People on the right can find fault with Trump actions, including on Jan. 6. Right or left, when people make these distinctions, they’re not trying to have it both ways. They’re using their brains.<br />Just as important, they’re proving people are more than their party affiliations. If we can’t make judgments beyond whether someone is Republican or Democrat, then America can’t face its biggest challenges. We separate into two camps that always hate each other. We become estranged from family and friends over politics.<br />Is that really what the anti-Trump media wants? Maybe. Hatred and polarization draw attention, ratings and clicks. But what’s good for them is bad for America. Some Never Trump and Always Trump Republicans also attack anyone who doesn’t join the all-or-nothing chorus. That’s not how I saw Mr. Trump conduct himself when I worked with him in the White House, where he engaged in internal debates, welcomed disagreements, and at times changed his mind.</td>

But is it worth devoting precious kitchen space to these devices—some as compact as a toaster, others as large as a bookshelf?

In the second quarter of 2020, revenue at  AeroGrow International ,  the parent company behind the AeroGarden brand of hydroponics, was up 245% year over year.<br />Unlike temperamental backyard plots, however, these planters promise to function as obediently as Keurigs. Simply pop in a few pods filled with seeds and growth medium, fill a water reservoir, hit a button and wait. The devices nourish, say, basil sprouts with a regulated supply of moisture and fertilizer while a canopy of sunlight-replicating LED lights shines down.

That would translate to between 167,000 and 225,000 jobs lost.<br />Similarly, an end to U.S. semiconductor sales to China would cost the industry $83 billion in revenue and 124,000 jobs, according to the report entitled “Understanding U.S.-China Decoupling.”<br />The scenarios laid out in the 88-page report envision a complete end to sales between the two intertwined economic superpowers—the kind of outcome that is only likely to happen in an all-out war.<br />Still, the Chamber argues, it is important to contemplate extreme cases as a way to focus policy makers on the costs involved in battling China.</td>

Both would slash the number of children in poverty by around 3 million, or a third, according to the Niskanen Center, a center-right think tank.<br />In the process, it may also become the only major benefit in the U.S. that achieves near universality—testing traditional American notions of the safety net. “It would be a huge change in how we think about delivering benefits,” said Elaine Maag, principal research associate at the Urban Institute.<br />Federal benefits usually require the recipient to meet some criterion of need: poor (for food stamps, welfare and Medicaid), unemployed (for unemployment insurance), working or looking for work (the earned-income tax credit and some programs with work requirements), or disabled (Social Security Disability Insurance). Only Social Security and Medicare approach universality: Almost all elderly are eligible.</td>

      <td>Sales at the Italian brand have slipped further behind rival labels Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior in recent months</td>
      <td>During the pandemic, investors sought safety in a handful of top luxury stocks. Gucci’s owner  Kering  hasn’t made the cut despite its natural advantages.<br />On Wednesday the Paris-listed luxury company that also owns fashion labels Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta said sales in the three months through December fell 4.8% at constant exchange rates compared with the same period of 2019. Its most important cash cow, Gucci, reported a disappointing 10% drop in revenue. The worse-than-expected numbers sent Kering’s shares down 8% in early European trading.<br />Gucci had a much weaker fourth quarter than comparable brands at rival LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division, home to Louis Vuitton and  Christian Dior ,  increased sales by 18% in the fourth quarter. It isn’t just a recent phenomenon: Gucci hasn’t kept pace with LVMH’s fashion brands since early 2019 according to analysis by Bernstein. The pandemic is worsening the divide, though.<br />Gucci should have a competitive edge right now. Its owner has deep pockets to invest heavily in e-commerce, digital marketing and to expand in Asia where demand from Chinese consumers has rebounded quickly. That scale isn’t translating into clear market-share gains.<br />Kering has become too reliant on one brand—a problem investors have been pointing out for several years. Gucci generated 83% of group operating profit in 2019. While that level of exposure was a boon for shareholders in the early days of the label’s successful turnaround that kicked off around five years ago, performance is lagging now that the revamp appears to be running out of steam.</td>

That is the question investors in cloud commerce platform  Shopify  must ask themselves as post-pandemic bricks-and-mortar shopping promises to return.<br />Analysts are clearly still scratching their heads. While the majority of them were neutral on the stock last May, shares have nearly doubled since then, putting many of their predictions to shame. Shopify appears to be one of Wall Street’s more controversial names, with roughly half its analysts now recommending the stock and half still on the sidelines.<br />The divide is illustrative of the broader controversy for post-pandemic investing: When a company enjoys a massive pull-forward in usage, just how much can it continue to grow?<br />One thing is for certain: 2020 was an epic win for Shopify. On Wednesday, it posted results showing sales grew by more than 90% year over year for the third consecutive quarter. Merchant sales on its platform were up nearly 76% amid the Black Friday/Cyber Monday period alone. Shopify, a company that 12 months ago many outside of the retail industry had never even heard of, now boasts a stratospheric market value of over $186 billion.<br />The company said Wednesday it expects revenue in 2021 to grow rapidly, but moderate from the 2020 pace as some level of bricks-and-mortar shopping returns.

      <td>SYDNEY—The new chief executive officer of  Rio Tinto  PLC wants to change a risk-averse culture at the world’s second-largest mining company that could see it pursue commodities vital to the energy transition more aggressively.<br />Jakob Stausholm said mining companies had become too cautious after overpaying for deals around a decade ago during a rush to feed China with metals and minerals vital to its industrialization, which left them vulnerable to hefty asset write-downs when commodity prices fell.<br />Facing an investor backlash at the time, companies including Rio Tinto moved to prioritize dividends to shareholders and buying back shares over deals or investments in new mines that could turn sour.<br />Rio Tinto’s annual result on Wednesday continued that trend. A 22% rise in net profit to $9.77 billion paved the way for a record final dividend and a special dividend in what was Mr. Stausholm’s first earnings update since succeeding Jean-Sébastien Jacques as CEO on Jan. 1. Mr. Jacques was ousted last year amid the fallout from the destruction of ancient rock shelters in a remote part of Australia.<br />Rio Tinto’s increased profit was driven by a rally in iron-ore prices to a nine-year high. Iron ore is used to make steel and has been one of the hottest commodities as China bets on infrastructure, such as new highways and apartment construction, to drive its economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.</td>

That followed results from a small clinical trial in South Africa that found the AstraZeneca vaccine didn’t appear to protect recipients from developing mild or moderate illness from the fast-spreading new strain of the coronavirus first detected in the country.<br />The J&J vaccine was found to be 57% effective at preventing moderate and severe Covid-19 symptoms in a larger trial held in South Africa, including from the B.1.351 variant, which has become the predominant version there. That was lower than the 72% efficacy rate observed during J&J’s trial in the U.K., which vaccine experts attributed to the South African variant’s ability to partially escape the immune response triggered by some Covid-19 vaccines.<br />When looking at just severe Covid-19 cases, the J&J vaccine was found to be 85% effective, including in South Africa.<br /></td>

      <td>Competition between payment firms including PayPal and Affirm is intensifying, but the territory they are vying for is huge and diverse</td>
      <td>Several financial technology firms are eager to grow in the expanding realm of “buy now, pay later” lending. There likely is room enough in this town for everyone, at least for now.<br />Last week, one company that just went public in January, Affirm Holdings, and another established digital giant,  PayPal Holdings ,  discussed how they plan to win in this emerging lending category of short-term credit for shopping purchases. Both have plenty to be excited about:  PayPal  launched its Pay in 4 product last year, and already generated $750 million in volume in the fourth quarter. Affirm grew volume 41% quarter over quarter in the last three months of 2020 and said it has logged promising results in beta tests of its major new partnership with rapidly growing Shopify.<br />The fact is that buy now pay later, or BNPL, is a somewhat loosely defined thing. Some digital purchase installment loans are for just a few weeks; others can be for years. Some are for small-dollar purchases of ephemera, others for expensive durable goods. And while BNPL payment volumes are growing rapidly—by more than 50% among four big providers through the first nine months of 2020, according to Autonomous Research—they collectively represent just a couple percentage points of global e-commerce spending, which is itself growing rapidly. That leaves plenty of volume to fight over between these firms, as well as others such as  Afterpay  and Klarna and established card companies and banks that evolve their products to mimic BNPL in some respects.<br />Even if there is plenty of consumer demand and transaction opportunity, competition can still bite by pushing down what merchants are willing to pay the loan providers. Still, there are many models. Merchants may pay little for smaller, shorter-term, lower risk installments. But they may pay more when the lender is willing to take on more duration and credit risk to help customers who wouldn’t otherwise make a purchase. Firms that can regularly deliver those kinds of buyers, especially via their own networks, would have the most defensible fees.<br />For a relatively newer company like Affirm, a small number of major deals for prominent placement, particularly with marketplaces such as Shopify, have the potential to power big growth. Meanwhile PayPal has close to 30 million merchants on its platform and integrates Pay in 4 into its existing checkout button and pricing, so it has vast room to grow. BNPL also is just one of a growing list of features for what PayPal terms its evolving consumer “super app,” like discounts, pay-with-rewards, crypto, bill payments and more. It is the firms that hold on to consumers and win other business from them that may emerge the biggest winners.</td>

      <td>Vaccines and therapeutics for Covid-19 have been an unexpected windfall for the drug industry, but Wall Street is less enthusiastic about cash windfalls</td>
      <td>For big pharma, a fresh $15 billion in sales just isn’t what it used to be.<br />Vaccines and therapeutics for Covid-19 have been an unexpected windfall for the drug industry, and there is more where that came from as the pandemic drags on.  Pfizer  said earlier this month that it expects to book $15 billion in sales from its Covid-19 vaccine in 2021. To put that figure in context, it is roughly equivalent to Pfizer’s entire oncology and immunology revenue in 2020. Pfizer’s total top line was just under $42 billion in 2020. What is more, that vaccine sales forecast is very conservative, as it only includes sales from doses from existing contracts with governments. Meanwhile,  Gilead Sciences  announced that it expects to sell between $2 billion and $3 billion of its antiviral drug remdesivir in 2021. It booked $2.8 billion in sales of the drug in 2020, most of it in the fourth quarter.<br />You wouldn’t think the pandemic was generating unexpected revenue by looking at those companies’ share prices. Both Pfizer and Gilead are down about 20% from their pandemic-era highs, and both stocks peaked as their drugs approached the market. That performance stands in marked contrast to smaller vaccine developers such as  BioNTech ,   Moderna  and  Novavax .<br />There are some valid reasons for that underperformance. Wall Street tends to place a low value on blockbuster drug sales if that drug faces a short shelf life, often because of an expiring patent or the expected approval of a superior medication. Those concerns are only amplified in a public health emergency since the pandemic’s ultimate duration is uncertain.<br />Even if annual booster shots become the standard in Covid-19 vaccination, as some drug executives and health officials have predicted, the onset of new competition likely means a tougher pricing environment in the future. After all, the flu shot is given annually but isn’t an especially lucrative product for the drug industry. And governments will be far more inclined to drive a hard bargain for future orders once the crisis abates.</td>

He added, “I would die for her,” in a video he posted to  Facebook  last month.<br />After being reported by people who witnessed the vaccination, he was targeted by prosecutors for criminal charges for demanding advantage as a public official, resigned and agreed to pay a $9,000 fine.<br />Brazil is only a month into its vaccination campaign against Covid-19, yet the country’s authorities have already been overwhelmed by several thousands of reports of people who circumvented the rules to get immunized before the most vulnerable.<br />Among those under investigation are politicians, influential business owners and lawyers, along with a host of other professionals, from veterinarians to fashion bloggers, most of whom incriminated themselves after posting vaccination selfies to social media, prosecutors said.

He was arrested last year after disappearing during a visit to Dubai airport, before being paraded in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, in handcuffs. Mr. Kagame, who says Mr. Rusesabagina is a fugitive responsible for funding terrorism, denied he had been kidnapped but called the operation flawless.<br />The trial—which has been widely condemned by human-rights groups, members of U.S. Congress and the European Parliament, among others—is being seen as a signal that Rwanda’s government is prepared to reach far beyond its borders to squash dissent.<br />Mr. Kagame, in power for 20 years, has won plaudits for reducing poverty, attracting foreign capital from aid agencies and private investors, and winning support from Western leaders including Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.</td>

      <td>North Korea’s first lady had been absent from state media since early 2020</td>
      <td>SEOUL—Kim Jong Un’s wife made her first public appearance in more than a year when she attended a concert celebrating one of North Korea’s major holidays.<br />Ri Sol Ju, who is believed to be in her early 30s, had been absent from state media since Jan. 25, 2020, when she was photographed at a Lunar New Year’s Day theater performance. Ms. Ri’s public absence fueled speculation that she could be pregnant, ill, caring for a sick relative or purged.<br />South Korea’s spy agency this week told lawmakers Ms. Ri’s low profile could be due to concerns about Covid-19.<br />But at the Tuesday concert, North Korea’s first lady was shown smiling and without a face mask, sitting next to Mr. Kim in a crowded Pyongyang theater. She watched a song-and-dance performance honoring the birthday of Kim Jong Il, the current leader’s late father, during the country’s “Day of the Shining Star” holiday.<br />Ms. Ri, first mentioned as Kim Jong Un’s wife in 2012, initially appeared often in state media, a move that Pyongyang watchers said was aimed at humanizing the fresh-faced dictator. In 2018, she traveled to Beijing when her husband met Chinese leader Xi Jinping, then later played host during other state visits to Pyongyang by foreign leaders like South Korean President Moon Jae-in.</td>

      <td>Australian politicians want digital platforms to pay media companies more for their content. Regulators world-wide are watching closely.</td>
      <td>The tussle between Big Tech and a government Down Under is a preview of the battle to come globally.<br />The Australian Parliament started debate this week on legislation to force digital platforms to negotiate with media companies on payment for news. Under the proposed law, if the two sides fail to reach a deal, they would be brought to binding arbitration. The bill would also require technology companies to give notice to news companies of algorithm changes that will materially affect traffic and to give the publishers collective-bargaining power. The government would determine which tech platforms are subject to the law, but it would likely start with  Google  and  Facebook ,  the dominant companies in online advertising. With bipartisan support, the legislation will likely pass soon.<br />The two American companies have pushed back hard. Google threatened last year to shut down its search engine in Australia. Facebook has said users in the country might not be allowed to share links to news articles if the bill is passed.<br />But the looming legislation seems to be forcing the two tech giants to the negotiating table. Google reached agreements with two of the country’s largest broadcasters this week, including a deal equivalent to $23.3 million a year deal with Nine Entertainment, according to local media.<br />While Australia is a small market for the companies—its online advertising market was valued at only $7 billion in 2019, according to Interactive Advertising Bureau—the new law could have big repercussions if other countries follow suit. The European Union overhauled its copyright laws in 2019, though the changes seem more limited in scope and power. How well the Australian approach works could end up shaping the regulatory direction there. European officials proposed two bills for regulating internet companies last month.</td>

      <td>Fourth-quarter results mark a sharp turnaround for the fashion house after years of outperformance</td>
      <td>PARIS—Gucci fell further behind its big competitors in the fourth quarter, as the Italian fashion house stumbled without tourist shoppers filling its boutiques during the pandemic.<br />Revenue at Gucci for the quarter was 2.3 billion euros, equivalent to $2.8 billion and down 14% from a year earlier, parent company  Kering SA  said Wednesday. For the entire year, revenue fell 23% to €7.4 billion.<br />The results mark a sharp turnaround for Gucci after years of outperformance under Creative Director Alessandro Michele. In the fourth quarter, Gucci lagged well behind the leading fashion brands of  LVMH  Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy SE: Louis Vuitton and Dior.<br />Those two brands reported surging revenue in the second half of last year after the industry was allowed to reopen its boutiques following lockdowns across the world in the first half of 2020. Revenue at LVMH’s fashion and leather-goods division—which is mostly Louis Vuitton and Dior—rose 14% for the quarter.<br />The drop during the pandemic has exposed Gucci’s heavy reliance on tourist shoppers, particularly for stores in Europe that have depended on Chinese clientele coming to the region. The brand is in the midst of tweaking its image to burnish its appeal among clientele older than 40, an effort partly directed at Europeans.</td>

More than 8.5 million shares were sold last year by insiders at these companies, compared with 4.7 million shares in 2019.<br />In dollar terms, much of the sales came at a single company, Moderna, maker of one of two Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. Executives and a director there sold more than $321 million of their stock in more than 700 transactions.  Merck  & Co. insiders sold $58 million of their shares. At  Novavax Inc.,  executives sold more than $40 million of their shares after the company’s vaccine hit milestones in August and September.<br />Merck, which last May said it was pursuing two vaccines, scrapped those efforts last month after data showed disappointing immune responses.

      <td>U.S. shoppers likely boosted their spending in January, buoyed by the stimulus payments that many Americans received in the most recent $900 billion Covid-19 relief package.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimated that retail sales—a measure of spending at stores, vehicle dealerships, restaurants and online—increased a seasonally adjusted 1.2% in January from a month earlier. The projected rise would follow three consecutive months of declining sales during the 2020 holiday shopping season.<br />Robert Rosener, senior U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, forecasts the report “will be the start of exiting the worst of the softer data winter we’ve seen,” with the $600-a-recipient stimulus checks distributed in early January the main factor driving an uptick in spending.<br />Still, he said he expects spending was uneven across sectors last month, with categories like apparel and restaurants continuing to suffer from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and social-distancing measures. The U.S. experienced a sharp surge in coronavirus cases after the holidays.<br />Allen Merry said he used his recent stimulus check to buy a used acoustic guitar from a local musical instrument shop.</td>

      <td>Plenty of companies are cutting costs to weather the pandemic recession. Few are trying to do so while also spending billions of dollars to satisfy their regulators.<br />These are the tasks facing  Wells Fargo  & Co. Chief Executive Charles Scharf, who is attempting to slash at least $8 billion from the San Francisco bank’s annual budget. The bank’s expenses last year were $57.63 billion.<br />Wells Fargo is simultaneously shelling out money to remake the vast risk-and-control systems that regulators have said were inadequate to catch the fake-account scandal that got it in hot water more than four years ago. Wells is still subject to 10 regulatory penalties known as consent orders. The harshest, from the Federal Reserve, has capped the bank’s growth for three years.<br />How Wells Fargo fixes its back-end systems—and whether that clashes with other priorities—might hold clues for competitors as well. Wells came into the pandemic in worse financial shape than most large banks, but others must also modernize their controls while managing through the recession.<br />Citigroup Inc.  was hit with a $400 million fine over its own controls last year. The bank has been hiring key staff and making significant investments.  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. paid $250 million last year as a result of deficiencies in its internal controls, which it has remedied.</td>

It plans to let users bet on “yes” or “no” answers to questions about future events. For instance, had the platform existed last year, it might have asked users whether a Covid-19 vaccine would be approved by the end of 2020.<br />The San Francisco-based startup hopes to benefit from surging interest in trading by individual investors. Individuals have jumped into stocks and options during the past year, using apps like those offered by Robinhood Markets Inc. Kalshi also hopes its marketplace will be used by people and businesses looking to hedge against risks that they face from future events.<br />Kalshi’s fundraising round comes after it won approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in November to run a derivatives exchange. Sequoia led the Series A round, which brings the total money raised by Kalshi since its 2018 founding to about $36 million.<br />Other investors in the round include Henry R. Kravis, the billionaire co-founder of private-equity giant KKR & Co. Inc., and SV Angel, a seed-stage venture firm whose investments have included  Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.

      <td>As richer nations secure supplies, poorer countries struggle to inoculate their populations</td>
      <td>In the race to vaccinate the world against Covid-19, developing countries are running dangerously behind as mutations of the virus make it harder to catch up—a situation that could spell at least another year of humanitarian and economic misery for poor nations.<br />The U.S. has now administered vaccine doses to around 15% of its population, while Europe has reached about 5%. But in South America, just 1.8% of the population had been given a vaccine by this week, while Asia reached 1.5% and Africa 0.1%, according to Our World in Data, a project based at Oxford University.<br />Almost 130 countries are yet to administer a single dose, the World Health Organization said recently. Just two countries in sub-Saharan Africa—the Seychelles and Mauritius—have started vaccinating a substantial proportion of front-line workers, though others are likely to roll out shots in the coming days.<br />The critically short supply of vaccines for poorer nations risks being curtailed further by the emergence of new variants of the virus, including in South Africa and Brazil, that appear to make some of the vaccines that have been secured less effective. Large parts of Africa and some countries in Latin America and Asia are unlikely to cover most of their populations before 2023 or 2024, experts say.<br />All that means it could be years before life returns to normal in poorer countries, which saw more than 100 million people fall back into extreme poverty last year and which lack resources to unleash government spending as much as rich countries have. Some emerging-market countries that were able to mount domestic stimulus last year are running out of resources to continue.</td>

But the prior relationship between Mr. LaPierre and the Brewer firm makes it “highly unlikely” that as the NRA’s counsel the Brewer firm would look into or advocate for any claims the group may have against him, the U.S. Trustee said.<br />“The statements in this legal filing, like others, reflect a misinformed view of the Brewer firm, its billings and its advocacy for the NRA,” said Charles L. Cotton, first vice president of the NRA. “I, and all the officers, fully support the work the firm is doing, the results achieved, and the value of its services.

The pandemic turned this process on its head, but it’s not all bad. Networking chats have become easier to set up. When connecting means clicking “join meeting” rather than traveling to a coffee shop, people are much more available. Without the need for a subway ride or a sticky name tag from security, an open half-hour truly is 30 minutes long.<br />The downside is that there is no real opportunity for spontaneous meetings and connections.

      <td>How bad energy policy led to rolling blackouts in the freezing Lone Star State.</td>
      <td>Why are millions of Americans in the nation’s most energy-rich state without power and heat for days amid extreme winter weather? “The people who have fallen short with regard to the power are the private power generation companies,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott explained. Ah, yes, blame private power companies . . . that are regulated by government.<br />The Republican sounds like California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who lambasted private utilities for rolling blackouts during a heat wave last summer. Power grids should be able to withstand extreme weather. But in both these bellwether states, state and federal energy policies have created market distortions and reduced grid reliability.<br />Mr. Abbott blamed his state’s extensive power outages on generators freezing early Monday morning, noting “this includes the natural gas & coal generators.” But frigid temperatures and icy conditions have descended on most of the country. Why couldn’t Texas handle them while other states did?<br />The problem is Texas’s overreliance on wind power that has left the grid more vulnerable to bad weather. Half of wind turbines froze last week, causing wind’s share of electricity to plunge to 8% from 42%. Power prices in the wholesale market spiked, and grid regulators on Friday warned of rolling blackouts. Natural gas and coal generators ramped up to cover the supply gap but couldn’t meet the surging demand for electricity—which half of households rely on for heating—even as many families powered up their gas furnaces. Then some gas wells and pipelines froze.<br />In short, there wasn’t sufficient baseload power from coal and nuclear to support the grid. Baseload power is needed to stabilize grid frequency amid changes in demand and supply. When there’s not enough baseload power, the grid gets unbalanced and power sources can fail. The more the grid relies on intermittent renewables like wind and solar, the more baseload power is needed to back them up.</td>

      <td>As states weigh reform, a new project aims to collect best practices.</td>
      <td>Hundreds of bills to reform voting processes have already been introduced in state legislatures this year, but there’s plenty that the laboratories of democracy could learn from one another. To that end, it’s worth watching a new project of the Republican State Leadership Committee.<br />The RSLC, which is the umbrella group for GOP state lawmakers and secretaries of state, is launching a commission on election reform. “We want to find the best practices that are used in every state in the union, and make sure those are available for legislative bodies in the 50 states to consider as options,” says one of the co-chairs, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill. “We have a singular goal, and that is to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat—period.”<br />A call went out for ideas some weeks ago, and state leaders submitted suggested best practices on everything from signature verification to audit procedures to pre-election testing of voting equipment. The new commission’s role, Mr. Merrill says, will be to sort through that stack, and more, to “see how we can determine which ones need to be presented to legislative bodies across the nation.” The aim, he adds, is for the commission to have something substantive to release within weeks.<br />The potential here won’t be lost on anyone who followed the 2020 election mess. To take one example, voters amid the pandemic adopted mail ballots en masse, but some states don’t handle absentee votes until Election Day. Pennsylvania legislators considered allowing preprocessing but disagreed with the Governor on how many days were needed. That’s one small reason the Associated Press didn’t call Pennsylvania for Joe Biden until four days after Nov. 3. State law also lacks clear rules for signature verification, and counties diverged on whether to count undated ballots.<br />For states moving toward absentee voting, Mr. Merrill says, the model should be their peers like Colorado that have gone to mail ballots exclusively. “When you talk about mail-in,” adds the commission’s other co-chair, Michigan state Senator Ruth Johnson, “the devil is in the details, if you want to have that transparency and accountability and integrity. It’s not good or bad, necessarily, but the devil is in the details.”</td>

      <td>Can President Biden’s regulators say no to progressives when they try to bend the law? An early test will come for Mr. Biden’s nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler. Nasdaq is seeking the SEC’s blessing to enforce new diversity mandates for corporate boards. But as Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey and all 11 other Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee explain in a new letter to the SEC, the quotas run headlong into federal securities law.<br />Every company must have “one director who self-identifies as female,” and one “who self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+,” the stock exchange instructs. Alternatively, the company can publicly “explain why” it “does not have at least two directors on its board who self-identify in the categories listed above”—identifying itself as a Nasdaq pariah.<br />The Senators write that they “commend individual firms for the proactive efforts they have already made in recruiting, promoting, and maintaining diverse talent.” But they go on to say that Nasdaq’s mandates fail “to demonstrate that this proposed rule advances investor protection” or “is otherwise consistent with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.”<br />The diversity mandate conflicts with the law’s command that companies nominate board members who will serve the best interest of shareholders. The Senators observe that “religion, age, political affiliation, geographic location, educational background, veteran’s status, or physical disability” are also measures of board diversity. Yet Nasdaq ignores them in favor of categories that align with elite America’s political mood. That suggests the interests of investors aren’t the priority.<br />The Senators add that the Nasdaq rule also “violates the concept of materiality” in securities law. Materiality focuses disclosure on information that is critical to an investor’s decision. “The materiality doctrine prevents the development of an unstable, politicized securities regime that would be ripe for abuse of power,” they write. Securities law leaves “social policymaking for democratically elected representatives.” Nasdaq wants to make social policy by forcing disclosure of information that “would not help a reasonable investor evaluate a company’s performance.”</td>

Mitch McConnell at its helm.”<br />Mr. McConnell joined all but seven Republicans in voting Saturday to acquit Mr. Trump in his impeachment trial, but followed that with a speech that laid blame on the former president for stirring up a crowd, as the two Republicans and their respective allies engage in a broader fight over Mr. Trump’s future role in the party.<br />“They did this because they had been fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on Earth—because he was angry he’d lost an election,” Mr. McConnell said. “Former President Trump’s actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty.”<br />While Mr. McConnell took the position that it was unconstitutional to put a former president on trial, he added: “We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.”</td>

      <td>Washington should not tolerate foreign actors who wrongfully or unlawfully imprison U.S. citizens.</td>
      <td>As President Biden revamps many aspects of U.S. diplomacy and national security, he should adopt a policy that none of his predecessors had the courage or resolve to: zero tolerance for the unjust detention of Americans abroad. The wrongful detentions of some 40 to 50 U.S. citizens have been publicly reported, but the real number is likely much higher. The State Department in 2019 estimated that around 3,000 Americans are imprisoned abroad, but it has never looked into whether the detentions are just.<br />The U.S. government has increased its focus on freeing unlawfully or wrongfully detained Americans in recent years, but it hasn’t gone far enough. President Obama created an interagency system to assist families and coordinate government response. President Trump went further, securing the release of dozens of Americans from a variety of countries including Egypt, Turkey and Iran, as well as from terrorist groups such as the Taliban.<br />Yet the Trump administration’s efforts were uneven. It failed to secure the release of longtime American hostages such as Siamak and Baquer Namazi in Iran or Austin Tice in Syria. And it went strangely out of its way to assist some Americans whose detentions appeared to be legitimate, such as rapper A$AP Rocky, who was arrested in Sweden after a street fight, and three University of California, Los Angeles basketball players arrested in China for shoplifting.<br />Not every important change has come from the executive branch. Under a new provision, tucked into a law passed in late December, the State Department must review all cases involving U.S. citizens detained abroad and determine, based on 11 criteria, which are unjustly detained. When this determination is made, the case must be referred to the special presidential envoy on hostage affairs to develop and implement a strategy to secure their release. These collective efforts in individual cases will be presented in an annual report to Congress, creating greater visibility and focus on bringing them home.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken is off to a strong start in building on these efforts. At his confirmation hearing, he testified that “doing everything we possibly can to bring any American home who is being unjustly detained anywhere in the world or is a hostage” is a priority. This was an important warning to governments that wrongfully detain U.S. citizens.</td>

      <td>In my small Missouri town, we’re awaiting an exodus from the beleaguered cities.</td>
      <td>Tarkio, Mo.<br />I’ve read at least a dozen articles predicting a movement away from cities toward the hinterlands as urbanites flee crime, congestion and Covid for a simpler life. Remote work is the wave of the future, and we’ll all be doing our Zoom conferences from somewhere else. Manhattan and Silicon Valley will look like mining ghost towns, places where the mother lode has been exhausted. Even though Miami and Austin, Texas, seem to be the preferred destinations for the techno-refugees, U-Haul reports that Missouri is the seventh leading destination for people using its services.<br />In my northwestern Missouri town of some 1,500 people, we’re not exactly bracing for a population boom. Sure, we’ve got internet, I’ve done dozens of remote meetings in the past year, and I’m sure that some of the locals have discovered the joys of Robinhood, but young urban professionals are much likelier to leave New York or San Jose for Boise, Idaho, or the Hill Country of Texas. Tarkio isn’t on their menu.<br />That’s a shame. Tarkio has been declining since about 1900, but it’s not that bad. We’re close to the interstate, and the flooding along the Missouri is always at least 7 miles away. Riots are nonexistent, at least so far, but so is street life. Which has its advantages. You don’t need a bike lane when small animals can live out their life spans in the middle of Spruce Street, where I live, without being disturbed by traffic.<br />The biggest scandal in town is that this summer we had a rash of people blowing grass clippings into the streets. This, I gather from social-media posts, is dangerous to motorcycles. I’ve only ever seen one two-wheeled vehicle drive by my house. Billy, the local biker, has a bandanna, a T-shirt, a mullet and a motor scooter that tops out at about 30 miles an hour. He’s not exactly the Hell’s Angels, but if keeping grass out of the streets helps Bill, I’m in.</td>

      <td>Inventing words was once thought pretentious. Now it is considered an achievement, though it may still induce ‘coiner’s remorse.’</td>
      <td>The children’s author Theodor Geisel, otherwise known as Dr. Seuss, was often asked where he drew inspiration for his verbal inventiveness. Surely there had to be some enchanted source for the words he dreamed up—the ones that caught on, notably “grinch,” and the ones that might pleasingly have done so, such as “punkerish” and “flubbulous.” He would solemnly reply that in August each year he traveled to have his cuckoo clock serviced in a tiny Alpine village called Uber Gletch. “I wander around and talk to people in the streets,” he explained. “They are very strange people, and I get my ideas from them.”<br />Dr. Seuss is one of the heroes of “The Hidden History of Coined Words,” in which Ralph Keyes—the author of more than a dozen books, including “Euphemania” and “I Love It When You Talk Retro”—explores the byways of etymology. But, as this eloquent and instructive survey shows, the stories behind coinages are seldom so zany or romantic. Mr. Keyes makes clear how hard it is to create a word and get other people to adopt it—even if it has the virtues of brevity, vividness, a playful air and a memorable sound. Although new nouns, verbs and adjectives are forever coming into being, most make no impression. Some sparkle for a while, then fade from view. Only a few succeed, and they are “as likely to be created by chance as by intention.”<br />The first person to refer to “coining” words seems to have been George Puttenham, a 16th-century English courtier. Although quite a coiner himself—“insect,” “predatory,” “indecency”—he was ambivalent about the habit. For many of his contemporaries, new words were as unwelcome as bad smells, and 300 years after Puttenham complained about semi-educated students getting snared in new-fangled verbiage, it was still common to think that coining words was shamefully pretentious. Mark Twain was at pains to tell a correspondent that he’d never done it, though he conceded that he might have called attention to a few previously obscure terms. Theodore Roosevelt was relieved to think he bore no responsibility for any coinage. This from the man who minted “bully pulpit” and “lunatic fringe.”<br />Today it’s a different story. We prize the ability to give a phenomenon a catchy handle, and people’s coinages are regarded as part of their legacy. Take the New York Times obituaries of psychologists George Weinberg and Herbert Freudenberger, which even in their headlines identify the deceased as the coiners of important words: “homophobia” and “burnout,” respectively. But in many cases the person who takes credit for a word—or is awarded credit—isn’t the first to have used it. The term “emotional intelligence” wasn’t invented by Daniel Goleman, whose first book on the topic was so popular in the mid-1990s, and “tipping point” predates Malcolm Gladwell’s bestseller of a few years later.<br />Mr. Keyes admires several writers whose originative powers seem beyond dispute. One is the poet John Milton, who gave us “jubilant,” “depravity,” “echoing” and “fragrance.” Another is Milton’s contemporary Sir Thomas Browne, who came up with “suicide,” “ferocious” and “misconception.” But the abiding impression of Mr. Keyes’s account is that a coinage is a happy accident, often the result of a prank or a moment of whimsy—and that in most cases the person behind it will have left no other mark on the language.</td>

These manipulators will never be found. But shut up about that too.<br />Folks in the Northeast accustomed to weeklong outages may be surprised when Texans mostly have their power back in hours. Hundreds of downed power lines aren’t the problem as they are elsewhere. Texas winter blackouts come wholesale when generating plants trip offline due to conditions that will quickly be remedied when temperatures return to the 50s and 60s this weekend.<br />In fact, Texas has plenty of generation to keep its system from cracking even under summer air-conditioning demand, and more than enough in principle for a winter cold snap. Texas’ grid operator pledged to get to the bottom of why 34,000 megawatts nevertheless dropped offline, but we already know the answer because the same thing happened in 2011 and 1989.</td>

      <td>If the filibuster is a ‘Jim Crow relic,’ so is a policy designed to curtail the abundance of black labor.</td>
      <td>Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week that the House version of the next coronavirus aid package will include a $15 federal minimum wage, adding that “27 million people will get a raise, 70% of them women.”<br />In truth, Mrs. Pelosi has no idea how many people would see a raise because she doesn’t know how many people would keep their jobs. Employers may decide that they can’t afford to pay someone a $15 hourly wage, so workers could be let go or offered fewer hours as a result. A new Congressional Budget Office report estimates that 1.4 million jobs would vanish, and no one knows how many people would never be hired in the first place because they’ve been priced out of the labor force. Politicians gloss over these trade-offs, but they are basic economic facts of life.<br />Mrs. Pelosi’s reference to female workers is also misleading. Democrats have long held up single working moms as the typical minimum-wage earner, but that’s a myth. A 2014 analysis by economists Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser found that the vast majority of workers who would benefit from a minimum-wage increase live in nonpoor households. According to Mr. Sabia, “only 13 percent of workers who would be affected live in poor households, while nearly two-thirds live in households with incomes over twice the poverty line, and over 40 percent live in households with incomes over three times the poverty line.”<br />Such findings would seem to underscore the limits of using minimum-wage laws to address poverty. Most workers who earn minimum wages are not a family’s sole breadwinner. They tend to be teenagers living at home or senior citizens working part-time to stay busy in retirement. According to Mr. Sabia, single mothers made up less than 5% of those who potentially would benefit from a minimum-wage hike.<br />What Democrats play down is that most minimum-wage earners aren’t impoverished, and most people who qualify as poor already earn more than the minimum. Poor families need jobs more than they need raises. And what teens and young adults most need are opportunities to accumulate job experience that can lead to higher pay and upward social mobility down the road. By reducing employment opportunities, minimum-wage laws can make inequality worse.</td>

      <td>Federal appeals-court judges on Tuesday ruled that police disciplinary records in New York City may be made public, dismissing an appeal brought by unions for police, firefighters and corrections officers to block the disclosure of the information.<br />The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals’ ruling affirmed a Manhattan federal judge’s previous decision that the disciplinary records should be made public. It also lifted a stay from September that prevented the publication of the records.<br />A coalition of unions sued New York City in July seeking to block the release of officers’ disciplinary records in cases where claims against them are unsubstantiated, arguing that the publication of the records would harm the officers. A three-judge panel found that argument lacked merit.<br />New York public-safety agencies—including the New York Police Department—have long cited Section 50-a of the state’s Civil Rights law in decisions to keep secret the disciplinary files of officers. The statute said personnel records used to evaluate the performance of a public safety officer are deemed confidential and cannot be exposed without a court order or the written consent of the employee.<br />State lawmakers in June voted to repeal the law as part of a series of changes to policing that followed nationwide protests inspired by the May 25 killing of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd, a Black man, was killed in police custody in Minneapolis. Soon after the law was repealed, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, announced plans to create a public online repository of NYPD records. Subsequently, the unions brought their suit.</td>

This column, originally published Sept. 20, 2020, contains smartphone tips for people enduring outages, as well as advice to prepare for such adversities.<br />As an inferno sweeps the West and hurricanes spin over the Atlantic, power outages pose a big risk for those living in affected areas. Recently, in California, the utility  PG&E  pre-emptively shut off power to prevent the spread of wildfire, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers in the dark.<br />No matter where you live, it’s good to prepare for a blackout before it’s too late.

Here’s how to get your other lifeline—your smartphone and connected devices—ready and powered up in case of an emergency.<br />Turn on emergency alerts. Wireless Emergency Alerts, or WEA, are messages that can be sent by local and federal authorities, including the National Weather Service and Federal Emergency Management Agency, directly to smartphones over cellular networks. Most devices released after 2012 are able to receive the alerts.<br />If you’ve ever experienced a sudden, blaring tone or buzz accompanied by a grim message—an alert for a missing person perhaps—that’s a WEA.</td>

      <td>Nico Muhly’s two-person opera inspired by the true story of Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailor who helped two inmates escape; a SOLO performance by John Holiday of an 1887 temperance poem set to music by Tyshawn Sorey.</td>
      <td><br />The pandemic shutdown has pushed opera companies to commission new works designed to be viewed on computer screens. Catapult Opera, founded by the conductor Neal Goren (formerly head of the now-defunct Gotham Chamber Opera), had planned to present its first-ever season live in 2020-21. Foiled by Covid-19, the company instead launched a digital commissioning program. The first result is “The Glitch,” a 22-minute, two-character opera by composer Nico Muhly and librettist Greg Pierce. As filmed by director Marcus Shields, performed by baritone Lester Lynch and soprano Krysty Swann, and conducted by Mr. Goren, the piece powerfully demonstrates how the small screen can make opera—often the grandest of art forms—truly intimate.<br />The characters are based on real people: Joyce “Tilly” Mitchell and her husband, Lyle. In 2015, Tilly, a civilian employee who worked in the tailor shop of a prison, helped two inmates escape by providing prison contraband. She had agreed to accompany them once the men broke out, and part of the scheme involved killing her husband. But at the last minute, she did not join the convicts on the run and Lyle was not murdered. The opera imagines Tilly’s conversation with her husband after she has confessed and gone to prison herself. (Readers might remember the story from the television series “Escape at Dannemora,” which dramatized the tale.)<br />Mr. Pierce’s trenchant libretto drills deep into the couple’s questions for each other and themselves, their motives and their bond. “How could you? Who are you?” Lyle asks. Tilly’s response, a romantic fantasy about the prisoner Richie and a dream of escape from everyday life, turns darker with her realization that Richie, a convicted murderer, might well have abandoned or killed her while they were on the lam. Lyle answers her erotic taunting with an invented dalliance of his own that Tilly knows almost instantly is a lie. And even though Tilly suggests that killing Lyle (whom the conspirators called the “glitch” in the plan) was her idea, not Richie’s, and that she wants to be rid of him even now, he insists that he will stand by her.<br />“The Glitch” delves so skillfully into the immediate emotional reality of these two people that you don’t even need to know the background. Mr. Muhly’s lyrical vocal settings and atmospheric piano accompaniment performed by Adam Tendler feel like natural expressions of emotion, be they rapturous imaginings or angry confusion. The singers are filmed with darkness around them, as if they are alone in the void with their feelings and each other; Mr. Shields astutely often shows the reacting partner instead of the singing one, so we hear the words and see their effect. The intensity of the voices—Mr. Lynch’s opulent baritone and Ms. Swann’s wiry mezzo—and both singers’ remarkable ability to act with their faces are such that their performances never seem oversized or artificial on the small screen. Instead, we are drawn into their worlds. The real power of opera is less in its grandeur than in its ability to express the otherwise inexpressible; “The Glitch” does that with extraordinary grace.</td>

      <td><br /><br /><br />The first sound we hear on “Hardline”—the opening track from “Little Oblivions” (Matador), the new album by 25-year-old Julien Baker—is a heavy chord from an organ that brings to mind the sanctity of church but also, with its woolly distortion, distress. In the context of Ms. Baker’s oeuvre, this sound alone marks a major shift.<br />Her first album, 2015’s “Sprained Ankle,” a collection of shadowy folk numbers, almost exclusively featured her voice, acoustic guitar, and a bit of piano. On 2017’s acclaimed follow-up, “Turn Out the Lights,” she plugged her instrument into an amp and added touches of strings and woodwinds, but the record was drum-free and still spare in the extreme. Yet that organ chord on “Hardline” and the percussion that enters shortly after suggest that we’re in for a different kind of experience on album number three, one where instrumental color and sharper melodies share the load with Ms. Baker’s dark lyrics and expressive singing.</td>

      <td>New gun-control legislation could allow cities to ban handguns</td>
      <td>Canada is introducing new gun-control legislation that would make it possible for individual cities to ban handguns at a local level and says it will create a buyback program for military-style semiautomatic weapons that were banned from use by the country’s Liberal government last year.<br />The planned legislation will also create new offenses for altering a magazine to allow more shots to be fired without reloading, and develop a system that would allow concerned friends or family members to apply to a court and request the immediate, temporary removal of an individual’s firearms.<br />The planned measures come nearly a year after Canada prohibited the use of more than 1,500 models of military-style semiautomatic weapons, including the AR-15. AR-15 style rifles have been used in some of the deadliest U.S. mass shootings, including attacks at a concert in Las Vegas in 2017 and a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 2018.<br />The Canadian government said it plans to introduce a buyback program for the banned firearms in the coming months, and will make it illegal to transfer, sell or bequeath the weapons outside of that program.<br />The government said its buyback program will be voluntary. That means someone who decides not to turn in a banned military-style semiautomatic weapon can still store it as a collectors’ item but must abide by rules governing its storage and can never transfer or legally use the firearm.</td>

      <td>In a Netflix series based on the Sarah Pinborough novel, coincidences lead a single mom to become entangled with a psychiatrist and his troubled wife.</td>
      <td>There’s no such thing as coincidence, people say, but those people have not seen “Behind Her Eyes,” which presents several whoppers of happenstance before it’s even warmed up. As readers of the Sarah Pinborough novel know—and unsuspecting customers will find out—mere terrestrial phenomena of time and place can’t hold a votive candle to the otherworldly avenues the storyline will follow, into what will no doubt be dead ends of epic eye-rolling and consumer consternation.<br />All of which is odd, because the six-part series, created by Steve Lightfoot, does what it does very well, as long as it remains rooted in the human. Louise (Simona Brown) and David (Tom Bateman) literally run into each other inside a London pub, requiring Louise to compensate for the drink spilled on David. He will thereafter smooch Louise when they’re saying good night on the sidewalk. She’s not entirely unreceptive, but he’s apologetic and flees into the night. And wouldn’t you know it? The next day, David turns out to be the new psychiatrist at the medical practice where Louise works as a secretary.<br />“What’re the odds?” Louise will say, to which a viewer might respond “You tell me.”<br />The divorced Louise has a son, Adam (Tyler Howitt), who is adorable; the married David has a wife, Adele (Eve Hewson), who is disturbed. How and why are the mysteries that propel the first couple of episodes. She seems to be a doting spouse. “They’re lucky to have you,” Adele says, as her husband leaves for his first day on the new job. “Like me.” He cringes. When she assures him that “I’ll be here” when he gets home that night, it sounds like a threat. Generally speaking, sex scenes are, all titillation aside, fairly useless. They tell you nothing about characters or motivations. But thanks to Norwegian filmmaker Erik Richter Strand, who directed this entire U.K.-based series, the one between Adele and David says almost everything about their relationship that needs to be said. It’s eloquent, as is one that comes later in the show, and contains all the joy the first one lacks.<br />There are tantalizing bread crumbs of psychological innuendo strewn all over the path from Scotland, where we meet a much younger Adele, to London, where she and David have only recently moved. They’ve had to relocate frequently over the intervening 10 years, it seems, and the reasons will become more and more evident after Louise, walking down the street, literally knocks Adele over. They’ve not previously met, but soon discover they have David in common. The chance encounters just keep coming.</td>

      <td>Jennifer Harrington’s smart horror film skewers social-media influencers—literally.</td>
      <td>That the horror platform Shudder is presenting “Shook” is appropriate enough: The streaming service is a virtual catalog of frightful content, and Jennifer Harrington’s feature is a connoisseur’s movie. An update on the slasher film, it takes the plot devices common to the classics of the form—the ultraviolence, the simple morality, the deserving victims, the emotionally tortured villains—and tweaks them into today. Most significantly, and humorously, Ms. Harrington uses social media the way “Halloween,” “Scream” and “When a Stranger Calls” used the land-line telephone—as a weaponized instrument of torment.<br />That director Harrington makes social-media influencers the victims of her mayhem—but not before making them ridiculous—is a guilty pleasure, and meant to be. When we first see Mia (Daisye Tutor) and her fellow stars of online marketing, they are being photographed at what appears to be a red-carpet event. Lights are flashing. Mics are waving. Enthusiastic crowd noise is percolating. Then the camera pulls back and we see the truth—the young women and their camera crew are inside an otherwise abandoned warehouse, with prerecorded sound pumped in and no one around but them. Which is spooky: On the loose in their Southern California community is a serial murderer of small dogs. Yes, dogs. But before the evening is over, said killer will have graduated to people, with one of the influencers impaled on her own stiletto heel.<br />It has to be said that several of Ms. Harrington’s forays into physical violence (she co-wrote the story with Alesia Glidewell) will make one wince, flinch and/or recoil. But such cringe-inducing content is hardly foreign territory within the genre being deconstructed. Nor are ambivalent characters. Mia, for instance, is a classically conflicted heroine/victim: Her late mother, who died of the hereditary “Livingston’s disease,” was cared for solely by Mia’s sister, Nicole (a terrific and funny Emily Goss), who asked Mia for help and was rebuffed. Needing to travel for her own medical care, Nicole asks Mia to babysit her dog, and for the first time Mia agrees to do it—but only because it’s good for her brand, given the ongoing dog murders. (No dogs are actually harmed in the making of this movie, but there are crime-scene photos…) Once she’s alone at Nicole’s, with the dog, Mia is besieged by threatening calls, from someone who at times seems to be inside the house.<br />One of Ms. Harrington’s ingenious moves is the demonization of the smart home, and the possible repercussions of living one’s life online. “How do you know Jade?” Mia asks her mystery caller, when he refers to one of her friends. How would he not know Jade? Everything about Mia’s life is available on the web, or courtesy of Alexa (renamed Diana here, after Nicole and Mia’s mother). Nicole’s house is set up with surveillance cameras (because of her invalid mom); Mia’s life is one long live feed. Her every thought becomes a text. The horror isn’t just about what’s going to happen to her, but the life she leads. At least for the time being.<br />“Shook” has the requisite twists to make it much more than a straightforward horror-shocker, and the sharp turns are sufficient to have viewers profoundly dizzy about where it’s all going to go. They may also wonder, as I did, why imperiled dogs are more nervous-making than imperiled people. But that’s part of Ms. Harrington’s commentary on a genre in which people are disposable and pets make you worry.</td>

      <td>The NAACP, on behalf of Rep. Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against former President Donald Trump and his former personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, accusing them of conspiring to incite the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />The lawsuit also names two right-wing groups, Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, as defendants. Some members of each group have been arrested in connection with the attack, which left five people, including one police officer, dead.<br />The lawsuit, filed in Washington alleges that Messrs. Trump and Giuliani and members of the two groups conspired to prevent Congress from fulfilling its official duties to certify election results—which they allege violates the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act. That law, which targeted unrest after the Civil War, allows suits seeking compensation for civil-rights violations.<br />Lawmakers were in the process of certifying President Biden’s electoral victories on Jan. 6 when the rioters swarmed the Capitol, halting the process for hours. Lawmakers and aides were rushed out of the House and Senate chambers, huddling in office buildings and, in some cases, hiding for hours until law enforcement was able to end the riot. Videos played during the impeachment trial showed the mob coming close to finding aides hiding in the Capitol.<br />“January 6th was one of the most shameful days in our country’s history, and it was instigated by the President himself. His gleeful support of violent white supremacists led to a breach of the Capitol that put my life, and that of my colleagues, in grave danger,” Mr. Thompson said in a statement.</td>

      <td>Brigade Capital Management and other investors win court ruling allowing them to keep the Revlon loan payment they received from their agent Citi</td>
      <td>A federal judge denied  Citigroup Inc.’s  request to claw back roughly $500 million it mistakenly paid out of its own pocket to investment firms that made loans to cosmetics giant  Revlon Inc.<br />Brigade Capital Management LP and other Revlon lenders can keep the money they collected from Citi when the bank wired them the full amount they were owed instead of the small interest payment that was due, according to a written ruling Tuesday by Judge Jesse Furman of U.S. District Court in New York.<br />The August blunder by Citi, Revlon’s loan agent, satisfied a nearly $900 million debt that Revlon wasn’t due to pay until 2023 and delivered an unexpected windfall to lenders on what had become an increasingly risky investment.<br />While some lenders that were mistakenly paid returned roughly $385 million to Citi, others refused the bank’s request for repayment, touching off a legal dispute that strained relationships with big investors like Brigade, a longtime Citi client, and raised questions with analysts about the bank’s internal controls.<br />Judge Furman issued the decision after holding a trial in December that focused on the pivotal question of what Brigade and other recipients knew or suspected soon after they were paid.</td>

      <td>Iraqi and American officials aim to figure out how militants struck a heavily guarded air base used by U.S. in its campaign against Islamic State</td>
      <td>Iraqi and U.S. officials deepened an investigation Tuesday into a deadly rocket attack on a U.S. military base in Iraqi Kurdistan, as they sought to establish how militants managed to strike one of the country’s most heavily guarded facilities.<br />The U.S.-led military coalition in the region said approximately 14 rockets were fired toward the city of Erbil on Monday, with three hitting the key air base used by the U.S. military in its campaign against Islamic State. A civilian U.S. contractor who was a Filipino national was killed and nine others were injured.<br />At least three other people were injured outside of the base, according to Iraqi officials. Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s self-governing Kurdish region, has long been an enclave of calm in a region still recovering from years of war.<br />The air base is located within a high-security complex that also includes Erbil’s civilian international airport. The airport is protected by multiple layers of security and managed to keep operating even when Islamic State forces came within mere miles of the city in 2014.<br />President Biden was briefed on the attack, a White House spokesman said Monday night, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Kurdistan Regional Government Prime Minister Masrour Barzani and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi to discuss the attack, according to officials from both countries.</td>

      <td>Data-mining company to expand sales force, aiming   for more than 30% growth annually over next five years</td>
      <td>Palantir Technologies Inc.  shares dropped sharply Tuesday after the data-mining company laid out its expectations for revenue growth over the next few years and said it would beef up its sales force.<br />Palantir has joined a cohort of firms whose market debuts have been welcomed by many investors, some of whom are looking for technology-driven companies to grow rapidly to justify their valuations. The Denver-based company, which provides software focused on helping businesses as well as defense and intelligence agencies analyze data, saw its shares rise from a $10 debut in a direct listing in September to as high as $39 in late January, according to FactSet.<br />The stock has fallen since then and traded down about 12% to $28.05 Tuesday afternoon, as executives said they expect Palantir to generate revenue growth of more than 30% annually over the next five years. That rate could potentially be slower than the 47% gain it recorded for 2020 compared with 2019.<br />The company isn’t “focused on the day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, near-term focus that, quite frankly, destroys businesses,” said Chief Executive Officer Alexander Karp. “It’s one of the main reasons why so many of our businesses, especially in tech, are actually only serving Wall Street and not serving their clients,” he added.<br />Palantir plans to expand its sales team by triple-digit levels this year, operations chief Shyam Sankar told investors Tuesday.</td>

      <td>Exposure and frozen pipes threaten cattle; dairy farmers are forced to dump milk after plant shutdowns</td>
      <td>Bitter cold and power outages have created a crisis for some Texan farms and ranches, leaving livestock dead from exposure and raising fears that herds could run short of food and water.<br />Forced shutdowns of plants that process milk and make animal feed are disrupting the state’s agricultural supply chains, industry executives said. Some farmers are being forced to dump tankers of milk on fields because it can’t be processed, and state agriculture officials feared livestock may have to be euthanized if they cannot be watered and fed.<br />“No feed, no water, and no heat doesn’t make for a good situation,” said Sid Miller, Texas agriculture commissioner. Mr. Miller on Tuesday said he was urging state utilities to restore electricity to rural areas—some of which he said had gone without power for more than 30 hours straight—while fielding calls from cattlemen losing calves to the cold and poultry farmers struggling with frozen water pipes.<br />A rare winter storm over the weekend and record-low temperatures in some parts of Texas caused power demand in the state to outpace supply, as thermostats were cranked up. At the same time, freezing temperatures forced some natural-gas and coal-fired power plants offline, while wind turbines in West Texas froze and snow blanketed banks of solar panels. Texas power officials called for rotating outages to manage the shortfall, but in some parts of the state those measures have led to extended stretches without power.<br />The situation has turned into chaos for some producers in one of the country’s most livestock- and poultry-heavy states. Texas in December counted about 2.9 million cattle on feedlots, the most in the nation, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The state’s dairies house the country’s fifth-largest dairy herd with about 613,000 milking cows, and Texas is the sixth-biggest chicken producer, raising about 675 million birds for slaughter in 2019, according to the latest USDA figures.</td>

      <td>Social distancing and isolation mean we’re missing out on serendipitous exchanges with strangers. Here’s why—and how—we should work to make them happen.</td>
      <td>Aurora Flores hadn’t gone out much during the pandemic. But recently she forced herself to take a walk in New York’s Central Park to clear her mind and seek solace in the sound of birds and a waterfall. As she was strolling down the path, another woman approached, wearing a mask. Letting out a loud yelp, the woman flung a handful of birdseed in the air.<br />Suddenly, a flurry of titmice, cardinals, blue jays and robins appeared, as Ms. Flores stood there amazed. The stranger offered her some seeds, and Ms. Flores poured some on her gloved hand, holding it out in front of her. One by one, the birds began to land on her fingers.<br />“I was elated. I felt blessed,” says Ms. Flores, 67, a writer. “She saw me beaming, and I could tell she smiled. Then she went on her way.” Now, Ms. Flores says she is motivated to go outside almost every day.<br />Strangers can soothe and support us when no one else is around, or boost our mood with a smile or a laugh. They can distract us from the chatter in our own head and help expand our perspective. They can make us feel connected and remind us we are not alone.<br />Yet we’re missing out on many of these serendipitous moments during the pandemic. Social distancing, working from home and the disruption of normal activities have reduced our opportunities for casual exchanges with people we don’t know, or with whom we have only loose ties. Yet, if we work at it, it’s possible to generate those moments even now—and psychologists say we should.</td>

      <td>At the Biden minimum-wage proposal of $15 an hour, forgiving $15,000 in student debt would require 1,000 hours of work.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “The Great Student Loan Scam” (Feb. 10): I would readily support loan forgiveness if the beneficiary were required to do community service for the forgiven debt. I would suggest a rate of $15 an hour, the Biden administration proposed federal minimum wage. So for someone being forgiven $15,000 in debt, he or she would owe 1,000 hours of community service.<br />Jeff Kindl<br />Mandeville, La.<br /><br />You conclude that Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is putting off a vote on student-debt forgiveness because it is only popular with “progressive elites.” Based on our polling, we know support is much broader than that. With backing from two-thirds of people under 56 years old, a majority of American adults say the government should actually annul all student debt. Even boomers, who by a slight majority oppose voiding any student loans, overwhelmingly want the government to insert itself into the marketplace and impose price controls on the cost of higher education.</td>
