      <td>Parler, a moderation-light social media platform that was forced offline last month by tech giants over how it policed its content, has fired its chief executive.<br />John Matze, the former CEO, said he was fired on Friday by the company’s board. He said the board is currently controlled by conservative political donor Rebekah Mercer.<br />“Over the past few months, I’ve met constant resistance to my product vision, my strong belief in free speech and my view of how the Parler site should be managed,” he said in a statement. “For example, I advocated for more product stability and what I believe is a more effective approach to content moderation.”<br />The immediate impact on Parler’s efforts to restore service to its roughly 15 million users isn’t known, though a person familiar with the company said Mr. Matze was responsible for creating much of Parler’s original code.<br />In the months following the U.S. presidential election, Parler carved out a niche but rapidly growing place in social media by wooing conservatives disaffected by mainstream platforms’ efforts to label certain posts and ban users whom they deemed to have violated their guidelines around hate speech, misinformation and false claims of victory by former President Donald Trump.</td>

      <td>Academics and the progressive press mull state media controls.</td>
      <td>The academic establishment and progressive press want you to know two things: First, conservative claims of social-media bias are bogus. As Silicon Valley firms police content, their decisions are, miraculously, wholly uninfluenced by ideological preference.<br />Second, there is an urgent need for a much wider crackdown on political speech, perhaps led by the Biden Administration and requiring the creation of new government agencies. In other words, all that conservative suppression that’s, er, not happening? We need more of it.<br />New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights released a brief this week that is being amplified in the press entitled, “False Accusation: The Unfounded Claim that Social Media Companies Censor Conservatives.” It argues that “some conservatives believe their content is suppressed on partisan grounds when, in fact, it’s being singled out because it violates neutral platform rules.”<br />That is sometimes true, but the report doesn’t remotely prove that it always is. What about when  Twitter  and  Facebook  tried to suppress a New York Post story about Hunter Biden before the 2020 election? Even the report concedes that “the question of whether social media companies harbor an anti-conservative bias can’t be answered conclusively.”<br />That doesn’t stop the authors from unabashedly asserting that “the claim of anti-conservative animus is itself a form of disinformation.” It is perpetuated partly because “it appeals to the same conspiratorial mindset that has fostered the QAnon movement.”</td>

      <td>The monetary magician will try to pull a reform rabbit out of Italy’s hat.</td>
      <td>Mario Draghi is often credited with pulling off the near-impossible conjuring trick of saving the euro during the last decade’s serial sovereign debt crises. So wish him luck as he now attempts a similar David Copperfield act as Italy’s new Prime Minister. He’s going to need it.<br />Mr. Draghi was summoned Wednesday by Italian President Sergio Mattarella to form a government because almost no one else can. Giuseppe Conte’s government—his second coalition in two-and-a-half years—collapsed last month amid infighting over how to spend €209 billion in Covid-19 stimulus money from the European Union. Mr. Draghi’s appointment is Rome’s last hope of pulling together a new government to avoid snap elections.<br />Why Italy wants Mr. Draghi is easy enough to see. His tenure as president of the European Central Bank makes him one of Europe’s most respected politicians, a reputation he has bolstered in retirement by avoiding raucous domestic Italian politics. His gravitas might help him build support among Italian politicians for a new coalition, and it will reassure markets and European leaders that a responsible adult is steering the ship in Rome.<br />Why Mr. Draghi wants the job, however, is a mystery for the ages. He understands exactly what ails Italy’s economy—which we know because he spent his entire time at the ECB begging Rome and other European governments to implement supply-side tax and regulatory reforms. He also presumably understands the political forces that have kept those reforms from happening. Only patriotism can explain why he’s volunteering for such a thankless and futile job.<br />All the more so since his appointment itself points to a fundamental dysfunction in Rome. We say almost no one else can form a government because one other politician probably could: Matteo Salvini of the right-wing League. His coalition of center-right parties was the plurality winner in 2018’s election, and polls suggest the League and aligned parties would fare well if Italy held the snap election it probably needs.</td>

      <td>Biden bars ‘Wuhan virus’ but favors racial preferences at Yale.</td>
      <td>President Biden last week singled out Asian-Americans as he issued executive orders devoted to “advancing racial equity.” They include an order banning federal use of terms such as “Wuhan virus,” and another requiring the Justice Department to better track hate crimes against Asian-Americans. In pushing these measures Mr. Biden prefers to speak of promoting “equity” rather than equal treatment.<br />On Wednesday the Justice Department showed us why when it dropped its lawsuit against Yale University over its race-based admissions. Under former Attorney General Bill Barr, Justice had charged that Yale’s racial preferences violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Justice acted even before the Senate has confirmed a new Attorney General or head of the Civil Rights Division.<br />A similar but private suit against Harvard continues, this one brought by Students for Fair Admissions. But it’s likely the government will soon withdraw its supporting brief that scores Harvard for “systematically disfavoring Asian-American applicants.”<br />So Asian-Americans will be watching. While many will be relieved to see the government rejecting terms such as “China flu,” many also appreciate the real and present harm when America’s most competitive colleges and universities reject their children based on their race no matter their other qualifications.<br />“I am totally shocked by the Biden DOJ’s hasty decision to drop the Yale lawsuit, only eight days after President Biden signed an executive order claiming to combat anti-Asian discrimination,” says the president of the Asian American Coalition for Education, Yukong Zhao.</td>

Bush administration.<br />Mr. Fratto said it makes sense for Ms. Yellen to lead on an issue that has rocked markets, raised questions about the role of social media in trading and drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers.<br />Thursday’s gathering will involve officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</td>

Early seed sales to North American farmers and fall pesticide spraying helped Corteva deliver a small profit for the fourth quarter, which analysts had anticipated to show a loss.<br />The Delaware-based farm supplier is under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP. The firm in January launched an effort to oust Corteva’s chief executive, Jim Collins, and replace most of the company’s board of directors. Starboard said Corteva’s profits have been stagnant and that Mr. Collins hasn’t acted decisively to change that.<br />Corteva’s board has stood behind Mr. Collins. The board in January acknowledged the company can improve its performance for investors, and is making progress, but said Starboard hadn’t offered specifics.<br />“We’re at a real inflection point,” Mr. Collins said in an interview. “There’s a lot of good work that’s gone on over the last few years, that folks don’t appreciate how ready we are to deliver.”</td>

Richard Burr and Sen. Thom Tillis—said Mr. Regan worked effectively with business in his years heading North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality.<br />“I’ve spent a lot of time talking to people in North Carolina, people in the agriculture sector, people in the energy sector—and what they all said is Michael distinguished himself as somebody who listens,” Mr. Tillis said. “I do believe he will be somebody that we can rely on to be fair.”<br />The EPA is often at the center of rifts between Republicans and Democrats, but the comments from the Republican senators and a generally friendly confirmation hearing suggested he is on a path to Senate approval. The committee didn’t take a vote Wednesday.</td>

The company has said in court papers that Ms. Coscarelli’s request could derail the chain’s sale process and wreak havoc on the ability of its bankruptcy case to move forward.<br />BC Hospitality Group filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December to ease a sale of the restaurant business, which has about a dozen corporate-owned locations, after it faced a cash crunch brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The company, partially owned by investment firm Bain Capital LP, has scheduled an auction for the chain on March 1, if necessary. Both sides want the issue to be resolved in advance of a hearing on March 4 for the judge to consider approving a winning bidder and to confirm BC Hospitality Group’s proposed bankruptcy plan.</td>

      <td>International law has no remedy for property crimes a government against its own citizens, a unanimous court rules</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court stopped Holocaust victims and their descendants from seeking compensation in U.S. courts for property allegedly seized by Nazi Germany and its ally Hungary, ruling Wednesday that international law provides no remedy for property crimes a government commits against its own citizens.<br />The unanimous court acted in two separate suits over different types of property. One involved the Guelph Treasure, a collection of medieval German relics that Nazi leader Hermann Goering allegedly coerced a consortium of Jewish art dealers to sell in the 1930s at a third of its value. The other suit involved the Hungarian state railway MAV, which allegedly stripped Jews of their personal possessions before forcibly transporting them to Nazi death camps during World War II.<br />Foreign governments generally are immune from lawsuits in American courts, but Congress has created several exceptions. A federal appeals court in Washington found the Holocaust cases qualified, because the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act permits suits over “property taken in violation of international law.”<br />Because genocide violates international law, property taken from Jews as the Nazi extermination campaign progressed could be recovered in U.S. courts, the appellate court reasoned.<br />At the high court, however, writing in the lead case, Germany v. Philipp, Chief Justice John Roberts said the appeals panel had misconstrued the meaning of that exception. Rather than applying to property taken during the violation of international law, he wrote, the exception covered only a property taking that itself violated international law—that is, when a government illegally seizes the property of another country’s citizen.</td>

      <td>Biden wants to dole out checks and create new programs, not find a compromise.</td>
      <td>White House press secretary Jen Psaki was precise and pointed Monday as she dismissed efforts by 10 Republican senators to forge a compromise with President Biden on his $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. Following the senators’ meeting with Mr. Biden, she defended the president’s stimulus plan as “carefully designed” and focused on “pressing needs.” The president “will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment,” she concluded.<br />The administration’s package was neither “carefully designed” nor focused only on “pressing needs.” It’s a mishmash of the good, the bad and the in-between, tilted toward delivering cash to blue states and putting in place permanent big-government programs under the guise of temporary emergency measures.<br />Take stimulus checks. Mr. Biden would spend $465 billion on $1,400 checks, Republicans $220 billion on $1,000 checks. Two-earner couples with lots of children making up to $300,000 a year can get Biden checks, as can college students, spouses who are illegal aliens, and other adult dependents excluded from previous rounds of checks.<br />Republicans would focus on the truly needy, phasing out checks for individuals making more than $50,000 a year and couples making more than $100,000. Their approach recognizes that most people added to savings or paid down debt with previous checks and didn’t stimulate the economy by spending them.<br />In criticizing the GOP approach, an unnamed “senior administration official” told Politico that Republicans will “get no credit” when the larger Democratic checks pass, leaving them at a political disadvantage. That’s a bread-and-circuses rationale, not sound public policy.</td>

      <td>Biden officials’ urgency about emissions makes them likely to sacrifice more-important goals.</td>
      <td>President Biden is eager to make climate change a central issue, and he can expect an intense debate. The trade-offs are complicated and the politics are difficult and uncertain. But the biggest challenge may be international, particularly dealing with China, America’s pre-eminent adversary. Does the Biden administration have the slightest idea how to reconcile its global environmental goals with its China strategy?<br />The early signs aren’t encouraging. Right or wrong, climate change wasn’t on President Trump’s priority list for dealing with China. But it is paramount to Mr. Biden. In Beijing’s eyes, this makes Washington the demandeur—in diplomatic parlance, the one asking for something. It is never a preferred position in negotiations. You want China to take action on climate change? asks Xi Jinping. Let’s talk about what you’re going to give to get it.<br />Climate diplomacy czar John Kerry knows he has a problem. Taking his first swing last week, he whiffed. Mr. Kerry told the world, “The stakes on climate change just simply couldn’t be any higher than they are right now. It is existential.” He added that Mr. Biden is “totally seized by this issue.” Asked about handling China, given the many contentious disagreements, Mr. Kerry answered that “those issues will never be traded for anything” relating to climate change, which “is a critical stand-alone issue” that it is “urgent that we find a way to compartmentalize, to move forward.”<br />He didn’t explain how he’d compartmentalize. Nor does former Obama official John Podesta, who recently said that climate change “changes defense posture, it changes foreign policy posture” and “begins to drive a lot of decision making.” He then contradicted himself, urging Mr. Biden to build “a protected lane in which the other issues don’t shut down the conversation on climate change.” Driving down that protected lane will be interesting.<br />Climate adviser Gina McCarthy compounded the confusion, stressing that “we have to start shifting to clean energy, but it has to be manufactured in the United States of America, you know, not in other countries.” Her own words prove that “compartmentalization” is a fantasy. Moreover, she underscored the risk, distinctly present under Mr. Trump, that national security concerns can easily devolve into old-fashioned industrial policy.</td>

      <td>Social media, besides flooding the world with narcissism and malevolence, generates loneliness. How to overcome it?</td>
      <td>Covid is a curse, yet some citizens have prospered during its grim visitation—and not only virtue signalers, sweat-pants merchants and people involved in relocating New Yorkers to Florida.<br />This has also been a golden era for all who take seriously the admonition “there are two types of people in this world: avoid both like the plague.” Recluses, loners and other lovers of solitude are in full glow. Bowling alone is just what the doctor—and governor—ordered. Solitary martinis are the healthy choice. Large social gatherings, including weddings, feasts and funerals, have taken on a slight whiff of sedition.<br />Yet the loneliness that can result from the loss of human interaction constitutes another plague, according to Billy Baker, a staff writer at the Boston Globe. “Name a health condition you don’t want and there’s a study linking it to loneliness,” he writes in “We Need to Hang Out: A Memoir of Making Friends.” “Diabetes. Obesity. Alzheimer’s. Heart disease. Cancer. One study found that in terms of damage to your health, loneliness was the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day.”<br />For some, that’s a small price to pay for skipping church with society’s blessing or declining an invitation to dine with Aunt Madge and Uncle Joe. But Mr. Baker sees a worsening contagion. A 2019 survey found that 61% of Americans are “measurably lonely,” a seven-point jump from the previous year. AARP found that 42 million Americans over 45 suffer from “chronic loneliness,” while Brigham Young University, analyzing data from more than three million people over more than three decades, found that lonely people “saw their risk of premature death rise by up to 32 percent.” We are, Mr. Baker warns, “in the midst of a full-blown loneliness epidemic,” and it was gathering steam well before Covid arrived.<br />Television continues to hypnotize and isolate, he notes; even people between 15 and 44—“the original smartphone junkies”—surrender two hours each day to the one-eyed monster. Social media, besides flooding the world with narcissism and malevolence, generates loneliness. Mr. Baker cites a study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showing that heavy social-media users (more than 50 visits a week) were three times more likely to feel lonely than light users (nine or less). “Each time something new moves online and stops happening face-to-face, we deplete the world’s supply of social capital.”</td>

      <td>‘USA Today confirmed that all of the details of the Instagram post, including the quote, were absolutely correct. Why, then, did it flag it as misleading?’</td>
      <td>From “Lincoln High School and the Latest Fact-Checking Pitfalls” by Kalev Leetrau, RealClearPolitics.com, Feb. 2:<br /><br />On Dec. 16, Not the Bee, which describes itself as a “humor-based news, opinion, and entertainment site,” shared on its Instagram account a photograph of Abraham Lincoln titled “San Francisco to rename ABRAHAM LINCOLN High School because—I swear this is real—‘he did not show that black lives ever mattered to him.’ ” Four days later,  Facebook  fact-checking partner USA Today (which receives funding from Facebook) published a fact check of the post, issuing a verdict that it was “Missing Context.” This means that anyone viewing the Instagram post since then has seen a large red warning label saying, “Missing Context. Independent fact-checkers say information in this post could mislead people.”<br />In its fact check, USA Today confirmed that all of the details of the Instagram post, including the quote, were absolutely correct. Why, then, did it flag it as misleading? In the paper’s words, “It is true that a renaming committee included Abraham Lincoln High School on a list of 44 schools whose namesakes met its renaming criteria. But the committee has not finalized its recommendations, and the school board has not voted on the name changes—so at this time, it’s not accurate to say that the school will be renamed.”</td>

      <td>Rioters looting and taking selfies have nothing on Italy’s ‘Years of Lead.’</td>
      <td>Fears of insurrection have been in the air, first with last summer’s left-wing attacks on police stations, courthouses and similar facilities, then with the right-wing riot at the U.S. Capitol last month. But Italians have seen far worse. The “Years of Lead” between 1969 and 1988 saw hundreds killed in violence from both the left and right.<br />The far left at the time was represented most prominently by the Red Brigades, whose acts of terrorism included kidnappings and murders of political opponents and supporters who deviated from orthodoxy. These attacks were carefully premeditated and politically motivated. In 1978 the Red Brigades kidnapped, held hostage and murdered former Prime Minister Aldo Moro because he was mediating a coalition between his party, Christian Democracy, and the Communist Party. The Red Brigades wanted revolution, not compromise or an establishment party. It’s a far cry from antifa and Black Lives Matter supporters looting stores, burning buildings and attacking policemen indiscriminately.<br />The Italian far right was represented by dispersed and disorganized neofascist groups that rebranded after World War II. They favored bombings, most notably the massacres at Milan’s Piazza Fontana in 1969 by the New Order, which killed 17, and at Bologna’s Central Station in 1980 by the Revolutionary Armed Nucleus, which killed 85. Again, a stark difference from Trump supporters storming the Capitol wearing funny clothes, taking selfies and, like their leftist counterparts, indiscriminately attacking law enforcement.<br />All told, hundreds of innocent people were killed and many more wounded during Italy’s Years of Lead. Conspiracy theories were common. The “strategy of tension,” which imagined the state intelligence apparatus and the Central Intelligence Agency worked with the far right to cause instability that could be blamed on Communists, was popular on the left. Anti-American sentiment was rampant; the Red Brigades assassinated U.S. diplomat Leamon Hunt, who headed an international peacekeeping force, in 1984. The Italian Communist Party received funding and logistical support from the Soviets.<br />“None of this exists in the so-called insurgencies in America,” says historian Lorenzo Castellani of LUISS University of Rome. “They are very different phenomena.” Terrorism in Italy had well-defined ideological foundations and structured paramilitaries. America’s “culture wars” are largely fought between internet subcultures and personality cults formed by atomized individuals who commit disturbing but futile acts of performative violence.</td>

      <td>The Petersen Automotive Museum showcases sports cars of the uberwealthy—sports cars from Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini and more.</td>
      <td>The centerpieces of “Supercars,” the Petersen Automotive Museum’s new online video tour of an exhibit that can’t be viewed in person because of Covid-19, are the 1988 Lamborghini Countach 5000QV as well as a stable of Ferraris that defined the category from the 1950s to today. That’s as it should be. Those were the cars whose images adorned the bedroom walls of teenage boys starting in the 1960s and ’70s, usually with a bikini-clad supermodel splayed across the hood. But as this overview makes clear, covering some 30 automobiles spread across the entire 14,000 square feet of the museum’s third floor, there is much more to the history and development of so-called supercars.<br />Michael Bodell, the museum’s deputy director, is our guide (the show was curated by Exhibitions Director Bryan Stevens), and he reminds us that these playthings of the uberwealthy and well-connected have a long history. We see the 1913 Mercer Type 35-J Raceabout, which competed in the first Indianapolis 500, and the 1923 Mercedes 28/95 Targa-Florio, its high hood-line hiding what was, at the time, Mercedes’s most powerful automotive engine, adapted from aircraft technology—a 7.2-liter, inline six-cylinder that produced about 95 horsepower. While these cars may not make us think of the Lamborghinis or Ferraris to come, most of America at that time was driving Henry Ford’s boxy Model T, early models of which had 2.9-liter, inline four-cylinder engines that produced only 20 horsepower.<br />The Art Deco period’s marriage of design and function is clearly evident in the next two vehicles in the virtual tour, the 1933 Duesenberg Model SJ, an ultra-luxurious long-nosed convertible coupe popular with Hollywood celebrities of the day that put out more than 300 horsepower and had a top speed of over 130 miles per hour. While someone may have driven this car that fast, that wasn’t the purpose of buying one. Rather, it was to be seen in it—leaving onlookers agog at the silver-wrapped exhaust manifolds, spoke wheels and the distinctive flying-goddess hood ornament.<br />Art Deco’s influence is even more evident in the 1938 Delahaye 145 with a custom body by French coachbuilder Henri Chapron. One of four Delahaye Grand Prix cars, it’s really a race car whose bodywork makes it road-worthy and head-turning, with rounded, sculpted fenders, streamlined hood and sloping tail, all in an elegant blue and purple two-tone finish.<br />Where we really get into modern-day supercars is the 1952 Ferrari 212/225 Inter Spyder Barchetta, originally owned by Henry Ford II; he took it to his designers, who were inspired to create the 1950s Thunderbirds. One of the few all-original cars in the museum’s collection, it has a staid black finish with white interior and whitewall tires. Its sleek, rounded edges and open cockpit are so far removed from the top-selling American car of 1952, the Buick Roadmaster, that the two shouldn’t be discussed in the same sentence.</td>

Which it was, to a degree. But it also was a trade that pitted professionals against other professionals—and few have made more money than Senvest Management LLC, Messrs. Mashaal’s and Gonick’s firm.<br />“When it started its march, we thought, something’s percolating here,” said Mr. Mashaal, 55 years old. “But we had no idea how crazy this thing was going to get.”<br />Senvest’s interest in the videogame retailer was piqued by a presentation from the new GameStop chief executive at a consumer investment conference in January 2020.</td>

      <td>German conglomerate strikes agreement with plaintiffs’ attorneys for a $2 billion compensation program for future claims</td>
      <td>Bayer AG  is trying again to contain its liability over claims that its popular Roundup weedkiller causes cancer, unveiling Wednesday a $2 billion proposal to pay farmers and gardeners who try to blame the company for illnesses in the future.<br />The German company and plaintiffs’ lawyers said they would seek a U.S. District Court judge’s permission for a compensation program that would pay between around $5,000 and $200,000 each to future plaintiffs who contract non-Hodgkin lymphoma after using Roundup.<br />Bayer has been battling litigation over Roundup’s safety since acquiring Monsanto Co., the weedkiller’s manufacturer, in 2018. After three California juries found in favor of sick plaintiffs, Bayer agreed last June to pay up to $9.6 billion to settle existing Roundup cases. It continues to deny any link between the product and cancer.<br />That deal, however, didn’t prevent more plaintiffs from coming forward in the future. An earlier proposal to create a panel of scientific experts whose conclusions on Roundup’s safety would bind future litigants didn’t pass muster with a federal judge, and Bayer has been working with plaintiffs’ lawyers since July on a revision.<br />The new proposed class action covers those who haven’t yet hired a lawyer to pursue a Roundup claim. If approved by the court, individuals who believe Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin lymphoma can apply for a settlement from a $1.33 billion pot of money, with the offers dependent on age, health, proof of Roundup use and other factors. Those who opt out can still pursue litigation on their own, with the prospect of convincing a jury to award higher, punitive damages not available to class members. The settlement fund will last four years, with the option to extend it after that.</td>

Eric Simonoff, Mr. Mezrich’s agent, said the publisher made a pre-emptive bid for the book, preventing it from going to auction.<br />At least four book proposals—including Mr. Mezrich’s—are either being circulated to publishers or in the works, according to people familiar with the matter. The interest is a reflection of the widespread fascination created after GameStop shares were bid up well beyond logical measure by investors who followed the stock on social network Reddit and other platforms.<br />The movie rights to Mr. Mezrich’s proposal, titled “The Antisocial Network,” had previously been acquired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. earlier this week.</td>

But they also underscored the power that a 50-50 Senate grants individual senators. Mr. Manchin is still seeking more-targeted aid payments and a smaller increase in the federal minimum wage than what Mr. Biden proposed.<br />Mr. Manchin said he is still talking with Republicans, and that he wanted the process to be bipartisan, including giving both parties the chance to amend the legislation.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday that there will be an “open, bipartisan amendment process” as the chamber debates Democrats’ budget resolution over the next two days. He invited Republicans to participate. But he reiterated his party is committed to passing a big rescue package quickly.</td>

Radio stations and streaming services stopped promoting his music and other artists including Maren Morris, Jason Isbell and Mickey Guyton criticized him on social media.<br />Mr. Wallen has publicly apologized, saying, “I’m embarrassed and sorry. I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back.”<br />The distancing by his label, radio and streaming services pumps the brakes on what was a rocketing career for the country artist that many industry executives saw as poised to break through to a wider audience. Mr. Wallen is scheduled to tour this summer, but without the backing of many key industry players, his future career is in question.  Live Nation Entertainment Inc.,  his concert promoter, hasn’t responded to a request for comment.<br />“I won’t be surprised if he loses most of the slots on some festivals, if they should actually occur this year or next,” said Nashville-based entertainment attorney and artist manager Zach Scott Gainous. Such contracts “likely allow for cancellation for so-called ‘immoral’ behavior,” he said.</td>

A number of lower court decisions have gone against the government in the energy sector, and the Supreme Court had stopped the government from lowering the salaries of senior officials at autonomous institutions such as the central bank.<br />Wednesday’s ruling by a 4-1 vote knocks down key aspects of a policy published last year by the Energy Ministry that required the national power grid operator to take electricity generated by CFE before cheaper options from private generators that have invested billions of dollars in the country, especially in wind and solar stations. The ministry argued that the change was necessary to ensure network reliability.</td>

Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos were more harshly treated.<br />In our filing with Judge Boasberg, we pointed out how attorney Alex van der Zwaan, the first person sentenced in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, also pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement. Like Mr. Clinesmith, he asked for probation as a first offender and because his wife, too, was pregnant with their first child. Judge Amy Berman Jackson would hear none of it. In imposing a 30-day sentence, she said some prison time was necessary for both punishment and deterrent purposes: “It’s a message that needs to be sent, especially given the fact that you’re an attorney.”<br />Mr. Clinesmith wasn’t just an attorney, but one who held a public trust as an FBI attorney responsible for providing intelligence information to the FISA court that Judge Boasberg heads.

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats said they would hold a vote Thursday to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.) from her committees over her past incendiary remarks and social-media posts, ratcheting up pressure on House Republicans wrestling with whether to take disciplinary action.<br />The intensifying fight over the freshman lawmaker converged Wednesday with an effort to topple House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming after she voted to impeach former President Donald Trump. The two developments, set to be discussed at a House GOP meeting in the afternoon, highlighted the fierce infighting roiling the Republican Party as it seeks to define itself after Mr. Trump’s loss.<br />After weeks of withholding judgment, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) will be forced to make a decision Wednesday on whether to strip committee assignments from Mrs. Greene, a Trump loyalist who has been condemned on both sides of the aisle for embracing conspiracy theories. Democrats said the House will vote Thursday to remove her from the committees if Mr. McCarthy doesn’t act first.<br />At the same time, he will also referee an effort from some lawmakers to demote Ms. Cheney, the only member of GOP leadership to vote to impeach Mr. Trump last month on allegations that he incited the violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />Mr. McCarthy ascended to power on his ability to forge strong relationships, including with Mr. Trump. His decisions Wednesday will almost certainly leave some faction of the House GOP unhappy and complicate his ambitions of becoming speaker if the GOP reclaims the House next year.</td>

      <td>Marble? Corian? Quartzite? We consulted interior designers to match countertop substances with personality types. Find yourself, and your next kitchen here.</td>
      <td>WE ASK A LOT of our kitchen countertops. We gather around them, work at them, prep food on them, eat on them—and these days we also seem to think our counters should say something about us. So, given the kaleidoscopic array of options on the market, how do you know which material suits you? In kitchen design as in all relationships it comes down to compatibility. Pride yourself on hard-nosed practicality? You’ll likely love clean, indestructible quartzite. Millennial fashionista? Terrazzo beckons. We asked a few of our favorite design experts to play matchmaker with a varied lineup of countertop materials, personalities and budgets. Here’s what shook out.<br />Want to avoid the hefty install costs that come with materials like marble? Tile countertops (from $10 a square foot) can be a smart workaround, said Beth Dotolo of Seattle-based Pulp Design Studios. But beware: Grout gets grimy fast. For a refined, durable look, opt for large-format tile that’s been rectified to avoid large grout lines. Houston designer Marie Flanigan, who just completed an island using 12-inch-by-24-inch reclaimed limestone tiles, concurred. “People think of those clunky 4-inch squares we grew up with,” she said, “but if you choose wisely, tile can get you the beauty of natural stone without the price tag of a slab.”<br />For a sleek, midcentury look, stainless steel countertops (from $55 a square foot) are New York kitchen-cabinetry designer Christopher Peacock’s choice. They require custom fabrication, so they’re not a budget option—but besides Machine Age good looks, they have a lot to recommend them. They’re germ-resistant, easy to clean and impervious to stains and rust.<br />When it’s perfectly seamless simplicity you’re after, man-made, “solid surface” workhorses like Corian (from $40 a square foot) are hard to beat, said Marianne Brown of Salt Lake City’s W Design Collective. “If I’m using Corian, I always stick to solid colors and straight lines, because decorative edges can definitely make it look dated,” she added. Another nifty trick? Match the color of your countertop to your cabinets for a sleek monochromatic effect.<br />Do even the tiniest blemishes make you hyperventilate? Quartzite counters (from $50 to over $200 a square foot) could be the answer. Slabs of it come in a range of hues, from brown to blue to bright white, and include all kinds of movement veining. “Quartzite is the most durable natural stone, harder than granite, so we use it all the time when a client needs something heat- and scratch-resistant and nearly indestructible,” said Ms. Flanigan.”</td>

It is about controlling violent activities of ideologically-motivated extremism.”<br />Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, said the decision was unjustified and demonstrated heavy-handedness from Canada’s Liberal government.</td>

      <td>On the movie calendar pretzeled by the pandemic, February is the new December—the last month for movies to qualify for the Academy Awards. With the Oscars telecast pushed to its latest date ever (April 25), a normally sleepy month for new releases brings a cluster of films trying to slingshot into the big game.<br />Some of them are already in the running for other awards, including “Nomadland,” “The Father” and “Judas and the Black Messiah,” all nominated Wednesday for Golden Globe Awards. (That ceremony is scheduled for Feb. 28, more than a month later than usual.)<br />The February blitz has repercussions for everyday film fans, too. Instead of the typical incremental release starting “in select theaters,” most awards contenders are also dropping in living rooms around the same time for on-demand viewing. The hard part is keeping track of all the variations of when, where and how to see them.<br />Even for Hollywood, it’s been a challenge to monitor a playing field reshaped by theater closures and awards organizations responding to Covid.<br />“It’s been a long run of the award-type films, starting in late summer through now. From that standpoint, it sure feels like we’re still in 2020,” says Pam Williams, a producer of “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” about the feds’ targeting of the jazz legend, played by Andra Day. Director Lee Daniels made it for the big screen, shooting it on film in 2019. But the plan for a theatrical release through Paramount Pictures changed when Hulu bought the film for an exclusive U.S. release.</td>

      <td>Strong cash flow from recovered ad business underwrites steep cloud losses</td>
      <td>The irony of Google shining more light on its cloud business is that the move proved just how much the internet giant still needs its advertising machine.<br />And what a machine it is. Parent company  Alphabet  Inc.’s  fourth-quarter results late Tuesday showed that advertising revenue surged 22% year over year to a record $46.2 billion. That was 9% higher than the already strong advertising recovery Wall Street had been expecting following an unprecedented dip in the first half of 2020, which was caused by the pandemic’s damage to major industries such as travel that are big Google ad buyers. The company said Tuesday that the recovery was fueled both by brand and direct-response advertising; YouTube advertising alone surged 46% year over year to about $6.9 billion.<br />Advertising turned out to be the bright light in a quarter that also included the company’s first disclosure of its cloud profits, or rather the lack thereof. Google Cloud grew 46% last year by generating nearly $13.1 billion in revenue. But it also lost $5.6 billion, and has run operating losses for the past three years. That may have been in line with previous signals from the company about the scale of its investment in the business, but it still took many by surprise. Michael Levine of Pivotal Research called the losses “fairly shocking” in a note to clients.  Amazon.com ’s  AWS division was generating about $3.4 billion a year in operating profit when at a similar revenue level.<br />But investors quickly got over the sticker shock. Alphabet’s stock price surged nearly 9% by Wednesday afternoon to a record. As it turns out, the company’s decision to break out Google Cloud as its own segment showcased just how strong its ad business is. Under the new reporting structure, the segment called Google Services that includes advertising showed an operating margin of 32% for 2020. That is 7 percentage points higher than the operating margin reported for the core Google business in 2019 when that core segment included both advertising and the cloud operations.<br />Analysts largely gave Google a pass on the steep cloud losses, projecting that the business will eventually scale to a healthy bottom line. The company itself noted that its backlog for the cloud business jumped to $30 billion by the end of the quarter compared with $19 billion just three months prior. And despite its reputation for big spending, Alphabet’s capital expenditures have actually declined for two years in a row now, leading to record free cash flow of $42.8 billion in 2020. Google may be playing an expensive game of catch-up in the cloud, but it at least has the means to run the race.</td>

      <td>Trimming hair at home—be it yours, your partner’s or your squirming child’s—can easily result in disaster. Here, expert advice on how to masterfully shear the whole family.</td>
      <td>THE SKILL that matters most when you’re attempting to cut your hair at home is not point-cutting—i.e., chipping into ends with the tip of the scissors while holding them vertically to create texture. It’s not beveling—i.e., rounding out the angles of a razor cut.<br />It’s restraint. When cuts go awry, it’s usually because people can’t resist trimming just a bit more or refuse to leave the hard-to-reach back of their heads alone, said Ana Costa, a hairstylist at Papillon Jaune Salon in Providence, R.I. But the odds of creating non-cringe-y results vastly increase if you equip yourself with the right tools: that is, ones you’re actually qualified to use. “Don’t buy anything that requires a license,” said Ms. Costa. Basic shearing scissors, a comb and clips will do. Don’t overcomplicate things, either. Work in sections, which is tedious but effective, and set realistic expectations (Vidal Sassoon didn’t master the bob before breakfast). Here, the best techniques to try on yourself, kids and partners for cuts that look sharp from all angles.<br />On yourself: Start with dry or damp hair so you have an accurate sense of the length and don’t inadvertently change the geometry of your cut. Just clean up the lines. If you have bangs, start by trimming them: Gather the bangs and twist them into a section above your nose. Snip into the ends, first straight across and then vertically to achieve soft edges. Don’t cut bangs beyond the outer edges of your eyebrows, said Ms. Costa. To banish split ends around your face, run your comb (Ms. Costa prefers Krest’s fine-tooth models, from $6, amazon.com) through your hair, stopping ½ inch from the bottom, and snip the frayed bits. If you insist on trimming the back of your mane solo, it’s possible, but only if your hair is longer than shoulder length. Part it in the middle and pull the sections forward so the tips lie flat on your chest. Point-cut up into the ends—this results in a symmetrical V-shape, said Amy Abramite, a hairstylist at Maxine Salon in Chicago.<br />On someone else:Arm yourself with sectioning clips (Ms. Costa’s favorites are Framar Gator Grip Clips, $9 for four, framar.com) so you clearly see the areas you need to cut (front, back, sides). Good lighting also helps, so sit your “client” near a window. Starting at the nape and moving forward, release a one-inch section and trim it to the desired length—this initial cut will serve as a guide to measure all others against. “I’d advise taking off no more than ½ inch at first,” said Ms. Costa. “You can always do more later.” To avoid a (literal) square haircut, snip the ends around the face on a slight angle, holding your comb at 45-degrees and cutting along it as a guide. To avoid conjuring a Picasso, pull pieces under the chin to ensure they’re even lengths. Adjust as needed.<br />On yourself: Grab a pair of scissors and a modest clipper: “Using scissors longer than 5 1/2 inches is like cutting hair with a sword,” said Ms. Abramite. For a simple, neatly shorn cut, start buzzing with the standard number-four guard, staying below the occipital bone (where your head starts to curve). Tackle the top section with scissors: Pull small, ½-inch sections between your pointer and middle fingers and slide the hair straight up, then notch into the ends with your scissors pointed down to remove bulk. Lastly, take off the guard and buzz carefully around the perimeter of your head and neck to tidy up any scruffy strands.</td>

A new survey in the Golden State suggests that his November party in defiance of pandemic protocols at the acclaimed French Laundry restaurant was even more expensive than it seemed.<br />The elections of 2020 clarified that no one should expect political polls to express mathematical precision.

James Pogue writes:<br />Covid lockdowns have been brutal for those Californians who can’t afford to dine at a celebrated Napa eatery. The state’s unemployment rate is now more than two full percentage points higher than the national average.<br />The Berkeley poll doesn’t find that the reliably Democratic state is quite ready to fire Mr. Newsom.

State Assemblyman Phil Steck, an Albany-area Democrat who supports a stock-transfer tax, said any impact on individual investors would be minuscule compared with the positive effects of additional state spending on infrastructure.</td>

      <td>Like today, policy makers of the 1960s had bigger worries than prices. Then a spike crushed the economy.</td>
      <td>There is a long history of high budget deficits being associated with inflation, and Washington’s current profligate spending and the Federal Reserve’s expansive monetary policy may be pushing the U.S. down that path. In the U.S. and world-wide, the link between deficits and inflation has been most apparent during wartime, as the fiscal burdens of combat spur central banks into inflationary financing. But there are also peacetime instances. Now, after a decade of modest inflation that has made many expect it will always stay low, a rise in inflation may come as a surprise.<br />Sounding the alarm about inflation is out of vogue. Skeptics point out that high deficit spending, zero interest rates and unprecedented quantitative easing didn’t spur inflation in the decade after the 2008-09 financial crisis. That experience has left a strong impression on makers of monetary and fiscal policy.<br />But the government response to the pandemic is dwarfing the actions that followed the financial crisis. Fiscal initiatives since last March have already authorized deficit spending equal to 17% of gross domestic product. Generous government transfers to individuals and businesses have supported household incomes and will stimulate aggregate demand for years to come. President Biden now proposes additional deficit spending equal to roughly 9% of GDP. These total deficit increases are magnitudes larger than President Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.<br />Combined with the Fed’s expansive monetary policy, the government’s income supports have generated a surge in money supply and excess household savings. Even before the latest Treasury distribution of $600 checks, much less the new round of checks Mr. Biden proposes, personal savings were an estimated $1.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels. That contrasts sharply with the Fed’s post-financial-crisis quantitative-easing programs, which only generated excess reserves that sloshed around between big banks and the Fed and were never put directly to work in the economy. The widespread administering of vaccines is now set to release the constraints of the pandemic and unleash the unprecedented pipeline of fiscal and monetary stimulus.<br />A few episodes from history stand out as parallels. After World War II, concerns that aggregate demand would slump and the economy would shrink led the Treasury to pressure the Fed to maintain its artificially low interest-rate pegs. Contrary to expectations, a surge of pent up household savings and massive Fed liquidity resulted in strong economic growth, and inflation—up to 15% a year by 1948.</td>

It’s time for a new U.S. policy that promotes regional peace, advances Palestinian human rights and defends the U.S. taxpayer.<br />History can explain, in part, how this mess was created. In 1948, five Arab armies invaded the fledgling state of Israel but lost. Unrwa was established to care for Arab residents displaced by that conflict. The organization was dedicated solely to Palestinian Arabs—independent of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which took responsibility for all other world refugee populations.<br />Unrwa became part of a new Arab narrative: Millions of Palestinians were trapped as refugees, living in destitution and yearning for home. Until these people achieved their “right of return,” the Arab world insisted, the Middle East would never see peace. Meanwhile, Israel absorbed 800,000 Jewish refugees who were exiled from Arab states.<br />Over time, America somehow allowed itself to become Unrwa’s leading donor. From 1950 to 2018, American taxpayers contributed more than $6 billion, even as legislators from both parties raised concerns about the agency. Employees moonlighted as terrorists. Schools were used to store weapons and launch rockets against Israel. Concerns in Congress mounted over waste, fraud and abuse.</td>

      <td>The GameStop mania highlighted the downside of free trading for brokerages like Robinhood, though large diversified firms can still benefit</td>
      <td>Free trading has been a boon to online brokers, banks, investment advisers and fintech upstarts. But if frenzies like this keep up, it may prove to be costly, too.<br />A surge of activity in 2020 helped set trading-volume records for many brokers and collectively brought millions of new accounts, driven by a surprisingly buoyant market and the widespread adoption of commission-free trading. But this past week’s frenzy around  GameStop  and other stocks highlighted some potential downsides of this small-trader wave.<br />Moves by some trading platforms including Robinhood Markets to restrict some trading at times drew huge scrutiny from customers and politicians. Even shares of far bigger firms, such Charles Schwab, which now also owns TD Ameritrade, and  Morgan Stanley ,  which now owns E*Trade, were sold off sharply last week.<br />Those shares have rallied so far this week. But the question investors may be considering is whether a sustained explosion of trading is ultimately good for the online-trading business.<br />From a revenue standpoint, the absence of commissions and little return on customer cash due to superlow interest rates increases reliance on other revenue sources, like margin lending and payment-for-order flow. So called PFOF in particular, which involves sending customers’ trading orders to wholesale market-making firms, has drawn huge attention over the past week. Whether warranted or not, regulatory changes or customer demands that limit this revenue source could make volume much less valuable.</td>

It also plans to eventually make Mercedes-Benz the name of the car-making business, which in future would focus on developing luxury electric cars and automotive software.<br />Investors applauded the news, driving Daimler’s shares up nearly 9% in trading in Frankfurt.<br />Echoing arguments that investors have made for years, Daimler’s top executive, Ola Källenius, said the two vehicle businesses were quite distinct, with different customers, technologies and financial requirements.<br />“Both companies operate in industries that are facing major technological and structural changes. Given this context, we believe they will be able to operate most effectively as independent entities,” Mr. Källenius said.</td>

Prosecutors said the men routed the funds through shell companies and a nonprofit.<br />On his final day in office last month, Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Bannon as part of a flurry of pardons and commutations. The White House said Mr. Bannon “has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen.” That pardon applied only to alleged federal crimes, not state charges.<br />The investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., a Democrat, is in its early stages, the people said. It couldn’t be determined if Manhattan prosecutors were investigating the same circumstances that underpinned the federal investigation.<br />For local prosecutors to gain access to information presented to a federal grand jury, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York would have to request an order from a federal judge. There is no indication a judge has granted such an order.</td>

      <td>BLAME ILL-BEHAVED pooches (or their owners) and an absurd parade of “emotional support” chickens and “comfort” tarantulas. As of January 2021, the Department of Transportation (DOT) began cracking down, limiting the types of furry companions allowed to fly in airline cabins free of charge. There is now only one acceptable candidate: a service animal. A service animal is not a pet; it’s a dog, highly and specifically trained to aid an “individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability,” according to the DOT. Official documentation is required in advance of travel. Other pets can still fly in the cabin on most U.S. airlines—including Alaska Airlines and  JetBlue —but for a fee (in the $125 range, each way) and only if they fit in a carrier under the seat. Rules vary but that generally disqualifies all animals but those about 25 pounds or under. If Spot is a healthy, 70-pound Dalmatian, cargo is an option, and some airlines like Delta have stepped up, with climate-controlled hold areas for live animals, specially trained personnel and strict weather guidelines. But before you book (well in advance) and load him into a hard-sided crate, check with your vet.</td>

That’s the same time as last year and every year for the last decade.<br />The last time the Super Bowl wasn’t at 6:30 p.m. was in the distant time of 2010, before a radical shift brought it to its current slot. That year, the game was at 6:25 p.m., five minutes earlier than 6:30 p.m. In 2009, it was at 6 p.m. In 2008, it was at 6:17 p.m. On four occasions, it was even at 6:18 p.m. The NFL has dabbled in much experimentation during the six o’clock hour before finding the comfort of 6:30 p.m.<br />There are, however, some things about the big game that vary from year to year. That’s especially true in 2021 for an event that will look like never before with the country in the throes of a global pandemic. So here’s your quick guide to everything about the 55th Super Bowl, otherwise known as Super Bowl LV.<br />The Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That’s especially exciting because of the teams’ two quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady—the last two to win the Super Bowl.<br />Mahomes led the Chiefs to last year’s title. Brady has won six and this will be his 10th Super Bowl appearance. But the previous nine came with the New England Patriots, the team he left after last season. It’s a generational battle between the 43-year-old Brady and the 25-year-old Mahomes. One is toward the end of an all-time career. The other is at the beginning of one.</td>

      <td>In survey of almost 10,000 respondents, many small companies said continued government aid is key to their survival</td>
      <td>America’s small businesses remain under stress from coronavirus pandemic disruptions, and many of them say continued government support is crucial to their survival, according to a new report from the Federal Reserve’s 12 regional banks released on Wednesday.<br />Just under 90% of companies surveyed by the Fed banks said business had not returned to pre-pandemic levels almost a year after the crisis began. Of those that lost ground, 30% said that without more government aid, their companies might not survive, the report said.<br />The survey, an annual project that tallied nearly 10,000 respondents from firms with 500 or fewer employees, found that almost all small firms reported some negative impact from the pandemic, with 78% reporting a drop in income and just under half cutting their workforce in response to reduced demand. Just over half of the firms said revenue for last year is likely to have fallen by more than 25%. The survey was carried out in October and November.<br />The Fed noted in the report that while it surveyed conditions among small businesses, it is those businesses that represent 99.7% of all employers. The report arrives as the Biden administration and Congress are debating another round of economic stimulus to help the economy navigate and escape the effects of the pandemic, which has had a withering impact on business and hiring, both in the United States and in other nations.<br />The Fed is itself providing significant support via ultra low rates and bond-buying efforts aimed at keeping the cost of credit low. Emergency lending programs offered by the Fed, which in many cases saw relatively light usage, have been curtailed. The Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, however, has been relaunched.</td>

He will also be able to help his successor, Andy Jassy, who has run the company’s booming cloud-computing business, learn and grow in the CEO role, said Peter Crist, chairman of executive recruitment firm Crist Kolder Associates. Amazon said Tuesday that Mr. Bezos would transition out of the CEO seat in the third quarter.<br />Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, told analysts Tuesday that Mr. Bezos would remain involved in what Amazon terms “one-way door” issues—the big, irreversible decisions, such as acquisitions or getting into the grocery business, that can’t be easily undone once they are initiated.<br />“Jeff’s always been involved with that, and that’s where we’ll keep his time focused on,” Mr. Olsavsky said.</td>

As the coronavirus pandemic made this year’s recruiting scramble, chaotic, Clemson even rolled out its own custom video-chat platform—in bright orange, of course—to give its assistants a way to stand out in a sea of Zooms and FaceTimes.<br />It’s one reason why Clemson will again boast one of the nation’s top recruiting classes when the dust settles from National Signing Day on Feb. 3.<br />About seven years ago in the early days of the Swinney era, as Clemson sat on the cusp of unprecedented success, the university realized that in order to take its gridiron performance to the next level, it also had to invest behind the scenes in how it marketed to recruits. Swinney persuaded athletic director Dan Radakovich to add a “director of new media” to the athletic department’s payroll to improve its storytelling chops and hired Jonathan Gantt, then the media coordinator for the Tampa Bay Rays who oversaw the team’s social accounts.</td>

Talks between the two companies are continuing, though a deal isn’t imminent, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Such stock run-ups historically have been uncommon for SPACs, and even after they announce merger targets, their shares rarely jump so significantly. That is because the SPACs are paying what they believe to be a market price for the company they are merging with, so in theory, the shares shouldn’t surge unless they are undervaluing their target company.</td>

In May, when it had confirmed 509 Covid-19 infections and 21 deaths, the government stopped reporting cases to the World Health Organization, after Mr. Magufuli insisted that Tanzania had conquered the pandemic and that test kits showing positive results were faulty.<br />This week, Tanzanian Health Minister Dorothy Gwajima said the country had no intention of importing Covid-19 vaccines, including free doses it could get from the global Covax initiative, which aims to supply shots to poor and middle-income countries.<br />“We are not yet satisfied that those vaccines have been clinically proven safe,” Dr. Gwajima said at a news conference, flanked by unmasked government health officials.<br />The only other African countries that have opted to forgo the free Covax vaccines are Burundi, Eritrea and the island state of Madagascar, according to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which manages the initiative along with the WHO. Other early Covid-19 deniers, such as Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko—who last spring called the coronavirus a “psychosis” that could be fought with vodka, saunas and driving tractors—have since accepted vaccines.</td>

      <td>Jack Grundhofer, who has died at age 82, built U.S. Bancorp into a giant and took heat for slashing costs</td>
      <td>Early in Jack Grundhofer’s 40-year banking career, someone shot a gun at him while he was repossessing a car in Southern California. Later, a kidnapper tied him to a tree in Wisconsin. When he was eliminating jobs at Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. in the early 1990s, newspapers dubbed him “Jack the Ripper.”<br />Mr. Grundhofer, who grew up poor as the son of a bartender in Glendale, Calif., wasn’t easily intimidated. Through a long series of acquisitions, he created what became today’s U.S. Bancorp., the nation’s fifth-largest banking company in terms of assets.<br />He learned early in his career to clamp down on costs. “I’ll do whatever I have to do, however Draconian,” he told The Wall Street Journal in 1993. “Shareholders are looking for someone to protect their livelihood. You have to manage tough to survive.”<br />Mr. Grundhofer died Jan. 24 at his home in Indian Wells, Calif. He was 82. The cause of death was pneumonia, unrelated to Covid-19, his wife, Patti Grundhofer, said.<br />Soon after arriving as the new chief executive at First Bank in 1990, Mr. Grundhofer began eliminating about 20% of the workforce. Stung by criticism of his swift job cuts, he said in a letter to the Journal that he didn’t enjoy firing people. “If we had not been successful in making the tough choices to turn around this company,” he added, “there easily could have been 10,000 people out of work, instead of 2,000.”</td>

      <td>Betting companies, personal care and new stadiums in Los Angeles and Las Vegas drove a 10% increase in sponsorships despite the pandemic</td>
      <td>National Football League teams suffered outbreaks and postponements during the 2020 season, but one thing seemed immune to the coronavirus: the allure of the NFL brand.<br />Sponsors at the league, team and venue level committed a total of $1.62 billion to the NFL during the 2020-21 season that ends with Sunday’s Super Bowl, according to sponsorship consultancy IEG. That amount led the four major North American sports leagues and represented a 10% increase from the previous year, roughly twice the NFL’s typical year-over-year sponsorship growth.<br />The extra growth was driven largely by $55 million in new spending for the naming rights of Las Vegas’s Allegiant Stadium and Los Angeles’s SoFi Stadium. But the NFL and its teams also saw their usual array of sponsors expand to include betting and teeth-straightening companies.<br />“One of the things that sort of prevents disruption is stability,” said Peter Laatz, global managing director at IEG. “And the NFL has always been a model of stability.”<br />The NFL’s sponsorship bump, however, isn’t yet money in the bank. Some sponsors are trying to claw back some cash or stretch out their deals, mainly because of in-stadium crowd restrictions and other Covid-related drags on the value of sponsorships, Laatz said. Most of the brands IEG has spoken with are extending the length of their deals without adding extra payment, he said.</td>

      <td>Company is set to sell Planters to Hormel following years of neglect</td>
      <td>Kraft Heinz is close to fetching a very attractive price for its Planters business. Next, it must use the proceeds wisely.<br />The company might reach a deal to sell the business to  Hormel Foods  as soon as next week for around $3 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.<br />At first glance the nuts category is an attractive one, fitting the contemporary trend toward healthier, protein-based snacks. But it also lends itself to competition and commoditization: private-label brands hold about a one-third share, according to Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar.<br />Compounding the problem has been years of underinvestment in the brand under Kraft Heinz’s old mantra of cost-cutting above all. This left Planters largely confined to plain canned peanuts, while competitors invested in products such as flavored almonds marketed as an alternative to chips. Wells Fargo analyst John Baumgartner estimates that Planters’ market share fell around 7 percentage points to 18% between 2016 and 2019.<br />It appears to be a natural fit for Hormel’s protein-focused portfolio of meats and nut butters, but it might be overpaying. At $3 billion, Planters would be going for around three times 2019 sales, according to Wells Fargo’s Mr. Baumgartner. That would be a similar valuation to  Campbell Soup ’s  acquisition of organic soup brand Pacific Foods in 2017 and  Danone ’s  2016 deal for organic specialist WhiteWave Foods, maker of the Horizon organic milk brand, Mr. Baumgartner notes. But those are both more premium categories with better growth potential.</td>

      <td>The elevation of Andy Jassy to become  Amazon.com Inc.’s  next chief executive of is one of the clearest signs yet that fortunes in the tech industry are increasingly made in the cloud.<br />Mr. Jassy was instrumental in helping to transform the online retailing giant he joined in 1997 into a juggernaut in cloud-computing, the business of renting servers and software to customers largely on a pay-as-you-go model. It is a market that could top $300 billion globally this year, according to research firm  Gartner Inc.,  and pits Amazon against tech giants like  Microsoft Corp.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google.<br />The battle for the cloud is playing out across industries—from videogames and cars to space—and companies large and small.<br />For Amazon, cloud computing has been a booming business that is massively lucrative. Amazon Web Services, or AWS,  generated little more than 10% of Amazon’s total sales in the final quarter of last year but yielded more than half the company’s operating profit in the period. AWS revenue advanced 28% over those three months from the previous year to $12.7 billion, and its operating profit was $3.6 billion.<br />For executives, the cloud is increasingly becoming a stepping-stone at tech companies. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ran the software giant’s cloud business before being elevated to the top job in 2014.  International Business Machines Corp.  last year turned to its cloud chief when it came to naming a new CEO to help revive growth.</td>

      <td>Streaming services again dominated a Hollywood awards season, with the line between films and TV shows blurring for viewers craving entertainment at home as the pandemic kept many cinemas closed.<br />Wednesday morning’s Golden Globe nominations included 42 nods for  Netflix  across film and television, though if last year’s nominations are any guide, that is no guarantee of major wins. Two of the five best motion-picture drama nominees this year were Netflix films: “Mank,” a black-and-white love letter to old Hollywood and “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” about the defendants charged with conspiracy after 1968 protests.<br />Nominations for best motion-picture direction went to three women for the first time, including debut feature filmmakers Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) and Regina King (“One Night in Miami”), along with director Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”). It was a departure from last year, when the Globes were slammed for snubbing women in that high-profile category.<br />Favorites like Chadwick Boseman earned much expected recognition. Mr. Boseman is in contention for best actor in a movie drama for “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” which includes a scene where his character rails against the idea of a merciful God. It would be a posthumous win for the actor, whose death after a private battle with cancer shocked fans last summer.<br />On the TV side, new shows that doubled as pandemic binge fare like “Ted Lasso,” “Lovecraft Country” and “The Flight Attendant,” along with crowd pleasers “The Crown,” “Schitt’s Creek” and “Ozark” from pre-Covid days, emerged as strong contenders by the famously quirky Hollywood Foreign Press Association, whose roughly 90 members do the voting.</td>

The obscure allegation was little more than a means to justify Ms. Suu Kyi’s detention, which shook the country and drew widespread global condemnation, experts and human-rights groups say.<br />The military and police didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />The coup marked a sudden reversal of Myanmar’s fragile transition from military rule to democracy, which began about a decade ago. Myanmar’s military claims elections held in November, which were won by Ms. Suu Kyi’s party in a landslide, were marred by voter fraud. Election officials have denied the claims.</td>

The company counts more than 300 insurers, 25,000 collision-repair facilities, dozens of auto makers and thousands of parts suppliers as its clients. Its technology connects these parties to get claims handled and vehicles repaired after wrecks.<br />The 41-year-old business, majority-owned by private-equity firm Advent International, is part of a wave of companies making their public-market debuts through SPACs rather than traditional initial public offerings. SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, turn the IPO process on its head by going public and raising cash without a business, and then searching for one to combine with.<br />The blank-check company in this case,  Dragoneer Growth Opportunities Corp. , went public in August, raising $690 million.</td>

      <td>Some consumer groups don’t think rates have come down enough</td>
      <td>Car-insurance rates for American vehicle owners fell by nearly 4% on average nationally in 2020 as carriers adjusted prices for reduced traffic volume and other pandemic-related changes in driving patterns, according to Zebra, an insurance price-comparison website.<br />The decline is the first nationally since 2013, Zebra said. In addition to these rate reductions, which take effect for new customers and as existing policies renew, many policyholders received premium refunds of about 15% to 20% a month from insurers in the spring. Back then, stay-at-home directives led to a plunge in nationwide mileage and, in turn, a sharp drop in wrecks.<br />The rate reductions bring the average annual car-insurance bill to $1,483, down 3.9%, Zebra said. Car insurance represents the biggest single line of business for U.S. property-casualty carriers, with $248 billion of annual premium in 2019 paid by consumers, according to trade group Insurance Information Institute.<br />It is unclear if U.S. consumers will applaud the industry cuts.<br />In releasing its annual report on rate trend Wednesday, Zebra noted that many consumers have wondered why their premium bills haven’t dropped more dramatically. Many continue to work from home with their vehicles parked all day.</td>

      <td>Hotels are scrambling. Airports are strategizing. Airlines are creating new apps.<br />Travel companies are rushing to make Covid-19 testing a regular part of international travel—as easy as checking a bag—to stem cancellations and get travelers traveling again.<br />A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention order that requires anyone entering the U.S. to have a Covid-19 test within 72 hours of boarding triggered a massive travel-industry effort to make it easy for guests and passengers to comply. PCR tests and rapid antigen tests satisfy the requirement; rapid antibody tests don’t.<br />The order, announced Jan. 12, led to widespread confusion and cancellations, travel sellers say. Airlines Reporting Corp., which processes tickets sold by travel agencies, says that in December, tickets purchased for domestic trips tracked right with international tickets, both at 40% of 2019 sales. That continued into January, then split after the CDC announcement. By the week ended Sunday, preliminary data show domestic air tickets still close to 40% of the 2019 total, but international tickets fell to only 23% of 2019 sales.<br />“As soon as that announcement went into effect, it felt like last March a little bit. Overnight it just decimated business again,” says Zane Kerby, chief executive of the American Society of Travel Advisors.</td>

      <td>Whether you have $100 or $10,000 to spend, here’s expert advice on the most strategic, single piece of gear to invest in</td>
      <td>WHEN MY GYM closed its doors back in March, I needed to find a way to stay active (and sane) without turning my 700-square-foot condo into an unofficial Equinox outpost. My solution: a single pair of adjustable dumbbells that work for all sorts of strength-building moves, from bench presses to squats, and take up little room in my already cramped closet. But even if you live in a vast ranch house, fitness experts agree, nobody requires a suite of gym-rat gear to get an efficient total-body workout. In many cases, you only have to budget for a single, strategic piece of equipment. (And, no, a Peloton isn’t your only option.) Here, five products you can rely on for multiple fitness needs, whether you’re a taut pauper or someone with more money (and calories) to burn.<br />With a free weight, your muscles only engage while working against gravity. When you use these jumbo rubber bands, your muscles also have to withstand the tension of the loop. That makes them an incredibly flexible tool for improving mobility, stability and muscular strength, according to CrossFit co-founder Lauren Jenai. A typical move: With the band around your calves, assume a squat and shuffle sideways. Made from durable natural latex that doesn’t irritate sweaty skin, Fit Simplify’s set lets you choose from five different levels of stretchiness depending on how much opposition your muscles are ready to face. Plus, unlike a clunky machine, you can easily stash the bands out of sight. ($16, fitsimplify.com)<br />You could steal a $3 jump rope from your daughter—if you’re willing to risk ending up on the floor bound in a jump-rope web. This adult-sized weighted version not only lets you avoid that fate, it adds resistance for a double-whammy of cardio and strength building, said PJ Shirdan, a trainer for the at-home boxing platform FightCamp. The Get Lean comes with interchangeable quarter-pound and half-pound ropes and flexible handles for more comfort. Jumping steadily can take the place of an easy run or ride, or you can vary your speed for a high-intensity workout that burns more calories in less time. ($99, crossrope.com)<br />Hang these adjustable straps from a beam or shut the anchor piece in a door frame. When you place your palms on the handles and push the straps away from you to perform a chest press, for example, it creates an unstable dynamic that your body has to work against to control your movement. As you try to keep your limbs from flailing, your body has to work harder than if it were pushing against solid resistance, said Kenny Santucci, founder of workout program Strong New York. Not only are your working muscles engaged, so are smaller stabilizer muscles that don’t get as much attention. Adjusting your body’s angle (picture moving your feet closer to or further from the door frame) can increase the challenge, he added. The whole system comes down as easy as it goes up, letting you build muscle without marring your home. ($185, trxtraining.com)<br />If you value your decor, you’re unlikely to do a squat jump onto your coffee table. That said, jump (or plyometric) training helps you build speed and power more affordably than many machines allow. This firm foam box can handle up to 450 pounds without tipping you onto the hardwood and comes cloaked in a durable no-slip surface, welcoming punishment in ways furniture can’t. Depending on how you orient the box, you have three heights to choose from, which allows you to create a home workout that includes both jumps and strength-building exercises such as incline push-ups, step-ups and single-leg lunges. Sessions with the Plyo Box leave you with “increased metabolism and fat-burning capacities well after your workout is complete,” said Ms. Jenai. ($150, shopepicfitness.com)</td>

      <td>After the pandemic, budget carriers are expected to grow in more congested markets while keeping costs low. Doing both has proven tricky before.</td>
      <td>For vaccine optimists, there may be no clearer way to bet on the recovery than investing in budget airlines. But much depends on whether these low-cost carriers can remain, well, low cost.<br />This week, Dublin-based  Ryanair  reported fourth-quarter earnings well short of analyst expectations. Last week,  Southwest Airlines  managed to surpass forecasts but issued gloomy guidance for the current quarter. It is still up in the air whether leisure travel can reopen in time for the high-summer season.<br />But investors know that, sooner or later, the exit from the pandemic will play in favor of budget airlines and against their full-service competitors. Short-haul traffic will bounce back before international flights, and corporate travelers will be fewer and more price-conscious.<br />The rub is that the market has already priced a lot of this in: On average, the shares of low-cost carriers are back roughly to where they were a year ago, even though their revenues are only forecast to catch up with pre-pandemic trends around 2025. To meet expectations amid heavy discounting, they will need to come out of the Covid crisis making a lot more money with fewer sales.<br />Which is to say, with structurally lower costs. This is their challenge.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department on Wednesday announced few changes to its regular debt issuance schedule for the current quarter, while emphasizing the government continues to face uncertain and sizable borrowing needs due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The agency intends to maintain the size of nominal coupon auction sizes this quarter, after ramping up auction sizes last year to accommodate a surge in government spending to combat the pandemic and cushion the U.S. economy.<br />“Treasury believes that these changes have created sufficient capacity to address near-term projected borrowing needs,” said Brian Smith, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, in a statement on the agency’s quarterly borrowing needs.<br />The Treasury also will continue to gradually increase auction sizes for Treasury inflation-protected securities, as announced in November, boosting the size of those auctions by $10 billion to $20 billion over the 2021 calendar year.<br />The borrowing plans are consistent with expectations from the vast majority of primary dealers and recommendations from a Treasury borrowing advisory committee, a senior Treasury official said Wednesday morning. The plans also preserve flexibility for Treasury, in light of potential uncertainty about government spending and the possibility for another economic relief package in Congress, the official said.</td>

      <td>Nail experts and a clinical psychologist offer actionable tips for quitting—as do two of our manicure-mangling fashion editors</td>
      <td>BITING YOUR nails can be absorbingly compulsive, but it’s an incredibly dirty habit—even more so when absentmindedly sticking unwashed fingers in your mouth could increase your chances of contracting Covid-19. If the threat of a potentially deadly virus won’t make you stop gnawing, what will? For starters, you need to look at nail-biting as more than a “pesky habit,” said Dr. Rebecca Rialon Berry, Ph.D., a New York clinical psychologist.<br />Often accompanied by a desire to chew on your cuticles and hangnails (which, counterintuitively, aren’t nails at all but rather rough bits of dry skin), nail-biting is a body-focused repetitive behavior that helps us cope with anxiety, stress and boredom. Thanks to the many sensory receptors in the fingertips, ruining your manicure provides comfort, focus or both. Identify your triggers: Do work deadlines make you bite, or are nosy inlaws driving you to nibble? Then “get some physical and psychological space” from these triggers, advised Dr. Berry, and work on taking the edge off.<br />As alternative ways to relieve stress, masochists could try grueling physical activities like push-ups, while zen-seekers should regularly take deep breaths. If you’re too rattled to inhale intensely, hold ice cubes. Ice gripping can regulate your temperature and, in turn, your emotions, leaving you better equipped to take deep, calming breaths and leave your nails alone.<br />If these techniques don’t break the nail-biting pattern, Dr. Berry suggests you cover your fingertips with rubber caps or tape (not ideal if you’re stuck at a laptop all day) or getting a “fiddle basket” full of items that will keep your hands busy, like Theraputty, a stress ball or a tactile Pin Art toy.<br />If you’re still gnawing away, consider a cosmetic strategy. Removing temptation by maintaining short nails is an obvious option, but there are more attractive answers. Julie Kandalec, a New York celebrity manicurist, said her top tip is investing in a good pair of cuticle clippers that can snip hangnails—or dead skin. “If there’s nothing to feel, there’s nothing to pick,” she said, also stressing the importance of moisturizing your cuticles. Keep a sanitized pair of clippers, along with a nail file, by your side at all times so you can replace biting with (gentle) pruning.</td>

      <td>Former ECB President Mario Draghi has been asked to form a new government in Italy</td>
      <td>Italian government bonds rallied as investors cheered the news that former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi had been asked to form a new government.<br />The gap between yields on 10-year Italian bonds and their German equivalents fell to the tightest level in nearly five years, at 1.027 percentage points, according to  Tradeweb .  Yields fall when bond prices rise. Italy’s stock market also rallied, with the FTSE MIB benchmark up 2.6%.<br />Italy’s coalition government collapsed in January over arguments about how to spend European Union funding meant to spur the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Draghi, who was credited as ECB chief with saving the eurozone from its political and financial crisis in 2012, is seen by investors as a safe, technocratic leader capable of helping Italy out of its worst recession since World War II.<br />The market reaction suggests investors think Mr. Draghi can govern for a while and enact reforms, said Sebastien Galy, a macro strategist at  Nordea Asset Management .  But there are no guarantees.<br />“Should he fail to form a government, a snap election would be called, and the odds are still moderate that this will happen given the fractious nature of Italian politics,” Mr. Galy said.</td>

      <td>Robinhood Markets Inc. will advertise during the Super Bowl, as the online brokerage seeks to repair its image in the wake of the  GameStop Corp.  stock-trading saga.<br />Robinhood faced a backlash from customers and some lawmakers after it restricted trading on certain highflying stocks last week. Critics said the move ran counter to the brand’s mission of democratizing investing. Robinhood said the restrictions were put in place so it could meet the obligations of a clearinghouse that finalizes trades.<br />On Sunday, the company is expected to air a 30-second commercial during Super Bowl LV with the message that anyone can invest. The ad features a montage of ordinary people going about their lives—a young man going for a jog, a dad taking care of his infant, a woman dying her hair.<br />“We make short-term investments, long-term investments, we diversify our interests, realize our gains and losses, and try to keep the big picture in mind,” the narrator in the ad says. “You don’t need to become an investor, you were born one.”<br />Robinhood purchased the Super Bowl ad time, which has been selling for roughly $5.5 million for 30 seconds, in December. Amid the recent controversy, executives at the Silicon Valley startup discussed pulling out of the big game or creating a new ad, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company decided to move ahead with the commercial after seeing a surge in interest in the service—even with the negative publicity—the person said.</td>

Mr. Reig said the expansion of Revel’s business into electric-vehicle charging fits the company’s mission of expanding green technology.<br />Limited charging availability is seen as an impediment to electric-vehicle growth, especially in densely populated New York where many people don’t live in a home with access to electricity close to where they park their vehicle.</td>

The litigation is a particularly contentious example of the legal pushback startups face from legacy companies—increasingly the norm over the past decade for disruptive new businesses from Uber to  Airbnb ,  experts said.<br />Careismatic Brands, a leader in medical apparel with brands of scrubs like Cherokee and Dickies, has pursued litigation against Figs since 2019, saying the smaller company has misled health-care workers with boasts about how its products help keep them safe.<br />Figs’s advertising and social-media presence look more like those of a fashion brand than a medical-apparel maker, including sometimes irreverent videos and images of people wearing Figs while getting out of helicopters, skiing and skateboarding. Its online-sales model, aimed at selling directly to medical professionals, contrasts with Careismatic’s heavy reliance on bricks-and-mortar retailers.<br />Careismatic, previously known as Strategic Partners Inc., has asked a federal judge in Riverside, Calif., to issue an injunction requiring Figs to publicly renounce some marketing claims, including that its scrubs kill bacteria and infection on contact, repel liquids and reduce hospital-acquired infections by 66%.</td>

      <td>ROME—Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, was formally tasked by Italy’s president on Wednesday with forming a government of national unity to steer the country out of its political, economic and health crises.<br />Italy is turning to Mr. Draghi, one of Europe’s most respected public officials, at a time when it needs to shore up its credibility within the European Union, which last year promised to help finance Italy’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic but this month has looked askance at Rome, where the  government collapsed amid squabbles over how to spend the EU money, as well as personal animosities between politicians.<br />Financial markets welcomed the nomination of Mr. Draghi. Milan’s main stock-market index gained 2% Wednesday morning. The risk premium on Italian government bonds compared with supersafe German bonds declined to the lowest level for nearly five years.<br />Mr. Draghi, as ECB president, is widely credited with defusing the eurozone’s sovereign-debt crisis in 2012 by promising to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. His supporters hope Mr. Draghi can intervene with similar effectiveness in Italy’s economic policies. The country’s chronically weak growth for more than two decades is seen by many economists as the greatest threat to the euro’s long-term viability.<br />First, however, Mr. Draghi has to persuade a majority of lawmakers in a fragmented Parliament to support him. So far, only centrist parties have come out publicly in support, despite President Sergio Mattarella’s appeal for unity across partisan divides. To become prime minister, Mr. Draghi will need the support of the populist 5 Star Movement or the nationalist League. Both parties have in the past rejected the idea of governments led by economists and technocrats such as Mr. Draghi.</td>

      <td>Sony, like most gaming companies, has done exceptionally well this year. But it is also positioning itself cannily for the post-pandemic world.</td>
      <td>Gamers already snap up  Sony ’s  offerings, as the company’s blockbuster December quarter just demonstrated again. The movies and music business will soon be feeling its deepening influence too.<br />The Japanese electronics and entertainment giant said its operating profit for the quarter ended December rose 20% from a year earlier, driven by stay-at-home demand for its games. Revenue at its gaming division jumped 40% year-over-year—its best quarter ever. Sony also expects operating profit at the division this fiscal year ending in March will reach a record high.<br />Production bottlenecks have restricted shipments of new PlayStation 5 consoles, but the company still managed to sell 4.5 million units during the quarter. The new console, however, likely isn’t profitable after the initial marketing and development costs. The profit boost likely came from selling more games, especially digitally, in the quarter. Revenue from digital games and add-ons grew 65% from a year earlier. Its subscription service for gamers PlayStation Plus added 1.5 million subscribers during the quarter.<br />Sony raised its operating income outlook for this fiscal year by 34% to ¥940 billion, equivalent to $9 billion, which implies an 11% year-over-year increase. The company originally expected a decline in operating profit, mainly due to worries about its image sensor business. The segment did suffer a decline, but demand from Apple’s new iPhones helped soften the blow.<br />What is more encouraging is that Sony’s entertainment businesses outside of gaming are also going well. Its movie segment was hurt by theater closures, but that was more than offset by higher income from licensing content. Music streaming revenues continued to be strong. Aniplex, its anime production company under the music segment, has helped distribute the animated movie “Demon Slayer,” which has notched an all-time box office record in Japan. The popularity of the franchise could also provide opportunities for Sony’s game and music businesses.</td>

Yet, Refinitiv’s share of the market against its rival has been declining for years. That underscores the LSE’s challenge, particularly given that some users say Bloomberg’s ubiquitous data terminal that is found on institutional trading desks around the world is more expensive than the equivalent from Refinitiv.<br />The company’s slice of the global market data pie as measured by revenue fell from a market-leading 32% in 2010 to 21% in 2019, according to data from Burton-Taylor, the research and advisory arm of London-based brokerage TP ICAP.

Now, the pressure is on to win them back.<br />Match showed impressive resilience early on in the pandemic, making use of its virtual lines of communication for singles to continue to mingle remotely. Tuesday’s fourth-quarter results were no exception, slightly topping Wall Street’s estimates for sales and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.<br />Match’s shares—often volatile heading into quarterly earnings to begin with—took a dive in mid-January following competitor Bumble’s initial public offering filing, but had since recovered most of those losses. Then its shares tumbled again 5% after hours following Tuesday’s report, which included conservative first-quarter guidance, particularly on the bottom line in what the company said is typically a lower-margin period.<br />Investors shouldn’t be overly discouraged: Match entered the fourth quarter having outperformed the midpoint of its initial guidance by between 3% and 14% over the past three years, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. Impressively, its fourth-quarter numbers show it also met its initial revenue guidance for 2020, given way back in early November of 2019, before the first case of Covid-19 had even been identified.<br />For the past few years, the Match story has revolved around hookup app Tinder’s rapid growth. It now makes up well over half of the company’s overall revenue. Seeing this, many investors stepped to the sidelines amid the pandemic, as immediate gratification in online dating became as elusive as Lysol wipes and paper towels.

      <td>Apollo Global Management Inc.  reported higher fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday as the private-equity giant’s business weathered a storm kicked up by Chief Executive Leon Black’s ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.<br />The New York firm posted net income of $434.1 million, or $1.80 a share, up from earnings of $166 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. Driving that was a 14% increase in fee-related earnings. Apollo’s private-equity portfolio also appreciated 13% during the quarter compared with an 11.7% increase for the S&P 500.<br />But the firm’s financial performance may once again be overshadowed by Mr. Black’s relationship with Epstein, who was indicted in 2019 on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls and later died by suicide in jail.<br />A recently concluded review by Dechert LLP backed up Mr. Black’s assertion that fees he paid Epstein, which the law firm said totaled $158 million, were for legitimate tax- and estate-planning advice. It found no evidence he was involved in Epstein’s criminal activities.<br />The question for Apollo’s shareholders is whether Mr. Black’s decision to cede the CEO role to co-founder Marc Rowan, announced with the findings of the review last week, will be enough to put to rest concerns of public pension funds and other institutions that commit money to the firm’s funds. Some had said they would hold off on new investments with the firm until they learned the findings of the review.</td>

It was the kind of hardship that hadn’t been seen since the lockdown of Wuhan for the first Covid-19 outbreak a year earlier. As many pleaded that they were starving, saying “Don’t forget us,” city officials apologized and said they were short-handed.<br />The city of around 2 million, near the North Korean border, is one of many in the northeast that have fallen on hard times as China has restructured its overbuilt steel industry. Growth is markedly slower and many younger people have left in search of work.<br />Nearly one in four residents in Tonghua is 60 years old or older, compared with a national average of about 18%, official data show. The city now has less money coming in while also having more retirees to support—fault lines that became more obvious in its draconian pandemic response.<br />Last year, Tonghua only reported six cases of Covid-19. But in January, after at least 49 residents who had visited a center selling health-care products for the elderly tested positive, a downtown section of the city became the most locked-down place in China. City officials taped apartment doors shut in entire housing complexes practically overnight.</td>

With that came scrutiny and second-guessing from an industry that thrives on schadenfreude.<br />Less than a year into the job, Ms. Tarses’ eventual departure was already the subject of intense speculation, so much so that she once began a presentation to advertisers at Radio City Music Hall by saying, “What, you were expecting someone else?”</td>

President Biden has said an equitable distribution of small-business aid is a priority as his administration seeks to address racial and economic inequality.<br />Lawmakers from both parties have praised the program for providing a vital lifeline to small businesses during the pandemic. Still, it has faced scrutiny over potential fraud and concerns the loans weren’t sufficiently reaching mom-and-pop and minority-owned firms.<br />Those concerns followed the program’s rocky rollout last spring, as businesses without existing relationships with lenders—which issue the loans—struggled to access the program early on.</td>

      <td>But streaming giant offers conservative outlook for the current year as new sign-ups could ebb</td>
      <td>Spotify Technology SA  posted stronger-than-expected subscription growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 as more listeners tuned into music and podcasts from home amid the coronavirus pandemic. Still, the streaming giant offered a conservative outlook for the current year as new sign-ups could ebb.<br />At the end of the fourth quarter, Spotify had 345 million monthly active users, hitting the high end of its guidance, an increase of 27% from the same period a year ago. Paying subscribers, its most lucrative type of customer, grew to 155 million, up 24% from the same period a year ago, and topping expectations.<br />Average revenue per user for the subscription business fell 8% to €4.26, the equivalent of $5.13, from a year ago, as the company continued to attract new subscribers via discounted plans and charge lower prices in new markets such as India and Russia. In October, Spotify raised the price of its family plan in seven markets, a move the company said didn’t affect churn or customer intake. In February, it expanded price increases to another 25 markets, including in Europe, Latin America and Canada.<br />Revenue from subscriptions rose 15% from the year before, to €1.89 billion. Advertising revenue grew for a second consecutive quarter after sliding in the first half of the year amid pandemic headwinds, jumping 29% to €281 million. Advertising, historically less than 10% of Spotify’s top line, accounted for 13% of revenue. It has become a growth area as the company expands its podcast business.<br />The company said it now has 2.2 million podcasts available on its service, and consumption hours nearly doubled from the prior-year quarter. During the period, 25% of its monthly active users listened to a podcast, up from 22% in the previous quarter. In December, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” which arrived on Spotify in September, became exclusive to the service. It is the No. 1 show in 17 markets, and has helped bring in new users as well as attract first-time podcast listeners, the company said.</td>

      <td>High-powered officials have longstanding ties to one another, but different objectives in climate, human-rights and trade policies</td>
      <td>President Biden has stocked his China team with high-powered officials who have longstanding ties to one another but differing objectives. How they work together could determine whether the new administration has a unified China policy, or one riven with divisions that Beijing can exploit.<br />Former Secretary of State John Kerry, now the White House’s climate envoy, is pursuing an international climate deal that requires the cooperation of China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, to be effective. The White House’s China coordinator, Kurt Campbell, meanwhile wants to push back hard on China.<br />Both men sit on the National Security Council, led by Jake Sullivan, who worked with them during the Obama administration. Former Obama national-security adviser Susan Rice, now a Biden domestic policy adviser, may also weigh in on some China issues, say some of her former colleagues.<br />Mr. Sullivan now needs to weave together their views along with those of the heads of the Treasury, State Department, Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative’s office, which often have diverging perspectives.<br />During her confirmation hearing last week, Commerce Secretary-designate Gina Raimondo wouldn’t commit to continuing the Trump administration’s blacklisting of Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei Technologies Co., although Messrs. Campbell and Sullivan had previously identified the firm as a security risk.</td>

He was initially skeptical of the GameStop exuberance, but the rowdy community soon won him over. “It was pretty enticing,” he said.</td>

      <td>White House says a raise would help workers; opponents warn of job cuts</td>
      <td>President Biden says his proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour will lift many low-wage workers out of poverty, but some businesses and economists warn it could cost jobs as the U.S. recovers from pandemic layoffs.<br />Mr. Biden endorses a plan to more than double the wage in steps over four years, noting that at $15 an hour, a job could support a family of four and it wouldn’t live in poverty. The president’s advisers also say raising the wage from $7.25 an hour, where it has stood since 2009, would show gratitude to essential workers at grocery stores and warehouses who stayed on the job during the coronavirus pandemic and would boost the economy by allowing low-wage workers to spend more.<br />Some large national employers have done well during the pandemic, Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of Mr. Biden’s National Economic Council, said in an interview. “The compensation for their employees hasn’t necessarily reflected that. Raising the minimum wage is one way of giving workers a more fair slice of the revenues that they help generate.”<br />Several states, including California, Florida and Massachusetts are already on a path to reach a $15 minimum wage in coming years, but Mr. Ramamurti said the floor should apply to areas with a lower cost of living. A federal minimum-wage increase requires congressional approval.<br />“No matter where you work in America, if you work full time or 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty,” he said. “A $15 minimum wage accomplishes that.”</td>
