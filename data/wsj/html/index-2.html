      <td>Brazil is first country to complete Phase 3 trials of Chinese company’s vaccine; official results due out Wednesday</td>
      <td>SÃO PAULO—Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s Covid-19 vaccine, which scientists hope can help combat the pandemic in the developing world, has passed the 50% threshold for efficacy in late-stage trials in Brazil, meaning regulators can give it the green light for use, people involved in its development said.<br />Brazil is the first country to complete Phase 3 trials of the Chinese company’s CoronaVac vaccine, which is also being tested in Indonesia and Turkey. With Covid-19 largely under control in China, the country’s vaccine developers have had to conduct their clinical trials abroad.<br />People involved in the Brazilian trials, which completed Phase 3 last week, told The Wall Street Journal that the results showed CoronaVac with an effective rate above 50%, the threshold for a vaccine to be considered viable by international scientists. The people declined to give any further information. But scientists tracking the vaccine’s development say they expect it to show efficacy comparable to other Covid-19 vaccines that have proven 95% effective in trials.<br />“Everyone is hoping for an efficacy rate above 90%,” said Domingos Alves, a professor at Ribeirão Preto Medical School in São Paulo who specializes in analyzing health data. “The results from the first phases of trials were very good.”<br />Brazil’s Butantan Institute, the research center backed by the São Paulo state government that has been testing CoronaVac, is poised to announce the vaccine’s efficacy rate on Wednesday. Butantan said Monday that it considers any information given at this time on the vaccine’s efficacy as “mere speculation.”</td>

      <td>Trump and the GOP revive the loophole for business meals. It’s bad policy and bad politics.</td>
      <td>Congress’s latest Covid relief and omnibus spending bills are a mash-up of special favors for teachers unions, the booze industry, wind power, race horses, and so much more. There’s even a bailout for Broadway; take a bow, Chuck Schumer. But for a sign of the political times, and how far Congress has strayed from basic economic logic, you can’t beat the return of the full business meal deduction.<br />President Trump has been pushing this for months, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made it a priority in negotiations. Perhaps Mr. Trump recalls fondly the days when real-estate and other executives could write off lunch or dinner at the 21 Club. Go ahead and order that Clos de Tart 2005. You can write it off. In the 1970s this became known as the “three-martini lunch” deduction when Jimmy Carter campaigned against it. The full deduction finally went away during the Reagan tax reform in the 1980s.<br />Now the deduction will return “for food or beverages provided by a restaurant” for the next two years through the end of 2022. The claim is that this will help struggling restaurants revive after the pandemic ends by giving businesses an extra incentive to leave the office for lunch. The estimated cost is $6 billion in forgone tax revenue, which is spare change for Congress this year.<br />This is bad tax policy now or any time. Restaurants have suffered during the pandemic, especially in states like New York with overly strict lockdowns. But they won’t be revived by a tax deduction for lunch. They’ll revive as the pandemic fades and the public feels safe enough to return. No business people we know make a lunch decision for tax reasons, and corporations don’t need another tax code carve-out.<br />This isn’t Covid relief. It’s a political favor for a specific industry. But why restaurants, and not hardware stores or flower shops? They’ve also suffered during the pandemic. Will a night out to see the Miami Heat qualify for the deduction if you take your clients to a game and eat at the stadium sushi bar? Why not other forms of entertainment? The unfairness is obvious, which is what happens when politicians use the tax code as a vote-buying exercise.</td>

      <td>SpaceX keeps making remarkable rocket launches look routine.</td>
      <td>We don’t have to remind readers of the ways that 2020 has been dispiriting, but there’s been some good news. The Covid vaccine rollout is a tribute to American ingenuity, and then there’s the remarkable success of the SpaceX rocket launches.<br />The latter have become so routine that they barely make the news. On Saturday the company lit the fuse on one of its 229-foot Falcon 9 rockets, which put into orbit a U.S. spy satellite. It was SpaceX’s 26th launch of 2020.<br />The part that looks surreal is when the Falcon 9’s first stage plummets back to Earth, fires its engines to arrest its fall, and then sticks an upright landing. Saturday’s rocket was launched from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. Eight minutes later, the first stage touched down on a landing pad at nearby Cape Canaveral. If you’ve never seen the feat, check out the footage online.<br />The repeat landings are a technical and economic achievement since they lower the cost of access to orbit. The Falcon 9 booster on Saturday was completing its fifth mission. This was SpaceX’s 70th successful recovery, and in November a booster was used for a seventh time. SpaceX says one might eventually fly 10 missions without a major refurbishing. The company is aiming at a 24-hour turnaround from landing to relaunch. For almost a decade after the final Space Shuttle flight in 2011, Americans had to hitch a ride to the International Space Station on Russian craft. Now they can take the Falcon 9.<br />Space exploration is risky, and two weeks ago a prototype of SpaceX’s Starship, a 160-foot silvery rocket that founder Elon Musk wants to send to Mars, was meant to gently land during a test. Instead it came down too fast and exploded in a fireball. But Mr. Musk wasn’t fazed, at least on  Twitter : “We got all the data we needed! Congrats SpaceX team hell yeah!!”</td>

      <td>The U.S. needs more ships to counter China and project power.</td>
      <td>The Trump Administration is spending some of its last days in office provoking a debate about building a larger and more lethal U.S.Navy to check China in the Pacific. This political document arrives late, but give the Trump Team credit for issuing this challenge to President-elect Joe Biden.<br />National Security AdviserRobert O’Brien and budget director Russ Vought recently laid out on these pages a plan to reach a 355-ship Navy in about a decade, up from roughly 295 today. The Pentagon has been debating and studying how to expand the fleet, and the Trump plan suggests underwriting more than 80 ships over five years at a cost of $147 billion.<br />Americans expect a dominant Navy that can deter adversaries while enforcing order on commercial sea lanes. The Navy’s top officer noted to Congress on Dec. 2 that for the past two decades the service sustained the same operational tempo as the Cold War but with a fleet almost half the size. The Navy has recently been overworking aircraft carriers with back-to-back “double pump” deployments.<br />Also notable is a consensus that the Navy needs a more diverse mix of assets. The Trump document features a Navy with more small ships like frigates, which can carry out a range of missions and be procured at lower cost than, say, destroyers. Another essential idea is ramping up production of attack submarines that would be crucial in any conflict with China.<br />The plan would also scale up unmanned ships and vehicles. These technologies are exciting but nascent and the risk is that they become the next Pentagon sinkhole. Speaking of sinkholes, another important debate concerns the future of Ford-class aircraft carriers. The first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford, price tag $13 billion, has long been mired in technology problems and delays. Carriers are also attractive targets for Chinese missiles. One percolating idea is smaller “light” carriers to complement the existing fleet of 11.</td>

      <td>Yet another scandal at the nation’s largest housing authority.</td>
      <td>Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City Housing Authority (Nycha) are the worst landlords in the Big Apple, according to a watch list released last week by the city’s public advocate. A new report by the New York City Department of Investigation offers some supporting evidence.<br />Nycha is supposed to clean up lead paint in apartments where young children live, and a supervisor certified by the Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to ensure the job gets done right. Instead, Nycha’s managers resorted to fraud and forgery, the Department of Investigation found. The probe revealed that “at least since 2013, none of NYCHA’s lead abatement jobs were ever supervised by an EPA-certified lead supervisor,” the department said in a news release. Instead, “the manager of the Lead Unit pressured employees to falsely sign paperwork stating that these jobs were supervised.”<br />Because of this falsification, it’s unclear whether lead-abatement work was done properly—or done at all—in thousands of homes. Investigators found 163 work orders with faked signatures, though they believe “the true number” is “much higher.” Based on fraudulent paperwork, the EPA approved exemptions allowing 323 Nycha homes to skip the annual visual lead inspection.<br />This trickery imperiled the health of some of New York City’s poorest children. Department of Investigation Commissioner Margaret Garnett said she’s discovered 19 young children with elevated blood-levels who lived in apartments where the paperwork was falsified. “There is no safe level of lead exposure, especially for children,” her report notes. It has been linked to lowered IQ and learning and behavioral problems, and these “cognitive effects of lead toxicity are irreversible.”<br />Nycha cooperated with investigators and has since “made significant systemic changes to its lead abatement program,” said spokeswoman Barbara Brancaccio. Yet such carelessness and cover-ups are business as usual at the nation’s largest housing authority, which barely avoided a federal takeover. The apartments are also plagued by vermin, mold and leaks, among other problems.</td>

      <td>My agency makes a significant advance in the government’s approach to science.</td>
      <td>The world’s climate is changing, as it always has. The challenge is to understand how and why, which is why the U.S. Geological Survey has adopted the most comprehensive climate analysis requirements ever implemented by the federal government.<br />Forecasting future responses and impacts for a system as complex as the Earth is difficult and uncertain. Consider the simple example of forecasting a hurricane where multiple models assess potential tracks within a foreseeable future of only five to seven days. The uncertainty of where the hurricane makes landfall and at what strength increases the farther out the forecast is from this timeframe because there are more variables to consider.<br />Similarly, predicting short-term, global climate changes, which are significantly more complex than forecasting hurricanes because there are less variables to assess with a hurricane than our entire planet, is far more certain than making long-term projections. The science is limited in forecasting a narrow range of plausible climate outcomes past the next two to three decades.<br />Improving our ability to forecast natural hazards and other climate conditions requires that we continue to refine our understanding of the systems, identify and scope the critical variabilities, and regularly update our forecasting to deliver the best possible information for the health, safety and well-being of our communities.<br />The U.S. Geological Survey is at the forefront of climate science for the federal government. USGS’s chief scientist, Geoffrey Plumlee, and other career scientists recently published a report, “Using Information From Global Climate Models to Inform Policymaking—the Role of the U.S. Geological Survey,” which outlines a broad, consistent and empirical approach for analyzing climate change conditions.</td>

      <td>As the faith spreads, the Communist Party fears a threat to its political control.</td>
      <td>With the European Parliament threatening to block an investment deal with China over persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang, the shock waves released by Beijing’s Hong Kong crackdown still reverberating, and the debate over the next U.S. administration’s China policy heating up, this would seem like a bad time for Beijing to kick off another major international dustup over human rights.<br />But that logic holds little appeal for Chinese policy makers today; crushing domestic dissent takes priority over burnishing the country’s image. This is bad news for China’s Christians, who face growing hostility from a ruling party that until a few years ago was willing to turn a blind eye to the proliferation of unofficial “house churches” across the country.<br />That era of toleration coincided with one of the greatest expansions of Christianity in the past 2,000 years. From an estimated three million believers at the end of the Cultural Revolution, the number of Protestants in China is now believed to exceed 100 million, with another 10 million to 12 million Catholics. (The government offers an implausible figure of 38 million Protestants.) The Council on Foreign Relations cites a 2018 estimate from Purdue’s Center on Religion and Chinese Society of between 93 million and 115 million Protestants in China. Much of the growth has come since 2010, and some projections suggest that by 2030 China could surpass America to have the largest population of Christians in the world.<br />This is one of the few competitions with the U.S. that Beijing does not want to win. Churches are increasingly targets of the Chinese Communist Party’s repression of free speech. Some have been demolished; others have been “secularized” as local officials tear down religious symbols such as crosses. Authorities are now demanding the installation of cameras to monitor worshipers’ behavior and pastors’ sermons. There are reports of Catholic churches being forced to replace pictures of the Virgin Mary with portraits of Xi Jinping.<br />In October, National Review’s Cameron Hilditch pointed to a Xinhua News Agency report that the Communist Party has decided to produce a state-approved Bible. Mr. Hilditch reports that one change is to the New Testament story in which Jesus spares a woman taken in adultery from stoning by telling her accusers not to cast the first stone unless they are sinless. In the new, improved version, when the accusers have left, Jesus stones the woman himself, saying, “I too am a sinner. But if the law could only be executed by men without blemish, the law would be dead.”</td>

      <td>Tip O’Neill famously advised that “all politics is local.” Not on Jan. 5 and not in Georgia.<br />On that day Georgians will choose their two U.S. senators. But the outcome has more to do with Washington than Georgia. If Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock both win, their party will hold not only the White House but both houses of Congress. This would give Joe Biden an opportunity to run the table on everything from judicial nominees and tax hikes to trillions in spending.<br />But if one or both Republican incumbents prevail—Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler—Mitch McConnell will continue to lead a Republican majority that would then be in a position to block much of Mr. Biden’s agenda. In this way the outcome of the double runoff will help determine the power and reach of the Biden administration.<br />The latest RealClearPolitics average shows Mr. Perdue leading Mr. Ossoff 49.6% to 48.0%, and Ms. Loeffler up over Mr. Warnock 49.2% to 48.4%. But the results remain within the margin of error, and there are too many variables to predict the outcome with any confidence.<br />The biggest variable is who will turn out, and in what numbers. According to Georgia Votes, 1,471,144 people have voted so far—roughly 1 in 5 registered voters. Based on which party ballot those who voted in the June primary requested, it’s now running 59% to 39% in favor of Democrats.</td>

Rolling the bill into the $1.4 trillion funding package, expected to win House and Senate passage, eliminates opportunities for debate or amendments.<br />Hammered out by lawmakers to respond to public anger over the 737 MAX tragedies, the final language gives the FAA substantially more authority to oversee technical details and reject company engineering decisions.<br />The legislation also empowers FAA leaders to individually vet industry officials designated to act on behalf of the agency in safety matters. Currently, companies choose such so-called designees with limited FAA input. And it authorizes fines and other penalties if company supervisors exert undue pressure on engineers to meet cost or schedule targets.<br />Other provisions establish new protections for whistleblowers and provide increased funding to enhance the agency’s expertise, particularly in assessing how pilots react to malfunctions of automated cockpit systems.</td>

      <td>Ebony Media Operations LLC plans to sell its business to an investment group led by former NBA player Ulysses “Junior” Bridgeman for about $14 million, the only serious offer received by the bankrupt publisher of Black magazines.<br />Last July the owner of its namesake magazine was forced into bankruptcy by Parkview Capital Credit and other creditors that said they wanted to take over the publication, which has chronicled Black culture for 75 years but has fallen on hard times.<br />The involuntary bankruptcy came weeks after Ebony’s main shareholder was fired as chief executive and removed from the board. The company said it would investigate financial transactions he had made, allegedly without board or lender approval.<br />Ebony stopped publishing in print in 2019. The company’s assets consist mostly of intellectual property, including Ebony and Jet trademarks, the related domain names and websites, and certain legacy published materials.<br />In October, Bridgeman Sports & Media LLC was named the lead bidder subject to better and higher offers in a process supervised by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston.</td>

      <td>President-elect still forecasting crisis after his inauguration.</td>
      <td>In the days leading up to the November elections Joe Biden told some whoppers on the subject of health care. Perhaps that’s to be expected in the heat of a political campaign. But his post-election comments are harder to figure. Mr. Biden’s Monday Covid-19 vaccination in Delaware proves he now understands that his consistent skepticism about the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed was misguided. Yet Mr. Biden continues to promote the same policy agenda based on his original false premise.<br />Candidate Biden claimed that the president had no plan for addressing the virus and warned that Americans couldn’t trust Mr. Trump to oversee a quick and safe vaccine approval. With today’s vaccination Mr. Biden has effectively rebutted his own campaign warnings.<br />The outstanding work of the pharmaceutical industry, encouraged and enabled by President Trump, has already resulted in two approved vaccines, and yes, there is a distribution plan. The Journal’s Peter Loftus and Charles Passy report on the newly authorized Covid-19 vaccine from  Moderna Inc. :<br />“The second shot in a one-two punch against the coronavirus is here,”  reports Michael Gartland today for the New York Daily News. He adds:<br />It’s exciting for people all over the world. In the U.S., it suggests the  problem will be largely solved by Inauguration Day.

      <td>Congress is poised to authorize another round of direct payments to households. There are a few key changes from the spring payments.</td>
      <td>Congress is likely to vote soon to authorize a second round of stimulus payments to households. There are many similarities to the ones that were paid in the spring but also some important differences. Here is what we know about them, though things could change as Congress releases details of the legislation and the government implements the program.<br />When will the second stimulus payments arrive?<br />Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday the first batch of payments could go out at the beginning of next week. That is faster than in the spring, where it took about two weeks after the legislation was signed. The first batches may also be larger than in the spring. That is because the government now has more information about groups that got later payments in the first round, including those who typically don’t file tax returns and those who receive federal benefits. Those who receive paper checks instead of direct deposits will have to wait longer. The bill is written so the IRS makes the payments by Jan. 15, meaning that anyone eligible after that date would likely have to get the money as part of their 2020 tax return.<br />How much are the payments?<br />This time, households will get $600 per adult and $600 per child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round. That means a single parent with two children will get $1,800 now after receiving $2,200 in the spring.</td>

A challenge for 2021 and beyond: tracking where the dollars go and what changes the pledges will bring.<br />Big businesses made commitments of a cumulative $35 billion in the past six months, according to a review of announcements by The Wall Street Journal, in response to a national debate about systemic racism following the killing of George Floyd while being arrested by Minneapolis police on May 25. Companies say the money will go toward boosting the net worth of Black families, creating professional opportunities for minorities and diversifying their own ranks, among other outcomes.<br />The bulk of the $35 billion stems from  JPMorgan Chase  & Co.’s October pledge to invest $30 billion over the next five years into such efforts as financing affordable housing and opening branches in neighborhoods where financial services are scarce.<br />Major banks are behind some of the other biggest pledges, including $1 billion from  Bank of America Corp.  and $1.15 billion by  Citigroup Inc.  to provide capital to Black business owners and home buyers, among other measures.<br />Elsewhere,  Walmart Inc.  has pledged to found a center for racial equity, through which it will donate $100 million to nonprofit groups over five years.

      <td>The media’s politicization of Covid has proved deadly and puts Americans’ freedoms at risk.</td>
      <td>America has been paralyzed by death and fear for nearly a year, and the politicization of the pandemic has made things worse by adding misinformation and vitriol to the mix. With vaccines finally being administered, we should be entering a joyous phase. Instead we endure still more inflammatory rhetoric and media distortion.<br />Americans need to understand three realities. First, all 50 states independently directed and implemented their own pandemic policies. In every case, governors and local officials were responsible for on-the-ground choices—every business limit, school closing, shelter-in-place order and mask requirement. No policy on any of these issues was set by the federal government, except those involving federal property and employees.<br />Second, nearly all states used the same draconian policies that people now insist on hardening, even though the number of positive cases increased while people’s movements were constrained, business activities were strictly limited, and schools were closed. Governors in all but a few states—Florida and South Dakota are notable exceptions—imposed curfews, quarantines, directives on group gatherings, and mask mandates.<br />Mobility tracking verifies that people restricted their movement. Gallup and YouGov data show that 80% to 90% of Americans have been wearing masks since early August. Lockdown policies had baleful effects on local economies, families and children, and the virus spread anyway. If one advocates more lockdowns because of bad outcomes so far, why don’t the results of those lockdowns matter?<br />Third, the federal government’s role in the pandemic has been grossly mischaracterized by the media and their Democratic allies. That distortion has obscured several significant successes, while undermining the confidence of ordinary Americans. Federal financial support and directives enabled the development of a massive, state-of-the-art testing capacity and produced billions of dollars of personal protective equipment. Federal agencies met all requests for supplemental medical personnel and hospital-bed capacity. Officials in the Health and Human Services Department have told me there are no unmet requests for extra resources.</td>

If you do go to church, remember—no singing, by order of the elders. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is not the first flamboyantly coiffed authoritarian governor-protector in history to ban the singing of Christmas carols. But at least Oliver Cromwell never went near a French laundry, as far as we know.<br />“The feast of Christ’s nativity is spent in reveling, dicing, carding, masking, and in all licentious liberty . . . by mad mirth, by long eating, by hard drinking, by lewd gaming, by rude reveling!” Cotton Mather declaimed from his pulpit in 1712, denouncing the traditional Christmas celebrations of the time.<br />I can’t speak to the lewd gaming anyone may have been planning this year, but other than the “masking”—which, in an odd inversion of the rules of officially approved behavior is now mandatory rather than proscribed—Mather’s early 18th-century injunctions are pretty much in place in the 21st. That’s progressivism for you.<br />The prospect of a good old Cotton Mather Yuletide is a fitting end to a year in which the puritanical tendency has again entrenched itself as the dominant force in American politics.<br />The modern left’s mission to extirpate sin from society is the product of a secular religion of the most austere sort.</td>

      <td>New studies point to the trillions of organisms in the human microbiome as playing an unexpectedly huge role in our well-being</td>
      <td><br />Scientists are exploring evidence that major depression may in part be a gut feeling, orchestrated by the microbiome—trillions of microorganisms living in and around our bodies, which influence our health and well-being.<br />In a series of studies, researchers are discovering that the microbial menagerie living in our digestive tract may help regulate brain function, including mental health. Recent findings by scientists in the U.S., Europe and China are linking our feelings of stress, anxiety and severe depression to disturbances among hundreds of microbe species living in our gut that some researchers have started calling the psychobiome.<br />Conversely, other bacteria in the gut appear to produce some of the same substances used by doctors to treat depression and may naturally play a role in maintaining our emotional balance.<br />“The feeling of malaise, if you will, is often associated with gastrointestinal disorders,” said microbiologist Jack Gilbert at the University of California, San Diego and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who helped pioneer the study of the human gut microbiome. It is “chemically altering nerve signals going into the brain, which alter brain chemistry and therefore behavior, mood and, we believe, depression and anxiety.”</td>

      <td>European Medicines Agency recommends authorization for the shot, clearing way for formal approval this week</td>
      <td>BRUSSELS—The Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and its German partner  BioNTech SE  was cleared for use by the European Union’s drug agency, a major step in efforts to tame the disease in a region that is fighting a deadly winter surge, as the bloc also tries to keep out a new mutation in the coronavirus found in Britain.<br />The European Medicines Agency said that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine—which was developed in Germany—is safe and effective against Covid-19, paving the way for EU authorities to formally authorize the use of the shot this week. Distribution could begin next week, following administrative procedures needed to coordinate a rollout across 27 member states.<br />The EU is also grappling with concerns over the spread of a new variant of the coronavirus in the U.K. that has prompted many countries to ban passenger flights from that country in an effort to prevent entry of the mutation, which the British government says is more infectious.<br />The decision to recommend authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine comes after the U.K. and the U.S. approved it in early December. Some EU leaders expressed anger at the bloc’s slower pace, in light of the thousands of Europeans dying of the disease each day. The agency moved up the timing of its decision by a week.<br />U.S. regulators on Friday also permitted use of Moderna, Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine, with the first immunizations expected Monday.</td>

      <td>Companies plan to encourage, incentivize vaccination; ‘Here is the carrot, and here is the stick’</td>
      <td>Some of America’s largest businesses say they will encourage—but not mandate—employees to get Covid-19 vaccines, using a mix of incentives and consequences to ensure as many workers as possible are inoculated.<br />Facebook Inc.,   Marriott International Inc.,  and  Discover Financial Services  are among big employers saying they will urge vaccinations and highlight the benefits of doing so but stop short of requiring them. Covid-19 vaccines are likely to be available to anyone in the U.S. who wants one by the end of the second quarter, federal officials said this week.<br />Some employers plan to provide 401(k) or other cash incentives to staff, as they do to encourage use of other wellness benefits, or bar unvaccinated employees from certain activities. Several executives have said they would offer their corporate facilities to public-health officials as vaccine administration sites in making shots convenient for workers.<br />The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last week released guidance noting that employers can generally require their workers to get vaccinated and may ask employees for proof that they have done so. Employers are bound to accommodate employees who object because of religious beliefs or because they have a medical condition that makes it unsafe for them to get a vaccine.<br />Human-resources leaders and chief executives say they aren’t mandating vaccinations because they want to respect the views of those who lack confidence in the new vaccines, avoid liability if there are adverse reactions and not infringe on religious or personal beliefs. The approach is similar to how large companies often handle seasonal flu shots, though this vaccine targets a novel virus that shut down many workplaces across the country, corporate medical advisers say.</td>

      <td>Royal Dutch  Shell  PLC said it would write down the value of its assets by up to $4.5 billion and warned of another set of poor earnings for the fourth quarter, showing how the oil-and-gas industry continues to struggle amid the fallout of the pandemic.<br />The energy giant said Monday its oil-and-gas production business would likely report a third consecutive loss in the last three months of the year, and that results from its trading operations—a bright spot earlier in the pandemic amid volatile oil prices—would be below average.<br />Shell’s update is the first indication of another tough quarter for the oil-and-gas sector, which continues to grapple with lower demand as Covid-19 lockdowns hit economies hard and halt travel around the world.<br />The downbeat trading update, issued ahead of fourth-quarter earnings due in February, comes despite a recovery in oil prices in recent weeks after vaccines to fight the virus were approved in some countries. Benchmark Brent oil has stabilized and reversed some losses, gaining almost 20% in the past three months to trade at around $50 a barrel, having briefly traded below $20 a barrel in April.<br />However, while Shell noted improved refining and chemical margins compared with the previous quarter, the rising oil price doesn’t appear to have been enough to turnaround the company’s fortunes.</td>

Half a year later, workers of color are taking stock of the results.<br />It’s a mixed bag.

      <td>Congress is close to agreement on another trillion-dollar Covid-19 relief bill, but please don’t call this economic stimulus. With some exceptions, the main relief here is for the politicians who want to take credit for doling out more cash to constituents.<br />The best provision in the bill is the limit on potential abuse by the Biden Treasury and Federal Reserve. Credit here to Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who held firm on limiting the Fed’s maneuvering room without a new act of Congress. Democrats are claiming victory, but that’s face-saving spin.<br />The bill will repurpose the $429 billion in Cares Act emergency funding that the Fed hasn’t had to use. It also includes language barring the Fed from restarting the facilities that are set to expire on Dec. 31 or creating clones. That’s important because the wailing over this language proves that Democrats want to use the Fed to bail out state and local governments. They said so in the House Heroes Act by demanding 10-year, 25-basis-point Fed loans.<br />Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his media echoes targeted Mr. Toomey as their villain du jour, as if financial markets are still in a crisis. They also claimed Mr. Toomey wanted to rewrite the law governing 13(3) Fed facilities, but that is false. His aim is to make sure that emergency facilities don’t become open-ended fiscal programs. Bigger companies now have ample access to private credit, and small businesses are getting more direct aid.<br />Readers may recall that last March Democrats were calling the money for Fed pandemic facilities a “slush fund” for Donald Trump. “Trump wants our response to be a half-trillion dollar slush fund to boost favored companies and corporate executives,” Elizabeth Warren tweeted. Joe Biden slammed the Fed programs as a “$500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions.” The Trump Treasury used the money responsibly.</td>

We hope the Members ignore his pleas.<br />Meanwhile, after days of silence over the hack on U.S. government agencies and private companies, Mr. Trump chimed in Saturday to add confusion. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that the evidence clearly points to the Russians for the hack.<br />But Mr. Trump tweeted that “Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream [media] is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of . . . discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).” Then he linked the hack to a possible “hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA.”</td>

      <td>Rhode Island allows more charter schools after union failures.</td>
      <td>A report last year found abject student performance, demoralized teachers and deteriorating buildings in Providence, Rhode Island’s traditional public schools. Well, this particular hell may have frozen over, as last week the state’s education council voted to expand and open more charter schools to rescue students in the district.<br />About 13% of Providence’s 30,000 students attend 28 charter schools, some in other districts. But demand far exceeds supply. Only 18% of the 5,000 or so charter school applicants were offered a seat this school year, according to the state education department. Eighty-four percent of Providence students are low-income and 92% are minorities.<br />The state education council last week gave preliminary approval for more than 5,700 new charter seats in Providence and other districts. Three of four new charters that applied got a green-light to open, pending final approval in the spring, and three existing charters (two of which serve Providence) are expanding. “Parents of color don’t have a lot of choice and resources,” said Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green, who pushed the expansion. “We should not be closing opportunities.”<br />The teachers union isn’t happy. In a letter to Gov. Gina Raimondo, three union leaders including American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten complained that the expansion would “financially destabilize the Providence school district, because it would drain money from neighborhood public schools.”<br />This is the usual rhetorical union trick. Charters are public schools, albeit without the barnacles and costs of union control. Funding for charter schools in Rhode Island follows the student, though local districts retain a portion for fixed costs when students leave for a charter. The state took over the Providence school district, including the budget, last year after the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy exposed the school horror show in a study.</td>

      <td>Strapped hospitals are struggling to set up infusion sites. But states and the feds can help.</td>
      <td>The Friday approval of a second Covid vaccine is welcome news, but much of the public won’t be able to get inoculated for many months. Meanwhile, the best way to reduce suffering and hardship is therapeutic technologies like antibody drugs. But right now, many of these drugs are languishing on shelves at hospitals and not reaching patients.<br />Moncef Slaoui, who runs Operation Warp Speed, said recently that more than 80% of the available supply is sitting unused, even as hospitals are inundated with critically ill patients. Antibody drugs infuse patients with synthetic versions of the kinds of immune cells developed in response to an infection. Early trials show antibody cocktails can stop Covid symptoms from progressing. They can be used with or without vaccines for patients at highest risk of severe disease.<br />The supply is limited. The two companies with authorized versions, Eli Lily and Regeneron, will ship a little more than one million doses by the end of the year. Evidence suggests that for every 10 high-risk patients treated, one hospitalization might be avoided. That may sound modest, but it adds up: a million doses administered could translate into 100,000 fewer hospitalizations. Such a reprieve would help hospitals keep up with the current surge.<br />The biggest difficulty is logistical. Patients need to be referred for antibodies soon after diagnosis. The infusion takes several hours to prepare, deliver and monitor. A specialized nurse must supervise, with protective equipment, in a space separate from other patients to minimize spread.<br />Most early doses have been going to hospitals. But many hospitals are strapped by Covid and having a hard time setting up dedicated space and redirecting trained nursing and support staff. The government should send more antibodies to community infusion centers and clinics that have taken steps to administer doses. These clinics can work with testing sites to speed referrals.</td>

      <td>Children under 10 can’t be expected to stare at a computer for hours.</td>
      <td>Online learning is especially difficult for young children, and schools are blaming parents. A woman came to see me because her 8-year-old daughter’s school recommended neuropsychological evaluation. Each day the girl was expected to sit in a chair, stare at a computer for hours, listen, memorize and repeat. Not surprisingly, she had trouble staying engaged, often got up and moved around, and was distracted when the teacher called on her. She had no learning or attention problems before Covid-19 and her reactions were perfectly normal. The problem was the school’s unrealistic expectations.<br />The pandemic and the shift to online learning seem to be intensifying the trend toward pathologizing ordinary childhood behavior. Diagnosing a child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder isn’t straightforward. It can be challenging to determine if the child’s behavior indicates a neurodevelopmental disorder or a natural response to a stressful and stifling environment. The prevalence of ADHD diagnoses among U.S. children and adolescents rose from 6.1% in 1997-98 to 10.2% in 2015-16 among U.S. children and adolescents. A 2015 study found a correlation between rates of ADHD diagnosis and laws penalizing school districts when students fail, suggesting that diagnostic rates can be influenced by policy.<br />Covid-19 shutdowns complicate the matter further. Teachers and administrators expect to be able to teach young children in the same way they did when they were face to face. But children under 10 have a hard time learning remotely, even if they clearly don’t have ADHD—and the younger the child, the more difficult the task. Young children are filled with exploratory energy, and need outlets for play and creativity.<br />That said, it is exciting to watch as education-technology entrepreneurs work to find solutions to this school failure. New online tutoring companies for young children use more creative and experiential methods of teaching, don’t expect children to stay online for long and have realistic expectations for what kids can learn in the online format. “Our children are feeling unheard and unseen, with a thoughtful, hands-on, playful and experiential approach remote learning can be successful for even the youngest of learners,” said Mary Cantwell, a co-founder of EnrichedNYC. “But the schools are not implementing such an approach. ”<br />As the second half of the school year begins, parents and teachers must accept that distraction and disengagement during online learning are normal, not pathological. Children are feeling frustrated and need compassion rather than judgment, criticism and impatience from the adults in their lives. For most, 2020-21 won’t be a year of great academic achievement. But it could be a year of strengthening relationships with family members, building resilience and emotional maturity, and learning to cope with the disappointment and adversity of missing friends and activities. The most important lessons for everyone this year will be learned outside the classroom.</td>

      <td>Many civilian lives could be saved by using tourniquets.</td>
      <td>Robyn Gardner lay bleeding by a river near Sacramento, Calif., her thigh ripped open by a boat’s propeller. A former Army medic happened to be nearby. He applied a tourniquet, which immediately stopped the bleeding and stabilized Gardner. But when the ambulance arrived, the crew removed the tourniquet, because tourniquets weren’t an approved trauma intervention in the jurisdiction. EMTs tried other techniques to control the bleeding, but Gardner died at 38 in 2003.<br />Tourniquets save lives, but an exaggerated fear of tissue damage led medical authorities to ban them from use on both military and civilian trauma patients. Some 3,400 American lives were lost in Vietnam from failure to use these simple devices.<br />That realization prompted a four-year review of battlefield trauma care, which led to the development of Tactical Combat Casualty Care, first described in 1996. TCCC recommends tourniquets for life-threatening extremity bleeding until the casualty reaches a surgeon. But most U.S. military units ignored the advice at first and didn’t carry tourniquets into Afghanistan and Iraq.<br />That changed as casualties mounted. In 2005 the U.S. Special Operations Command and the U.S. Central Command both mandated tourniquet use. Studies since have found hundreds of American lives have been saved on the battlefield with tourniquets and little danger of tissue damage.<br />Civilian trauma care has always benefited from military wartime experience, but the process can be slow. By 2010 tourniquets were routine in the military but rare outside it. Civilian tourniquet use increased significantly after 2013, when Hartford, Conn., trauma surgeon Lenworth Jacobs convened a group of experts to study ways of saving lives in civilian mass casualty incidents such as the Sandy Hook school shooting. The Hartford Consensus led the American College of Surgeons and the American College of Emergency Physicians to endorse tourniquet use by professional first responders.</td>

This repression has destroyed the lives of intellectuals.”<br />Lots of Cubans will tell you similar things privately, but few have dared utter them in public. Until now.<br />The San Isidro Movement was formed in 2018 to oppose a new law making it a crime to engage in performance art without permission from the Ministry of Culture.

The first “Wonder Woman” grossed $103.3 million in the U.S. and Canada during its opening weekend in 2017.<br />While some theaters in the U.S. have managed to reopen at limited capacity during the pandemic, others, including those in large metropolitan markets like New York City and Los Angeles, have remained closed because of lockdowns as the pandemic thwarts consumers’ ability to return to public spaces.

Over the weekend, the U.K. initiated more lockdowns in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, even as the nation recently began distributing a vaccine.<br />“Wonder Woman 1984” stars Gal Gadot as the titular character and is directed by Patty Jenkins. Immersed in the glitz and excess of 1980s America, the Amazonian warrior turned superhero is tasked with battling villains amid efforts to save the world. Buoyed by the on-screen chemistry between Ms. Gadot and co-star Chris Pine, the movie has received generally positive reviews, including a critics score exceeding 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, despite many grumbling about a two-and-half-hour run time.</td>

      <td>Commerce committee details agency lapses policing airlines and pilots, retaliation against those raising safety concerns</td>
      <td>A congressional panel issued a report documenting what it determined were safety-oversight lapses by the Federal Aviation Administration, from agency intimidation of federally protected whistleblowers to lax policing of maintenance errors.<br />The 101-page document, released Friday by the Senate Commerce committee, is sharply critical of FAA leadership’s handling of numerous matters over several years. The findings stem from the broadest review of agency enforcement efforts conducted in the wake of two fatal crashes of  Boeing Co. ’s 737 MAX jets.<br />Concluding that systemic FAA deficiencies pose an “unnecessary risk to the flying public,” the report cited a pattern of agency managers avoiding responsibility for failures to ensure proper staff training. Managers also undermined or overruled enforcement decisions of some inspectors, investigators determined.<br />“When inspectors pushed back,” according to the report, “they were investigated and in some cases reassigned.”<br />After examining some 13,000 pages of documents and interviewing dozens of agency employees, investigators described a “failed FAA safety management culture” tending to favor companies over FAA staff and “often accompanied by retaliation against those who report safety violations.”</td>

      <td>Trying to salvage his relationship with regulators in a Nov. 2 meeting, the Chinese billionaire said he was ready to do what the country needed</td>
      <td>As Jack Ma was trying to salvage his relationship with Beijing in early November, the beleaguered Chinese billionaire offered to hand over parts of his financial-technology giant, Ant Group, to the Chinese government, according to people with knowledge of the matter.<br />“You can take any of the platforms Ant has, as long as the country needs it,” Mr. Ma, China’s richest man, proposed at an unusual sit-down with regulators, the people said.<br />The offer, not previously reported, appeared a mea culpa of sorts from Mr. Ma as he found himself face to face with officials from China’s central bank and agencies overseeing securities, banking and insurance. The Nov. 2 meeting took place a few days before Ant was supposed to go public, in what would have been the world’s biggest initial public offering.<br />Mr. Ma had angered Beijing by lashing out in a speech in October at President Xi Jinping’s signature campaign to control financial risks, saying it stifled innovation. Now, the regulators had called the meeting to voice their concerns about Ant’s business model.<br />His olive-branch offer at the meeting failed at saving the IPO and Beijing has since stepped up efforts to rein in China’s Big Tech giants.</td>

      <td>I voted to exempt Jim Mattis from the law but won’t repeat that mistake with Lloyd Austin.</td>
      <td>On Jan. 13, 2017, I voted to allow retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis to serve as secretary of defense. Like every Marine of my generation, I looked up to Gen. Mattis as the embodiment of the Marine Corps ethos. I still do. But I have come to believe that my vote was a mistake. Congress was wrong to exempt him from a legal prohibition on recently retired military officers serving as defense secretary. And Congress shouldn’t do the same for President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee, retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin.<br />Before Secretary Mattis, Congress had allowed only one exemption since passing the 1947 National Security Act, for Army Gen. George Marshall in 1950. Voting to allow a second exception didn’t seem like much of a threat to civil-military relations. Yet with the benefit of hindsight, I can see how Gen. Mattis’s tenure departed from norms in important ways. Despite my enormous respect for him and the exceptional National Defense Strategy he wrote at the Pentagon, his time as secretary reinforced why recently retired officers shouldn’t serve in this role.<br />Like many military officers, Secretary Mattis never seemed interested in the cabinet politics that come with the position. He avoided fights with fiscal hawks in the White House over defense spending, even as defense hawks in Congress begged him to make the case for additional dollars.<br />Secretary Mattis seemed to run the Pentagon like it was a combatant command. After hundreds of billions in defense cuts under the Obama administration, he rightly made a priority of improving readiness. But that came at the expense of long-term overhaul, despite bipartisan support for efforts like growing the Navy to 355 ships.<br />Additionally, Gen. Mattis brought a warfighting-first perspective to public relations. With no background in politics, he undervalued the importance of engaging the public on national-security issues and scaled back the department’s public release of information. This had the perverse effect of reducing the department’s ability to persuade Congress and the public in important bureaucratic fights.</td>
