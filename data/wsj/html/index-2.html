      <td>Customers of Mimecast were targeted in cyberattack, showing the multiple layers of potential victims at risk in massive hack</td>
      <td>A breach at email security provider Mimecast Inc. underscores that Russia-linked hackers appear to have targeted victims along multiple avenues of attack in what is shaping up to be one of the most successful cyber campaigns of U.S. government and corporate systems.<br />The attack potentially adds thousands of victims to the yearslong intelligence operation and likely aimed at gaining access to email systems, security experts say. Mimecast, in a Tuesday blog post, said the hackers were able to obtain a digital certificate used by the company to access its customers’  Microsoft  365 office productivity services.<br />The Mimecast hackers used tools and techniques that link them to the hackers who broke into Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds Corp., according to people familiar with the investigation. The link to the SolarWinds hackers was reported earlier by Reuters.<br />U.S. government officials have blamed Russia for the SolarWinds attack. Moscow has denied involvement.<br />Most of the companies and government agencies identified as victims to date were compromised via a piece of network management software called Orion that belongs to SolarWinds. But the Mimecast case, in which the vendor’s customers became targets, highlights that not all victims had to be SolarWinds users themselves to be targeted.</td>

But the Trump administration, which opposes abortion rights, left in place regulations requiring women to make in-person visits to a hospital, clinic or physician’s office to pick up mifepristone, one of two drugs used to induce a medication abortion.<br />The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an organization of women’s health-care physicians, and other groups sued the FDA over its exclusion of mifepristone, also known by the brand name Mifeprex.<br />The group’s president, Dr. Eva Chalas, said patients should be able to obtain mifepristone, like other drugs, through mail delivery.</td>

      <td>The storming of the U.S. Capitol last week has left millions of Americans wondering about the health of their democracy. Now imagine the damage if this is followed by political violence across the country leading up to the inauguration.<br />That’s the worry caused by an FBI warning about armed protests planned for all 50 states and the U.S. Capitol starting Jan. 16—with a threat of a “huge uprising” if President Trump is removed via the 25th amendment.<br />The warning comes via an internal FBI bulletin that reads in part: “On 8 January, the FBI received information on an identified group calling for others to join them in ‘storming’ state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in the event POTUS is removed as President prior to Inauguration Day. This identified group is also planning to ‘storm’ government offices including in the District of Columbia and in every state, regardless of whether the states certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump, on 20 January.”<br />It’s hard to know what to make of this without insight into the actors, but after last week governors, mayors and police will have to take it seriously. That means mobilizing the resources and manpower to keep law enforcement from being overwhelmed.<br />The moment also requires calls for restraint and nonviolence from both the left and right. Steve Scalise, the second-ranking Republican in the House and himself a victim of a politically motivated shooter, makes his plea nearby for politicians to tone down rhetoric that can inspire violence.</td>

      <td>Most Americans know little about modern Asian history. That’s too bad—yesterday’s upheavals are likely to be tomorrow’s, too.</td>
      <td>Modern Asian history may be the most important subject that most educated Americans know almost nothing about. With the center of gravity of world politics now firmly located in the Indo-Pacific, many are looking for ways to deepen their understanding of the most populous, fastest-growing and potentially most dangerous region in the world. Tim Harper’s “Underground Asia: Global Revolutionaries and the Assault on Empire” is an excellent place to start. It is a clearly written, brilliantly researched examination of the people and movements that shaped Asia’s course in the 20th century and continue to influence the continent today.<br />In the early part of the century, when Mr. Harper’s narrative begins, European colonialism seemed permanently established in Asia. In 1906, the power of the Netherlands in what is now Indonesia reached its grim apogee as Dutch forces shelled the royal capital of the ancient Balinese kingdom of Badung until the battered, unarmed defenders, in a final act of defiance, “processed out of the palace and threw themselves, singing, at the Dutch automatic weapons.” An estimated 1,000 were killed.<br />The early arrival of the Industrial Revolution had given western nations, especially Britain, what appeared to be an insurmountable industrial, economic, political and military supremacy. Prospectors, planters, industrialists, missionaries and soldiers descended on traditional Asian societies and, shunting hapless native rulers aside almost everywhere, began to modernize Asia to suit western needs. Steamship lines connected ports; vast urban complexes grew up where trade routes crossed; and railroads carried the agents, the goods and the ideas of empire deep into the countryside.<br />European power in Asia looked unshakable, but only 43 years after the fall of Badung the Dutch were forced to recognize Indonesian independence amid the abject regional collapse of European rule.<br />How Asia’s ragtag revolutionaries turned that fierce desire for freedom into movements that could overcome European advantages in technology and organization is the story Mr. Harper wants to tell. It’s an ambitious assignment. Then as now, Asia was an overwhelmingly diverse region, and those differences were in many cases exacerbated by the ways that French, Dutch, British and Japanese colonialism overwrote preexisting cultural linkages with new patterns and influences. Often relying on colonial police archives, Mr. Harper reconstructs the obscure lives of the revolutionary generation who hammered out the ideas and built the movements that would lead Asia through the astonishingly rapid destruction of some of the largest and most powerful empires the world had ever seen.</td>

      <td>Delivering shots by age will help the most vulnerable faster.</td>
      <td>The Trump Administration said Tuesday it would release vaccine doses that it had been holding back for second inoculations and send more shots to states that are administering them faster. Thank you. This should speed up vaccinations by putting more pressure on states to relax the bureaucratic and political controls that have slowed the rollout.<br />“Every vaccine dose that is sitting in a warehouse rather than going into an arm could mean one more life lost or one more hospital bed occupied,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a press briefing. He’s right. Only 9.3 million of the 27.7 million vaccine doses that have been shipped to states have been administered.<br />Blame convoluted and rigid eligibility rules that have focused too much on “equity”—i.e., politics. Operation Warp Speed apportions doses to states, and then states decide how to allocate them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance to states on how to prioritize vaccines focuses on worker occupation, but many states have added to the morass.<br />New York has been one of the worst, creating a complex formula for ranking health-care employees based on underlying risk factors, age, occupation and hospital department, among other things. Many hospitals had spare vaccines because large numbers of health-care workers declined to be vaccinated. Yet state rules barred offering shots to others.<br />The  Pfizer  and Moderna mRNA shots have to be used within hours of opening vials. When hospitals and clinics had leftover shots after vaccinating everyone who wanted one, nurses often had to go on a scavenger hunt to find someone in the Governor’s top priority group. Many doses went to waste, and hundreds were left unopened on shelves.</td>

      <td>Obama’s engagement failed to change Havana’s behavior.</td>
      <td>After a five-year hiatus, the State Department on Monday returned Cuba to its list of state sponsors of terrorism. What took so long?<br />State’s practice of listing countries that “have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism” has been in place since 1979. President Reagan added the tropical communist regime in 1982. Cuba remained so designated until President Obama removed it from the list in 2015 in its campaign to normalize relations. But Havana doesn’t want to be normal, and it has deepened and broadened its commitment to terrorism.<br />The collapse of Venezuela’s democracy over two decades has been run out of Havana by Cuba’s military-intelligence apparatus. The once-sovereign South American nation is now essentially a Cuban satellite used as a base for transnational crime and terrorism. A 2019 report by the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism found that “Cuba and Venezuela continued to provide permissive environments for terrorists.”<br />The report noted that “individuals linked” to dissident members of the Colombian drug-trafficking group FARC, “who remain committed to terrorism notwithstanding the peace accord,” as well as the smaller rebel National Liberation Army (ELN) and “Hizballah sympathizers” were in Venezuela. Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro, who survives in power thanks to Cuba, “has openly welcomed former FARC leaders who announced a return to terrorist activities,” the report said.<br />Cuba also welcomes and protects terrorists at home. “Members of the ELN who were in Havana to conduct peace talks with the Colombian government since 2017 also remained in Cuba,” the report found. “Cuba, citing peace negotiation protocols, refused Colombia’s request to extradite 10 ELN leaders after that group claimed responsibility for the January 2019 bombing of a Bogotá police academy, which killed 22 and injured 87 others.”</td>

So watch for efforts to exploit Americans’ outrage at the Capitol assault in service of tactics that seek to spread the blame far and wide for political or ideological ends.<br />Stuart Stevens, a senior advisor to the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, tweeted Saturday that “we are constructing a database of Trump officials & staff that will detail their roles in the Trump administration & track where they are now.” He added: “No personal info, only professional. But they will be held accountable & not allowed to pretend they were not involved.”<br />The Lincoln Project is a well-funded political action group, run mostly by former GOP consultants, that made ads for Democrats in the 2020 election cycle. We often disagreed, especially with the group’s effort to unseat principled GOP Senators, but never begrudged donors exercising their First Amendment right to influence the political process.<br />It’s something else to turn fire on former public servants in private life. Mr. Stevens tells us in an email that he’s doing nothing more than Wikipedia does with its pages listing past Administration alumni. But then why broadcast his stigmatizing intentions?<br />The only reason for an anti-Trump group to publicize the employment information of former officials is to deter employers from hiring them. If they are hired, progressive employees could scour the list and create petitions for them to be fired or doxed. This will deepen America’s civic strife.</td>

      <td>Danes face threats from Beijing for planning a fake climate crisis to help Ted Hui get to the West.</td>
      <td>‘We say the Chinese Communist Party got cheated by two Danish boys,” says Thomas Rohden, 25. Last month, he and his friend Anders Storgaard, 26, masterminded a plan to sneak a dissident out of Hong Kong. For pulling off a daring feat, they may face consequences that reveal much about Beijing’s global ambitions.<br />Messrs. Rohden and Storgaard belong to opposing political parties, but both are members of the Danish China Critical Society, a group focused on the Communist Party’s human-rights abuses. The two men met Hong Kong opposition members visiting Copenhagen last February. “That opened my eyes to how important it is for us young people who are democratically involved to stick together,” Mr. Storgaard says.<br />They kept in touch with Ted Hui, a 38-year-old pro-democracy lawmaker. All three are as mischievous as they are principled—Mr. Hui once set off a stink bomb during a Legislative Council session as an act of protest against legislation that threatened free expression.<br />Supporters of the freedom movement in Hong Kong have repeatedly been assaulted since 2019, and Mr. Hui noticed strangers had begun to follow him and his family. Police arrested him numerous times for protesting in the streets and in the Legislative Council. Mr. Hui got out on bail, but greater legal peril loomed. Last summer Beijing imposed a national-security law on Hong Kong that outlaws all forms of dissent, on penalty of life in prison. (Mr. Hui hasn’t been charged under that law.)<br />Messrs. Rohden and Storgaard contacted their friend after he was released on bail. Mr. Hui responded with a strange suggestion. As a former member of the Legislative Council’s Environmental Affairs Panel, he wanted to come to Denmark to talk about climate change. Beijing purports to care about the environment, and Mr. Storgaard and Mr. Rohden intuited this might be a chance for Mr. Hui to escape. So they made an audacious plan: to stage a fake climate conference in Copenhagen in early December, invite their friend, and get him to safety.</td>

      <td>The man who shot me in 2017 and the Capitol Hill rioters all were radicalized by extreme rhetoric.</td>
      <td>I’m still angry after last week’s events at the Capitol. I mourn for Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died from injuries inflicted by rioters, and worry about the morale and safety of his fellow officers. My concerns continue for the safety of my colleagues, staff and members of the press who work in Washington. President Trump should have denounced the attack unequivocally as it was taking place.<br />What happened last Wednesday went well beyond any candidate’s legal right to contest an election and is another glaring sign that public discourse has gotten out of control. With only days to go until President-elect Biden’s Inauguration, our national temperature is far too high. A powder keg had been smoldering long before Wednesday’s events. For the sake of our country, politicians and media figures—of both parties—have to tone down their rhetoric.<br />In 2017, I was shot on a baseball field by a politically motivated gunman. The deranged shooter was heavily influenced by the demonization of congressional Republicans by some Democratic politicians, whose statements were amplified by the mainstream media. In the aftermath of my shooting, I made a conscious decision not to hold anybody but the gunman responsible for that day’s events.<br />It would, however, be naive to think the shooter arrived at his decision in a vacuum. It would be equally naive to think that the Capitol rioters arrived at their decisions in a void. Violent rhetoric helps radicalize people. Republicans and Democrats alike must have the moral clarity to call this language out whenever it is spoken, not only when it comes from the other side of the political aisle.<br />Many Democrats who were rightfully quick to join us in condemning last week’s events at the Capitol were noticeably silent over the summer. In those months, Americans watched looters ransack small businesses while cities went up in flames. Radical progressives attacked police precincts and federal courthouses, and leftist protesters clashed repeatedly with police. In Minneapolis, Kenosha, Wis., Seattle’s “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,” the District of Columbia and other cities, many elected officials outright enabled a cruel disregard for life, property and the rule of law in the name of social justice. Many in the media cheered the violence. “Show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful,” CNN’s Chris Cuomo said.</td>

The House is preparing to cast a series of votes aimed at ousting or impeaching the president over his role in last week’s violence at the Capitol.<br />As concerns mount about the possibility of more riots around Inauguration Day, the president also called for “no violence,” after sending mixed messages on the riot in recent days. He condemned the violent protests in a taped video last week, before vowing that his supporters would “not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”<br />“We believe in respecting America’s history and traditions, not tearing them down,” Mr. Trump said. “We believe in the rule of law and not in violence.”<br />The president showed little regret for his actions ahead of last week’s riot, which followed a monthslong effort by Mr. Trump and his allies to rally his supporters with baseless claims of a rigged election. Speaking to reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before taking off for Texas, Mr. Trump denied any responsibility for the violence perpetrated by his supporters at the Capitol last week, saying his speech before the riot was “totally appropriate.”</td>

With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed.”<br />Judged against this standard, can impeaching President Trump and removing him from office succeed? A Quinnipiac University survey released on Monday suggests that it cannot.<br />Yes, 52% of Americans favor removing President Trump from office, compared with 45% who oppose it. But the partisan divisions are deep. While 89% of Democrats support this course, 87% of Republicans oppose it, and independents are split.<br />Underlying this stark divide are radically divergent interpretations of the November presidential election and its aftermath. Some 73% of Republicans believe that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Only 5% of Democrats do.<br />These dueling beliefs have consequences. Seventy-three percent of Republicans think that Mr. Trump’s actions since the election have aimed at protecting democracy; 95% of Democrats think that he has been undermining democracy.</td>

If it takes 50% more diligence to achieve the same virus-suppressing effect, you see the problem: Many people already find the current level of diligence unsustainable or not worth their effort.<br />It is pretty apparent that, in countries where social distancing cannot be enforced by bayonet or mega-Trumpian border control, cases are growing faster than hospital capacity. The vaccine has not (contrary to my hope) caused many to redouble their efforts with a light at the end of the tunnel. Millions who know better than ever now that most cases are mild or symptomless seem to be telling themselves, with the elderly being vaccinated, their own job is done.<br />A typical sentence since last summer has been: I went to the grocery store and everybody was wearing a mask. The first part of the sentence is the problematic part. People are crowding together again. A decline in social distancing has defeated an increase in mask wearing.<br />Celebrity is fickle even if you’re a coronavirus mutation. By July, the dominant variant in the U.S. and Europe had become different from the Chinese strain that served as the basis for our then-hatching vaccines. As it turns out, the vaccines nevertheless are potent against the “G” strain and likely to be against the celebrated new mutation from the U.K. But it won’t be true of future variants. Once a vaccine starts going into millions of arms, that’s when selective pressure ramps up on a virus to defeat our vaccines. Interestingly, though scientists aren’t sure whether natural or artificial vaccination confers better immunity, they’re pretty sure the natural kind will prove more robust against evolution because it responds to a broader diversity of virus features.<br />More information is always helpful. Multiple experts, in honor of the newly recognized variant, want accelerated genomic sampling to hunt for new strains. Great idea. But it does underline our odd indifference toward measuring current spread accurately. Joe Biden, the Brits and others suddenly are realizing their dainty and over-categorizing answers about who should get the vaccine first are slowing its delivery. Also hurting is the likelihood that one-third of people soon to be lining up will already have been vaccinated by nature, many of them not knowing it.</td>

      <td>The complete recordings—all 775 hours—of the historic Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders has been released online.</td>
      <td>Hermann Göring’s German speaking voice is pinched, high-pitched, pedantic. He snaps condescendingly at the prosecutor who presents him with one wartime document after another: “I have to read it first.” “No, that is in no way correctly translated.” “Here is a mistake already.” “That is not quite correct.”<br />In these, his final public appearances—as a defendant in the International Military Tribunal Trial of Major War Criminals held in Nuremberg, Germany, from November 1945 to October 1946—he speaks with almost singsong mockery, as if he were looking down at lesser mortals. He relishes tweaking the U.S. chief prosecutor and justice of the Supreme Court, Robert H. Jackson, derailing his lines of questioning with challenges over trivia. Göring is so petty and pettifogging, you can almost forget that he had been the demonic creator of the Gestapo, the supreme commander of the Luftwaffe and Hitler’s chosen successor.<br />Göring was one of 24 high-level political and military Nazi leaders put on trial (two of the defendants never made it to the dock—one because of suicide, the other because of illness). Following the verdicts of judges from the four Allied powers (the U.S., Britain, France and the Soviet Union), 10 were hanged, three were acquitted and others were given long sentences. Martin Bormann—Hitler’s private secretary—rumored to be dead (as he was) was sentenced to death in absentia. And Göring notoriously cheated the executioner, killing himself the night before his scheduled trip to the gallows.<br />Hearing these voices as they accuse, excuse, avoid, rationalize and lie is quite different from reading the trial record. English transcripts have long been available as part of Yale University’s Avalon Project and as part of the Nuremberg records at the Library of Congress. Now, during the trial’s 75th anniversary, the complete recordings have been put online for the first time by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, along with the 37 reels of film introduced into evidence at the trial. The International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, the custodian of the original materials—1,942 gramophone discs containing 775 hours of hearings—arranged the digitization of its archive, collaborating with the Holocaust museum in Washington and the Mémorial de la Shoah in Paris.<br />It isn’t easy listening, and not only because the museum’s awkward web presentation makes any selective exploration difficult. While the trial employed simultaneous translation of German, English, French and Russian—the first time the technique was used on this scale—these recordings do not provide any benefit of translation or captioning; nonquadrilingual listeners must consult transcripts from other sites. But what is heard, even now, seems remarkable: a rough first draft of judgment, beginning just five months after the war with Germany ended and unfolding over nearly a year as its arbiters strained to fit minimal forms of existing law to maximal forms of moral degradation.</td>

      <td>Netflix’s grim four-part docuseries highlights the forensic work of detectives Frank Salerno and Gil Carrillo, who ultimately identified the erratic killer.</td>
      <td>That television is acrawl with serial killers probably says something unpleasant about our shared capacity for morbid fascination. It might even represent an extreme version of the “there-but-for-the-grace-of-God” attraction of so much reality TV. But some cases can stand up to repeated revisiting, notably that of the so-called Night Stalker, which has now been the subject of at least half a dozen film and TV adaptations, one of which starred Richard Jordan and A Martinez as detectives Frank Salerno and Gil Carrillo.<br />The real-life Carrillo and Salerno are the stars, so to speak, of the four-part Netflix series “Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,” which director Tiller Russell adorns with an excess of boogeyman visuals and ominous music, but which provides a cop’s-eye view of why the case remains so interesting. “We’d never encountered someone like that,” says Mr. Salerno, alluding to the methodologies of Richard Ramirez, which were so varied and random they offered up no immediate connections between the crimes or any obvious profile of the killer himself. Ramirez, who died in prison in 2013, shot people in their sleep, sexually assaulted his victims, beat them viciously, dragged one out of her car in traffic and shot her; he abducted children, molested them but let them live (usually) while killing his adult targets; he mutilated, burglarized and his weapons ranged from guns and knives to hammers and tire irons. Police investigators such as Messrs. Salerno and Carrillo were accustomed to suspects who exhibited specific homicidal pathologies. Ramirez, who terrorized Los Angeles and San Francisco in 1984 and ’85, seemed to have them all.<br />The process by which the detectives finally linked up the various crimes is the narrative engine of “Night Stalker,” which provides quite a bit of background on the police officers, and some crazily moody portraiture, but also gives us a glimpse inside the investigative mind. Mr. Carrillo tells us that during the course of his academic study of criminal psychology he learned that there was a certain deviancy that thrived on the frightened look on a victim’s face—something that had been a distinctive aspect of several of the crimes. Mr. Salerno, who was instrumental in cracking the Hillside Strangler case of the ’70s and so had considerable experience with multiple murderers, recalls Ramirez committing one home invasion in which he stopped, mid-mayhem, to fix himself something to eat. “That’s a pretty sick individual,” Mr. Salerno says, not meaning to be funny.<br />The tracking of the killer’s footprints—left by what turned out to be a pair of very distinctive Avia sneakers—becomes an obsession, both for the detectives and for us. It was also the kind of detail they had to strive to keep out of the media, lest Ramirez, who obviously followed his own coverage and left very few clues behind, stop wearing the shoes. The police cut deals with the press and TV outlets to keep certain details from the public, but they couldn’t control politicians: When it became clear that Ramirez had relocated to San Francisco, then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein held a news conference in which she “vomited” details of the crimes that had been shared by the two cities. The resentment of the cops seems as fresh today as it must have been then.<br />So, yes, there’s a bit of payback at play in “Night Stalker,” especially regarding the Los Angeles Police Department. Detectives Carrillo and Salerno, who were with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, recall several instances where information wasn’t shared, or incompetence ruled the day. A car that probably contained Ramirez’s fingerprints was kept in an outdoor LAPD lot, undusted, until its usefulness as evidence was destroyed. A dentist’s office to which Ramirez was sure to return—he had an impacted tooth—was staked out by Sheriff’s officers, but they were replaced for budgetary reasons by an LAPD alarm. The dentist was to use it if and when Ramirez returned. Which he did. And the alarm malfunctioned. “So we missed him,” Mr. Carrillo says, generously.</td>

      <td>Kyra Sedgwick stars as an over-intrusive, overly forward mom in ABC’s new sitcom.</td>
      <td>From June Cleaver, Edith Bunker and Clair Huxtable to Morticia Addams, Peg Bundy and Marge Simpson, the TV mom as an institution has been a source of warmth, solace and neuroses. While the characters in question were usually busy being moms, there have been empty-nesters, too, and ones with no sense of boundaries: Endora (“Bewitched”) would arrive unannounced in a puff of smoke; Marie Barone (“Everybody Loves Raymond”) lived next door, though one could hardly ever tell.<br />In “Call Your Mother,” Kyra Sedgwick plays Jean Raines, intrusive mother extraordinaire: When she can’t get her son, Freddie (Joey Bragg), on the phone for four days she packs her bags and leaves for Los Angeles. Are her relocated children happy to see her? Is it sunny in L.A.? What’s clear, partly through Ms. Sedgwick’s portrayal—a mix of Midwest nice and East Coast anxious—is that Jean is as eager to leave Iowa as her kids were, especially after a decade or so as a single parent and nothing else to do.<br />Two things are immediately evident in the pilot for the show, which was created by Kari Lizer (“The New Adventures of Old Christine”). One, it’s a pandemic production: The airport where Jean says goodbye to her pal Sharon (Sherri Shepherd) is just a facade; every apartment in L.A. seems to be the same set, with the furniture moved around. It’s an underpopulated program, although there’s something heartening, too, about imagining everyone off camera in face masks, distancing and trying to get a show on the air. The other thing that seems apparent is how difficult it will be to sustain sufficient energy with mom in the center ring. All the mothers cited above were sidekicks, or part of an ensemble, but Ms. Sedgwick seems positioned to carry most of the burden, and other than Jean being meddlesome or looking for a sex life—or delivering mawkish soliloquies about the importance of family—there aren’t any obvious avenues to be followed. On the other hand, only the one episode was available for review, so they might fool us all. Let’s hope.<br />There is a potential love interest—Danny (Patrick Brammall) her “host,” in the Airbnb sense, who warns that his dog has a tendency to hump. “So do I,” Jean replies, and Danny, to his credit, looks taken aback. I have to admit I was startled, likewise, when Jean calls a belligerent driver at the airport a “dick.” Much worse can be heard almost everywhere on television, but on a network show? It’s still a little shocking. What would Carol Brady have thought?</td>

And it would give Mr. Trump agency, a la Richard Nixon, over his own fate.” Of what high crime or misdemeanor has my president been accused: Of inciting a riot? How exactly? Of somehow failing to speak some magic formula to the mainstream press within a few moments after being informed of a chaotic crisis (which you exaggerate as an “assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election”)? But he hasn’t been shown to have initiated, condoned or sanctioned anything more than a peaceful demonstration. Why then is he supposed to admit culpability in this affair and resign in disgrace?<br />Tactically, it might be beneficial for him to hand the presidency to Vice President Mike Pence and accept a full pardon, a la Nixon. But to do so would destroy a movement that he nurtured and which is far from moribund, for his own personal convenience. Time will vindicate Donald Trump, but this editorial won’t be forgotten in this household long after Mr. Trump leaves office.<br />David deForrest<br />Jacksonville, Fla.</td>

The shares will be sold by the company, and Zoom included the typical boiler plate explanation in its filing that the proceeds would be used for “working capital and general corporate purposes,” with the possibility that the money also could help fund acquisitions though no current deals are in the works.<br />Zoom’s videoconferencing business is still booming, in large part because of Covid-19, but investors are already grappling with what post-pandemic life could mean for the company. The once-highflying stock is now 40% off its mid-October peak. And while still richly valued at around 30 times forward sales, it is no longer the most premium play among cloud stocks. At least a dozen now carry higher multiples relative to projected sales.<br />But Zoom is still valued at close to $100 billion, a level that software companies don’t typically reach until they have established multiple lines of business. So the company still faces some pressure to show it is no one trick pony.<br />The company disclosed Tuesday that it has now sold 1 million seats for its Zoom Phone service, which replaces office telephone systems. That is a potentially huge market, but also one with very well-entrenched competitors along with newer challengers such as  Microsoft ,  Google and  RingCentral .</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday considered expanding the financial liability that public colleges and other government entities can face for infringing free-speech rights, even after they repeal restrictions challenged as unconstitutional.<br />In 2016, a student at Georgia Gwinnett College began passing out religious literature on a campus plaza, only to be stopped by a police officer who told him to reserve one of two tiny so-called speech zones for such activities. Later, when the student did so, he said, another officer stopped him from speaking because of complaints over his remarks.<br />The student, Chike Uzuegbunam, sued the Lawrenceville, Ga., school for violating his First Amendment rights. College administrators reversed course, opening the entire campus to student speech with minimal restrictions, and a federal judge dismissed the case as moot. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, upheld that decision.<br />That left Mr. Uzuegbunam, who since has graduated, without a dollar in compensation from the college—and, a dollar, what courts call nominal compensation, is what he was seeking. More significantly, it frustrated the advocacy group representing him, Alliance Defending Freedom, from collecting attorneys’ fees and costs from the school.<br />In that the policy had been rescinded and Mr. Uzuegbunam obtained his degree, several justices questioned whether there were any grounds for damages.</td>

      <td>Nonprofit can seek review from full court after three-judge decision</td>
      <td>A Philadelphia nonprofit can’t open the nation’s first sanctioned, supervised site for drug users because the concept violates federal drug law, a three-judge federal appeals-court panel ruled.<br />Tuesday’s decision raised another barrier for the nonprofit Safehouse, which has long planned what is commonly called a safe-injection site to combat fatal drug overdoses, but has faced legal opposition and other delays. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said in a 2-1 ruling that only federal lawmakers can make such a site legal.<br />“Its motives are admirable,” Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote for the majority, regarding Safehouse. “But Congress has made it a crime to open a property to others to use drugs.”<br />Safehouse aims to open a site that would offer broad support for drug users, including a room where they can take drugs with supervision so that someone can quickly intervene and treat an overdose. Supporters say the concept, already used in places like Europe and Canada but novel in the U.S., will save lives and help people get access to treatment.<br />Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia sued two years ago, arguing Safehouse would violate part of a 1986 antidrug law that makes it illegal to knowingly host illicit drug use and other drug-related activity. Safehouse won a favorable lower-court ruling in late 2019, but the appeals-court panel’s majority sided with local U.S. Attorney William McSwain’s interpretation of the law.</td>

      <td>The Health and Human Services Department will start collecting hospital data on how many health-care personnel and patients have gotten Covid-19 vaccines amid a faltering national push to widely and quickly immunize the public.<br />The agency on Tuesday unveiled the change that asks hospitals to report once a week on progress immunizing health-care personnel and patients. Data won’t initially be made public for individual hospitals, according to senior HHS officials. HHS expects to make the data public after verifying its quality, they said.<br />Hospital workers were among the first to be immunized from the limited early U.S. supply of vaccines because of their exposure to the virus and critical work. But the national rollout of vaccines has been slow and rocky. Hospitals largely haven’t mandated workers get the vaccine. Surveys show not all personnel are willing to be immunized.<br />Vaccinations through the end of last year reached about 2.8 million administered doses, far less than the federal goal of 20 million.<br />The Trump administration said Tuesday it would release additional vaccine supplies, and called for immunization of adults older than 65 and those with health issues that put them at risk. The extra vaccines are doses that had been set aside as the second of the two required shots.</td>

      <td>Yield on 10-year Treasury note still on course to rise for seventh consecutive trading session</td>
      <td>U.S. government-bond yields pared an early climb Tuesday after a Treasury Department auction of new 10-year notes met strong demand from investors.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed at 1.136% according to Tradeweb, down from above 1.18% before the sale. That is barely changed from 1.131% Monday.<br />Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, declined after asset managers and other buyers scooped up the majority of $38 billion worth of new government debt, leaving bond dealers with around 20% of the securities. Treasury prices often fall when dealers win larger shares at the auctions, a sign of weak demand from investors.<br />The 10-year yield, a key barometer for borrowing costs throughout the economy, still headed for a seventh consecutive daily gain, extending a march above 1% that began after Democrats won control of the Senate. The prospects for greater government spending, along with economic growth and inflation, helped push the yield out of its relatively narrow, post-pandemic range near all-time lows.<br />Asset managers were keenly watching the results of Tuesday’s auction to gauge whether the recent bond selloff would continue or whether yields will settle in a new range. Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said it marked “something of an inflection point for rates,” in a note to clients.</td>

He said the Church, state and society shared responsibility and that religious orders responsible should make a contribution to those seeking redress.<br />Some of the religious orders responsible for the homes issued apologies. The former Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, said “the church way outstepped its role and became a controlling church,” and should apologize, in comments to RTÉ, the Irish broadcaster.

      <td>Elite auction houses like Sotheby’s are betting on rare sneakers and sought-after streetwear. Here, what’s earned the highest hammer prices and how to spot items that could someday be worth a bundle.</td>
      <td>On Trend is a weekly column on men’s style that explores fashion’s subcultures and of-the-moment curiosities.<br />IN LATE December 2020, the venerated auction house Sotheby’s hosted an online-only sale of a pair of leather Adidas sneakers. Made in partnership with the 311-year-old porcelain-maker Meissen specifically for the auction, the shoes had been festooned with porcelain overlays and meticulously hand-painted with fanciful motifs from toe to heel, a six-month process that elevated humble sweat repositories to something approaching art. To the highest bidder, the sneakers were worth $126,000. (All proceeds went to the Brooklyn Museum.)<br />These extravagant Adidas shoes are among the sneakers and high-end streetwear pieces that have been infiltrating the tony auction market of late. In July 2019, Sotheby’s sold a historic set of  Nike ’s  “Moon Shoe” waffle-soled sneakers from 1972 for a then-record-setting $437,500. A pair of game-worn Michael Jordan sneakers has since sold for more.<br />Much of the streetwear now on the auction block was sold via traditional retail shops just a few years earlier—with their auction-hammer prices dwarfing their original prices. Last September, a 2017 Supreme hoodie made in partnership with Louis Vuitton sold at Sotheby’s in New York for $6,048, far more than the $935 it commanded at retail. In October at Bonhams in London, a pair of 2018 Nike x Off-White Jordan 1 sneakers fetched around $2,750, an increase of 1,347% over their $190 retail price. And in November 2019, a Supreme-branded Rimowa suitcase earned roughly $6,400 at Christie’s in Hong Kong. The suitcase had hit the retail market in 2018 at $1,800.<br />Treating sneakers as re-sellable assets is hardly a new concept. In the early 2000s Jordan Geller, the founder of sneaker museum Shoezeum, began buying sneakers at California swap meets to resell for profit on  eBay .  Internet flippers like him built out a big-money market for theretofore overlooked Nikes and Adidas as well as limited-run Supreme gear. Eventually, Mr. Geller amassed a mammoth personal collection of sneakers, including the Nike Moon Shoes that he would later sell through Sotheby’s for as much as a Picasso sketch.</td>

Ms. Marcy leads online classes on how to get rid of unnecessary items and on social media runs a private support group for people trying to organize their homes, a process that can be fraught with stress, guilt, resentment and grief, she says.<br />Ms. Marcy tells clients that when they start to unclutter their homes of physical possessions they inevitably will find connections to emotional, financial and relationship issues in their lives, too. “It’s all clutter and it’s all connected,” she says.<br />Ms. Marcy discussed how to navigate decluttering landmines, why you shouldn’t buy anything to get organized and how to deal with boxes of items that could draw tears. Edited excerpts:<br />How has the pandemic affected people’s relationship with clutter?<br />For some people it has sparked this idea that we need to stockpile. Others say “I’m going to lose my mind if I have to look at this stuff any longer.” There comes a point where stockpiling is more hazardous than not stockpiling. Physical hazards exist with clutter because you can trip, it creates dust and mold and it can be a fire hazard. Anybody who has lived through a natural disaster or any sort of emergency will             attest that skills are more important than stockpiles. We’re also realizing the importance of having functional space. We don’t tend to look at our space, except maybe our kitchen counters, as functional space. For years we’ve been converting space in our house to storage. Then we take away that ability to add a desk when we need to, for example.</td>

Mr. Trump was a thrice-married New York casino magnate, who had given thousands of dollars to liberal politicians including Chuck Schumer and Kamala Harris. Now he was poised to lead the Party of Reagan?<br />I had my own personal confrontations with Mr. Trump. In 2011 he called me a “loser.” I immediately phoned to remind the not-always successful developer that not winning at everything doesn’t make you a loser—that learning from your defeats makes you a winner. He told me I was “too conservative” and “too pro-life.” A few months later he endorsed Mitt Romney.<br />So when he was about to secure the 2016 nomination, conservatives like me needed reassurance that he would follow through on the campaign promises he was making. Much of that reassurance came in the form of Mike Pence.<br />I have known Mr. Pence for 20 years. He is a trusted conservative and, more important, a good man. He served in the House while I was in the Senate. In 2010, when we were both considering 2012 presidential runs, Mike and I had several conversations about our visions, the issues that were driving us to run, and the family considerations we were struggling with. Not until he decided to run for governor of Indiana did I feel compelled to seek the presidency.<br />We have seen the vice president’s hand in much of Mr. Trump’s accomplishments over the past four years. We saw the man who called me “too pro-life” become the most pro-life president, the first to address the March for Life. We saw it in the nomination of committed constitutionalists like Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And we saw it in the regulatory reforms the administration has made to improve the economic climate.</td>

      <td>The fight over who gets the shot first is slowing the rollout. Date of birth is the best proxy for level of risk.</td>
      <td>The distribution of Covid vaccines is proceeding slowly even as a new, faster-moving viral variant arrives from London. The number of vaccinations administered last month was less than 25% of the original projections, while Covid hospitalizations and deaths reached new highs across the country. Perhaps inoculations will pick up in the coming weeks, but this has been what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls “Phase A,” when the serum is reserved for two highly accessible, readily identifiable groups: health-care workers and nursing-home residents.<br />“Phase B” could be much worse. It is true that the CDC finally said on Tuesday that it would release doses initially held back for second injections and that the shots should be available to anyone over 65 and those with pre-existing conditions. But states still have wide latitude to set priorities. Many are still deliberating, and some have turned the question over to officials at the county or even hospital level. Other states are sorting the elderly between those who have two or more comorbidities and those who don’t.<br />In many states, essential workers have been assigned priority. They are spreaders, it is said. They encounter the public when policing the streets, stocking shelves at grocery stores, or teaching in schools. The definition of essential worker has at times expanded to include Uber drivers, meatpackers and all those in the retail and manufacturing industries. The head of the Texas Restaurant Association says prioritization should go to those helping to “feed Texans.”<br />Each addition and distinction may seem reasonable, but the cost in delay and confusion is high. Covid vaccinations are proving more complicated than the flu shot. Out of an abundance of caution, some hospitals are requiring recipients to be tested for Covid first, and then wait 15 minutes after the vaccination to check for an allergic reaction. Applying the Phase B regulations will add to these delays. How does a person prove employment or a health condition? Must pharmacies turn away applicants who lack supporting documentation? With all these delays, summer could come and go before Phase B ends and the general public can finally be vaccinated.<br />It is time for simplification. To deliver free vaccines with maximum speed, the health-care system needs to follow a simple rule that applies to everyone. Fortunately, such a rule is readily available: date of birth. The older the person, the higher the priority. One can prove one’s age simply by showing a driver’s license, Medicare or Medicaid card, or another form of identification. For most, that information is already embedded in the files of hospitals, pharmacies and doctors’ offices.</td>

      <td>Companies cut off from popular digital-service providers can struggle to find workarounds</td>
      <td>Parler, the social network popular among conservatives and other right-leaning users that was plunged into internet limbo this week, faces a technically complex and costly path to getting back online.<br />Amazon.com Inc.  booted the company from its cloud-computing service Sunday night, knocking Parler offline. To stay alive, the self-professed free-speech social platform must find a new vendor willing to host its data after some of the app’s users stoked last week’s deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters seeking to stop certification of the election results. Alternatively, Parler could build its own network infrastructure, although that approach could lead to further delays resuming its service.<br />Potential cloud operators other than Amazon include  Microsoft Corp.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google. The search-giant declined to comment. Last week it pulled Parler from its app store, saying some users’ content incited violence—the same argument Amazon made in withdrawing its service.<br />Parler was still using Microsoft email services as of Monday. Microsoft said it has had no contact with Parler about hosting its data and wouldn’t comment on customers using its email service.<br />Parler also wouldn’t run on  Oracle Corp.’s  growing cloud business, a person familiar with the matter said.</td>

      <td>The grocery chain owner is on a roll. Its next challenge will be to figure out which initiatives to focus on.</td>
      <td>Albertsons is spinning a lot of plates while the going is good. The question is what it will focus on when things get less easy.<br />The grocer, which also owns the Jewel-Osco and Safeway chains, exceeded analyst sales expectations for a second consecutive quarter, with identical-store sales increasing by 12.3% from a year earlier in the quarter ended Dec. 5. That exceeded the growth rate of  Kroger  and  Walmart  for the comparable period and was roughly 2 percentage points better than the broad industry, according to Evercore ISI.<br />Net income for the quarter came in almost 40% below Wall Street estimates, though that number looks much worse due to a charge to withdraw from a union pension fund. Excluding that impact, net income blew past expectations.<br />The grocery chain’s traditional focus on fresh products is continuing to pay off, with sales growth in that category higher than the total. That turns out to be an important advantage. As consumers across the board are making fewer shopping trips, those that pick up fresh produce tend to drop by stores more frequently, Albertsons noted in its Tuesday morning earnings call.<br />In other areas, Albertsons is still playing catch up. Digital sales continued to impress, growing 225% from a year earlier. It was the third consecutive quarter in which digital sales increased by more than 200%, though the caveat is that Albertsons’ started out with a smaller e-commerce base than some of its competitors.</td>

The order is expected to go into effect Jan. 26, according to a person familiar with the matter. The CDC and other administration officials were still completing the order.<br />The CDC order for universal testing of passengers, including for U.S. citizens returning from abroad, comes weeks after the Trump administration imposed a testing requirement for travelers from the U.K. over concerns about a more infectious strain of the virus that was detected there. Since then, the new strain has been found elsewhere in the world, and its presence in the U.S. has been confirmed.<br />The U.S. requirement comes during a difficult time for the aviation industry and international travelers who face a thicket of varied testing protocols and quarantine requirements around the world, including public-health advisories urging people to stay home.<br />U.S. airlines have voiced support for the new requirement but argued that ramped-up testing protocols should take the place of travel restrictions and quarantines to reduce the spread of Covid-19.</td>

Cybersecurity experts suspect preparations for the attack go back far longer. A month later, a version of the company’s Orion Platform software appears to have contained modifications designed to test the hackers ability to insert malicious code into the system. The code was added starting Feb. 20, 2020, SolarWinds said, and the compromised software was available to its customers by March 26, 2020.<br />Intelligence officials have said the attack was one of the most sophisticated cyber intrusions of U.S. systems they had seen.<br />SolarWinds, working with hired cybersecurity experts, said it reverse-engineered the malicious code, called Sunburst, allowing them to learn more about the hack. The Austin, Texas-based company said an analysis suggests that hackers circumvented detection by mimicking legitimate network traffic that was run through U.S. servers. It is still trying to establish how the code entered its software and went undetected, the company said.<br />The investigation showed that the hackers removed the code from the system in June. SolarWinds said it learned of the breach on Dec. 12.</td>

Many consumers are shopping for groceries less frequently, buying greater amounts of food when they do and at times splurging on premium food products.<br />“We continue to see fewer trips per household but larger baskets,” Albertsons Chief Executive Vivek Sankaran said Tuesday on a call with analysts.<br />Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons said sales at stores open at least 15 months, excluding fuel, rose 12.3% for the quarter ended Dec. 5. The sales growth reflected a slight decline from the prior quarter, when the company posted a 13.8% increase, but it beat expectations and was higher than sales growth at other grocers such as  Kroger Co.  and  Walmart Inc.<br />“We are encouraged that customers spending more time at home are looking to us,” Mr. Sankaran said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden’s trade policy will focus on helping American workers by ensuring trade agreements protect and enhance U.S. jobs—and not just ensure low prices of imported goods for consumers, his nominee for the top trade-policy job said Tuesday.<br />Katherine Tai, in her first speech since Mr. Biden nominated her for U.S. Trade Representative, said the new administration’s policy priorities also include confronting China over its trade practices and enforcing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed by President Trump last year with bipartisan support.<br />“The president-elect’s vision is to implement a worker-centered trade policy,” Ms. Tai said in a video-streamed speech to the National Foreign Trade Council, a business-advocacy group. “What it means in practice is that U.S. trade policy must benefit regular Americans, communities and workers. And that starts with recognizing that people are not just consumers. They are also workers and wage earners.”<br />The emphasis on protecting U.S. jobs was a guiding principle of the Trump administration’s trade policy, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Monday, in which he credited Ms. Tai for helping win Democratic support for the USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement.<br />Ms. Tai has spent much of her career in the government, first as a lawyer for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, then as a congressional staff member. Most recently, she was chief trade counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee.</td>

Even though Camp Robin Hood, located in Freedom, N.H., had a solid plan to create a safety bubble, Mr. Ratner knew there was a risk of a Covid outbreak.<br />After three rounds of testing, including one before camp, and strict enforcement of mask-wearing, director Richard Woodstein called everyone together, turned up the music and announced the good news: Everyone tested negative. Campers ripped off their masks, hugged each other and danced.<br />Mr. Ratner soon received a letter from his 11-year-old daughter Lila. That moment was one of the greatest days of her life, she wrote. “Right now I don’t feel like corona is a thing and I am so happy.”<br />Lila and her 13-year-old brother, Noah, who haven’t been to school in person since last March, are already signed up for summer 2021. “I feel much more confident than last year. I know what to expect,” says Mr. Ratner, an attorney in Potomac, Md.<br />Overnight camp has always been a way to give children an experience removed from the realities of everyday life—a place to run free, learn new things and make lifelong friendships. Rarely have such joys been as amplified as during the Covid-19 pandemic, as many students have felt isolated most of the year, spending their time in front of computers and away from peers, unable to participate in sports, music or drama.</td>

Vigtory will also be available to those outside of the FuboTV subscriber base. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.<br />FuboTV launched about six years ago as a way for Americans to stream foreign soccer games, only to become a fully fledged alternative to the traditional cable-TV package. It competes with other over-the-internet bundles, including  Alphabet Inc.’s  YouTube TV,  Walt Disney Co. ’s Hulu + Live TV and  AT&T Inc.’s  AT&T TV Now. The company does have a broader emphasis on foreign sports—particularly soccer—than most of its competitors.<br />Many media companies have been teaming up with online sportsbooks, which are operated by digital companies such as  DraftKings Inc.  and FanDuel Group and bricks-and-mortar casino operators. Sportsbooks are growing in popularity as sports wagering expands across the U.S., a practice that has so far been legalized in 25 states and the District of Columbia. The U.S. sports-betting market is projected to reach about $13.5 billion by 2025, based on 38 states legalizing sports wagering by then, according to an estimate from  MGM Resorts International .<br />Last fall ESPN reached a deal with DraftKings and  Caesars Entertainment Inc.  to connect its audience to the gambling operators’ sportsbooks across digital platforms. Shortly after, DraftKings and Turner Networks, a unit of AT&T Inc.’s WarnerMedia, formed a similar partnership.</td>

The protesters say they are worried the laws dismantle a government safety net that attempts to guarantee that even small farmers will have a place to sell their produce at a fair price. New Delhi says the rules are aimed at deregulating and modernizing the agricultural markets.<br />The Supreme Court, by ordering for a committee to be formed, has effectively backed an approach that the government has repeatedly offered to farmers as a way out of the impasse. Farm leaders and government officials have already met several times without success.<br />“While we may not stifle a peaceful protest, we think that the extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest, at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihoods,” the court order said.</td>

On Tuesday, the government also blocked all social-media channels.<br />The contest embodies a generational clash across Africa, where entrenched older leaders are grappling with increasingly restless youthful populations demanding improved economic opportunities. Mr. Museveni disparagingly calls Mr. Wine, “my grandson” while the rapper taunts the president as “an aging dictator,” who should leave power to avoid the fate of Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe or Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi.<br />“I am the representative of the future,” Mr. Wine said. “The struggle is Africa’s generational cause and we shouldn’t retreat.”</td>

      <td>One of the world’s richest men, he was a big donor to the Republican Party</td>
      <td>Billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a giant in the casino-resort industry and one of the largest donors to the Republican Party, has died at the age of 87.<br />As a young man, Mr. Adelson seemed to lack focus. The son of an immigrant Jewish cabdriver, he flitted from one business to another, dabbling in mortgage brokerage, investment advice, venture capital, real estate, chartered tours and sales of De-Ice-It spray for windshields.<br />In his mid-30s, Mr. Adelson began finding his way as an entrepreneur who would become one of the world’s richest men, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $35.9 billion. He made himself into a giant in the casino industry with his lucrative resorts, one of the largest donors to the Republican Party, a leading backer of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a newspaper publisher in Nevada and Israel.<br />Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced the death of its chairman and chief executive in a statement Tuesday, less than a week after the company said he was taking a medical leave for cancer treatment. In March 2019, the company said Mr. Adelson had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.<br />His unlikely rise from obscurity began when he launched a trade publication for data-communications firms in the 1970s. Mr. Adelson noticed that other publishers sponsored trade shows. So, in 1979, near the beginning of the personal-computer boom, he launched Computer Dealers Exposition, or Comdex, which became a hugely successful trade exhibit held in Las Vegas and other cities. In 1988, needing space for his own exhibition center in Las Vegas to accommodate growing crowds, he bought the Sands hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip for $110 million, opening up a new line of business.</td>

      <td>If golf courses and resorts struggle to attract and keep members, it would weigh on the overall Trump Organization</td>
      <td>The storming of the Capitol last week by a pro-Trump mob will ratchet up the pressure on President Trump’s family business at a moment when some of his most lucrative assets were already suffering from the pandemic and facing looming debt payments.<br />One of the Trump Organization’s most loyal partners, German lender  Deutsche Bank AG , is moving to distance itself from the president’s businesses and is unlikely to lend it more money, says a person familiar with the matter. The bank has lent the Trump Organization more than $300 million that will mature in 2023 and 2024, forcing the company to refinance the debt or pay it off by potentially selling assets.<br />The other risk to the Trump Organization is that some customers stop patronizing its businesses, in particular its hotels and golf courses. The company has tried to sell its Washington, D.C., hotel, but the pandemic made buyers wary. The hotel was popular with supporters of Mr. Trump and with organizations trying to seek favor from the president. Business had already been expected to decline there once Mr. Trump leaves office.<br />The Trump Organization’s golf courses and resorts are particularly important, accounting for nearly half of the company’s annual revenue. The courses are closely associated with the president and have used his name to attract customers in a weak market for golf. If the courses struggle to attract and keep members, it would weigh on the Trump Organization overall.<br />On Sunday, PGA of America said it was terminating an agreement to hold the 2022 PGA Championship at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, citing risk to its brand of being affiliated with Mr. Trump. The Trump Organization said that the PGA’s decision was a “breach of a binding contract.”</td>

Former Attorney General William Barr and other federal law-enforcement officials have said there was no evidence of fraud in Michigan or elsewhere sufficient to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss to President-elect Joe Biden.<br />Lawyers for the city of Detroit last week asked a federal judge in Michigan’s Eastern District to reprimand the lawyers who brought one of the lawsuits alleging fraud—including Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood, who worked with the Trump campaign—and to refer them for disbarment and impose financial penalties.<br />“The extent of the factual and legal errors in this complaint would warrant sanctions under any circumstances, but here the court’s processes are being perverted to undermine our democracy and to upset the peaceful transfer of power,” Detroit’s lawyer, David Fink, wrote to U.S. District Judge Linda V. Parker.<br />The lawsuit was filed on behalf of several Michigan voters, claiming that Michigan election officials used election software designed by foreign dictators to manipulate the vote, along with other unproven illegal conduct at the polls.</td>

While some of these companies authorized buying back their own shares even before the coronavirus pandemic, they are betting that with a vaccine rollout under way, travel, office work and mall shopping will bounce back after a terrible year for major property types.<br />Brookfield Asset Management Inc.  took this strategy one step further last week, when it offered to buy the nearly 40% stake in  Brookfield Property Partners  LP it doesn’t already own for $5.9 billion.

Lyft officials shared their analysis of public data with the Biden team on the millions of at-risk people who lack health-care transportation benefits or have limited public transportation due to coronavirus, she said.<br />Separately, Uber said Tuesday it is joining with vaccine maker  Moderna Inc.  to provide users with vaccine-safety information via the ride-sharing app. The companies said they aim to work with public-health agencies to help those eligible for doses to schedule rides and receive reminder notifications.<br />The pandemic has weighed on ride-sharing companies as the spreading virus shut down restaurants and curbed social gatherings and travel. Ferrying people to vaccine sites could boost their business in the near term and may help kick-start a rollout that has gone more slowly than federal officials planned.<br />Both major ride-sharing companies have talked to public-health officials across the country about helping with appointment transport, according to people familiar with those discussions, and have publicly offered millions of free rides to and from vaccine-administration sites. Ms. Callahan said state and municipal officials from heavily populated areas have been asking Lyft for free rides “because they do not have the funds.”</td>

      <td>Oil is extending a steady recovery into 2021, aided by fresh signals that the world’s biggest producers won’t turn on the spigots and flood the market.<br />U.S. crude futures recently rose above $50 a barrel for the first time since last February, the latest milestone in a rebound powered by an uptick in travel and economic activity following the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Output cuts by large suppliers from Saudi Arabia to U.S. companies are turbocharging the advance, giving traders confidence that demand will exceed supply.<br />Prices have hit new peaks since Saudi Arabia said last week it would unilaterally cut output in February as part of an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia. The supply curbs instilled faith that the cartel will remain flexible with output even if the pandemic worsens and hurts demand.<br />U.S. shale producers are also indicating that they are in no rush to increase supply and instead plan to pay off debt and return cash to shareholders. Taken together, the commitments should help the energy industry’s recovery and highlight a recognition among producers that the economic toll caused by the pandemic is far from over, investors and industry executives say. That means there is no need for suppliers to spend on additional output.<br />“I don’t think the world really needs the oil at this point in time, so there’s not a big reason to grow,” said Richard Dealy, president and chief operating officer of Texas oil company Pioneer Natural Resources Co. Despite the recent rise in oil prices, Pioneer still plans to cap oil-production growth at zero to 5% in 2021.</td>

      <td>After last week’s special Senate elections in Georgia, Democrats are about to attain unified—though narrow—control of Washington. With that, the economy will likely be at the receiving end of significantly more federal support than most on Wall Street had expected.<br />It is a shift that could change the contours of the U.S. economy in the year ahead, accelerating the rebound that will likely come as more Americans are vaccinated against Covid-19 and allowing the Federal Reserve to begin lifting its foot off the accelerator sooner. It also could bring about higher taxes, more regulation and stepped-up deficit worries, but those concerns might not be front and center for some time.<br />One of Congress’s first orders of business following President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20 will likely be putting forward another relief package in response to the Covid-19 crisis. Before Georgia’s special elections, when many thought at least one Republican candidate would prevail, leaving the Senate under GOP control, economists and political analysts didn’t expect much in the way of additional aid. That has changed.<br />Now, another round of relief is widely expected, with the money likely going toward some combination of another round of household checks, an extension of enhanced unemployment benefits that are set to expire mid-March, small-business support and, perhaps, more state and local aid. Later there would be a push for spending aimed at infrastructure projects and clean-energy programs.<br />The scope for spending could be more limited than in the blue-wave scenarios Wall Streeters contemplated ahead of November’s election that foresaw Democrats gaining, rather than losing, seats in the House and capturing a bigger lead in the Senate. Moderate Democratic representatives and senators will hold more sway, and they will balk if they believe the price tag has become too high. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a centrist Democrat, already has indicated he would like additional household relief efforts to be targeted at people in need, as opposed to another round of payments that go to most Americans.</td>

The aircraft began flying again on Dec. 19, after clearing an inspection by the ministry’s Air Transportation Directorate General, it said.<br />Its first flight after the long hiatus didn’t carry passengers and was noncommercial, the ministry said. The plane began flying with passengers on Dec. 22, 2½ weeks before the crash. The aircraft’s certificate of airworthiness from the transport ministry is valid until Dec. 17, 2021, the ministry said.</td>

      <td>Mac sales boom in quarter that included in-house chip launch, according to IDC and Gartner</td>
      <td>As it turns out, Apple picked a perfect time to mess with the Mac.<br />The consumer-electronics giant launched a new line of the iconic computers with its first in-house processor in mid-November. The company felt strongly enough about the machines to remove the older models using Intel’s chips from its online store. It was no small gamble: Intel’s chips have powered Mac computers since 2006, while Apple’s new in-house processors use the entirely different Arm-based chip architecture that had so far proved unpopular in PC devices.<br />Buyers appeared to snap them up in what is an overall sweet spot for PC sales. According to sales data from market-research firms  Gartner  and IDC released Monday, Mac unit sales hit a record in the fourth quarter, which is also Apple’s fiscal first quarter. IDC estimates sales surged 49% year over year to about 7.3 million units, while Gartner estimates they jumped 31% to about 6.9 million units. Apple stopped disclosing unit sales of its devices at the end of its 2018 fiscal year; the most Mac sales it ever reported before that was 5.7 million units in the quarter ending in September 2015.<br />The pandemic made Apple’s timing especially fortuitous. Workers and students confined to their homes have been buying up PCs in droves across the board. Both IDC and Gartner reported another strong sales jump in the fourth quarter, with IDC estimating a 26% year-over-year increase to 91.6 million units. The three largest PC suppliers—Lenovo, HP and Dell—each saw double-digit gains in the period. Chromebooks have continued to play a strong role thanks to a boom in remote schooling; Gartner estimates Chromebook sales surged 200% year over year to about 11.7 million units in the quarter.<br />The boom from the pandemic is no doubt temporary for most of the mature PC market. Apple’s advantage here is that it still has Macs in its lineup awaiting the upgrade to its in-house processor. Those will include its desktop and pro-level machines, which are expected to be moved to Apple chips over the next year or two. That gives the Mac a good chance to outlive the current PC fever.</td>

      <td>LONDON— AstraZeneca  PLC has applied for emergency-use authorization in Europe of the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with the University of Oxford, a step toward the rollout of more shots across the region as infections and hospitalizations rise.<br />The European Union’s drug regulator said Tuesday it could authorize the vaccine as soon as Jan. 29 after completing a review of clinical-trial data. The European Medicines Agency’s key scientific committee will meet that day after additional analysis of the trial results and safety and manufacturing data. Any recommendation to green light the vaccine would likely be formalized by the European Commission within a day or two.<br />That timeline eventually could add 400 million doses to Europe’s vaccine arsenal as the region battles a deadly winter surge of the virus, exacerbated by the spread of a variant first discovered in the U.K. The EU has preordered 300 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, with an option for 100 million more.<br />Last week, Europe cleared a vaccine developed by  Moderna Inc.  for emergency use, giving the region a second Covid-19 shot. The bloc is struggling to distribute the doses it has, after authorizing a vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and German partner  BioNTech SE  in December.<br />Distribution across 27 member states has been hurt by logistical bottlenecks and challenges with ultracold storage requirements that complicate widespread distribution. Some governments in Europe early on were expecting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to be first to market, leaving them unprepared for the freezer logistics of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, resulting in slow, uneven rollouts.</td>

Samsung recently forecast a 25% jump in quarterly operating profit, aided by a resurgence in phone sales.<br />Not long ago, Huawei seemed on track to meet its oft-touted goal of permanently unseating Samsung. But in the three months ended Sept. 30, its global market share shrank by nearly a quarter from a year earlier to 15% while Samsung’s grew to 23%, according to market researcher Canalys Inc. Lower-cost Chinese operators like  Xiaomi Corp.  and Vivo Electronics Corp. also gained.<br />Those trends persisted during the final months of 2020, industry analysts say, with estimates for a slight retraction in shipments. The overall smartphone market has been struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic’s blows last spring and summer. Analysts say they expect consumer demand to return to pre-pandemic levels this year.</td>

      <td>Europe’s lockdown-support programs risk creating the kind of festering bad-debt problems that damaged its economy after the financial crisis</td>
      <td>A decade ago, Europe’s recovery from the global financial crisis was held back by the lingering bad-debt problems of its banks. History risks repeating itself.<br />The region’s generous lockdown-support programs and patchwork of insolvency laws could create so-called zombie firms—inefficient companies kept alive by cheap debt. Last month, the European Central Bank said this remains a risk.<br />Meanwhile, bank shares have been buoyed by optimism that Covid-19 vaccines will revive the economy and shareholder payouts will resume. The Stoxx Europe 600 banks index is up nearly 30% in the past three months, triple the main index performance and roughly on a par with the U.S. bank benchmark.<br />Following both the global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis, nonviable companies in Europe were kept alive by politicians worried about job losses and lenders hesitant to acknowledge bad debts. The zombies lowered markups, net investment and productivity in their markets as well as inflation in the wider economy, according to a recent report from the Federal Bank of New York—problems that have come back to bite their lenders too.<br />Pandemic support programs, such as loans and bankruptcy moratoria, aspire to give businesses the time needed to secure their finances and pivot operations to better serve pandemic and post-pandemic customers. Sometimes, though, the support simply provides cheap funds that help unsustainable companies limp on. It is very hard for policy makers to get the timing right on these programs: Rolling back too early could hurt viable businesses, but too late can create zombies.</td>

Postings rose from the end of November, when the number of available jobs were 11.8% below 2019’s trend, but the pace of improvement has eased since the summer, when businesses started to reopen after spring lockdowns. Indeed measures postings by comparing the recent rate of growth to that of a year earlier.<br />January is normally a strong month for job openings, but this year may be different, said Nick Bunker, economist at Indeed. Economists note employers offering in-person services, such as restaurants and hair salons, are facing renewed restrictions and weaker demand.<br />Further, some employers in higher-wage sectors like software development and finance are holding back on posting new jobs due to an uncertain outlook, Mr. Bunker said.<br />“They are still thinking about what’s going to happen in the medium term or long term for economic growth,” he said.</td>

      <td>A group of real-estate startups is aiming to cash in on the remote-work phenomenon.<br />With many corporate offices closed because of the pandemic, many young professionals have left cities like New York and San Francisco for warmer, cheaper places. A number still plan to return after their offices reopen, leaving them reluctant to buy homes or sign long-term apartment leases.<br />That situation is creating fresh demand for furnished housing on a short-term basis, a fast-growing niche that many property startups and their venture-capital backers are rushing to fill.<br />One of them is Landing, which runs a network of furnished apartments across the U.S. When it launched in 2019, the Birmingham, Ala., and San Francisco-based company initially planned to operate in about 30 cities last year. Instead, it expanded to 75, largely because demand grew much faster than expected, said Landing Chief Executive Bill Smith.<br />“Covid has taken a decade of change that I was thinking was going to happen between now and 2030 and kind of compressed it into a year,” he said.</td>

The congressional committee, which includes House and Senate leadership, convened a meeting on Monday to discuss efforts to bolster security.<br />A House Democratic aide familiar with the discussions said that, in response to last week’s deadly violence, construction efforts are now under way to erect “the largest perimeter ever established around the Capitol” for Mr. Biden’s inauguration. The new perimeter will add another layer to the secure areas typically in place for inaugural ceremonies at the Capitol.<br />Those talks came as federal officials decided to begin coordinating security steps sooner than they had planned and the National Guard announced it would bolster its presence in Washington ahead of the inauguration.</td>

The new borrowing drove the total amount of outstanding muni debt above $3.9 trillion for the first time since 2013, according to the Federal Reserve data from the third quarter.<br />The muni issuance boom is unlikely to abate as cash-strapped local governments struggle to make up for ongoing Covid-19-related shortfalls and pay back old debts. Before the pandemic, many city and state governments had already been operating on tight budgets.<br />Despite the increase in availability of muni bonds, investor demand remains strong. Central bank rate cuts have left investors clamoring for yield. Muni bond investments produced steady returns last year in a low-interest rate environment.<br />“There’s no yield anywhere so munis are still attractive on a relative basis,” said Jon Barasch, director of municipal evaluations at financial analytics company ICE Data Services.</td>

However, U.S. intelligence warned that Russia was engaged in trying to undermine Mr. Biden’s candidacy.<br />The Treasury said Monday that Mr. Derkach has been an active Russian agent for over a decade with close connections to the Kremlin’s intelligence services. Treasury officials added that since at least 2019 Mr. Derkach and his associates used U.S. media, social media, and “influential U.S. persons” to spread misleading and unsubstantiated allegations.<br />Monday’s action targeted senior Ukrainian parliamentarian Oleksandr Dubinsky and former Ukrainian officials Konstantin Kulyk, Oleksandr Onyshchenko and Andriy Telizhenko, all of whom the Treasury said coordinated with Mr. Derkach in his misinformation campaign.</td>

That was before a mob of the president’s supporters laid siege to the Capitol, leaving five people dead.<br />“Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honor represents and admiration for prior recipients,” Belichick said in a statement. “Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award.”<br />News of the offer to Belichick only emerged Sunday, prompting questions over whether the most accomplished coach in football history would stand by his friend amid the controversy.<br />Although Belichick’s statement did not mention Trump by name, the decision amounts to a sharp rebuke of a president who has faced calls from Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, to be removed from office. His decision comes just days after Trump awarded the medal to Gary Player and Annika Sorenstam, two of the best golfers of all time. Player and Sorenstam have faced criticism for associating with the president in the wake of recent events.</td>

The Department hasn’t had a leader confirmed by the Senate since Kirstjen Nielsen submitted her resignation in April 2019.<br />Mr. Wolf ultimately made the decision to leave, an aide said, because of an arcane law forbidding acting officials to continue to serve in their posts if the White House withdraws their Senate nomination.<br />Mr. Wolf was nominated to serve as Homeland Security secretary in August, but the White House withdrew his nomination last Wednesday in a move it hasn’t since explained.

      <td>He’d help the country and his Presidency by calling off the House.</td>
      <td>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is barreling ahead on a vote to impeach President Trump this week—days before a new President takes office, and with the outcome and timing of a Senate trial uncertain. This is a moment for Joe Biden to establish his leadership by calling off the House impeachers in service of his vow that this is a “time to heal.”<br />We explained Friday why Mr. Trump’s actions last Wednesday were impeachable offenses, and that the best outcome would be his resignation. It appears he won’t resign. But that doesn’t mean impeachment now is wise or good for the country if the goal is get past the Trump era. It may do more harm by letting Mr. Trump play the victim than good by stigmatizing behavior that most Americans already find unacceptable.<br />The first obstacle is timing. In eight days Mr. Trump will be gone from the White House. A House vote this week means no fact-finding or time for a presidential defense. The Senate isn’t scheduled to reconvene until Jan. 19, the day before Mr. Biden is inaugurated. Even if Senators convene earlier, Republicans aren’t likely to hold a trial without giving Mr. Trump a chance to mount a defense, as other impeached officials have been able to do.<br />That leaves a trial to take place when Mr. Trump is no longer President. Views differ on whether the Constitution allows impeachment after a President leaves office, though this would be a first. Alan Dershowitz, the law professor and one of Mr. Trump’s impeachment lawyers in 2019, made a compelling case Sunday that this constitutional point would be part of Mr. Trump’s defense.<br />This assumes Democrats even want a Senate trial and the risk of a potential acquittal. Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat, said Sunday the House might vote to impeach but then wait weeks or months before sending an article to the Senate.</td>

On Monday Mike Madigan, the speaker of the Illinois House for all but two years since 1983, said he will suspend his attempt to seek the 60 votes he needs for another term as the boss.<br />Mr. Madigan said he will wait and see if anyone else can get enough votes after he won only 51 in a Democratic caucus vote on Sunday. State Rep. Ann Williams finished second with 18 votes and another competitor had three. So Mr. Madigan still may keep the job in the end if he can threaten or buy off enough of the dissenters.<br />It’s amazing that he still received 51 votes. Mr. Madigan’s associates have been indicted in a corruption probe in which Commonwealth Edison agreed to pay a $200 million fine for a scheme to curry favor with the speaker. He says he did nothing wrong. He is also chair of the state Democratic Party, which he can use to make or break legislative careers.<br />Since he’s been speaker, the once great Prairie State has seen its credit rating fall from one of the highest to the worst in the country. Its citizens are fleeing for better-run neighbors and low-tax Florida. But even at 78 years old, he has managed to hold on to power like the Chicago ward boss he once was. Mr. Madigan’s political demise won’t save Illinois by itself, but it would be a start.</td>

      <td>The Justices can rein in an FTC that increasingly exceeds its authority.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration is expected to unleash regulators on business. So it’s good timing that the Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear a case (AMG Capital v. FTC) challenging the Federal Trade Commission’s abuse of its regulatory power.<br />Congress has empowered the FTC to prevent, prohibit and punish “unfair or deceptive” business practices. The Federal Trade Commission Act doesn’t define these terms, so the FTC is supposed to know them when it sees them. The agency increasingly sees them wherever it looks.<br />Consider the case of Scott Tucker, who managed companies that provided short-term loans over the internet that automatically renewed—a common feature of financial products. In 2002 the FTC began investigating Mr. Tucker. Ten years later, with no prior notice of legal violation, the FTC sued him and his businesses.<br />The agency says he engaged in unfair and deceptive practices by not disclosing loan terms with sufficient clarity. The FTC asked the district court to enjoin him and his associates from making these loans and fork over $27 million in restitution, which would go to the U.S. Treasury if “direct redress” to consumers was “impracticable.”<br />Mr. Tucker says this exceeded the FTC’s legal authority, and he has a strong case. In 1973 Congress stipulated that the FTC can seek injunctions for practices that are unfair or deceptive. Congress added in 1975 that the FTC can seek monetary relief, but only when a business has violated a cease-and-desist order or rule-making that expressly prohibits a practice. The FTC must also prove in court that a “reasonable man would have known under the circumstances” that the conduct at issue “was dishonest or fraudulent.”</td>

      <td>Xavier Becerra’s policy on nonprofits is in the dock.</td>
      <td>Xavier Becerra has been nominated to run the Department of Health and Human Services, but his current California office is going to the Supreme Court. The Justices agreed on Friday to hear a pair of lawsuits opposing California’s blanket policy that charities must turn over the names and addresses of their major donors.<br />That information is given to the IRS on a Schedule B form, but it’s sensitive and legally protected from federal disclosure. “No California law or regulation expressly requires charities to file their Schedule Bs with the California Attorney General in renewing their annual registrations,” says the petitioner in Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Becerra. The state began demanding the information in 2010.<br />California pledged to keep it confidential. But in the course of litigating this case, the foundation says that it “discovered 1,778 Schedule Bs that the Attorney General’s Registry had publicly posted online.” One disclosed was “a complete Schedule B for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California,” including “the names and addresses of hundreds of donors.” Whoops.<br />Mr. Becerra and state officials say Schedule Bs are required, and there’s a simple reason they weren’t demanded before 2010: “staffing shortages.” He adds that the donor information is used to detect and investigate fraud, as well as abuse of charitable status. But how is this narrowly tailored as a potential restriction on First Amendment rights?<br />The foundation says, “California lacks any satisfying explanation for why it is not content to send targeted, individualized requests for such information to the handful of charities it actually investigates.” Privacy is vital to freedom of association, as the Supreme Court recognized in 1958, when it held that the state of Alabama could not demand the NAACP’s membership lists.</td>

      <td>The FBI is warning in an internal memo of the possibility of armed protests at all 50 state capitols and in Washington, D.C., ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration, a law-enforcement official said.<br />The memo warns demonstrations may start later this week and continue through the inauguration, the official said, as federal agencies brace for the possibility of more violence following Wednesday’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol.<br />The National Park Service, citing the continuing danger from violent groups, said Monday it has closed facilities, parking areas and roadways in Washington, and is restricting access to the Washington Monument.<br />Ahead of last week’s attack, FBI agents had been concerned that specific people planning to attend the pro-Trump protest posed potential threats and discouraged some of them from traveling to Washington, but had no intelligence of a wider coordinated plot that would warrant a formal threat assessment, law-enforcement officials said Monday.<br />Officials believed that a formal intelligence bulletin—a document that alerts law enforcement to patterns or trends—wasn’t necessary in advance of what they expected to be a mostly peaceful political rally with some violent agitators.</td>

      <td>Pandemic drives sales as employees and students do their work remotely</td>
      <td>Personal computer sales last year registered their strongest growth in a decade, underscoring a shift to computers from mobile devices during the coronavirus pandemic, according to industry data.<br />“Demand is pushing the PC market forward and all signs indicate this surge still has a way to go,” Ryan Reith, program vice president with International Data Corp.’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, said in a statement.<br />IDC counted 302.6 million units sold globally last year, up 13% from the previous year. Research firm  Gartner  said PC shipments reached 275 million units in 2020, up 4.8% on the year. Similarly, Canalys pegged the increase at 11% to 297 million units, the highest annual growth since 2010 and the highest shipment volume since 2014.<br />Much of the difference in the tallies from the data providers comes from how each company defines PCs. Hardware makers in recent years have increasingly blurred the lines between personal computers and devices such as tablets.<br />The blockbuster figures come out just as CES, the world’s largest tech show, gets under way—virtually this year because of the pandemic. The annual gathering is often the staging ground for PC makers to unveil their latest models, which could help drive future sales.</td>
