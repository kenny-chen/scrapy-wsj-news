      <td>Caught in wave of opioid lawsuits, the drugmaker wants to leave shareholders behind in chapter 11</td>
      <td>Mallinckrodt  PLC shareholders are pressing for a seat at the bankruptcy bargaining table, where the future of the drugmaker will be determined.<br />Targeted in most of the opioid litigation that has driven other drugmakers to bankruptcy and hit with damages over pricing of a non-opioid product, Mallinckrodt filed for chapter 11 protection in October with a partial deal on a way out.<br />In broad strokes, the drugmaker wants to swap out debt for equity, and settle with the states, local governments, Native American tribes and others claiming damages for Mallinckrodt’s alleged wrongful marketing of painkillers.<br />Company shareholders, left behind under Mallinckrodt’s proposed bankruptcy scenario, are asking the court to appoint an official committee to speak for them in the chapter 11 negotiations.<br />Most companies that file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection sacrifice shareholders to pay creditors. Mallinckrodt, still profitable, could be an exception, shareholders said in court papers. Stephen Welch, chief transformation officer for Mallinckrodt, said the debt-for-equity swap proposal was the best the company could do as it is confronted with billions of dollars in potential damages.</td>

      <td>The Federal Reserve said Tuesday it had formally joined an international effort of central banks and financial regulators aimed at mitigating climate change risks.<br />The Fed said it is now formally a member of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System. Joining concludes the Fed’s status as a lone hold out from an effort that counts the European Central Bank, the  Bank of Japan ,  the Bank of Canada and many others as members.<br />The formal membership wasn’t unexpected. The Fed’s point man for financial regulation, Randal Quarles, noted recently that the U.S. central bank had sought to join after it had already been engaging with the group on an informal basis.<br />In a statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said “as we develop our understanding of how best to assess the impact of climate change on the financial system, we look forward to continuing and deepening our discussions with our NGFS colleagues from around the world.”<br />The network, which launched three years ago, is a forum for central bankers and regulators to come together and discuss how their institutions can ensure their financial systems don’t worsen climate change risks, and how financial institutions might be able to lower those risks.</td>

He doesn’t have prior experience as a prosecutor.<br />He will take over the top job at the Justice Department upon Mr. Barr’s departure on Dec. 23. Mr. Barr resigned on Monday. Other Justice Department officials said they didn’t expect Mr. Rosen to deviate from Mr. Barr’s policies. However, they noted he had been involved in sensitive litigation that the White House had an interest in, including a lawsuit against Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, over the publication of his book in June.<br />Mr. Rosen has spent most of his career in the private sector and at several other government agencies. They include the Transportation Department where he served in the No. 2 job before joining the Justice Department as deputy attorney general.<br />In October, Mr. Rosen, 62 years old, unveiled the Justice Department’s case against Google, alleging that the search giant is illegally preserving its monopoly status by engaging in anticompetitive tactics that shut out future innovators from challenging its dominance. “I think we do go through these tech phases,” Mr. Rosen said in an interview at the time, adding: “I think it’s not uncommon that they raise some antitrust issues.”</td>

Those blank-check companies raise capital by going public and can put the proceeds into deals.<br />Group Nine Media is interested in acquisitions that could grow its audience and give it more bargaining power with online advertisers.<br />The venture-backed company, which formed in 2016 through the merger of several digital-media businesses, has already begun buying competitors. Last year, it purchased PopSugar, a women-focused digital publisher, adding its site and web properties to a portfolio that includes animal-focused The Dodo and NowThis, a news publisher.<br />It isn’t clear which company or companies Group Nine Media would target for acquisitions. Group Nine’s all-stock deal with PopSugar valued Group Nine at $600 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.</td>

      <td>The Attorney General was the right man for the job in hyper-partisan times.</td>
      <td>William Barr resigned as Attorney General on Monday, effective Dec. 23, and he’s certainly earned the right to leave early. He has been the right man at the right time for that difficult job, with the principles and toughness to make difficult decisions despite bitter Democrats in Congress and a willful President Trump.<br />Mr. Barr had already been AG once so he didn’t need the title. He took the job in a Washington marked by no-limits partisanship knowing that he would be criticized no matter what he did. But he wanted to clean up a Justice Department that he rightly knew had been tainted by a corrupt FBI under James Comey and political appointees in both parties who lacked the courage or tenacity to take responsibility for hard prosecutorial judgments.<br />His achievements included navigating the end of the Robert Mueller probe while protecting the office of the Presidency from unconstitutional conclusions about obstruction of justice. Future Presidents of both parties will thank him.<br />He was willing to endure media and Democratic smears by taking fresh looks at old investigations. This included hiring U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine how the FBI could decide to investigate the 2016 Trump campaign as a Russian front. His release of documents has helped to show the FBI probe began in partisan scheming and unlawful practices, and Mr. Durham is staying on the job and may have more to report and indictments.<br />Mr. Barr also had the guts to ask another U.S. Attorney, Jeffrey Jensen, to re-examine Mr. Mueller’s prosecution of Michael Flynn. That probe turned up more malpractice and a decision to dismiss charges that never should have been brought. Mr. Barr used the lessons of these misguided probes to impose new rules and limits on political investigations.</td>

      <td>Holding the next AG accountable for how the case is handled.</td>
      <td>Even as Attorney General William Barr prepares to leave office after resigning on Monday (see nearby), effective Dec. 23, Republicans and many on the right are demanding that he appoint a special counsel to investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. The better idea is to make the next AG responsible for how that case is handled.<br />Hunter acknowledged last week that his “tax affairs” are under investigation by federal prosecutors, who are also looking into his influence-peddling via deals with Chinese interests and a Ukrainian gas company. Most of the media ignored the story before the election, and we warned this could create troubles for a President Biden. And here we are.<br />One problem among many with special counsels is that they are often politically unaccountable, wandering into areas far beyond their remit. Robert Mueller’s team never did find proof of Russia-Trump collusion. But they did torment Michael Flynn on an unrelated charge that was unjustly brought. A special counsel can also bury a case in secret for years, and an AG can duck questions by saying that’s the special counsel’s job.<br />The U.S. Attorney for Delaware is reported to have opened a Hunter investigation in 2018, and there is good reason to believe it can complete its work—barring political interference. This would be the preferred outcome, since Democrats would have a harder time claiming any future charges brought by career prosecutors were politically motivated. Meantime, any effort by a Biden Justice Department to transfer staff, dictate outcomes, or shut down the probe would leak and have political costs.<br />A Republican Senate would also be watching if the GOP secures at least one Georgia runoff seat on Jan. 5. The country was alerted to Hunter’s potential legal jeopardy by Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley, who in September issued a detailed report about Hunter’s deals in Ukraine, Russia, China and Kazakhstan. The Senators continue to investigate and they’d have subpoena power.</td>

      <td>Democrats accuse President Trump of politicizing the Federal Reserve, and sometimes not without cause. But look who’s now demanding that the central bank and other financial regulators accommodate their plans to politically allocate capital.<br />The Senate Democrats’ Special Committee on the Climate Crisis recently issued a report detailing how the Fed and eight other regulatory agencies should penalize investment in fossil fuels and promote green energy. They claim financial institutions are underpricing the risk that carbon-intensive assets will become “stranded.”<br />Mind you, their worry isn’t about how climate change per se would devalue investments, which financial institutions already account for. They want a warning about the costs of government climate policies. “Because Congress has not advanced any comprehensive climate policies in the last decade, the market has not priced in the possibility of significant federal action,” the report notes.<br />“This process—or more accurately, the mere realization that this process is imminent—will drive down the value of assets tied to the carbon-sensitive energy, electric power, and transportation sectors, among others,” Democrats warn. “The risk of holding this type of asset, which will lose value in a low-carbon economy, is referred to as transition risk.” In other words, Democrats want to kill your business, so please account for the hospitalization and burial costs.<br />For starters, Democrats want the Fed to use capital and liquidity standards and annual stress tests to make banks—and potentially also insurers and asset managers—price in these unknowable political risks. They want regulators to assign carbon-intensive assets higher risk weights, so banks would have to hold more capital against them. This would discourage banks from financing such investments, while “green” investments would be deemed lower risk.</td>

Mr. Biden is balancing several factors, including diversity, gender and geography, the people said, along with expertise in areas like environmental justice, which calls for laws and regulations to treat historically disadvantaged groups fairly. Much of the decision-making is connected, with choices for some posts influencing who gets chosen for others.<br />Rep. Deb Haaland (D., N.M.) is a leading contender for Interior secretary, according to people familiar with the matter. If confirmed, she would be the first Native American cabinet secretary. Activists and progressives are pushing for a Native American to run the agency, which oversees federal lands and the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Ms. Haaland’s stock has risen among some of Mr. Biden’s advisers in recent days. But some Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about losing another lawmaker to the administration because of their slim majority in the House.<br />Ms. Haaland and Biden teams are in discussions, but no offer has been made, according to a person familiar with the matter. Retiring Sen. Tom Udall (D., N.M.), whose father served as Interior secretary, is also among the potential candidates, as is former Deputy Interior Secretary Michael Connor, who also has Native American heritage.</td>

      <td>Another diplomatic normalization shows Israel’s greater clout.</td>
      <td>Israel’s era of diplomatic good feeling presses on, with the Jewish state winning recognition last week from Morocco in North Africa and over the weekend from Bhutan in South Asia. The majority-Buddhist Himalayan kingdom of less than a million people may not be a strategic powerhouse, but its normalization shows that Israel’s new diplomatic standing extends beyond the Persian Gulf.<br />Unlike the Abraham Accords involving the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, the U.S. didn’t broker the deal between Israel and Bhutan. The agreement was signed in India. Yet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that Bhutan’s recognition was “additional fruit of the peace agreements.”<br />It’s also fruit of Israel’s economic and strategic clout in South Asia. India’s trade with Israel—including military equipment—has been steadily increasing as its economy grows, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Netanyahu have warm relations. Bhutan is a close Indian partner and China has stepped up disputes along the kingdom’s borders.<br />One payoff for the U.S. of the Abraham Accords was the promise that they could lead to increased investment in Israeli technology from wealthy Arab states, displacing Chinese capital. If the Bhutan-Israel agreement further strengthens Israel-India ties, that also redounds to the benefit of the U.S. as it tries to balance China’s influence in Eurasia.<br />As Joe Biden begins Middle East diplomacy, he will be engaging with an Israel that is in a stronger strategic position than when he was last in the White House. He says he wants to build on the Trump Administration’s diplomatic progress between Israel and the Arab world, and a November Journal report suggests Saudi Arabia is holding out on recognizing Israel in the hope of using it to improve its standing with the Biden Administration.</td>

But with supply tight in first shipments, hospitals across the U.S. have been forced to decide who goes first, with plans in flux up to the final days.<br />The Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use—the first to get such a green light—late Friday, setting in motion UPMC’s push to notify individual employees who will get the opportunity to receive the earliest shots. By Monday, the first UPMC health-care workers finally had an answer to who would be offered the vaccine.</td>

It would also further the goals of progressive politicians who seek to punish charitable giving they don’t like and can’t control.<br />The “Initiative to Accelerate Charitable Giving” is framed as a way to force the wealthy to give more. It enjoys the backing of some of America’s biggest and most prominent foundations, including Ford, Kresge, Kellogg and Hewlett. These large and powerful institutions are effectively trying to dictate how smaller and less influential donors give, which dovetails neatly with the goals of progressive politicians and activists.<br />The centerpiece is a series of regulations on donor-advised funds, a popular option for philanthropists outside the 1%. While the foundations supporting the initiative control a combined $38 billion, the average donor-advised fund has a little more than $166,000 set aside for charity. Donor-advised funds allow individuals to donate as much as they like annually, even a few hundred dollars. Some choose to give right away, while others take a long-term approach, waiting to align their priorities with the needs of the communities they aim to serve. These funds also provide donors with the option of privacy—the particular focus of political attack.<br />Donor-advised funds have multiplied. The number of accounts has risen by more than 300% since 2010, and as their popularity has grown, so has the criticism. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse routinely savages them, since he can’t see and therefore attack or control who gives to them. Yet the vast majority of givers are supporting critical services helping people in need, and liberals use donor-advised funds to support their favored causes too.<br />The Arnold-Madoff initiative would starve them of funding. Most notably, it encourages Congress to pass legislation that would force donor-advised funds to disburse money within 15 years or lose tax deductibility, pushing more money into the hands of tax collectors instead of charities. The 15-year marker is entirely arbitrary, and discriminatory: The foundations that back the proposal would still be able to hold their tax-advantaged funds in perpetuity. Yet donor-advised funds already have a higher payout rate than the required minimum payout for a foundation—approximately 20% compared with 5%—even though they have only a tenth of the $1 trillion managed by foundations. Donor-advised funds and private foundations alike should have the option to address the needs of communities over a longer time horizon.</td>

      <td>Even as Covid-19 cases surge world-wide, the arrival of viable vaccines holds the promise of a return to something resembling normality by the middle of next year. But the commercial real-estate sector may never get back to normal, and that could spell trouble for banks.<br />Many banks are concentrated in and dependent on commercial property lending. Banks hold half of all commercial real-estate loans. The 5,000 or so U.S. community banks, with about a third of total assets, are two to three times as concentrated in commercial real-estate lending as the approximately 30 larger banks.<br />Problems in commercial real estate can hurt banks in two ways. Losses on existing loans can damage earnings directly, and a correction can reduce future lending volumes, impairing an important driver of earnings. Based on what we know now, things don’t look good.<br />Neiman Marcus and at least 28 other major retailers have filed for bankruptcy. Hotel occupancy is down 32%. The Journal reported last month that world-wide airline capacity in October was down 58% from 2019. Apartment rent levels have collapsed 15% to 25% in large cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston and Seattle. Suburban shopping malls have been devastated.<br />A recent  Citigroup  report on 400 properties in the retail and hotel sectors found an average decline in value of 27%. The stock prices of real-estate investment trusts, companies that own equity in commercial properties, are down 42% for retail properties since the most recent valuation prior to the pandemic onset in March. Office-property REITs are down 36% and lodging property REITs are down 50%—all despite the recent stock-market rally on vaccine news.</td>

      <td>How a Joe Biden Justice Department could investigate Biden’s son.</td>
      <td>Will Hunter Biden wake up to a special counsel in his Christmas stocking?<br />News reports say President Trump wants his attorney general to name one. The law says a special counsel is warranted in a criminal investigation when leaving it to the Justice Department presents “a conflict of interest.” It’s hard to imagine a more unambiguous conflict of interest than the one Hunter Biden presents: A Joe Biden Justice Department investigating his son over conduct that might also implicate the sitting president.<br />Even so, a special counsel is a bad idea.<br />Two weeks ago, Mr. Barr announced that in October he’d appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham as special counsel for the investigation into the origins of the FBI’s Russia-collusion probe. He did so to ensure Mr. Durham could finish his investigation regardless of the election outcome.<br />The argument was that the magnitude and nature of the allegation—that those at the uppermost levels of the government abused their power to intervene in a U.S. election and then to undermine a duly elected president—made appointing a special counsel the lesser of evils. It’s a strong argument, and it has persuaded many who otherwise rightly regard the institution of special counsel as pernicious.</td>

      <td>Want better instructors at universities and colleges? Then emphasize teaching, not research, when recruiting faculty members.</td>
      <td>As the pandemic has forced most colleges and universities to adopt remote instruction, it’s worth remembering that more than 50 years ago some schools voluntarily experimented with remote instruction via televised classes. That did not go well either. Students did not feel the same connection to their instructors and that, in turn, made a difference in what was learned. “It’s better to have a poor instructor in the classroom,” said one unhappy professor in 1967, “than to have a good one on TV.”<br />The vignette comes from Jonathan Zimmerman’s “The Amateur Hour: A History of College Teaching in America.” Mr. Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania, has braided together a smooth narrative from many short pieces of thread, consisting of glimpses into the experiences of faculty members, students and administrators from the early 19th century up through the 1990s, and encompassing two- and four-year institutions, large and small, elite and not. The book is economical in its presentation of materials, gathered from 60-plus archives, and even-handed in presenting the gripes of instructors and students.<br />The book’s clever title refers to the way that higher education, when hiring, evaluating and rewarding faculty, gives most attention to research productivity and little to teaching effectiveness. Partly this is due to the difficulty of measuring effectiveness in the classroom, but it is also due to the resistance of faculty members to having their teaching reviewed by peers—something that would, Mr. Zimmerman says, “make their teaching truly professional.”<br />“The Amateur Hour” begins with the recitation model of college teaching, which was near universal in the early 1800s. Students were asked to read an assigned passage and then, at class time, recite either a summary or, some professors might insist, the passage in its entirety. When lectures began to displace recitation, some college presidents worried aloud about the problem of keeping students actively engaged throughout the class session. The Yale Report of 1828 wondered whether the student attending a lecture “may repose upon his seat and yield a passive hearing . . . without ever calling into exercise the powers of his own mind.”<br />As more students enrolled in higher education, hiring did not keep pace. Class sizes grew, and students had less contact with professors. Previously, faculty members at small liberal-arts colleges knew every student on campus and could demonstrate personal concern for them. By the late 19th century, however, many American faculty members were trained in Germany and brought back with them a passion for research, as well as more interest in libraries and laboratories than in students. In 1887, Julius Seelye, the president of Amherst College, lamented the changes: “Education is a wholly personal work. It is not gained by books, or by instruction alone, nor by anything in place of the living inspiration of the living teacher.”</td>

Last week, while listening to NPR, we heard this: “President Trump continues to lie, saying he won the election, and that fraud was rampant . . .”<br />President Trump certainly wouldn’t be the first president to lie to the American people. And he probably won’t be the last. But he probably is the first American president to be called a liar by so many large mainstream news organizations in their news accounts.<br />Not just National Public Radio, either. The  New York Times  uses the word “lie” and “liar” referring to Trump in its headlines. When the newspaper of record does this, it is cheered by all those who despise Donald Trump. And the divide among Americans gets even deeper.</td>

      <td>Shared interests help shape geopolitical rivalries, but they can’t erase them.</td>
      <td>Critics are already attacking the incoming Biden administration, raking it  for sending mixed signals on China. The Biden Team is playing a sort of good cop, bad cop with Beijing—Jake Sullivan urges Americans to support Australia against Chinese pressure as John Kerry muses about grand climate deals with Beijing. But a mixed-signal strategy at this stage is, if anything, beneficial to Team Biden. It’s the new administration’s potential for later fuzzy thinking when it comes to great power rivals such as China that should worry onlookers.<br />Sending mixed signals is a standard diplomatic technique. Iran has been using a good cop, bad cop strategy against the U.S. for decades, and it has paid off pretty well. There’s no reason an American president shouldn’t give it a try.<br />True, Beijing doesn’t appear to be seeking relationship resets: China is behaving aggressively toward India, Australia and others. Confrontational Chinese “wolf warrior diplomats” continue to be prominent. Still, the Trump years have been a wild ride, and giving Beijing a chance to decide whether it wants to deal with the good or bad cops in the Biden administration will at least clarify U.S. choices.<br />But while a good cop, bad cop routine in December 2020 won’t derail the new team, failing to deal effectively with the challenge a rising China poses to America and its Indo-Pacific allies could.<br />Though there is much to criticize about the Trump administration, its members understood that without geopolitical success it doesn’t really matter what Americans think about climate change, human rights or the politics of gender. If the U.S. had lost World War II, Franklin Roosevelt’s ideas about human rights and multilateral institutions would be historical curiosities.</td>
