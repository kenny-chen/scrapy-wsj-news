      <td>The boss of the company at the heart of a widespread hack that has affected hundreds of businesses said he briefed the White House and that attackers are demanding a single $70 million ransomware payment.<br />The cyberattack that started to unfold Friday is estimated to have hit hundreds of mostly small and medium-size businesses and tens of thousands of computers. It quickly set off alarms in U.S. national security circles over concern that it could have far-reaching effects.<br />On Monday, Fred Voccola, the chief executive of Kaseya Ltd., whose software was targeted in the attack, spoke with Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger about the event while the company was still scrambling to restore services to its customers, Mr. Voccola said. Mr. Voccola told the White House that Kaseya wasn’t aware of any critical infrastructure that had been hit by the ransomware or of any victims related to national security, he said in an interview Monday.<br />A White House spokeswoman didn’t immediately comment.<br />The hackers behind the ransomware attack said that, upon payment, they will release a “universal decryptor” that would unlock computers that had been encrypted and rendered unusable by the attack, according to a note posted to the group’s website Sunday. Mr. Voccola declined to discuss the payment issue.</td>

He faces a sentence of as long as 30 years in prison.<br />Ms. Cáceres was killed by two gunmen who broke into her house in the small town of La Esperanza in the middle of the night and shot her six times. In 2015, Ms. Cáceres had won the Goldman Environmental Prize, considered to be the world’s highest honor for grass-roots environmental activists.<br />At the time of her murder, Ms. Cáceres had been receiving government protection at the request of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the human-rights unit of the Organization of American States.</td>

      <td>OPEC failed in its third attempt to resolve a deadlock over oil production after divisions between allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates spilled into public and into global financial markets.<br />The group called off a meeting scheduled for Monday with Russia-led oil producers after the U.A. E.—typically one of Riyadh’s most dependable supporters in the group—refused to agree to a Saudi-backed deal to boost output, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, tentatively approved by the rest of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the Russia-led group, together known as OPEC+, calls for unleashing millions of barrels a day of bottled-up crude to help tame steadily rising oil prices.<br />Oil prices rose to fresh multiyear highs after the OPEC meeting was called off as investors weighed whether the spat could endanger a near-term deal for more barrels. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1% to $76.96 a barrel, the highest level since late 2018.<br />The U.A.E. says it is asking for scope to produce more of its oil under any accord. Its unwillingness to compromise comes as Riyadh and Abu Dhabi—neighbors, military partners and traditional OPEC allies—diverge on several fronts, economic and geopolitical.<br />The U.A.E. has invested heavily in its own output—an effort aimed at pumping more oil, faster, to finance a transition to a more diverse economy. “The U.A.E.’s energy strategy has evolved to take into account energy transition, the speed at which it wants to develop its resources,” said Roger Diwan, an oil-focused vice president at energy consultancy  IHS Markit .</td>

      <td>The president calls the extra $80 billion for the agency an ‘investment.’</td>
      <td>Joe Biden may be mistaken about many things, but he’s right about the Internal Revenue Service. If the IRS is to become the agency he wants it to become, it needs the $80 billion in extra funding he is now proposing.<br />It comes down to the tax gap. This is the difference between what people owe the IRS and what it actually manages to collect. Though Commissioner Charles Rettig told the Senate Finance Committee in April that the IRS is leaving $1 trillion on the table each year, a more recent Treasury Department analysis put the gap at roughly $600 billion for 2019, which it said “is on pace to total $7 trillion over the course of the next decade.”<br />There are two schools of thought here. The first—call it the Joe Biden School—holds that the answer is to give the IRS the authority, funding and manpower it needs to go out and bring in that missing revenue. Accordingly, an $80 billion IRS infusion will more than pay for itself by generating an additional $700 billion in tax revenue over the next decade. It’s a bargain at the price.<br />The other school—let’s call it the Milton Friedman School—holds that the best tax collection system comes from a tax code that keeps taxes low, fair and simple. In either case, the kind of IRS you believe you need is more or less dictated by the tax code you prefer.<br />For Mr. Biden, the political appeal of a bigger and more aggressive IRS is obvious. It enables him to reassure ordinary Americans that none of the burden for all the trillions in new spending he wants will fall on them. Instead, it will all be borne by tax cheats and fat cats who aren’t paying their fair share.</td>

      <td>Actions against RCA, AT&T and Xerox gave a leg up to European and Japanese firms.</td>
      <td>When it comes to technology and the economy, the U.S. is grappling with two contradictory goals: competing with China in advanced technology industries and ramping up antitrust enforcement against leading U.S. tech companies.<br />Antimonopoly advocates argue that we can have our cake and eat it too. Go ahead and break up big tech, they say; we can still compete with China. But there is a long history of U.S. antitrust actions against technology companies, and the results suggest regulators should exercise caution.<br />Consider the case of Western Electric,  AT&T ’s  equipment subsidiary. By the early 1920s, it had factories in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and the U.K. But because AT&T relied on it exclusively for equipment, in 1925 the Justice Department threatened AT&T with breakup unless it divested Western Electric’s foreign assets, creating International Telephone & Telegraph and ultimately giving birth to robust foreign-owned competitors.<br />Antitrust regulators also pressured AT&T’s Bell Labs in the early 1950s to license its newly invented transistor technology. That spurred innovation because it helped emerging companies such as  Texas Instruments  and Fairchild. But because of government pressure, AT&T also licensed its technology, almost for free, to foreign companies. This eventually enabled  Sony  to take global leadership from the U.S. in consumer electronics, and it gave a major leg up to Europe’s Ericsson and  Siemens .<br />The U.S. also used to be the global leader in television technology thanks to the Radio Corp. of America, the pathbreaker in color television. But in the 1950s the Justice Department required RCA to let other U.S. companies use its patents at no charge. RCA had long relied on licensing revenue, so it started making money where it could—in Japan. “RCA licenses made Japanese color television possible,” technology historian James Abegglen has written.</td>

      <td>What the fall of empires, the rise of nations and the spread of diasporas have meant for Sunni Islam and Roman Catholicism.</td>
      <td>In July 1900, after a wave of attacks against civilians and politicians in Europe and America, an Italian anarchist who had been living in Paterson, N.J., murdered the king of Italy. In November 2015, Muslims from Molenbeek, Belgium (and elsewhere), killed 130 innocent people in Paris. In both cities, immigrant revolutionaries had pursued their global political agendas against the governments of their old and new homes alike. Faced with poverty, police surveillance and disproportionately high incarceration rates, some in these communities saw militancy as a legitimate form of politics and undertook several spectacular acts of international violence to advance their cause.<br />Pushing past an initial sense of cognitive dissonance, is it possible to think about these two bloody moments together? Today we have jarringly different perceptions of these two communities, but might we be willing to contemplate a fate for European Muslims similar to what has come to pass for American Catholics, one in which they have assimilated and also changed the civic and cultural life of their adopted countries? Joe Biden is the second Catholic president. Is it a bridge too far to contemplate a Muslim head of state in Belgium or France?<br />These are some of the knotty questions suggested by Jonathan Laurence, a professor of political science at Boston College, in his book “Coping With Defeat: Sunni Islam, Roman Catholicism, and the Modern State.” Mr. Laurence aims to shake us out of more somnolent ways of thinking about history and its place in current geopolitics. He succeeds in large measure due to his commitment to “systematic paired comparison,” which helps suspend lazy assumptions about the supposed inherent, eternal differences between Christianity and Islam.<br />Instead his refreshing, provocative work explores how the two largest religious planets in the political solar system adjusted to the birth of an entirely new celestial body—the state. Mr. Laurence argues that the displacement of religion by self-described secular states led to changes within the dominant religions—namely, the professionalization and institutionalization of Roman Catholicism and Sunni Islam. Political defeat produced new forms of spiritual authority—articulated and extended through the mechanisms of infrastructure, education and hierarchy—that the author terms “nation-state Islam” and “nation-state Catholicism.”<br />The story unfolds in three acts: the fall of empires, the rise of nations and the spread of diasporas. In each moment, Mr. Laurence offers a deeply researched analysis of how both religions counterpunched and adapted to their losses. Against its forfeitures of territory after Luther’s religious revolution and the political upheavals that followed, Catholicism’s Counter-Reformation expanded the number of dioceses around the globe, established Rome’s system of colleges, and created the Propaganda Fide, dedicated to evangelization. Nation-states took even more land and power from the church, eventually circumscribing direct papal sovereignty to the minuscule parcel of Vatican City. In the final period, Catholicism’s power manifested as almost exclusively spiritual and moral.</td>

      <td>With their ‘pretense of knowledge,’ BlackRock and Facebook make it harder to find the truth.</td>
      <td>The suppression of debate over the origin of the novel coronavirus highlights a broader problem. Governments were once the chief impediments to free speech and free markets, but extremely large private companies may have become the greater danger. These hyperscale firms serve as hubs and gateways in the highly networked knowledge economy. They are well-positioned to exert special control over information—and other companies.<br />China’s stalling and lying about Covid’s origins weren’t surprising. On the other hand, the behavior of U.S. officials and scientists was startling. They dissembled over their intimate knowledge of gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and their early suspicions the virus was “engineered.” But who expects politicians and bureaucrats to be honest and competent? That’s what an open society is for. Truth and accountability are the responsibility of a free press—and a free internet.<br />What happens when the press and the internet aren’t so free? Over the past year, YouTube,  Twitter  and  Facebook  joined with a partisan press to block and throttle discussion across a range of Covid-19 topics. They discouraged and erased talk of the Wuhan lab-leak hypothesis, cheap and safe generic treatments such as ivermectin, Sweden’s heterodox decision to stay mostly open, and the inefficacy (and cruelty) of school closures.<br />Social media even blocked access to three eminent epidemiologists—professors at Stanford, Harvard and Oxford Universities—who advocated “focused protection” of the vulnerable, which could have avoided the devastating economic and social costs of the overly broad lockdowns. A new National Bureau of Economic Research paper suggests lockdowns were a net negative for public health. In too many cases, independent-minded scientists and data analysts were right, while Big Public Health and Big Tech were wrong.<br />In his 1974 Nobel Prize lecture, Friedrich Hayek explained why this top-down “pretense of knowledge” is so dangerous. At the time Hayek was fighting socialists and Keynesians. The socialists thought governments should own and operate most industries and could allocate resources more efficiently and fairly than private firms. The Keynesians allowed more private control of business but thought they could fine-tune the economy with aggressive fiscal, monetary and regulatory policy.</td>

      <td>The data suggest prices will continue to increase, but the bank is guilty of faulty analysis.</td>
      <td>Economists routinely make mistakes in forecasting, and such mistakes are often forgiven. But recent errors by the Federal Reserve are deeper analytical blunders. As with any activity that claims to have professional status, economics must respect elementary arithmetic.<br />From May 2020 to May 2021 the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, or PCE, rose 3.9%, while the consumer-price index jumped 5%. The inflation outbreak has come as a shock to many economists. The latest numbers have undoubtedly required top officials and researchers at the Federal Reserve to revise their thinking.<br />The Fed considers the PCE index the most reliable indicator of price trends. The Federal Open Market Committee predicted in June 2020 that the increase in the PCE in the year to fourth quarter 2021 would be between 1.4% and 1.7%. At its June 2021 meeting the band was increased to between 3.1% and 3.5%, still too low. The 200-basis-point adjustment is the largest since the instability of the Great Recession more than a decade ago.<br />Now the Fed is saying that consumer inflation will be less than 3.5% by the end of the year, even as the underlying data tell a different story. Between the fourth quarter of 2020 (taking the average of three months) and May 2021, the PCE index increased 2.5%. In other words, the bulk of the 3.9% price increase has happened in 2021. So far in 2021 the typical monthly increase has been between 0.4% and 0.5%. If that trend continues unabated, the end-year numbers would be on the order of 5% or 6%.<br />The FOMC might still be right, but it’s clearly assuming that upward pressure on prices will weaken. Have such pressures been weakening or intensifying so far in 2021? What is the reality facing American business and finance? One way to assess the evidence is to check the results of business surveys. Among the most widely cited and well-regarded is the purchasing managers index from the Institute of Supply Management.</td>

      <td>LONDON—U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England was on track to lift almost all Covid-19 restrictions as planned on July 19, even as the highly transmissible Delta variant of coronavirus drives a new surge in infections.<br />The move puts the U.K. in the vanguard of countries betting that vaccines will provide a durable route back to normalcy, despite the circulation of dangerous new variants. Mr. Johnson said the U.K.’s experience of Delta shows the shots have weakened, though not eliminated, the link between rising caseloads, swelling hospital numbers and spiraling deaths that characterized earlier stages of the pandemic.<br />He pitched the lifting of restrictions this month, already delayed once, as an end to government intervention and a revival of personal responsibility. Laws on social distancing, mask-wearing and other common features of the Covid-19 era are expected to be scrapped, he said, with the onus instead on individuals to make their own decisions about the appropriate steps to take to stay safe and protect others.<br />“This pandemic is far from over,” Mr. Johnson said at a news conference Monday, adding that the U.K. must reconcile itself to more Covid-19 deaths. But vaccines have changed the balance of risks between the burden of disease and the cost to the economy and society of continuing restrictions, he said.<br />“We must be honest with ourselves that if we can’t reopen our society in the next few weeks, when we will be helped by the arrival of summer and by the school holidays, then we must ask ourselves when will we be able to return to normal?”</td>

The Energy Ministry granted Pemex control of the development after the companies failed to reach an agreement.<br />Talos also questioned the assessment by a third-party firm that Pemex has just over half the likely reserves. The Zama oilfield, located in the southern Gulf of Mexico, straddles an area that includes a block won by the Talos-led consortium in a 2015 bidding round, and a block that Pemex was awarded in 2014 before the government began putting exploration blocks out to bid.<br />Mr. López Obrador, who opposed the opening to private investment made under his predecessor, put a freeze on new oil block auctions when he took office in late 2018. His administration has also pushed through Congress changes in hydrocarbon and electricity laws that seek to favor the state-energy companies, although they have been blocked by the courts.</td>

      <td>The new Chair snatches unilateral authority and rescinds bipartisan Obama-era standards.</td>
      <td>Independent federal agencies have power over American life that the Founders never imagined, and that reign is about to expand with a vengeance in the Biden era. Witness the unprecedented power grab engineered last week at the Federal Trade Commission by the new chair, Lina Khan.<br />The events didn’t get much attention because the press cares more about politics than governance. But on a series of 3-2 votes, the Democratic commissioners turned agency tradition upside down and gave themselves vast new powers to harass business.<br />The agency eliminated the long-standing role of the agency’s chief administrative law judge in presiding over fact-finding and rule-making. Now Ms. Khan, or someone of her choosing, will preside. The Democrats also killed the requirement that the FTC staff get a majority vote of the commission to start an investigation. Now only a single commissioner can sign off. Subpoenas can also fly at Ms. Khan’s discretion.<br />The commissioners rescinded the bipartisan Obama-era FTC statement, adopted in 2015, that the agency follow antitrust law as it has evolved in the courts. This is a sure signal that the three Democrats are planning to dump the consumer-welfare standard for antitrust that has prevailed for decades. Instead the agency will replace it with some new standard it hasn’t specified. Also on the chopping block is the “rule of reason” the Supreme Court has applied to antitrust law for more than a century.<br />This is the handiwork of Ms. Khan and Rohit Chopra, who is still a commissioner but has been nominated by Mr. Biden to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Ms. Khan is a 32-year-old academic who has no experience running anything. She helped write the October 2020 House Antitrust Subcommittee report on Big Tech and has called for breaking up large firms. Now she’s teeing up the FTC to stretch its powers in a way it hasn’t done since the 1970s and 1980s before it was rebuked by Congress and the courts.</td>

The Justice Department last month rushed out a lawsuit claiming that Georgia’s new election law violates Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act only days before the Supreme Court laid down standards that make the lawsuit a nearly certain loser.<br />Justice knew the likely timing of the Court’s ruling in Brnovich v. DNC, so a fair guess is that Mr. Garland succumbed to White House and progressive pressure to make a political statement to support Democratic efforts in Congress to federalize state election laws in H.R.1.<br />Bad call. Now federal judges hearing the case will have to contend with Justice Samuel Alito’s five principles in Brnovich as they assess the Georgia statute.<br />It won’t be easy to find legal fault under those principles. Mere voting inconvenience can’t be considered disqualifying, since all voting imposes some inconvenience. Any specific voting provision, such as the number of drop boxes, must also be considered in the overall context of a state’s voting rules. Georgia’s rules are generally lenient and don’t especially burden the ability of minorities to vote.<br />Perhaps Justice can find a federal judge somewhere to rule against Georgia, but such a ruling is unlikely to survive on appeal to higher courts. The legal and political result of the lawsuit is therefore likely to vindicate Georgia Republicans during the 2022 election season or leading up to 2024, depending on how the lawsuits proceed. Mr. Garland would be wise to drop the suit in light of Brnovich, lest his term at Justice be marred by the continuation of this patently political lawsuit.</td>

      <td>Columbus cut its income-tax rate while a judge upholds its right to do so.</td>
      <td>Ohio last week scored a double victory for taxpayers. Gov. Mike DeWine and the Legislature passed an income-tax cut that returns part of the state’s surplus to individuals and businesses. A legal victory also rolled back the Biden Administration’s attempt to seize control over state fiscal policy.<br />Federal Judge Douglas Cole on Thursday ruled in Ohio’s favor in its challenge to the American Rescue Plan Act, aka the March spending blowout. The law granted states $350 billion in aid but included a catch: The money could not be used to “either directly or indirectly offset a reduction in the net tax revenue.” The Biden Administration wants to steer funds to public employees instead of letting states cut taxes.<br />In blocking the tax-cut ban, Judge Cole criticized in particular the ambiguity of the mandate Washington placed on Ohio. The provision would let the Treasury Department challenge “essentially any reduction in the rate of any one or more state taxes,” he wrote, “even if other tax rates were increased.” His permanent injunction frees Columbus lawmakers from having to trade control over taxes for federal relief.<br />The judgment was well-timed, as the Legislature didn’t wait to put new tax cuts in place. On the same day as the ruling, Gov. DeWine signed the state’s 2021 budget, which lowers income-tax rates for all Ohio taxpayers. The reform eliminates the previous top rate of 4.8% on incomes above $221,000, and sets a new ceiling of 4% for all filers earning more than $111,000 a year. There are also rate cuts for each lower bracket.<br />Leaving more money in taxpayers’ hands makes sense amid a nationwide rebound in state tax revenue. Even without federal aid, states are benefiting from rising capital gains revenue from the housing and stock-market booms, as well as from recovering business sales. States such as New York and California are using the windfall to increase spending even more than they usually do, but Ohio is joining eight others that have cut taxes this year.</td>

      <td>An 1886 protectionist law gives Canada power over Alaskan tourism.</td>
      <td>When Canada in February temporarily banned cruise ships from its ports because of Covid-19, Alaska’s congressional delegation blasted the move. They said the decision threatened the Alaska cruise industry. What they didn’t mention is that the reason this industry is at the mercy of Canada is because of U.S. law.<br />That law is the 1886 Passenger Vessel Services Act (PVSA), a close cousin of the Jones Act, another barnacle on maritime trade and services. But while the Jones Act deals with cargo, the PVSA deals with passengers. It requires cruise vessels transporting people between U.S. ports to be American-flagged, American-built, American-owned and American-crewed. As the Alaska example shows, like all protectionism the law penalizes the very people it is intended to help.<br />“The PVSA is not America First,” said Utah’s Sen. Mike Lee on the Senate floor in April. “This is the encapsulation of Special Interests First. Or even, you might say, Canada First. Perhaps this is the reason that the Canadian government lobbies Congress to keep the PVSA in place.”<br />Canada likes the law because of a loophole that lets ships get around the PVSA so long as they stop at a foreign port in between their calls at U.S. ports. That means Canada for Alaskan cruise ships. So when Canada closed its ports, it effectively shut down the Alaska industry.<br />Tourism in general and cruise lines in particular are already reeling from the cancellations caused by Covid-19. An April report by Alaska’s government notes that the cruise industry accounts for $3 billion of the state’s economy. “The economies of many communities in Southeast Alaska,” it says, “are entirely dependent on tourism.”</td>

The listing on the New York Stock Exchange raised about $4.4 billion, making it the biggest stock sale for a Chinese company since  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ’s IPO in 2014.<br />Back in Beijing, officials, especially those at the Cyberspace Administration of China, remained wary of the ride-hailing company’s troves of data potentially falling into foreign hands as a result of greater public disclosure associated with a U.S. listing, the people said.<br />Didi’s American depositary shares began trading in New York on Wednesday, just a day before the ruling Communist Party celebrated its centenary.</td>

The DOJ alleged he committed fraud by using a corporate client’s information to make money for the bank at the client’s expense.<br />Propelling the case was an aggressive DOJ push, starting several years after the 2008 financial crisis, to pursue individual wrongdoing on Wall Street—a response in part to criticism from lawmakers and others that the government’ was too focused on extracting fines from banks without punishing people.<br />Sally Yates, who became deputy attorney general in 2015, formalized one of the strategies in a memo that year saying companies wouldn’t get full cooperation credit unless they turned over everything they knew about employees’ wrongdoing. Aiming for more lenient treatment for themselves, banks scoured their internal records for evidence of their own employees’ misconduct.</td>

      <td>An election-fraud rebuttal, a victory for integrity, and hopeful signs that voting patterns are changing.</td>
      <td>Democrats and the media have a simple rule about disputed elections: When Democrats complain about the result, there must have been something profoundly wrong with the process that rendered the outcome unreliable: dodgy ballots (Al Gore, Florida, 2000), corrupt machinery (John Kerry, Ohio, 2004), voter suppression (just about every election Democrats have lost in the south in the last 30 years but especially Stacey Abrams, Georgia, 2018).<br />When Republicans complain (Donald Trump, 2020), the challenge is an unconscionable threat to the foundations of our democracy, an assault on the sacred electoral process, a coup in plain sight.<br />So our consistent and principled defenders of election integrity face something of a conundrum in New York City after a Democratic mayoral primary election in a Democratic city has produced epic levels of electoral malarkey. All three leading Democratic candidates filed lawsuits last week raising the possibility of irregularities in counting and seeking legal relief in case the final result doesn’t go their way.<br />New York’s new ranked-choice voting system has combined with rank incompetence by the city’s Board of Elections to produce near total confusion about the result of the contest last month between Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president and former cop; Kathryn Garcia, the city’s former sanitation commissioner (who should know a thing or two about messy outcomes); and Maya Wiley, the far-left legal analyst for MSNBC.<br />One of them has to win, unfortunately, but we won’t know for a while the identity of the pol who will almost certainly be elected in November to succeed Bill de Blasio, a man for whom the term municipal disaster might have been invented.</td>

      <td>Its leaders warn of the threat from Beijing, but their budgets suggest otherwise.</td>
      <td>U.S. defense leaders have a problem: What they say doesn’t line up with what they do. The mismatch is apparent in the latest Pentagon budget, and a “say-do” gap undermines the trust of Congress and the American people.<br />Military leaders identify China as our No. 1 challenge, often calling Beijing “an increasingly capable strategic competitor,” as Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley has warned, or a “pacing” threat. Yet the budget request reduces the ability of the Navy and the Air Force—the services that would have outsize roles in any conflict in the Western Pacific—to respond to threats in that region. Meanwhile, the budget promises undeveloped weapons that may take decades to enter the fleet, funded by a “divest to invest” strategy.<br />The Navy wants to retire 15 ships, including seven guided-missile cruisers and four littoral combat ships, while procuring only two surface combatant ships and two submarines. (Congress’ budget draft would buy another destroyer and limit the retirements.) Naval aviation procurement dropped 15.6% over 2021 even as the Navy speeds up F/A-18 retirements. The USS Ronald Reagan, based in Japan to counter a threat from China, is overseeing the Afghanistan withdrawal in the Middle East because no other aircraft carrier is available. Meanwhile, China is building warships at an astonishing rate. In 2010 the U.S. Navy had 68 more ships than the Chinese navy. Today, it has 63 fewer, a swing of 131 ships in 10 years.<br />The Air Force is also following the Pentagon’s “divest to invest” lead. Combat aircraft procurement is down 22% from 2021. The force wants to retire 137 aircraft, more than double the number it plans to buy. After the retirement of 17 B-1s last year, the Air Force’s bomber inventory is at a level top officers have called the bare minimum. Ammunition procurement is down more than 40%. China in recent years has focused on procuring advanced aircraft and has the world’s third-largest air force. In addition, China has an extensive ground-based conventional missile force, including the DF-26, known as the “carrier killer” which is capable of striking Guam.<br />The defense budget tells the American people and allies that although we say China is a threat, we are not taking action to respond. Take Gen. Milley’s June 17 assessment of the threat that China will invade Taiwan: “I think the probability is probably low, in the immediate, near-term future.”</td>

I’m referring to the bear markets that began in September 1939 and July 1998, according to a calendar maintained by Ned Davis Research. The former lasted nearly three years while the latter lasted less than two months.<br />At the beginning of that longest bear market, the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio, or CAPE—the one made famous by Yale University finance professor and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller that is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the trailing decade—stood at 16.45. That is below the CAPE ratio’s long-term average, suggesting an undervalued stock market.<br />At the beginning of the shortest bear market, in contrast, the CAPE ratio was more than twice as high, at 38.3. That reading was higher than all prior readings back to 1871, according to data from Prof. Shiller, suggesting a severely overvalued market. And yet the ensuing bear market lasted less than two months.</td>

      <td>A bidding war is brewing for property-rich grocery chain WM Morrison only a few months after Walmart’s partial exit from the British market</td>
      <td>Walmart  executives must be upset. Months after the retail giant sold a majority stake in its British grocery chain Asda at a mediocre valuation, U.K. supermarkets are suddenly hot property among private-equity firms.<br />A bidding war is brewing for Britain’s fourth-largest food retailer by market share, WM Morrison. On Saturday, the company’s management gave the thumbs-up to a £6.3 billion all-cash takeover proposal by  SoftBank Group -backed buyout firm Fortress Investment Group—equivalent to $8.7 billion at current exchange rates. But that probably isn’t the end: Private-equity giant  Apollo Global Management  said Monday that it might make a rival offer. Morrisons has already rejected a £5.5 billion offer from a third suitor, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.<br />The Fortress proposal represented a 42% premium to the grocer’s undisturbed share price. The stock is trading above this level in a sign that investors expect higher offers. Private-equity firms clearly think that years of intense competition and sterling’s poor performance since the Brexit referendum have left British supermarket stocks too cheap.<br />The Walmart sale may also have alerted them to the value of grocers’ real estate. Asda, the No. 3 U.K. player ahead of Morrisons, has been a lucrative purchase for new owners TDR Capital and the U.K.-based Issa brothers. Last week, they sold the supermarket’s network of warehouses and distribution centers to  Blackstone Group  in a £1.7 billion deal. Thanks to this property sale, Asda’s owners have already recouped the roughly £800 million of equity they put in, plus enough for a special dividend if they wish—less than five months after closing the deal.<br />Morrisons looks ripe for similar treatment as it owns roughly 85% of its stores. The supermarket’s property assets are valued at £5.8 billion on its books, but could fetch higher prices now. Grocery sales benefited from the pandemic as consumers cooked more meals at home. Some of the extra spending is likely to stick, with a knock-on effect on the underlying real estate, even as Britain’s social-distancing rules ease.</td>

I served in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside soldiers of every race and background. We saw each other as fellow Americans and fellow soldiers, prepared to lay down our lives for each other and our country if necessary.<br />Every minute of training spent on charlatans like Ibram X. Kendi at best is wasted time better devoted to tactical and operational excellence, but at worst and more likely is a corrosive blow to the intangible qualities needed to fight and win in war.<br />And that, let us recall, is the central mission of our military. If it ever fails, the consequences are not just, say, shareholder losses or more unemployable college graduates, but the eclipse of America by adversaries like Communist China. Those are the stakes.

Consumers are overreliant on intermittent power-generation sources such as wind that sometimes aren’t there when we need them most. Meanwhile, most natural gas is sold based on monthly average price contracts, not spot price. Natural-gas producers saved tens of thousands of lives this winter, but they didn’t set prices or reap windfalls. Like farmers and ranchers, they take the price set by regional and global markets. The market signals were a vast and lengthy wind drought plus extreme demand for home heating and natural-gas power generation. The culprits behind this winter’s utility-bill price spike are supply and demand, a generational weather event and policy overreach in the name of climate virtue at consumers’ behest.<br />Brook A.

      <td>Supply is tight on the grid even before peak summer heat. Though genuine wear and tear could be the culprit, market manipulation isn’t out of the question.</td>
      <td>It isn’t even close to the peak of Texas’s sizzling summer season and already the state’s power grid has given out two warnings of tight conditions after a higher-than-usual volume of plants went offline. Wear and tear from the February winter storm is one possible explanation; market manipulation is another. They aren’t mutually exclusive.<br />Warm weather and low wind output played a role, but what was surprising about the alerts—one in April, the other in June—was the number of power plants that were offline at the same time. On June 14, the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s grid operator, said some 11 gigawatts of generation (roughly 15% of that day’s peak load forecast and enough to power 2.2 million homes in the summer) was on forced outage for repairs. In April, Ercot had said roughly 33 GW of generation was out of service for maintenance. Of course, that isn’t entirely surprising after the February disaster that strained the entire system and left millions without power.<br />The exact causes of the outages aren’t all accounted for. Texas regulators on Wednesday ordered Ercot to release that kind of information within three days instead of the usual 60 days for any outages that occur this summer. Ercot is expected to release information on the June outages this week. While that will offer some color, it likely won’t be the full story, especially given that the information will be based on whatever the power plants have told Ercot. The independent market monitor, Potomac Economics, will investigate whether any market manipulation took place in those two events.<br />The tight supply conditions are a reminder of two separate but potentially compounding risks of a grid that offers large carrots in times of market tightness (up to $9,000 a megawatt-hour) but barely any sticks for being unavailable. Such a market gives generators little reason to maintain their power plants beyond the bare minimum, increasing the chances of unplanned outages. Secondly, in such a market, manipulation—withholding power from certain plants to reap outsize profits from others—is tempting. The combination seems to make for a potentially reinforcing spiral of risks, especially given the worn-down physical and financial state of power plants in Texas after the February storm.<br />The most obvious culprit for the outages is the storm itself, which left the grid severely strained. Beth Garza, former director of Ercot’s independent market monitor, pointed out that the June outages occurred on a Monday and that it isn’t uncommon for power plants to plan to go offline over the weekend for a quick fix only to have that outage extended because repairs took longer than expected.</td>

The Pentagon said last week that the withdrawal will be completed by the end of August, a few weeks earlier than expected when President Biden said forces would be out by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that prompted the move into Afghanistan in the first place.<br />The departure impulse is bipartisan. Former President Donald Trump announced while he was still in office that all forces would be gone this year; Mr. Biden is following through.</td>

You will need to do more planning than normal, since rules can vary between countries, even within the European Union. If you don’t usually buy travel insurance, you might want to reconsider this year.

      <td>Sparsely vaccinated developing countries have been left exposed while shots protect wealthy nations from surges in hospitalizations and deaths</td>
      <td>SINGAPORE—The fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus is driving up infections around the world, both in countries that have achieved large-scale vaccination and those that haven’t. There is one crucial difference, though: Vaccines are helping wealthy nations escape steep rises in severe cases and deaths while developing countries short on shots battle deadly surges.<br />Indonesia, where Covid-19 cases have reached new highs, has reported about 500 deaths a day in the past week—almost triple the daily levels recorded in early June—data from its health ministry shows. Authorities are racing to add hospital beds as medical workers in parts of the country face shortages of ventilators and isolation rooms. Patients are traveling for hours for proper medical care, said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which runs a hospital in West Java province and recently set up emergency tents on-site to accommodate the flow.<br />“Every day we are seeing this Delta variant driving Indonesia closer to the edge of a Covid-19 catastrophe,” Jan Gelfand, who leads the group’s delegation in the country, said recently. “We need lightning-fast action globally so that countries like Indonesia have access to the vaccines needed to avert tens of thousands of deaths.”<br />In the U.K., by contrast, the variant is dominant and has pushed reported daily cases up by 67% in the past week compared with the week before, but deaths are down 1.6%, government data shows. Israel, another wealthy nation with high inoculation levels, has reported small new outbreaks but just one fatality in the last two weeks of June, according to data from the World Health Organization. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the U.S., where the variant is highly prevalent, says that vaccines are effective against it. “If you look at the share of the population fully vaccinated in the United States and world-wide, they’re dramatically different, as is the dynamics of infection,” he said.<br />The divergence is the result of months of inequitable vaccine supply that has left the developing world exposed. The U.S. and U.K. have fully inoculated about half their populations, but across the African continent, just over 1% of people have been fully vaccinated. Mortuaries in Zambia are full and patients are dying in hospital hallways in South Africa waiting for care.</td>

Witnesses saw soldiers leap out to try to save themselves in the moments before the aircraft crashed into a patch of thick brush and palm trees, according to a statement and photographs provided by the Joint Task Force Sulu, the military’s local unit. Of those aboard, 47 were killed and 49 were injured, military spokesman Marine Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo said Monday following a rescue mission that continued late into the previous night.<br />The photographs provided by the Joint Task Force showed thick smoke billowing from the crash site as rescuers rummaged through the wreckage for survivors, surrounded by tropical vegetation and the outskirts of a small village. Little appeared to be left of the aircraft, with the tail number 5125 still visible amid the debris, after an explosion caused by the impact.<br />The Joint Task Force said the plane was carrying new army privates deployed to fight militants. “They were supposed to join us in our fight against terrorism,” unit commander Gen. William N. Gonzales said in a statement.<br />The island of Jolo has long been a battleground between the Philippine military and Abu Sayyaf, a small insurgent group affiliated with Islamic State, which is designated as a terrorist organization by governments including the Philippines and the U.S. The group was behind the 2004 bombing of a ferry near Manila that killed 116 people, according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center.</td>

Doxing refers to the practice of putting people’s personal information online so they can be harassed by others.<br />Hong Kong’s Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau in May proposed amendments to the city’s data-protection laws that it said were needed to combat doxing, a practice that was prevalent during 2019 protests in the city. The proposals call for punishments of up to 1 million Hong Kong dollars, the equivalent of about $128,800, and up to five years’ imprisonment.<br />“The only way to avoid these sanctions for technology companies would be to refrain from investing and offering the services in Hong Kong,” said the previously unreported June 25 letter from the Singapore-based Asia Internet Coalition, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Tensions have emerged between some of the U.S.’s most powerful firms and Hong Kong authorities as Beijing exerts increasing control over the city and clamps down on political dissent. The American firms and other tech companies last year said they were suspending the processing of requests from Hong Kong law-enforcement agencies following China’s imposition of a national security law on the city.</td>

China moved quickly to get the coronavirus pandemic under control and became the only major economy to eke out a full-year expansion.<br />But stocks have lost ground after peaking in February. Since then, China’s credit growth has slowed, debt problems have rattled the country’s developers and financial firms and authorities have gotten tougher on sectors like education and technology. A rise in global bond yields has also dented investor appetite for riskier stocks.<br />The result:  MSCI Inc.’s  China index was up just 1.1% for the year through June 30, trailing the equivalent global benchmark by 11 percentage points. In relative terms, that was the worst first-half performance in eight years for the MSCI China, which includes both onshore and offshore stocks.<br />Since Chinese stocks are now trading at modest valuations—with a lot of bad news already priced in and economic growth likely to remain robust—investors say the second half of 2021 will likely improve. Still, the outlook for tech giants that dominate international China stock indexes remains murky—and the companies continue to struggle—so it will be hard for the broader market to make much of an advance.</td>

      <td>Beijing’s crackdown shows that successfully listing, especially on a foreign stock exchange, doesn’t mean a company is safe from regulators</td>
      <td>U.S. and international investors are taking it on the nose as Beijing ramps up its crackdown on Chinese internet-technology companies—many of which are listed abroad—over data security. But in the long-run, the damage to one of China’s previously fastest-growing, most dynamic sectors could be even more significant.<br />On Sunday, regulators ordered the removal of the app of Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi from the country’s app stores, saying the company had illegally collected and utilized personal data. The move came just days after Didi’s successful $4.4 billion initial public offering in New York. China’s internet watchdog had previously announced a cybersecurity review of Didi last Friday, banning the company from accepting new users. And the stock is set to go into major indexes such as those from MSCI and FTSE later this month.<br />Didi is the most high-profile target of the actions over the past few days, but it isn’t the only newly U.S.-listed Chinese tech company to take a hit. Apps including that of truck-hailing company  Full Truck Alliance ,  also known as Manbang, and of online-recruiting platform Kanzhun also face similar probes and can’t take in new users, according to a notice Monday. Both companies went public in the U.S. last month. SoftBank, which is a top investor in Didi and Manbang, fell 5.4% Monday. Its Vision Fund owns around 20% of both companies.<br />Chinese regulators had previously halted Ant Group’s dual listings in Hong Kong and Shanghai at the last minute in November. But this latest crackdown shows that successfully listing, especially on a foreign stock exchange, doesn’t mean a company is safe from regulators either.<br />Apart from the recent onslaught of antitrust and financial regulation for Chinese Big Tech, these new actions reflect another growing obsession of Beijing’s: data security and sovereignty. The probes into the three companies fall under an existing cybersecurity law, but China’s legislature also passed a new data-security law last month that goes into effect in September. That will mean more intense scrutiny over handling and collection of data, which is the bread and butter of most tech firms. Shares of Chinese technology companies such as Alibaba and Tencent also fell Monday.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—A group of infrastructure investors submitted a nearly $17 billion takeover bid for Sydney Airport, the operator of Australia’s busiest airport, signaling that investors are willing to bet big on post-pandemic travel.<br />The consortium—which comprises Australian pension fund managers IFM Investors and QSuper as well as New York-based Global Infrastructure Partners—offered 8.25 Australian dollars, the equivalent of US$6.20, a share for Sydney Airport. The airport is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the few publicly traded large airports. Sydney Airport shares rose more than 30% to A$7.78 on the news.<br />A deal would be the largest merger or acquisition on record for Australia, according to data provider Dealogic.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic largely brought international travel to a standstill when borders were shut last year to stop the coronavirus from spreading. Governments spent billions of dollars propping up airlines to keep the industry afloat. Although domestic travel has started to bounce back in some countries, the international recovery is expected to take longer.<br />Investors, however, said it was a good time for the consortium, which is calling itself the Sydney Aviation Alliance, to bid for Sydney Airport because the airport’s stock price was looking cheap. Before the bid became public on Monday, the airport’s shares had fallen more than 30% from pre-pandemic levels. Australia’s borders are still largely closed to visitors. Health experts have credited the policy with limiting the spread of Covid-19 there, but the airport’s international traffic remains down more than 90%.</td>

      <td>Advertisers have begun shifting their spending patterns in the months since Apple Inc. began requiring apps to gain iPhone and iPad users’ permission to track them.<br />After the tracking change took effect in April, many users of Apple’s iOS operating system have received a high volume of prompts from apps asking permission to track them—requests that most have declined. Less than 33% of iOS users opt in to tracking, according to ad-measurement firm Branch Metrics Inc.<br />As a result, the prices for mobile ads directed at iOS users have fallen, while ad prices have risen for advertisers seeking to target Android users. Those shifts come after many in the digital-ad industry warned that Apple’s changes, which the tech giant framed as part of a broader user-privacy crackdown, would limit advertisers’ access to data about consumers and hurt their business.<br />Digital advertisers say they have lost much of the granular data that made mobile ads on iOS devices effective and justified their prices. In recent months, ad-buyers have deployed their iOS ad spending in much less targeted ways than were previously possible, marketers and ad-tech companies say. The shortage of user data to fuel  Facebook Inc.’s  suite of powerful ad-targeting tools reduces their effectiveness and appeal among some advertisers, ad agencies say.<br />Apple, for its part, sells ads only in a handful of its own apps and doesn’t take a cut of ad revenue in third-party iOS apps. While advertisers have shifted their spending habits across the ad products of Apple’s large rivals Facebook and Google—which depend much more heavily on ad revenue—it isn’t clear yet how the change has affected overall spending across the digital-ad giants.</td>

Yet large-cap pharmaceutical companies have pulled back on acquisitions this year, as they pay down debt from previous sprees and resist high premiums.<br />Instead, medium-size pharmaceutical companies, which had been targets of their larger peers, have spent the most on acquisitions fueled by the new sources of capital and the need to find growth for the long haul.<br />Midcap drug companies have struck nine deals valued at $13.1 billion so far this year, about twice what larger pharmaceutical companies spent on eight acquisitions during the period, according to pharmaceutical data provider Evaluate Group Ltd.<br />Among the biggest deals across the industry this year was an agreement by midsize  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  PLC in May to buy cannabinoid drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals PLC for $6.7 billion.</td>

That even trumped the amount retail traders spent in January during the first meme-stock frenzy.<br />The activity underscores the enduring influence of ordinary investors in markets. When the Covid-19 pandemic ushered in a wave of first-time traders, many market observers suspected these investors would retreat when the economy reopened.<br />Instead, individual investors have grown in number: More than 10 million new brokerage accounts are estimated to have been opened in the first half of this year, according to JMP Securities. That is around the total for all of 2020.<br />Retail investors’ enthusiasm is in contrast to professional money managers’ growing unease about the market’s outlook. This has risen as markets on the surface appear placid, but volatility has grown around individual stocks.</td>

They’re reassured that they can get a refund if they cancel.<br />The more-infectious Delta variant has quickly spread around the world, and is now the most common strain of the Covid-19 virus circulating in the U.S. An analysis of genetic sequencing data as of June 27 showed that the Delta strain now makes up about 40% of positive Covid-19 test samples, according to Helix, a population genomics company that collects and analyzes test samples from several U.S. states.<br />The CDC has said that fully vaccinated Americans are well protected, even against variants. But children under the age of 12 aren’t yet eligible for vaccination.<br />Children are still at far less risk than adults for severe complications or death from the virus. Most children who get Covid-19 still have mild or asymptomatic cases. There is no indication that young adults and children are more vulnerable proportionately to the Delta variant than other age groups, and any pockets of increased transmission mostly reflect the fact that they haven’t been immunized, scientists say. “There’s no evidence it’s more severe in children,” says Monica Gandhi, an infectious-diseases doctor at the University of California, San Francisco.</td>

He is accused by Spain’s Court of Auditors, an administrative body that oversees public accounts, of participating in an alleged misuse of millions of euros by allegedly helping to promote Catalonia’s quest for independence from Spain, which culminated in an illegal referendum in 2017.<br />On Tuesday, the Court of Auditors imposed a penalty of up to €2.8 million on Mr. Mas-Colell, equivalent to about $3.3 million, as part of proceedings against 34 former Catalan officials accused of illegally spending a total of €5.4 million. The accused have to pay the heavy penalties before they can appeal against them in court.<br />Mr. Mas-Colell, whose textbook on microeconomics is widely used at U.S. universities, has been a professor at Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley, as well as in Spain. The accusations against him have sparked an outcry among fellow economists in the U.S., Europe and Asia.<br />“Those of us who have treated professor Mas-Colell for many years as colleagues, students, and co-authors know that he is a person of the utmost integrity,” wrote 54 prominent economists from around the world in a letter published in the Spanish newspaper El País on June 22.

The business leaders fear calls for decoupling from China, similar to ones in the U.S.<br />“We have to make this work,” ERT member Jacob Wallenberg said of commercial relations between China and the West. Mr. Wallenberg, who is chairman of Swedish holding company Investor AB and deputy chairman of telecommunications giant  Ericsson  AB, said China has begun opening its banking, insurance and other sectors under EU and U.S. pressure, and such pressure could improve the West’s business position with China.<br />“Is it perfect?

She said she didn’t believe officials had adequately prepared to implement the new system and said the hearings would touch on longstanding concerns about the structure of the Board of Elections.<br />“There are a number of proposals for reforms to the Board of Elections, so we’re going through our process of figuring out what vehicle will get us there,” Ms. Walker said.<br />Officials at the board said a human error was behind last week’s gaffe, in which they released a preliminary tabulation of the mayoral race using the city’s new ranked-choice voting system and later retracted the results. The board said that the tally had inadvertently included 135,000 test-run ballots. A day later, the board released a new preliminary tabulation that it said was accurate and showed Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams with a narrow lead over former city sanitation commissioner Kathryn Garcia.</td>

      <td>At first glance, the phrase doesn’t make sense. Here is how Wall Street turns bad news into good.</td>
      <td>With some frequency, Wall Street professionals use this phrase: “Bad news for the economy is good news for the stock market.” They also use it in reverse, with good news for the economy said to be bad for stocks.<br />At first glance, whichever way you read it, the line might seem to make little sense. Many people see the economy and the stock market as inextricably linked. In their minds, if the economy is weakening, then surely company profits will suffer, which will end up sending stock prices lower. But that’s not always the case.<br />It’s only when looking deeper that things become clearer, but even then, there are some subtleties to navigate.<br />“A little bit of bad news is good for markets,” says Bruce Monrad, chairman and portfolio manager at Boston-based mutual-fund company Northeast Investors Trust. It all revolves around the response by the Federal Reserve to economic news. When the news for the economy is bad, such as a sudden unexpected rise in the unemployment rate, then it is less likely that the Fed’s monetary-policy committee will raise the cost of borrowing money—a key variable for both business and consumer finances. That tends to help keep prices for stocks and bonds buoyant, Mr. Monrad says.<br />But too much bad news is indeed bad for stocks. “The bad news can’t be so bad that it brings into question future earnings,” Mr. Monrad says. For instance, in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, news of the global viral outbreak sent markets into a tailspin starting around mid-February 2020 through late March. The S&P 500 index dropped more than 30% over that period, in anticipation of the pandemic’s economic impact. The U.S. economy shrank at an annualized rate of 31% in the second quarter of last year, government statistics show.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden will host a July Fourth celebration at the White House, using the event to mark his administration’s progress against the coronavirus pandemic, while acknowledging the work ahead with the nationwide vaccination campaign.<br />Mr. Biden has for months cited Independence Day as a moment when Americans could see a return to something like normalcy, saying early in his presidency that he hoped families would be able to gather for the holiday. More than 50% of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, and Covid-19 cases have plummeted from the winter highs.<br />Businesses are reopening and the economy is recovering. The weekend is expected to be a busy one for travel, with Americans hitting the road after a year of lockdowns.<br />But vaccinations have slowed in recent months, and the White House recently acknowledged that the U.S. wouldn’t reach the president’s goal of getting at least one coronavirus vaccine dose to 70% of the adult population by July 4. The highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus is spreading rapidly. And a recent surge in the inflation rate has some economists worried about the economy overheating.<br />“It’s a holiday weekend. I’m going to celebrate it. There’s great things happening,” Mr. Biden said at a White House event Friday. “All across America people are going to ballgames and doing good things.”</td>

      <td>USA Today publisher sees Reviewed as potential engine for digital growth, seeking to cash in on e-commerce boom</td>
      <td>Newspaper publisher  Gannett Co.  has doubled the number of staffers at its product-review website over the past 18 months, looking to expand its digital reach as print advertising and circulation revenues face continued pressure.<br />The Gannett site, called Reviewed, is taking direct aim at Wirecutter, a popular products-review site owned by the  New York Times Co. , and BestReviews, a similar rival that  Nexstar Media Group Inc.  acquired last year for $160 million in cash. Gannett operates more than 250 newspapers, including USA Today.<br />The push comes after e-commerce surged and ad spending declined for a time during the Covid-19 pandemic, increasing pressure on media organizations to hunt for new revenue streams and to shore up their digital businesses.<br />“Top-line revenue has grown 50% every year for the last three years, and our projections for 2021 are around the same percentage,” said Chris Lloyd, general manager of Reviewed. He declined to provide dollar revenues.<br />Mr. Lloyd said the site’s staff has increased to 80 full-time employees. Most new hires are editors and writers who work at the company’s 25,000-square-foot testing lab in Cambridge, Mass. Reviews are published online at Reviewed.com and across the USA Today Network, meaning any of Gannett’s newspapers can run articles written by Reviewed staffers.</td>

      <td>In iBuying, just because you bet on technology, it doesn’t mean you’re a winner</td>
      <td>Everyone wants to be a tech company. Office-sharing, meat substitution, ride-hailing, fashion styling, fitness—they are all technology businesses, according to founders who covet the highflying valuations the appellation can garner in the public markets.<br />But just having technology doesn’t automatically make an investment superior. Consider real estate’s digital home flipping: Here is a business that is undoubtedly “tech” but where the value of the technology isn’t yet clear. With iBuyer Offerpad’s merger with blank-check firm Supernova Partners expected to close early this quarter, the value of technology—or lack thereof—is something that online real-estate investors will want to consider as they place their bets in a crowded field.<br />So-called “pure play” iBuyers Offerpad and competitor  Opendoor Technologies  both describe themselves as technology companies. Opendoor says it is a “digital platform for residential real estate.” Offerpad says it is focused on “tech-enabled real estate solutions.” Both companies have a chief technology officer and some version of a data scientist, presumably there to hone the technology investments and analyze their utility.<br />These companies may be solving similar pain points in seamlessly digitizing real-estate transactions, but they seem to be approaching the problem in different ways—Opendoor with money and Offerpad with experience. As of its March presentation, Offerpad said it had raised less than 9% of what SoftBank-fueled Opendoor had, though it had bought and subsequently sold 38% as many homes. And whereas Offerpad is led by a former real-estate agent, Opendoor is led by someone from the real estate technology business.<br />Opendoor’s deep pockets have no doubt fueled its rapid growth. It is now active in 39 markets with the stated goal of entering 42 by year-end—double the number of markets Offerpad is targeting this year, despite being only one year younger. But bigger doesn’t necessarily mean better: Opendoor lost far more money last year.</td>

      <td>LONDON—In the stressful months that preceded Euro 2020, as England manager Gareth Southgate contemplated his squad for the tournament, he had no idea what his strongest lineup might be this summer.<br />Southgate was staring at England’s most gifted crop of attacking players in a generation. There was potential to light up this European Championship with offense. England, for once, might even be fun to watch.<br />That’s when Southgate, one of the coolest heads in international soccer, decided to run in the other direction. If England was going to make its first final in 45 years, Southgate knew he would have to fix the back line first. He took an often ropey goalkeeper, a central defender prone to spectacular errors, a fullback once cast aside by Jose Mourinho, and a monolith nicknamed Slabhead and turned them into the best defense in the European game.<br />Through five games at this tournament, including Saturday night’s 4-0 drubbing of Ukraine in the quarterfinals, England has yet to concede a single goal. England will play Denmark in the semifinals on Wednesday in London, a day after Italy and Spain face off in the other semi.<br />“That’s what we’re building on,” captain Harry Kane said after his side punched its ticket to Wednesday’s semifinal against Denmark. “It’s the final part of winning games and winning tournaments.”</td>

Just as the taxman forces you to use dollars to pay your taxes, electronic ransom demands have been set in bitcoin, forcing companies, individuals and even some governments to use the cryptocurrency if they wish to regain control of their computer systems.<br />If this sounds wacky, bear with me. Before getting into the full explanation, we need a brief tour of theories of money. The most widely accepted is that money was created because early humans found it so inconvenient to barter with pigs, llamas or berries. It would be much easier to swap my llamas for widely accepted items—cowrie shells, fancy feather boas or carved stones—and then swap those items again for grain than it would be to find someone with grain who happened to want llamas.<br />Money was also a means of accounting for debts; easier still than using cowrie shells would be to take the grain now, get some notches on a tally stick, and later provide llamas, or grain, or whatever was promised to pay off the debt.<br />The first of these theories focuses on money as a means of exchange, an area where bitcoin has floundered because of the cost and hassle required to actually buy something in bitcoin. Only when its anonymity and international nature help enough to offset these disadvantages, such as in evading money-laundering laws, taxes and capital controls, is it much used. The rest of bitcoin trading is speculation and exchange arbitrage.<br />The second theory focuses on money’s role as a unit of account, an area where bitcoin hasn’t had any success so far. Even in El Salvador, where bitcoin is being made legal tender, stuff will still be priced first in dollars, then translated into bitcoin for anyone paying in crypto.</td>

There could be a few dozen stocks in a particular fund, or thousands. Some funds merely try to match the market, so you’ll be riding along with Wall Street’s overall gains or losses, while others target specific sectors (like tech stocks), which could zoom or drop apart from the overall market. Some funds are even highly leveraged (you’ll see 2x or 3x in their names), which ramps up the risk.</td>

The Kaseya incident appears to be the “largest and most significant” such attack to date, said Brett Callow, a threat analyst for cybersecurity company Emsisoft.<br />Upon learning of the attack Friday, Kaseya immediately shut down its servers and began warning customers, the company said. As of Friday evening only customers running the software on their own servers, rather than users of Kaseya’s online service, appear to have been affected, the company said.<br />The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency advised Kaseya users to shut down their VSA servers immediately. “CISA is closely monitoring this situation and we are working with the FBI to gather information about its impact,” said Eric Goldstein, the agency’s executive assistant director for cybersecurity, in a statement.</td>

      <td>Americans light up the sky to celebrate independence from Britain. But colorful combustibles, like their name, hail from the old world.</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />If there’s one word that Americans associate with Fourth of July festivities, it’s “fireworks”—a term that has been used continually since the country’s earliest Independence Day celebrations.<br />In 1777, the year after the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia marked the anniversary with “a grand exhibition of fireworks, which began and concluded with thirteen rockets on the commons, and the city was beautifully illuminated,” according to one dispatch.<br />The fireworks celebrated independence from Great Britain, but both the colorful combustibles and the common name for them were direct imports from the new nation’s erstwhile colonizers. Fireworks themselves were first developed in China, the home of gunpowder. But the word for them entered English in the early 16th century, likely influenced by comparable words in Dutch (“vuurwerk”) and German (“Feuerwerk”).<br />Originally, all of these terms referred to the military use of explosive devices, particularly gunpowder charges. During the reign of Henry VIII, English forces held control over Calais in northern France, and a document dated to 1528 specified the components of “fyre worke” that would be needed to defend the city from assault by French troops.</td>

      <td>In John Trumbull’s historic picture ‘Declaration of Indpendence,’ the philosophical Thomas Jefferson and the pious John Adams represent two poles of the American creed.</td>
      <td>The most famous image of America’s founding, John Trumbull’s painting “Declaration of Independence,” does not depict the events of July 4, 1776. Rather, it portrays a scene that took place on June 28, when Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Livingston and Roger Sherman presented the Declaration to the Continental Congress. Trumbull, who began his career as an artist after serving as an aide-de-camp to George Washington in the Continental Army, made his first small painting of this scene in the 1790s. In 1818 he completed a larger version, which several years later was placed in the Capitol, where it still hangs today.<br />John Adams, one of the few surviving founders, was wary of the project. The story of the Revolution, he wrote to Trumbull, was a complex layering of events and individuals. To reduce it to a single scene was dishonest: “Let not our Posterity be deluded by fictions under pretense of poetical or graphical Licenses.”<br />Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, embraced Trumbull’s use of artistic license; without it, he wrote, “the talent of imagination would be banished from the art.” In fact, as the art historian Paul Stiati has written, the original painting had been Jefferson’s suggestion, which helps to explain why Trumbull made the author of the Declaration stand out, resplendent in a red vest and grasping the document in his hands. At first glance, “Declaration of Independence” seems to celebrate Jefferson as the author of America itself.<br />But as the historian David McCullough has pointed out, while Jefferson is prominent, it is Adams, the chief advocate of independence in the Continental Congress, who occupies the center of the canvas. Every other founder’s physique is partially obscured, while Adams can be seen in his entirety. Most great paintings give us one focal point, but this one has two.<br />This is appropriate, because Adams and Jefferson can be seen as the two intellectual poles of the Revolution. Jefferson was an ardent admirer of the Enlightenment and believed that the American founding would “show by example the sufficiency of human reason for the care of human affairs.” Adams also appreciated the power of reason, but like Edmund Burke across the Atlantic, he emphasized the importance of religious and moral tradition in preserving society.</td>

Would the selection we’ve grown accustomed to on  Amazon  shrink, as the company has intimated? Would  Facebook  being forced to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp break those services, as Facebook would have us believe? And would the quality of Google search be degraded by its inability to feature its own services, such as Google Maps and YouTube videos, in results? Or, as the companies’ critics would have it, will life be better for users, competitors and society if all those things come to pass?<br />Those questions gained new significance last month when the House Judiciary Committee, with bipartisan support, approved a half dozen bills that signaled fresh willingness to break up the Faaam, as I like to call the tech-titan quintet. ( Microsoft ,  so far, has largely avoided the crosshairs.)<br />Given the torturous process of federal lawmaking, the chances of these bills becoming law in their present form aren’t high, and any movement could be slow. Congress is preoccupied with other battles at the moment. The companies, their lobbyists, and allies are already pushing back forcefully against this legislation, and against the new head of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, who has criticized tech giants. A federal judge’s decision this past week dismissing antitrust lawsuits against Facebook for being “legally insufficient” suggests that implementing stricter rules won’t be easy.<br />But the chances are clearly rising that something like the provisions in these bills could become the rules by which Big Tech must abide—through an act of Congress, laws at the state level, court battles, a new crop of regulators like Ms. Khan or bipartisan political will to move against tech.</td>

      <td>Investors have continued to plow money into ETFs with themes this year, favoring concepts and trends ranging from clean technology to legal cannabis.<br />Thematic exchange-traded funds saw fund inflows of about $38.8 billion in the first half, compared with $7.8 billion in the first half of 2020, according to Morningstar Inc. There are now 191 such funds with a combined $164.2 billion in assets, up from 55 funds and $11.2 billion in assets five years ago.<br />Investors are shifting “from buying individual ‘story’ stocks to thematic ETFs to get diversification in some of the hottest growth markets in the world,” says Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA’s senior director of ETF and head of mutual-fund research.<br />To be sure, themed funds are riskier than ETFs that follow the broader market and can tank when enough investors start to think a trend has run its course. Cloud computing, for example, while still seen as a strong trend for the long term, has lost momentum recently as the pandemic has started to wane and fewer people are working remotely. Through June 30, ETFs based on cloud computing have seen net outflows of $600 million this year, Morningstar reports.<br />The Wall Street Journal asked a number of ETF experts to identify themes they believe are likely to produce strong returns for years to come.

      <td>The New York region’s Kushner real-estate family is expanding its investments in Southeastern states as it waits for the local commercial property sales market to reopen from the pandemic.<br />The family, which gained global attention during the Trump administration because of the senior White House role played by Jared Kushner, has either purchased or signed contracts to buy 2,500 apartments in Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia in the past month. The total price was about $400 million, according to Laurent Morali, the president of New York-based Kushner Cos.<br />Mr. Kushner, the son of family patriarch Charles Kushner as well as former President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, has played no role in the southeastern acquisition strategy, which Kushner Cos. launched before the Trump presidency ended, Mr. Morali said. The company was run by Charles Kushner, his daughter, Nicole Kushner Meyer, and Mr. Morali during the Trump years, and Jared Kushner’s role in the family business since he moved to Florida in January hasn’t been announced.<br />Kushner Cos., which has a total real-estate portfolio valued at $15 billion, has been investing in suburban apartment buildings for decades. It began focusing on small to midsize cities in Southeastern cities, such as Memphis, Tenn., and Williamsburg, Va., last fall, partly because big investors have been driving up prices in larger cities.<br />The family’s recent deals included its purchase of 1,200 units in Jackson, Miss., for $160 million. Average rents are $1,000 a month for a two-bedroom unit and $900 for a one-bedroom unit, Mr. Morali said. Kushner Cos. found Jackson attractive because its economy has been strong thanks to stable local employers, including the state government and a  Nissan  assembly plant that opened in 2003, he said.</td>

His trial will be the first of a churchman with his rank in Vatican City’s criminal court.<br />Pope Francis ordered an investigation in 2019 after the Vatican bank flagged as suspicious a request by the Secretariat of State for a €150-million loan to refinance the acquisition costs of a building in London’s upscale Chelsea district.<br />Through a series of complex transactions, the secretariat had paid the equivalent of more than $400 million by 2018 for the property, which had sold for half that amount six years earlier, Vatican prosecutors told a London court last year. The Vatican was seeking the extradition of a middleman, Gianluigi Torzi, accused of extortion, embezzlement, fraud and money laundering.<br />In September of last year, Cardinal Becciu renounced his Vatican post and the rights of a cardinal, though not his title, at the request of Pope Francis. The Vatican didn’t give a reason for the move at that time.</td>

Justice Barrett likewise didn’t join calls by other conservatives to take up some potentially divisive hot-button cases, including several aiming to limit LGBT rights.<br />“She came away as a careful member of the court who is not going to be throwing bombs or making sweeping pronouncements, but judging cases on an individual basis,” said University of Iowa law professor Derek Muller, who studied under Justice Barrett when she taught at Notre Dame Law School. Some Republicans, he said, were disappointed that several of her cases didn’t reach outcomes more in line with their political priorities.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court’s term, conducted in the unprecedented disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic, included notes of consensus among the nine justices after the conservative majority expanded in October.<br />But the term, which ended this week, also saw the newly expanded conservative majority prevailing in several major decisions, favoring state sovereignty over claims of discrimination against minority voters, the anonymity of nonprofit donors over government auditors and corporate defendants over class-action plaintiffs, among others.<br />The conservative wing divided, however, over how much and how fast to change interpretations of the law, with Chief Justice John Roberts, often followed by the two newest justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, at times putting the brakes on their colleagues Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.<br />“I think it’s still the Roberts Court,” said Vikram Amar, dean of the University of Illinois College of Law. The triumvirate led by the chief justice often appears to decide “how much law is made and in what direction it’s going,” Mr. Amar said.<br />That was evident Friday, when over the objection of some more-conservative justices the court declined to revisit landmark precedents including  New York Times Co.  v. Sullivan, a 1964 decision affording wide protection to the news media; and Kelo v. New London, a 2005 ruling granting authorities broad discretion to condemn private property for public purposes when just compensation is paid.</td>

So it is a big deal for everybody.”<br />Game makers are jockeying to expand their user bases by reaching billions of people on the device they tend to use most, a smartphone, according to company executives and analysts. The moves come as industry revenue from mobile games is projected to continue rising in 2021, while revenue from PC and console games—which boomed during the pandemic as people were stuck at home—is projected to decline.<br />U.S. companies this year have already spent more on mergers and acquisitions for mobile-gaming studios than in all of 2020, according to research firm PitchBook Data Inc. There is a “race for scale” going on in mobile to acquire the largest user bases, said Doug Creutz, an analyst at investment bank  Cowen Inc.,  and more users mean more revenue.</td>

      <td>Congress, White House so far appear unwilling to take sweeping actions to cancel student debt</td>
      <td>The Biden administration is considering extending a pandemic freeze on Americans’ student-loan payments beyond its scheduled expiration in September and turning to piecemeal measures to lower their student-debt bills.<br />Five months into his term, President Biden has resisted calls from fellow Democrats and activists to cancel most of America’s $1.6 trillion in federal student-loan debt in one swoop through an executive action. Congress also appears unlikely to make it happen because Democrats lack the Republican support they would need to pass such a measure.<br />Yet many Americans effectively are seeing their debt bills reduced through policy changes that started under the Trump administration, which froze student-loan payments when the pandemic began unfolding in March 2020. The move, which the Biden administration extended through September, has in effect forgiven tens of billions of dollars in student debt that families otherwise would have paid, mostly by waiving interest charges.<br />Mr. Biden’s education secretary, Miguel Cardona, told a congressional panel last month that the administration is considering extending the payment freeze beyond September. Asked for comment on that possibility, an administration official said Mr. Biden “continues to look into what debt-relief actions can be taken administratively.” The official restated Mr. Biden’s desire for Congress to pass a law to forgive $10,000 in student debt for every federal borrower. Administration lawyers are studying whether the president has the authority to cancel debt through executive action, the official said.<br />Last month, the Education Department canceled $500 million in student debt owed by thousands of former students of the defunct ITT Technical Institute, which federal regulators have accused of financial mismanagement and deceptive recruiting tactics. The department has said it would move later this year to tweak federal rules to allow more aggrieved borrowers who attended other for-profit schools to have their debt forgiven.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump says fraud is the only reason he lost the 2020 election. Some even think Mr. Trump will be reinstated once the truth comes out. Anyone who finds this narrative at all appealing should take 30 minutes to read the investigative report posted last week by Michigan Republicans. It’s only 35 pages.<br />The report is from the GOP state Senate’s Oversight Committee, which synthesized testimony from about 90 people, plus thousands of pages of subpoenaed documents. The committee’s chair, Ed McBroom, was a Trump delegate at the 2016 GOP national convention, and in 2019 he was a guest at the White House, looking on while Mr. Trump signed an executive order.<br />While the report identifies “clear weaknesses in our elections system that require legislative remedy,” it is unsparing about misinformation and innuendo. As Democrats regained power after the 2016 election, Mr. McBroom writes, “they were quick to utilize all of it to spend two years chasing every conspiracy and specious allegation.” He adds: “I pray my own party will not repeat this mistake for the next four years.”<br />The committee investigated 200 alleged dead voters. Only two problems were found. One was “a clerical error” involving a father and son with the same name. The other was an absentee ballot submitted by a 92-year-old, who then died four days before the election. That bad ballot should not have slipped through, though the report says 3,500 similar votes were caught.<br />Detroit’s counting center received deliveries of ballots at 3:30 a.m. and 4:30 a.m., but the inquiry found no evidence of fraud. A purportedly suspicious picture “was a photo of a WXYZ-TV photographer hauling his equipment.” Also, look at the numbers: Voter turnout in Wayne County (Detroit) was up only 11.4% last year, compared with 15.4% in the rest of Michigan, which hardly sounds like a dump of fake ballots. President Trump received a higher share of Wayne County’s vote in 2020 than in 2016.</td>

      <td>Teachers unions dominate in Washington these days, but reform expands in four more states.</td>
      <td>It’s been a banner year for school choice in the states, and legislatures aren’t finished expanding scholarship and education savings account programs (ESAs). In four state budgets that passed in the last two weeks, lawmakers included provisions that give families more educational opportunities.<br />In New Hampshire last week, Republican lawmakers approved Education Freedom Accounts, which students can use toward such expenses as private school tuition, tutoring, textbooks and technology. Scholarship funds are available to families earning up to 300% of the federal poverty line at an average of $4,600, the state per-pupil funding amount for public school students. The state Education Department estimates the program could save the state at least $360 million over a decade.<br />On Wednesday Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf signed a budget that includes an expansion of a high-demand state tax-credit scholarship program. The GOP Legislature pushed the measure, but Mr. Wolf will now share the political credit. The Educational Improvement Tax Credit cap will rise by $40 million to $175 million for K-12 scholarships, enough to fund an estimated 13,000 more students. The expansion “shows that the commonwealth is placing the focus on children, not on any one educational model,” said state Sen. Scott Martin.<br />Ohio lawmakers packaged several school-choice provisions into their budget that Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed Wednesday. These include funding for high-performing charter schools and higher scholarship values for the state’s voucher program. The Legislature also created a new K-12 ESA program, which offers students a modest $500.<br />In Arizona the Legislature raised the funding cap for a special-needs tax-credit scholarship program and allowed low-income students at struggling public schools to switch to the state’s ESA program without a waiting period. The shame is that lawmakers, including three Republicans, rejected an expansion of ESAs to 600,000 more low-income students.</td>

      <td>Years of investigation and prosecutors come up with a small tax case.</td>
      <td>Democrats of all stripes have devoted years to investigating Donald Trump and finding very little. The latest example is Thursday’s indictment of the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer for classifying employee benefits as business expenses rather than compensation.<br />Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr. and New York Attorney General Letitia James subpoenaed millions of documents and years of tax returns, and that’s all they’ve come up with. The indictment lists 15 criminal counts, including second degree grand larceny. But the evidence in the indictment boils down to misreporting compensation to the Internal Revenue Service and New York tax authorities.<br />Prosecutors allege that Allen Weisselberg, the 73-year-old accountant and CFO, received as much as $1.76 million in compensation over a 16-year-period—for cars, an apartment rental, and tuition for Mr. Weisselberg’s grandchildren at a private school—in a way that kept them off the books for tax purposes. The indictment says he avoided paying $901,112 he owed in taxes and collected federal and state tax refunds of $133,124 he wasn’t entitled to.<br />If true and willful, this is rotten behavior. But it isn’t Teapot Dome, and disguising compensation as expenses is far from unusual in corporate America. It’s typically handled as a civil matter and settled with the payment of back taxes, interest and fines. It is rarely the basis for a criminal indictment.<br />The prosecutors are throwing the book at Mr. Weisselberg to get him to turn state’s evidence against the former President. The same goes for the highly unusual decision to indict the Trump Organization, which is presumably intended to squeeze its business prospects. Notably, neither Mr. Trump nor his children who run the business were charged.</td>

      <td>As politicians like to do, President Biden is taking credit for the 850,000 net new jobs that the Labor Department said Friday were added in June. “None of this happened by accident,” he said. “It’s a direct result of the American Rescue Plan.”<br />He’s right it’s not an accident. It’s the result of the economy reopening in more states, but the jobs recovery would be faster without the $1.9 trillion spending bill Democrats passed this spring.<br />The top-line number beat most estimates with private employers adding 662,000 jobs. A big bump was to be expected after states lifted almost all of their business restrictions. Vaccines last month were widely available, and people exhausted by lockdowns have been eager to go out. Reservations on OpenTable in many states are higher than the same time in 2019.<br />Most jobs added last month were in industries that reopened, especially leisure and hospitality (343,000), state and local education (229,700) and retail (67,100). The household survey was more pessimistic and showed unemployment increased by 168,000, which caused the jobless rate to tick up to 5.9% from 5.8%.<br />While the household and establishment surveys don’t always match, last month’s disparity appears to be due in part to the huge increase in part-time work (408,000) and decline in reported self-employment (183,000). These differences tend to re-align over time.</td>

But that decision was partly reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 2019 and settled for $13 million on Jan. 14, he said.</td>

      <td>The decision invalidates a Trump administration plan intended to be a big compromise between farmers and refiners</td>
      <td>A federal appeals court Friday struck down a 2019 rule-change to expand summertime ethanol sales, saying the Trump administration overreached its authority when it lifted a ban on gasoline with a higher ethanol content.<br />The decision is a loss for corn farmers who have come to rely on ethanol sales for a large part of their revenue. They had aggressively lobbied President Trump to have the Environmental Protection Agency allow for a summertime expansion of the fuel in 2019, in part because it was one of the few options for growing ethanol sales.<br />Friday’s ruling may leave the ethanol lobby with little to show from four years of advocacy from Mr. Trump. It fully throws out a deal that the Trump administration had framed as its compromise between refiners and farmers, two big Republican allies that have long fought over federal mandates for adding corn-based, or “renewable fuel,” to gasoline. And the ruling is the second federal-court decision in roughly a week to undo an Trump EPA effort that intended to boost ethanol sales.<br />In that first decision, issued June 25, the Supreme Court had allowed small petroleum refineries to obtain exemptions. Iowa farmers had appealed directly to Mr. Trump to more closely limit those exemptions, making it central to his reelection campaign in a swing state.<br />Friday’s decision came from a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which said the EPA had improperly reinterpreted legal language in the Clean Air Act long understood as limiting ethanol to 10% of the content of gasoline during four summer months. Once the court undid that decision, it said the rest of the rule was moot, overturning other parts of the package intended to help refiners as well.</td>

      <td>When settlement talks begin, you can expect Mr. Trump’s political pull to be on the table too.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump looked crestfallen amid his victory on election night 2016. As I duly related some weeks later, sociologist Anne Nassauer, applying well-established metrics, told me: “We can only speculate as to why President-elect Trump showed facial expressions of sadness. It is surprising that he showed these expressions directly after his victory in the election.”<br />Speculating wasn’t hard. This week is why. Mr. Trump, who is not the fool some imagine, knew winning the presidency was a dangerous mishap from a personal legal standpoint. Mr. Trump, until then, mainly tussled with sharpies who wanted only some of his money, not his destruction. He also knew that in our overgrown regulatory state, prosecutors can find something on anybody, even those who conduct their affairs with a scrupulousness foreign to Mr. Trump.<br />It’s “political,” Mr. Trump says of this week’s charges. Yes, inevitably and partly. That’s why people with Mr. Trump’s deep pockets and checkered history are unwise to go into politics, however much it might benefit the nation to have a broadly welcoming presidential talent pool.<br />The charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and New York Attorney General Letitia James are over the top for what amount to tax violations related to employee compensation. Larceny? Who stole what from whom? Mr. Trump’s company and its major-domo, Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg—though not Mr. Trump himself so far—are accused of doling out perks as normal business expenses, thereby avoiding  personal income and payroll taxes.<br />Mr. Trump’s lawyer said, probably accurately, that such complaints usually are settled as a civil matter with the Internal Revenue Service for the reasons alluded to above. The IRS cares mainly about getting maximum money at least cost for its enforcement efforts. Not so elected officials such as Mr. Vance and Ms. James. If the prosecution is a giant net loser financially for the state of New York, that’s fine with them.</td>

      <td>When you talk, it’s hard for anyone to interrupt. And a face staring back on screen is hard to ignore.</td>
      <td>After 14 months working from home, I have mastered the art of digital collaboration. What began as a clumsy series of video chats from my kitchen counter—plagued by technological difficulties and unfamiliarity—quickly became the most efficient and effective way to connect with colleagues and clients across the globe. I am proficient in BlueJeans, Teams, Webex, Meet, Chime and 8X8, but I have a black belt in Zoom, my preferred videoconferencing tool. I personalize my background, admit participants, put up my hand, pull up presentations, and mute and unmute myself as needed.<br />The efficiency and flexibility of videoconferencing is dominating discussions about the return to the office. As I think about a post-pandemic world, I am faced with the inevitable pivot back to in-person meetings, day-to-day interactions and the choices that must now be made: Is this a phone call, an email, a Zoom, a lunch, a coffee or a meeting?<br />Suddenly possibilities are opening up for more-tailored interactions and better time management. Some meetings are best conducted in person. But for investment bankers, a return to meetings may also mean a return to old practices and protocols that have tended to keep women in a corner of the room.<br />Zoom is the great equalizer. Everyone’s box is the same size. It doesn’t matter if you are the CEO or the summer intern, your real estate is the same. A box with a name but no title became a tool of empowerment. Your name and face are consistently visible, making you more memorable, familiar and known. When you speak it is very hard for anyone to interrupt and it is also very hard to be ignored with your face staring back. You get invited to a lot of meetings that you wouldn’t have attended if travel were involved. I have witnessed many women in investment banking, young women in particular, find their voices and project newfound confidence in this virtual square. Remember, this is an industry still dominated by men and the physical manifestations of assertiveness and power.<br />Over the course of my career I have pushed and shoved my way to the head of the conference table. Like many other women, for a long time I would choose a seat at the back of the room. I remember the gestures at me to move out of the way so others could get down to business. I remember what it was like at the far end of the table, so far from the client I had to flick my business card down the table in a desperate attempt to be acknowledged. Many times my business card remained stranded in the middle of the table at the conclusion of the meeting. Often these habits follow women as they climb the ranks.</td>

Some of the historical dynamics of the oil markets have been thrown upside down by the pandemic.<br />Demand growth from the developed world, which for years has stagnated, is on a tear as it emerges furiously from Covid-19 lockdowns. Meanwhile, the developing world—the source of almost all new oil demand in years past—is still sputtering.<br />A week ago, OPEC and allied producers led by Russia were leaning toward boosting production by half a million barrels a day, with more additions possible later in the year, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />Going into formal deliberations being held virtually this week, Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, and Russia had agreed to take up a proposal that includes a boost of about half a million barrels a day starting in August, according to people familiar with the talks, and then gradually increasing OPEC+ output by a total two million barrels through December.</td>
