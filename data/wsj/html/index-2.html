      <td>The Justice Department charged three people at a contractor for the U.S. Navy in Japan with fraud involving the alleged dumping of waste from U.S. warships for more than a decade.<br />Sojiro Imahashi, president and chief executive of Kanto Kosan Co., as well as company managers Tsuyoshi Ifuku and Yuki Yamamiya allegedly conspired to bill the Navy under contracts to treat wastewater from U.S. ships from 2007 to 2020 but instead dumped contaminated water into Japanese harbors, according to the indictment.<br />“The defendants deceived the U.S. Navy by willfully failing to satisfy the company’s obligations under $120 million in contracts,” said acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid. He said the contracts called for compliance with environmental safeguards.<br />When The Wall Street Journal reported on the investigation into suspected dumping in 2019, Kanto Kosan denied any wrongdoing. Reached on Thursday after the indictment, Mr. Yamamiya, Kanto Kosan’s general manager, said: “We’re puzzled and currently consulting with our lawyer about what action to take. For now, we can’t make any further comment.”<br />A spokeswoman for the Seventh Fleet said Kanto Kosan continues to provide wastewater treatment for the Navy in Japan. Kanto Kosan services U.S. Navy vessels in the Seventh Fleet’s home port of Yokosuka, on the south edge of Tokyo Bay; at Sasebo, in western Japan; and on the island of Okinawa, in the far south.</td>

The officials said Mr. Biden and senior White House advisers have been briefed on the planning.<br />Anita Dunn, a White House senior adviser and top campaign aide, said the nonprofit will work with existing advocacy organizations to try to build coalitions of support.<br />“This is not to replicate. It is not to duplicate,” Ms. Dunn said, but will work with those existing groups.</td>

      <td>An electricity grid that relies on renewables also needs nuclear or coal power.</td>
      <td>While millions of Texans remain without power for a third day, the wind industry and its advocates are spinning a fable that gas, coal and nuclear plants—not their frozen turbines—are to blame. PolitiFact proclaims “Natural gas, not wind turbines, main driver of Texas power shortage.” Climate-change conformity is hard for the media to resist, but we don’t mind. So here are the facts to cut through the spin.<br />Texas energy regulators were already warning of rolling blackouts late last week as temperatures in western Texas plunged into the 20s, causing wind turbines to freeze. Natural gas and coal-fired plants ramped up to cover the wind power shortfall as demand for electricity increased with falling temperatures.<br />Some readers have questioned our reporting Wednesday ("The Political Making of a Texas Power Outage") that wind’s share of electricity generation in Texas plunged to 8% from 42%. How can that be, they wonder, when the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot) has reported that it counts on wind to meet only 10% of its winter capacity.<br />Ercot’s disclosure is slippery. Start with the term “capacity,” which means potential maximum output. This is different than actual power generation. Texas has a total winter capacity of about 83 megawatts (MW) including all power sources. Total power demand and generation, however, at their peak are usually only around 57 MW. Regulators build slack into the system.<br />Texas has about 30,000 MW of wind capacity, but winds aren’t constant or predictable. Winds this past month have generated between about 600 and 22,500 MW. Regulators don’t count on wind to provide much more than 10% or so of the grid’s total capacity since they can’t command turbines to increase power like they can coal and gas plants.</td>

      <td>Oil’s recent rise above $60 a barrel will test the willpower of shale companies that pledged to slow drilling and repair balance sheets battered by the pandemic.<br />The highest prices since January 2020 have given U.S. drillers an unexpected opening to invest in oil patches considered unworkable just a few months ago. Some, such as  Devon Energy Corp. , have begun to loosen the purse strings as the market improves.<br />For now, though, many frackers are unable to take advantage of the rally as they work to restore as much as roughly one-third of the nation’s oil production. The winter storm that left millions without power this week knocked out as much as 2.5 million barrels a day in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford of Texas and one million in other oil-rich states, traders estimated.<br />Icy roads have blocked service crews from reaching wells, and analysts estimated the disruptions could affect production through March. It will take weeks to determine exactly how many barrels will have been lost to the storm, Devon Chief Executive Richard Muncrief said.<br />In earnings calls this week, shale executives said they are sticking to capital discipline, which has become a mantra of the industry following a yearslong push by investors.</td>

      <td>Classical Western values such as free speech and tolerance need all the defenders they can find these days, so kudos to French President Emmanuel Macron for volunteering for the mission. It’s hardly an easy task, but it’s an important one. Mr. Macron is right to conclude it’s vital to France’s future—and we'd add, to America’s.<br />Mr. Macron and ministers in his government in recent months have been fighting illiberal and divisive philosophies they say emanate from American universities. Mr. Macron in October decried the influence of “certain social-science theories entirely imported from the United States.”<br />He means in particular the habit of viewing most matters in racial terms—a core tenet of “wokeness”—and his government wants educational institutions to eschew it. Minister for Higher Education Frédérique Vidal this week promised an investigation into academics “looking at everything through the prism of wanting to fracture and divide.”<br />This is part of a broader drive to reassert French values after many years of Islamist terror attacks. Mr. Macron also is pushing for a new crackdown on religious extremism, and his law to that end passed through one chamber of the National Assembly this week.<br />Mr. Macron’s political and philosophical insight is to tie together the fight against violent extremism from outside France and the defense of democratic values within. His October speech detailing his new plan for combating Islamism included a warning that a focus on “post-colonial or anti-colonial” discourse constitutes a form of “self-hatred” of France that allows Islamism to flourish. Officials such as Ms. Vidal also warn against “Islamo-leftism.”</td>

      <td>Democrat are selling a $1.9 trillion spending bill as a Covid relief measure, but buried in the fine print are policy choices far removed from the pandemic, such as a $22 billion tax increase on multinational companies.<br />Daniel Bunn, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, has the details. When a U.S. company with foreign subsidiaries does its taxes, it attributes some of its interest expense to its overseas income. But that allocation might not reflect reality if the divisions abroad also take out their own debt.<br />“This could get to the point,” Mr. Bunn wrote last week, “that the company’s foreign tax credits do not accurately reflect taxes paid, resulting in double taxation.”<br />In 2004 Congress passed a law, which took effect this year, that allows interest allocations on a “worldwide basis,” meaning they might even flow from the subsidiary to the parent company, “depending on the level of expenses and where income is earned,” Mr. Bunn writes. “This allows better alignment of expenses and income for the purpose of calculating foreign tax credits.” The House version of the latest Covid-19 relief bill would permanently eliminate this provision.<br />Taxation of multinationals is complex, and the point here isn’t to defend every jot and tittle of the current internal revenue code. But this tweak is a tax increase, period. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will raise $22.3 billion in revenue through 2031. That’s also why this improvement to the tax code that passed Congress in 2004, the year  Facebook  was founded and before the iPhone existed, spent a decade and a half in limbo: It was repeatedly delayed by lawmakers scrounging for cash.</td>

After a seven-month, 292-million-mile journey, NASA’s biggest, fastest and brainiest rover ever—Perseverance—is nearing its highly anticipated touchdown on the Red Planet.<br />The $2.7 billion rover, which is scheduled to land at 3:55 p.m. EST on Thursday, embodies the latest and most ambitious effort by NASA to find evidence of past life on Mars. Though it is now a barren place of icy dunes, dust devils, dead volcanoes and subzero winds, scientists believe Mars in its remote past may have been a comparatively lush, warm world—one suitable for the chemistry of life.<br />“It will attempt to answer an age-old question that has eluded humanity for generations: whether life has ever existed elsewhere beyond our own planet,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the space agency’s science mission directorate in Washington, said of the Perseverance mission.<br />Bristling with sensors, cameras, microphones and a robotic arm, the one-ton, SUV-size Perseverance rover is designed to look for rock or soil specimens that might harbor evidence of ancient life and pack what it finds into small tubes, to be cached for retrieval by future missions and brought back to Earth for analysis. NASA and the European Space Agency are discussing several mission scenarios that might return these samples by 2031, NASA officials said.<br />During its two-year mission, Perseverance will roam the surface and look for traces of organic matter, which could be evidence of primordial microbes or other simple life-forms. Other places in the solar system—from the searing clouds of Venus to the frozen oceans of moons around Jupiter and Saturn—might also have the potential for life. But those places are considered even more inaccessible than Mars.</td>

The details, including overall costs, haven’t yet been set. It comes as his team is pressing lawmakers to win approval for his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal in Congress.<br />Mr. Biden, joined by union leaders in the Oval Office, told reporters that the nation is “so far behind the curve,” on rebuilding its roads and bridges. He said the country lagged far behind foreign countries “in terms of infrastructure, everything from canals to highways to airports, to everything we can do and we need to do to make ourselves competitive in the 21st century.”<br />Union leaders meeting with Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris included AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, and Mark McManus, general president of the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters.<br />Mr. Biden noted that many of the attendees were longtime friends—“as they say in parts of my state, these are the folks that brung me to the dance”—and the meeting capped a number of actions to appeal to his labor allies.</td>

      <td>Some economists warn about too much spending, but too little could hurt the economy more.</td>
      <td>A big tempest is brewing in a big teapot over President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan. Republican objections are to be expected. But some of the objections come from nominally Democratic economists, led by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. This is a surprise.<br />The Biden plan isn’t perfect. But with today’s enormous uncertainties, no one can possibly know what the “right” plan really is.<br />Here’s an analogy. I recently listened to a wonderful scientific seminar. At one point, a scientist who was obviously very knowledgeable about vaccines asked a scientist from the pharmaceutical industry how researchers had decided on the dosage in each shot (which struck him as large) and the interval between the first and second shots (which struck him as short).<br />I’ll paraphrase the answer: We were in the middle of a pandemic. We didn’t want to take any chances of underdosing people, and we wanted to get vaccines into people’s arms fast. That response both acknowledged the huge scientific uncertainties and displayed a keen sense of how asymmetric the risks were. Underdosing and waiting too long between shots meant more sickness and death. Overdosing and giving second shots at shorter intervals did not.<br />That is not unlike designing an economic relief program. No one knows either the exactly correct dosage or the precisely correct timing. Only history will judge whether the program was too small or too big—and even then with much guesswork. But the risks in each direction are not symmetric.</td>

But in defining America's future national strategy, the new administration should take this process a step further.<br />China’s long-term strategy stretches beyond the issues of trade policy, great power rivalry, nuclear proliferation and military expansion. Largely unexamined in the public debate is China’s pursuit of massive infrastructure projects in developing countries, where it seeks to cement long-term relations. These economic and diplomatic ties are an extension of power—with China’s military and security involvement justified as necessary to protect its interests.<br />China seeks to be the world’s most powerful country, and its Belt and Road Initiative is an important component of its strategy. As a safeguard to our diplomatic and economic health the U.S. should recalibrate its own approach to often ignored nations, even as we continue to meet the more traditional national security challenges that dominate the headlines.<br />Much of the world is becoming uneasy with China’s unremitting aggression on its home turf in Asia. Over the past decade China has been calling its own shots, rejecting international law and public opinion while signaling that it intends to replace the U.S. as the region’s dominant military, diplomatic and economic power. Beijing has taken down Hong Kong’s democracy movement; started military spats with India; disrupted life for tens of millions by damming the headwaters of the Mekong River; conducted what the U.S. government now deems a campaign of genocide against Muslim Uighurs; escalated tensions with Japan over the Senkaku Islands; consolidated its illegal occupation of islands in the South China Sea; and made repeated bellicose gestures designed to test the international community’s resistance to “unifying” the “renegade province” of Taiwan.<br />While any of these and similar moves could expand into major crises, they already have raised suspicions across the international community. The BRI has to date remained a separate matter, but the cumulative effect of Beijing’s relentless provocations has given pause to many of China’s third-world partners in economic development.</td>

Perhaps unsurprisingly, we became fast friends. He’s earned the nickname “Sunshine” among my friend group for his positive disposition and, like the character in “Remember the Titans,” his wholesome good looks.<br />Our shared interests came up again last month as Sunshine and I chatted while running together. I admitted that while my love of Jerry and Bob hadn’t waned, I had fallen out of the habit of saying the prayer that once brought me such calm. “Funny,” he said. “It was your sticker that first challenged me to up my game.” We jogged on in silence, and I didn’t think much more of the exchange.<br />Two weeks later, Sunshine found me in the narthex of our church right before Sunday Mass. There he pressed into my palm a handmade set of rosary beads he’d ordered for me. I was surprised because I hadn’t asked for them; not verbally, anyway. It was just his way of doing me a good turn.</td>

In his introduction Mr. Ford, a Stanford law professor and cultural critic, writes that he learned his sense of style from his father, a trained tailor and an ordained minister. “For years my dad endured my sartorial misadventures (asymmetrical ‘new-wave’ haircuts, nylon parachute pants, the ‘punk’ look, which consisted of deliberately torn garments held together with safety pins or duct tape) in quiet despair.” In the end the author followed his father’s example and came to appreciate the virtues of tailored suits, polished dress shoes and crisp shirts. So much so that in 2009 he decided to enter Esquire magazine’s Best Dressed Real Man contest.<br />Among the book’s illustrations is a snapshot of the author in a smart pinstripe suit, his arms around his squirming daughter. It helped Mr. Ford gain sixth place in the contest, but he blew the interview. “I knew intuitively why I wore what I did, but I could not explain it to save my life.”<br />“Dress Codes” is his belated but eloquent response. In a jam-packed, fact-filled survey, Mr. Ford skillfully examines how fashion, far from being mere frivolity, has shaped people’s lives from the 14th century to the present. His wide-ranging research is punctuated with quotations from such cultural observers as the semiotician Roland Barthes, designer Miuccia Prada (who like Barthes saw fashion as “a wearable language”), historian Anne Hollander and economist Thorstein Veblen.<br />Joan of Arc was one of history’s first fashion victims, burned at the stake for heresy. Among her crimes: the wearing of men’s clothes. In some 15th-century Italian cities, Christian women were forbidden to wear earrings (symbols of sin), while for Jewish women it was compulsory. During the Renaissance, sumptuous attire—furs, velvet, silks—was a way of asserting social dominance, and sumptuary laws kept upstarts in their place.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal agents have seized approximately 10 million counterfeit N95 face masks bearing the  3M Co.  logo in recent weeks, officials said Wednesday, as they urged thousands of hospitals and medical facilities to stop using suspected fakes.<br />The Department of Homeland Security said the counterfeit masks were made in China. The most recent interdiction occurred Wednesday, with the seizure of hundreds of thousands of masks from an East Coast warehouse at an undisclosed location.<br />Acting on leads from 3M, DHS officials said they have seized counterfeit items in five states and have opened criminal investigations.<br />“They are extremely dangerous,” Steve Francis, director of the Intellectual Property Center for DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations unit said at a news conference. “They are providing a false sense of security to our first-line responders and to the American consumers.”<br />Officials said grammatical errors or typos on packaging or user instructions are telltale signs of counterfeit items. They said they have contacted about 6,000 hospitals, clinics and others who may have purchased counterfeit masks, urging them to stop using the masks and contact DHS immediately.</td>

His interview in February with federal agents suggests the probe into Ms. Holmes remains active ahead of her July trial.<br />The U.S. attorney’s office in the Northern District of California accuses Ms. Holmes and Theranos’s former chief operating officer, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, of misleading investors and patients about the company’s technology, which purported to test for a range of health conditions with a single finger prick and a few drops of blood. The two have pleaded not guilty to criminal fraud, with Mr. Balwani set to face trial separately next January.<br />During an hourlong Feb. 1 interview recounted in a Tuesday court filing, Dr. Das told federal agents about his work with Theranos from December 2015 until he was laid off in June 2018, months before the company dissolved. By the time he became director of the startup’s Newark, Calif., lab, the facility was under scrutiny by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.<br />Theranos was also facing public pressure after The Wall Street Journal revealed in late 2015 that the company ran few tests on its proprietary machines, which produced unreliable results, and instead performed most tests with commercial analyzers that it bought from other companies and sometimes altered.</td>

Ahead of the storm, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued a state of emergency, which will allow for quicker repairs to downed lines and other utility issues.<br />“This forecast for icy weather is a real threat for widespread power outages,” the Democrat said Wednesday. “People need to be ready to stay home and be prepared to lose power for a while.”</td>

      <td>If any media folk are still interested in “fact-checking” presidents after the Trump era, they’ll have plenty of fodder from Tuesday night’s appearance by President Joe Biden on CNN. A favorite Biden habit is to appeal to the authority of economists, many of whom remain unnamed, to suggest that his policies are wildly popular among experts. And what would we do without anonymous experts?<br />Newsweek has a transcript of the event in which CNN’s Anderson Cooper hosted our 46th president at Milwaukee’s Pabst Theater. Here’s an excerpt:<br />Thank goodness this statement is not accurate. There is not an “overwhelming consensus” among economists that no amount of federal spending is excessive. This column is often skeptical of conventional expert opinion. But even for those who aren’t, the Biden economic plan is notable for the way it has drawn criticism not just from economists in the center and on the right but from Mr. Biden’s own former colleagues on the left. Many of the critiques specifically warn that he is indeed spending too much taxpayer money on a recovering economy which does not need another massive intervention.<br />Last month this column noted the criticism of Bidenomics from veterans of the Obama economic team. More recently one of the Biden plan’s enthusiastic backers also acknowledged the resistance coming from liberal economists. John Cassidy wrote in the New Yorker:<br />One can usually count on massive federal programs to be counterproductive, such as the one Mr. Biden helped oversee as Vice President in 2009 and which he reasonably described on Tuesday as “the last experiment we had with stimulus.” Unreasonably for taxpayers, the experiment failed as the plan burned through more than $800 billion and failed miserably to reach its employment goals.</td>

Mr. Kim also has said the Cuomo administration was engaged in a coverup related to nursing-home deaths.<br />“He attacked me and said that I obstructed justice in a letter today,” Mr. Cuomo said of Mr. Kim. “He said today that the immunity bill was because of my political contributors. Those are very harsh accusations.”<br />“If you don’t correct the disinformation, it perpetuates,” Mr. Cuomo added.<br />The governor has come under fire from Democratic and Republican leaders following the disclosure that his administration didn’t fully release information regarding Covid-19 deaths in the state’s nursing homes out of its fear that former President Trump’s administration would politicize the information. That concern prompted the Cuomo administration to withhold information from state lawmakers regarding how many nursing-home residents died from the virus after they were transferred to hospitals, citing the continuing probe by the U.S. Department of Justice.</td>

And vaccinating an entire town will counter Brazil’s growing anti-vax movement and demonstrate the wider benefits of mass immunization, such as a quick economic recovery expected with a fast reopening of Serrana.<br />“It will give us information about the percentage of people who need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity—no one knows this yet,” said Marcos Borges, a professor of medicine at the University of São Paulo in nearby Ribeirão Preto who is leading the study.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats are bracing for an internal battle over raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, as they grappled with the political and procedural constraints on reaching a long-held goal of the party’s progressive wing.<br />Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan proposes to do by 2025, faces opposition from some Democratic lawmakers and parliamentary hurdles. Democrats cannot afford to lose a single vote in the 50-50 Senate on the relief package, which also calls for sending many Americans a $1,400 direct check, bolstering federal unemployment aid, and offering funds for vaccine distribution and testing.<br />At a CNN town hall event on Tuesday, Mr. Biden floated the possibility of raising the minimum wage to $12 or $13 an hour by 2025, rather than $15.  “I do support a $15 minimum wage,” Mr. Biden said. “But that’s a debatable issue.”<br />Press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday Mr. Biden continues to back the $15 wage but noted his aid proposal “included many other components.” She added that the legislation “may not look the same way when it comes out of the sausage-making machine” in Congress.<br />While many Republicans have assailed the proposed wage increase, arguing that it would hurt small businesses and cost jobs, Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Tuesday they would soon introduce their own legislation to raise the minimum wage. The two Republicans said they would pair the gradual wage increase with a requirement that employers verify the immigration status of their employees—likely a nonstarter with Democrats. The pair haven’t yet specified what level they would raise the wage.</td>

      <td>A familiar voice in American media and politics has gone quiet. Rush Limbaugh, the most listened-to radio host in America for 30 years, died Wednesday at age 70.<br />We recall how bracing the Rush Limbaugh Show was in its early days. For decades the airwaves had been governed by the Fairness Doctrine, a federal regulation requiring stations to balance “controversial” claims with “contrasting viewpoints.” The rule gave incumbent candidates and mainstream news outlets a near-monopoly on public discourse. Ronald Reagan scrapped the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. By the 1992 presidential campaign, the radio star’s first name was known across the U.S.<br />Limbaugh, whose show ran on weekdays from noon to 3 p.m. East Coast time, was invaluable to the conservative movement in the 1990s. He would spend an hour explaining supply-side tax policy or making the case for deregulation. Millions of Americans had never heard a coherent argument against the welfare state or Roe v. Wade until they tuned in to Limbaugh’s show. He played an enormous role in popularizing conservative ideas and policies.<br />His critics called him a racist and about everything else, which was always unfair. His real offense was to gain millions of weekly listeners by mocking the left’s pieties. He dissected environmental scare campaigns, and he ridiculed the news media for finding epidemics of homelessness only during Republican administrations. In 1994 Bill Clinton called the show from Air Force One to complain about the host’s criticisms—not for the last time blaming scrappy radio hosts for his own political woes.<br />In recent years, with the rise of more acerbic competitors and a general souring of public discourse, Limbaugh took on a more exasperated tone. He also moved to the Trumpian right on issues such as trade, immigration and foreign policy.</td>

The directors’ departure could be announced as soon as Wednesday, this person said.<br />Mr. Collins, former chief executive of medical device-maker  Medtronic PLC ,  has been a Boeing board member since 2007. Ms. Schwab, a former U.S. trade representative, has been on the board since 2010.<br />The departures have been under consideration in recent weeks and are part of a longer-term push to bring new directors onto the board in the aftermath of the MAX crisis, some of the people familiar with the matter said. Four members of the expected 10-member board will have been added after the accidents.<br />Boeing’s board has faced scrutiny from investors and U.S. lawmakers ever since two of its 737 MAX jets crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, claiming 346 lives. A year ago, the board added two new directors with safety and engineering experience as two longtime members stepped down. Since the accidents, Boeing’s board has also added a permanent safety committee and split the roles of chairman and chief executive.</td>

      <td>Jackson Hole and other popular ski resorts in the West are up and running with varying Covid rules and limitations. For purists, that’s not such a bad thing.</td>
      <td>ON A RECENT Wednesday at noon, I stood in the middle of Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, peering over my skis at the run below us. At big resorts that time of day, every last new snowflake has usually been flattened by legions of skiers streaming off the lifts. But the trail below me, which dropped away at a perfect pitch between pine trees and cliffs, looked strangely pristine. It was clear that only a few people had skied here that morning.<br />Though my boyfriend, Andrew, and I, both zealous skiers, live just a few miles from Jackson Hole, with the Covid-19 pandemic still raging, we’d avoided the major commercial ski areas this winter in favor of the wide-open spaces of backcountry and Nordic skiing. But we were curious to see how the big ski resorts were managing the crowds a few months in and how the crowds were managing all the new Covid precautions. As we approached Jackson Hole that morning, our first impression wasn’t favorable: A line of cars with plates from Texas to Massachusetts crawled along the entrance road, waiting to enter the parking lot. Barely past 9 a.m., even on a weekday, all lots were close to full, usually indicating miserably long lift lines.<br />Next up was a five-minute bus ride in a shuttle designed to accommodate 45 people but limited to a maximum of 25. Plastered everywhere inside were signs requiring skiers to wear masks and our fellow passengers respected the dictate, save one man who stonily ignored a request from another skier to pull up his mask.<br />At the ticket office, we quickly picked up the prepaid passes we’d ordered online. But our hearts sank at the sight of the lift lines. The wait for the tram, limited to 25 riders instead of the normal 100, easily looked like a two-hour ordeal. We bypassed that crowd and trudged up a slight hill, bombarded by more signs and banners laying out resort-wide Covid rules and mask-required areas. Even though my mask was compromising my oxygen intake after the exertion and I longed to tear it off, the signs shamed me into lightheaded gasping instead.<br />The line at the next lift looked worryingly sardine can-like, but as we got closer, we saw that its snaking nature had made the widely spaced skiers appear more congested than they were. In the end, we only waited 15 minutes. Still, to minimize the time languishing on long lift-lines at the base, we headed to the upper mountain lifts, which had much shorter waits. To avoid dining indoors, we had picked up burritos from D.O.G. in town and tucked them into our pockets for lunch on the lift.</td>

See a recent profile of Daniel Kaluuya, an actor whose profile has risen through a string of noteworthy films, including “Judas and the Black Messiah” (now streaming on HBO Max).<br />Here’s what is streaming this week:<br />(HBO Max)<br />Aside from being a world-famous musician, Sir Elton John has devoted much of his advocacy work to the Elton John AIDS Foundation, which he founded in 1992. Here, he recommends ‘It’s a Sin,” a limited series that chronicles the early days of the epidemic in the U.K. All five episodes begin streaming Thursday on HBO Max. Edited from an interview.<br />“Russell T Davies, who has written so many wonderful things—from ‘Queer as Folk’ to ‘Doctor Who’—has written a new series called ‘It’s a Sin’ that’s set among a group of gay men in the early ‘80s and the start of the AIDS epidemic in Britain. I was wondering how they were going to do it and they did it more than brilliantly. It was so accurate. It was so moving.</td>

      <td>Attorneys for Michael and Peter Taylor, accused of helping auto titan Carlos Ghosn out of Japan, made the request in a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken</td>
      <td>Two Americans accused of helping former auto titan Carlos Ghosn escape from Japan have made a last-ditch appeal to the Biden administration to stop the pair from being extradited to Japan or to put new conditions on their extradition.<br />Attorneys for Michael L. Taylor and his son Peter M. Taylor sent a letter early this month to Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking for a delay of 30 to 60 days for the new administration to take a look at whether the pair should be extradited, according to a copy of the letter viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The State Department has the final say in extradition cases, which are considered diplomatic matters. The Trump-era State Department had cleared the Taylors’ extradition. The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday declined to take up the case, marking the end of any legal appeals.<br />If U.S. officials decide to proceed with the extradition, the Taylors’ lawyers asked the State Department to put conditions on the surrender, including that the nine months the Taylors served in a U.S. jail count towards any prison sentence they might receive in Japan. The letter also requests that the Taylors serve any Japanese prison sentence in the U.S. or a U.S. military detention facility in Japan.<br />The Taylors at minimum have requested a delay in extradition until at least Feb. 25, the day after they are scheduled to receive their second Covid-19 vaccine, according to Paul V. Kelly, one of their attorneys. There is a Covid-19 outbreak at the Norfolk County jail near Boston where the Taylors have been held since U.S. authorities arrested them in May at the request of Japanese officials.</td>

Rice University is a close second in the region for resources, at No. 7 nationally.<br />Resources account for 30% of a school’s overall score in the WSJ/THE rankings.  Forty percent of each school’s overall score comes from student outcomes, including measures of graduate salaries and debt burdens, 20% from how well it engages its students and 10% from its environment, a measure of its diversity. The resources score is based on how much a school spends per student on teaching, the ratio of students to faculty and the number of published scholarly research papers per faculty member.<br />In addition to Vanderbilt and Rice, three other Southern schools made the top 20 nationwide for academic resources: Johns Hopkins University at No. 11, Duke University at No. 14 and Emory University at No. 19.  All five of the Southern schools in the top 20 for resources are also in the top 25 nationally in the overall ranking, led by Duke University at No. 5 overall.<br />See the full list of top Southern schools for resources below.

      <td>Unusually cold Texas weather is both good and bad for oil refiners as margins get a boost, but some are unable to capitalize</td>
      <td>The massive oil-and-gas complex along the U.S. Gulf Coast is built with extreme weather in mind—just not this kind. Bitter cold and resulting blackouts have shut in more production and refining capacity than any recent hurricane, delivering a windfall for some companies with the right assets in the right place.<br />Oil prices usually fall when refiners shut down unexpectedly—they are, after all, the only customer—but both U.S. crude supply and demand are being pinched. The picture is more bullish for the fuels refiners churn out. More than 3 million barrels a day of crude oil production, or about 27% of the total, have been affected, according to Raymond James, while about 18% of refining capacity has been shut. Front-month gasoline futures hit their highest level since October 2018 on Wednesday.<br />The crack spread, the difference between gasoline prices and crude oil, was up 5.13%, according to Robert Yawger, energy futures analyst at Mizuho Securities. That means higher profits for refiners still up and running.<br />Independent refiners, so badly battered by the pandemic, have seen a bump. The biggest gainers include shares of  PBF Energy  and  CVR Energy ,  both up by about a fifth compared with a week ago. Around 82% of PBF Energy’s total refining capacity is outside the Gulf Coast area. Other refiners with mixed footprints, such as  HollyFrontier Corp.  and  Valero ,  also have seen gains.<br />It isn’t clear how long the windfall will last and what the net benefit will be. For those that had to shut off substantial Gulf Coast refining capacity, a longer shutdown could just erase temporary profits. Meanwhile, market forces are at work. Mr. Yawger notes that European buyers have been purchasing crude oil to refine and export it to the U.S. as fast as they can. U.S. gasoline imports rose 20% this week compared with a week earlier, according to S&P Global Platts.</td>

      <td>Thrifty, functional tickers by brands like Timex and Swatch have become highly desirable—and it’s not just because John Mayer collaborated with Casio</td>
      <td>ONE OF THE more seriously sought-after watches released last year was the $180  Casio  G-Shock Ref. 6900 digital ticker made in collaboration with the musician John Mayer and the watch blog Hodinkee. Hodinkee is the sort of site that attracts horological fanatics who could spend hours ravenously reading up on the idiosyncrasies of different Omega reissues or uber-rare Swiss-made watches about to hit the auction block. These wonks regularly lust after four- or even five-figure timepieces, yet the modest Mayer G-Shock seduced them. (Tellingly, Hodinkee followed it up with a $14,400 Swiss dive watch by Blancpain.) When the limited-edition G-Shocks were released in December, they sold out in under 15 minutes. Like a rare pair of Nikes, the watch is still being flipped on eBay for nearly thrice its price tag.<br />Its profile was certainly boosted by its association with Mr. Mayer, a Grammy-winning singer and self-proclaimed “watch guy.” But these days, when the whole world has gone casual, choosy watch collectors are also falling for standard G-Shocks and other robust, thrifty timepieces like a $100 rubber-strapped  Timex  or $125 minimalist, metal-banded Swatches. “Everybody needs a utility watch...they’re great for washing dishes or any kind of tasks that you may not want to bang up your Swiss- or German-made higher-end timepiece [undertaking],” said Jason Buccieri, 28, a watch aficionado in Carmel, N.Y., who works in art operations and owns three beefy-cased, water-resistant G-Shocks.<br />Clayton Roth, 42, the owner of a professional dog-running business in Rhode Island, views decidedly undainty watches like his resin-coated G-Shocks as an occupational necessity. “I use them to time the dog runs...and I need something that is going to be light and not get destroyed if I do fall or get it wet if it’s pouring rain,” he said. When he’s off the clock, he savors his premium tickers like a stainless-steel Rolex Explorer and a handmade automatic number from Los Angeles’s Weiss Watch Company.<br />For many, the pandemic year jumbled the distinction between timepieces for work and weekend, letting prudent and practical watches occupy more wrist real estate. Mike DiAntonio, 28, an academic adviser in Boston who’s been working from home for around 11 months, straps on his down-to-earth G-Shock for work Zoom calls even if he otherwise dresses professionally. The casual watch—along with his off-camera slippers—puts him at ease.<br />That these watches offer a warm hit of nostalgia also elevates their appeal. Mr. DiAntonio’s battery-operated timepieces conjure the water-resistant Freestyle Shark watches he wore surfing as a child in New Jersey—minus the cartoonish neon colors. Mr. Roth likes that his G-Shock DW-5900 is the same design John Goodman’s character “Walter” wears in 1998’s beloved film, “The Big Lebowski.” And Mr. Mayer’s G-Shock 6900 delivers a double dose of nostalgia: The basic model was first launched in 1995, and the new release’s color scheme was inspired by the Casiotone keyboard Mr. Mayer played as a child growing up in the 1980s.</td>

      <td>Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would greatly hurt the economy, and the young and underqualified will be the ones to suffer if this is enacted.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Reality Check for a $15 Minimum Wage” (Feb. 9): Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would greatly hurt the economy, and the young and underqualified will be the ones to suffer if this is enacted.<br />I have been employed by a nonprofit gymnastics association for the past five years (since I was 14). As a student instructor (until high-school graduation) I made $7.25 an hour. An organization like the one I work for employs mostly students ages 14-18. Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would result in a reduction of staff, so much so that the services we provide wouldn’t be able to adequately be performed, ultimately leading to the demise of the organization.<br />Many of the employment opportunities my college-student peers and I seek are part-time and require little to no experience. These opportunities will disappear if the minimum wage is increased to $15 per hour. With that in mind, it is likely that America will see a decrease in employment and increase in poverty among young adults and inexperienced workers.<br />For the sake of the small businesses and the young and inexperienced workers, the proposal of a $15 per hour minimum wage needs to be fought and ultimately rejected.<br />Leah Bookser</td>

      <td>In “The Weekend Interview with Richard Alba: ‘Majority Minority’ America? Don’t Bet on It” (Feb. 6) John J. Miller notes that I believe we should quit counting racial/ethnic statistics. Correct, except that my subject was only the decennial census. It has seven questions, two about race, occupying 40% of the form. No room for questions on income, citizenship, immigration, etc. Is it not reasonable to conclude that the government cares about race above other issues? This is not the message we want sent to the entire population, including groups angry that race statistics, writes the Census Bureau, provide “services of particular interest to certain racial and ethnic groups.” Nor is the decennial robust enough to keep up with the demographic transformation Mr. Alba documents.<br />Ending racial discrimination requires new policies based on new statistics. The American Community Survey (ACS) is the source. It is the bureau’s largest sample survey, collecting data on 3.5 million Americans each year, and asking a wide range of questions: health, place of birth, veteran status, internet use, etc. Areas with a few thousand people can be studied by combining five years. The ACS’s scope, frequency and granularity can understand discrimination in ways not possible with the decennial census, the target of my “quit counting race”statement. The nation needs the decennial for its constitutional responsibility, the basic count used to reapportion, and for its capacity to provide a denominator for a vast array of statistical agencies. For policies responding to the institutional racism still with us and to the assimilation now unfolding before us the nation needs measures designed for those conditions. This is beyond the reach of the decennial, but not the ACS.<br />Kenneth Prewitt<br />New York<br />Mr. Prewitt was Census Bureau director 1998-2001.</td>

The output rise won’t kick in until April, given the Saudis already have committed to stick to cuts through March.<br />The advisers cautioned the plans still could be reversed if circumstances change, and the Saudis’ intention hasn’t yet been communicated to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the people and OPEC delegates.<br />“We are in a much better place than we were a year ago, but I must warn, once again, against complacency,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the Saudi energy minister, said at a conference Wednesday. “The uncertainty is very high, and we have to be extremely cautious.”</td>

Consumer activists say the disparity potentially leaves homeowners underinsured where they thought they were covered.<br />Many homeowners will learn that policies are anything but standardized across the industry, said Daniel Schwarcz, a University of Minnesota Law School professor.<br />Policies are more varied than they were a decade or two ago, he said. While some differences might work to homeowners’ advantage, a substantial majority could hurt them. As one example, some policies cover the risk that a structure collapses due to the weight of ice or snow, whereas others don’t, he said. Some may cover food spoilage resulting from the loss of power, though others don’t.</td>

He was 70 years old.<br />Mr. Limbaugh told listeners he was undergoing treatment for advanced lung cancer in early 2020. He said later that year that the cancer was stage 4, terminal and progressing after months of several different treatment regimens. At the time he reiterated his intent to continue with his show, despite fatigue and other symptoms.<br />Ms. Rogers on Wednesday said Mr. Limbaugh had “proudly fought and defended conservative values in a way that no one else can. Rush often stood up and took arrows on his own because he knew it was the right thing to do.”<br />Beginning as a relatively unknown disc jockey at stations in Pennsylvania and Missouri, Mr. Limbaugh saw his star rise quickly after starting a talk show in 1984 in Sacramento, Calif., where he began espousing conservative political ideas during the Republican revolution of the Reagan era. In 1988 he began a new show at WABC-AM in New York that was syndicated nationally on AM and FM stations.<br />“The Rush Limbaugh Show,” marked by his signature brash and acerbic conservatism, was the most-listened-to radio talk show in the U.S., according to Nielsen Audio, reaching more than 20 million monthly listeners on more than 650 affiliates as of the end of 2020.</td>

Part monastery, part fortress, this eroded jumble of buildings and caves sits atop a promontory overlooking the silted gray waters of the Langchen Tsangpo, the “elephant river,” known in India as the Sutlej.<br />It rises to the east, near the sacred lake of Manasarovar, where a few years ago, my wife and I climbed stiffly out of a Land Cruiser to stretch our legs. It would be hard to overestimate the spiritual significance of this landscape. If there is, in T.S. Eliot’s phrase, “a still point of the turning world,” then this is it, a place profoundly sacred to Hindus and Buddhists alike. At the roadside was a vast billboard with an image of Xi Jinping and a slogan about fighting poverty.<br />We were three days into a high-altitude road trip, driving west from Lhasa, the mountains of the Himalaya unspooling to our left and ahead the desert hills of the rolling Tibetan plateau. At the wheel was Migmar, with his bouffant quiff and navy pea coat. He grinned for a selfie in front of the sacred peak of Kailas and we carried on.<br />Over the next pass the elephant river cut deep into a region of softer rock, creating a gorge half a mile deep. Migmar pulled into a parking lot to take in the view. Overlooking the valley, the local tourist office had put up an information board with inscriptions in Chinese, Tibetan and English. Travelers were instructed to admire the ‘stratums of earth forest’ with their ‘surrounding sonwy [sic] mountains that embodies the giant verve of land.’ There’s no shortage of land verve in the Himalaya.<br />Soon after, Migmar turned left off the main highway on a newly laid road so perfect I wish I’d brought my bicycle. It looped down through the stony wastes, dropping almost a kilometer in altitude to the banks of the Sutlej and the towering remnants of Tsaparang. This was once the thriving center of the Guge kingdom, which a thousand years ago rescued Tibetan Buddhism from extinction. Centuries later, Tsaparang fell prey to invasion and a changing climate. Now it slumbers in austere isolation, a brown tumble of ruins beneath an azure sky, like some art director’s dream of an alien dystopia, an impression enhanced during our visit by the presence of a whining camera drone that flitted like a mosquito among the ruined towers, operated by an excitable Chinese TV crew. (Rather sweetly, they apologized and turned it off when we complained.)</td>

The company also didn’t adequately notify employees of infected co-workers, according to the complaint.</td>

      <td>The truth is coming out about Cuomo’s disastrous policy. Families like mine demand accountability.</td>
      <td>My mother, Joan Morris, died of Covid-19, which she contracted at a Brooklyn, N.Y., nursing home. She arrived there Jan. 24, 2020. She came down with Covid symptoms the week of April 5. She was sent to the hospital on April 10, was diagnosed with Covid on April 11, and died on April 17.<br />Last month the state acknowledged that 12,743 people died of Covid contracted in nursing homes because they were inexplicably put in harm’s way by the admission of new residents who were Covid-positive.<br />My mother’s death was entirely preventable. She had a treatable ailment (a broken vertebra) along with a pre-existing condition (advanced emphysema), and she would be alive today but for Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive order that forced nursing homes to accept Covid patients—which he issued despite the availability of thousands of beds in the empty Javits Convention Center, the largely unused Central Park field hospital, and the underused federal hospital ship USNS Comfort, which was stationed in New York for all of April. According to media reports, Mr. Cuomo and Health Commissioner Howard Zucker then undercounted, concealed and suppressed the nursing-home death toll.<br />My mother shouldn’t be a mere statistic on a dubious government chart. Unless there is meaningful accountability, the people Mr. Cuomo once called the most “precious” in our community will have died in vain. Families deserve to know the truth. State and federal prosecutors should open an investigation to determine if Mr. Cuomo’s executive response to Covid-19 was criminally negligent or a violation of laws against elder abuse.<br />Certainly it was an unprecedented public-policy disaster. Instead of owning its errors of judgment, the Cuomo administration pushed the Legislature to pass a measure shielding nursing homes from civil liability. This was a de facto grant of immunity for Mr. Cuomo’s policy decision, as lawsuits would have revealed the real numbers. The immunity was scaled back with another law in August, but it should be reversed entirely.</td>

      <td>Hydroponic countertop gardens that promise a bounty of lettuce, herbs and more are trending, but some say it takes weeks to get one salad. Here, the pros and cons.</td>
      <td>For the recurring series, That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and other emphatically opposed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />IN A PANDEMIC, the promise of automated indoor-gardening systems is compelling: Grow your own fresh herbs and veggies, with no need to brave superspreader supermarkets or dirty your fingernails. But is it worth devoting precious kitchen space to these devices—some as compact as a toaster, others as large as a bookshelf? Enthusiasts of hydroponic, or soil-free growing, say they’ll never go back to fretting over squirrels or hail. But naysayers argue that, given the investment of time and money, the economics might not add up. Here, both sides.<br />Laurie Stephans hasn’t bought lettuce or tomatoes from the grocery store in more than two years. Yet even in the depths of a Racine, Wis., winter—where temperatures struggle to reach the teens—she eats a salad filled with just-picked vegetables every day. Thank her fearsome fleet of 21 hydroponic planters.<br />These soilless devices have colonized many kitchens over the past year, their popularity stoked by alarming recalls of tainted produce and a desire to avoid crowded supermarkets. In the second quarter of 2020, revenue at  AeroGrow International ,  the parent company behind the AeroGarden brand of hydroponics, was up 245% year over year.<br />Unlike temperamental backyard plots, however, these planters promise to function as obediently as Keurigs. Simply pop in a few pods filled with seeds and growth medium, fill a water reservoir, hit a button and wait. The devices nourish, say, basil sprouts with a regulated supply of moisture and fertilizer while a canopy of sunlight-replicating LED lights shines down. After roughly 25 days, according to Click and Grow (and five times faster than seeds would sprout in the dirt, according to AeroGarden): Presto, pesto!</td>

      <td>Where does the Republican Party go from here? The party that abolished slavery, won the right to vote for women, and beat Soviet communism must continue to be strong and principled to move America forward.<br />But the liberal media doesn’t care about that. It wants to stoke a nonstop Republican civil war. The media playbook starts with the demand that everyone pick sides about Donald Trump—either love or hate everything about him. The moment anyone on the right offers the slightest criticism of the 45th president, the media goes berserk: Republicans are trying to have it both ways! It’s a calculated strategy to pit conservatives against one another. It’s also a ridiculous false choice. Real life is never that simple. Someone can do both good and bad things.<br />People feel strongly about Mr. Trump, but we can acknowledge reality. People on the left, if they’re honest, can find Trump accomplishments they like—a coronavirus vaccine in record time, Middle East peace, more accountability from China. People on the right can find fault with Trump actions, including on Jan. 6. Right or left, when people make these distinctions, they’re not trying to have it both ways. They’re using their brains.<br />Just as important, they’re proving people are more than their party affiliations. If we can’t make judgments beyond whether someone is Republican or Democrat, then America can’t face its biggest challenges. We separate into two camps that always hate each other. We become estranged from family and friends over politics.<br />Is that really what the anti-Trump media wants? Maybe. Hatred and polarization draw attention, ratings and clicks. But what’s good for them is bad for America. Some Never Trump and Always Trump Republicans also attack anyone who doesn’t join the all-or-nothing chorus. That’s not how I saw Mr. Trump conduct himself when I worked with him in the White House, where he engaged in internal debates, welcomed disagreements, and at times changed his mind.</td>

      <td>Controversial studies are aimed at understanding the virus and speeding vaccine development</td>
      <td>LONDON—U.K. medical-ethics authorities gave the go-ahead Wednesday to controversial trials that will deliberately infect young, healthy volunteers with coronavirus with the aim of better understanding the virus’s impact on the human body and speeding vaccine development.<br />The trials, called human challenge trials, will be the first in the world targeting Covid-19 and will initially involve up to 90 volunteers between 18 and 30 years old, the government said Wednesday. They are set to begin in London by March, backed by $47 million in U.K. government funding initially announced in October.<br />With medics and scientists standing by 24 hours a day, researchers will inject closely controlled doses of coronavirus into the noses of quarantined volunteers. This set of volunteers won’t have received vaccines. The idea is to start with the smallest possible amount that allows researchers to gauge infection levels, symptoms and transmission methods while trying to ensure the volunteers’ safety.<br />If that goes well, a second stage of the trials is planned to include the use of vaccines—researchers haven’t specified which ones—to test how well they protect against symptoms and possibly transmission. Vaccines would be administered to healthy volunteers, who would then be purposely infected with coronavirus, again in closed-off quarters to contain the virus.<br />Scientific and medical-ethics views about the proposed trials have been mixed since the U.K. revealed its plans in October, with this week’s green light making the U.K. a pandemic outlier. Previous challenge trials have focused on malaria, typhoid, cholera and flu.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is warning that rising tensions with China could have serious consequences for U.S. businesses, laying out a worse-case scenario where some major U.S. industries would be crippled.<br />Full decoupling—meaning a complete cutoff of sales to China—would cost the U.S. aircraft and aviation industry between $38 billion and $51 billion in sales annually, the report estimates. That would translate to between 167,000 and 225,000 jobs lost.<br />Similarly, an end to U.S. semiconductor sales to China would cost the industry $83 billion in revenue and 124,000 jobs, according to the report entitled “Understanding U.S.-China Decoupling.”<br />The scenarios laid out in the 88-page report envision a complete end to sales between the two intertwined economic superpowers—the kind of outcome that is only likely to happen in an all-out war.<br />Still, the Chamber argues, it is important to contemplate extreme cases as a way to focus policy makers on the costs involved in battling China.</td>

Groomed his entire life to run the auto empire, Mr. Chung, the 50-year-old grandson of Hyundai’s founder, has shirked convention, down to often changing the color on his company car—occasionally opting for gold or navy blue—instead of keeping the standard-issue black. He earned his M.B.A. in San Francisco during the 1990s dot-com boom and has become one of the auto industry’s most outspoken technologists.<br />But negotiations between the iPhone maker and Hyundai and its subsidiary  Kia Corp.  broke down, according to South Korean regulatory filings last week. Hyundai’s discussions for self-driving cars continue with unspecified others, according to the filings.<br />The failure to seal a deal shows how challenging the terrain is for Mr. Chung and Hyundai, if not the broader auto industry itself, struggling to partner up or home-brew solutions for future technologies outside the traditional lines of business.</td>

      <td>Entrepreneurs, intellectuals and presidential candidates have in recent years touted “universal basic income,” a cash stipend to everyone with no strings attached, as the answer to poverty, automation and the drudgery of work. It has never gotten off the ground in the U.S.<br />Instead, something similar in spirit but cheaper and more practical may be in sight. Both President Biden and Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) have proposed significantly expanding the child tax credit and dropping many of its restrictions, in effect turning it into a near-universal basic income for children.<br />The main aim of their proposals is to reduce child poverty, which is higher in the U.S. than in most advanced countries. Both would slash the number of children in poverty by around 3 million, or a third, according to the Niskanen Center, a center-right think tank.<br />In the process, it may also become the only major benefit in the U.S. that achieves near universality—testing traditional American notions of the safety net. “It would be a huge change in how we think about delivering benefits,” said Elaine Maag, principal research associate at the Urban Institute.<br />Federal benefits usually require the recipient to meet some criterion of need: poor (for food stamps, welfare and Medicaid), unemployed (for unemployment insurance), working or looking for work (the earned-income tax credit and some programs with work requirements), or disabled (Social Security Disability Insurance). Only Social Security and Medicare approach universality: Almost all elderly are eligible.</td>

      <td>Sales at the Italian brand have slipped further behind rival labels Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior in recent months</td>
      <td>During the pandemic, investors sought safety in a handful of top luxury stocks. Gucci’s owner  Kering  hasn’t made the cut despite its natural advantages.<br />On Wednesday the Paris-listed luxury company that also owns fashion labels Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta said sales in the three months through December fell 4.8% at constant exchange rates compared with the same period of 2019. Its most important cash cow, Gucci, reported a disappointing 10% drop in revenue. The worse-than-expected numbers sent Kering’s shares down 8% in early European trading.<br />Gucci had a much weaker fourth quarter than comparable brands at rival LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division, home to Louis Vuitton and  Christian Dior ,  increased sales by 18% in the fourth quarter. It isn’t just a recent phenomenon: Gucci hasn’t kept pace with LVMH’s fashion brands since early 2019 according to analysis by Bernstein. The pandemic is worsening the divide, though.<br />Gucci should have a competitive edge right now. Its owner has deep pockets to invest heavily in e-commerce, digital marketing and to expand in Asia where demand from Chinese consumers has rebounded quickly. That scale isn’t translating into clear market-share gains.<br />Kering has become too reliant on one brand—a problem investors have been pointing out for several years. Gucci generated 83% of group operating profit in 2019. While that level of exposure was a boon for shareholders in the early days of the label’s successful turnaround that kicked off around five years ago, performance is lagging now that the revamp appears to be running out of steam.</td>

While the majority of them were neutral on the stock last May, shares have nearly doubled since then, putting many of their predictions to shame. Shopify appears to be one of Wall Street’s more controversial names, with roughly half its analysts now recommending the stock and half still on the sidelines.<br />The divide is illustrative of the broader controversy for post-pandemic investing: When a company enjoys a massive pull-forward in usage, just how much can it continue to grow?<br />One thing is for certain: 2020 was an epic win for Shopify. On Wednesday, it posted results showing sales grew by more than 90% year over year for the third consecutive quarter. Merchant sales on its platform were up nearly 76% amid the Black Friday/Cyber Monday period alone.

      <td>Dozens of schoolboys and staff were kidnapped by gunmen in northwest Nigeria early Wednesday, according to local officials, the latest in a string of high-school abductions that have roiled the northern states of Africa’s most populous country.<br />The gunmen stormed the Government Science college in Kagara district of Niger state around 2 a.m. and overwhelmed the school security, killing one student before ordering students and staff to leave their hostels and gather, according to officials. “The situation is very serious…Some 27 students, 3 staff and 12 members of their family were kidnapped,” said Abubakar Sani Bello, the governor of Niger state. Unfortunately one student was shot dead.”<br />A photograph shared by the governor’s security officials showed the body of a student on the back of a pickup truck covered in a leaves. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.<br />Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, criticized for reacting slowly to previous abductions, dispatched the country’s military chiefs to coordinate a rescue operation, his spokesman said.<br />Shehu Sani, a former senator who studied in Kagara as a boy, said it was unclear how many people were missing but that the school was attended by some 1,000 students.</td>

      <td>Jakob Stausholm says the world’s second-largest mining company should be more aggressive in pursuing commodities used in low-carbon technologies</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—The new chief executive officer of  Rio Tinto  PLC wants to change a risk-averse culture at the world’s second-largest mining company that could see it pursue commodities vital to the energy transition more aggressively.<br />Jakob Stausholm said mining companies had become too cautious after overpaying for deals around a decade ago during a rush to feed China with metals and minerals vital to its industrialization, which left them vulnerable to hefty asset write-downs when commodity prices fell.<br />Facing an investor backlash at the time, companies including Rio Tinto moved to prioritize dividends to shareholders and buying back shares over deals or investments in new mines that could turn sour.<br />Rio Tinto’s annual result on Wednesday continued that trend. A 22% rise in net profit to $9.77 billion paved the way for a record final dividend and a special dividend in what was Mr. Stausholm’s first earnings update since succeeding Jean-Sébastien Jacques as CEO on Jan. 1. Mr. Jacques was ousted last year amid the fallout from the destruction of ancient rock shelters in a remote part of Australia.<br />Rio Tinto’s increased profit was driven by a rally in iron-ore prices to a nine-year high. Iron ore is used to make steel and has been one of the hottest commodities as China bets on infrastructure, such as new highways and apartment construction, to drive its economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.</td>

That followed results from a small clinical trial in South Africa that found the AstraZeneca vaccine didn’t appear to protect recipients from developing mild or moderate illness from the fast-spreading new strain of the coronavirus first detected in the country.<br />The J&J vaccine was found to be 57% effective at preventing moderate and severe Covid-19 symptoms in a larger trial held in South Africa, including from the B.1.351 variant, which has become the predominant version there. That was lower than the 72% efficacy rate observed during J&J’s trial in the U.K., which vaccine experts attributed to the South African variant’s ability to partially escape the immune response triggered by some Covid-19 vaccines.<br />When looking at just severe Covid-19 cases, the J&J vaccine was found to be 85% effective, including in South Africa.<br /></td>

The medium now attracts more than 100 million monthly active listeners, according to Edison Research.<br />The migration of listeners to on-demand audio, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, has sparked an arms race among major media and tech players, including  Spotify Technology SA,   Amazon.com Inc.  and  Sirius XM Holdings Inc.

      <td>Vaccines and therapeutics for Covid-19 have been an unexpected windfall for the drug industry, but Wall Street is less enthusiastic about cash windfalls</td>
      <td>For big pharma, a fresh $15 billion in sales just isn’t what it used to be.<br />Vaccines and therapeutics for Covid-19 have been an unexpected windfall for the drug industry, and there is more where that came from as the pandemic drags on.  Pfizer  said earlier this month that it expects to book $15 billion in sales from its Covid-19 vaccine in 2021. To put that figure in context, it is roughly equivalent to Pfizer’s entire oncology and immunology revenue in 2020. Pfizer’s total top line was just under $42 billion in 2020. What is more, that vaccine sales forecast is very conservative, as it only includes sales from doses from existing contracts with governments. Meanwhile,  Gilead Sciences  announced that it expects to sell between $2 billion and $3 billion of its antiviral drug remdesivir in 2021. It booked $2.8 billion in sales of the drug in 2020, most of it in the fourth quarter.<br />You wouldn’t think the pandemic was generating unexpected revenue by looking at those companies’ share prices. Both Pfizer and Gilead are down about 20% from their pandemic-era highs, and both stocks peaked as their drugs approached the market. That performance stands in marked contrast to smaller vaccine developers such as  BioNTech ,   Moderna  and  Novavax .<br />There are some valid reasons for that underperformance. Wall Street tends to place a low value on blockbuster drug sales if that drug faces a short shelf life, often because of an expiring patent or the expected approval of a superior medication. Those concerns are only amplified in a public health emergency since the pandemic’s ultimate duration is uncertain.<br />Even if annual booster shots become the standard in Covid-19 vaccination, as some drug executives and health officials have predicted, the onset of new competition likely means a tougher pricing environment in the future. After all, the flu shot is given annually but isn’t an especially lucrative product for the drug industry. And governments will be far more inclined to drive a hard bargain for future orders once the crisis abates.</td>

      <td>Competition between payment firms including PayPal and Affirm is intensifying, but the territory they are vying for is huge and diverse</td>
      <td>Several financial technology firms are eager to grow in the expanding realm of “buy now, pay later” lending. There likely is room enough in this town for everyone, at least for now.<br />Last week, one company that just went public in January, Affirm Holdings, and another established digital giant,  PayPal Holdings ,  discussed how they plan to win in this emerging lending category of short-term credit for shopping purchases. Both have plenty to be excited about:  PayPal  launched its Pay in 4 product last year, and already generated $750 million in volume in the fourth quarter. Affirm grew volume 41% quarter over quarter in the last three months of 2020 and said it has logged promising results in beta tests of its major new partnership with rapidly growing Shopify.<br />The fact is that buy now pay later, or BNPL, is a somewhat loosely defined thing. Some digital purchase installment loans are for just a few weeks; others can be for years. Some are for small-dollar purchases of ephemera, others for expensive durable goods. And while BNPL payment volumes are growing rapidly—by more than 50% among four big providers through the first nine months of 2020, according to Autonomous Research—they collectively represent just a couple percentage points of global e-commerce spending, which is itself growing rapidly. That leaves plenty of volume to fight over between these firms, as well as others such as  Afterpay  and Klarna and established card companies and banks that evolve their products to mimic BNPL in some respects.<br />Even if there is plenty of consumer demand and transaction opportunity, competition can still bite by pushing down what merchants are willing to pay the loan providers. Still, there are many models. Merchants may pay little for smaller, shorter-term, lower risk installments. But they may pay more when the lender is willing to take on more duration and credit risk to help customers who wouldn’t otherwise make a purchase. Firms that can regularly deliver those kinds of buyers, especially via their own networks, would have the most defensible fees.<br />For a relatively newer company like Affirm, a small number of major deals for prominent placement, particularly with marketplaces such as Shopify, have the potential to power big growth. Meanwhile PayPal has close to 30 million merchants on its platform and integrates Pay in 4 into its existing checkout button and pricing, so it has vast room to grow. BNPL also is just one of a growing list of features for what PayPal terms its evolving consumer “super app,” like discounts, pay-with-rewards, crypto, bill payments and more. It is the firms that hold on to consumers and win other business from them that may emerge the biggest winners.</td>

He added, “I would die for her,” in a video he posted to  Facebook  last month.<br />After being reported by people who witnessed the vaccination, he was targeted by prosecutors for criminal charges for demanding advantage as a public official, resigned and agreed to pay a $9,000 fine.<br />Brazil is only a month into its vaccination campaign against Covid-19, yet the country’s authorities have already been overwhelmed by several thousands of reports of people who circumvented the rules to get immunized before the most vulnerable.<br />Among those under investigation are politicians, influential business owners and lawyers, along with a host of other professionals, from veterinarians to fashion bloggers, most of whom incriminated themselves after posting vaccination selfies to social media, prosecutors said. Line jumpers have largely fallen into two groups, prosecutors say, the politically-connected or wealthy and those with friends in the medical community.</td>

He was arrested last year after disappearing during a visit to Dubai airport, before being paraded in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, in handcuffs. Mr. Kagame, who says Mr. Rusesabagina is a fugitive responsible for funding terrorism, denied he had been kidnapped but called the operation flawless.<br />The trial—which has been widely condemned by human-rights groups, members of U.S. Congress and the European Parliament, among others—is being seen as a signal that Rwanda’s government is prepared to reach far beyond its borders to squash dissent.<br />Mr. Kagame, in power for 20 years, has won plaudits for reducing poverty, attracting foreign capital from aid agencies and private investors, and winning support from Western leaders including Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.</td>

Ms. Ri’s public absence fueled speculation that she could be pregnant, ill, caring for a sick relative or purged.<br />South Korea’s spy agency this week told lawmakers Ms. Ri’s low profile could be due to concerns about Covid-19.<br />But at the Tuesday concert, North Korea’s first lady was shown smiling and without a face mask, sitting next to Mr. Kim in a crowded Pyongyang theater. She watched a song-and-dance performance honoring the birthday of Kim Jong Il, the current leader’s late father, during the country’s “Day of the Shining Star” holiday.<br />Ms. Ri, first mentioned as Kim Jong Un’s wife in 2012, initially appeared often in state media, a move that Pyongyang watchers said was aimed at humanizing the fresh-faced dictator.

      <td>The tussle between Big Tech and a government Down Under is a preview of the battle to come globally.<br />The Australian Parliament started debate this week on legislation to force digital platforms to negotiate with media companies on payment for news. Under the proposed law, if the two sides fail to reach a deal, they would be brought to binding arbitration. The bill would also require technology companies to give notice to news companies of algorithm changes that will materially affect traffic and to give the publishers collective-bargaining power. The government would determine which tech platforms are subject to the law, but it would likely start with  Google  and  Facebook ,  the dominant companies in online advertising. With bipartisan support, the legislation will likely pass soon.<br />The two American companies have pushed back hard. Google threatened last year to shut down its search engine in Australia. Facebook has said users in the country might not be allowed to share links to news articles if the bill is passed.<br />But the looming legislation seems to be forcing the two tech giants to the negotiating table. Google reached agreements with two of the country’s largest broadcasters this week, including a deal equivalent to $23.3 million a year deal with Nine Entertainment, according to local media.<br />While Australia is a small market for the companies—its online advertising market was valued at only $7 billion in 2019, according to Interactive Advertising Bureau—the new law could have big repercussions if other countries follow suit. The European Union overhauled its copyright laws in 2019, though the changes seem more limited in scope and power. How well the Australian approach works could end up shaping the regulatory direction there. European officials proposed two bills for regulating internet companies last month.</td>

For the entire year, revenue fell 23% to €7.4 billion.<br />The results mark a sharp turnaround for Gucci after years of outperformance under Creative Director Alessandro Michele. In the fourth quarter, Gucci lagged well behind the leading fashion brands of  LVMH  Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy SE: Louis Vuitton and Dior.<br />Those two brands reported surging revenue in the second half of last year after the industry was allowed to reopen its boutiques following lockdowns across the world in the first half of 2020. Revenue at LVMH’s fashion and leather-goods division—which is mostly Louis Vuitton and Dior—rose 14% for the quarter.<br />The drop during the pandemic has exposed Gucci’s heavy reliance on tourist shoppers, particularly for stores in Europe that have depended on Chinese clientele coming to the region. The brand is in the midst of tweaking its image to burnish its appeal among clientele older than 40, an effort partly directed at Europeans.</td>

      <td>Projected rise would follow three consecutive months of declining sales during the 2020 holiday shopping season</td>
      <td>U.S. shoppers likely boosted their spending in January, buoyed by the stimulus payments that many Americans received in the most recent $900 billion Covid-19 relief package.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimated that retail sales—a measure of spending at stores, vehicle dealerships, restaurants and online—increased a seasonally adjusted 1.2% in January from a month earlier. The projected rise would follow three consecutive months of declining sales during the 2020 holiday shopping season.<br />Robert Rosener, senior U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, forecasts the report “will be the start of exiting the worst of the softer data winter we’ve seen,” with the $600-a-recipient stimulus checks distributed in early January the main factor driving an uptick in spending.<br />Still, he said he expects spending was uneven across sectors last month, with categories like apparel and restaurants continuing to suffer from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and social-distancing measures. The U.S. experienced a sharp surge in coronavirus cases after the holidays.<br />Allen Merry said he used his recent stimulus check to buy a used acoustic guitar from a local musical instrument shop.</td>

More than 8.5 million shares were sold last year by insiders at these companies, compared with 4.7 million shares in 2019.<br />In dollar terms, much of the sales came at a single company, Moderna, maker of one of two Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. Executives and a director there sold more than $321 million of their stock in more than 700 transactions.  Merck  & Co. insiders sold $58 million of their shares. At  Novavax Inc.,  executives sold more than $40 million of their shares after the company’s vaccine hit milestones in August and September.<br />Merck, which last May said it was pursuing two vaccines, scrapped those efforts last month after data showed disappointing immune responses. Novavax announced positive results of its clinical trials last month.<br />Some of the sales toward the end of last year have drawn the attention of government officials, with the then-head of the Securities and Exchange Commission calling for new restrictions on the trading plans under which many of the sales were made.</td>

      <td>As richer nations secure supplies, poorer countries struggle to inoculate their populations</td>
      <td>In the race to vaccinate the world against Covid-19, developing countries are running dangerously behind as mutations of the virus make it harder to catch up—a situation that could spell at least another year of humanitarian and economic misery for poor nations.<br />The U.S. has now administered vaccine doses to around 15% of its population, while Europe has reached about 5%. But in South America, just 1.8% of the population had been given a vaccine by this week, while Asia reached 1.5% and Africa 0.1%, according to Our World in Data, a project based at Oxford University.<br />Almost 130 countries are yet to administer a single dose, the World Health Organization said recently. Just two countries in sub-Saharan Africa—the Seychelles and Mauritius—have started vaccinating a substantial proportion of front-line workers, though others are likely to roll out shots in the coming days.<br />The critically short supply of vaccines for poorer nations risks being curtailed further by the emergence of new variants of the virus, including in South Africa and Brazil, that appear to make some of the vaccines that have been secured less effective. Large parts of Africa and some countries in Latin America and Asia are unlikely to cover most of their populations before 2023 or 2024, experts say.<br />All that means it could be years before life returns to normal in poorer countries, which saw more than 100 million people fall back into extreme poverty last year and which lack resources to unleash government spending as much as rich countries have. Some emerging-market countries that were able to mount domestic stimulus last year are running out of resources to continue.</td>

      <td>Plenty of companies are cutting costs to weather the pandemic recession. Few are trying to do so while also spending billions of dollars to satisfy their regulators.<br />These are the tasks facing  Wells Fargo  & Co. Chief Executive Charles Scharf, who is attempting to slash at least $8 billion from the San Francisco bank’s annual budget. The bank’s expenses last year were $57.63 billion.<br />Wells Fargo is simultaneously shelling out money to remake the vast risk-and-control systems that regulators have said were inadequate to catch the fake-account scandal that got it in hot water more than four years ago. Wells is still subject to 10 regulatory penalties known as consent orders. The harshest, from the Federal Reserve, has capped the bank’s growth for three years.<br />How Wells Fargo fixes its back-end systems—and whether that clashes with other priorities—might hold clues for competitors as well. Wells came into the pandemic in worse financial shape than most large banks, but others must also modernize their controls while managing through the recession.<br />Citigroup Inc.  was hit with a $400 million fine over its own controls last year. The bank has been hiring key staff and making significant investments.  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. paid $250 million last year as a result of deficiencies in its internal controls, which it has remedied.</td>

But growth has slowed lately as the category matures and consumers opt for sparkling and flavored waters, which are drunk in smaller quantities.<br />Mainstream bottled water has faced fierce competition from store brands, making the category less attractive for Nestle, which in recent years has sought to sharpen its focus on faster-growing, more lucrative products such as infant formula, coffee and plant-based foods.<br />The cost of selling bottled water has also risen, while the pandemic has reduced sales of single bottles typically consumed at home.</td>

She later said this wasn’t a ceiling, but a bar they were trying to exceed.<br />Republicans and some parents called the threshold unacceptably low.<br />Mr. Biden, asked about the comments during the town hall at a Milwaukee theater, called it a “mistake in the communication” and said he had been pushing for opening most K-8 schools, which he called “the easiest to open, the most needed to be open.”</td>

But the prior relationship between Mr. LaPierre and the Brewer firm makes it “highly unlikely” that as the NRA’s counsel the Brewer firm would look into or advocate for any claims the group may have against him, the U.S. Trustee said.<br />“The statements in this legal filing, like others, reflect a misinformed view of the Brewer firm, its billings and its advocacy for the NRA,” said Charles L. Cotton, first vice president of the NRA. “I, and all the officers, fully support the work the firm is doing, the results achieved, and the value of its services.

The pandemic turned this process on its head, but it’s not all bad. Networking chats have become easier to set up. When connecting means clicking “join meeting” rather than traveling to a coffee shop, people are much more available.

      <td>How bad energy policy led to rolling blackouts in the freezing Lone Star State.</td>
      <td>Why are millions of Americans in the nation’s most energy-rich state without power and heat for days amid extreme winter weather? “The people who have fallen short with regard to the power are the private power generation companies,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott explained. Ah, yes, blame private power companies . . . that are regulated by government.<br />The Republican sounds like California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who lambasted private utilities for rolling blackouts during a heat wave last summer. Power grids should be able to withstand extreme weather. But in both these bellwether states, state and federal energy policies have created market distortions and reduced grid reliability.<br />Mr. Abbott blamed his state’s extensive power outages on generators freezing early Monday morning, noting “this includes the natural gas & coal generators.” But frigid temperatures and icy conditions have descended on most of the country. Why couldn’t Texas handle them while other states did?<br />The problem is Texas’s overreliance on wind power that has left the grid more vulnerable to bad weather. Half of wind turbines froze last week, causing wind’s share of electricity to plunge to 8% from 42%. Power prices in the wholesale market spiked, and grid regulators on Friday warned of rolling blackouts. Natural gas and coal generators ramped up to cover the supply gap but couldn’t meet the surging demand for electricity—which half of households rely on for heating—even as many families powered up their gas furnaces. Then some gas wells and pipelines froze.<br />In short, there wasn’t sufficient baseload power from coal and nuclear to support the grid. Baseload power is needed to stabilize grid frequency amid changes in demand and supply. When there’s not enough baseload power, the grid gets unbalanced and power sources can fail. The more the grid relies on intermittent renewables like wind and solar, the more baseload power is needed to back them up.</td>

      <td>As states weigh reform, a new project aims to collect best practices.</td>
      <td>Hundreds of bills to reform voting processes have already been introduced in state legislatures this year, but there’s plenty that the laboratories of democracy could learn from one another. To that end, it’s worth watching a new project of the Republican State Leadership Committee.<br />The RSLC, which is the umbrella group for GOP state lawmakers and secretaries of state, is launching a commission on election reform. “We want to find the best practices that are used in every state in the union, and make sure those are available for legislative bodies in the 50 states to consider as options,” says one of the co-chairs, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill. “We have a singular goal, and that is to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat—period.”<br />A call went out for ideas some weeks ago, and state leaders submitted suggested best practices on everything from signature verification to audit procedures to pre-election testing of voting equipment. The new commission’s role, Mr. Merrill says, will be to sort through that stack, and more, to “see how we can determine which ones need to be presented to legislative bodies across the nation.” The aim, he adds, is for the commission to have something substantive to release within weeks.<br />The potential here won’t be lost on anyone who followed the 2020 election mess. To take one example, voters amid the pandemic adopted mail ballots en masse, but some states don’t handle absentee votes until Election Day. Pennsylvania legislators considered allowing preprocessing but disagreed with the Governor on how many days were needed. That’s one small reason the Associated Press didn’t call Pennsylvania for Joe Biden until four days after Nov. 3. State law also lacks clear rules for signature verification, and counties diverged on whether to count undated ballots.<br />For states moving toward absentee voting, Mr. Merrill says, the model should be their peers like Colorado that have gone to mail ballots exclusively. “When you talk about mail-in,” adds the commission’s other co-chair, Michigan state Senator Ruth Johnson, “the devil is in the details, if you want to have that transparency and accountability and integrity. It’s not good or bad, necessarily, but the devil is in the details.”</td>
