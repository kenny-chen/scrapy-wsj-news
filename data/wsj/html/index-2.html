      <td>Aging usually brings greater calm and contentment. New research shows that’s still true in 2020, even though there is more coronavirus risk for the elderly.</td>
      <td><br />Psychologist Alison Gopnik explores new discoveries in the science of human nature. Read previous columns here.<br />As we get older we get slower, creakier and stiffer—and a lot happier. This might seem surprising, but it’s one of the most robust results in psychology, and it’s true regardless of income, class or culture. In our 70s and 80s, we are happier than when we were strong and beautiful 20-year-olds.<br />There are a couple of theories about why this is. We may get better at avoiding stressful situations—we figure out how to dodge that tense work meeting or family squabble. Or there may be something about aging that makes it easier to tolerate stress, even when we can’t avoid it.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic is a test case for this principle. It’s a terrible threat that is stressful for everyone, but it’s especially dangerous for older people, who are far more likely to die from the disease. Does the association between aging and happiness still hold?</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Brandon Bernard was executed Thursday, the second of six federal inmates scheduled to die between Election Day and Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden, who opposes capital punishment, takes office.<br />Mr. Bernard, 40 years old, received a lethal injection of pentobarbital at the federal penitentiary at Terre Haute, Ind., shortly after a divided Supreme Court declined to grant a stay of execution. He was pronounced dead at 9:27 p.m., according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.<br />The Terre Haute prison is scheduled to execute another federal inmate, Alfred Bourgeois, on Friday.<br />In 1999, at age 18, Mr. Bernard took part in a Killeen, Texas, carjacking that ended in a double murder on the grounds of Fort Hood. His attorneys argued his sentence was improper after recently disclosed evidence indicated that prosecutors withheld information allegedly casting doubt on his propensity for future violence, a factor essential to the government’s argument for the death penalty.<br />Under a landmark Supreme Court case from 1963, Brady v. Maryland, the government is obliged to turn over exculpatory evidence when the defense requests. In October, President Trump signed the bipartisan Due Process Protections Act, which requires that federal judges take steps ensuring that prosecutors comply with the 1963 precedent.  The new law didn’t apply to Mr. Bernard’s case retroactively.</td>

      <td>A divided nation holds little room for Northeast Republicans, Farm Belt Democrats</td>
      <td>Not long ago, voters in North Dakota and South Dakota sent Democrats to Congress, while voters in Connecticut sent Republicans. But today, the Farm Belt elects few Democrats, while the Northeast elects few Republicans.<br />The nation’s political divisions are rooted in geographic divisions, a trend that is clearly revealed by the changing party control of seats in the House of Representatives. Two decades of House maps show how Democrats have become the party of metropolitan America, particularly in the Northeast and the West. By contrast, Republicans are dominant in the heartland and in less-populous places outside the big metros, particularly in the South and much of the Midwest.<br />The chart below shows that in almost every election, the party that gains seats does so in all regions of the country. But amid those changes, the nation’s geographic divide has widened. While the Northeast and West in 2000 showed much different political profiles than the South, those differences are substantially wider today.<br />House maps over time show the changing contours of the parties’ strength in different parts of the nation.<br />The House map produced by the election of 2000 shows Democratic blue in North Dakota and northern Minnesota as well as splashes of blue in central Missouri, West Virginia and the Carolinas. Many of these regions were represented by “Blue Dog’’ Democrats, or centrist members of the party who won support from voters in rural communities, small towns and smaller metros.</td>

      <td>Senators and House members grapple with whether Congress should be prioritized ahead of constituents</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Congress is grappling with whether lawmakers should be among the first to receive the coronavirus vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve on an emergency basis in coming days.<br />The authorization is expected to lead to distribution by year’s end to limited groups such as health-care workers and the elderly, with several months until the general public is able to get vaccinated. Now policy makers face the question of whether lawmakers should receive priority as important elected officials and to give the public confidence in the vaccine—or whether they should wait in line with their constituents.<br />“There are ongoing discussions,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said on Wednesday. “Of course, many qualify in terms of the high-risk groups, in terms of age. But in addition to that, clearly, it is critical that we have the Congress in a condition where it can operate on a continuing basis, given the challenges that confront us of great immediacy.”<br />The Senate’s health-panel chairman, Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), said he had early Wednesday told Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and other public officials they needed to decide when lawmakers should be vaccinated.<br />“If they want public figures to take the vaccine early in order to reassure Americans that it’s safe, I’m sure many of us will do that,” Mr. Alexander said he told Mr. Redfield. “They need to say it’s more important for public figures to take it in order to encourage people to do it. If they do that, I’ll be glad to take it, but I’m not going to do that on my own. I’m going to do it when the public-health officials tell me it’s my turn.”</td>

      <td>The 2020 Major League Soccer season—in its normal, pre-pandemic form—lasted less than two weeks before grinding to a halt. Teams in early March were barely two games in. NYC FC was still waiting for its first goal. Inter Miami hadn’t even broken out its home jerseys.<br />As it turned out, that was only a false start. What followed over the next nine months was the wildest schedule attempted by any professional sports league in America.<br />When resuming the regular season seemed impossible, MLS rushed back to the field before the NBA or Major League Baseball to play a brand new tournament, invented specifically for 2020, inside a bubble in Florida. Once that worked out, MLS doubled down. Not only would it pick up its regular season—it would send teams back to their home markets to finish the interrupted season. While they were at it, MLS tacked on a full playoff slate for them too.<br />By the time the 2020 season ends, after Saturday’s MLS Cup final between the Seattle Sounders and the Columbus Crew, the league will have somehow organized 324 games in the year of the pandemic.<br />“We had no sense whatsoever that we’d be able to pull that off,” MLS Commissioner Don Garber said this week, looking back on the longest season in the league’s 25-year history.</td>

      <td>Entertainment titan’s ambitious new subscriber targets could put it past streaming pioneer</td>
      <td>Walt Disney Co.  only seems like a cautious company.<br />Fairly new to the streaming world, the entertainment giant has caught on quick. Disney+, its first streaming service under its flagship brand that only launched last November, now has 86.8 million paying subscribers. That’s about where the company first thought it would land after five years, and the success of the effort has convinced Disney to rethink its priorities—and pour some gas on the fire. The company announced late Thursday that its new target for Disney+ is a range of 230 million to 260 million paid subscribers by the end of its fiscal year 2024.<br />Even streaming pioneer  Netflix  hasn’t reached close to that level yet. And if you factor in Disney’s other streaming properties like Hulu and ESPN+, the company sees the full base of paid subscribers for its direct-to-consumer offerings hitting a range of 300 million to 350 million by September of 2024. Wall Street analysts currently expect Netflix’s global subscriber base to just be crossing the 300 million mark by that time, according to consensus projections tabulated by FactSet.<br />It is an ambitious goal, and hardly a sure thing, especially since both Disney and Netflix can chalk up a good deal of their recent success to the pandemic that has shuttered movie theaters, theme parks, restaurants and other entertainment options. Netflix has explicitly warned investors that much of its recent growth was likely pulled forward from future periods. And while Netflix is a streaming-only company, Disney made clear at a four-hour investor event Thursday that it is not throwing in the towel on theatrical movies. The company maintains plans to release big-budget movies next year and beyond from its properties including Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar and Disney.<br />But Disney now has a lot of ways to play both sides of the fence. The company previewed several shows and movies from its blockbuster franchises coming to Disney+. This includes a full Star Wars movie called “Andor” from Bourne movies screenwriter Tony Gilroy, coming in 2022. It also has several series coming from its Marvel universe, while its ownership of the old Twentieth Century Fox business and channels such as FX give the company plenty of material to appeal across audience types. The success of Disney+ gives the company options to stay flexible, contrasting with a recent move by  AT&T ’s  WarnerMedia division to move the full slate of its Warner Bros. theatrical movies targeted for next year to its HBO Max service, which has seen much lower adoption.</td>

      <td>Moderna, Pfizer now include children in trials, as health experts urge more such research to help curb transmission and reopen schools</td>
      <td>Pharmaceutical companies and health officials are homing in on a key sector of the population that has been largely left out of planning for Covid-19 vaccines: children.<br />Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  whose jointly developed vaccine is now being rolled out in the U.K., became the first Covid-19 vaccine developers to include children in U.S. trials in September.  Moderna Inc.,  whose vaccine has also shown to be effective in adults, said Thursday it began a trial for children 12 to 17 years old.  AstraZeneca  PLC also plans a U.S. trial for children.<br />The omission of children in U.S. vaccine trials so far worries public-health experts, who say they don’t know whether the vaccines are safe for children or need changes to dosage levels. While children are less likely than adults to fall gravely ill or die because of Covid-19, researchers say, vaccinating them will help prevent the spread of the virus and achieve herd immunity.<br />Yet some experts don’t expect a children’s vaccine will be ready by the 2021 school year because of how long trials take, even on the accelerated timeline for Covid-19 vaccines. “I’m pretty worried that the window’s closing if it hasn’t already closed,” said Evan Anderson, a pediatrics professor at the Emory University School of Medicine. “The timing then becomes a challenge in order to achieve enough data such that you’ve had a vaccine fully tested and evaluated over the spring and summer.”<br />The American Academy of Pediatrics recently sent a letter to federal officials urging children to be included in clinical studies. In the letter, AAP noted that more than two-thirds of the children who died from Covid-19 infections were Black or Latino.</td>

The charge of collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.<br />The police didn’t give further details, but a story in Mr. Lai’s newspaper, Apple Daily, said the charge was “reportedly based on Lai’s acceptance of interviews and calls for sanctions from foreign governments.”<br />Enforcement actions against pro-democracy figures have been accelerating in Hong Kong. In recent weeks, authorities expelled opposition lawmakers from the legislature and jailed prominent activists including Joshua Wong on crimes related to the mass protests that rocked Hong Kong last year.<br />On Monday, Hong Kong police arrested eight men related to a peaceful protest at a university this year, three of them on suspicion of national security crimes. On Tuesday, police arrested seven pro-democracy activists, including a former lawmaker, related to participation in a protest on July 1, the day after the national security law was imposed.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—For a year that started out with a share crash, a record loss and a global pandemic, 2020 is turning out to be very good for  SoftBank Group  Corp.<br />The Japanese technology investor, best known for its $100 billion Vision Fund and its mercurial chief executive, Masayoshi Son, this week scored an estimated $11 billion paper gain when U.S. food-delivery company  DoorDash Inc.  went public. It was the latest in a series of wins as soaring tech stocks pushed up the value of many of  SoftBank ’s  holdings.<br />Cashing in on another investment, SoftBank said Friday that it agreed to sell an 80% stake in Boston Dynamics, a company known for dog-like robots that can maneuver through rooms, to  Hyundai Motor Group .  The deal valued the robotics company at $1.1 billion. SoftBank has said more of its portfolio companies are poised to list or go on sale next year.<br />SoftBank’s share price has increased, too—around 9% this week alone and 66% this year. That puts this week’s stock level at its highest in 20 years, but still more than 20% below the bubble peak. The shares, which finished trading at 7,913 yen, equivalent to $76.04, on Friday, were pushed up by the overall market swell as well as a roughly $23 billion share-buyback program that is one of the world’s largest.<br />As of Friday, SoftBank has bought back around $14 billion of that total. The company is considering further buybacks that will lower the amount of shares outstanding and raise Mr. Son’s stake, said people with knowledge of the strategy. That in turn could make it easier for Mr. Son to realize a long-held idea of taking SoftBank private, they said.</td>

      <td>High prices will require capital discipline from the U.S. shale industry as well as a rebound in global demand</td>
      <td>Vaccines have buoyed hopes that oil demand will soon recover, and the Brent global benchmark is back above $50 a barrel. But traders may be underestimating the responsiveness of U.S. supply.<br />It has been a terrible year for the oil industry. A price war followed by a global pandemic forced many producers to slash spending on the search for new oil reserves. Historically, significant underinvestment in drilling has prompted a price spike when demand eventually rebounded, given the long lead time to find and develop new oil sources.<br />U.S. shale oil has changed that dynamic in recent years, though. The sector’s ability to ramp up production rapidly means the high prices that historically resulted from big cuts to capital expenditure no longer look to be such a sure thing. Also, the U.S. industry has for years frustrated efforts by Moscow and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase prices by cutting production, creating a glut. A recent proposal to add the main U.S. export price, WTI Midland, to the global oil benchmark from 2022 is a testament to shale oil’s importance in global supply.<br />True, shale producers have consolidated this year and come under investor pressure to focus on cash flow rather than growth. “The rules of the game have changed” and the industry no longer has access to the “incredible amounts of capital” it did just a year ago, says Benjamin Shattuck of energy consultant Wood Mackenzie.<br />Yet any newfound discipline may not last. Oil is up about a quarter since early November, when the first effective vaccine was announced. At the current U.S. benchmark price of just under $47, many reserves could be profitably lifted, particularly with today’s lower drilling costs. “As you move above $45 a barrel it gives you way more commercial drilling,” says Alisa Lukash of energy consultant Rystad Energy, referring to U.S. shale.</td>

Then he saw a promo on the Points Guy, a blog focused on travel-club loyalty points, for $150 off bookings with Koala, a new platform that follows Airbnb’s model but allows individuals to rent one-time stays in timeshares that would otherwise sit unused.<br />Through Koala, Mr. Florez booked a week stay in a two-bedroom condo that put him within minutes of Disney World and came with amenities like a swimming pool and concierge. Thanks to the Points Guy promo, the cost was a mere $475, or about $68 a night.<br />Covid-19 has battered the travel industry. One-third of American hotels face potential bankruptcy. U.S. air traffic has stalled—in October, U.S. airlines carried 62% fewer passengers than the same month last year. But one sector of the industry continues to grow and is actually thriving in the face of the pandemic: the stodgy old timeshare industry.<br />Traditional timeshares—vacation rentals where ownership is split among several parties—took root in the 1960s. The Hilton Hale Kaanapali, a 253-room condo hotel on Maui, was among the first. Advertised as a “whale of a place to play,” it opened in 1966, with studios priced from $26,000 that could be booked for a maximum of 30 days a year. The timeshare model started popping up in all the usual vacation spots as eager developers lured potential buyers to sales presentations with free toasters and discount helicopter tours. The bait paid off. According to the American Resort Development Association (ARDA), there are currently more than 5,000 timeshare resorts in 121 countries.<br />In early 2020, fear and lockdowns kept customers away from traditional hotels and rental properties. But because timeshares are like second homes for their owners, they didn’t experience the same extreme drop-off, even at the height of coronavirus lockdowns in spring 2020. “Once regulations began to be lifted in July, some places saw occupancies of 100%,” said Jason Gamel, president and CEO of the ARDA.</td>

Money manager Jacinto Hernandez has doubts.<br />The partner at Capital Group Cos. liquidated $1 billion in oil and gas stocks as Covid-19 spread around the globe in February, according to regulatory filings. Mr. Hernandez said he suspected the new coronavirus was about to crush global demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel—and with it, any near-term thesis for investing in oil companies.<br />Adam Waterous, a Canadian private-equity investor, looked at the same circumstances and came to the opposite conclusion: This was the time to buy. Demand will eventually bounce back, he said, and when it does, prices will spike sometime later this decade. He backed up that conviction in July when his Waterous Energy Fund purchased a big stake in an oil sands company.<br />“There is absolutely a stigma about investing in oil and gas,” Mr. Waterous said. “It hasn’t been a sexy industry for a while.”<br />The question of whether to invest in oil and gas has become a polarizing issue in the world of money management. Even before the pandemic sapped the world’s thirst for fuel, the future of the fossil-fuel industry was already under threat due to the rise of electric cars, the proliferation of renewable energy and growing consciousness about the long-term impact of climate change.</td>

That will boost the status of already-powerful brands, as well as tech giants like  Amazon  that are eyeing the industry.<br />The luxury business got a crash course in e-commerce when boutiques were closed this year. “Brands made the mental switch from treating digital as 5% of their current business to 35% of future revenue,” says Ian Rogers, the outgoing chief digital officer at  LVMH  Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which poached him from Apple in 2015.<br />Traditionally, high-end brands have been cautious about selling online. While they were growing rapidly, digital transactions were a relatively low 12% of global luxury sales in 2019. They are expected to hit 23% in 2020 and up to one-third by the middle of the decade, according to Bain & Co. projections.<br />Paris-based LVMH, which owns  Christian Dior  and Fendi as well as its namesake brands, spent heavily on e-commerce during the lockdowns. Although the company reduced its overall investment budget this year to save cash, digital’s share of the spending doubled to roughly 25%.<br />Boundaries between store and website sales also blurred in new ways this year. With boutiques closed, shop assistants resorted to contacting customers through messaging apps or arranged digital consultations to drive business. Gucci’s parent company, Kering, expects these so-called “distance sales” to stick. In the future, store workers may log on during quiet times and interact with online shoppers to improve the low sales conversion rates that afflict many luxury-brand websites.</td>

      <td>Proposal would add accountability, transparency to process by having constituents work with lawmakers to apply for ‘community-focused grants’</td>
      <td>A BIPARTISAN GROUP of lawmakers makes a push to bring back a form of earmarks—lawmakers’ ability to direct federal funding to specific projects —but with more transparency and accountability. The 12 members of the bipartisan House Select Committee on Modernization, a group responsible for updating how Congress operates, are pushing to start a program of “community-focused grants,” which they hope would help restore Congress’s role in making specific decisions about spending taxpayer money.<br />“We laid out a framework that we thought could avoid some of the abuse of the past,” the group’s chairman, Washington Democratic Rep. Derek Kilmer told The Wall Street Journal’s Kristina Peterson. Under the proposal, local communities would work with their members of Congress to apply for a grant through a public database. If approved through the appropriations process, the funds would be subject to congressional oversight and could even be clawed back if lawmakers deemed they were being abused.<br />“It has to be uniquely derived from a local community,” said committee vice chairman Rep. Tom Graves (R., Ga.). For-profit entities wouldn’t be eligible to apply. “The member now becomes more of an advocate for or a shepherd for something that’s important to a local community.” The House banned earmarks in 2011, after the GOP won the majority in Nov. 2010.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) has spoken in favor of restoring some form of earmarks, but it’s not clear how receptive GOP leaders would be in the House or Senate. “Earmarks cause members to vote for excessively expensive spending bills that cost tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in exchange for a few earmarks worth a few million or sometimes just thousands of dollars,” says the Citizens Against Government Waste, an influential conservative group.<br />MAKE FOUNDATIONS SPEND? A coalition of progressive multimillionaires, foundation heads, think tanks, and donor-advised fund managers is calling on Congress and the incoming Biden administration to make a temporary change to tax law to make private foundations give away more of their money  if they want to qualify for tax deductions. They urge the Biden administration and Congress to double the minimum required disbursement by private foundations, set by the Internal Revenue Service. Foundations are now required to pay out 5% of their endowment each year; the letter calls for raising it to 10% for the next three years to raise around $200 billion for struggling charities, without the use of taxpayer funds.</td>

The State Department reiterated its policy of declining to comment on future sanctions.<br />Despite pressure from some lawmakers, the Trump administration had held back on sanctions over the missile system, although President Trump said last year the U.S. would withhold sales of advanced F-35 stealth jet fighters to Turkey.</td>

Hunter Biden is implicated in that investigation but was never a specific target for criminal prosecution, the people said.

      <td>Facebook ’s  motto in its early days was to “move fast and break things.” That’s also one way to describe the Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Facebook that was seconded this week by 46 state Attorneys General. That so many lawyers could come up with such a weak legal case is remarkable.<br />CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t have many political friends these days in either party. He has been criticized for restricting speech on his platform both too much and too little. Facebook has helped to destroy the advertising market for newspapers, and the world might be better off without it.<br />But the purpose of U.S. antitrust law isn’t to remedy social or political problems. That’s essentially what the FTC on a 3-2 vote and the AGs are seeking with their lawsuits that asks courts to force Facebook to divest its Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014) acquisitions.<br />According to the FTC complaint, Mr. Zuckerberg sought to buy Instagram and WhatsApp to neutralize competition. Well, sure. “It is better to buy than compete,” Mr. Zuckerberg emailed in 2008. Any business must adapt as technology and consumer tastes change. Mr. Zuckerberg saw how smart phones increased photo sharing and private instant messaging.<br />It was less expensive and easier for Facebook to acquire apps than build copycats. But bigger companies buy upstarts all the time. Note also that Instagram and WhatsApp were complementary apps to Facebook, not direct competitors. Many people use parallel social-media platforms with distinct features such as TikTok,  Twitter ,   Pinterest ,  Reddit and Snap.</td>

We never were able to hand it to her, but she got employee of the month for bringing attention to Goya and our adobo.”<br />Ms. Ocasio-Cortez now denies that she ever called for a boycott, tweeting that all she did was tweet about learning to make her own adobo, and that any suggestion otherwise is a matter of Fox News indulging in “their made up fantasies.” Adobo happens to be one of Goya’s most popular seasonings and her search for an alternative came in the thick of the boycott calls. CNN reported at the time that “Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet that she’d boycott Goya.”<br />We’re glad that Mr. Unanue, who pointed out he’d participated in similar initiatives for Barack and Michelle Obama, never backed down and his company wasn’t harmed.

      <td>Can a state be harmed by the way other states conduct their elections?</td>
      <td>Ken Paxton, the Texas Attorney General, seems intent on developing a name for himself as the patron saint of lost legal causes. He’s the father of the recent and long-shot case against ObamaCare, and this week he launched another implausible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn state presidential election results.<br />In Texas v. Pennsylvania, Mr. Paxton, joined by 17 other states and President Trump, claims that four states have harmed Texas by violating their election laws in ways that poisoned the result. He wants the Court to take the case directly, in “original jurisdiction,” and order the legislatures in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia to overturn election certifications for Joe Biden.<br />The Court asked the four states to reply by 3 p.m. Thursday, but it would be a legal and political earthquake if the Court took the case. Cases of original jurisdiction—when a state bypasses lower courts and goes directly to the Supreme Court—are rare and typically involve interstate disputes. This one concerns election law in states other than Texas.<br />The first issue is whether Texas has the legal standing to sue. To have standing, a plaintiff must point to a specific injury and there must be some possibility of a remedy. In this case, what is the injury? No one is interfering with Texas’s authority to deliver its Electoral College votes.<br />Mr. Paxton argues that the four states have harmed his state and violated the Electors Clause of the Constitution by holding elections with major procedural irregularities. He’s saying Texas can be harmed by the way another state manages its elections. But if Texas can sue on these grounds, then some unhappy state will sue another state after every close election whose outcome it doesn’t like.</td>

      <td>So Hunter Biden’s business is news after all. Who knew? Well, the New York Post did, and so did we and a few others.<br />But in October when the Post broke the story of an email, allegedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop, referring to a meeting he’d arranged between his father and an executive from a Ukrainian energy company, Democrats and most of the press told Americans it was Russian disinformation. The story was banned on  Twitter .  But with the election over, presto, even CNN’s Jake Tapper is a born-again bloodhound.<br />That is itself a scandal. When the younger Mr. Biden’s business relationships first surfaced—e.g., his highly paid position on the Burisma corporate board, despite no background in Ukraine or energy—it should have provoked serious reporting. Instead, the people who spent years claiming Donald Trump was a Russian agent ignored much stronger evidence that the younger Mr. Biden had been getting rich on his father’s name. He sometimes traveled to business meetings as a tag-along with his Vice President dad on Air Force II.<br />These latest reports are no surprise to Sens. Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley, the chairmen of investigating Senate committees. In September they released a joint report detailing some of Hunter’s million-dollar dealings with politically connected foreigners. The report said they raised “serious counterintelligence and extortion concerns relating to Hunter Biden and his family.”<br />The press yawned. One who did not was our Kimberley Strassel. On Oct. 22 she wrote a column headlined “The Biden ‘Family Legacy,’” based on email and texts between Hunter and business partner Tony Bobulinski that suggest Joe Biden’s son knew exactly what he was cashing in on. At one point he reminded Mr. Bobulinksi that the heads of CEFC China Energy, a Shanghai-based conglomerate closely entwined with the Chinese government, are “coming to be MY partner to be partners with the Bidens.”</td>

The retailer’s e-commerce sales jumped 86% in the quarter.<br />Big-box retailers including  Walmart Inc.  and  Target Corp.  have generally fared well amid the coronavirus crisis, offering pandemic-weary shoppers one-stop shopping and in some cases, easy buy online, pick up in store parking lot options.<br />Costco’s shoppers, who pay a membership fee to shop, are spending less on travel and eating out during the pandemic and more on food, appliances, homegoods and other items, said finance chief Richard Galanti on a call with analysts Thursday. “They seem to have redirected some of those dollars,” he said.<br />Profit also rose during the quarter to $1.17 billion, up from $844 million in the same period last year. Costco raised wages during the quarter due to Covid-19, adding about $212 million in costs for the period, said Mr. Galanti. But the company boosted profits elsewhere, for example selling more food by reducing spoilage, he said. Costco has extended premium wages through January, he said.</td>

      <td>Judiciary will have the last word on bipartisan allegations that Facebook illegally maintains a monopoly</td>
      <td>The sweeping government antitrust lawsuits against  Facebook Inc.  laid down a new bipartisan marker for enforcement after years of hesitancy, but they will be tested by a federal court system that has proved skeptical of broad antitrust intervention.<br />The lawsuits, filed Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission and 46 states, allege the social-media giant illegally preserved a social-networking monopoly through a years-long campaign of freezing out potential rivals and buying nascent competitors such Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook vowed a vigorous court battle, saying its acquisitions made those apps better. It accused the government of attempting to rewrite history.<br />The cases come amid a national debate about whether a handful of tech companies have become too dominant—and whether antitrust enforcers should have done more to police powerful firms and concentrated industries. Criticism of the FTC and Justice Department, which share antitrust authority, has come from Democrats and Republicans alike.<br />The agencies, however, can’t impose their will by fiat, and must instead prove their cases in court. With the current calls for more enforcement, the DOJ and FTC have shown more willingness to test those waters. Weeks before the Facebook suit, the Justice Department and 11 states brought an antitrust case against Google. More states may join soon with additional claims against the search giant.<br />The last few years, however, also showed the pitfalls antitrust enforcers face with the courts, which have become more conservative and have weakened antitrust precedents in recent decades. In August, a federal appeals court ruled the FTC didn’t prove that  Qualcomm Inc.  unlawfully preserved a monopoly in cellphone chips. A New York federal judge in February rejected a bid by a group of state attorneys general to block  T-Mobile US Inc.’s  takeover of Sprint Corp.</td>

      <td>Waiting on the Covid booster would allow more people to be vaccinated sooner.</td>
      <td>Recent days brought good news and bad news about coronavirus vaccines. The developments could add up to months of delay in getting most Americans inoculated. But there’s a way to make use of the good news to speed up herd immunity.<br />The bad news is that in July the U.S. passed up an opportunity to secure by June 2021 more than 100 million doses of the  Pfizer  vaccine, now expected to receive emergency-use authorization in the next few days. Instead, officials followed a balanced-portfolio strategy that reserved as many as 300 million doses of the  AstraZeneca  vaccine, whose prospects are unclear.<br />The good news is that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines performed at the upper end of expectations, with 95% efficacy after two doses. And intriguingly, Pfizer’s submission to the Food and Drug Administration shows that the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing disease had largely kicked in by two weeks after the first dose, and there was no dramatic increase in efficacy after the booster was given three weeks later.<br />The protocol in Pfizer’s clinical trial was to give all participants two doses. The FDA is likely to approve this protocol, and standard procedure is to prescribe a drug according to protocol. But we are in a pandemic and supplies of vaccine are inadequate. There’s an alternative: vaccinating as many people as possible with a first dose and waiting on the booster until supplies are plentiful.<br />The Pfizer study wasn’t designed to put a number on first-dose efficacy, but the data in Pfizer’s “cumulative incidence curves” suggest at least 75% efficacy for two weeks after one dose. The question is whether to use the 100 million doses on 50 million people, of whom two doses would protect roughly 47.5 million, or to give one dose each to 100 million people and protect at least 75 million.</td>

      <td>Whether American forces stay or leave, the fighting is guaranteed to continue. Why not cut our losses?</td>
      <td>It was the shot of a lifetime. A lone Taliban fighter, armed with a cheap rocket-propelled grenade launcher, had destroyed the enormous surveillance blimp tethered to our patrol base. The $500 rocket tore through the blimp from end to end, obliterating $25 million of vital cameras and sensors. The explosion sounded like the sky itself was being ripped apart.<br />The destruction of the blimp left our little outpost vulnerable at the worst possible moment. The long-planned withdrawal of U.S. Marine units from northern Helmand province was scheduled to begin in weeks. Preparations had been under way for months; the impending operation was no secret to either side. Robbed of our critical eye in the sky, we braced ourselves for what we assumed was the next step in an audacious Taliban plan to maximize our casualties as Marines and allies withdrew from our patrol bases to the relative safety of Camp Leatherneck, a few hours drive south.<br />Our worst fears never materialized. That cold winter of 2013 witnessed the largely undisturbed departure of thousands of American and allied troops from Afghanistan’s deadliest province. In the end, the Taliban chose to keep most of their powder dry, conserving resources to fight their fellow Afghans rather than sacrificing fighters in high-profile but tactically meaningless attacks against departing foreigners.<br />In the rest of Afghanistan, whenever American troops finally do depart for home, a similar scenario is likely to play out. Yet President Trump’s decision to commence a new Afghanistan troop drawdown has prompted bipartisan outrage. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth raised the specter of more “Americans in body bags,” while Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio invoked the chaos of Saigon in 1975. Retired generals and journalists added their voices to the chorus, condemning this supposedly precipitous withdrawal. But our own experience suggests that this consternation is overblown.<br />Mr. Trump’s troop drawdown may well be politically motivated, but it also reflects a realistic appraisal of the facts on the ground. The Taliban are increasingly ascendant on the battlefield; they now control or contest nearly half the country. Civilian casualties in October were the highest in more than a year. Continued civil war is likely to be the next chapter of Afghanistan’s story, whether U.S. forces stay or leave.</td>

      <td>Advent and Epiphany are also holy days. Why not call them all what they are?</td>
      <td>The season of good tidings often brings an awkward moment. It has happened in the checkout line, on a phone call, during a quick conversation with a neighbor. I’ll say, “Merry Christmas.” The other person will respond, “Happy holidays.” Tranquility turns to tension. A simple exchange of well wishes ends uncomfortably.<br />But this year will be different. I’m going to say “happy holidays”—not only in response to others but as my default December greeting. Far from being an effort to avoid religious language, I’ve come to understand that the phrase is inherently religious and respectful.<br />Many of the evangelical Christians I grew up with, and the Catholics whom I have since joined, feel hesitant about “happy holidays.” Sometimes that hesitation becomes outright hostility. This attitude comes from the justifiable fear that Judeo-Christian traditions and cultural trappings are being swept away by a secular tide. Language has the power to shape what we believe and think, the argument goes, so abandoning the word “Christmas” speaks to a broader abolition of the Christian faith in the public square.<br />There’s no doubt that secularism is rising, and plenty of Americans say “happy holidays” to steer clear of religion, although many others use it to be inclusive of other religious traditions, including Hanukkah.<br />Yet those two words can’t be divorced from the reality of the Christmas season. Drawn from Old English, the word holiday is a combination of “holy” and “day.” It is an unwitting acknowledgment that this is, in fact, a transcendent season. As far as season’s greetings go, the phrase seems warm and true and perfectly apt.</td>

      <td>A British neurologist explores his passionate identiﬁcation with the reckless adventurer Percy Harrison Fawcett.</td>
      <td>Like the late Oliver Sacks, Andrew Lees is a British neurologist who is also a talented writer of memoir, medical reportage and travelogue. Like Sacks, who died in 2015 at 82, Dr. Lees has made personal eccentricity into something of a cottage industry. A sense of oddness informs Dr. Lees’s books, perhaps even more so than those of Sacks, whose signature volumes, such as “Awakenings” and “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,” at least tempered their strange sensibility with mass-market appeal.<br />But the chief lure of Dr. Lees’s books—and their abiding complication—is that they defy easy classification. This was surely true of “Mentored by a Madman,” a 2017 account of how the drug-addled beat poet William Burroughs shaped Dr. Lees’s research into Parkinson’s disease. It’s equally the case with “Brazil That Never Was,” which chronicles his obsession with the vanished British explorer Percy Harrison Fawcett.<br />Fawcett disappeared in 1925 while searching for a legendary lost city along the Amazon. His exploits were the subject of David Grann’s popular 2009 biography “The Lost City of Z,” which was adapted into a 2016 film. But it was an earlier book about Fawcett that first got Dr. Lees’s attention.<br />After Fawcett’s disappearance, his son Brian, hoping to keep his father’s flame alive, published “Exploration Fawcett” (1953), billed as a collection of the explorer’s own writings about his previous adventures. Dr. Lees wonders to what degree Brian Fawcett had a hand in shaping the text, which seemed to anticipate Indiana Jones in its vivid depictions of danger narrowly escaped in exotic locales.<br />Whatever the provenance of “Exploration Fawcett,” it became a seminal scripture of Dr. Lees’s childhood as he grew up in the West Riding of Yorkshire in the 1950s. After Dr. Lees’s father recommended to him a library copy of the book, the young boy was hooked. “Fawcett challenged me to travel with him to intangible worlds,” Dr. Lees recalls, “where everything was connected to everything else and the unfathomable was within reach . . . The evenings that I spent reading Exploration Fawcett were as alive as any I can now remember. It was as if the book had chosen me, rather than the other way round.”</td>

      <td>A diagnosis of entitlement culture, the story of populist radio and more of the year’s standouts.</td>
      <td>Christopher Caldwell’s “The Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties” (Simon and Schuster, 352 pages, $28) appeared in January, before the George Floyd riots or the coronavirus panic, but a careful reader of this penetrating study of postwar America might have foreseen the reckless lunacy occasioned by both events. Mr. Caldwell contends that, with the passage and signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the nation’s leaders established a new de facto constitution under which the purpose of politics was to remake civil society according to enlightened theories of racial justice. American leaders set about erecting enormously powerful and cripplingly expensive government agencies and programs to guarantee a state of racial equality. When their efforts failed, their successors created more such agencies and programs, and cultivated the destructive social convention known as political correctness to punish dissenters.<br />Both Republican and Democratic leaders, Mr. Caldwell contends, believed they could spend endless billions on a doomed enterprise and accrue no societal cost; they were bound, or “entitled,” to succeed. Over the past several months we’ve seen American elites blame the cops for a half-century of their own policies’ failure and shut down the bulk of the private-sector economy as if the government doesn’t need it to make everything run. The Age of Entitlement is still very much in progress.<br />America’s wealthy and educated classes come in for another condign drubbing in Michael Lind’s “The New Class War: Saving Democracy From the Managerial Elite” (Portfolio, 203 pages, $25). Mr. Lind is far, I believe, from being a Marxist, but his account of 2016’s populist revolt feels to me like economic determinism. What makes his book work so brilliantly, though, isn’t so much his economic interpretation of our political quandary as his acid analysis of “technocratic neoliberalism.” One salient component of that worldview, Mr. Lind writes in a passage I particularly relished, “is to medicalize politics and treat differing viewpoints as evidence of mental and emotional disorders.” Hence the “phobia” suffix: Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia and so on. This habit of mind he finds as far back as Richard Hofstadter’s 1964 essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” surely among the most overrated and malign political compositions of the 20th century.<br />Was there ever a time when comity and reasonableness prevailed? Well, perhaps; but as Paul Matzko reminds us in “The Radio Right: How a Band of Broadcasters Took on the Federal Government and Built the Modern Conservative Movement” (Oxford, 304 pages, $34.95), distrust and acrimony were always part of American politics, too. The birth of modern American conservatism is usually attributed to William F. Buckley Jr., Frank Meyer and other midcentury intellectuals; Mr. Matzko insists that it began with a band of anticommunist and fundamentalist radio broadcasters in the 1940s and ’50s. In the ’60s radio personalities such as Carl McIntire and Billy James Hargis began delivering daily invectives against President John F. Kennedy’s Soviet policies to millions of listeners. That led the president and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, to seek a means of retaliation, which they found in a plan drawn up by a pair of communist-sympathizing labor leaders, Victor and Walter Reuther.<br />Not only did the Kennedy brothers implement a scheme of government-empowered intimidation against their critics; the National Council of Churches got in on the bullying, too. “The Radio Right” is an impressively researched and lucidly written work of scholarship.</td>

      <td>From picture-book travels to fantastic adventures, a treasure-filled year of reading.</td>
      <td>Four of the year’s best picture books have waterways—real, metaphorical, man-made—that wind through them, taking young readers on empathetic journeys of imagination. In “Birrarung Wilam” (Candlewick, 40 pages, $17.99), the waterway is a real one, Australia’s Yarra River, which gathers itself from tributaries far inland and runs through the city of Melbourne to the sea. The text of this exceptional book, by Aunty Joy Murphy and Andrew Kelly, has an incantatory magic, mingling English and the Aboriginal language of Woiwurrung: “As ngua rises, turning clouds over the distant city red . . . Birrarung begins its long winding path down to palem warreen.” What do all these words mean? Children will be able to guess from what they see in Lisa Kennedy’s evocative and rough-feeling paintings (see above). They can also check the glossary at the back. This is a marvel for reading aloud, a dreamlike sojourn through a distinctive riverine ecology.<br />The chattering, churning, whirling waters of Jordan Scott’s autobiographical picture book “I Talk Like a River” (Holiday House, 40 pages, $18.99) exist both inside and outside its young narrator, a boy who suffers from a debilitating stutter. “At school, I hide in the back of the class. I hope I don’t have to talk,” he tells us. “When my teacher asks me a question, all my classmates turn and look.” In sublime and poignant paintings, Sydney Smith shows the child’s struggle, his misery and shame—and then the glorious, sun-dappled afternoon when his father uses an example from nature to transform the boy’s understanding of himself: “I talk like a river.”<br />With enigmatic black-and-white illustrations, “The Wanderer” (Levine Querido, 96 pages, $21.99) takes readers on a gorgeous, wordless odyssey from one side of the world to another. Peter Van den Ende’s intricate drawings follow a little paper boat as it travels through oceans and seas teeming with wonders: undulating monsters, playful mermen, and aquatic creatures that resemble elephants, cheetahs and medieval jesters. Wandering, the vessel moves beneath starry skies, passing ice floes and oil rigs until, at last, it enters the waters of a moonlit canal, where a mysterious passenger disembarks. Given the absence of text, the book may seem accessible to readers of any age, but its sophistication makes it best suited to those over the age of 8.<br />Rivers unfurl like pretty ribbons across distant landscapes in “If You Come to Earth” (Chronicle, 80 pages, $18.99), a beautiful and quirky picture book by Sophie Blackall that’s styled as a child’s letter to a visitor from outer space. “There are more than seven billion people on Earth,” the narrator explains. “You can’t see our thoughts, but sometimes we show our feelings on our faces.” The illustrations for these musings have all the humor and delicacy that make Ms. Blackall’s work so distinctive (see left): wry lines and marzipan hues in tableaux that abound in seek-and-find interest. With an innocent as narrator—“Some things are part of nature. Some things are made by people”—this open-hearted book exalts the commonplace, making ordinary things seem remarkable.<br />Rivers aren’t a big feature of the year’s best illustrated chapter books, but water, ice and snow do figure in “The Silver Arrow” (Little, Brown, 259 pages, $16.99), a sparkling fantasy adventure story by Lev Grossman, with pictures by Tracy Nishamura Bishop. When an 11-year-old girl receives the gift of a steam locomotive, she and her little brother soon find themselves thundering into the magical unknown. Become conductors, they acquire train carriages—some filled with books, some with candy—and punch the tickets of chatty animal passengers.  Jaunty and wise, “The Silver Arrow” makes for a particularly fine read-aloud.</td>

      <td>From far-flung worlds to an eerie setting close to home, our columnist picks this year’s stellar reading.</td>
      <td>For sci-fi fans of a certain age, nothing was more welcome in 2020 than Eric Flint and Dave Freer’s “The Shaman of Karres” (Baen, 292 pages, $25), the third sequel to James H. Schmitz’s “The Witches of Karres,” now 70 years old and still a candidate for the best space-opera ever. “Shaman” follows the adventures of the Leewit, the youngest of the witches, whirling through space with hapless Captain Pausert on the trail of a new alien threat, one worse than the Megair Cannibals or the nanite menace. This time it’s a strange creature with powers of mind control, so insidious the controlled don’t even notice. Pure fun from the past, with just a touch of satire, all updated and with added invention. Who can resist the Daal of Uldune, a six-clone hexaperson, who is also a ruthless tyrant trying to go straight? Until, that is, his chivalrous instincts are stimulated and the gloves come off.<br />Nostalgia of a different kind is invoked by Christina Henry’s “The Ghost Tree” (Berkley, 432 pages, $16). No star-jaunting here, instead the scenario is what Ray Bradbury used to call “October country”: midwest, small town, scent of leaves burning, perfect peace. But there’s a chill in the air, Halloween is coming on and the town has closed ranks around a deadly secret. Just like the faeries of ancient folktale, the inhabitants pay an annual toll of sacrifice, and no one must speak of it. Memory of the missing is wiped out—except in 14-year old Lauren, a prime target for whatever hides in the ghost tree. It’s grimmer than Grimm, with teenage angst and rebellion included.<br />Christopher Paolini’s “To Sleep in a Sea of Stars” (Tor, 878 pages, $29.99) is quite unaffected by the weight of the past. Mr. Paolini cares nothing for the impossibility of faster-than-light travel, and has a unified field theory to back him up. But if you venture to the stars, you must be ready for First Contact, and then First Combat, and then it’s Star Wars, with the Jellies and the Nightmares and the Old Ones all mixing in. Further complexity comes from the heroine Kira, who is no longer just human now that she’s made contact with an alien mind. Mr. Paolini develops his ideas outside the story in a number of appendices. Sci-fi has always loved what some call “paratext”: future histories and fake quotations tucked in around the sides so you can get information across without putting a drag on the story. Mr. Paolini has so many ideas, that’s what he has to do.<br />Star-hopping is great, but, realists will object, we haven’t so much as got a colony on the Moon yet. And, sci-fi fans will chorus, we darned well should have by now! In “The Relentless Moon” (Tor, 542 pages, $17.99), Mary Robinette Kowal imagines a world where we did indeed try a bit harder over the last 50 years, and did what we could have done. If, that is, we’d had the kick in the pants delivered by a major asteroid impact in Chesapeake Bay. Maybe that would have made us realize that here on Earth we’re living in a giant pinball game. So we could have trained some female astronauts, given NASA some common sense and taken care of the politics at home as well as the tech in space. Not that the tech is not a problem, as Ms. Kowal shows in this truly relentless exposition of how to promote, and also sabotage, the best-planned of lunar initiatives.<br />Heroic fantasy may be the favored genre these days, but urban fantasy still has a lot going for it. Richard Kadrey’s “Ballistic Kiss” (Harper Voyager, 349 pages, $28.99) continues the adventures of “Sandman Slim,” a private investigator of the supernatural, based in Los Angeles. In previous volumes Slim has served his time in Hell and even acted as a stand-in for Lucifer. But as he points out, surviving Hell is one thing, L.A. is another.</td>

Kate makes contact with Resistance operatives in a race to elude a German policeman tasked by the Führer himself with her swift capture.<br />“The Bramble and the Rose” (Norton, 198 pages, $25.95) is Tom Bouman’s third novel featuring rural Pennsylvania police officer Henry Farrell. An introspective loner, Henry approaches a personal and emotional epiphany after learning of a grisly crime: a headless corpse found in a forest. Was the victim, an out-of-town private eye, killed by a bear or a man? And what brought the victim to this neck of the woods? Henry teams up with Mary Weaver, a biologist, to hunt for a rogue animal who may or may not have acquired a taste for human flesh. “A man-killer isn’t stupid,” she explain. “It stalks its prey in absolute silence. . . . Most survivors never hear or see it . . . until it’s less than fifty feet away. And if it has a taste for man, harsh words won’t stop him.”<br />Cormoran Strike, the detective hero of an enjoyable series of books by Robert Galbraith (a pen name for J.K. Rowling), has his most complex adventure yet in “Troubled Blood” (Mulholland, 933 pages, $29). This hefty volume is stuffed with intrigue, surprise, action, violence, social comedy and romance: “value for money,” as the British say. It starts with a cold case: the disappearance some 40 years ago of a doctor whose daughter still wants to learn what happened. “The truth’s out there,” Strike promises. But time, fate and other folk seem to conspire against Strike and his business partner, Robin Ellacott. The ongoing dramas in the two investigators’ own families also threaten to lead them astray. But our pseudonymous author sorts everything out by the end with the skill of a world-class storyteller.<br />A cellphone swiped from a lawyer striding through New York’s Grand Central Terminal triggers the infernal plot-machine of Patrick Hoffman’s “Clean Hands” (Atlantic Monthly, 280 pages, $26). The phone is loaded with confidential information pertaining to a high-profile lawsuit between two banks. Getting the phone back is vital. But was the theft genuine? The lawyer’s boss calls on Valencia Walker, an ex-CIA case officer, to put out the blaze, but the blaze keeps spreading. Street-level crooks lead to smalltime hoods who point to bigger gangsters—all the way up the criminal food-chain to where everything must converge. “It just seems,” Valencia finally says, “like this might be one where it would be better if everybody would just stand down.” But is it too late for that?<br />Joe Ide’s novels about Isaiah “IQ” Quintabe, a young private investigator in East Long Beach, Calif., are among the most inventive and smartly written books in the genre. “Hi Five” (Mulholland, 341 pages, $27), IQ’s fourth case, is his most unpredictable yet. An illicit arms dealer hires him, under threat of breaking his violinist girlfriend’s fingers, to solve the murder of the crook’s daughter’s boyfriend, a killing for which the daughter stands accused. Complicating matters further, the daughter is a multiple personality; IQ must prove each of the defendant’s five “alters” innocent to save his girlfriend’s digits. All in a week’s work for this Holmesian avatar in a gritty Southern California suburb.</td>

      <td>The impulse to constantly check phone screens for bad news only got its name in the last few years</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />Of all the words that came to prominence in 2020, one that truly seems to capture the zeitgeist of our dreary times is “doomscrolling.”<br />If you’ve spent any time on social media this year, you know the feeling. As Wall Street Journal Personal Tech columnist Nicole Nguyendefined it back in June, “doomscrolling” refers to “spending inordinate amounts of time on devices poring over grim news.” The phenomenon became all too common when the coronavirus pandemic kept people cooped up, as so many of us obsessed over the endless stream of depressing updates.<br />Despite the pessimism that the word encapsulates, “doomscrolling” is a lexical success story. By year’s end, it merited mention in a report from Oxford Languages, the publisher of the Oxford English Dictionary, on how the pandemic has profoundly shaped the lexicon. “Doomscrolling,” the report said, “typified the realities of the new normal” and “expressed poignantly the language changes brought on by the pandemic.”<br />The portentous sound of the word may have heightened its impact, drawing on centuries-old connotations of the word “doom.” Derived from Old English “dom” meaning “judgment,” it has long fused with other words to make compounds like “doomsday” for the final reckoning in the Judeo-Christian tradition. In the mid-20th century, “doomsayer” emerged as a bleaker version of “soothsayer,” for one who predicts calamities. “Doomsaying” may have provided a kind of model for both “doomscrolling” and a related neologism, “doomsurfing.”</td>

      <td>Breaking up  Facebook Inc.  would be difficult and expensive, but not impossible, according to current and former employees along with tech-industry experts.<br />In separate antitrust lawsuits filed on Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of 46 state attorneys general said they would try to make Facebook divest itself of apps Instagram and WhatsApp if the company’s conduct is found to be illegal.<br />Should that push succeed, it would rank among the biggest breakups in corporate history alongside Standard Oil and  AT&T .  Yet a breakup would also be complex, requiring potentially years of engineering work on top of legal wrangling.<br />Months before the FTC suit, Facebook called divestment of the apps “a complete nonstarter” in a briefing document, saying that disentangling them would result in diminished products, weaker security for user data and billions of dollars in redundant spending.<br />In a memo sent to employees on Wednesday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the lawsuits would take years to play out, and said he believed the company would prevail in court.</td>

      <td>SÃO PAULO—Joseph Safra, a Lebanese-Brazilian billionaire who built an international financial empire and financed a hostile takeover of Chiquita Brands International that took the business world by surprise, died Thursday here in Brazil’s business capital. He was 82.<br />Mr. Safra, ranked by Forbes as Brazil’s richest man with an estimated net worth of $23.2 billion, died of natural causes at the Albert Einstein Hospital, according to Banco Safra, the bank he made into one of Latin America’s most prominent. He was heir to a banking empire that began financing camel caravans in the Middle East and grew into a transnational business that includes banking, bananas, real estate and other interests.<br />His banking influence spanned from Latin America’s largest economy to the U.S. and Europe. Though he was reserved and shunned the spotlight, Mr. Safra and his brothers, Edmond and Moise, were well known for having built up the Banco Safra, the Safra National Bank of New York and the J. Safra Sarasin Bank in Switzerland by catering to ultrarich clients and elite companies. Though discreet, the Safra family is credited with helping shape global banking.<br />“He was a great banker, a true entrepreneur who built the Safra Group in the world, achieving success for his seriousness and business vision,” a statement from the Safra Group, the financial conglomerate he controlled, said. “He was a great leader and very respected inside and outside the organization.”<br />Mr. Safra arrived in Brazil in his 20s, brought here with his brothers from Lebanon by his father, Jacob, who had opened a bank in Beirut. The arrival of the Sephardic-Jewish family came in the wake of World War II, at a time when Israel had been founded and persecution of Beirut’s Jews had flared.</td>

      <td>Nearly 200 people were killed and more than 6,000 injured in a massive explosion at the port in Beirut on Aug. 4, ravaging the heart of residential areas and the city’s vibrant commercial district. Dozens of people are unaccounted for. Here is what we know so far.<br />A giant explosion at a warehouse in the port sent a shock wave through east and downtown Beirut at about 6 p.m. local time on Aug. 4. Videos of the blast posted on social media showed smoke billowing from the warehouse on the waterfront before a massive explosion produced a dome-shaped cloud that engulfed large parts of central Beirut. The force of the blast did tremendous damage to the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby buildings. The homes of tens of thousands of people were damaged by the blast.<br />Authorities say the blast occurred when a fire at a warehouse—Hangar 12—on the city’s waterfront ignited a cache of ammonium nitrate, an explosive material that had been stored at the site for more than six years.<br />Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound most commonly used in fertilizers. It is also used to make explosives and was used in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.<br />The Lebanese government is facing questions about why the explosive chemicals were stored at the port. A judge leading an investigation into the blast has charged caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab and three former ministers with negligence in relation to the blast. Mr. Diab has denied any wrongdoing. The former ministers couldn’t be reached for comment. Many Lebanese blame years of poor governance and corruption by the entire ruling elite for the explosion.</td>

The goal of a Republican plan should be to provide any person who is sick or injured with the appropriate care in the appropriate setting at the appropriate time in the management of any illness or injury, with emphasis on preventing illness or injury whenever possible. This will take away the one central issue on which the Democrats have held the advantage, access to care.<br />Republicans favor a market solution to the vexing problem of health-care system reform but have been unable to articulate a simple, easily understandable vision to implement that solution.<br />The solution should be based on three principles:<br />1) Expand the choices. There are many different, imperfect ways to finance care and many different, imperfect ways to deliver care. Each has advantages and disadvantages. The Democrats argue for top-down central control of health care. Republicans recognize the potential of choice to create competition between imperfect mechanisms to drive down cost and drive up quality.<br />2) Give individuals the opportunity and the responsibility to choose and own their own plan with the periodic right to change if dissatisfied with the previous choice. Ownership of plan provides portability and eliminates the pre-existing condition dilemma.</td>

      <td>The record corporate borrowing boom fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pandemic response may be coming to an end. Wall Street bankers and investors are preparing for a sharp drop in corporate bond sales next year.<br />Companies with investment-grade credit ratings will likely issue $1.1 trillion of new bonds in 2021, a 32% reduction from this year, according to research by  Barclays  PLC. Many are flush with cash after borrowing to bolster their balance sheets through the pandemic’s economic shutdowns.<br />The anticipated decline becomes even sharper after accounting for expected debt repayments, which offset new bond sales. Analysts at  Bank of America Corp.  forecast that net new corporate bond issuance will be $63 billion next year. That would be the lowest total since the bank began tracking it in 2002.<br />The Fed has eased borrowing conditions throughout the pandemic by dropping interest rates near zero, saying it expects to keep them there for years, and by implementing other measures, such as buying corporate bonds for the first time. The efforts have helped keep the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below 1% for months. It settled Thursday at 0.907%, according to Tradeweb.<br />A steep decline in bond borrowing would be a sign that corporate chieftains feel less need to buffer balance sheets and that they will be spending some of the $2.1 trillion amassed earlier this year. For portfolio managers, it would be a mixed blessing: A declining supply of new bonds would drive up prices of those investors already own, but make it tougher to find new securities to buy with the cash that continues to pour into bond funds.</td>

Donald Trump and Senate Republicans increased the debt by $6.7 trillion over the last four years. To put that in perspective, the Obama administration increased the debt by $8.6 trillion over eight years. In real dollar terms, the last four years saw the greatest spending increase in U.S. history. In other words, apart from perhaps Rand Paul, the redistributionists on the right long ago lost the ability to cry foul over spending.<br />Matt Elbert<br />Houston</td>

      <td>Amazon . com Inc. announced an effort Thursday aimed at helping 29 million people world-wide retrain by 2025, giving them new skills for cloud-computing roles as the pandemic upends many careers.<br />The online giant committed $700 million last year to reskilling 100,000 of its own workers in the U.S. The new effort will build on existing programs and include new ones in partnership with nonprofits, schools and others.<br />Amazon’s latest initiative is geared toward those who aren’t already employed at the company. The idea, it says, is to equip people with the education needed to work in cloud-computing at a number of employers seeking to fill high-tech positions. While some participants might find jobs at Amazon, it is more likely they would get hired at other companies, including many that use Amazon Web Services, the online retailer’s cloud division.<br />The free training could support those looking to prepare for entry-level support positions or in helping existing engineers broaden their expertise in areas like machine learning or cybersecurity, the company says.<br />Teresa Carlson, a vice president at Amazon Web Services, says the company hears almost daily from its clients that they can’t find the right people to fill technical jobs as many organizations move their applications and processes to the cloud.</td>

      <td>President Trump and his supporters have pinned their hopes of reversing President-elect Joe Biden’s victory on a lawsuit filed by the Republican Texas attorney general that election-law specialists say has almost no chance of success.<br />The suit, filed on behalf of the state of Texas and joined by Mr. Trump personally and 17 Republican-leaning states, asks the Supreme Court to block Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin from casting electoral votes on Dec. 14 for Mr. Biden after he won their popular vote counts in the Nov. 3 election.<br />The court gave those four states until 3 p.m. Thursday to file arguments against Texas’s request. A decision about whether to hear the case likely will follow as soon as Thursday afternoon or Friday.<br />In the filing, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accuses the four states of “rampant lawlessness,” claiming they violated their own election laws when officials adjusted voting procedures to process mail-in ballots, which millions of voters employed to comply with public-health guidance to reduce transmission of Covid-19. Texas contends that in making such accommodations, the states violated federal constitutional provisions that direct state legislatures to determine the “manner” of appointing electors.<br />Mr. Trump called the lawsuit “the big one” in a tweet Wednesday. “The Supreme Court has a chance to save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States,” the president tweeted Thursday.</td>

Mr. Johnson’s public pessimism and the EU contingency plans laid out Thursday reflect a mutual assessment that an accord might not be reached in time.<br />In a video clip issued by his office Thursday, Mr. Johnson indicated there was a good chance the negotiations would fail. “We need to be very, very clear there is now a strong possibility—a strong possibility—that we will have a solution that’s more like an Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU,” Mr. Johnson said.<br />An Australian relationship is the term the British government has increasingly used to describe the two sides trading with no trade agreement but under terms laid out by the World Trade Organization. That would impose customs duties on goods such as food, clothing and cars that have traded tariff-free between the U.K. and the EU since 1973.</td>

Nearly all the equipment he needed fit neatly into a couple of rolling cases. “It’s a reminder that you don’t need all that stuff,” he said. “If you have a story and you have good actors, with the technology now you can make something that looks amazing for nothing.”<br />Here, the director talks film homework and the price of making movies.<br />What I look for as a filmmaker is: freedom and momentum. Shooting on an iPhone gave me that. I wanted the ability to put a lens anywhere in seconds. I like that on “Unsane” and “Highflying Bird” our entire camera department fit in a backpack, that feeling of being an amateur.</td>

While Brent started the year above $65, its recent rally shows how hopes for coronavirus-vaccine distribution and economic-stimulus programs are helping to heal global energy markets.<br />Oil has risen in tandem with stocks and other commodities in recent weeks, part of a broad market rally fueled by investors’ anticipation for a 2021 global economic resurgence. Buoyant demand from China also is boosting oil prices after the world’s largest commodity consumer largely contained the pandemic.<br />Traders are now hoping that travel picks up in the U.S. and Europe next year, boosting energy consumption while large suppliers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries remain disciplined with production cuts.<br />OPEC and allies including Russia agreed to modest output increases last week, instilling faith that the group won’t bring back supply too quickly and adding momentum to the oil-price rally. Recent gains come despite a recent surge in coronavirus cases around the world and data showing a drop-off in U.S. fuel demand, showing how investors are looking past those concerns and instead focusing on vaccine hopes.</td>

      <td>George Clooney directs and stars in this post-apocalypic saga that intertwines the stories of an Arctic researcher, returning astronauts, and a mysterious little girl.</td>
      <td>Toward the end of “The Midnight Sky”—a haunting post-apocalyptic adventure starring George Clooney, who directed, and Felicity Jones—astronauts aboard a space ship that’s been forced to change course discuss using the slingshot effect, getting a boost in velocity from the gravitational field of a planet, in this case Earth. The film, showing in select theaters before its debut on Netflix later this month, gets a boost from the gravity of Earth’s plight. In the past it was easier to see end-of-civilization sagas as entertainment. Now, at a time when the United Nations secretary-general has called the state of our planet “broken,” a movie like this one hits closer to home. That’s not to suggest it is nothing more than a cautionary tale. Mr. Clooney and his colleagues have crafted an elegant screen version of a novel by Lily Brooks-Dalton with a resonant performance at its center—his own.<br />He plays Augustine, an aging scientist and the last person left at an Arctic observatory after a catastrophe, described only as “a mistake,” has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. Grievously ill and dependent on blood transfusions that he manages himself, he turns down an offer of evacuation in order to face his solitary fate. But Augustine’s isolation doesn’t last. He’s jolted by a status-board notification of the astronauts’ impending return from deep space; they’ve been away for two years, exploring a planet for possible colonization, and have no idea what has happened at home. Then he’s startled by the sudden appearance, right there in the observatory kitchen, of a little girl in a yellow dress and sneakers. (She’s played delightfully by Caoillin Springall, who was only 6 years old at the time of production.) Who is she? Was she left behind by evacuees? Impossible to know, because she doesn’t speak, and no way to ask, since all communications are down.<br />Solitude—existential and seemingly implacable—provides the film’s theme; the urgent human need to break out of it provides the action. The astronauts, including Ms. Jones’s Sully and David Oyelowo’s Adewole, the mission commander, don’t understand why they can’t reach mission control or anyone else on Earth. Augustine can’t tell them what happened, let alone warn them off. When a radio link is finally established it quickly fails, prompting the scientist to embark—yes, with the little girl bundled up in a parka—on a perilous trek to another Arctic station with a stronger transmitter.<br />That’s the most suspenseful part of the film, but also the most conventional, a sort of “Revenant Redux.” (No accident, since the screenplay was written by Mark L. Smith, who adapted “The Revenant” with its director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu; Mr. Smith’s adaptation here is, in the main, astute and admirably spare.) The most affecting part is Augustine’s reaching out to the space ship, with its precious human cargo. He’s had one quasi-fatherhood thrust upon him by the mysterious child, who draws a flower to tell him that her name is Iris; another father-daughter relationship is implicit in his desperate concern for Sully, whose fate becomes intertwined with his own.<br />Seeing Mr. Clooney in the role is a shock. Gone is the jauntily handsome figure we’re accustomed to. Augustine is weary, frightened, regretful of a loveless past evoked in flashback, and just plain old, with a beard so luxuriant it looks animated. He is also, now and then, warm and funny. It won’t give away too much to tell you that Augustine and Iris can’t connect fully until, sharing a wordless dinner that includes potatoes and green peas, they line up their peas on the table, then flick them at each other like kids shooting marbles.</td>

More affluent Americans are doing well, while millions of others—including lower-paid workers in vulnerable jobs in retailing and restaurants—are seeing their incomes and net worth decline.<br />“We’ve seen home prices rise, market prices for tradable instruments rise and savings increase because people haven’t been able to spend money on everything from sporting events to weddings,” said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG LLP. “But those gains skew to upper income people.”</td>

      <td>In Will Arbery’s singular, sympathetic play, young conservative intellectuals gather to discuss their post-graduate lives and political concerns in the age of Trump.</td>
      <td>Will Arbery’s “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” was one of the most talked-about plays of 2019, and I fully intended to review Playwrights Horizons’ New York premiere in this space. Unfortunately, a family crisis made it impossible for me to do so, and the coming of the pandemic subsequently prevented regional theaters from taking up the play. I’ve been crossing my fingers ever since that somebody out there would mount a webcast version. Now Philadelphia’s Wilma Theater, one of the East Coast’s leading drama companies, has taped a fully staged site-specific production of “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” at a private location in the Poconos, turning the cast and crew into a closed quarantine “bubble” so that they could work together face-to-face instead of taping their performances separately via Zoom or green screens. The result, which looks more like a small-scale movie than an online webcast of a stage show, is a flawless, impressively well-cast production of a work of singular distinction, one for which the word “remarkable” is, if anything, an understatement.<br />The play, directed by Blanka Zizka, is set in rural Wyoming in 2017. It centers on Emily (Campbell O’Hare), Kevin (Justin Jain) and Teresa (Sarah Gliko), who are in their mid-to-late 20s and are meeting at the off-the-grid shack of Justin (Jered McLenigan), a somewhat older but like-minded man. The young people are all in the familiar process of discovering themselves, but there is nothing else ordinary about them: They are conservative Catholic intellectuals-in-the-making who have been girding themselves for battle in the coming culture wars.<br />Kevin and Teresa went to the same school, Transfiguration College, and have come to Justin’s house to meet with Gina (Mary Elizabeth Scallen), Emily’s mother and Transfiguration’s incoming president, and tell her about their post-graduate lives in the age of Trump. Like them, Transfiguration is very unusual, a school where, as Teresa says, “you got wilderness training, where you spoke conversational Latin and locked your phone in a safe for four years.” Not surprisingly, it produces alumni who make casual mention in bull sessions of Martin Heidegger and “my gal Flannery O” (that’s O’Connor to you), ask each other questions like “How’s your soul? Is it in peril?” and believe it to be the destiny of those unwilling to do battle with the rise of postmodern secularism to degenerate into “a throbbing mass of genderless narcissists….Everyone working for any business or public school will be frog-marched through diversity and inclusion training. It won’t just be about tolerating, which we do, it will be about affirming their disorder. Which is a sin.” Notwithstanding their avowed religious conservatism, though, the characters have mostly come to view Donald Trump with skepticism, even though they all supported him in 2016, albeit unenthusiastically (“After I voted for Trump I vomited next to my car”).<br />Part of what makes Mr. Arbery’s play so good is that its characters are portrayed on their own terms. No one shows up at evening’s end to make these-people-are-100%-evil noises meant to calm the horrified audience. (I would love to know what Tony Kushner, a wholly different kind of playwright but one from whom Mr. Arbery appears to have learned valuable lessons, made of it.) While I feel sure that many of those who saw “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” in New York found the characters, not entirely without reason, to be potentially dangerous extremists, they are far more complicated and interesting than that, for life in urban America has nibbled away at their orthodoxies, and none of them now takes the carved-in-stone truths of Transfiguration College at face value. Not at all surprisingly, Mr. Arbery grew up in the kind of cultural environment he describes here, which makes it possible for him to portray it with the deep comprehension and distanced sympathy that give “Heroes” its dramatic power.<br />“Heroes” is a conversation piece that runs for 2 1/2 hours, and those with no appetite for intellectual talk will doubtless find it far too long. But it is a real play, not a pretentious gabfest, and Mr. Arbery is a greatly talented writer who has given us a drama as exciting and challenging—nay, daring—as any new play I’ve ever reviewed. I intend to see “Heroes” onstage as soon as the pandemic ends and it starts to be produced by regional theaters. Don’t wait for that, though: This is a play you must see, right now.</td>

A person familiar with Mr. Tarbert’s plans said he would retain his seat until he decides on his next move. His term expires in 2024.<br />That means Republicans will keep their 3-2 majority at the CFTC, possibly until 2022.<br />Republican commissioner Brian Quintenz hasn’t said when he plans to depart and is legally allowed to remain in the role until Jan. 3, 2022, according to a CFTC official.<br />Mr. Biden will likely appoint one of the commission’s two sitting Democrats—Dan Berkovitz or Rostin Behnam—as acting chairman while the Senate mulls an eventual nominee. But a Democratic chairman’s ability to pass tougher rules on banks, clearinghouses or derivatives traders would be held in check by the need to get at least one Republican vote.</td>

Federal employees must generally preserve documents under the Federal Records Act.<br />Dr. Kent stated that she didn’t speak directly to Dr. Redfield about this instruction, but was informed that it came from him, explaining, “that’s what I understood, that it came from Dr. Redfield,” according to the letter. She said she looked for the email after she had been told to delete it, but that it was already deleted. She said she didn’t know who had deleted it.</td>

      <td>Steven Soderbergh’s microbudget, improvised comedy about old friends reuniting on a trans-Atlantic cruise stars Meryl Streep, Candice Bergen and Dianne Wiest.</td>
      <td>Making a studio feature can be arduous— relentless pressure, constant script revisions, the deployment of vast technical resources, the tyranny of marketing strategies. Any actor who values artistic freedom would jump at the chance to make a movie almost spontaneously, which is the way the HBO Max comedy “Let Them All Talk” was made, and to make it with Steven Soderbergh, a filmmaker with a special affinity for directing actors. And look who did jump: Meryl Streep, Candice Bergen and Dianne Wiest, three legends of our time. Mr. Soderbergh, serving as his own cinematographer, shot the film in two weeks on a microbudget; the main location was the luxury liner Queen Mary 2 during a trans-Atlantic crossing So how did such an adventurous production turn out? Not very well, though it’s certainly a curiosity, a chance to see what happens when superb performers improvise their lines in the absence of a conventional script.<br />Ms. Streep is Alice Hughes, a celebrated, and famously secretive, novelist who has just received a prestigious literary prize. But she’s in New York, the award ceremony will be in England, and she doesn’t fly. The problem is on its way to being solved when one of her agents, Karen (Gemma Chan), suggests that the Cunard Line might offer complimentary passage to Alice, and perhaps to several companions of her choice. (Unlikely? Hey, it’s a movie.) Seeing an occasion for some serious freeloading, Alice invites her nephew, Tyler (Lucas Hedges), and two college friends she hasn’t seen for at least 30 years—Ms. Wiest’s Susan, who advocates for incarcerated women, and Ms. Bergen’s Roberta, who sells brassieres in a department store. Thus is the stage set for a reunion, presumably fond, and for the trio to take stock of how far they’ve come in their mortal journeys and where they still hope to go.<br />How you feel about the film depends on how much sense you want it to make. What’s there for ready enjoyment is the spectacle of three women, no longer young, dishing about their lives and loves. There’s also a subplot involving Tyler and Karen, who has booked her own passage to spy on Alice and find out more about the novel she’s currently writing. (Fuzzy or improbable? Hey, it’s still a movie.) And at the center of it all is Ms. Streep’s literary lioness, at once witty, petty, vain, vulnerable, mercurial, manipulative and wise.<br />Those adjectives, though, are listed in no particular order of importance because it’s impossible to know who Alice really is in her heart of hearts, despite Ms. Streep’s beguiling efforts to sketch her in. And sketchiness is the film’s dominant quality because of how the story evolved. The writer and actress Deborah Eisenberg provided an outline, rather than a formal script, and discussed scenes with the actors during production as they improvised their dialogue.<br />Mr. Soderbergh, who directed one of my favorite films, “Out of Sight” (from Scott Frank’s brilliant screen adaptation of a terrific Elmore Leonard novel, I should add), has made a number of features, with varying success, that were partly or wholly improvised. This one, though, feels flat and slack, with scenes that drift off oddly, or aren’t there at all.</td>

      <td>Conflicts over political power and indigenous rights lie at the center of Sundance Now’s new drama.</td>
      <td>The physical and social backgrounds essential to this dark political tale exert their powers early. “Total Control” (begins Thursday, Dec. 17, Sundance Now) is a six-part drama set in the Australian Outback. A place, we’re shown, where people spend their days swatting at the flies circling their heads, and where conversation is dry and to the point, and jokey, though without cruelty. It’s the way of this society to be wary of strangers but not impossibly so, as one government representative discovers in episode 1, when he comes knocking on the door of a house in the small town of Winton. He’s met with suspicion by the woman who opens it—she quickly decides he’s a Mormon, seeking converts, and informs him that he’s wasting his time.<br />Still he’s invited in. The visitor explains that he’s looking for the woman’s daughter, who isn’t home yet, he’s informed. And so the two wait for her together. The visitor, who’s been supplied with tea and cookies, looks approvingly at the array of pictures on the wall, among them that of the queen.<br />“Ninety-three years old and never missed a day of work—now you show me someone else who will give that kind of service,” the lady of the house declares. Her visitor beams—he’s a massive fan of the queen, he informs her. The walls of this modest home are filled with mementos, testaments to experience, to memories, to a life lived. This scene—which comes less than five minutes after the horrifying dramatics of the show’s opening segment—is the first indicator that this series has something more on its mind than heroics and high principles. Something, for example, like recognizably human characters: for right here is a woman who clearly belongs in exactly such a category.<br />The lady of this house is Jan Irving (a memorable performance by Trisha Morton-Thomas), a member of Australia’s indigenous community, whose daughter is Alexandra Irving (Deborah Mailman), one of the two female characters at the heart of this tale. A place, it’s soon clear, that threatens to grow ever more crowded as the show’s various plot lines weave their way through the action, the most important of which concern Prime Minister Rachel Anderson (an elegant and persuasive Rachel Griffiths) and Alexandra. Another character shows up only briefly, but in the most haunting way—a young woman, alone, making her way in the dark through that vast lonely territory with just a knapsack. Where is she going, this young native woman who appears and disappears? She’s clearly an escapee from detention, a girl who carries with her the filmed evidence of guards administering a lethal punishment to her friend, another Aboriginal girl.<br />But the series amounts to far more than a catalog of injustices. (It was written by Stuart Page, Darren Dale, Ms. Griffiths and Miranda Dear. Director, Rachel Perkins.) It’s an enterprise mightily enlarged by its merciless focus on political combat, its depiction of longtime trusted alliances—they can die overnight, given the right impetus—its biting vision of the prevailing codes, and what passes for right and wrong in political society.</td>

      <td>Victor Kossakovsky’s documentary takes a sow as its subject to tell the story of agriculture and industrial farming.</td>
      <td>The star of Victor Kossakovsky’s “Gunda” is a pig. Gunda is her name, and lactating is her game; she’s a mammary mountain with what I counted to be 10 piglets on her slope. I had time to count piglets, and reflect on their lives and fate, because time flows slowly in this one-of-a-kind documentary feature, shot in luminous, almost magical-realist, black and white. It would flow at a turtle’s pace if the cast included turtles, but there’s only Gunda and her brood, plus a one-legged chicken who hops around a field with surprising grace and a small herd of cows, seemingly happy—or at least not unhappy—to be standing or sitting in the rain. These creatures are in no rush either. Watching them, you get some sense of their life rhythms while readjusting your own.<br />Last year I wrote about the vivid, almost hallucinatory images in Mr. Kossakovsky’s “Aquarela,” a documentary about water in all its power and various forms. Now he has turned his camera on the residents of a pigsty and the farm that surrounds it. (Actually filming took place on several farms and sanctuaries in Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom.) The filmmaker has a great gift for helping us to see, assuming that we’re willing to stick with a 93-minute film with no plot and no dialogue, only the presence of animals we’re accustomed to seeing as cute characters in commercial entertainments. (Think “Babe,” which I loved, or countless docs about pandas and penguins.)<br />The invisible element in “Gunda” is time, the unstated subject is the life these animals live—as individuals, not just animate objects—and the industrial processes that kill them. Mr. Kossakovsky’s film is ultimately political, a quiet polemic, even though the killing takes place offscreen; all we see is what Gunda sees, that one moment her piglets are there and the next moment they are gone. Pigs are smart. She’s surely aware that something terrible has happened. An improbably beautiful work of barnyard art, “Gunda” figures that we’re smart too.</td>

That unwillingness to talk left unresolved many conflicting accounts of how the VA secretary and his deputies dealt with the matter, according to the report.<br />“Our investigation found that Secretary Wilkie and other VA officials disparaged the veteran who filed the sexual-assault complaint,” said VA Inspector General Michael Missal. “The tone set by Secretary Wilkie was at minimum unprofessional and at worst provided the basis for VA leaders’ attempts to undermine the veteran’s credibility.”<br />Mr. Wilkie denied wrongdoing and said the inspector general’s investigation itself is unfounded. “After nearly a year of investigation, interviews with 65 people and analysis of nearly 1.5 million documents, VA’s inspector general cannot substantiate that I sought to investigate or asked others to investigate the veteran,” Mr. Wilkie said in a statement. “That’s because these allegations are false.”</td>

Angus King (I., Maine) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) were working on hammering out a deal on some form of limited protections, but it wasn’t clear how much GOP support their idea would draw, aides said.<br />For weeks, lawmakers have operated under the principle that any relief package would need to include some form of liability protections, long a top priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), as well as additional funding for state and local governments, a key condition of Democrats.<br />That pairing came into question this week. First, Mr. McConnell suggested dropping both measures from this package. Democrats rejected that tradeoff, arguing that liability protection wasn’t as urgent as aid to states and localities whose revenues have been hammered by the pandemic.</td>

      <td>The U.S. budget deficit widened 25% in October and November from the same period last year to $429 billion, a record for the first two months of the fiscal year, the Treasury Department said Thursday.<br />Higher spending and shrinking revenue tied to the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic downturn pushed the deficit higher. Federal spending rose 9% to $887 billion during October and November from the same period a year earlier, while revenue declined 3% to $457 billion.<br />The Treasury said the deficit would have been even wider if not for calendar quirks that moved up the timing of certain benefit payments. If not for those timing issues, the deficit in October and November would have risen 47% from the same period a year earlier.<br />Higher spending to combat the coronavirus was driven largely by increases on safety-net programs. Spending by the Agriculture Department, which administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, rose 36%, while spending on Medicaid increased 16%. Labor Department spending on jobless benefits rose to $45.1 billion in October and November, compared with $3.7 billion during the same period a year earlier.<br />Federal tax revenue declined largely as a result of lower individual income tax withholding, which senior Treasury officials attributed to high levels of unemployment tied to the pandemic, and deferred payroll taxes the government authorized through the end of this calendar year. Individual withholding was down 4% in the first two months of the fiscal year, which started on Oct. 1.</td>

      <td>The pop star’s ninth studio album, due at midnight Friday, is her second surprise release of 2020</td>
      <td>For Taylor Swift fans, Christmas is coming early: Ms. Swift on Thursday announced her ninth studio album, “Evermore,” which is the second unexpected release of the year for one of music’s most notoriously meticulous pop stars.<br />Released just five months after her intimate Grammy-nominated blockbuster “Folklore,” the new album, which Ms. Swift describes as “folklore’s sister record,” features many of the same collaborators, including The National’s Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff and Bon Iver. That continuity suggests a collection of “Folklore” leftovers and more songs written in a similarly hushed and folksy indie-rock vein.<br />“I’ve never done this before,” Ms. Swift said on social media. “In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore.”<br />“I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales,” she continued. “So I just kept writing them.”<br />The quick arrival of “Evermore” reflects a reality of today’s streaming-music economy: More is more. Like fellow pop star Ariana Grande, Ms. Swift has pivoted from carefully plotted-out releases to more spontaneous and less precious ones—borrowing from the playbook of hip-hop & R&B stars.</td>

Mr. Trump’s alleged offense was suggesting that a foreign government look into Hunter Biden dealings which any reasonable person would say deserved examination.

But it signifies further momentum for bitcoin, which has surged this fall. The price of a single bitcoin peaked in late November at $19,835, topping its 2017 high, and currently trades around $18,000, up 150% year-to-date.<br />MassMutual purchased the bitcoin through a New York-based fund management company called NYDIG, which has about $2.3 billion of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under management. MassMutual also acquired a $5 million minority equity stake in NYDIG, which was formerly known as New York Digital Investment Group.<br />The insurance company, founded in 1851, said the bitcoin investment was based on a broad strategy to take advantage of new opportunities while remaining diversified, “giving us measured yet meaningful exposure to a growing economic aspect of our increasingly digital world.”<br />Bitcoin, launched in January 2009, is a software program that operates across a network of linked but independent computers. It allows any two people to exchange value directly without the use of a middleman like a bank.</td>

      <td>Regulator says it isn’t necessary to extend precautionary action taken as the pandemic began</td>
      <td>U.K. banks can resume paying dividends next year after regulators ended a ban introduced in March to make lenders conserve capital during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The share prices of Britain’s biggest banks have been battered this year as they set aside billions of pounds in provisions for bad loans and curbed payouts to shareholders. Industry leaders including  Barclays  PLC Chief Executive Jes Staley and Santander Chairman Ana Botín in recent months urged regulators to allow them to start paying dividends again.<br />“An extension of the exceptional and precautionary action taken in March is not necessary,” the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority, or PRA, said in a written statement Thursday. “Any distributions should be prudent, reflecting the still elevated levels of economic uncertainty.”<br />Canceling dividends helped banks to shore up their balance sheets. The capital ratios of the U.K.’s biggest banks improved in the first half of 2020 even though they were hit with £18 billion, equivalent to $24 billion, of impairment losses, the Bank of England has said. The European Central Bank also asked banks to stop paying dividends earlier this year.<br />The dividend cancellations displeased many shareholders—particularly Hong Kong-based investors in  HSBC .  The London-based bank, which makes most of its profit in Asia, said in August that it faced lawsuits in connection with dividend cancellations.</td>

      <td>For five decades, under two very different regimes, Tehran has built up the infrastructure for a bomb but stopped short of making one</td>
      <td>Iran’s nuclear ambitions are again looming over a new American administration. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to resuscitate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that President Trump unilaterally discarded. But after four years of enduring sanctions and targeted assassinations, the Islamic Republic may no longer be listening. Some experts fear that Iran’s pragmatists—led by President Hassan Rouhani, who negotiated the nuclear agreement—have been discredited and that Iran’s hard-liners are too suspicious of the West to reengage with another American leader.<br />As usual, the debate in Washington misreads the realities in Tehran. For the past five decades, under two very different regimes, Iran has pursued essentially the same nuclear strategy. While many Westerners fret over the tussling between Iran’s moderates and hard-liners, the most striking aspect of Iran’s nuclear-arms policy over the decades is its consistency. Mr. Biden is trying to return to diplomacy at the precise time when significant arms-control breakthroughs are all but impossible.<br />Iran’s nuclear program ramped up in earnest during the 1970s, when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi concluded that his ambitions to dominate the region might require the ultimate weapon. In 1975, the shah told the  New York Times  that while he wasn’t seeking the bomb, “if 20 or 30 ridiculous little countries are going to develop nuclear weapons, then I may have to revise my policies.” In his chatty way, the shah was hinting at a nuclear hedging strategy: Iran would build a sophisticated nuclear infrastructure but defer assembling a bomb, depending on events in its dangerous neighborhood.<br />In 1979, Islamist revolutionaries overthrew the shah. The new theocracy destroyed much of the old order but proved protective of its nuclear inheritance. The Middle East was still a disorderly region, and the revolutionaries were as much Persian chauvinists as the monarch they overthrew.<br />Iran’s new clerical oligarchs never made nuclear ambitions a matter of factional dispute. The reformist President Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005) was as committed to the nuclear program as his reactionary successor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-13). Under the watchful eye of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the nuclear program didn’t fall prey to Iran’s poisonous domestic politics.</td>

On Thursday, Team USA signaled that it believes such a punishment shouldn’t happen again.<br />The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, backing the recommendations of a council on racial and social justice it helped form earlier this year, called for an end to the International Olympic Committee rule that prohibits protest at Olympic sites and venues.<br />“The USOPC values the voices of Team USA athletes and believes that their right to advocate for racial and social justice, and be a positive force for change, absolutely aligns with the fundamental values of equality that define Team USA and the Olympic and Paralympic movements,” USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland said. Team USA won’t sanction athletes for protesting at the Games in support of those causes, it said.<br />The announcement sets up a showdown ahead of next summer’s Tokyo Games between the world’s most powerful Olympic nation and the IOC, which has resisted relaxing protest rules on the biggest Olympic stages.<br />The IOC responded to a request for comment by sharing a statement from Kirsty Coventry, chair of the IOC Athletes’ Commission. She said the commission would consider the U.S. feedback and that of other nations’ athletes before providing recommendations to the IOC Executive Board. So far, the majority of athletes have said they want to preserve the Olympic podium and field of play, Coventry said.</td>

      <td>A Chinese briefing sparked news stories, but Canada says the status of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor is unchanged</td>
      <td>OTTAWA—Canada said Thursday that two of its citizens held in China for two years haven’t been tried after news outlets interpreted a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry to the contrary, highlighting the lack of transparency around the two men’s cases.<br />Thursday marks the second anniversary of China’s detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor within hours of each other in two Chinese cities, nine days after Canadian authorities arrested Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou at the behest of the U.S.—an incident that has embroiled Canada in a broader diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.<br />On Thursday, multiple media outlets reported that Messrs. Kovrig and Spavor, who were later indicted on espionage charges, had stood trial. The reports cited a statement from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, who said in a regular briefing that Chinese authorities had “carried out the arrest, indictment and trial” of the two Canadians, according to the Chinese transcript of the briefing posted on the ministry’s website.<br />The English transcript of the briefing, posted some time after the Chinese on Thursday, says the two Canadians “were arrested, prosecuted and will be tried.”<br />According to a spokeswoman from Canada’s Foreign Department, there has been “no development” in the two Canadians’ cases. The spokeswoman said that Canadian officials in Beijing spoke directly with the Chinese Foreign Ministry and said the confusion was the result of an “inaccurate characterization” of the process.</td>

      <td>These purveyors’ websites will deliver restaurant-quality seafood direct to the rest of us</td>
      <td>THERE’S NEVER been a better time to buy seafood online. With the crushing impact of the pandemic on the hospitality industry, seafood purveyors that once counted on wholesale business to restaurants and hotels have pivoted to direct-to-consumer online retail.<br />“It’s been survival mode,” said Peter Jarvis, president, CEO and chief fishmonger of Peter’s Florida Seafood. His company relied primarily on wholesale for 30 years, up until March of this year. Wholesale business in 2020 is still down by about 75% from what it was by this time last year, but online-retail sales of Florida stone crab claws and other fish caught in the state’s coastal waters have kept Mr. Jarvis in business and customers happy. “People are excited to get chef-quality seafood on a consistent basis, and it means a lot because they aren’t going out,” Mr. Jarvis said.<br />At Island Creek Oysters in Massachusetts, president Chris Sherman said, “We lost 98% of our core revenue overnight, which was selling oysters directly to top chefs around the country.” While Island Creek has run an online-retail operation as well for the last decade, “there were some years when it didn’t make sense to keep it going.” Beginning in March, that changed: “Within weeks of the shutdown, that [retail] part of the business really sprang to life.”<br />The companies below provide access to pristine seafood you would otherwise have to visit a restaurant to get. They’re transparent about their sourcing and vigilant about maintaining sustainable fisheries—though the profusion of packaging required to keep seafood cold and fresh in transit can be daunting to eco-conscious consumers. Whether stocking up for a holiday celebration or with an eye to healthier, omega-3-packed eating in the new year, cast your line here.<br />This outfit offers monthly subscription plans with choices of salmon, white fish (such as halibut and cod), or a combination. All seafood is wild-caught sustainably in Alaska, flash frozen and packed in coolers with dry ice. Active members have access to special offerings including Dungeness and snow crab, which come broken down and pre-cooked for easy prep; Alaska’s cold waters make for highly flavorful and subtly sweeter meat. And the sablefish is exceptionally buttery. Monthly plans are easy to set-up thanks to a straightforward website and start at $132 for a 12-pack of 6-ounce portions. wildalaskancompany.com</td>

      <td>Investors shrugging off government’s lawsuits might be missing the bigger picture</td>
      <td>Don’t scroll past  Facebook ’s  latest bit of melodrama.<br />On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission and 46 states sued the social-media company over anticompetitive practices, seeking to force the world’s largest social network to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook arguably has been in lawmakers’ sights since the contentious 2016 presidential election, and the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 certainly didn’t help matters. After years of threats, investors seemed to view the main event as almost anticlimactic, skeptical that such lawsuits will amount to any material change in the near term. Shares of Facebook were down less than 2%, on pace with a selloff affecting big tech peers on Wednesday, with an even more muted drop on Thursday.<br />While all large tech companies face pressure from regulators, Facebook seems to be the easiest target given its structure as three distinct apps. But investors’ doubts about the feasibility of a breakup certainly have merit. Both of Facebook’s acquisitions, for instance, were approved by the FTC itself, and proving that competitors and consumers were harmed, as the suits say, won’t be easy. If anything, the cases will likely take years to resolve.<br />But that doesn’t mean Facebook will skate by in the meantime. The company, which has made its fortune by spending big money to make big money, needs to prove out a fresh strategy to keep growing.<br />Facebook’s advertising business, which still accounted for nearly 99% of its overall revenue in the third quarter, appears to be reaching a saturation point. Ads served on its platform have been increasing by a quarterly average of almost 30% year on year for at least the last five years. Filling its acquired Instagram with them has contributed to that growth, first on the main feed and more recently in the app’s Stories feature. In some cases, users are seeing more ads than the new content they came to the app for. With other social platforms such as Tik Tok, Snapchat and  Pinterest  gaining traction, Facebook already walks a fine line between engaging its users and annoying them.</td>

      <td>There’s no substitute for finding candidates who capture voters’ hearts. No, not even a 30-point plan.</td>
      <td>It is tempting to treat elections as math problems, while ignoring the art required to assemble winning coalitions. Pollsters sort data along demographic groupings, data analysts dissect precinct-level trends, and ad makers consult focus groups to craft appealing messages. The result is policies designed to appeal to enough voters to win, presented by disciplined politicians in sound bites that are repeated relentlessly.<br />To win a primary, policies must appeal to chronic voters with strong single-issue preferences without turning off enough swing voters to lose the general election. Conservatives have to appeal to gun owners and evangelicals to win the primary, but take care not to alienate socially moderate suburban voters in the process. Liberals have to appeal to teacher unions, global-warming activists, pro-choice feminists and minorities to win the primary, but avoid losing fiscally moderate suburban voters in the general. This mechanical, calculating approach to politics is one reason voters discount political promises and the politicians who make them.<br />Donald Trump upended all this. He doesn’t carefully tailor his message or stick to tested and approved sound bites. His more straightforward, undisciplined approach elicits a visceral reaction from voters. Mr. Trump’s supporters are famously loyal, and his opponents suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. Nobody is ambivalent about the president. He has his base’s trust precisely because he isn’t judicious with his words. While they often cringe at his demeanor, they trust him to say what he thinks.<br />Mr. Trump isn’t unique in harnessing his emotional connection with voters to create a durable bond. Policy has always been necessary but insufficient in politics. People vote in large part based on feelings, in addition to policy views. Mr. Trump gives his supporters permission to believe in America and be proudly patriotic. The working-class voters who form his base cheer his opposition to unfair trade deals and liberal immigration policies that they think threaten their jobs, but also adore him for his willingness to fight the elites that look down on them and him. Similarly, there are people who prefer Mr. Trump’s fiscal policies, but voted for Joe Biden because the president made their hearts recoil.<br />Liberals have long contended that conservatives use emotional appeals to manipulate working-class voters into voting against their own economic interests. These appeals, supposedly grounded in patriotic, faith-based or racist rhetoric, are held to fool voters into supporting Republicans who do the bidding of the rich. How else can Democrats explain the millions of multiethnic, working-class voters who refuse to vote for their candidates and won’t support tax increases on the wealthy, redistribution programs and entitlement expansion?</td>

      <td>Unions might resist, but most Democrats now agree that economic isolation is a losing proposition.</td>
      <td>President-elect Joe Biden probably wishes he could avoid trade policy. He can’t. To re-establish partnerships with allies, devise rules for a changing world economy, and prepare the American labor force for the future, Mr. Biden will have to defuse Donald Trump’s trade wars and connect his economic and foreign policies. The press reported on Wednesday that Mr. Biden will nominate Katherine Tai, a talented trade lawyer with experience in Congress, to be U.S. Trade Representative. Ms. Tai has an opportunity to reshape policy and realign trade politics.<br />Since 1947, America’s leadership has included setting the world’s trade agenda. Yet last month, without U.S. participation, 15 other countries in the Asia-Pacific, including China and U.S. allies, signed a new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership to establish rules for the most dynamic 30% of the world economy. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, launched in 2018, drew from provisions in U.S. free-trade agreements. But President Trump dropped out.<br />Countries around the world are negotiating the business standards of the future. The new architects of international economics are adapting to changes in supply chains, including the move to digital platforms and services. The U.S. has instead been preoccupied with raising tariffs. If the U.S. doesn’t show up for modern trade negotiations, it can hardly expect to set the rules.<br />The Biden administration has an opportunity to build a new domestic coalition for trade. In a 2020 survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75% of Democrats agreed that the economic connections of globalization are “mostly good” for the country. A bipartisan 74% said trade is good for the economy and 59% think trade creates jobs at home. Groups ranging from digital denizens to farmers know that economic isolationism is a loser. Even so, Mr. Biden’s political advisers may be inclined to bury the trade topic to avoid fights with labor unions.<br />A new Biden approach should highlight the digital economy, environmental goods and services, and health supplies, as well as intellectual property and agriculture. Accords can advance American values by including terms that boost transparency, fight corruption, and strengthen the rule of law, including for labor rights. The administration should combine its trade agenda with development plans, for example with Africa and Central America, and with carbon and biodiversity goals.</td>

      <td>As the coronavirus shuttered cinemas, first-run films moved online, and while home-viewing might not equal a packed theater, there were still plenty of standout movies to see.</td>
      <td>I remember the days. Of driving off to screening rooms and watching movies on big screens. Of going to multiplexes around town for previews of action adventures on enormous screens. Plenty of new movies have been released for streaming since the Covid-19 pandemic shut down theaters in March. Obviously, though, it hasn’t been the same. There’s a gnawing sense of loss for movie lovers. Of the spectacle that was usually pleasurable, even if the substance wasn’t so great. Of the nourishing ritual—not the popcorn or Milk Duds, though they were swell too, but the social ritual of sitting in the dark and sharing movies with people you did and didn’t know. (This is not the time to dwell on negatives like sticky floors and spectators chattering on their cellphones.)<br />There is also, speaking personally, a sense of fear—that the theatrical experience I’ve thrilled to since childhood may not be long for this world, even after the virus is gone. The outlook grew much darker when Warner Bros. announced that it would release its entire 2021 slate of theatrical films simultaneously in theaters and on its HBO Max streaming service. So much for movie theaters as a sacred domain of motion pictures; that quaint notion was already endangered by other studios shrinking the length of time new movies play in theaters before being released to home video.<br />Will the new Warner Bros. strategy apply only to next year’s films, or will it become the permanent normal? Will competitors follow suit? Whatever happens, the handwriting is on the big screen. Theater chains are already staggering under unprecedented debt loads, and their long-term survival depends in large part on shopping malls whose own prospects are iffy. And many independent theaters may not attempt to reopen, indie films having begun an inexorable transformation into online-only events.<br />As if corporate maneuverings weren’t sufficient reason to worry about the medium’s future, the pandemic has accelerated our national embrace of streaming channels at home. And no wonder, given vast program choices, fees that are reasonable compared with multiplex ticket and concession prices, and hurtling advances in home-theater technology. Watching films on the spacious flat screen in my living room—I’ve just upgraded to 65 from 55 inches—can be a very pleasant experience. It is almost, dare I say it, like going to the movies. There, I’ve said it, so let me remind you of a few films I’ve enjoyed thus far in this strangest of years—not the usual Ten Best, since the holiday release season hasn’t run its full course, but enough good ones to help keep movie love alive.<br />“First Cow” was the first victim of Covid-19 closings. Kelly Reichardt’s poetic vision of frontier life and entrepreneurship circa 1820 opened in four theaters, to ecstatic reviews, on March 6. Nine days later it was pulled from what would have been expanding national theatrical release as the pandemic exploded and movie theaters shut down. Partial justice was done in July, when the film went on streaming platforms for rental or purchase.</td>

      <td>EMMA Grueskin, a 25-year-old project manager for a furniture dealer, recently moved into her first apartment, a Brooklyn walk-up. Decorating indecision plagued her, but she couldn’t afford an interior designer. Then she stumbled on an unexpected source of personalized décor advice: Instagram.<br />As the app has become a thriving marketplace, the account owners behind some design “boutiques” have started serving as personal shoppers and on-demand decorators. They’ll happily scour estate and garage sales for clients in hopes of forming fruitful bonds, as Ms. Grueskin discovered.<br />In the accounts recommended to her by Instagram’s algorithm, she came across a shop called Frost Road House that fellow Brooklynite Gina Reese had launched in June, eager to turn her thrifting hobby into a lockdown side hustle. Ms. Grueskin eyed a photo of tempered glass bottles and trays, then realized it had been sold. She direct messaged Ms. Reese, who offered to create a custom bundle of bottles based on Ms. Grueskin’s specs and a photo of her bedroom. “It’s hard starting from scratch,” Ms. Grueskin admitted. “Having a relationship with someone who I know has good taste and is sourcing quality items is really helpful and cool.”<br />Covid-19 has inspired other Instagrammers to offer similar services. Mirrors of Magic’s Emma Rhoads, who paints custom designs on vintage mirrors, and Lucite Lust’s Jenny Ko, who sells contemporary and vintage homeware, also launched their shops in the past six months. “There’s so much space-shifting with the pandemic. I love helping people figure out who they want to be visually for this new stage in their life,” said Mx. Ko, who uses the gender-neutral honorific.<br />In Nashville, Ebb & Iv’s Alisa Jernigan creates mood boards for clients with pieces from her inventory.

      <td>The timing of the vaccine rollout could make things awkward for the Federal Reserve</td>
      <td>U.S. inflation readings are almost certainly heading higher next year. The trick will be figuring out whether they are signal or noise.<br />The Labor Department on Thursday reported that consumer prices rose 0.2% in November, putting them 1.2% higher than a year earlier. Prices excluding food and energy items—the so-called core that economists see as a better reflection of inflation’s underlying trend—were up 0.2% on the month and 1.6% on the year.<br />The inflation indexes the Federal Reserve focuses on, from the Commerce Department, run a bit cooler than the Labor Department measures, so for now inflation isn’t within spitting distance of the 2% the central bank is aiming for. That could change soon.<br />A big reason the year-over-year inflation readings are low now is that there was a dip in prices in March through May, when the Covid crisis first struck. Come next March, that shock will start reaching its first anniversary, and the year-over-year comparisons will appear souped-up as a result. If over the next half year prices on a monthly basis rise by just half as much as they did in November, for example, the Labor Department’s headline inflation measure would be up 2.6% on the year by May, with core prices up 2.3%.<br />But the cycling out of last year’s inflation dip won’t be the only thing going on next spring. By then millions of Americans will likely have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, relaxing safety measures just as warm weather returns. The likely result is a surge in demand, particularly in services categories such as travel.</td>

She expects to reach the U.S. before the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration.<br />But workers who assist migrants along the routes heading north believe the caravan has little chance of reaching U.S. soil. In October, thousands of Honduran migrants were blocked by Guatemalan security officers as they headed to Mexico. The Mexican government that month also deployed security forces at busy border crossings with Guatemala to prevent migrants from entering illegally.</td>
