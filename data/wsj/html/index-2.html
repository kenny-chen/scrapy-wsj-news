      <td>BEIJING—China’s consumer prices slipped into deflationary territory last month in year-over-year terms, while the country’s factory-gate prices began to reflate after 11 straight months of decline.<br />China’s producer-price index returned to inflation at the start of the year by rising 0.3% in January from a year earlier, compared with a 0.4% fall year-over-year in December.<br />Chinese producer prices began falling a year ago as the coronavirus pandemic ravaged first the domestic economy and then other parts of the world. Demand and production in the industrial sector were both weighed down, hitting commodity prices.<br />Now, driven by improved domestic demand and rising prices for crude oil, iron ore and other raw materials, Chinese producer prices rose 1.0% in January compared with a month earlier, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday.<br />With industrial production and demand continuing to improve, China’s producer-price index will likely remain in positive territory for the rest of the year, said Zhang Ning, an economist at UBS.</td>

      <td>Fears of suppression grow, given the military’s history of deadly violence against pro-democracy demonstrations</td>
      <td>Protesters in Myanmar poured into the streets for the fifth straight day Wednesday to oppose last week’s military coup, despite an escalating use of force by authorities.<br />A day earlier, police fired gunshots to disperse protesters, and used rubber bullets and water cannons, causing injuries and raising fears of harsher suppression. The United Nations expressed strong concern over Tuesday’s police action, saying the use of disproportionate force was unacceptable, and the U.S. condemned violence against demonstrators.<br />Tens of thousands of people have participated in street rallies and marches against the Feb. 1 takeover. The coup ended a democratic shift in the country that began a decade ago and abruptly put Myanmar back into the hands of the military, which has ruled it for much of the past seven decades since independence from British colonial rule. In past years of army domination, security forces relied on arrests, batons, militias and guns to put down pro-democracy uprisings.<br />Protesters are demanding that the military release hugely popular civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whom they detained as her government was deposed, and hand back power. In a speech Monday night, the leader of the coup, military chief Min Aung Hlaing, promised to build a “genuine and disciplined democratic system.” New elections would be held, he said, though it isn’t known what the terms of any such vote would be.<br />Signs that authorities might use greater force to suppress protests have been growing since Monday. As demonstrations surged in towns and cities throughout Myanmar, an ominous message appeared on state television, saying action would be taken against those who were disturbing the country’s stability and that lawbreakers shouldn’t be tolerated. Later, authorities effectively banned protests in parts of the country’s two largest cities, Yangon and Mandalay.</td>

      <td>The trade dispute has forced Chinese buyers to pay steep premiums for imports amid a supply crunch</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—China’s ban on Australian coal imports is intensifying a crisis in its coal market, which is battling surging prices, supply shortages, conflicting policy goals and a cold winter.<br />Locked in a diplomatic brawl over Canberra’s call for an independent global inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, Beijing imposed an informal ban around September that forced boatloads of Australian coal to languish at sea. China’s central government made the embargo official at a mid-December meeting with major Chinese electricity producers, who are big buyers of thermal coal.<br />The ban complicated a supply crunch that the meeting was convened to solve, government and state media reports show. China was short of thermal coal and officials urged the companies to import more—from anywhere except Australia, China’s biggest supplier. To comply, buyers in China have had to pay steep premiums for imports from farther afield, on top of prices that have risen 84% since midyear.<br />“Coal buyers are on tenterhooks watching the import market,” the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association, which represents importers, said in a statement. “It’s been hard to replenish low coal inventory and shortages, while demand is unabated.”<br />From Norwegian salmon to Mongolian commodities, Beijing has in recent years increasingly used China’s buying heft to apply political pressure abroad—but the coal market is showing that the strategy can backfire. Even as Chinese buyers obeyed Beijing, Australia’s coal prices rallied as other buyers from big coal-consuming nations, including Japan and India, stepped in.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats will begin formally making their case Wednesday to convict former President Donald Trump, a day after the Senate voted to proceed with Mr. Trump’s second impeachment trial.<br />After an afternoon of arguments Tuesday on whether it was constitutional to try a former president, six Republican senators joined all Democrats in a 56-44 vote asserting the Senate’s authority to try Mr. Trump, who was impeached by the House last month in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. He left office Jan. 20.<br />Starting at noon, Democrats will have 16 hours to make their case, after which Mr. Trump’s defense team will have another 16 hours. Each trial day is expected to last eight hours. Both sides will also have the option to call for a debate and vote on calling witnesses, but it isn’t clear whether either side will seek to do so. Democrats last week asked Mr. Trump to testify, which the former president’s lawyers shot down.<br />Democrats are expected to offer as evidence video and audio presentations of the Jan. 6 riot, as they make their case that Mr. Trump incited his supporters to storm the Capitol. On Tuesday, House impeachment managers played a 13-minute video of Mr. Trump encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol and of the subsequent violence that resulted in five deaths, including that of a Capitol Police officer.<br />“That’s a high crime and misdemeanor,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the lead impeachment manager, said before playing the video on Tuesday. “If that’s not an impeachable offense, then there’s no such thing.”</td>

      <td>Top moments and themes from Tuesday’s presentations and vote on the constitutionality of the proceedings</td>
      <td>Here are five takeaways from the first day of the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump.<br />1. Democrats Draw Some GOP Support, but Face Uphill Battle<br />Tuesday’s debate and vote focused on whether a former president can be tried by the Senate in an impeachment proceeding. After an afternoon of presentations by House managers and former President Trump’s lawyers, the Senate voted 56-44 that the case was constitutional and could proceed, as six Republicans sided with Democrats on that narrow question. But the vote total was well short of the 67 that will be needed to convict the former president on the broader question of whether he incited an insurrection at the Capitol. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana was the only Republican to shift to the Democrats’ position on the question of constitutionality. He had sided with Republicans in a test vote last month over the constitutionality of trying a former president. On Tuesday, he sided with Democrats in asserting that the Senate had jurisdiction.<br />2. Debating the ‘January Exception’ to Impeachment<br />Democrats said the trial was on solid legal footing and that the Constitution didn’t include a “January exception” that would allow presidents to go unpunished for improper actions in the final weeks of their tenure. Mr. Trump’s lawyers countered that the Senate can’t try Mr. Trump because he is now a private citizen and can’t be penalized by removal from office. “Presidents are impeachable, presidents are removable,” said Trump lawyer David Schoen. “Former presidents are not because they cannot be removed.” But lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.) argued that removal from office was never “the exclusive purpose of impeachment in America.’’ Democrats plan to hold a vote to bar Mr. Trump from office if he is convicted.</td>

      <td>Lead defense lawyer ‘just rambled on and on and on,’ says one Republican lawmaker</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Republican senators criticized former President Donald Trump’s impeachment lawyers’ presentations as underwhelming and ineffective, even as all but six GOP lawmakers sided with the defense team’s position that the case was unconstitutional.<br />In an afternoon session dedicated to the question of whether the trial was constitutional, Trump lawyer Bruce L. Castor Jr. had a rough start: He introduced himself as the “lead prosecutor,” before clarifying that he was Mr. Trump’s lead counsel and assuring senators: “I do understand the difference.”<br />In about 45 minutes of remarks, Mr. Castor veered from the fall of Rome and Greece to the trade-off between liberty and security, occasionally referencing his relationships with some senators while only briefly addressing the core questions of the case.<br />In an unusual concession, he said Democrats’ leadoff arguments had been better than expected. “I’ll be quite frank with you: We changed what we were going to do on account that we thought the House managers’ presentation was well done,” Mr. Castor said.<br />Republicans offered harsh assessments of Mr. Trump’s team, while many praised the Democrats’ lead manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, as well-prepared and impassioned.</td>

      <td>The president gives another bleak assessment on the economy while his Labor Department reports an increase in job openings.</td>
      <td>The young Biden administration has already settled into an odd pattern of dissonance between the economic data the government reports and the president’s characterization of the economy. Encouraging updates from federal agencies are followed by gloomy proclamations from the Oval Office intended to justify massive federal action. Tuesday brought another bleak political message on the heels of a positive market reading.<br />In the morning the Labor Department reported that U.S. job openings ticked up in December to 6.6 million. This not only represented a slight increase from November’s historically high reading of 6.5 million but also exceeded the prior-year level during the pre-Covid salad days.<br />Recently this column noted that, in the language of the Obama-Biden administration, our new President Joe Biden has received a sizable “inheritance” from his predecessor in terms of a rebounding economy.  Measured in terms of the number of open positions for U.S. workers, the last full month of the Trump presidency is the greatest “inheritance” any U.S. president has ever passed on to his successor.<br />December’s 6.6 million job openings exceed by more than a million the number in President Barack Obama’s last full month in office. And President Biden’s “inheritance” from Donald Trump is more than twice the size of the one President George W. Bushbequeathed to Mr. Obama.<br />But you would never know it listening to Mr. Biden at the White House  today. Prior to a meeting with corporate chieftains, the president didn’t mention the good news his government had reported just hours earlier. Instead, he offered essentially the same talking points he’s been using since last spring’s shutdowns.</td>

      <td>Shares have soared recently, but heavy investments show the social-media platform has some rough edges to smooth out</td>
      <td>Social media is often about appearing to be more polished than you really are.  Twitter  is no exception.<br />From the looks of its fourth-quarter report, the company hardly seems like one that has recently been embroiled in political controversy. In that quarter, Twitter was the subject of frequent criticism from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans. And in January, it booted Mr. Trump off its platform. His account was once followed by nearly half the company’s total base of monetizable daily users, and the move enraged many of them in the process.<br />On the surface, at least, it doesn’t seem to have mattered. The company said Tuesday it boosted the number of users by 27% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter and that people continued to flock to the platform throughout January despite the political criticism from both right and left.<br />But looks can be deceiving. In its shareholder letter, Twitter managed to avoid the elephant in the room, opting to share its outlook for the remainder of 2021 without much political context. But it did say it expects to see user growth slow from 27% in the fourth quarter to low-double digits in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, indicating the 34% pace the company posted in the second quarter of 2020 was about as good as it gets.<br />Twitter’s shares are up 39% over the last three months, even before they rose another 3% after hours on Tuesday. Those are roughly the same gains as  Pinterest ,  a social-media service that reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 76% last week and projected another quarter of 70%-plus sales growth for the first quarter. Twitter’s first-quarter guidance for revenue growth of just over 22% at the midpoint looks rather dull by comparison.</td>

      <td>Democrats lobby Biden to write off debt for affluent borrowers.</td>
      <td>The Biden Presidency is quickly turning into Barack Obama’s third term, only more liberal. Consider the Democrats calling on President Biden to use the pandemic to cancel $50,000 in student debt per borrower. What they want everyone to forget is that in 2010 they used the last recession to justify a federal takeover of student loans that have since more than doubled to $1.6 trillion. Now they’re using the pandemic to justify loan write-offs they said would never happen.<br />The great student loan scam began in 2010 when Democrats used budget “savings” from ending the federal guaranteed-loan program to pay for ObamaCare. “By cutting out the middleman, we’ll save American taxpayers $68 billion in the coming years,” Mr. Obama declared. Where were the media fact-checkers then?<br />An analysis for the Education Department last year estimated that $435 billion in student loans (excluding private originated loans that are federally guaranteed) will eventually be written off. One reason: Democrats in 2010 created “income-based repayment plans” that limited borrower monthly payments to 10% of discretionary income and discharged the remaining balance after 20 years.<br />These plans now comprise a third of new undergraduate and nearly 60% of graduate loans. Since many borrowers are making only de minimis payments, their balances continue to grow and accrue interest, although most will be forgiven. In other words, the feds are already set to write down a large chunk of debt.<br />But unwilling to let the pandemic go to waste, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer and House Democrats are demanding that Mr. Biden go further and cancel as much as $50,000 in debt per person. Ms. Warren says this would cost taxpayers a wee $650 billion and “boost our economy right now.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The second impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump opened with graphic videos of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Some of the clips played by the House impeachment managers featured the senators themselves and the same chamber in which they now sit in judgment.<br />Almost all 100 senators, most of them masked because of Covid-19, silently watched and listened in the hushed chamber as rioters on the screens rammed doors, attacked police, and chanted: “Treason!” and “Traitors!” and “Where the f--- are they?!”<br />The trial began 27 days after the House impeached Mr. Trump, accusing him of inciting the mob that stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn his loss to President Biden in the November election.<br />As the video played Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) watched from his front-row seat near the middle of the floor. He sat motionless, his hands clasped loosely in his lap, as the video replayed his own forceful speech from that same spot, shortly before rioters broke into the building.<br />In those remarks, Mr. McConnell said there was no doubt that Mr. Biden won the presidency on Nov. 3. He warned that overturning the election would send democracy into a “death spiral.”</td>

The average yield on U.S. junk bonds dropped below 4% for the first time on Monday amid a market scavenger hunt for higher returns.<br />The Federal Reserve has pushed down long-term interest rates by buying bonds and committed to keep short-term interest rates at near zero through 2023. While the central bank’s interventions were needed in March, it continued to buy corporate bonds well into the summer when markets didn’t need the support.<br />Chairman Jerome Powell last month reassured investors that the Fed won’t take away its market support until the economy makes “substantial further progress” toward inflation above 2% and maximum employment. The rush into high-yield corporate and municipal debt has since accelerated with yields dropping due to great demand.<br />Junk-rated Chicago Public Schools and the city of Detroit recently floated bonds yielding less than 2%. Spreads with the AAA muni-bond benchmark have collapsed. The sages at  BlackRock  last month recommended high-yield munis for their “diversification benefits” and “high levels of income” and saw “significant value” in Puerto Rican bonds.<br />Investors are on the prowl for high-yield corporates, and money managers are cold-calling non-investment grade companies to pitch deals. January was a record month for junk-bond sales. Companies rated in the three lowest non-investment tiers before default have set records for weekly borrowing twice this year, says  Bank of America .  Investors are even snapping up junk bonds that fund dividends and those that allow borrowers to pay interest with more debt.</td>

      <td>Even Senate Democrats wonder why he ousted an Illinois U.S. Attorney.</td>
      <td>A new President abruptly fires a prosecutor overseeing high-level political corruption cases. That’s big news, right? Well, it was in 2017 when President Trump axed Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time and a media favorite. You can tell power in Washington has changed hands because of the muted response as the Biden White House ousts U.S. Attorney John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois.<br />Joe Biden is swiftly pushing out almost all U.S. attorneys who served under his predecessor, which is increasingly the norm for new Presidents. But even Illinois Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, staunch allies of Mr. Biden, objected to his firing of Mr. Lausch, who has been a scourge of corruption in Democratic-dominated Springfield.<br />“While we agree with the Biden Administration’s criminal justice agenda, we are disappointed with the decision to terminate U.S. Attorney Lausch without consulting us,” the Senators said in a statement Tuesday. They cited the need to “conclude sensitive investigations” and added that “Mr. Lausch should be permitted to continue in his position until his successor is confirmed by the Senate.”<br />Mr. Lausch’s corruption probes have implicated a Chicago alderman and Springfield politicians. In July 2020 his office announced a $200 million settlement with the state’s primary electric utility company for its efforts to buy off “associates of a high-level elected official for the state of Illinois.”<br />That official is reported to be Michael Madigan, who until last month had been Speaker of the Illinois House for all but two years since 1983. The investigation is continuing, and there’s no reason outside of politics that Mr. Lausch shouldn’t be kept on the job until the Senate confirms a successor. Mr. Lausch’s four-year term ends in November 2021, and getting a replacement could take that long.</td>

      <td>President Biden may not have buyers’ remorse over his executive order canceling the Keystone XL oil pipeline, but many others are raising the political price for his job-killing decision. And some of the second thoughts are coming from his own coalition.<br />On Tuesday West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin wrote Mr. Biden asking him “to reconsider” his executive order. Mr. Manchin, who introduced the first Keystone XL bill in 2012, noted that “pipelines continue to be the safest mode to transport our oil and natural gas resources and they support thousands of high-paying, American union jobs.”<br />Mr. Manchin’s call echoed remarks by Richard Trumka. In a recent interview with “Axios on HBO,” the president of the AFL-CIO criticized Mr. Biden’s decision and said the Laborers’ International Union of North America was right to say it would cost 1,000 existing union jobs and 10,000 projected construction jobs.<br />The union chief was also skeptical about the “green jobs” that Mr. Biden keeps saying will replace them: “You know, when they laid off at the mines back in Pennsylvania, they told us they were going to train us to be computer programmers.” Readers may recall that John Kerry, Mr. Biden’s climate envoy, recently said workers who lose jobs in fossil fuels will be able to make solar panels. Sure, if they move to China, where most solar panels are made.<br />Meanwhile, 14 Republican state attorneys general also wrote Mr. Biden asking him to reconsider his Keystone XL diktat. The AGs said Montana will lose $58 million in tax revenue, and “five of the six impacted counties are designated high-poverty areas. So your decision to shut down the project means less money for schools, less money for public services, and the elimination of business and job opportunities in those areas where they are most needed.”</td>

What advice would you give to other students?” Click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Feb. 16. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />The Greater Fool<br />The extent to which the Reddit users discussing investments do good is proportional to their participation in the price-discovery mechanism. At its best, social media serves as a forum for retail investors to conduct and share research. Investors, acting on the profit motive, will attempt to discover discrepancies between the price and long-term value of a security. If, say, a given security’s long-term value is greater than its current market price, investors will buy, raising demand and driving the market price up toward the long-term value. Minimizing price discrepancies encourages efficient allocation of capital, and collaboration through social media allows retail investors to take advantage of research otherwise available only to large institutions.<br />At its worst, social-media driven investors actively undermine the price- discovery mechanism. GameStop and AMC feature prominently in headlines, but  BB Liquidating Inc.  best illustrates the patent absurdity of Redditor investing. A remnant of the bankrupt Blockbuster Video, the firm’s latest Form 10-K states that it has “no ongoing business operations” and “will not have any operations in the future.” Nevertheless, in a few days in late January its share price rose 3,000%, giving the company an intraday high of $44 million in market capitalization.</td>

      <td>Begin with a goal, focus on the long term, talk to the other side, and never make empty threats.</td>
      <td>To the world, George P. Shultz was one of the 20th century’s most consequential people—a giant of economics and diplomacy. The man we knew had a unique ability to translate ideas into policies. Call it “the Shultz way.”<br />It always began with a goal. He wanted to expand liberty and prosperity and knew free markets were the best way to do it. At Princeton he’d been a varsity football player, and he often used sports analogies. The “accountability factor is unavoidable in all sports,” he’d say. “The free market system is one of accountability, which will work relentlessly against bad performance and reward the good.”<br />In developing policies, the Shultz way took account of the politics surrounding an issue but never lost sight of the goal. In 1971, as director of the Office of Management and Budget, he explained his approach to policy making in a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago. “Those of you familiar with sailing know what a telltale is—a strip of cloth tied to a mast to show which way the wind is blowing,” he explained. “A captain has the choice of steering his ship by the telltale, following the prevailing winds, or to steer by the compass. In a democracy, you must keep your eye on the telltale, but you must set your course by the compass.”<br />His policy approach focused on the long term. He sought to identify challenges as they emerged and develop policies to ensure that they didn’t become problems. He loved bringing people together to hash out policy solutions. Shultz was the “great convener.” He regularly gave dinners and lunches at his house on the Stanford campus or in San Francisco. He held seminars in his conference rooms at the Hoover Institution, bringing together diverse groups of academics. He hosted Nobel Laureates like Milton Friedman and Gary Becker at an annual economists weekend in Monterey, Calif. Policy makers of both parties—including former presidents—eagerly accepted his invitations and will miss them now that he is gone.<br />These get-togethers were, in part, social. But they also had a more important purpose: to develop big policies and figure out how to turn ideas to action.</td>

      <td>Toronto<br />Canada and the U.S. have much in common—history, geography, culture and cherished values of free speech and assembly. Since the U.S. election in November, we have something more in common: We are both “back.” President Biden tweeted as much a couple of weeks after the election: “America is back.” The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, also tweeted a “Welcome back” to America that month. A couple of weeks ago, the Toronto Star featured an article with the headline “Joe Biden’s inauguration was a message to the world: America is back.”<br />Canada has been back since October 2015, when, on his victorious election night, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, “On behalf of 35 million Canadians, we’re back.” He was re-elected in 2019, and though his parliamentary majority was reduced to a minority, he and we remain back.<br />Where were Canada and the U.S. before coming back? Away, apparently. Gone baby, gone. The U.S. and Canada suffered through modern Dark Ages, dictatorial enemy occupations from which there was no respite and in which there was no hope. That is, until citizens voting in free elections, following years of open debate and criticism, ousted President Trump and Prime Minister Stephen Harper.<br />Canada has been back for longer than the U.S., but Americans have already gotten a taste of what’s in store. First, virtue signaling: Messrs. Biden and Trudeau both made a show of selecting diverse cabinets. Mr. Biden rejoined the powerless Paris Agreement and Mr. Trudeau tried to win Canada a U.N. Security Council seat. He failed, but we’re still back. You may get to know the feeling.</td>

We drafted a constitution and planned for new elections.<br />We Yemenis have learned the hard way the price of a collapsed democratic transition. In 2014 Houthi armed factions, backed by Iran, seized power and plunged Yemen into civil war. The Houthis have attacked civilian targets, including schools, mosques, airports and parades. They have launched drones and ballistic missiles at neighboring countries, and have coordinated with U.S.-designated terrorist groups such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah. Last week we learned they are still obstructing international efforts to salvage the FSO Safer oil tanker and avert an environmental catastrophe.<br />Unfortunately, much of Congress’s attention—notably among Democrats—has focused not on the Houthis but on the Arab countries striving to restore Yemen’s legitimate government in line with multiple U.N. resolutions.<br />We welcome President Biden’s desire to accelerate a negotiated solution, even after announcing the end of U.S. assistance for the coalition’s “offensive” operations.</td>

      <td>Their rigid opposition to charter schools and in-person learning has parents and even politicians fed up.</td>
      <td>Perhaps it doesn’t receive much attention anymore because it’s become so commonplace. The best schools in New York state are again public charter schools. Ho-hum.<br />According to the most recent data from School Digger, a website that aggregates test score results, 23 of the top 30 schools in New York in 2019 were charters. The feat is all the more impressive because those schools sported student bodies that were more than 80% black and Hispanic, and some two-thirds of the kids qualified for free or discount lunches. The Empire State’s results were reflected nationally. In a U.S. News & World Report ranking released the same year, three of the top 10 public high schools in the country were charters, as were 23 of the top 100—even though charters made up only 10% of the nation’s 24,000 public high schools.<br />We are told constantly by defenders of the education status quo that the learning gap is rooted in poverty, segregation and “systemic” racism. We’re told that blaming traditional public schools for substandard student outcomes isn’t fair given the raw material that teachers have to work with. But if a student’s economic background is so decisive, or if black students need to be seated next to whites to understand Shakespeare and geometry, how can it be that so many of the most successful public schools are dominated by low-income minorities?<br />Some will argue that charter schools obtain these results by picking the best students, which isn’t true. Of the 43 states that have charters, all but three—Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming—mandate that lotteries be used to choose students randomly. Washington Post education writer Jay Matthews reports that even states that don’t officially require the use of lotteries use them anyway or employ “other impartial ways of admitting students.”<br />A second popular argument against charter schools is that they benefit from having motivated students, which is true but misleading. Numerous empirical studies have shown that charter students outperformed similarly motivated peers in traditional public schools who applied to a charter but weren’t admitted. But there’s an even more fundamental problem with the “motivation” explanation of charter success, as Thomas Sowell explains in his most recent book, “Charter Schools and Their Enemies.”</td>

      <td>It was the ﬁrst time that a black man in the South had dared to sue a white mob for damages, and it caused a sensation.</td>
      <td>Around 12 o’clock on the cold, moonlit night of Jan. 21, 1897, a 42-year-old black farmer named George Dinning, his wife, Mollie, and seven of their children were sleeping in their cabin near Price’s Mill, Ky., when they were awakened by two dozen white men surrounding the house. Wielding pistols and shotguns, the mob accused Dinning of some recent thefts and ordered him to vacate his 125-acre farm, which he had purchased 20 years before from the family that had enslaved him.<br />When Dinning called out that he wasn’t guilty, and could prove it, the men fired into the cabin, grazing him in the head and arm. Still in his underclothes, he grabbed his shotgun, ran to an upstairs window and got off a single round of birdshot, killing 32-year-old Jodie Conn, the son of a wealthy planter. The mob fired another volley and then retreated. The next morning Dinning surrendered to the Simpson County sheriff, Bud Clark. That same day, several men returned to the farm, evicted Mollie, and torched the fields, house and outbuildings. She and the children fled to relatives in Tennessee.<br />Kentucky (birthplace of both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis) had declared neutrality in the Civil War, but racist violence was common there in the 1890s, with 10 lynchings recorded in the 13 months before the attack on George Dinning. As Ben Montgomery relates in “A Shot in the Moonlight,” his deeply felt, copiously researched chronicle of this episode and its repercussions, what made Dinning’s case extraordinary, even more than his forceful self-defense, was his unprecedented search for justice.<br />Dinning was aided by a surprising number of whites, starting with Sheriff Clark, who spirited his prisoner to distant Louisville for safekeeping. Later, when Dinning was conveyed back to Simpson County to be tried for murder, many doubted that he would live to see the verdict. But Republican Gov. William Bradley, who had recently signed an anti-lynching law, dispatched two companies of soldiers to guard the accused, along with a pair of cannon.<br />When the trial began, in June, the prosecution witnesses admitted to being in the crowd that night but claimed that they had gone with friendly intent and were leaving when Dinning fired. The defense attorney, a local man known for fairness, seized on the implausibilities and inconsistencies in their testimony. Why would Dinning shoot if the men were dispersing? When the white jury returned, they found the defendant not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, sentencing him to seven years at hard labor.</td>

The group holds a combined 6.3% stake in the Greeneville, Tenn., company, the people said.<br />Forward Air, which has a market value of around $2.3 billion, specializes in expedited less-than-truckload services, including airport-to-airport shipments of high value products such as automotive parts and electronics equipment. It also has smaller intermodal and pool-distribution segments. Like other trucking and logistics companies, its volumes dropped sharply in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, though they have since been recovering.<br />The activist group believes the company has other problems. It argues that Forward Air’s performance has lagged behind that of peers like XPO Logistics Inc. and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. because it has diversified instead of staying focused on its core expedited business, the people said. The group blames this on acquisitions and capital expenditures over the past decade or so that have hurt the company’s return on invested capital.<br />The activist’s goal is to get its four director candidates voted in at the annual meeting so they can affect changes including strengthening management and improving margins. Its candidates are Forward Air’s founder Scott Niswonger, former CFO Andrew Clarke, Ancora’s James Chadwick and leadership consultant Dawn Garibaldi, the people said.</td>

      <td>Corn, cattle farmers tell WSJ Global Food Forum that prioritizing trade would help reduce the need for government aid</td>
      <td>U.S. farmers said new trade deals are critical to help boost agricultural producers after the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic and the Trump administration’s trade battles.<br />Firming up existing trade agreements and joining with multicountry trade pacts would give U.S. producers better prices for some products than they can get domestically, farmers said at the WSJ Global Food Forum. Farmers said giving priority to trade would help reduce the need for government aid, which climbed to a record level in 2020 as the Trump administration sought to stem losses from the U.S.-China trade war and the food-supply chain was upended by the pandemic.<br />“If we don’t have trade we’re not going to get the full value of what we’re selling,” said Kimberly Ratcliff, a Texas cattle rancher.<br />Mr. Trump’s tenure was a turbulent time for U.S. farmers, who have grown more reliant on selling their crops and meat overseas as domestic production outstrips the appetites of U.S. consumers. Duties the Trump administration levied on goods from China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union sparked retaliatory tariffs targeting U.S. agricultural products from pork to soybeans to apples, cutting into U.S. agricultural exports and sending farm commodity prices plunging.<br />President Biden said during his campaign that he would scale back trade disputes and align like-minded countries to push nations, including China, to engage in fairer trade practices. That approach could limit China’s ability to target U.S. farm goods with retaliatory tariffs, Mr. Biden’s campaign said, protecting U.S. farmers from market swings.</td>

      <td>Kyle Allen and Kathryn Newton play teenagers stuck in a ‘Groundhog Day’-like time loop.</td>
      <td>‘Groundhog Day” was released in theaters 28 years ago (Feb. 12, 1993) and has only grown in stature over the years; it ranks alongside “Rashomon” as a 20th-century-born archetype of cinematic storytelling. Imitations, naturally, abound: Last year’s “Palm Springs” was yet another variation on the theme. But when a movie comes right out and acknowledges its debt—as does “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things”—it does a lot to win you over.<br />“Wasn’t there a movie…?” asks Henry (Jermaine Harris), as his friend Mark (Kyle Allen) tries to explain the “temporal anomaly” he’s found himself in—the same day on an endless loop, the same lottery number winning, Henry regularly losing the same videogame every time they hang out. Yeah, yeah, Mark answers, acknowledging the “Groundhog” question, but knowing, too, that Henry won’t remember their conversation tomorrow—or whenever it is. And that the video aliens Henry is facing off against will, for the umpteenth time, blow his avatar’s head off.<br />Based on a short story and screenplay by Lev Grossman and directed by Ian Samuels, “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things” introduces Mark like he’s the smiling steel ball in a Rube Goldberg contraption, rolling by and through events and people in such a seamless, choreographed manner it suggests he’s prescient, or a complete wise guy, or some kind of delinquent. Then one realizes that he’s done and seen the same thing so many times that he has everything timed to the split second. And he knows every move. By everyone. He even carries a pair of tongs in his back pocket on his way to school to straighten, surreptitiously, the skirt of a woman whose slip is showing. Every day.<br />The inescapable distraction with a film like “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things” is the search for the logical holes in the fabric of the story. If a certain thing happens today, one asks oneself, can it happen again…today? We don’t know how long Mark’s been stuck, but he’s got everything rehearsed to such a T that it might be years. Is he getting older? Is anyone else?<br />The larger hiccup in one’s digestion of Mr. Grossman’s storyline is Mark’s discovery of Margaret (Kathryn Newton, “Big Little Lies”), who is also trapped in time but wants little to do with Mark—she won’t even discuss how they got into their time bubble, or how to get out. Margaret knows more than she’s telling. Mark is intrigued by the ripple Margaret has caused in his time-space-romance continuum.</td>

The agency made the request Monday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn.<br />GPB Capital’s founder and former chief executive, David Gentile, as well as associates Jeffry Schneider and Jeffrey Lash, were arrested on criminal fraud and conspiracy charges last week in connection with what the authorities said was a scheme to deceive some 17,000 investors in four GPB funds, including two that invested in auto dealerships.<br />“The principal source for potential investor recovery is revenue generated by the several dozen automobile dealerships owned by GPB Capital,” the SEC said in a court filing to support its request for an independent monitor. “These dealerships have contractual relationships with lenders and manufacturers that are now at risk of termination because of, among other things, Gentile’s arrest.”<br />Mr. Gentile stepped down as CEO of GPB Capital on Friday, the day after the charges were brought against him in federal court, but the firm indicated the move was temporary and named Rob Chmiel, its chief financial officer, as interim CEO. Mr. Gentile owns GPB Capital.</td>

      <td>A Discovery+ documentary re-examines the sensational 2013 murder trial that turned the accused into a public villain.</td>
      <td>Jodi Arias was young, beautiful and by every indication a ruthless murderer, a combination that made her not only an object of media fascination when she went on trial in 2013 but of public vilification that seemed to take on a life of its own. It was a sensational case—Arias, now serving life without parole, had presented a number of wildly different stories at the beginning of the investigation, wound up testifying to her own disadvantage for 18 days, and was at the center of an event that was widely considered a circus. It was a sordid affair, but the way it occupied the intersection of criminal justice and the media gave it a special place among capital cases,<br />“If I Can’t Have You: The Jodi Arias Story” is certainly a Jodi Arias story—it offers, among other new details, glimpses of Arias’s journal entries and interviews with friends of Travis Alexander, the ex-boyfriend businessman murdered in 2008. It offers up gory if not overly gruesome crime-scene photos; it explores Alexander’s Mormonism and the way it affected the couple’s relationship and the case; it examines the unfaithfulness and jealousy that provided motive (hence the series title). If there’s a message being sent by Discovery+, it’s that the new streaming service will remain faithful to the stuff that has made Investigation Discovery a destination for true-crime devotees (while also offering Animal Planet, Food Network, HGTV, OWN, TLC, Travel Channel and other Discovery Inc.-affiliated outlets). The Arias case, after all, is the kind of well to which one can return time and again, without running dry of appalling minutiae.<br />This may be part of the strategy behind the two-part program, whose producers seem to be hedging their bets. One of the principal interviewees is attorney Jennifer Willmott, a member of the Arias defense team and one of the lawyers who saved a widely disparaged client from the death penalty. (The jury had voted 8-4 in favor of execution before a deadlock was declared.) Much of the miniseries is devoted to the self-defense strategy that was put forth by Ms. Willmott and L. Kirk Nurmi (whom Arias sued after he wrote a book about her case. He was later disbarred.). Their defense included accusations of abuse against Arias both by her father and by Alexander. As explained toward the end of episode 2, there are hopes that Arias will be granted a new trial based on the media coverage of the first, the unexplored aspects of the investigation, and the misbehavior of the prosecutor, former Maricopa County deputy attorney Juan Martinez. (He too was disbarred, last year, and appears in the show.)<br />While the public loathing of Arias is made quite plain at the beginning of episode 1, it’s not until late in the game that the details of the Alexander murder are revisited. Alexander was stabbed at least 27 times (the exact number seems to be disputed). His throat was cut. He was shot in the head. Self-defense can be argued. So can abuse. What “If I Can’t Have You” doesn’t want to argue very strenuously is vicious premeditated murder, because it may well be that we have not seen the last of Jodi Arias. And smart producers burn no bridges.</td>

      <td>I look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats alike on making our democracy more accessible.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Didn’t Vote? Here’s Your $20 Fine” (Feb. 5): In January, I suggested that voting should be considered a civic duty. The response has been a bit surprising. The editorial board questions whether there was an inherent benefit to high voter turnout. One of my colleagues told a talk radio host that I was looking to establish “voting police.” With fervor, conservatives have risen to the defense of every citizen’s right to disengage from civic life.<br />Our government expects all citizens to engage in a variety of activities for the national benefit: selective service, jury duty, the census and taxes all come to mind. Liberals and conservatives alike recognize that those institutions are so vital to our national livelihood that they cannot be built on a voluntary basis. But no activity is more core to the American project than voting. There is no benefit to low turnout. An uncast ballot is not an ideological triumph—it is merely an indication that our democratic government is not as representative as it ought to be. Perhaps that’s why 26 successful democracies, e.g., Australia, already have enacted civic-duty voting.<br />Still, I knew that such a bold reform would not become law anytime soon. Sadly, our country isn’t ready for it.<br />In Connecticut, I’m fighting for early voting, no-excuse absentee ballots and other reforms to make democracy more accessible. In pushing for these changes, Democrats often mention the very people whom you identify as less likely to vote—“busy single moms, apolitical 19-year-olds, the homeless”—as a reason to modernize our laws. Frustratingly, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle roll their eyes and claim that any citizen can figure out a way to cast a ballot.<br />So I called their bluff. I proposed civic-duty voting, and people on the right became newly concerned with voter access. They actually admitted that some citizens may not have convenient access to the ballot.</td>

      <td>Jason Riley’s “Progressives Put the Racial ‘Equity’ Squeeze on Biden” (Upward Mobility, Feb. 3) touches on the importance of controlling the narrative. The “E-word” used to stand for equality. But over the last few years diversity, equality and inclusion initiatives now speak to equity. Why the difference? As Mr. Riley states, equality can be interpreted as equal opportunity, while equity can assume an equal outcome, that a society’s wealth is owned in common and not primarily by those who create it. Equity means everyone has an equal share of the pie regardless of the contribution.<br />The word equality has now been tacitly banned; it will soon be labeled a construct of white privilege intended to coerce people to hard work. But it’s hard to unlearn the old narrative. Mr. Riley quotes the president as saying: “this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equity.” But listen to the audio. The president starts to say “racial equality” but catches himself in midword. He says: “racial equali . . . equity.” The old dog hasn’t fully learned the new trick.

Dissidents should never be linked to diplomacy over something as existential as nuclear war. If U.S. Presidents Nixon and Reagan had refused to negotiate nuclear-arms reductions with Russian leaders because of the way Moscow mistreated its dissidents, America’s most enduring nuclear treaties with Russia would never have helped both sides avoid nuclear war.<br />Mr. Biden’s decision to accept the longest possible extension (five years) of the New Start treaty without negotiating new conditions troubles you. Yet one of your complaints against the Iran nuclear accord in 2015 was that its limits on Tehran had expiration dates.<br />You argue that Russia violates arms accords. Yet we Americans pulled out of the 1972 missile-defense treaty and the 1987 intermediate-range missile treaty with Moscow. Treaties cannot be made with enemies willing to cheat, according to you.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Senate Democrats are pushing to include an increase in the federal minimum wage in their Covid-19 relief package, despite reservations from some in the party and other potential hurdles.<br />House Democrats this week unveiled a coronavirus relief package that included a provision to raise the federal minimum wage over time to $15 per hour, up from its current level of $7.25 per hour. In the Senate, however, procedural rules for passing legislation without GOP support raise complications for Democrats hoping to quickly move a minimum-wage increase, and at least one Democrat—Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia—has said he is opposed to the change.<br />Mr. Schumer indicated Tuesday that he was still hoping to pass it in the Senate.<br />“We’re trying to work as well as we can with the parliamentarian to get minimum wage to happen, that’s all I’m going to say,” Mr. Schumer said.<br />Both the House and Senate last week passed a budget outline, opening up a process known as reconciliation that would allow them to pass President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation. Democratic leaders have said they hope to secure some GOP support, but they are making plans to pass the legislation without it. Still, they can’t afford to lose any Democratic votes in the evenly divided Senate.</td>

People even nerdier than me will like that it tracks your location to let you know the quality of the air and the approximate number of particles it’s protected you against.<br />Others I tested, like the N95-equipped MaskFone ($50, maskfone.com), have integrated wireless earbuds to prevent dreaded mask-muffle on calls, or mechanical ventilation systems that release heat you generate by exhaling. All are designed, according to their manufacturers, for a world where even getting vaccinated doesn’t obviate the need to wear a face-covering.<br />But, as buzzy as this wizardry might be, are high-tech masks really worth the fuss compared to their no-brainer counterparts?<br />Dale Pfriem, principal of Protective Equipment Consulting Services and part of a standards-development working group addressing federal mask guidelines, says he’s in favor of any feature that makes people more likely to wear their masks. As long as the products meet fit and filtration standards, that is. (The AirPop is compliant with EU Committee for Standardization and ASTM International barrier-mask guidelines.)</td>

It plans to delist the Paris-based investment bank.<br />The buyout is part of a reset strategy to rein in risk, cut costs, and restore confidence in the investment bank, analysts said.<br />The takeover would be the end of the road as a public company for Natixis, which was born through a merger in 2006 with aspirations to become an investment banking player on a global scale.<br />The bank repeatedly ran into trouble. It suffered badly during the 2008-09 financial crisis. The government merged its parents, the retail-lending cooperatives Banque Fédérale des Banques Populaires and Caisse Nationale des Caisses d’Epargne, creating BPCE, and rescued Natixis. Natixis later set aside nearly half a billion euros for its role directing investor cash to funds managed by disgraced financier Bernard Madoff.</td>

Decades of research have found that while many Poles risked their own lives to help Jews, others participated in or assisted the slaughter.<br />The ruling Law and Justice party has tried to limit discussion of the actions of Polish nationals in the genocide, warning that it considers any investigation into alleged complicity of Poles in the Holocaust as dishonoring Poland. It prefers to portray the country as a blameless victim of larger regional powers.<br />The party oversaw the introduction of a libel law in 2018 to punish anyone falsely accusing Poles of collaborating with the Nazis, despite objections from the U.S., Israel and some survivors from the Auschwitz concentration camp. “It is important to protect the good name of Poland and Polish people,” Polish President Andrzej Duda said at the time. “We have the right to our historical truth.”<br />Tuesday’s verdict, delivered by Warsaw district court, now threatens to widen the schism between the European Union’s executive in Brussels and more nationalistic-minded countries in the bloc’s east. The court found that a 1,600-page academic study, “Night Without End: Fate of Jews in Selected Counties of Occupied Poland,” had violated the libel law by documenting cases of Catholic Poles collaborating with the Nazi regime.</td>

      <td>Acquisition of Glu Mobile is videogame publisher’s latest attempt to buy into a difficult market</td>
      <td>Leveling up in mobile games doesn’t come cheap these days. For  Electronic Arts ,  the payoff could be worth the price.<br />EA announced Monday afternoon that it has struck a deal to acquire  Glu Mobile  for $2.4 billion in cash. It is the videogame publisher’s second billion-dollar deal in as many months, following its surprise $1.25 billion takeout of U.K.-based racing-game maker  Codemasters  in December. Glu is EA’s largest deal to date, beating out the $1.3 billion spent on PopCap Games in 2011.<br />That deal also represented the last major attempt by EA to boost its mobile business. Since the iPhone ushered in the era of touch-screen mobile gaming in 2008, EA has made several moves to establish its position in a market that many observers believed would overtake consoles and PCs as the most dominant gaming platform. Smaller deals such as the acquisitions of game makers Firemint and Chillingo in 2010 and 2011 gave EA some popular games at the time such as “Flight Control” and “Real Racing.”<br />But EA never developed a Midas touch for mobile. Part of the problem came from the evolution of the mobile business away from games based on paid downloads and toward free-to-play titles that generate revenue from in-game transactions. Case in point: While buying PopCap gave EA control of the pioneering match-three game “Bejeweled,” it was “Candy Crush” that later came to dominate that category. EA’s rival  Activision Blizzard  acquired “Candy Crush” maker King Digital in 2015 and now generates more than $2 billion a year in mobile net bookings. EA’s mobile net bookings were just $779 million in calendar-year 2020.<br />Including Glu would have brought that total to about $1.3 billion. Doug Creutz of Cowen estimates the deal will make EA the seventh-largest mobile-game publisher. But simply adding games such as “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood” and “Diner Dash” to EA’s roster won’t justify the effort; Mr. Creutz says the real question is whether EA can effectively use Glu’s talent to enhance its other mobile properties.</td>

Chief People Officer Brent Hyder said Salesforce’s changes would include revamping office layouts to increase collaboration space instead of having a “sea of desks.” Mock-ups of its new offices feature café-style seating, open-air conference areas and private nooks, with an emphasis on clean desks and social distancing.<br />“We’re not going back to the way things were,” Mr. Hyder said in an interview. “I don’t believe that we’ll keep every space in every city that we’re in, including San Francisco.”<br />Salesforce expects more than 65% of its workforce to come into the office only one to three days a week in the future, up from 40% before the pandemic. An unspecified number of additional employees would be fully remote.<br />The company is the largest private employer in San Francisco and occupies the city’s tallest building, known as Salesforce Tower, and others with similar names in cities including Indianapolis, New York and Chicago. The company declined to say how much its real-estate footprint might shrink as a result of its changes.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Wall Street’s main regulator will give more power to its enforcement staff to launch investigations, an early sign that it plans to become more assertive under the Biden administration.<br />The move by the Securities and Exchange Commission allows more enforcement supervisors to authorize investigations, permitting about 36 senior officials at the agency to subpoena companies and individuals for records or testimony. The agency during the Trump administration withdrew that authority from supervisors and allowed only two officials to approve new probes, saying it would result in more consistent decisions about which tips and complaints justified investigations.<br />“Returning this authority to the division’s experienced senior officers, who have a proven track record of executing it prudently, helps to ensure that investigative staff can work effectively to protect investors,” SEC acting Chair Allison Herren Lee said Tuesday.<br />The number of new investigations fell every year during the Trump administration, from 1,063 in 2016 to 827 in 2019, according to the most recent figures published by the SEC. The number of completed enforcement actions fell from 548 in 2016 to 405 in 2020, although it reached 526 in 2019.<br />Ms. Lee, who took over the agency last month when former Chairman Jay Claytonstepped down, earlier worked as an enforcement attorney based in the agency’s Denver office.

      <td>Setting policy at the state level seems to work better than letting cities jockey.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial will attract most of the attention this week, but perhaps the more important event for the country is the saga of Covid-19 vaccinations. The federal distribution of doses to the states hasn’t been an outright disaster, and neither have state efforts to put these doses into arms. After a slow start, there have been signs of progress in recent weeks. Still, governments could be doing better, and fixing what’s wrong can save many lives.<br />At the federal level, the main problems have been shifting information and poor advice to the states. On Jan. 12, for example, governors were told by then-Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar that the Trump administration would be releasing its stockpile of reserved doses. Relying on this assurance, many governors announced that their states would begin inoculating residents 65 and older. But it turned out that there was no stockpile to release, and governors had to change course.<br />Such shifts undermine public confidence and can lead to bad policy. In early January, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said that residents 65 to 74 would probably have to wait until March to get vaccinated. Then, according to a Washington Post report, Robert Redfield, who was director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, went to Annapolis and urged Mr. Hogan to start vaccinating seniors immediately. President Biden’s incoming coronavirus czar, Jeffrey Zients, reinforced this suggestion.<br />In response, Mr. Hogan announced that Marylanders 75 and older could start getting vaccinated immediately, followed a week later by those 65 to 74. This quadrupled the state’s eligible pool to more than two million, about 25 times the state’s weekly allotment of doses. The result, predictably, was a public-relations nightmare, as seniors tried to register for vaccinations that they had no realistic prospect of receiving.<br />As residents of Maryland and other states know, trying to sign up to get vaccinated takes residents to a bewildering multiplicity of online portals ranging from state and local public websites to hospitals and medical centers, pharmacies, and even supermarkets with clinics. Much of this confusion is the result of a federal failure that went unreported until recently.</td>

We’ve proved, by pandemic-driven necessity, that we can close the physical trading floor on a moment’s notice and maintain service without missing a beat. Similarly, the broader financial-services industry shuttered offices and shifted workforces, without hiccups, to remote locations.</td>

The Trump administration blocked the company from accessing American technology and sought to persuade allies that Huawei’s telecom gear presented national security risks.<br />Huawei’s lawsuit said the FCC’s ruling in December exceeded its authority and was “arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and not supported by substantial evidence.”<br />An FCC spokeswoman said, “Last year the FCC issued a final designation identifying Huawei as a national security threat based on a substantial body of evidence developed by the FCC and numerous U.S. national security agencies.

      <td>The deal, which updates health and safety protocols, brings back a couple of experimental features from 2020, but doesn’t include a DH in the National League or expanded playoffs</td>
      <td>With barely a week to spare until spring training starts, Major League Baseball has decided what the rules of the sport are going to be this season.<br />MLB and its players’ union reached an agreement on updated health and safety protocols that will govern baseball’s second pandemic season. The deal brings back a couple of experimental features from the truncated 2020 campaign: seven-inning doubleheaders and beginning all extra innings with a runner on second base.<br />But, at least as of now, the National League will not use the designated hitter in 2021 as it did last year. The expanded playoff format from 2020 will not return, either. Both ideas could well be part of baseball’s next collective bargaining agreement, however.<br />The new rules that are sticking around were implemented to keep games short and accommodate the anticipated spate of postponements caused by positive coronavirus tests.<br />The revamped extra-innings format is designed to prevent the marathons that ravage bullpens and often require upward of four hours to finish. This rule had the intended effect during last year’s 60-game slate: About 71% of all extra-inning games last year ended after just one additional frame and only 2.6% needed more than three. In 2019, 18% of extra-inning games went on beyond the 12th.</td>

      <td>Nissan signaled a willingness to partner with the iPhone maker on Tuesday, after Hyundai said it was no longer in talks</td>
      <td>Many questions hang over  Apple Inc.’s  car project, but one thing is increasingly clear: The project won’t fail for lack of credible production partners.<br />Nissan  is the latest car maker to signal its openness to a deal. As technology transforms the auto industry, “we need to take new initiatives” and “work with companies that are knowledgeable, with good experience, through partnership and collaboration,” said Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida on Tuesday. This was in response to a question about his willingness to partner with Apple at a press conference to discuss the Japanese car maker’s quarterly results.<br />Speculation about the established automotive industry’s role in an Apple car project has spread since Hyundai dropped the big news that it was in talks with the iPhone maker last month. On Monday, those discussions seemed to have broken down, but Hyundai’s stock is still up 23% this year. Apple might not rely on just one supplier, though, and has also held discussions with Japanese manufacturers, according to a report in the Nikkei newspaper last week.<br />Nissan stock has rallied in recent days. There was little in its quarterly results to justify the excitement: The company’s turnaround is moving forward, but it nonetheless downgraded its revenue expectations for its fiscal year through March, noting the global semiconductor shortage. Yet Nissan, among the Japanese auto makers, is “the most likely candidate to be in serious discussions with Apple,” according to Mio Kato, an equity analyst who publishes on the Smartkarma research platform. Having overexpanded in the U.S. in recent years, Nissan has spare capacity to fill.<br />It is far too early for investors to be betting on car-manufacturing contracts from Apple. Unlike smartphones, vehicles are safety-critical devices. Self-driving technology—a common feature in reports on Apple’s car project—is still in its infancy. Returns from companies involved in the smartphone supply chain have also been very volatile. Those who buy auto stocks for the Apple halo alone are setting themselves up for disappointment.</td>

      <td>Over-reliance on TSMC and soaring cost of old gear limits capacity expansion</td>
      <td>The production shortage plaguing the market for automotive chips is a combination of new and old problems, none of which can be easily solved.<br />Ford Motor  last week was the latest auto maker to show the fallout. The company said Thursday that it is cutting production by up to 20% in the first quarter due to its inability to procure enough chips. Rival General Motors said a day earlier that it planned to trim production at North American factories due to the shortage.  Volkswagen  sounded an early warning in December about the issue, which is affecting auto makers across the board that need chips to control everything from infotainment systems to power management to systems monitoring.<br />The problem stems from actions both recent and distant. A sudden drop-off in sales caused auto manufacturers to cut component orders early in the pandemic. Then demand rebounded at an unfortunate time as chip manufacturers were operating at capacity to produce components for hot, high-price items such as the latest generation of iPhones and artificial intelligence chips for data centers. Industry giant  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ,  or TSMC, said in its earnings call last month that the automotive market accounted for only 3% of its revenue in the fourth quarter compared with 51% for smartphones and 31% for high-performance computing chips.<br />The firm said on the same call that improving production for auto chips is a “top priority.” But the harsh reality is that chips for cars have to compete for manufacturing space with other products that generate a much higher return.  Nvidia ,  a major TSMC customer, sells some of its latest gaming processors for several hundred dollars apiece, whereas many of the microcontrollers used in the world’s automobiles can fetch a dollar or less. Even cheap chips can have expensive consequences, though. Stephen Sanghi, chief executive of auto chip supplier  Microchip Technology ,  noted in his own call last week that “a $1 part can prevent a $40,000 car from shipping.”<br />Chip fabrication plants generally take more than two years to set up and the soaring cost of building and equipping them has led more semiconductor companies to outsource more of their production needs. Renesas, NXP and  Infineon -Cypress, which together account for nearly 80% of the automotive chip market, all use TSMC for some of their manufacturing. The Taiwanese firm now produces about 70% of the microcontroller units used in the world’s automobiles, estimates Phil Amsrud of  IHS Markit .</td>

      <td>Total’s prudent management in recent years set it up well for the trauma of 2020</td>
      <td>French giant Total may be the best of a bad bunch in the unloved oil-and-gas sector.<br />The company weathered a traumatic year for the oil industry better than European peers  Shell  and  BP ,  annual results released Tuesday confirmed. The sector isn’t for the faint of heart as the world transitions to cleaner forms of energy, but Total seems well set up for a range of scenarios.<br />The company is the second-largest producer of liquefied natural gas, and added significant finds to its oil and gas reserves last year. Yet it is also developing a new-energy business. It has converted some refineries to biodiesel and is investing in renewable assets. It has trading and retail services, and is dabbling in batteries, electric-vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon-capture technologies.<br />So much activity could raise the risk of poor delivery, but Total’s results have been steady so far. It has the advantages of low production costs and a solid balance sheet. The company has been buying businesses in various industries around the globe for years, but resisted overextending itself, as Shell did with the 2016 purchase of BG Group. It also hasn’t had to digest the vast cost of large oil spills, as BP did with the disasters in Alaska in 2006 and the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.<br />Investors used to prize oil companies for their stable and growing dividends. Both Shell and BP cut their payouts as the pandemic hit oil demand, but Total didn’t and now offers a sector-leading 7.5% dividend yield. The payments are sustainable at a $40 a barrel oil price, management said.</td>

      <td>Last year, after the pandemic hit, New York City’s startup scene went quiet—for about a month. Then it went into overdrive. In 2020, local startup funding broke records. Depending on which report you read, investors injected between $12 billion and $20 billion into area startup companies.<br />So what’s getting funded in New York these days? Better to ask what isn’t getting funded. Among the rounds that closed in 2020: $47 million for a hair-loss-prevention service, $9 million for a company making human-grade cat food, $6.25 million for a podcast company focusing on romantic comedies and $150,000 for a maker of bathroom-cleaning robots.<br />And thanks to a big wave of IPOs and acquisitions, local venture capitalists and angel investors are swimming in cash and likely to continue the funding frenzy this year.<br />So here’s what I’m wondering: How can I get me some of that loot?<br />I asked industry insiders for tips. The good news: You don’t need to be a tech type, it seems, to impress a New York City VC. While the San Francisco Bay Area startup scene is dominated by nerds, startup founders in New York look a lot like, well, the rest of us. The people who get funding here often are escapees from industries such as finance, real estate, health care and retail.</td>

A fierce argument has erupted between well-known left-leaning economists about President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package, with warnings that it is so large it risks runaway inflation and the crowding out of other, more productive, spending plans.<br />The concerns being voiced by Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary to Bill Clinton and director of Barack Obama’s National Economic Council, and Olivier Blanchard, former IMF chief economist, are perfectly reasonable arguments. After all, it comes just weeks after a $900 billion stimulus by the departing president.<br />Yet, markets show no sign of concern, either in the average expectation of inflation implied by the bond market or the likelihood of very high inflation in the options market, both of which are merely back to where they stood in 2018.<br />Investors are predicting the sort of inflation they like, slightly higher in the next few years but moderating back down after that, and it’s helping stocks and commodities while limiting the pain to bondholders from rising yields.<br />Investors have four reasons to take comfort that are at least as good as Messrs.

He assailed the Democratic governor’s business closures and mask mandates, raising his profile in the process. He is now considering a run for governor next year.<br />State Sen. Jim Brewster, a Democrat, urged people to follow health guidelines and government rules, a stance he said nearly cost him his seat last November. A frequent party-crosser during his 10 years in office, he said the pandemic has changed how he views his fellow lawmakers. “I’m done working with people who have an agenda,” he said.<br />The public-health crisis approaching the one-year mark upended how Americans live. It has also deepened the divide between Republicans and Democrats at the national level, polls have shown, and in Pennsylvania, an electoral battleground where control of state government is split between the parties. That partisanship worsened after many locally elected Republicans supported former President Donald Trump’s unfounded assertions that the election was stolen from him.<br />“It was the perfect storm—an election year, people’s lives turned upside down from the long pandemic of things,” said state Rep. Torren Ecker, a Republican who represents part of south-central Pennsylvania. “It’s all led to some tension, to say the least.”<br />Politicians from both parties believe the rift started at the top: Republicans say Democrats focused on the pandemic as a way to make Mr. Trump look bad and went too far in placing restrictions on businesses. Democrats say Republicans followed Mr. Trump’s lead and didn’t take the virus seriously enough and pushed to prematurely reopen the economy.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—The jets that landed in Australia from China were made to look inconspicuous: no corporate logos to indicate that wealthy gamblers were inside.<br />According to a report released by an Australian regulator Tuesday, it was a deliberate attempt by an executive at Australian casino operator  Crown Resorts Ltd.  to evade the Chinese government, which in early 2015 had announced a crackdown on foreign casinos recruiting Chinese high-rollers to gamble overseas.<br />The plan didn’t work, and Chinese police later arrested 19 Crown employees, accusing them of gambling-related crimes. Tuesday’s report said Crown disregarded the welfare of its employees in China by pursuing lucrative high-rollers even as the Chinese police were closing in, and concluded that Crown isn’t suitable to hold a license for a new casino in Sydney without making significant changes to its corporate culture.<br />The 751-page report, based on 60 days of public hearings that included Crown executives, offers an unusually in-depth look at the inner workings of an industry that has a reputation for being anything but transparent. The report  also found that bank accounts at Crown’s subsidiaries were used to launder money. In addition, Crown worked with so-called junket operators in Asia to bring high-rollers to Australia, even after learning of allegations in media reports and the company’s own due diligence that those groups had ties to organized crime, the report said.<br />As early as 2014, Crown’s bankers raised warnings of suspicious deposits in its bank accounts, such as multiple deposits on the same day by the same person at different branches in the same city, the report said. But Crown at the time didn’t change how the bank accounts operated or were monitored, the report said. Account details were given to Crown patrons, whose deposits would be credited to their account at the relevant casino.</td>

It also shows how decades of immigration into Europe has transformed the continent’s demographics and is reshaping politics in unexpected ways.<br />The finding, in a new study by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a think tank linked to Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union shows a majority of people of migrant origin in the country favor conservative, free-market or even far-right parties.<br />“We are seeing a process of normalization,” said Viola Neu, the author of the study. As migrants become economically and culturally more integrated, get naturalized and gain the right to vote, they tend to shift support from the center-left to the center-right, she said.<br />“People with immigrant backgrounds now vote like the majority does—not as a group tied to their origin, but according to their values and personal preferences,” she added.</td>

      <td>Some of the world’s biggest investors were on the cusp of a multibillion-dollar windfall from their bets on Ant Group Co. Now they are stuck with shares that won’t pay off soon.<br />In 2018, an exclusive group of global private-equity firms and mutual-fund managers including Silver Lake, Warburg Pincus LLC,  Carlyle Group Inc.  and  T. Rowe Price Group Inc.  took part in a coveted fundraising by Ant that raised $14 billion and minted the financial-technology giant as the world’s most valuable startup.<br />More than $10 billion of the money came from international investors, which bought shares in an offshore shell company set up by Ant to raise funds in U.S. dollars. The unusual arrangement came about because in order to secure a payment license to operate Alipay, its highly popular mobile app, Ant had to be domiciled in mainland China. But that also limited the company’s ability to raise funds directly from foreign investors.<br />The global investors agreed to terms that were highly favorable to Ant, and which limited their ability to cash out if the company didn’t end up going public, according to people familiar with the matter. Ant also didn’t provide a listing time frame or guarantee investors a return while it stayed private, the people added.<br />The foreign investors didn’t receive any voting rights in Ant, which was valued at $150 billion in the June 2018 deal. None was given a seat on Ant’s board.</td>

      <td>In a daring, high-speed swan dive from space, the first interplanetary probe from an Arab nation will attempt to enter orbit around Mars on Tuesday, to be followed closely in coming days by ambitious missions to the red planet from the U.S. and China.<br />The United Arab Emirates’ 1.5-ton, SUV-size satellite, called al-Amal, or Hope, carries three sensors designed to make the first comprehensive weather observations across the planet’s surface. The $200 million mission is the keystone of a national effort to make science and technology mainstays of the small Gulf state’s economy in anticipation of a day when its oil revenues dwindle, U.A.E. officials said.<br />“It’s about stimulating a lot of change within the U.A.E.’s economy that today more than ever should have a solid foundation in science,” said Sarah al-Amiri, Emirati minister of state for advanced sciences and chair of the U.A.E. Space Agency. “The best way to do that, from what we have been experimenting with as a nation, has been an exploration mission to space.”<br />In the most critical moment of its 306 million mile journey from Earth, which began in July with the launch of a Japanese rocket that lofted it into space, the Hope spacecraft on Tuesday was scheduled to fire its onboard thrusters for 27 minutes to reach a stable orbit around Mars. The maneuver was to be controlled autonomously by onboard computers, because the 22-minute time lag in radio transmissions between the craft and Earth made ground control impossible.<br />“It’s the first time we actually use all six thrusters and our whole control system,” mission project manager Omran Sharaf at the Emirates’ Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre in Dubai said in advance of the maneuver. “My feelings? Very very nervous. Extremely nervous. Worried. Scared. But I am also confident. Happy. Proud.”</td>

The firm forecasts £48 billion, equivalent to about $66 billion, worth of investment this year, up 30% from £37 billion in 2020.<br />Colliers International  is a bit more bullish, predicting commercial property investment in the U.K. will accelerate by 36%.</td>

      <td>The pandemic is compelling a number of co-working firms to discard original business models, or accelerate the adoption of a new one, with the broader office market under threat.<br />The original strategy, popularized by WeWork and many of its peers, involved leasing as much office space in city centers as possible, and then effectively subletting it to companies for a profit. This approach led to spectacular growth and sent WeWork’s valuation soaring to $47 billion.<br />With the majority of office employees still working from home during Covid-19, demand has plummeted. But co-working firms remain on the hook for the expensive long-term leases they signed during the boom years, and many are struggling to meet these obligations. Knotel Inc. became the industry’s biggest victim yet of this mismatch when it filed for Chapter-11 bankruptcy last month.<br />Now, some analysts suggest the pandemic is accelerating the end of the industry’s lease-and-sublet model. “The business model was similar to picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, which history has shown isn’t a sustainable strategy,” said Daniel Ismail, a senior analyst at research firm Green Street.<br />Instead, he expects revenue-sharing agreements to become more common. They are similar to the relationship between hotel owners and operators, where operators get fees and a share of profits but don’t have to pay rent. Revenue-sharing deals are considered less risky because they leave operators with lower fixed costs.</td>

Mr. Aguzin, 52 years old, will take the helm of what is now the world’s most valuable exchange group, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, with a rally in its own shares lifting its market capitalization to around $85 billion.<br />Mr. Aguzin is an Argentine national who also holds a Croatian passport and has permanent residence in Hong Kong. He doesn’t speak Mandarin—unlike his Beijing-born predecessor Charles Li, who led HKEX from 2010 to the end of last year.<br />The appointment of a foreigner underscores the exchange’s global ambitions and its independence, amid concerns about Beijing’s growing influence on the city, said Paul Pong, managing director at Pegasus Fund Managers Ltd.<br />“It helps strengthen the image of Hong Kong as an international financial center,” said Mr. Pong. He said Mr. Aguzin’s strengths would be complemented by those of HKEX Chairman Laura Cha, who has strong connections in mainland China as a former vice chairman of China’s securities watchdog.</td>

Online shopping volume had been growing at 15% annually up until the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the data analytics firm Green Street. Last year it increased by about 35%, Green Street said.</td>

      <td>Bank investors appear to be focused on expenses right now, but that might not be the right way to gauge which lenders will be best positioned for the future</td>
      <td>Banks and credit-card lenders need consumers to get spending. But they might need to do some spending of their own, too.<br />As credit measures continue to perform much better than feared, with still-low delinquency rates and rising loan-loss provision releases, investors seem to have found another reason to be worried about banks: their noninterest expenses. Fourth-quarter expenses at the very largest banks as a percentage of revenue rose by 3 points year over year on a median basis, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group. Out of 24 large banks’ earnings tracked by Autonomous Research, analysts’ consensus forecasts for 2021 expenses have risen for 22. Higher costs eat away at preprovision net revenue, which is already depressed by low interest rates and tepid loan growth.<br />It is true that banks have had their cost issues, highlighted recently by the recent focus on financial-crime monitoring, plus a continuing surge of fintech competition that forces banks to continually beef up their technology. But investors still may not be best served over the longer term by being too focused on margins right now, especially amid the earnings noise of the pandemic and its related effects. Certain spending today might be the key to outperformance in the post-pandemic future.<br />Card companies, in particular, ought to be viewed over a longer time horizon, given depressed customer spending in key categories such as travel. Take  American Express ,  for example: Falling expenses that vary with customer activity offset around 40% of the decline in the company’s revenue in the fourth quarter, down from about 50% earlier in 2020, the company said in January. But part of what was behind that smaller offset was an increased use of cardholder benefits—a sign that even as many spenders may not be doing the kind of shopping on travel and entertainment they once were, they still get value out of their cards. That is a possible sign of pent-up demand and a longer-term return to normal card behavior.<br />Likewise,  Capital One Financial  might look much more efficient at higher consumer-activity levels. The company said in January that some of its technology investment was aimed at more effective customer marketing, and it outlined a strategy of generating more new accounts now, with the longer-term aim of giving customers larger credit lines in a better economy. Credit cards are a rare kind of lending in which margins can stay strong even amid low rates, so banks will need to do a lot of it as demand returns.</td>

Losing them would shrink the Trump Organization’s business, just as it has struggled with the decline in travel and leisure spending due to the coronavirus pandemic. A sale could benefit Mr. Trump’s businesses, which have more than $400 million in debt due in the next few years.<br />Vornado Realty Trust  executives have recently had internal discussions about buying out the Trump Organization’s 30% stakes in an office tower in Midtown Manhattan and in a property in San Francisco’s financial district that the companies jointly own, people familiar with the matter said. Vornado tried unsuccessfully to sell the properties last year. A plan to refinance them was shelved.<br />When no buyers or lenders stepped up, the firm grew concerned that they were staying away because of the Trump Organization’s stake, said people familiar with the matter.<br />Vornado has weighed finding a reason to withhold income generated by the properties from the Trump Organization, a move that could force a confrontation that sends both parties to court and accelerates a separation, these people said.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Hong Kong’s highest court has denied bail to pro-democracy newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai, the most prominent figure facing prosecution under a sweeping national-security law imposed by Beijing to silence opposition after a year of unrest.<br />The ruling means that Mr. Lai could potentially spend the rest of his life behind bars if convicted. The businessman and longtime critic of China’s Communist Party is charged with foreign collusion, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The decision also signals that courts will set a high standard for granting bail to anyone charged under the national-security law.<br />Mr. Lai, who is in his early 70s, is among a handful of defendants heading to trial under a law imposed last year—and was the only one so far that a judge had released on bail pending trial. His case is being watched closely in mainland China and in Hong Kong as a test of how the law will be enforced in the former British colony, which has largely governed itself and retained its U.K.-style legal system since its return to China in 1997.<br />China’s state-backed media reacted with outrage in December after a lower-court judge granted bail to Mr. Lai shortly after his arrest. Mr. Lai also faces a fraud charge. He denies the charges.<br />China’s Communist Party mouthpiece The People’s Daily called Mr. Lai dangerous and castigated local courts for misreading the national-security law, which sets strict conditions for bail. The column suggested mainland authorities might invoke new powers under the law to pull Mr. Lai’s case out of Hong Kong’s legal system and try him in the mainland.</td>

Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, have previously sided with Democrats on a question related to the constitutionality of trying the former president.<br />The House voted to impeach Mr. Trump last month, alleging he encouraged the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 as part of a last-gasp effort to overturn President Biden’s election victory. The article of impeachment points to a speech Mr. Trump gave at a rally preceding the riot where he urged supporters to “fight” and march to the Capitol.<br />Sixty-seven votes are required to convict Mr. Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats. Only a handful of Republicans have indicated they could vote guilty.</td>

Higher-wage sectors hire and fire more slowly.”<br />The Labor Department on Tuesday will separately release its job openings data for December.</td>

And Mr. Bononi’s income as a behavioral-health counselor isn’t enough by itself to cover their monthly mortgage payment of roughly $2,000 on top of their other expenses.<br />Mortgage forbearance has been a financial lifeline for many Americans navigating the pandemic-ravaged economy, allowing homeowners to eliminate what is often their largest bill for months at a time. But the relief programs, largely designed to last a maximum of 12 months, are set to expire in the coming months, a serious challenge for borrowers who are still out of work or are earning less than they did pre-pandemic.<br />More than half of 2.7 million active forbearance plans are set to end for good in March, April, May or June, according to mortgage-data firm  Black Knight Inc.<br />“The biggest concern in my eyes is the number of folks whose forbearance programs are going to end this spring,” said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Haus, a home-finance startup. “Those that were hit the hardest early on and still haven’t found a job are going to be in dire straits.”</td>

Others are scoring shoppers based on their return rates, much the way credit-ratings firms tally consumers’ creditworthiness.<br />Behind the push is a painful economic reality of e-commerce. The share of online purchases that are returned averages 30% or higher, depending on the category, three times the rate in physical stores, according to industry executives.<br />“There was a huge shift to online shopping, and the numbers won’t go back to where they were before the pandemic,” said Oliver Lange, who runs H&Mbeyond, the brand’s innovation lab.<br />Consumers got comfortable buying everything from groceries to makeup online, as brick-and-mortar stores temporarily shut and anxiety mounted about spending time indoors.

Futures for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index slipped 0.1%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts drifted down less than 0.1%.<br />Investors said markets are taking a breather following a broad advance in stocks and commodities. The recent rally has been fueled by expectations of a new dose of stimulus spending in the U.S., which could add impetus to the economic revival. That has helped pare expectations for turbulence in U.S. stocks, sending the Cboe Volatility Index down this week to less than 22, after the gauge surged to over 37 at the end of January.<br />“Very small downsized moves are a symptom of low volatility,” said Trevor Greetham, head of multiasset at U.K. investment firm Royal London Asset management. “Low and falling volatility is a bull market phenomenon. You do get quiet days.”<br />Expectations that the economy will revive this year have prompted money managers to bet stocks will continue to power higher, driven by sectors such as energy, banks and consumer companies that are sensitive to the growth.</td>

He discussed the plan with then-lead director Kenneth Duberstein and board member David Calhoun, now Boeing’s CEO, according to internal emails cited in the suit.<br />Around the same time, Boeing was publicly pointing to pilot and maintenance errors as important factors in the fatal plunge of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia, even as it was privately beginning work on a fix to an automated flight-control system implicated in that crash. The system, called MCAS, later also led to a second MAX crash in early 2019 in Ethiopia.<br />The new details, contained in a recently amended version of a shareholder lawsuit filed against Boeing’s board in Delaware’s Court of Chancery, included inner workings at the highest levels of the company as it became embroiled in one of the biggest corporate crises in modern American history. U.S. regulators late last year allowed the MAX to resume passenger flights, ending a nearly two-year grounding.<br />A Boeing spokesman on Monday said the company was seeking to dismiss the shareholders’ suit, which he said lacked merit. He said Boeing was dedicated to safety, quality and integrity and that the company’s senior management and board had engaged in “robust safety oversight,” including extensive reviews of engineering, airplane-development and production processes. He said Boeing had improved safety, quality and compliance since the MAX crisis.</td>

Previously it was valued at $3 billion after its last funding round in February 2019, according to PitchBook, a provider of private-market data. Current investors in Reddit also include venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and internet conglomerate  Tencent Holdings Ltd.<br />“It’s a good market to fundraise,” Reddit Chief Executive Steve Huffman said in an interview. “Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there’s an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year.” For example, advertising revenue for the company shot up 90% in the December-ended quarter from a year earlier, he said.<br />The funding for Reddit comes just weeks after upstart audio-chat social network Clubhouse raised fresh capital. Clubhouse was valued at $1 billion last month after securing $100 million in a funding round led by Andreessen, according to PitchBook.<br />San Francisco-based Reddit, founded in 2005, is known for its message boards on a multitude of topics, as well as its “ask me anything” digital town halls with celebrities, politicians and subject-matter experts. The company, which isn’t profitable, was sold to Condé Nast in 2006, and the magazine publisher’s parent, Advance Publications Inc., spun Reddit off in 2011 and remains a shareholder. The company has raised roughly $800 million since 2011.</td>

      <td>Bogotá, Colombia—President Iván Duque’s conservative government said Monday that it will provide nearly a million undocumented Venezuelan migrants with temporary protected status, giving them the right to live and work in this country for 10 years.<br />Mr. Duque made the announcement after meeting with the head of the United Nations refugee agency, which has pressed Latin American countries to legalize and provide services for millions of Venezuelan who have fled an economic crisis that has worsened under President Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian rule.<br />“We hope that other countries follow our example,” Mr. Duque said at a news conference in which he cited Pope Francis’s calls for countries to help and not turn back migrants fleeing wars and deprivation.<br />Mr. Duque, a leading opponent of the Maduro regime, called the measure an act of solidarity with struggling Venezuelans. “We have to take actions—not actions based on fear or rejection, but with fraternity,” the president said.<br />Colombia has taken in more than 1.7 million Venezuelans, hundreds of thousands of whom are here legally. They make up roughly one-third of the more than 5 million Venezuelan refugees dispersed around the region, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, discussing regional security issues that revolve around China and the upheaval in Myanmar, the White House said.<br />The two leaders agreed to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, “including support for freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and a stronger regional architecture through the Quad,” the White House said in a statement about the call, referring to the four-nation group that also includes Japan and Australia.<br />Although China wasn’t mentioned by the White House, increased Chinese patrols around Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea last year steered the democracies toward heightened cooperation. The Quad reformed in 2017 in part to address a rising China.<br />The Chinese embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Indian government said in a statement the leaders “discussed at length regional developments and the wider geo-political context” and “reiterated the importance of working with like-minded countries to ensure a rules-based international order and a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.”<br />Messrs. Biden and Modi also discussed the upheaval in Myanmar as well as Covid-19 and climate change, according to the White House.</td>

      <td>They already know the result, but they think it will hurt the GOP.</td>
      <td>The Senate on Tuesday begins the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, now the former President. Democrats say the trial is crucial to punishing Mr. Trump for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, but it seems more likely to do the opposite by acquitting him. It also looks like a needless partisan exercise that will further polarize America’s political factions.<br />As we’ve said several times, Mr. Trump’s actions that day and after the November election were disgraceful. He made false claims about a stolen election and later about overturning the Electoral College count. He also misled his supporters about Vice President Mike Pence’s solely ceremonial role in presiding over the vote count.<br />By rallying his supporters to march on the Capitol in the false hope of overturning the election result, and then refusing for hours to ask them to stand down, Mr. Trump tolerated an assault on a constitutional branch of government. Republicans who think this is impeachable conduct will get no criticism from us.<br />Yet the House impeachers don’t limit themselves to that charge. In their single and sloppy impeachment article, they accuse Mr. Trump of “incitement of insurrection.” This is a stretch, not least because Mr. Trump called on the marchers to behave “peacefully.” The House managers mention this only in passing in their trial brief. It is doubtful that Mr. Trump’s Jan. 6 remarks would qualify as incitement under the criminal code.<br />The assault on the Capitol was a riot, and a violent one, but it wasn’t an “insurrection.” It wasn’t a coup. Law enforcement was overwhelmed but it was all on the side of the Congress. Once the mob was dispersed, the Members returned to the House chamber to count the votes. There was never any chance that Joe Biden would not become President on Jan. 20, whatever the fantasies of Mr. Trump and his courtiers.</td>

      <td>How many jobs for the young and unskilled do Democrats want to lose?</td>
      <td>President Biden says his priority is creating new jobs and he wants “to grow the economy for all Americans.” But look at how the Congressional Budget Office sizes up his proposal for a $15 federal minimum wage. Phasing in this mandatory wage floor by 2025, according to the CBO’s new average estimate, would result in a loss of 1.4 million jobs.<br />The idled workers would be disproportionately younger and less educated, and CBO projects that half of them would drop out of the labor force. Prices would also rise for goods and services that rely on entry-level labor, “such as food prepared in restaurants.” The federal budget deficit through 2031 would increase $54 billion, CBO says, as the government spent more on unemployment benefits and health-care programs.<br />Low-wage employees lucky enough to keep their jobs would get a raise. CBO says 17 million workers would be “directly affected” by the $15 minimum, and poverty “would be reduced by 0.9 million.” This is not a free lunch, no matter how often Mr. Biden and Bernie Sanders say so. Those gains would come at a high cost for the young and unskilled who will have a harder time grabbing the first rung of the economic ladder.<br />Even those figures are a guess, since setting the minimum wage at a high of $15 would essentially put the country through an economic experiment. This would mean imposing the urban labor costs of San Francisco and Manhattan on every out-of-the-way gas station in rural America. The U.S. economy is made up of local and regional labor markets with prevailing wage rates that depend on varying standards of living, the kinds of employers, and the availability and skill of the workforce. Some 20 states have a minimum wage no higher than the current national minimum of $7.25.<br />The good news is that the $15 wage’s route through Congress looks bumpy. Mr. Biden told  CBS  he’s willing to push a $15 wage floor in separate legislation, but he doesn’t think it’ll pass buried in his $1.9 trillion Covid bill: “Apparently that’s not going to occur because of the rules of the United States Senate.”</td>
