      <td>Tech giant will host cloud services for GM’s autonomous-vehicle subsidiary; financing brings Cruise’s valuation to $30 billion</td>
      <td>Microsoft Corp.  is investing in  General Motors Co. ’s driverless-car startup Cruise as part of a strategic tie-up, another sign of renewed interest in the autonomous-technology space after a relatively quiet period.<br />Microsoft is among a group of companies that will invest more than $2 billion in San Francisco-based Cruise, which has been majority-owned by GM since early 2016. The financing brings Cruise’s valuation to $30 billion, Cruise said Tuesday, up from an estimated $19 billion in spring 2019.<br />GM is adding to its Cruise investment as part of the funding round and will retain a majority stake, a Cruise spokesman said. The investment also includes current stakeholder  Honda Motor Co.  and other institutional investors that Cruise declined to name.<br />Under terms of Tuesday’s deal, Cruise will use Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing service to help it roll out autonomous-vehicle services. Cruise for years has been testing driverless cars in San Francisco and plans an eventual robot-taxi service. It is also is exploring commercial delivery.<br />Driverless cars are expected to throw off troves of data for autonomous-service operators to capture, store and eventually monetize, analysts say. Even on today’s cars, auto makers and tech companies are mobilizing to harness data from the growing number of vehicles with internet connections.</td>

      <td>New directive, aimed at a 2020 Supreme Court ruling, comes in the waning moments of the Trump administration</td>
      <td>The Justice Department has issued a memo that aims to limit the impact of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that protects gay and transgender people in the workplace, a last-minute attempt by the Trump administration to influence policy as President-elect Joe Biden begins assembling new leadership at the agency.<br />The Supreme Court’s June ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County said a bedrock federal civil-rights law prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The 6-3 opinion, written by a Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch, rejected the administration’s arguments that federal civil rights law provides no protection to LGBT employees.<br />The new memo, dated Sunday and sent by the acting head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, acknowledges the court’s ruling was sweeping, but says the department should not extend it further to areas such as housing and education, where longstanding gender-based policies on bathrooms and sports teams could come into play. The 23-page memo, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, also suggests that some employers could cite religious beliefs that would allow them to discriminate against LGBT employees.<br />“Unlike racial discrimination, the Supreme Court has never held that a religious employer’s decision not to hire homosexual or transgender persons ‘violates deeply and widely accepted views of elementary justice’ or that the government has a ‘compelling’ interest in the eradication of such conduct,” the memo says.<br />A DOJ spokeswoman didn’t have an immediately comment on the memo.</td>

Overall, Netflix signed up what it said was a record 37 million subscribers in 2020 and had a total of 203.7 million users when the year finished up.<br />The company’s subscriber count has roughly doubled since the third quarter of 2017, when it first exceeded 100 million paying customers.<br />The pandemic has charged Netflix’s growth as consumer cut back on a range of leisure activities—from dining out and vacations to visiting theaters and concert venues—to comply with lockdown orders and limit the risk of infection. With many people spending more time at home, streaming demand jumped, bolstering Netflix as well as its competitors.<br />The Los Gatos, Calif., company said it generated $6.64 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up from $5.45 billion for the year earlier and exceeding analysts’ forecasts. But profit decreased to $542 million, or $1.19 a share, from $587 million, or $1.30 a share, the year earlier. Analysts predicted $1.36 a share for the latest period, according to FactSet.</td>

      <td>ROME—Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte survived a confidence vote in the country’s Senate but fell short of an outright majority, weakening his government as it searches for a way to tame the Covid-19 pandemic and revive the economy.<br />The vote in the Senate was triggered by the decision of a small centrist party led by a former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to withdraw from the governing coalition. Mr. Renzi said he objected to Mr. Conte’s plans for spending more than 200 billion euros, equivalent to $243 billion, in European Union loans and grants to support the economic recovery after the pandemic.<br />Mr. Conte garnered 156 votes in favor of his left-leaning government and 140 against, with Mr. Renzi’s party abstaining. After falling short of an absolute majority in Italy’s 321-member Senate, Mr. Conte could struggle in the future when he seeks to pass legislation. The government previously relied on Mr. Renzi’s group for its Senate majority.<br />“We will have a weak government precisely when we would need a very strong one,” said Valentina Meliciani, an economics professor at LUISS University in Rome.<br />The government won a confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament on Monday, where it has a stronger majority. If Mr. Conte had lost the Senate vote he would have been forced to resign, paving the way to either a new governing coalition or a snap election, which opinion polls suggest the right-of-center opposition parties would win.</td>

Eleven officers suffered minor injuries in the incident, according to the officials, including a captain who was struck by a bottle.<br />Ms. James, who last week filed a lawsuit against the NYPD over its response to Black Lives Matter protests in New York City last year, said Tuesday that videos circulating on social media showed that officers acted too aggressively.<br />“Once again, we are seeing and hearing accounts of NYPD officers infringing on the rights of New Yorkers,” Ms. James said. “The images of officers using excessive force against peaceful protesters is alarming and cause for deep concern.”</td>

The complaint is among the first to charge multiple alleged members of the mob with conspiracy in connection with the events of Jan. 6.<br />Around eight to 10 people wearing helmets, reinforced vests and clothing with paraphernalia identifying themselves of the right-wing militia group Oath Keepers moved in a tactical fashion and forced their way to the front of the crowd, a video cited in the complaint shows.<br />During the breach, one of the members allegedly communicated: “We have a good group. We have about 30-40 of us. We are sticking together and sticking to the plan,” the new complaint said.</td>

They were provoked by the president and other powerful people and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday.<br />Mr. McConnell has said he is considering whether he would vote to convict Mr. Trump during his second impeachment trial, which will take place after Mr. Trump leaves office. The House passed an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump last week, focused on his statements encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol.<br />How Mr. McConnell votes will be central to whether enough Republicans join Democrats in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump. A two-thirds supermajority is needed to convict in presidential impeachment trials, meaning 17 Republicans would need to support conviction for it to succeed.<br />Some Republicans, though, have said they don’t believe that holding an impeachment trial for someone who no longer holds office is constitutional. Democrats will soon control a majority in the Senate.</td>

But Mr. Biden has already passed on an even greater opportunity. When  Facebook ,  YouTube,  Twitter  and Apple shut down competing social media; as banks declined to do business with President Trump; as pundits called for ostracizing all Trump administration officials from future employment; as CEOs at major American corporations rushed to decline commerce with people who dared voice their worry about the fairness of the presidential election, Mr. Biden could have taken the stage and shouted that enough was enough. He could have pounded the podium and told social-media companies to “stand down” and open their channels to all Americans again; scolded businesses that it isn’t “American” to close your markets to people with differing political opinions; declared that we don’t deny people who serve this country future employment because we see the world through a different political prism and demanded an end to self-aggrandizing attacks on the millions of our fellow citizens who voted for President Trump.<br />How could the social-media moguls and the Amazons, Citibanks and Targets of the world refuse such a request for unity? It would have been, and still might be, as historic a gesture as Abraham Lincoln’s call for unity as the Civil War drew to a close. But our newly elected president has done none of these things. If “great moments are born from great opportunities,” Mr. Biden is passing one up right now.<br />Todd M. Johnson<br />Edina, Minn.<br /></td>

      <td>Regarding Christopher DeMuth’s “The Electoral College Saved the Election” (op-ed, Jan. 9): Yes, the college “can elect someone who didn’t win the nationwide popular vote.” The more substantial distortion, however, is the “winner take all” approach adopted by 48 of the 50 states. This is the more significant reason for a result at odds with the popular vote.<br />The Electoral College “causes candidates to campaign heavily in ‘battleground states’ while ignoring those they think they are certain to carry or not.” Battleground states are entirely the result of “winner take all.” Take California—the most populous state and one that is overwhelmingly Democratic. Under “winner take all” it is a miracle that any presidential candidate, Republican or Democratic, campaigns there. If, on the other hand, electoral votes were allocated proportional to the statewide vote, essentially as in Maine and Nebraska, both candidates would spend a lot of time in California. Under a proportional allocation even the loser in California could garner a substantial number of electoral votes.<br />“Winner take all” is not part of the Electoral College nor is it to be found anywhere else in the Constitution. It is a creature of state law.<br />Finally, if even without the misconceptions one is still impelled to abolish the Electoral College, there is no reason to stop there. The Electoral College perfectly mirrors Congress, and the Senate should be the next to go.<br />John J. Ronayne</td>

He is widely expected to be confirmed to lead the State Department soon after Mr. Biden’s inauguration, aides say.</td>

      <td>LONDON—Iran sanctioned President Trump and nine other U.S. officials, in a parting shot against an outgoing administration that has pummeled the country and its top officials with sanctions.<br />Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that the U.S. officials were designated for their role in terrorist activities against Iran, including sanctions and last year’s killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Iraq.<br />The Iranian sanctions also targeted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former and current special representatives for Iran Brian Hook and Elliott Abrams, as well as former national security adviser John Bolton.<br />“This is a transparently political stunt by the Iranian government that does not deserve the seriousness of a substantive response,” a State Department spokeswoman said.<br />The Iranian sanctions will have limited impact as the targeted U.S. officials have no known commercial links to Iran. Yet the move shows Tehran’s desire for a last-minute public relations blow to Mr. Trump, who leaves office Wednesday.</td>

      <td>Appeals court ruling gives incoming Biden administration an opening to reset rules for addressing climate change</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal appeals court on Tuesday vacated the Trump administration’s rules that eased restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants, potentially making it easier for the incoming Biden administration to reset rules targeting climate emissions.<br />A 2-1 majority on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided to send the Affordable Clean Energy rule back to the Environmental Protection Agency, ruling the Trump administration adopted an unlawfully narrow view of federal clean-air law.<br />If upheld or unchallenged, the ruling would undo a major Trump administration environmental initiative that intended to give states and electric utilities more flexibility in how they reduced their emissions of heat-trapping gasses.<br />The decision could make it easier for President-elect Joe Biden to fulfill a campaign promise to put more stringent limits on the power industry’s emissions. Mr. Biden has called for eliminating carbon-dioxide emissions from the power sector by 2035, and Tuesday’s ruling would allow him to push toward doing so without first trying to repeal or overhaul a set of rules put in place by conservatives.<br />Power plant emissions have long been one of the top two U.S. sources of greenhouse-gas emissions, putting them in the crosshairs of attempts by government to address global warming. The rules vacated Tuesday were an attempt by the Trump administration to overhaul the first-ever U.S. rules on these emissions, the Clean Power Plan, put in place by the Obama administration.</td>

      <td>Things may improve for banks, but without loan demand, revenue growth will still be hard to come by</td>
      <td>Heading into 2021, it appears that things aren’t getting any worse for bank stocks. But it may be some time before they get much better.<br />Bank of America  executives on Tuesday suggested that the bank’s net interest income likely bottomed in the third quarter, rising about 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, and that the fourth quarter of 2021 will likely look much better than the first.  JPMorgan Chase  last week reported 2% quarter-over-quarter growth in net interest income, and expects a pickup in 2021 versus 2020. The two banks had reported 2020 declines of 11% and 5% in net interest income, respectively.<br />One reason for optimism, widely cited across banks, is how much cash banks can still shift into their securities portfolios. Even absent any pickup in loan demand, banks can continue to put cash generated by deposits into fixed-income securities that pick up more yield.<br />Still, the road to much improved interest income across banks isn’t straightforward. One challenge is that mortgages continue to be prepaid because of a surge in refinancing, which affects mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America cited this as having a significant impact on its net interest yield. Banks have so much cash to deploy that they can still make gains in yields net of this effect. But where mortgage rates go could be a huge swing factor.<br />There is certainly hope in the shape of the yield curve. Banks across the board noted the recent steepening of the curve, as long-term rates have risen, as a big benefit. For example, the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasuries is as wide as it has been since 2017. However, banks have reasons to be cautious about simply buying longer-term fixed-income securities, as this could cause them to miss out on future rate increases.</td>

Chuck Schumer, will meet Tuesday to iron out the details of a power-sharing agreement in a Senate divided evenly along party lines.<br />Georgia on Tuesday formally certified Democratic victories for its two recent Senate races, ensuring that Democrats will take control of the chamber for the first time since 2015. Democrats will formally gain the Senate majority once the three new senators from California and Georgia are sworn in on Wednesday afternoon, because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris wields a tiebreaking vote. The chamber already is moving ahead with the confirmation process for some of President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet nominees and is expected to hold an impeachment trial of President Trump, though its timing hasn’t been determined.<br />In the past, a 50-50 Senate has meant that while each party gets an equal number of committee seats, the majority party holds committee chairmanships and controls the agenda, setting the schedule for nominees and legislation to come to the floor for votes. When the Senate last had a power-sharing arrangement, in 2001, that meant that nominees and bills could advance to the floor even if a committee vote was tied. The arrangements this time around are still being negotiated, however, and it isn’t known what rules will be in place.<br />In addition to hashing out a power-sharing agreement, Messrs. McConnell (R., Ky.) and Schumer (D., N.Y.) will discuss a Covid-19 relief package and nominees, a person familiar with the matter said. Both Republicans and Democrats are looking to the 2001 arrangement as a model, this person said.<br />In remarks on the Senate floor at noon Tuesday, Mr. McConnell argued that November’s elections didn’t hand any side a mandate for broad ideological change.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The London Metal Exchange is proposing closing its open-outcry ring, where traders have swapped metals like copper and lead using shouts and hand signals for 144 years, in a bid to attract more financial players to its marketplace.<br />The LME temporarily closed the ring when Covid-19 ripped through the U.K. in March, judging the tight circle of red couches that dozens of traders crowd around to be a health risk. The exchange, owned by  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. , is now floating the idea of shutting the ring for good.<br />The ring began life when the LME was founded above a London hat shop in 1877, though its origins date to sawdust circles around which merchants bought and sold metals in the early 1800s, when they were in high demand as the industrial revolution gathered steam. It survived two world wars, the decline of the U.K. as the world’s leading industrial economy and the rise of China as the largest metals consumer.<br />However, the coronavirus pandemic may prove to be its undoing. Launching a consultation on the proposed closure Tuesday, the LME said electronic pricing had served the market well during the pandemic and would bring greater transparency around the way that prices are set.<br />The ring’s long-term survival in the face of electronic trading has long been debated. The LME had previously experimented with setting closing prices electronically on a small scale in the nickel market. Covid-19 prompted the exchange to run that trial across the gamut of metals and contract dates.</td>

The Chinese government has in the past denied mistreating the Uighur population, who mainly live in the Xinjiang region, and defended its program of detaining large numbers of Uighurs as necessary to root out terrorism and provide job-training.<br />Accusations of genocide by the State Department are rare, and the State Department declaration came on the Trump administration’s last day.

      <td>Justice Department alleges academic who appeared on CNN and NPR and met with U.S. officials received a salary from Iran</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Justice Department filed charges against an Iranian academic, alleging that he covertly drew a salary from the government of Iran while living and working in the U.S. as a professor, political scientist and Middle East expert.<br />In a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court, the government charged Kaveh Afrasiabi, an Iranian citizen with U.S. permanent residency, with two counts of acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Typically, first-time offenders receive well below the maximum penalty.<br />The government alleges that Mr. Afrasiabi has been receiving a salary—totaling at least $265,000—from the Iranian mission to the United Nations since at least 2007, and health-care benefits since at least 2011. During that time, the complaint says, he helped Iran shape its public messaging in the media and advocated Iranian government positions at the highest levels of U.S. government.<br />Mr. Afrasiabi made contact with numerous U.S. government officials without disclosing his ties to the Iranian government, according to the government, including an unnamed member of Congress and his staff as well as a senior official in the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.<br />Such consulting activity usually requires a public registration with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law designed to bring transparency to the advocacy work of foreign states. In recent years, the Justice Department has reinvigorated its enforcement of the foreign-agents law, charging a number of lobbyists, consultants, business figures and academics for failing to disclose their ties to foreign states or foreign income.</td>

      <td>Armin Laschet and his party hope to keep the boring times rolling.</td>
      <td>Germany took another step Saturday in its long transition to whatever will come after Angela Merkel, as the country’s largest party elected Armin Laschet as leader. As head of Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, Mr. Laschet is in pole position to succeed her as chancellor after October elections—for boring or worse.<br />This marks the CDU’s second attempt to find a political heir for Mrs. Merkel, after Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s ascent to the party leadership in late 2018. AKK, as she’s known, was Mrs. Merkel’s preferred successor but proved inept at managing tensions among factions within the CDU. A string of poor state election results for the CDU hastened her exit last year amid a ruckus over cooperation between some local CDU candidates and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).<br />With Mr. Laschet, the CDU is attempting the same policy strategy embodied by AKK. He represents continuity with Mrs. Merkel in almost all respects, from his timidity on domestic economic reforms to his sympathy for Russia and enthusiasm for closer economic ties with China. The party on Saturday again rebuffed Friedrich Merz, who ran against Mr. Laschet and against AKK in 2018 on a free-market reform platform. CDU convention delegates also knocked out foreign-policy hawk Norbert Röttgen.<br />It’s a bet that when they elect a new parliament this year, Germans will want more of Mrs. Merkel’s brand of wooly centrism. But if that turns out to be true, it will be by default. State election results and opinion polls suggest the CDU and its Bavarian sister the CSU remain Germany’s plurality party but with markedly diminishing support.<br />Meanwhile, German politics is drifting away from Mrs. Merkel’s breed of consensus. Despite winning a leadership election among delegates to the CDU party conference, Mr. Laschet’s soft foreign-policy views are increasingly at odds with prominent CDU figures who advocate a sterner approach to Russia and China. The Greens are on the rise as a mainstream center-left party on the back of their foreign-policy hawkishness and hostility to crony capitalism at home.</td>

      <td>Abolishing the tipped minimum wage would wipe out the benefit of his Covid grants.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden proposes $15 billion in relief grants for America’s Covid-crushed businesses. But he also wants to mandate a new minimum wage that for many restaurants would wipe out the benefit and then some.<br />Restaurants shed some six million jobs in the first two months of the pandemic. As a consequence of continued Covid-related closures and a decline in customer traffic, the industry ended 2020 with 2.5 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic. They received a temporary lifeline through the Paycheck Protection Program, but have advocated without success for more-substantial relief. Mr. Biden’s recovery plan acknowledges restaurants were “disproportionately” harmed by Covid.<br />But he also proposes to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, which more than doubles the existing minimum, $7.25 an hour. The separate minimum for tipped workers is $2.13 an hour, and the president-elect proposes to raise that to $15 too—an increase of more than 600%. Tipped workers are already required to earn the full federal minimum between their base wage and tips, and most earn far more.<br />The relief grants wouldn’t come close to offsetting this new mandate. Consider the math for a small full-service restaurant location in West Virginia with five servers, where the tipped-wage minimum is $2.62 an hour. Mr. Biden’s plan would raise the hourly cost of each server by $12.38, or $19,313 annually for a 30-hour workweek. With payroll taxes, that’s roughly $100,000 in new annual costs, compared with the average Covid relief grant of $15,000 per small business.<br />A recent study from economists at Miami and Trinity universities finds a plan like Mr. Biden’s would cost the hospitality industry more than one million jobs—including nearly 700,000 held by tipped workers. A Census Bureau study shows that restaurant workers see lower tips in states with a higher minimum wage, a likely consequence of restaurants’ transition towards self-service models. Unsurprisingly, tipped workers oppose Mr. Biden’s plan.</td>

      <td>To succeed, he’ll have to establish a chain of command and level with the public.</td>
      <td>Describing his plan to get the Covid-19 pandemic under control, Joe Biden was blunt. “You have my word,” the president-elect declared last week. “We will manage the hell out of this operation.” He had better. Anything less would be a body blow to his administration and the country.<br />When there is widespread agreement on a course of action, leaders are judged on how well they carry it out. In her 2016 book, “Why Presidents Fail,” my Brookings Institution colleague Elaine Kamarck shows how management failures can make or break presidencies. Jimmy Carter never recovered from the failed mission to rescue American hostages in Iran, nor did George W. Bush from his botched response to Hurricane Katrina. The implosion of the Affordable Care Act’s website significantly weakened the Obama presidency.<br />This is all the more important when policies affect individuals directly, because these policies inform how society perceives the competence of its institutions and leaders. Savvy politicians understand that attitudes toward government are shaped by motor-vehicle departments and Veterans Affairs hospitals. Members of Congress quickly learn that constituent services in their local offices matter at least as much as voting records. Helping constituents navigate complex bureaucracies affects not only them but the stories they tell their friends and neighbors.<br />You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and managing the pandemic will be the first impression President Biden makes. If he gets it right, he will strengthen his hand in dealing with a divided Congress, and he will begin the long task of rebuilding public trust and confidence in government. If his team botches the job, he will bear the brunt of public disappointment.<br />Mr. Biden has inherited a monumental challenge. The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed encouraged the development of vaccines in record time, but then hit a snag in logistics. The feds have shipped vaccines more slowly than expected. Many states have been inadequately prepared to pass out the vaccines they receive. Highly publicized instances of line-jumping threaten to weaken confidence in the fairness of the process.</td>

      <td>The World Health Organization was poorly prepared to prevent a disease like Covid-19 from becoming a pandemic, and wasn’t adapted for a globalized era of easy travel and extensive trade, an international panel said.<br />Years of warnings that the United Nations agency’s international system wasn’t ready for a respiratory pandemic went unheeded, former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, a co-chairwoman of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, said.<br />Ms. Clark is leading a panel that was set up last year, after a group of governments, organized by Australia, pushed for an investigation into how a virus first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan managed to spread and claim two million lives.<br />The panel’s preliminary findings, presented to the WHO on Tuesday, puts less blame on individual decisions taken by the agency’s leaders than on the weak international bureaucracy they inherited. Global health laws requiring countries rapidly share all pertinent information on an emerging threat “lacked teeth,” one of the panelists said. Complex bureaucratic rules, created to prevent the WHO from taking hasty decisions that could hurt the global economy, meant that several weeks were lost before the agency could declare Covid-19 an international public health emergency, Ms. Clark said.<br />“Viruses move in minutes and hours, rather than days and weeks, especially in the highly mobile and interconnected world of today,” said Ms. Clark. “The international system for alert and response has the trappings of an analogue system in a digital age.”</td>

Rowe Price Associates Inc. led the round, which also included Fidelity Investments, Coatue Management and  Amazon.com Inc.,  all of whom have already backed the auto maker, Rivian said Tuesday.

It wasn’t clear whether  Ford  participated in this round.<br />The new money will allow the company to focus on launching three products this year while scaling up for growth, said RJ Scaringe, Rivian’s founder and chief executive, in a statement.<br />The new funding round illustrates that the torrent of new investment into electric-vehicle companies shows no signs of slowing so far in 2021. Investors are betting smaller challengers can take on legacy auto makers, causing valuations for all electric-vehicle companies to balloon over the past year.</td>

      <td>Job cuts aimed at removing overlap arising from acquisition of TNT package-delivery business</td>
      <td>FedEx Corp.  plans to cut up to 6,300 jobs in Europe as it completes the process of combining its Express network with the package-delivery operations of its TNT unit.<br />The delivery company said Tuesday that it will lay off between 5,500 and 6,300 workers in operational and back-office roles as it seeks to address the overlap resulting from operating two European networks connecting similar geographies.<br />The proposed cuts could affect up to 2.6% of FedEx Express’ roughly 245,000 employees, including about 43,000 at TNT, as of May 31, 2020. The job cuts will differ by country and could be in the form of reassignment to other roles and priority access to open positions.<br />FedEx said it expects severance-benefits costs of between $300 million and $575 million, before taxes, that are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2023. The company sees savings of $275 million to $350 million annually beginning fiscal 2024 as a result of the job reductions.<br />FedEx bought TNT, a Dutch company, in 2016. FedEx at that time had a sizable air-express delivery operation in Europe, but it lagged behind in the ground-delivery business. Acquiring TNT gave it an established door-to-door network in Europe, saving the U.S.-based company the time and money required to build one from scratch.</td>

      <td>Upstart luxury liquidators like Heat and Scarce are offloading surplus clothing from labels like Off-White and Saint Laurent with a twist: The customers have no idea what they’re actually buying</td>
      <td>LAST YEAR, as part of a wave of retail-store closures, discount retailers Century 21 and Stein Mart filed for bankruptcy. Coronavirus, which slowed Americans’ shopping to a crawl, certainly played a part in their fall—and left many of the brands, stores and factories that had relied on these once-beloved “close-out retailers” holding a surfeit of new clothes that no one was really buying.<br />An intriguing new solution for selling overstock, off-season clothing has emerged, however. Two upstart companies—Heat, founded in London in November 2019; and Scarce, launched in New York in December 2020—offer so-called “luxury mystery boxes” that contain clothing items pulled from the surplus stock of boutiques, brands like Moncler, Balenciaga and Off-White, and even factories. Collectively, the items originally retailed for two to three times as much, on average, as the box’s price. The twist: Until the customers open the box and peek inside, they have no idea what they’re getting. That said, boxes are sold by gender, and users can input in advance their pant, shoe and top sizes<br />Joe Wilkinson, one of the co-founders of Heat, explained that he and his partners came across this surprise packaging concept via YouTube. They noticed “a bit of a trend” for videos where YouTubers would film themselves opening “mystery boxes” that they’d acquired either from independent fashion resellers or other YouTubers. In a typical clip, a chatty, college-aged streetwear fan would tear open a box to reveal some rare Adidas, a piece of Yeezy or Supreme merch, or a hard-to-find Palm Angels hoodie. The videos were like an action flick for sneaker addicts and the “what will they pull out next?” suspense kept fans watching. Mr. Wilkinson and his peers decided to turn this gamified unboxing idea into a business, catering to millennial and Gen-Z fashion fans who would watch—or make—these mystery videos.<br />The idea clicked. The day Heat launched, said Mr. Wilkinson, it sold thousands of boxes using a tiered pricing scheme. For around $400 you can acquire a box containing items like T-shirts and small accessories, while roughly $675 gets you a box filled with higher-value hoodies and outerwear. When it comes to selecting their box, which can contain two to a handful of items depending on their price, shoppers can also choose between two broad style categories: “streetwear,” which encompasses brands like Rhude and Ambush, and “contemporary,” which leans on higher-fashion brands like Casablanca and Haider Ackermann.<br />Both Heat and Scarce allow for returns, but customers must return the entire box, not just a single item. If you receive three items, and you adore just one, you will be saddled with the two other so-so items as well. Further, both companies require returns within 14 days and expect customers to assume responsibility for any return shipping fees. Perhaps because of this restrictive, cumbersome process, both companies boast low return rates: Heat claims that 10 to 15% of its boxes are returned, while Scarce reports a 5% return rate.</td>

      <td>The eyes have had it. All that extra scrolling? It’s taking a toll.</td>
      <td>This past year has been, among a great many other things, hard on the eyes. While stress and sleeplessness are contributing to our perpetually tired peepers, another behavioral shift brought on by the pandemic has had a significant impact: a steady rise in screen time. Everything from work to workouts, schooling to socializing, is now being done via video chat. And then there’s the constant doomscrolling that’s an unfortunate new norm. We’re dependent on our screens more than ever, and that’s having an effect not only on our eyes, but on the skin around them as well.<br />It’s understandable, considering the skin around the eyes is easily bothered. “The eyelid skin is the thinnest and most delicate of the body and therefore is one of the first areas to show signs of aging, including fine lines, wrinkles and hyperpigmentation,” says Shari Marchbein, a New York City dermatologist and an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at NYU. Blood vessels are often more visible through thin skin, a problem that becomes more pronounced, says Marchbein, as we age and lose collagen and elastin. The area is also hypersensitive, adds Caroline Robinson, a dermatologist and the founder and CEO of Chicago’s Tone Dermatology. “Our under-eye and eyelid skin are more susceptible to dryness and can more easily become irritated,” she says.<br />The uptick in screen time means more squinting. “Squinting, where we engage the orbicularis oculi muscle, is a top reason that dermatologists see fine lines and wrinkles at the lateral sides of the eyelid known as crow’s-feet,” says Marchbein, who often treats this issue in office with careful placement of botulinum toxin, such as Botox or Dysport, to soften and prevent future deepening of the lines. Too much squinting is also one of a number of symptoms to clue people in that they might need a new pair of glasses or an update to their prescription, says ophthalmologist Rupa Wong. “Squinting, blurry vision, abnormal head posturing, headaches, needing to move screens either closer or farther away are some of the symptoms to look for,” Wong notes.<br />While blue light is emitted primarily by the sun, we’re also exposed to it via our coterie of devices. “Known as HEV [high-energy visible] light, it’s the light in the blue end of the visible spectrum, and it penetrates even deeper into the skin than UV light does,” says Joshua Zeichner, a dermatologist and an associate professor of dermatology at New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital. While there’s solid scientific evidence of the detrimental effect of blue light produced by the sun, researchers are still investigating the impact of device-borne blue light. In general, though, the damage caused by blue light can be significant. “There is mounting evidence that supports blue light’s contribution to photoaging, including wrinkles, skin laxity and hyperpigmentation or brown spots,” says Marchbein. Dermatologists also have good evidence, she adds, to show that blue light triggers skin conditions like melasma. “As blue light penetrates the skin, reactive oxygen species are generated, which leads to DNA damage, thereby causing inflammation and the breakdown of healthy collagen and elastin,” Marchbein explains. “The more time we spend on our devices, the worse off our skin might be.”<br />So, what to do? Eye creams, depending on the active ingredients, can offer some improvement. Aesthetician Georgia Louise recommends looking for products with peptides and mild vitamin A, or retinol, to help address fine lines and wrinkles. Marchbein has found that caffeine can offer modest results for dark circles by constricting blood vessels. For redness and discoloration, she suggests the anti-inflammatory niacinamide and skin-brightening licorice root. According to Marchbein, pronounced puffiness and dark circles often require more invasive, in-office procedures like hyaluronic acid fillers and sometimes surgery. Daily application of vitamin C is important for protecting skin from HEV light–related free-radical damage, says Zeichner. One crucial product in a screen-conscious skin-care regimen, even when you’re spending most of your time indoors, is sunblock. “I recommend a daily broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher, even when indoors,” says Robinson. The key is making sure that the sunblock is a mineral variety with iron oxide on the ingredient list. “The iron-based pigments of the sunscreen help reflect away HEV light to protect the skin,” Zeichner explains. “Unfortunately, traditional chemical sunscreen does not block HEV light at all.”</td>

      <td>The New York Mets fired general manager Jared Porter on Tuesday morning just hours after publication of accusations that he sent explicit, unsolicited texts and images to a female journalist in 2016 when he worked for the Chicago Cubs.<br />The move, which comes just over a month after Porter’s hiring, was announced on Twitter by new team owner Steve Cohen and represents the first crisis of the billionaire hedge-fund manager’s stewardship of the Mets.<br />Major League Baseball also intends to launch an investigation into Porter, which could lead to him being suspended from the sport, a person familiar with the matter said. Former Houston Astros assistant GM Brandon Taubman was indefinitely banned from baseball last January after he made inappropriate comments toward female reporters at a postgame celebration during the 2019 playoffs.<br />ESPN reported that Porter, who was then working as the Cubs’ director of professional scouting, sent more than 60 unanswered messages to the woman, including one of a naked penis. The woman—who was not named and came from a foreign country to cover baseball—told ESPN she believed Porter’s initial interactions with her were of a typical journalist-source relationship, but that his tone quickly turned inappropriate.<br />In the ESPN story, which came out around 11 p.m. ET Monday night, Mets president Sandy Alderson said Porter acknowledged “his serious error in judgment” and that the organization would “review the facts.” Just before 8 a.m., Cohen tweeted that he had terminated the 41-year-old Porter, who finalized a four-year contract in mid-December.</td>

      <td>Economic rebound in year of Covid-19 was unbalanced; growth in domestic consumption lagged behind industrial and export sectors</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—One thing is missing from China’s otherwise remarkable economic recovery: a strong rebound in consumer spending.<br />Even though China was the only major economy to expand during the Covid-19 pandemic last year, its growth remains highly unbalanced, relying heavily on exports of manufactured goods to the U.S. and elsewhere. Domestic consumption has lagged, with retail sales shrinking 3.9% in 2020 from the previous year and demand for imported goods falling slightly.<br />There are many reasons for the weakness. While China’s unemployment rate never shot up as much as unemployment did in the U.S. and Europe, many employers cut salaries or hours, leaving consumers anxious. Many opted to save more—a common tendency in China, which has long had a high savings rate.<br />China’s government also didn’t hand out checks to consumers as the U.S. did, choosing instead to focus stimulus on helping factories and other businesses.<br />Many economists now believe spending weakness will persist in 2021. If it does, it could mean Chinese demand does less than hoped to help lift other economies out of trouble this year.</td>

A nationwide referendum in 2009 also saw Swiss voters support a proposal to ban the construction of minarets for mosques.<br />This time voters are being asked whether Switzerland should ban full-face coverings nationwide after a group including members of the right-wing Swiss People’s Party gathered more than 100,000 signatures, passing the threshold required for a popular vote on changing the constitution. The same group initiated the 2009 vote, describing minarets as foreign to Swiss cultural traditions, sparking a wider debate in Europe about the integration of Muslims at a time when there was growing concern over the influence of Islamist extremists.<br />The debate continues in many parts of Europe, notably France, where President Emmanuel Macron has proposed legislation to outlaw what he calls “Islamist separatism,” and which includes preventing the indoctrination of children during home schooling and online hate speech.<br />France previously prohibited wearing full-face veils in public as a way to support its secular values, as have other European countries.</td>

Under the transaction, expected to close in the first quarter, Sycamore will acquire Azamara’s three ships and intellectual property such as the brand’s logo and slogan, the company added.<br />Royal Caribbean in December said it sold two ships in its Royal Caribbean International fleet. The company will come out of the deal with three fewer ships than its 61-ship fleet in 2019 after taking two ship deliveries and exiting a joint venture for Pullmantur Cruceros, which filed for reorganization under Spanish insolvency laws in 2020, a spokesman said.<br />“It allows us to really prioritize our resources, which are not just financial resources—it’s also the minds and time of management,” Mr. Liberty told The Wall Street Journal.</td>

      <td>Potential land mines await those seeking to raze and redevelop a space that spans dozens of football fields</td>
      <td>Many developers look at failing malls and envision modern office campuses, bustling warehouses or residential buildings. But some are finding that converting these shopping centers isn’t so easy.<br />Repurposing a mall is expensive. New owners typically need to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars on construction and labor, developers and brokers say.<br />Razing and redeveloping a space that spans dozens of football fields is filled with potential land mines. The new investor may own the mall but not the department stores or parcels in the parking lot, which means an owner needs their approval. Owners will also need to seek rezoning and entitlements permits that can take years, during which economic conditions can deteriorate.<br />Consequently, many recent conversion efforts have gone awry, forcing the owner to sell the property at a discount. In other cases, local government authorities have lost patience and bought the owners out.<br />Brookfield Property Partners  LP has made converting all or part of malls one of its prime real-estate strategies. In 2018, the firm bought the two-thirds of mall operator GGP Inc. it didn’t already own, valuing GGP’s property portfolio at around $15 billion. The acquisition reflected Brookfield’s confidence in the mall-conversion strategy, but the real-estate investor has often struggled to make this approach work.</td>

Lloyd Austin appears before the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday, he will be one of the few members of President-elect Joe Biden’s team with deep military experience to help him confront threats around the world, his advisers said.<br />At the same time, the Army officer with 41 years of military service will have to persuade those same lawmakers he can lead the Pentagon with the perspective of a civilian.<br />The modern Defense Department was designed to have a civilian leader and a team of senior uniformed officers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advising the president. Because of that, the law requires Gen. Austin, who retired from the U.S. Army in 2016, to receive a waiver from Congress to hold the job of secretary of defense, in addition to winning the Senate confirmation required of most cabinet-level appointees.<br />“Lloyd is very cognizant that he is coming in as a political appointee,” said a person familiar with his preparations for the confirmation hearings. “He knows that he is going to be a civilian, politically appointed official in the Biden cabinet, and he’s comfortable taking on that new role. He has to make it clear he is not a general.”<br />Laws safeguarding civilian control of the military require the top Pentagon civilian job to be held by someone out of uniform for seven years, unless Congress votes to waive the rule. Gen. Austin, 67, would become the second recent Pentagon leader to require a congressional waiver, following retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, who was President Trump’s first defense secretary.</td>

Changes in equity value result both from firm investment decisions and changes in market valuations.<br />Hotels account for 7% of the equity value, down from 23% in 2015.

      <td>Chinese robotics companies took market share last year amid the disruptions of the pandemic</td>
      <td>Covid-19 has accelerated automation in factories, especially in manufacturing powerhouse China. Foreign companies have long dominated the market for industrial robots and automation tools there—but there are signs that dominance is fraying around the edges.<br />As the factory for the world, China is unsurprisingly far and away the largest market for industrial robots. Before the pandemic, however, the U.S.-China trade war was slowing growth. New installations of industrial robots amounted to 140,500 in 2019, a 9% decline from the previous year, but still almost three times the number for second-place Japan, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Last year was likely much better:  Credit Suisse  estimates that China’s industrial-robotics market grew 9.5% in 2020.<br />Covid-19 initially shut down factories in China, but as the country gradually got the pandemic under control, demand for automation equipment bounced back. Surging sales for consumer electronics and electric vehicles have also driven demand for automation products.<br />Foreign companies like Japan’s  Fanuc  and Europe’s  ABB  control nearly three-quarters of China’s industrial-robot market, according to Citi. But hopes are running high in China that the government will push more strongly for local content in the robotics and automation supply chain. Stocks of Chinese automation companies have rallied. Shares in  Shenzhen Inovance Technology ,  for example, have tripled since the beginning of 2020. Industrial robot maker  Estun Automation ’s  shares have also rallied.<br />Some Chinese automation-equipment companies won market share last year as Covid-19 disrupted supply chains for foreign rivals. Citi estimates Inovance’s China market share in servo motors, which are used to control precise movements, has jumped to more than 16% in 2020, against 11% in 2019 and 3% in 2013. The company also recorded strong growth in its electric-vehicle motor business, which shares some similarities with servo motors. The company’s net profit nearly doubled year-over-year in the first nine months of 2020.</td>

      <td>TORONTO—Canadian and U.S. officials are at odds over the fate of a pipeline underneath the Great Lakes, exacerbating disagreements over energy policy between the two nations as the Biden administration prepares to take office.<br />Citing environmental concerns, Michigan state officials have told  Enbridge Inc.  to close its Line 5 pipeline, which carries more than half a million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids each day from Superior, Wis. to Sarnia, Ontario. Canadian officials say closing the pipeline would choke off more than half of the supply used to make gasoline, jet fuel and home-heating oil for the most populous parts of the country. The 645-mile pipeline, which is part of Enbridge’s mainline system that conveys oil and natural gas liquids from Alberta, feeds refineries in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ontario and Quebec.<br />“Pipelines are so vital to the economy and the recovery,” said Chris Bloomer president of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, a trade group. “We’re hoping for some pragmatism.”<br />The dispute adds another point of conflict in the energy relationship between the U.S. and Canada. Officials, companies and environmentalists in both countries have clashed in recent years over how to balance energy security with environmental concerns.<br />President-elect Joe Bien’s team has said that he opposes a proposed extension of  TC Energy Corp.’s  Keystone pipeline, which would carry oil from Alberta to Nebraska. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has long advocated for the extension, has said it would be a key issue between the two countries during Mr. Biden’s tenure. Canadian officials said they expect Mr. Biden to stick with his plans to scrap the project.</td>

Staples said it would pursue a public tender offer for ODP’s shares in March if the companies don’t reach agreement on a deal.<br />ODP has concluded that a sale of its retail and consumer-facing e-commerce operations to Staples or a joint venture is preferable to a full takeover, according to a letter sent by ODP’s chairman to an official of the private-equity firm that controls Staples. It said in the letter, seen by The Wall Street Journal, that such a deal would afford the same cost savings as a full-company sale but be less likely to attract prolonged regulatory scrutiny.<br />Staples’ recent bid marks the third time it has tried to acquire its main bricks-and-mortar rival. Previous efforts, including a $6.3 billion proposal five years ago, were blocked by antitrust enforcers. Staples was taken private by Sycamore Partners in 2017 and is now controlled by a subsidiary of the buyout firm called USR Parent Inc.<br />In a sign that investors anticipate a deal of some sort, ODP shares have climbed 24% since USR disclosed its bid, closing at $45.86 Friday. A tie-up of the office-suppliers’ retail operations could generate significant cost-savings if the combined company reduces its footprint by closing overlapping stores.</td>

      <td>Best explanation for how stocks have moved so far this year is the raw price of the stock, an almost meaningless number</td>
      <td>Sometimes it’s hard to argue that market capitalism has any chance of correctly allocating money to the companies that can use it best. Case in point: Stock-market performance this year has been driven by the raw share price, with lower-priced stocks doing better and higher-priced worse.<br />Forget a careful evaluation of future cash flow, valuation, brand power, management skill or even political sensitivity. I repeat: The best explanation for how stocks have moved so far this year is the price of the stock, an almost meaningless number.<br />Stocks priced below $1 have performed the best, followed by those between $1 and $2, and so on up almost perfectly. The worst performers have share prices above $100. It looks remarkably like investors are treating a low-price share as an indicator that the stock is a bargain, and a higher price as a sign that it is worse value for money.<br />The share price on its own carries virtually no useful information: It depends entirely on how many shares the company has issued. A company can split a high priced stock to create more at a lower price, without making any difference to the intrinsic worth of the company. Equally, it can consolidate its shares to reduce the number, increasing the share price but again without any effect on how much the company should be worth.<br />The fact that the stock price at the start of the year is a near-perfect determinant of how a stock has performed is depressing, but at least in part explainable.</td>

      <td>Just when you thought e-commerce couldn’t get any hotter,  Poshmark  wants to be the life of the party.<br />The online platform, which calls itself a social shopping marketplace, saw its shares more than double in their public debut on Thursday. After a tumble Friday, Poshmark’s market value is still over $5 billion, more than a fifth of that of pandemic darling  Etsy ,  despite posting less than 12% of that company’s profit in the third quarter of last year.<br />Etsy’s shares have more than quadrupled over the past year, benefiting not only from stellar sales growth as an online marketplace but also from a pandemic-driven boom in mask sales.<br />Assuming the e-commerce frenzy in the market keeps up, Poshmark could do it one better. At its core, the platform similarly enables individuals and small businesses to market and sell goods online. But it also adds a social network aspect, incorporating likes, comments, shares and other connections through “Posh parties.” Even better, it is generally known for being a secondhand marketplace, playing into perhaps today’s hottest trend in fashion—sustainability.

While it does offer personalized curation, it doesn’t hold inventory like thredUp,  RealReal  or Stitch Fix do. An asset-light model means it can quickly pivot, for example from promoting workwear to athleisure, based on changing retail trends. And its sellers don’t have to be as skilled as Etsy’s. Only so many people can handcraft jewelry or home décor; almost everyone has a piece or two of halfway decent clothing forgotten in their closet.</td>

To be sure, wealth management firms should conduct full due diligence on any acquisition suitor who comes calling.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden’s choice for Treasury secretary, will urge lawmakers in her confirmation hearing Tuesday to “act big” to avert a protracted economic downturn and put aside concerns about the mounting national debt.<br />“Economists don’t always agree, but I think there is a consensus now: Without further action, we risk a longer, more painful recession now—and long-term scarring of the economy later,” Ms. Yellen says in the text of remarks to the Senate Finance Committee as reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, unveiled last week, provides for another round of direct stimulus payments, extended and enhanced jobless benefits, funding for schools and first responders and the creation of a nationwide vaccination program. The proposal also includes longstanding Democratic priorities, such as raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding paid leave for workers.<br />Republicans have decried the size and scope of the measure, arguing it would spend more than the economy needs. Some Republicans and Democrats have also expressed concern about the growing national debt, which at $21.6 trillion exceeds the annual output of the U.S. economy.<br />Ms. Yellen aims to address those concerns in her testimony: “Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big.”</td>

Many of those peddling the new poultry items are better known as hamburger chains, including  McDonald’s Corp. ,  Shake Shack Inc.  and  Jack in the Box Inc.<br />Restaurant operators, grappling with slowdowns and restrictions brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, aim to capture consumers’ enthusiasm for crispy, breaded-chicken sandwiches. That fervor helped build Chick-fil-A Inc. into one of the nation’s top fast-food chains over the past decade, and made Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc.’s offering a social-media sensation after its 2019 debut.<br />The chicken-sandwich war, as industry competitors describe it, means diners have lots of options—such as a Korean-style iteration at Shake Shack, a McDonald’s version topped with spicy pepper sauce and a new KFC offering that the chain bills as its “best chicken sandwich ever.” The sandwich craze also might bring lasting changes to the restaurant business, with owners spending thousands of dollars on new equipment for battering chicken filets to compete for what some franchisees say is the future of eating out.<br />Shake Shack began selling its new fried-chicken sandwich in the burger chain’s South Korean restaurants during the fall, before it made its debut in the U.S. this month. One of the first limited-time items it put on menus during the pandemic was a spicy chicken sandwich, also during the fall.</td>

      <td>Hopes for an economic rebound and a slowdown in borrowing have powered U.S. corporate bonds to a strong start in 2021.<br />As of Thursday, the average extra yield, or spread, investors demanded to hold investment-grade corporate bonds over U.S. Treasurys was 0.93 percentage points, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. That was down from 1.05 percentage points one month ago and the narrowest gap since January 2020.<br />The move reflects investors’ growing confidence that highly rated U.S. companies will endure the pandemic, boosted by vaccine rollouts, economic stimulus and easy money from the Federal Reserve. Spreads had widened sharply during 2020’s early year market turmoil, when many investors feared the pandemic would spark a wave of defaults and bankruptcies, fueling losses in corporate debt.<br />The Fed’s intervention, which included cutting interest rates and buying billions of dollars worth of bonds, helped fuel a recovery. With rates near zero, investors chased extra yield in the investment-grade market, helping companies refinance their debt at lower interest rates and raise record amounts of cash to protect balance sheets from the pandemic’s blows.<br />Now Wall Street economists are projecting a pickup in economic growth later in 2021 as vaccination efforts accelerate. Investment-grade mutual and exchange-traded funds have taken in more than $12 billion this year as of Jan. 13, according to Refinitiv Lipper, after posting the largest one-year inflow ever in 2020.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The global coronavirus pandemic has intensified the rivalry between the U.S. and China, increasing future instability in international diplomatic relations, according to an annual report on global risks from the World Economic Forum.<br />The report, which draws on opinions of hundreds of executives and academics associated with the WEF, as well as risk-management specialists, says the pandemic threatens to widen income and other disparities within and between societies, increasing the risks of a further fracturing inside some states and in international relations.<br />Covid-19 “has entrenched state power and intensified rivalry between the United States and China,” the report says, forcing other powers to choose sides.<br />“With some alliances weakening, diplomatic relationships will become more unstable at points where superpower tectonic plates meet or withdraw,” it says. This trend has been accentuated as a lack of face-to-face discussions have hurt traditional diplomacy.<br />The report is usually published just ahead of the WEF’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. This year, the meeting has been postponed because of the pandemic until May, when it will take place in Singapore. Next week, the forum is organizing a virtual meeting that includes addresses from leaders such as China’s Xi Jinping and India’s Narendra Modi.</td>

      <td>Recent ructions in U.S. government bond markets have revived discussions of a potential “taper tantrum,” mirroring the expectations of a sudden rise in interest rates that came in 2013 as the Federal Reserve signaled its intention to cut back its enormous bond-buying program.<br />At the time, the news took investors by surprise and rocked emerging markets. There is less prospect of that this time: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says he wants the Fed to signal any tapering well in advance.<br />But just as important, developing markets look better insulated than in 2013.<br />It wasn’t just the taper tantrum itself that mattered for emerging markets but the currency-market shifts during the subsequent year. The ICE Dollar Index rose by as much as 25% from the spring of 2014 to the spring of 2015. That surge disrupted years of planning by corporations and governments, which had anticipated a relatively weak dollar, something that seemed like the new normal for almost a decade.<br />That wouldn’t be the case today. For one, the dollar’s decline in 2020 was far smaller than its mid-2000s plunge. A similar climb would take the dollar into rarefied territory seen only between 2000 and 2002. That isn’t impossible but doesn’t seem likely.</td>

Mr. Bachelier also donated another $272,000 to other right-wing causes—again using bitcoin—giving more than $17,000 to the social-media platform Gab, and a similar amount to the anti-immigration website VDARE.com, according to the report.<br />Weeks later, Mr. Fuentes and some of his supporters were part of the crowd at President Trump’s rally before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to researchers who have been studying the event and its participants.<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation is exploring potential foreign sources of funding for far-right groups in the wake of the Capitol riots, and the agency has been briefed on Mr. Bachelier’s donations, according to people familiar with the matter.</td>

He said he would have left earlier, but a transition official for President-elect Joe Biden invited him to continue serving as bureau director, and “under other circumstances” he would have been honored to stay in his post under the new president.<br />Mr. Dillingham’s resignation comes after the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General issued a memo that raised concerns about his directive for career officials to produce a report that “includes data on documented and undocumented persons in the United States.” Career officials said they were “under significant pressure to produce this technical report,” the OIG memo said.<br />The memo inquired how Mr. Dillingham would ensure the data quality of the report and why the Census Bureau director prioritized the report.<br />Mr. Dillingham addressed the inspector general’s memo at length in his resignation announcement. Mr. Dillingham defended the data request and said it “was not an attempt to release 2020 census data results for apportionment early.”</td>

      <td>As the Trump Presidency ends in the disgrace of the Capitol riot, an effort is already underway to erase everything in the last four years as disgraceful too. That’s a lie—a Big Lie, to borrow the cliché of the moment. Donald Trump’s profound character flaws need to be separated from what so many people in his Administration accomplished for the country.<br />These men and women didn’t “enable” Donald Trump. Sixty-three million Americans did that when they elected him in 2016, with a significant assist from the Democrats who nominated Hillary Clinton, perhaps the only candidate who could have lost to Mr. Trump.<br />Mr. Trump appointed people who had the usual varying combinations of conviction and ambition. They served despite the hostility of the bureaucracy and press, and a President who often didn’t appreciate their work. Sometimes—in some cases, often—they protected the country by stopping Mr. Trump from his worst impulses.<br />We can’t list everyone who contributed, but before the Biden Presidency begins we thought we’d link some of those who did their jobs well with the successful policies they promoted. We’ve already saluted Betsy DeVos at Education and Ajit Pai at the Federal Communications Commission. Here’s a sample of other significant people and policies:<br />• Larry Kudlow, Kevin Hassett, Casey Mulligan, Gary Cohn, and others on the economic team. The pandemic-lockdown recession has obscured that the pre-Covid U.S. economy was the strongest since the 1990s. Unlike the Obama years, the benefits of growth were widely dispersed, wage gains were strongest for the least skilled, and poverty saw its sharpest decline in decades.</td>

I know you will do well and we will be proud of you. All I ask is that you remember where you came from.’ ”<br />He was right: His daughter would make him proud. Two days before she graduated from Harvard in 2006, she received a job offer from the George W. Bush White House (where I was a colleague). Afterward she helped on various Republican campaigns before returning home for a stint with the family business.<br />Then, in 2014, she ran for Congress—and won—in New York’s 21st, a mostly rural, upstate district between Albany and Canada.

      <td>But formidable global challenges await Joe Biden as he moves into the White House.</td>
      <td>Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Ali Khamenei, Nicolás Maduro and Kim Jong Un doubtless were gleefully munching their popcorn as the violent fringe of a large pro-Trump demonstration stormed the halls of Congress earlier this month. The rioting in Washington and the militarization of the capital for this week’s inauguration telegraph American instability and weakness—something that cheered every U.S. adversary and alarmed every friend around the world.<br />That said, the national and global doom-mongering is overdone. President Trump’s false claims and incendiary rhetoric ignited an ugly incident, not a constitutional crisis. Mr. Trump is too weak and American democracy too strong for any other result. Fundamental U.S. constitutional structures were never in peril. Up and down the line, state election officials from both parties followed the appropriate procedures, at times in the face of bullying and threats.<br />Distinguished lawyers of impeccable Republican and conservative credentials declined to lend their reputations to the weak claims that the president’s campaign sought to litigate. And when those cases came up for judicial scrutiny, courts filled with Trump appointees decided them according to the law. Even those representatives and senators who failed in their duty by echoing the president’s unfounded, inflammatory claims did so secure in the knowledge that their cynical grandstanding wouldn’t overturn the legal process. The American military’s commitment to constitutional order never wavered.<br />The weary capital could still see more violence on Inauguration Day, but the republic stands. The momentary frenzy of a mob or the histrionic demagoguery of a defeated president and his most opportunistic allies notwithstanding, there has not been a moment when there was a real possibility that Mr. Trump’s term of office would extend past its constitutionally mandated close.<br />Counterintuitively, the real message of the 2020 election is that the U.S. remains strong. Voters elected, electors voted, and the transfer of power proceeds apace. A perfect storm—a destructive pandemic, an economic maelstrom, a crisis in race relations, a bitter election campaign and, in the end, the effort of a defeated president to foment all the trouble he could—still couldn’t prevent the constitutional process from taking its course.</td>

      <td>Since 2003, two activist judges on the Third Circuit have been arbitrarily stalling FCC innovation.</td>
      <td>Two judges on the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals have spent the past 17 years blocking a congressionally mandated modernization of antiquated broadcast-television regulations. The Supreme Court will hear an appeal Tuesday, FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, giving broadcasters the chance to be unshackled from restrictions this activist court continues to impose on them—which are contrary to court precedent and statute and make no sense in light of the competition from digital media.<br />At stake are Federal Communications Commission rules that would allow broadcasters to compete more efficiently against less-regulated tech companies, invest more in local news gathering, and strengthen their position as a crucial conduit for free speech.<br />Decades ago, over-the-air broadcast television was the dominant medium on which Americans relied for news, weather and entertainment. To curb broadcasters’ clout, in the mid-20th century the FCC heavily regulated the industry and limited how many TV stations a single owner could have. Congress saw competition coming from cable and the internet and enacted a deregulatory law known as Section 202(h) of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. It mandates that the FCC “shall” repeal or modify any broadcast-ownership rule it determines is no longer “necessary in the public interest as the result of competition.” The Third Circuit’s legal misinterpretation of this statute and the FCC’s obligation to act in the “public interest” are at the heart of the appeal.<br />Over the decades, the FCC, not Congress, created a broad definition of the “public interest” when it came to broadcast ownership rules. Among many factors, the agency has included five different types of “diversity” in its analysis: viewpoint, outlet, program, source and minority and female ownership. But in 1996 Congress singled out “competition,” not diversity, as the primary factor for the FCC to consider in its public-interest analysis.<br />Lawmakers intended Section 202(h) to give broadcasters the freedom to create defensive combinations and economies of scale, thereby liberating capital to invest in societally beneficial programming such as local news and severe-weather warnings. Today broadcasters face declining viewership and slumping ad dollars as viewers turn to alternatives on the internet. Local over-the-air TV ad revenue has plummeted more than 40% since 2000, adjusted for inflation, and the pandemic has made matters worse. Meanwhile, online ad purchases have skyrocketed. Google’s share of local ad revenue in 2019 alone, about $17 billion, was equal to all the local ad income of every TV station across the country combined.</td>

      <td>Daniel Ek wanted to bring Napster’s idea of a musical smorgasbord into the world of legal streaming. Would record labels play along?</td>
      <td>Neil Young, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham owe Daniel Ek an enormous debt of gratitude right about now. The rock legends have all recently sold their song publishing rights for gigantic sums, sell-offs that can partially be attributed to the surge in digital revenue that accounts for more than half the global recorded-music market. One man saw all this coming before anyone else: Mr. Ek, the 37-year-old co-founder of Spotify, the world’s largest streaming service with 320 million users and counting.<br />For those of us who regularly call up almost any song we desire with a tap on our phone screens, it’s easy to think of streaming music as an inevitable development. But for Mr. Ek, streaming’s triumph was more of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Having endured years of pushback, Spotify has been at the vanguard of a global revolution in the way music is consumed. It’s quite a turnabout for the Stockholm native, who has endured heaps of negative press, the enmity of underpaid musicians everywhere, and the looming threat of competing services from Apple, Jay-Z’s Tidal and many others.<br />Co-written by two veteran reporters who have closely tracked the Swedish technology sector, “The Spotify Play” (translated into English by the authors themselves) delivers an outsider-to-kingmaker narrative that should be read by every gun-shy entrepreneur too spooked by Silicon Valley’s giants to go head-to-head with them. Mr. Ek has outlasted his competitors and defied his critics: His triumphs are soundtracked by 1.5 billion user-generated Spotify playlists.<br />A rabid music fan as a teenager, Mr. Ek’s exposure to Napster was a profound conversion experience. Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker’s file-sharing service was the shrapnel blast that tore holes through the web’s commercial firewalls. “Napster is probably the internet service which has changed my life more than anything else,” Mr. Ek once told an interviewer. What if he could merge Napster’s peer-to-peer technology with commercial content? What if he could draw file-sharing out of the shadows?<br />Even while Mr. Ek was rapidly moving up as a programmer in Stockholm’s hot tech market, the notion of a legal answer to Napster’s music streaming never left him. In 2006 Mr. Ek’s tiny startup Advertigo was acquired by Tradedoubler, a digital marketing company whose co-founder Martin Lorentzon was enamored of Mr. Ek and his ideas. The savvy, flamboyant Mr. Lorentzon would become both partner and cheerleader. When he came to visit Mr. Ek in his raffish Stockholm neighborhood, Mr. Ek quoted “The Godfather” at him: “Put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun.”</td>

      <td>Quant pioneer Renaissance Technologies LLC sent clients an analysis of its performance and a rationalization of recent deep losses, an unusual move for one of Wall Street’s most secretive firms.<br />In the letter sent late Friday, the firm said losses of between 20% and 30% in 2020 for its three funds open to outside investors should have been expected at some point during the course of the funds’ histories. The letter partly blamed heightened volatility for the weak performance.<br />Still, some clients said the letter was short on meaningful explanations.<br />The decision to reach out to investors with a letter follows an awful year for several of Renaissance’s hedge funds, with some clients having expressed unhappiness in recent days. The weak performance of some of the firm’s outside funds has spurred investor withdrawals. Renaissance manages nearly $60 billion firmwide, down from about $75 billion a year ago.<br />“Although recent performance has been terrible and worse than prior performance would have suggested was likely for 2020,” the letter says, “in track records as long as ours, some risk-return ratios every bit as bad as the ones we are now seeing are not shocking.”</td>

      <td>Biden’s pick to lead Treasury says Congress must ‘act big’ to boost economic recovery, fend off ‘long-term scarring’</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden’s choice for Treasury secretary, plans to tell lawmakers that the U.S. risks a longer, more painful recession unless Congress approves more aid and urge them to “act big” to shore up the recovery.<br />Ms. Yellen is set to testify Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee, which is considering her nomination, according to a copy of her prepared remarks that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />“Economists don’t always agree, but I think there is a consensus now: Without further action, we risk a longer, more painful recession now—and long-term scarring of the economy later,” Ms. Yellen will say. “Over the next few months, we are going to need more aid to distribute the vaccine; to reopen schools; to help states keep firefighters and teachers on the job.”<br />Mr. Biden’s nomination of Ms. Yellen positions the 74-year-old labor economist to lead his administration’s efforts to advance the recovery from the destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic and related shutdowns. She will also play a key role in pushing the administration’s economic agenda on Capitol Hill, a job that will start in earnest Tuesday, said Tony Fratto, a senior Treasury and White House aide in the George W. Bush administration.<br />Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, unveiled last week, provides for another round of direct stimulus payments, extended and enhanced jobless benefits, funding for schools and first responders and the creation of a nationwide vaccination program. It also includes longstanding Democratic priorities, such as raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding paid leave for workers.</td>

Total plans to spend $3 billion a year on renewables by 2030, around 20% of its annual investment budget and up from $2 billion last year.<br />The Adani deal gives Total exposure to a leading renewables business in India, one of the world’s fastest-growing markets for energy demand. Adani has 54 wind and solar projects in operation across the country, including one of the world’s largest solar projects in Kamuthi, Southern India. Based on existing generating capacity and the projects in its pipeline, Adani is the world’s largest developer of solar power, Total said.<br />As part of the deal, Total is also taking a 50% stake in a portfolio of Adani’s solar assets and getting a seat on the company’s board. The move will help Total toward its goal of having 35 gigawatts of renewable power capacity by 2025, up from around 7 gigawatts last year.</td>

      <td>Phil Gramm and Mike Solon argue that “The Era of Nonstop Stimulus” (op-ed, Jan. 4) that began in response to the pandemic threatens to become an Obamanomics stimulus sequel on steroids. The Obama economy struggled to exceed 2% a year growth for eight years, as federal debt piled up. The Biden administration now plans to spend trillions of dollars more than the $3.3 trillion of stimulus since the pandemic began.<br />The authors contend that stimulus spending is all about political not economic, outcomes. Mr. Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders’s “unity” document is a playbook for social justice and inclusive economics. Both are about righting America’s past wrongs and creating more dependents on the state. The metrics the authors use for economic success—e.g., 3% annual growth is better than 2%—aren’t the metrics used in inclusive economics. Which groups get the benefits of growth is more important to Democrats than the absolute level of growth. If income inequality is less with 2% growth because of stimulus spending, confiscatory taxes, income redistribution and suboptimal investments by Washington, that is an acceptable tradeoff. If an era of nonstop stimulus ends with economic malaise or collapse, the outcome may be palatable as long as inequality is less when everyone (other than the political class and its cronies) is worse off.<br />Democrats have the media covering their backs when it comes to assigning blame for an economic mess. The left’s control of messaging grew stronger as a result of the mob invasion of the Capitol, with tech giants using it as an excuse to purge social-media voices that disturb progressives.<br />Philip Grant<br />Palm Coast, Fla.</td>

China being China, there’s much more—and less—to the story.<br />The top-line data make China a rare good news story in the pandemic year. Inflation-adjusted GDP growth hit 6.5% in the last three months of the year, making it 2.3% for 2020. This contrasts with the rest of the world, where social distancing and lockdowns have triggered some of the worst contractions on record and raise the specter of long and difficult recoveries.<br />Some of Beijing’s cheerleaders want you to believe this is mainly because the Chinese government acted so aggressively to suppress the pandemic. That story sits uneasily alongside Beijing’s slow-rolling of early information about Covid-19 when more information sharing might have helped other countries.<br />Beijing adopted particularly aggressive lockdowns once it did act, sealing off entire cities and even now locking down apartment buildings or neighborhoods at a moment’s notice to suppress outbreaks. To the extent anyone can trust Beijing’s data about virus spread, it appears to have Covid mostly under control.<br />But a closer look at the economy suggests the growth has come from somewhere other than Beijing’s putative suppression of the pandemic. China’s Communist Party reverted to its old economic-crisis playbook to goose debt and exports while tightening political dominance over the economy.</td>

His close association with Mr. Biden has drawn comparisons to James A. Baker III, the longtime friend and political adviser to President George H.W. Bush before becoming his secretary of state, though Mr. Baker came to the post with experience as Treasury Secretary and White House chief of staff during the Reagan administration.<br />For Mr. Blinken, however, a high-profile cabinet position will be a new role. He has spent much of his career in the shadow of his powerful mentor and will now be called on to demonstrate his skills as a foreign-policy strategist and the nation’s chief diplomat.<br />In his Tuesday hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Blinken plans to sketch out a vision in which the U.S. has a central role in wrestling with global problems, uses alliances and international institutions to try to expand its leverage and pursues policies that it can argue benefit the American middle class.<br />That approach is intended to supplant President Trump’s “America First” doctrine as an organizing principle for foreign policy while also seeking to draw popular support for the Biden agenda from voters who might otherwise be sympathetic to Mr. Trump’s approach.</td>

It was the first time he had tried to return to Russia since a near-fatal poison attack last August that left him in a coma and undergoing treatment in Germany.<br />He was remanded in custody until Feb. 15, and now faces a court decision that could turn a suspended sentence he received for an embezzlement case in 2014 into a real prison term. Authorities say he violated the terms of his parole while he was abroad recovering from August’s attack.<br />The European Court of Human Rights said in 2018 that the original case was politically motivated and those charges are trumped up. In addition, Russian prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into him for allegedly siphoning donations to his Anti-Corruption Foundation.<br />Mr. Navalny says both legal moves were politically motivated and meant to scare him away from returning to Russia. In short videos from the courtroom distributed among supporters, Mr. Navalny, 44 years old, said his detention showed that Mr. Putin fears his opposition movement, which will seek to make gains in a parliamentary election in September.

      <td>Startup deploys tiny satellites into orbit in successful demonstration flight</td>
      <td>A venture to launch small satellites using a rocket fired from a converted jumbo jet deployed 10 tiny ones into orbit for the first time Sunday, providing a big boost for the startup founded by entrepreneur Richard Branson.<br />The successful demonstration flight by Southern-California-based Virgin Orbit, nearly eight months after a botched test, lifts the company into the select group of small-satellite launch providers able to offer flight-proven hardware.<br />With the proliferation of small-satellite manufacturers across the U.S. and other regions, specialized launch providers are rushing to fill the demand to blast their products into space. They include Rocket Lab, a U.S.-New Zealand company that has a flight-proven rocket; Texas-based Firefly Aerospace; and Relativity Space, which plans to launch 3-D manufactured rockets. But only a few of the startups can claim the distinction of blasting out of the atmosphere, a goal Mr. Branson and his team have pursued for years, even as more-conventional rocket designs grabbed most of the public attention.<br />Virgin Orbit’s novel airborne platform, a specially outfitted  Boeing Co.  747 jet named Cosmic Girl, climbed to an altitude of roughly 6 miles above the Pacific Ocean and released a slender, 70-foot rocket slung under its left wing. The booster’s main liquid-fueled engine roared to life, transporting the cluster of cubesats, or miniature satellites, built by universities and sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, into low-Earth orbit.<br />Mr. Branson said the company’s LauncherOne rocket would encourage “a whole new generation of innovators on the path to orbit.” Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said the company managed to demonstrate every element of its launch system. The next mission is slated to begin commercial operations, with customers including the U.K.’s Air Force and low-cost communications provider Swarm Technologies Inc.</td>

      <td>Take a quiz to guess the emotions behind the masks</td>
      <td><br />In a world of masks, it’s harder than ever to read the faces around us. Only now are scientists learning how we manage without the revealing tells of smiles, sneers, dimples and frowns that signal our state of mind, as masks in public settings become common in more than 50 countries.<br />While a public health necessity, masks challenge our skill in understanding facial expressions, confusing our ability to distinguish disgust from anger or happiness from indifference, several new studies say. Scientists worry about the implications for infants and children who may lag in learning to recognize subtle facial signals of anger, fear, doubt, delight and sorrow. While data is sparse, one new study suggests that children have as much trouble reading facial expressions when people are wearing masks as when they are wearing sunglasses.<br />In that test, the children correctly identified the emotional expression on uncovered faces about 66% of the time, well above the odds of just guessing, psychologist Ashley Ruba at the University of Wisconsin-Madison said. Looking at faces in surgical-type masks, however, the children were only able to correctly identify sadness about 28% of the time, anger 27% of the time, and fear 18% of the time.<br />“For very young children, I think it is still an open question as to how they’ll navigate these situations,” said Dr. Ruba, who studies how children learn to understand other people’s emotions. “Infants can use all these other cues, like tone of voice.”</td>

      <td>The kingdom imposed a moratorium on capital punishment for drug-related offenses</td>
      <td>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia—Saudi Arabia said Monday it had imposed a moratorium on capital punishment for drug-related offenses that led to an 85% reduction in executions, as the conservative Muslim kingdom seeks to soften its image to attract Western tourists and foreign investment.<br />The state-backed Human Rights Commission said 27 executions were recorded in 2020. That is down from 184 the year before, according to rights watchdog Amnesty International, when Saudi Arabia trailed only China and Iran globally.<br />The commission declined to provide additional details about the change that had gone into effect last year.<br />The interior ministry didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Official Saudi announcements show no drug-related executions since January 2020, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.<br />The move comes as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeals to Western tourists and foreign investors put off by Saudi Arabia’s reputation as a bastion of ultraconservative social norms enforced by religious police. Beheadings and crucifixions were once commonplace in public squares, including in the center of Riyadh, the capital.</td>

      <td>The coronavirus pandemic has shredded the international competition calendar, and the mess will run all the way to the 2022 Olympics</td>
      <td>The United States has crowned its 2021 national figure skating champions this weekend. What happens next is anyone’s guess.<br />Normally, the U.S. and every other figure skating power would send its winners on to the world championships, and that would determine how many skaters each country can send to the Winter Olympics next year.<br />For Nathan Chen, who is now a five-time U.S. men’s champion, the world event would also be a chance to cement his case for the Olympic title that eluded him in 2018. For the ice dance champions, Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, it would help stake their claim for a 2022 Olympic medal, after several years of trading places with other couples for the top position in the U.S.<br />For the U.S. ladies, including champion Bradie Tennell, strong showings would allow them to field three Olympic entries and increase the chances that at least one female skater might be able to break through and return an American to the podium for the first time since 2006. And for the beleaguered U.S. pairs, securing even two Olympic entries would allow them to halt the American slide in that discipline.<br />But the coronavirus pandemic has the 2021 world championships in Stockholm teetering, after the virus already forced the cancellation of the 2020 world championships set for Montreal last March. The victorious U.S. skaters are keenly aware that the tickets they’ve just punched may be tickets to nowhere.</td>

They have seen it all: wars, recessions, control by one party and then another, terrorist attacks, and, now, a pandemic.<br />They are, in short, the very personification of the political establishment that was attacked by American citizens who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. Now they are, collectively, in charge of handling the aftermath.<br />Together, they all face the same question: Are they really in control?<br />They are, respectively, President-elect Joe Biden; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer; and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. They have known one another for decades, so there will be no surprises. They will be overseeing a Washington where the Senate is perfectly divided between the two parties and the House nearly so—a power alignment that, at least in theory, ought to draw them all a bit closer together near the political center.</td>
