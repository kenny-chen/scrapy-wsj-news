      <td>Robinhood sure is entertaining. But it’s also steering investors toward risky behaviors that could go wrong.</td>
      <td>Technology can make investing easy and fun. It can also downplay risk in ways that may lead novices astray.<br />In last week’s column, I described my experience on the popular Robinhood brokerage app, especially how trading became hard to stop once I started. Now let’s look at how Robinhood may encourage risky behaviors that could backfire.<br />Consider some exchange-traded funds. Leveraged ETFs magnify the daily return of a market index, typically doubling or tripling it. Inverse ETFs deliver the opposite of a market’s one-day return, often amplifying that gain or loss with leverage. Volatility ETFs are a pure play on the short-term fluctuations of stocks or other assets.<br />Such funds are fireballs that can heat up a portfolio—or scorch it. ProShares UltraPro QQQ, or TQQQ, seeks to deliver three times the daily return of the Nasdaq-100 index. It gained 35% in November. During the February-March market panic, it lost 70%.<br />The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, which oversees brokerage firms, has warned these ETFs “typically are unsuitable for retail investors who plan to hold them for longer than one trading session.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—California on Friday filed court papers seeking to join the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google.<br />The Justice Department and a group of 11 state attorneys general, all Republicans, filed the case on Oct. 20 alleging Google uses anticompetitive tactics to preserve a monopoly for its flagship search engine and related advertising business.<br />The company denies the allegations. “People use Google because they choose to, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives,” a Google spokeswoman said Friday. “We’re confident in our position and we’ll continue to make our case in court.”<br />California would be the first Democratic-led state to join the case. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s office didn’t respond to questions about why it decided to join the suit now.<br />Mr. Becerra’s move could help placate Republican critics as he seeks confirmation next year as President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.</td>

      <td>A Wisconsin state judge on Friday rejected a Trump campaign lawsuit seeking to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s narrow victory there, ruling that a partial recount was fairly conducted.<br />The Wisconsin suit is one of the last remaining cases in the Trump campaign’s quest to reverse the Nov. 3 election results, an effort that constitutional scholars have said is unprecedented and unlikely to succeed.<br />President Trump is also supporting a lawsuit filed with the U.S. Supreme Court by the Texas attorney general, arguing that election results in four battleground states Mr. Biden won—Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia—were so flawed they should be thrown out. That suit is supported by at least 17 other Republican attorneys general and 106 GOP members of Congress, but is opposed by Democratic attorneys general and some Republican senators and state officials.<br />In Wisconsin, the Trump campaign sought to have 220,000 mail-in and absentee ballots thrown out from Dane County, home to Madison, and Milwaukee County, the two most urban, diverse and Democratic counties in the state.<br />The campaign earlier requested a recount in those two counties, though the new tally slightly increased Mr. Biden’s lead of about 20,000.</td>

Now those same figures could help decide the fate of Mr. Biden’s policy agenda, particularly with a narrow Democratic majority in the House that includes a contingent of outspoken members.<br />At the same time, Mr. Biden doesn’t want to alienate moderate Democrats and Republicans in the closely divided Senate, which has to confirm his nominees.<br />Mr. Biden formally announced Tom Vilsack as his pick for secretary of Agriculture; Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge for secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Denis McDonough, former chief of staff to President Barack Obama, for secretary of Veterans Affairs; Katherine Tai for U.S. Trade Representative; and former Ambassador Susan Rice as director of the Domestic Policy Council.<br />“Some are familiar faces, some are new in their roles,” Mr Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Del., on Friday. “All are facing new circumstances and challenges.

Over half of Republicans believe the election was “rigged” This may persist in the perception that the Biden administration is now continually under the cloud of illegitimacy. The confidence level in America’s election process has fallen to the level of confidence the electorate has in Congress—dangerous for a form of democratic governance.<br />James Bullard<br />Brighton, Mich.<br /><br />In my little, 80-home neighborhood, the roll of registered voters shows at least five homes with two sets of families, reflecting both the previous and current owners. An additional two people who have died are on the roll. And several young adults who have moved away from their parents’ home are still on the roll. If they had been automatically mailed ballots, more than 10% of homes would have received extra ballots. This is the reality in a state that actually maintains the voter rolls, in a stable neighborhood of mostly middle-aged adults. Imagine what the rate is in, say, an apartment complex.</td>

OMB has one of the most professional workforces in all of government, with unmatched expertise and experience.<br />But I don’t share their overblown concerns about the civil service reforms that President Trump is proposing. Much of the media coverage on the “Schedule F classification” has bordered on the hysterical—claims of “massive government purges” and other easily dismissed boogeymen. Only in D.C. is it this controversial to suggest that federal employees be held accountable for the quality of work they perform.<br />For decades administrations have failed to achieve meaningful civil service reform. Federal employees themselves complain that it is far too difficult to get rid of poor performers. President Trump has found a way to maintain the institutional knowledge and expertise of career professionals who serve permanently and inject accountability for those closest to setting policy.<br />Most people in America serve at the will of their employer and learn to “provide objective and informed advice” while being committed to the organization’s success. This isn’t an unreasonable or outrageous request of federal employees.<br />OMB’s work won’t change: Hard questions will be asked, analysis provided and institutional memory maintained. But the men and women of OMB are not a priestly caste set apart; rather, we are the tip of the spear for implementing a president’s agenda. And that is why OMB must lead in executing this important reform.</td>

      <td>Qualcomm and other chip makers’ shares drop on latest report of Apple’s modem efforts</td>
      <td>Chip makers supplying  Apple  should have learned by now to always consider that business temporary. That doesn’t mean it’s worthless.<br />Intel is only the most recent example, finally losing its place in some of the Mac computer lineup to in-house central processors developed by Apple.  Qualcomm  might be next on the chopping block. Apple’s senior vice president of hardware technologies, Johny Srouji, told employees in a company town hall Thursday that Apple is working on its own modem chips, according to a report by Bloomberg. Modem chips are Qualcomm’s largest business with Apple, with the two companies having recently re-established their relationship following a bitter, multiyear legal dispute.<br />The news took down Qualcomm’s share price by 7.4% Friday. It also seemed to hang over other prominent Apple suppliers such as  Broadcom ,   Qorvo  and  Skyworks Solutions .  All supply radio frequency, or RF, components used in the iPhone. Broadcom shares were down 1% in morning trading despite the company having reported strong results for its fiscal fourth quarter late Thursday. Atif Malik of Citi predicted that Apple would likely look to in-source RF chips after it develops its own modem, given how tightly those components have to work together.<br />But even for Qualcomm, the pain of being replaced by Apple is still some way off—if it happens at all. Mr. Srouji said Apple’s modem effort just kicked off this year, and he described it as a “long-term strategic investment.” The settlement the two companies struck last year included a six-year licensing deal and a “multiyear” chip-supply agreement. Qualcomm’s strong lead in 5G technology was a key factor in driving that settlement, and it isn’t an area in which even Apple will be able to catch up quickly. Tim Arcuri of  UBS  noted Friday that “broad proliferation of a captive modem” on Apple’s part would likely require more expertise in radio-frequency technology that the company may have to acquire through M&A.<br />Apple is ambitious and has deep pockets, along with a well-known desire to control as much of its key technology as it can. That is a risk hanging over any chip company doing business with the tech giant. But those efforts don’t happen overnight: It took Apple a decade to field a competitive PC chip after building its first in-house central processors for the iPhone. That leaves a lot of business that can be done in the meantime, and chip makers who keep their technology well ahead of the pack can maintain their position even longer.</td>

      <td>Out-of-state groups drop millions in support of a job-killing ballot measure to soak small businesses.</td>
      <td>Phoenix<br />Much of the dust has settled from the 2020 election, but in Arizona one legal battle is just beginning. It’s a fight over the largest tax increase in the state’s history, and it’s a cautionary tale for the rest of the country—or at least for those who care about protecting their states from an onslaught of job-killing progressive policies.<br />That fight centers on Proposition 208, a ballot initiative that imposes a billion-dollar tax hike. It nearly doubles the income taxes imposed on small businesses and individuals making more than $250,000 a year, raising the marginal rate from 4.5% to 8%, with the funds supposedly going to education (though there’s no guarantee that will actually happen). What is certain is that the tax will have disastrous economic consequences, including the loss of more than 100,000 jobs and a significant drop in revenue to local and state coffers, according to a study published by the Goldwater Institute.<br />Late last month, a coalition of legislators, taxpayers, and small-business groups filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 208. The Arizona Constitution clearly limits how the state can raise and spend money on education. Proposition 208 attempts to evade those limits.<br />Proponents of Proposition 208 could have asked Arizonans to amend the Constitution. They had plenty of time to collect the necessary signatures to get such a question on the ballot. Instead they decided to put their tax increase proposal before voters as ordinary legislation. They did so even after warnings about the measure’s constitutionality, including from the nonpartisan Legislative Council. Because Proposition 208 was passed as a statute rather than a constitutional amendment, it can’t override the Arizona Constitution. Proposition 208 also attempts to invade the Legislature’s ability to pass a budget and allocate funding for everything from higher education and public safety to government responses to the coronavirus pandemic.</td>

      <td>The streaming service wants to create a ‘cultural moment’ in documentaries that all seem to tilt left—especially against cops.</td>
      <td>Andrew Colborn says  Netflix  ruined his life. As a sheriff’s sergeant, he helped convict a murderer in 2007. Eight years later, the streaming service debuted a documentary series suggesting Mr. Colborn and his law-enforcement colleagues had framed an innocent man. Tens of millions watched, the show won four Emmys, and Mr. Colborn became infamous.<br />Before “Making a Murderer” aired, a Google search of his name “would have revealed two nondescript news articles about routine local crime,” he alleges in a lawsuit. Now it turns up hundreds of thousands. He and his family have received violent threats that “fill the capacity of 28 compact discs,” the lawsuit claims. (Mr. Colborn, who retired in 2018, declined an interview request.)<br />Netflix has made a major push into original documentaries. Lisa Nishimura, who oversees the effort, has said the company’s objective is to “create a cultural moment” and “allow people to enter a distinct experience to help us try to better understand the world around us.” In 2018 Barack and Michelle Obama cut a multiyear production deal with Netflix, and Mr. Obama said last year that their productions would touch “on issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights.”<br />“Making a Murderer” is the streaming giant’s most famous documentary. I examined thousands of pages of courtroom transcripts, police reports and other public records. They leave little doubt that the series is dishonest. Examples abound of selectively edited footage and omission or distortion of key facts.<br />“Making a Murderer” is particularly egregious, but it’s part of a broader campaign by Netflix against police and in support of progressive causes. Former prosecutor Linda Fairsteindescribed in these pages last year how another documentary, “When They See Us,” was “so full of distortions and falsehoods as to be an outright fabrication.” Texas Ranger Bob Prince has also complained about significant omissions and distortions in the 2019 series “The Confessions Killer.” The Netflix cultural moments always tilt in the same political direction.</td>

Disney unveiled an array of new shows and bullish revised guidance Thursday that made clear its trio of streaming services—Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+—would seek to take on market leader  Netflix Inc.  in several arenas, including spending on content and the hunt for subscribers around the world.<br />In addition to announcing plans for 100 new titles to debut annually, Disney revised guidance that had previously predicted Disney+ could hit 90 million subscribers by 2024. The new projection was an earthquake: as many as 260 million. Netflix currently has 200 million subscribers, but it isn’t growing as quickly. Other streaming upstarts, like WarnerMedia’s HBO Max and NBCUniversal’s Peacock are far behind.<br />Wall Street sent Disney stock to an all-time high Friday, with shares rising about 14% in afternoon trading to around $176.<br />The Disney presentation capped one of the most acrimonious weeks in Hollywood’s focus on streaming. On one end, there was  AT&T Inc.’s  Warner Bros.

      <td>President opposes provision that would lead to renaming military installations honoring Confederate figures</td>
      <td>The U.S. Senate voted 84-13 on Friday to approve a bipartisan defense-policy bill over President Trump’s objections, with support for the legislation exceeding the two-thirds majority needed to override any eventual veto.<br />The National Defense Authorization Act is an annual bill that sets pay rates for troops and authorizes funds for military construction projects, aircraft, ships, nuclear weapons and other national-security programs. Congress has passed it on a bipartisan basis for 59 years in a row. Earlier this week, the House approved final passage by a veto-proof 335-78 majority. The bill will now go to the president’s desk<br />The lopsided votes in both chambers came in the face of Mr. Trump’s strong opposition, as most GOP lawmakers—including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and other Republican leaders—rejected his demands to alter the bill’s text in the waning weeks of his presidency. Among the exceptions were a few Republican senators whose names have been floated as possible future presidential contenders: Sens. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) and Josh Hawley (R., Mo.). A total of 7 Republicans and 6 Democrats voted no.<br />Mr. Trump has said he would veto the NDAA unless Congress eliminates language that creates a commission to rename military installations, monuments and paraphernalia honoring Confederate commanders. He also has insisted on including language in the bill to terminate Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which grants social-media companies broad immunity for the content they publish from users on their sites.<br />In a statement of opposition issued Tuesday, the Trump administration said it strongly opposes the NDAA because it “fails to include critical national-security measures, includes provisions that fail to respect our veterans and our military’s history, and contradicts efforts by this Administration to put America first in our national-security and foreign-policy actions.”</td>

      <td>Limited availability of approved vaccines dims hopes of imminent end to pandemic, economic distress</td>
      <td>Europe has been hoping to vaccinate swaths of its population in the space of months, counting on several vaccines becoming available this winter. Instead, a shortage of effective shots means the pandemic could batter the region deep into 2021, straining hospitals and hampering economic recovery.<br />Regulatory, scientific and logistical challenges make it likely that only two vaccines—one from  Pfizer Inc.  and partner  BioNTech SE  and another by  Moderna Inc. —will become available soon in European Union countries. Those two alone can’t satisfy the heavy global demand. Other vaccines the EU was counting on to cover its 450 million people are struggling to reach the finish line.<br />The U.K., a non-EU country, became the first Western country to launch its vaccination program, rolling out the Pfizer shot on Dec. 8 at dozens of hospitals around the country. Next week, the U.K. plans to extend the program to involve local physicians.<br />EU countries must wait at least another month. The bloc’s drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency, is set to give its opinion on the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 29 and on Moderna’s on Jan. 12. Many EU countries are planning to start administering the Pfizer vaccine in January, starting with elderly people, health-care workers and other high-priority groups.<br />Most European countries haven’t laid out concrete timetables for vaccinating their populations, amid uncertainty over how many doses of approved vaccines will be available when.</td>

      <td>Torah shields, Hanukkah lamps and other items owned by a celebrated family from Baghdad will be auctioned at Sotheby’s next week.</td>
      <td>The Sassoon family, a commercial and financial dynasty of Baghdadi Jewish origin, cut a globalized path through the 19th and early 20th centuries on a scale remarkable even by today’s standards. The family did business everywhere from British India to pre-Communist Shanghai, while putting down roots in Britain. They were also prodigious collectors of Jewish ritual objects and manuscripts. On Dec. 17, key pieces of Judaica owned by members of the Sassoon family will be auctioned at Sotheby’s New York.<br />The Sassoons became prominent in 18th-century Baghdad, where they served as financial advisers to local Ottoman rulers. David Sassoon, who oversaw the family’s move from Baghdad to India in the 1830s, flourished thanks to Britain’s expanding mercantile power, though he never learned to speak English. Even in Bombay (today’s Mumbai), however, “the family staunchly maintained Baghdadi traditions,” says Sharon Liberman Mintz, senior consultant for Judaica at Sotheby’s. One item in the auction is a gold-brocaded silk robe made for Ezekiel Gubbay, son of another prominent Baghdadi Jewish family, for his marriage to David Sassoon’s granddaughter Aziza in 1853; though made in India, it was designed in a Baghdadi style.<br />Flora Sassoon, Aziza’s daughter, became the matriarch of the most pious branch of the family in Britain, and her son, noted London bibliophile David Solomon Sassoon, expanded its collection of Jewish objects and manuscripts. The member of the family who is best known today, the World War I poet Siegfried Sassoon, belonged to a different branch; his father was disinherited after marrying outside the Jewish faith.<br />Two 18th-century parcel-gilt silver and enamel Torah shields, starring items in the auction, were bequeathed to Flora by a Sassoon relation. In the Ashkenazi Jewish tradition of Central and Eastern Europe, such breastplate-like shields are placed on the textile mantle covering a Torah scroll. Jewish religious life in early modern Europe was rich in such ornamental objects, but Ms. Liberman Mintz says that more often than not they were made by Christians, since Jews usually weren’t allowed to join craftsmen’s guilds.<br />These Torah shields are an exception. Here “we have a Jewish artisan looking at Jewish sources,” Ms. Liberman Mintz says. One shield is signed by its maker, Elimelekh Tzoref of Stanislav, a Polish town now in Ukraine. The front shows the figures of Moses and Aaron, while the back displays biblical scenes and imagery surrounded by a rococo arch. The piece has a pre-auction estimate of $600,000 to $900,000.</td>

      <td>A newly finished restoration of the Empire State Building gives us the chance to again appreciate the structure’s glittering brilliance.</td>
      <td>The Empire State Building is an expression of Jazz Age exuberance so familiar we can easily miss it. Be sure to look at it now, though, because the building has never appeared brighter. A bottom-to-top restoration, 15 years in the making, has just wrapped up at the circular observation level on the 102nd floor and returned the building to its original wonder.<br />And what a wonder it is. An encrustation of obsolete radio equipment and dunnage has been removed from around its spire, or “mooring mast,” and relocated to the single top antenna spike. The sky-high work has revealed the full glistening form of this faceted glass lantern and its four aluminum wings. Cleaned, sealed and repainted, the building now never stops shining, again able to reflect sunlight by day just as it glows from inner illumination by night.<br />The final, astonishing masterpiece of the Roaring ’20s, the Empire State Building opened in the Depression-plagued 1930s as “the eighth wonder of the world.” Its appeal has always seemed historic, not just of one particular age but one for the ages. Ninety years ago, returning to New York for the first time since the Crash, F. Scott Fitzgerald observed this “last and most magnificent of towers” as rising “from the ruins, lonely and inexplicable as the sphinx.” From the moment it was first sketched out to its completion just 18 months later, on up to the travails of the present day, Empire State has been there to elevate us out of our street-level depressions.<br />The term “mooring mast” should suggest the particular magic of Empire State’s design. When a former General Motors executive named John J. Raskob wanted to construct a singular office building at 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, he looked to the architect William Lamb to design a tower that would rise with unprecedented speed from this central plot of Manhattan Island. Lamb edited his tower back to the essentials of machine-made form. The design cut every corner but the ones that mattered. An army of actual skywalkers would slot in 600 million pounds of prefabricated steel, limestone, and chrome-nickel panels. Light, strength and lift were everything as the enterprise aimed to become the tallest building in the world.<br />The office-level floors of Empire State wear these considerations right on their face. The building’s smooth skin has little want of setbacks or shadows. Its minimal articulations balance height and mass in classical proportions with only the most distilled Art Deco details. What matters are the window lines of glistening metal all connecting, all pointing up.</td>

These targets will have to be set within the next year and reviewed every five years, with the aim to have all of the group’s assets under management eventually included, the group said in a statement.<br />The pledge is the latest effort by asset managers, including asset management firm  BlackRock Inc.,  to encourage companies they invest in for their clients to meet higher environmental standards. BlackRock, however, hasn’t signed onto this initiative.<br />Many of the recent green commitments haven’t specified consequences for companies that don’t meet the emissions targets.</td>

Yet most Americans won’t get vaccinated until spring or summer, according to health authorities.<br />Supplies won’t be sufficient to make a serious difference in the coronavirus pandemic this winter, said BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin. BioNTech and Pfizer are scaling up production with the aim of being able to produce up to 100 million doses by January at the latest, he said.</td>

      <td>Bidders have little to lose in the first auction of federal leases for oil production in California in eight years.</td>
      <td>In what was either expensive political point-scoring or an absolute steal in the energy market, the first federal leases for oil and gas development in California in eight years were auctioned on Thursday.<br />The Trump administration announced plans last year to auction leases on about a million acres of federal land in California, setting off a flurry of legal challenges in the environmentally conscious state. In the end it came down to just 4,133 acres in Kern County, where there are existing oil fields. The Bureau of Land Management estimated that up to 10 wells could be drilled on the newly leased parcels.<br />Taxpayers didn’t get much for all the trouble—only $53,562, the price of less than 1,200 barrels of crude. That could be an amazing deal for the companies that purchased the leases, even after paying rent plus royalties on any oil produced. Federal leases adjacent to producing properties have fetched prices 30 or more times as much per acre.<br />The purchases are a bet that legal challenges won’t stop development. President-elect Joe Biden has said he will ban new leases on public lands; so there also could be attempts to reverse such deals, but the buyers would largely be made whole. They may annoy some government officials, and ultimately the purchasers don’t have much to lose.<br />Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com</td>

      <td>With concerts and festivals canceled due to the pandemic, musical artists moved performances online and still released a trove of outstanding records.</td>
      <td><br />On Feb. 28, the K-Pop band BTS canceled its April tour dates in South Korea because of the coronavirus. It was one of the earliest instances of a major musical name realizing that putting on concerts in 2020 was about to get difficult, and live music in the U.S. was upended shortly thereafter. By the time the SXSW Festival was canceled on March 6 and then Coachella on March 10 postponed its event until October—only to remove it from the calendar entirely in June—it became clear that live shows weren’t coming back anytime soon.<br />And so 2020 turned into the year each of us, individually, reconfigured how music fit into our lives. If your fandom extended to concerts in any form, you felt that loss, deeply. Musicians pivoted, experimenting with streaming shows and unconventional events of all kinds. Verzuz, a webcast series started by veteran producers Timbaland and Swizz Beats, found high-profile artists in hip-hop and R&B facing off in DJ battles where they played the best songs from their own catalogs in live-streamed competitions. Paid performances included sets from artists including Billie Eilish, Nick Cave and many others. Oklahoma psychedelic rock band the Flaming Lips even staged a show in which they encased each audience member in a one-person plastic bubble.<br />Though online events allowed fans to gather virtually to hear music together and also sometimes offered financial support to cash-strapped artists—a year without shows devastated those who depend on concerts to pay the bills—the gap between watching music digitally and seeing it in person is enormous. Live gigs create a space where anything can happen, and the uncertainty raises the excitement. A screen, which drastically reduces the amount of information that reaches our senses, inevitably shrinks possibilities.<br />Even in this altered reality, albums from artists big and small kept coming all year. If only a few releases seemed like true events, we might blame our fragmented attention and the difficulty of promoting new music when live performance was off the table. Absent the typical spate of extra-musical activity—television appearances, festival gigs—it was easy to lose track of records just weeks after they came out. To remedy that, here’s a rundown of 10 of the best from this strangest of years.</td>

      <td>An author of cookbooks devoted to the gastronomic potential of plants still eats meat occasionally</td>
      <td>In the late 1970s, vegetables were garnish, a way to add color to a meal’s main event. Meat-averse diners were a nuisance at restaurants and tedious at dinner parties. Tofu was for hippies.<br />So what could one possibly serve at a fine-dining restaurant if meat wasn’t on the menu? For Deborah Madison, the founding chef of Greens, an upmarket vegetarian spot that opened in San Francisco in 1979, this question kept her up at night. “I tried to imagine some tired man dully anticipating a plate with a big hole in the middle where the meat would have been,” she writes in her recently published memoir, “An Onion in My Pocket: My Life with Vegetables.” Crafting nice salads and appetizers from local produce was easy enough, as most diners had lower expectations for smaller plates. But what entree would sate the habitual carnivore who had been dragged by a loved one to Greens?<br />Ms. Madison’s elegant answers to this question not only made Greens a success but helped redefine plant-based dining in America. Decades before “farm-to-table” food became chic, she loaded her car with fresh herbs and vegetables grown nearby and planned her menu by the “sweet perfumes” wafting from the back seat. To create a sense of occasion, she often folded, wrapped or stacked her main dishes and used plenty of butter, cream and cheese. Meals that sound familiar today—such as a mushroom ragout or an artichoke, leek and goat-cheese tart—were revelatory then.<br />“People didn’t miss the meat,” says Alice Waters of the famed restaurant Chez Panisse in nearby Berkeley, Calif. “They came for the flavors, the ambience and the sense of beauty in the food.”<br />Having recently revisited the cookbook of Greens recipes she co-wrote in 1987, Ms. Madison admits that she was “horrified” to see so much cheese. “We were really insecure,” she says with a chuckle over the phone from her home near Santa Fe, where she has lived for the past 30 years with her husband, Patrick McFarlin, a painter and graphic designer. In her eagerness to ensure that Greens’s patrons felt satisfied, she says she added cheese to nearly everything.</td>

      <td>President Trump’s decision to recognize Morocco’s sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara region ends American neutrality in a conflict that threatens to destabilize a corner of North Africa critical to U.S. and European security interests.<br />Morocco’s decadeslong conflict with Western Sahara independence fighters had been dormant until last month. Fighting broke out again in November after nearly three decades in which a United Nations-brokered cease-fire helped maintain relations between Morocco and Algeria, the main backer of the independence movement. Both countries are important security partners of both the U.S. and Europe.<br />If the violence goes unchecked, observers warn it could damage security in the broader region, drawing in criminal networks smuggling weapons and contraband that could link it with conflicts in Libya, Mali and Niger.<br />“This is an issue that needs attention, needs resolution, and is moving from a simmer into a low boil. Trump has just turned up the fire,” said Hannah Rae Armstrong, an independent expert on the conflict.<br />Mr. Trump’s proclamation on Thursday backed Morocco’s claim to Western Sahara in return for opening diplomatic relations with Israel, the fourth country to do so since August as a part of a White House effort to broker relations between the Jewish-led state and Middle Eastern neighbors.</td>

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a reading of 75.5.<br />Rosier expectations for the economy drove the index’s rebound, though respondents’ views on current economic conditions improved as well.<br />“Most of the early December gain was due to a more favorable long-term outlook for the economy, while year-ahead prospects for the economy as well as personal finances remained unchanged,” said Richard Curtin, the survey’s chief economist.<br />A partisan skew in views was responsible for much of the upward shift in sentiment, Mr. Curtin said, with Democrats becoming more optimistic about the economy and Republicans more pessimistic, following President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election.</td>

      <td>The paradox of ‘a jewel in the midst of a marsh.’</td>
      <td>In late antiquity, even before the fall of the western Roman empire, all roads began to lead away from Rome. Emperors abandoned the old capital and moved closer to the frontiers. In the east, they resided at Nicomedia, Thessalonike and eventually Constantinople, Constantine the Great’s “New Rome” on the Bosporus, founded in A.D. 330. Trier was their preferred headquarters in Gaul, and Milan their city of choice in northern Italy. In the fifth century, as the empire began to collapse and was invaded by barbarian armies who threatened Rome’s food supply, ordinary people also moved away from the former capital, whose population gradually declined. In the summer of 402, with Goths crossing the Alps, the western emperor Honorius moved his court to Ravenna, a naval base on the Adriatic. It had an excellent harbor from which he could (and did) receive reinforcements from his brother at Constantinople. The place was surrounded by swamps and rivers, making it famously difficult to besiege, and its “undeveloped urban plan . . . allowed the imperial court to impose its presence.”<br />Judith Herrin’s recent book contains a sweeping and engrossing history of Ravenna from the moment Honorius took up residence there, through the thriving period of Gothic rule (493-540), and culminating in the two centuries (540-751) when the city was a western outpost of the eastern Roman empire. In that last phase, the city was the capital of a territory called the exarchate, whose commander, the exarch, was sent from Constantinople. Ms. Herrin, a professor emerita of classics at King’s College London, is a past master at writing histories of the early medieval world that combine Eastern and Western perspectives and show why we should not study the one without the other. “Ravenna” offers an accessible narrative that brings to life the men and women who created the city during this period and who fashioned its hybrid Christian culture of Latin, Greek and Gothic elements. The narrative is periodically elevated by discussions of the city’s most famous attractions and its glorious churches, brilliantly illustrated in the book’s 62 color plates. It is also enlivened by recurring digressions on daily life in the city at each phase in its history, insofar as that is revealed by documentary papyri containing wills, donations and contracts that fortuitously survive. These local perspectives are complemented by a global outlook: Ms. Herrin’s argument is that Ravenna passed its unique hybrid culture on to the imperial centers all around it, to Rome, Constantinople, and later to Aachen, the capital of Charlemagne in the north. This made the city the “crucible of Europe.”<br />Ravenna, a jewel in the midst of a marsh, was a place of paradox. It was, to allude to a collection of Ms. Herrin’s previous studies, simultaneously both metropolis and margin. In the era of the late Roman emperors (fifth century), the city hosted the court but had a relatively small population compared to Rome and was always looking toward developments at Rome and Constantinople. It was, at first, an administrative center with no identity, a kind of Brasilia that was only slowly built up by the court in its own imperial Christian image. The place had no prestige past of its own, either classical or Christian. Under the rule of Theoderic the Great (493-526), Ravenna was briefly the capital of a power structure that stretched from Spain to the Balkans, but Theoderic still had to maneuver carefully between Rome and Constantinople. In theory, he was ruling the former on behalf of the latter, and his followers, who were barbarians (Goths) and heretics (Arians) in the eyes of the Romans, were an occupying force that were stationed in the north and away from the old capital. The Gothic experiment did not last once the eastern emperor Justinian decided to end it in the 530s. Under Byzantine rule, Ravenna was the capital of the exarchate, and gradually developed its own civic traditions and identity, but still it received its governing class from abroad, and people at the real center of power, Constantinople, saw it as a remote outpost. Ravenna “could not generate and direct its own future” and “was never fully its own agent.” It was a capital of convenience, we might say.<br />And yet each successive regime that ruled in Ravenna not only left its mark there, it was in that city more than anywhere else that it left its most iconic images. No late Roman imperial church can compete with the mosaics of the churches of Ravenna. Likewise no barbarian kingdom that emerged in post-Roman Europe left anything that can compete with Theoderic’s palace church of Sant’Apollinare Nuovo or his mausoleum, capped by a 230-ton block of Istrian stone (the only actual Gothic building in Europe, apart from some minor chapels in Spain). Finally, the most spectacular images of Byzantine imperial power are the famous panel mosaics of Justinian and Theodora in the church of San Vitale. Why was Ravenna endowed with such a density of exemplary images?<br />One explanation is that its successive rulers were trying to leave their mark on a place that was previously undemarcated, to project their power onto an urban topography that did not already convey the desired message in the way that Rome and Constantinople did. Moreover, as Ms. Herrin argues, they were competing with each other in a visual arms-race. Galla Placidia, Honorius’ half-sister, had adorned San Giovanni Evangelista with images of her many imperial ancestors, which led Theoderic to put his own image in Sant’Apollinare Nuovo. This, in turn, provoked Justinian to put his and his wife’s images in San Vitale. (An eastern Roman emperor would otherwise not normally put his image in a church.) As Ravenna wound its circuitous historical route from west Roman to Gothic and then to east Roman rule, it acquired the visual armature of all three, as they competed to own this marginal centerpiece.</td>

      <td>The photographer known for his images of the celebrated was also a chronicler of subterranean fears.</td>
      <td>In the middle of September 1952, Charlie Chaplin came to Richard Avedon’s photo studio. Avedon, then 29, had been chasing him for years, but Chaplin never answered his letters. And then the phone rang. Avedon thought it was a joke and hung up, but Chaplin called back and said he was coming right over. Avedon sent his assistants out of the studio so that there would be no distractions.<br />At first, Avedon shot a few pictures straight on, “almost as though I was doing a passport picture.” When Avedon thought he had his shot, Chaplin asked, “Now, I could do something for you.” He lowered his head, and came up grinning in extreme closeup, with his fingers forming horns on the side of his head—the great god Pan. Or, if you believed Joe McCarthy, J. Edgar Hoover and their anticommunist minions, Satan incarnate. Chaplin did it once more, and the second time was the keeper. That night Chaplin and his family left for London to premiere his film “Limelight.” Two days out of New York, Chaplin’s re-entry permit was revoked by U.S. authorities. He wouldn’t come back to America for 20 years.<br />“I can’t take responsibility for this picture,” Avedon would write. “It was one of those perfect moments when the light was right, and I was there, and the sitter offered the photographer a gift . . . the kind of gift that arrives once in a lifetime.”<br />The photographer was being unnecessarily modest. There were too many pictures like that in Richard Avedon’s life for them to have been glorious accidents. All photographers want to get a great shot, but Avedon went a step beyond: he wanted to get the definitive shot, and he often did. Think of his Marilyn Monroe, looking off-camera and lost, as if her dog had just died. Avedon’s best work came from a place of joy, or, failing that, enthrallment—Chaplin of course, Jean Renoir, Dovima and the elephants.<br />His most uncomfortably startling work derived from contempt—his series of portraits of his elderly father, a man he disliked and for good reason. Jack Avedon thought his son was soft and overly sensitive, and provided a grim counterexample by dumping Avedon’s mother and refusing to support her.</td>

      <td>Selected by Phillip Lopate, editor of ‘The Glorious American Essay.’</td>
      <td>By Mary McCarthy (1961)<br />1. These essays, accumulated from 1946 to 1961, offer a vivid, stimulating challenge to that “age of conformity.” If variety is a charm of essay collections, their bane can be a random unevenness—here overcome by a furiously cool, contrarian intelligence, which unifies this assortment of pieces about politics, literature, sex, theater and fashion. Questioning with aphoristic zingers the Kinsey Reports’ mechanistic approach to the female orgasm, the journalistic pieties of John Hersey’s “Hiroshima,” the upwardly mobile aspirations of women’s fashion magazines, the genius of Tennessee Williams, the anti-American tourist reports of Simone de Beauvoir, the outrages of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Mary McCarthy spares neither the right nor the left—nor herself. In “My Confession,” she describes how, starting out from the wrong motives—ignorance, shallowness, vanity, social snobbery—she arrived at a coherent liberal anticommunist position. “I realized, with a certain wistfulness, that it was too late for me to become a Marxist. Marxism, I saw, from the learned young men I listened to at Committee meetings, was something you had to take up young, like ballet dancing.”<br />Edited by Katharine Ogden Michaels (2009)<br />2. A master of the short story, whose tales conveyed high anxiety, urban violence and exuberant intellectual analysis, Leonard Michaels was also an extraordinarily fine essayist. This collection, assembled posthumously by his widow, Katharine Michaels, is divided between critical and autobiographical essays, though everything Michaels wrote was deeply personal. Whether seeing as a boy the movie “Gilda,” where the heroine marries a sadist played by George Macready (“I didn’t want Macready to unzipper Rita Hayworth’s dress”), or his father offering him some money before his date (“He gave. I took.”), Michaels gets to feelings of vulnerability and shame with astonishing speed. Raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan by Jewish immigrant parents, speaking only Yiddish until he was 5, he perfected a terse English sentence that carries traces of Yiddish’s ironic, singsong, questioning shrug. “Paradox as a cognitive mode is everywhere in Yiddish. It’s probably in the genes and may explain the Jewish love of jokes.” His humor is both hilarious and dark, issuing from an evolved persona that had elements of the street-savvy hipster, academic and Talmudist. Above all, he was a storyteller—proof positive that good essays are at bottom stories about the mind at work.<br />By Vladimir Nabokov (1951)</td>

      <td>National politics may be paralyzed by partisanship, but states, cities and ordinary citizens are coming together to get things done.</td>
      <td>As debate about police behavior raged over the summer in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, the nation’s elected leaders in Washington seemed unable to agree on any response, except perhaps to amplify the shouting.<br />In Kansas City, Mo., however, Mayor Quinton Lucas took the simplest of steps to build public confidence in police accountability: He moved to make it easier for a citizen to file a complaint about police behavior, in part by removing a strange legal requirement that any complaint had to be notarized. “Washington did not become a place for positive results in law-enforcement reform,” says Mr. Lucas, who is a Democrat.<br />Similarly, while the national debate over abortion rights has escalated in response to Donald Trump’s Supreme Court appointments, Kathleen Wilson, the founder of a program in Fredericksburg, Va., that provides homes for pregnant women seeking an alternative to abortion, raised enough money to finish buying a house for expectant mothers. She had enough funds left over to help young mothers unable to make rent payments amid the coronavirus economic slump. “I don’t think of this ministry as being political,” she says of her organization, Mary’s Shelter. “We try not to be.”<br />And while national politicians lapsed into finger-pointing over shortages of masks and surgical gowns during the pandemic, two businesswomen in Morganton, N.C., organized a network of small textile companies in the area to begin producing half a million masks and surgical gowns for the region’s doctors, hospitals, businesses and citizens. “In the early days it was like Rosie the Riveter,” says Sara Chester, one of the businesswomen. “Everybody wanted to do their part.”<br />There are potentially big lessons in such small steps. At a time of deepening national divisions and political tribalism, many Americans have decided to rely less on Washington to deal with problems and have turned for answers to local institutions, state governments, business leaders, their own communities and one another.</td>

In their first day of trading, shares of Airbnb closed more than double where they were priced just one day earlier. DoorDash closed Thursday 82% higher than its own initial-public-offering price. Airbnb is now worth more than five times the implied post-money valuation of its debt raise back in April, according to PitchBook, and more than the combined market values of several of its largest hotel competitors.<br />Day traders aren’t rushing into these names just for the fun of it. Low interest rates have almost forced anyone looking to make meaningful returns this year into the public markets, explaining in part the record number of blank-check companies that have recently listed. But this week’s traditional listings seem to be at the center of all that is trending in 2020, most notably the acceleration of the shift toward online commerce.<br />The pandemic has made businesses which have brought safety and ease to how we travel and eat seem not only attractive but essential in the near term. And as opposed to fellow unicorns like Uber and  Lyft ,  who have yet to turn a profit, both DoorDash and Airbnb have managed to turn a profit on a select basis for some period of the year and have outshone their competitors.<br />With so many consumers fleeing the big cities over the last several months, Airbnb has pared down its ambitions to become a broader hospitality conglomerate to emphasize its homestay accommodations in more remote locations. DoorDash has welcomed the urban exodus with open arms, having built their business to capitalize on suburban markets from the beginning.</td>

But after Alpine skiing made its Olympics debut in 1936 and gained popularity, sleek new styles began to appear. A savvy, newly mobile community embraced the pastime during the post-WWII years, triggering an explosion of technical, fashion-forward mountain-wear brands.<br />During this midcentury era, designers like  Christian Dior  and Emilio Pucci introduced sport lines for their jet-set clients, while now-classic ski labels like Obermeyer and Bogner took off. Maria Bogner (wife to Olympics skier Willy Bogner, who founded the brand) took issue with existing bulky alpine design and created the first stretch ski-pant in 1948, a style the Bogner catalog still features today.<br />In the ’70s and ’80s, silhouettes slimmed down even further, a movement led by racing brands like Spyder, launched in 1978. Boot-cut pants and neon colors glided into the on-slope mix. In the rebellious ’90s, splatter prints were popular, and the early 2000s welcomed the baggy, oversize look favored by snowboarders.<br />Today, anything goes. Brands like Perfect Moment offer retro, tightfitting ski pants with padded racing knees, while environmentally conscious companies like Helly Hansen and Patagonia are investing in chemical-free production and recycled fabrics.</td>

In our 70s and 80s, we are happier than when we were strong and beautiful 20-year-olds.<br />There are a couple of theories about why this is. We may get better at avoiding stressful situations—we figure out how to dodge that tense work meeting or family squabble. Or there may be something about aging that makes it easier to tolerate stress, even when we can’t avoid it.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic is a test case for this principle. It’s a terrible threat that is stressful for everyone, but it’s especially dangerous for older people, who are far more likely to die from the disease.

      <td>Inmate the second of six scheduled to die during presidential transition</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Brandon Bernard was executed Thursday, the second of six federal inmates scheduled to die between Election Day and Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden, who opposes capital punishment, takes office.<br />Mr. Bernard, 40 years old, received a lethal injection of pentobarbital at the federal penitentiary at Terre Haute, Ind., shortly after a divided Supreme Court declined to grant a stay of execution. He was pronounced dead at 9:27 p.m., according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.<br />The Terre Haute prison is scheduled to execute another federal inmate, Alfred Bourgeois, on Friday.<br />In 1999, at age 18, Mr. Bernard took part in a Killeen, Texas, carjacking that ended in a double murder on the grounds of Fort Hood. His attorneys argued his sentence was improper after recently disclosed evidence indicated that prosecutors withheld information allegedly casting doubt on his propensity for future violence, a factor essential to the government’s argument for the death penalty.<br />Under a landmark Supreme Court case from 1963, Brady v. Maryland, the government is obliged to turn over exculpatory evidence when the defense requests. In October, President Trump signed the bipartisan Due Process Protections Act, which requires that federal judges take steps ensuring that prosecutors comply with the 1963 precedent.  The new law didn’t apply to Mr. Bernard’s case retroactively.</td>

      <td>Not long ago, voters in North Dakota and South Dakota sent Democrats to Congress, while voters in Connecticut sent Republicans. But today, the Farm Belt elects few Democrats, while the Northeast elects few Republicans.<br />The nation’s political divisions are rooted in geographic divisions, a trend that is clearly revealed by the changing party control of seats in the House of Representatives. Two decades of House maps show how Democrats have become the party of metropolitan America, particularly in the Northeast and the West. By contrast, Republicans are dominant in the heartland and in less-populous places outside the big metros, particularly in the South and much of the Midwest.<br />The chart below shows that in almost every election, the party that gains seats does so in all regions of the country. But amid those changes, the nation’s geographic divide has widened. While the Northeast and West in 2000 showed much different political profiles than the South, those differences are substantially wider today.<br />House maps over time show the changing contours of the parties’ strength in different parts of the nation.<br />The House map produced by the election of 2000 shows Democratic blue in North Dakota and northern Minnesota as well as splashes of blue in central Missouri, West Virginia and the Carolinas. Many of these regions were represented by “Blue Dog’’ Democrats, or centrist members of the party who won support from voters in rural communities, small towns and smaller metros.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Congress is grappling with whether lawmakers should be among the first to receive the coronavirus vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve on an emergency basis in coming days.<br />The authorization is expected to lead to distribution by year’s end to limited groups such as health-care workers and the elderly, with several months until the general public is able to get vaccinated. Now policy makers face the question of whether lawmakers should receive priority as important elected officials and to give the public confidence in the vaccine—or whether they should wait in line with their constituents.<br />“There are ongoing discussions,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said on Wednesday. “Of course, many qualify in terms of the high-risk groups, in terms of age. But in addition to that, clearly, it is critical that we have the Congress in a condition where it can operate on a continuing basis, given the challenges that confront us of great immediacy.”<br />The Senate’s health-panel chairman, Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), said he had early Wednesday told Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and other public officials they needed to decide when lawmakers should be vaccinated.<br />“If they want public figures to take the vaccine early in order to reassure Americans that it’s safe, I’m sure many of us will do that,” Mr. Alexander said he told Mr. Redfield. “They need to say it’s more important for public figures to take it in order to encourage people to do it. If they do that, I’ll be glad to take it, but I’m not going to do that on my own. I’m going to do it when the public-health officials tell me it’s my turn.”</td>

      <td>The 2020 Major League Soccer season—in its normal, pre-pandemic form—lasted less than two weeks before grinding to a halt. Teams in early March were barely two games in. NYC FC was still waiting for its first goal. Inter Miami hadn’t even broken out its home jerseys.<br />As it turned out, that was only a false start. What followed over the next nine months was the wildest schedule attempted by any professional sports league in America.<br />When resuming the regular season seemed impossible, MLS rushed back to the field before the NBA or Major League Baseball to play a brand new tournament, invented specifically for 2020, inside a bubble in Florida. Once that worked out, MLS doubled down. Not only would it pick up its regular season—it would send teams back to their home markets to finish the interrupted season. While they were at it, MLS tacked on a full playoff slate for them too.<br />By the time the 2020 season ends, after Saturday’s MLS Cup final between the Seattle Sounders and the Columbus Crew, the league will have somehow organized 324 games in the year of the pandemic.<br />“We had no sense whatsoever that we’d be able to pull that off,” MLS Commissioner Don Garber said this week, looking back on the longest season in the league’s 25-year history.</td>

      <td>Entertainment titan’s ambitious new subscriber targets could put it past streaming pioneer</td>
      <td>Walt Disney Co.  only seems like a cautious company.<br />Fairly new to the streaming world, the entertainment giant has caught on quick. Disney+, its first streaming service under its flagship brand that only launched last November, now has 86.8 million paying subscribers. That’s about where the company first thought it would land after five years, and the success of the effort has convinced Disney to rethink its priorities—and pour some gas on the fire. The company announced late Thursday that its new target for Disney+ is a range of 230 million to 260 million paid subscribers by the end of its fiscal year 2024.<br />Even streaming pioneer  Netflix  hasn’t reached close to that level yet. And if you factor in Disney’s other streaming properties like Hulu and ESPN+, the company sees the full base of paid subscribers for its direct-to-consumer offerings hitting a range of 300 million to 350 million by September of 2024. Wall Street analysts currently expect Netflix’s global subscriber base to just be crossing the 300 million mark by that time, according to consensus projections tabulated by FactSet.<br />It is an ambitious goal, and hardly a sure thing, especially since both Disney and Netflix can chalk up a good deal of their recent success to the pandemic that has shuttered movie theaters, theme parks, restaurants and other entertainment options. Netflix has explicitly warned investors that much of its recent growth was likely pulled forward from future periods. And while Netflix is a streaming-only company, Disney made clear at a four-hour investor event Thursday that it is not throwing in the towel on theatrical movies. The company maintains plans to release big-budget movies next year and beyond from its properties including Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar and Disney.<br />But Disney now has a lot of ways to play both sides of the fence. The company previewed several shows and movies from its blockbuster franchises coming to Disney+. This includes a full Star Wars movie called “Andor” from Bourne movies screenwriter Tony Gilroy, coming in 2022. It also has several series coming from its Marvel universe, while its ownership of the old Twentieth Century Fox business and channels such as FX give the company plenty of material to appeal across audience types. The success of Disney+ gives the company options to stay flexible, contrasting with a recent move by  AT&T ’s  WarnerMedia division to move the full slate of its Warner Bros. theatrical movies targeted for next year to its HBO Max service, which has seen much lower adoption.</td>

      <td>Moderna, Pfizer now include children in trials, as health experts urge more such research to help curb transmission and reopen schools</td>
      <td>Pharmaceutical companies and health officials are homing in on a key sector of the population that has been largely left out of planning for Covid-19 vaccines: children.<br />Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  whose jointly developed vaccine is now being rolled out in the U.K., became the first Covid-19 vaccine developers to include children in U.S. trials in September.  Moderna Inc.,  whose vaccine has also shown to be effective in adults, said Thursday it began a trial for children 12 to 17 years old.  AstraZeneca  PLC also plans a U.S. trial for children.<br />The omission of children in U.S. vaccine trials so far worries public-health experts, who say they don’t know whether the vaccines are safe for children or need changes to dosage levels. While children are less likely than adults to fall gravely ill or die because of Covid-19, researchers say, vaccinating them will help prevent the spread of the virus and achieve herd immunity.<br />Yet some experts don’t expect a children’s vaccine will be ready by the 2021 school year because of how long trials take, even on the accelerated timeline for Covid-19 vaccines. “I’m pretty worried that the window’s closing if it hasn’t already closed,” said Evan Anderson, a pediatrics professor at the Emory University School of Medicine. “The timing then becomes a challenge in order to achieve enough data such that you’ve had a vaccine fully tested and evaluated over the spring and summer.”<br />The American Academy of Pediatrics recently sent a letter to federal officials urging children to be included in clinical studies. In the letter, AAP noted that more than two-thirds of the children who died from Covid-19 infections were Black or Latino.</td>

The charge of collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.<br />The police didn’t give further details, but a story in Mr. Lai’s newspaper, Apple Daily, said the charge was “reportedly based on Lai’s acceptance of interviews and calls for sanctions from foreign governments.”<br />Enforcement actions against pro-democracy figures have been accelerating in Hong Kong. In recent weeks, authorities expelled opposition lawmakers from the legislature and jailed prominent activists including Joshua Wong on crimes related to the mass protests that rocked Hong Kong last year.<br />On Monday, Hong Kong police arrested eight men related to a peaceful protest at a university this year, three of them on suspicion of national security crimes. On Tuesday, police arrested seven pro-democracy activists, including a former lawmaker, related to participation in a protest on July 1, the day after the national security law was imposed.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—For a year that started out with a share crash, a record loss and a global pandemic, 2020 is turning out to be very good for  SoftBank Group  Corp.<br />The Japanese technology investor, best known for its $100 billion Vision Fund and its mercurial chief executive, Masayoshi Son, this week scored an estimated $11 billion paper gain when U.S. food-delivery company  DoorDash Inc.  went public. It was the latest in a series of wins as soaring tech stocks pushed up the value of many of  SoftBank ’s  holdings.<br />Cashing in on another investment, SoftBank said Friday that it agreed to sell an 80% stake in Boston Dynamics, a company known for dog-like robots that can maneuver through rooms, to  Hyundai Motor Group .  The deal valued the robotics company at $1.1 billion. SoftBank has said more of its portfolio companies are poised to list or go on sale next year.<br />SoftBank’s share price has increased, too—around 9% this week alone and 66% this year. That puts this week’s stock level at its highest in 20 years, but still more than 20% below the bubble peak. The shares, which finished trading at 7,913 yen, equivalent to $76.04, on Friday, were pushed up by the overall market swell as well as a roughly $23 billion share-buyback program that is one of the world’s largest.<br />As of Friday, SoftBank has bought back around $14 billion of that total. The company is considering further buybacks that will lower the amount of shares outstanding and raise Mr. Son’s stake, said people with knowledge of the strategy. That in turn could make it easier for Mr. Son to realize a long-held idea of taking SoftBank private, they said.</td>

      <td>High prices will require capital discipline from the U.S. shale industry as well as a rebound in global demand</td>
      <td>Vaccines have buoyed hopes that oil demand will soon recover, and the Brent global benchmark is back above $50 a barrel. But traders may be underestimating the responsiveness of U.S. supply.<br />It has been a terrible year for the oil industry. A price war followed by a global pandemic forced many producers to slash spending on the search for new oil reserves. Historically, significant underinvestment in drilling has prompted a price spike when demand eventually rebounded, given the long lead time to find and develop new oil sources.<br />U.S. shale oil has changed that dynamic in recent years, though. The sector’s ability to ramp up production rapidly means the high prices that historically resulted from big cuts to capital expenditure no longer look to be such a sure thing. Also, the U.S. industry has for years frustrated efforts by Moscow and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase prices by cutting production, creating a glut. A recent proposal to add the main U.S. export price, WTI Midland, to the global oil benchmark from 2022 is a testament to shale oil’s importance in global supply.<br />True, shale producers have consolidated this year and come under investor pressure to focus on cash flow rather than growth. “The rules of the game have changed” and the industry no longer has access to the “incredible amounts of capital” it did just a year ago, says Benjamin Shattuck of energy consultant Wood Mackenzie.<br />Yet any newfound discipline may not last. Oil is up about a quarter since early November, when the first effective vaccine was announced. At the current U.S. benchmark price of just under $47, many reserves could be profitably lifted, particularly with today’s lower drilling costs. “As you move above $45 a barrel it gives you way more commercial drilling,” says Alisa Lukash of energy consultant Rystad Energy, referring to U.S. shale.</td>

      <td>With help from tech startups, the concept of timeshare vacation homes is shaking off its stodgy old image. Even commitment-phobes might be tempted.</td>
      <td>EARLIER THIS fall, Devin Florez, who lives in St. Louis, took his 8-year-old niece to Disney World. He felt safe heading to the park, he said, knowing both he and his niece would be masked, most of their time would be spent outdoors and they would be able to maintain social distancing. But with Covid-19 raging, he worried about booking nights at a hotel, where they’d encounter any number of other guests and staff. When first planning the trip, Mr. Florez, 34, began browsing  Airbnb s in Orlando, but costs were high. Then he saw a promo on the Points Guy, a blog focused on travel-club loyalty points, for $150 off bookings with Koala, a new platform that follows Airbnb’s model but allows individuals to rent one-time stays in timeshares that would otherwise sit unused.<br />Through Koala, Mr. Florez booked a week stay in a two-bedroom condo that put him within minutes of Disney World and came with amenities like a swimming pool and concierge. Thanks to the Points Guy promo, the cost was a mere $475, or about $68 a night.<br />Covid-19 has battered the travel industry. One-third of American hotels face potential bankruptcy. U.S. air traffic has stalled—in October, U.S. airlines carried 62% fewer passengers than the same month last year. But one sector of the industry continues to grow and is actually thriving in the face of the pandemic: the stodgy old timeshare industry.<br />Traditional timeshares—vacation rentals where ownership is split among several parties—took root in the 1960s. The Hilton Hale Kaanapali, a 253-room condo hotel on Maui, was among the first. Advertised as a “whale of a place to play,” it opened in 1966, with studios priced from $26,000 that could be booked for a maximum of 30 days a year. The timeshare model started popping up in all the usual vacation spots as eager developers lured potential buyers to sales presentations with free toasters and discount helicopter tours. The bait paid off. According to the American Resort Development Association (ARDA), there are currently more than 5,000 timeshare resorts in 121 countries.<br />In early 2020, fear and lockdowns kept customers away from traditional hotels and rental properties. But because timeshares are like second homes for their owners, they didn’t experience the same extreme drop-off, even at the height of coronavirus lockdowns in spring 2020. “Once regulations began to be lifted in July, some places saw occupancies of 100%,” said Jason Gamel, president and CEO of the ARDA.</td>

Although the company reduced its overall investment budget this year to save cash, digital’s share of the spending doubled to roughly 25%.<br />Boundaries between store and website sales also blurred in new ways this year. With boutiques closed, shop assistants resorted to contacting customers through messaging apps or arranged digital consultations to drive business. Gucci’s parent company, Kering, expects these so-called “distance sales” to stick. In the future, store workers may log on during quiet times and interact with online shoppers to improve the low sales conversion rates that afflict many luxury-brand websites.</td>

      <td>Even before a pandemic sapped the world’s thirst for crude, fossil-fuel producers faced threats from renewable energy, electric vehicles and worries about climate change. Is now the time to strike, or slip away?</td>
      <td>Does investing in oil and gas companies still make sense? Money manager Jacinto Hernandez has doubts.<br />The partner at Capital Group Cos. liquidated $1 billion in oil and gas stocks as Covid-19 spread around the globe in February, according to regulatory filings. Mr. Hernandez said he suspected the new coronavirus was about to crush global demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel—and with it, any near-term thesis for investing in oil companies.<br />Adam Waterous, a Canadian private-equity investor, looked at the same circumstances and came to the opposite conclusion: This was the time to buy. Demand will eventually bounce back, he said, and when it does, prices will spike sometime later this decade. He backed up that conviction in July when his Waterous Energy Fund purchased a big stake in an oil sands company.<br />“There is absolutely a stigma about investing in oil and gas,” Mr. Waterous said. “It hasn’t been a sexy industry for a while.”<br />The question of whether to invest in oil and gas has become a polarizing issue in the world of money management. Even before the pandemic sapped the world’s thirst for fuel, the future of the fossil-fuel industry was already under threat due to the rise of electric cars, the proliferation of renewable energy and growing consciousness about the long-term impact of climate change.</td>

      <td>Proposal would add accountability, transparency to process by having constituents work with lawmakers to apply for ‘community-focused grants’</td>
      <td>A BIPARTISAN GROUP of lawmakers makes a push to bring back a form of earmarks—lawmakers’ ability to direct federal funding to specific projects —but with more transparency and accountability. The 12 members of the bipartisan House Select Committee on Modernization, a group responsible for updating how Congress operates, are pushing to start a program of “community-focused grants,” which they hope would help restore Congress’s role in making specific decisions about spending taxpayer money.<br />“We laid out a framework that we thought could avoid some of the abuse of the past,” the group’s chairman, Washington Democratic Rep. Derek Kilmer told The Wall Street Journal’s Kristina Peterson. Under the proposal, local communities would work with their members of Congress to apply for a grant through a public database. If approved through the appropriations process, the funds would be subject to congressional oversight and could even be clawed back if lawmakers deemed they were being abused.<br />“It has to be uniquely derived from a local community,” said committee vice chairman Rep. Tom Graves (R., Ga.). For-profit entities wouldn’t be eligible to apply. “The member now becomes more of an advocate for or a shepherd for something that’s important to a local community.” The House banned earmarks in 2011, after the GOP won the majority in Nov. 2010.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) has spoken in favor of restoring some form of earmarks, but it’s not clear how receptive GOP leaders would be in the House or Senate. “Earmarks cause members to vote for excessively expensive spending bills that cost tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in exchange for a few earmarks worth a few million or sometimes just thousands of dollars,” says the Citizens Against Government Waste, an influential conservative group.<br />MAKE FOUNDATIONS SPEND? A coalition of progressive multimillionaires, foundation heads, think tanks, and donor-advised fund managers is calling on Congress and the incoming Biden administration to make a temporary change to tax law to make private foundations give away more of their money  if they want to qualify for tax deductions. They urge the Biden administration and Congress to double the minimum required disbursement by private foundations, set by the Internal Revenue Service. Foundations are now required to pay out 5% of their endowment each year; the letter calls for raising it to 10% for the next three years to raise around $200 billion for struggling charities, without the use of taxpayer funds.</td>

Though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidance on which Americans should be first in line for the initial doses, state governors have the final say—meaning the makeup of the priority line could vary widely by state.<br />Front-line health workers and residents of long-term care facilities are expected to get the first batch of shots, which could come within days pending emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration.<br />Businesses are focusing on where their workers rank in the subsequent wave of recipients, referred to in the federal rollout plan as group “1B.” That group includes essential workers needed to maintain basic services and spans professions as diverse as grocery-store cashiers, bus drivers, teachers and utility workers.<br />The chief executives of Cargill Inc., Smithfield Foods Inc. and Perdue Farms Inc. have said in recent weeks that food workers merit priority for vaccines. Meat-industry groups called on governors this week to give priority to meatpacking workers to help safeguard the U.S. food supply.

The EU compromise stopped short of adopting broader economic sanctions requested by some of its member countries.<br />The U.S. is also expected to impose sanctions on Turkish entities, in this case in response to Ankara’s acquisition of the advanced S-400 Russian-made air-defense system, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />U.S. officials are expected to roll out the sanctions Friday under a 2017 U.S. law for procuring weapons from a blacklisted supplier, the person said. The State Department reiterated its policy of declining to comment on future sanctions.<br />Despite pressure from some lawmakers, the Trump administration had held back on sanctions over the missile system, although President Trump said last year the U.S. would withhold sales of advanced F-35 stealth jet fighters to Turkey.</td>

Hunter Biden is implicated in that investigation but was never a specific target for criminal prosecution, the people said.

      <td>Facebook ’s  motto in its early days was to “move fast and break things.” That’s also one way to describe the Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Facebook that was seconded this week by 46 state Attorneys General. That so many lawyers could come up with such a weak legal case is remarkable.<br />CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t have many political friends these days in either party. He has been criticized for restricting speech on his platform both too much and too little. Facebook has helped to destroy the advertising market for newspapers, and the world might be better off without it.<br />But the purpose of U.S. antitrust law isn’t to remedy social or political problems. That’s essentially what the FTC on a 3-2 vote and the AGs are seeking with their lawsuits that asks courts to force Facebook to divest its Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014) acquisitions.<br />According to the FTC complaint, Mr. Zuckerberg sought to buy Instagram and WhatsApp to neutralize competition. Well, sure. “It is better to buy than compete,” Mr. Zuckerberg emailed in 2008. Any business must adapt as technology and consumer tastes change. Mr. Zuckerberg saw how smart phones increased photo sharing and private instant messaging.<br />It was less expensive and easier for Facebook to acquire apps than build copycats. But bigger companies buy upstarts all the time. Note also that Instagram and WhatsApp were complementary apps to Facebook, not direct competitors. Many people use parallel social-media platforms with distinct features such as TikTok,  Twitter ,   Pinterest ,  Reddit and Snap.</td>

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), who famously supported the boycott of Goya Foods earlier this year after CEO Robert Unanue visited the Trump White House as part of a Hispanic Prosperity Initiative.<br />Mr. Unanue broke the news Monday during an interview with “The Michael Berry Show.” “When she boycotted us, our sales actually increased 1,000%,” Mr. Unanue said. “So we gave her an honorary. We never were able to hand it to her, but she got employee of the month for bringing attention to Goya and our adobo.”<br />Ms. Ocasio-Cortez now denies that she ever called for a boycott, tweeting that all she did was tweet about learning to make her own adobo, and that any suggestion otherwise is a matter of Fox News indulging in “their made up fantasies.” Adobo happens to be one of Goya’s most popular seasonings and her search for an alternative came in the thick of the boycott calls. CNN reported at the time that “Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet that she’d boycott Goya.”<br />We’re glad that Mr. Unanue, who pointed out he’d participated in similar initiatives for Barack and Michelle Obama, never backed down and his company wasn’t harmed. Maybe the Congresswoman needs a better sense of humor.</td>

      <td>Can a state be harmed by the way other states conduct their elections?</td>
      <td>Ken Paxton, the Texas Attorney General, seems intent on developing a name for himself as the patron saint of lost legal causes. He’s the father of the recent and long-shot case against ObamaCare, and this week he launched another implausible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn state presidential election results.<br />In Texas v. Pennsylvania, Mr. Paxton, joined by 17 other states and President Trump, claims that four states have harmed Texas by violating their election laws in ways that poisoned the result. He wants the Court to take the case directly, in “original jurisdiction,” and order the legislatures in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia to overturn election certifications for Joe Biden.<br />The Court asked the four states to reply by 3 p.m. Thursday, but it would be a legal and political earthquake if the Court took the case. Cases of original jurisdiction—when a state bypasses lower courts and goes directly to the Supreme Court—are rare and typically involve interstate disputes. This one concerns election law in states other than Texas.<br />The first issue is whether Texas has the legal standing to sue. To have standing, a plaintiff must point to a specific injury and there must be some possibility of a remedy. In this case, what is the injury? No one is interfering with Texas’s authority to deliver its Electoral College votes.<br />Mr. Paxton argues that the four states have harmed his state and violated the Electors Clause of the Constitution by holding elections with major procedural irregularities. He’s saying Texas can be harmed by the way another state manages its elections. But if Texas can sue on these grounds, then some unhappy state will sue another state after every close election whose outcome it doesn’t like.</td>

      <td>So Hunter Biden’s business is news after all. Who knew? Well, the New York Post did, and so did we and a few others.<br />But in October when the Post broke the story of an email, allegedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop, referring to a meeting he’d arranged between his father and an executive from a Ukrainian energy company, Democrats and most of the press told Americans it was Russian disinformation. The story was banned on  Twitter .  But with the election over, presto, even CNN’s Jake Tapper is a born-again bloodhound.<br />That is itself a scandal. When the younger Mr. Biden’s business relationships first surfaced—e.g., his highly paid position on the Burisma corporate board, despite no background in Ukraine or energy—it should have provoked serious reporting. Instead, the people who spent years claiming Donald Trump was a Russian agent ignored much stronger evidence that the younger Mr. Biden had been getting rich on his father’s name. He sometimes traveled to business meetings as a tag-along with his Vice President dad on Air Force II.<br />These latest reports are no surprise to Sens. Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley, the chairmen of investigating Senate committees. In September they released a joint report detailing some of Hunter’s million-dollar dealings with politically connected foreigners. The report said they raised “serious counterintelligence and extortion concerns relating to Hunter Biden and his family.”<br />The press yawned. One who did not was our Kimberley Strassel. On Oct. 22 she wrote a column headlined “The Biden ‘Family Legacy,’” based on email and texts between Hunter and business partner Tony Bobulinski that suggest Joe Biden’s son knew exactly what he was cashing in on. At one point he reminded Mr. Bobulinksi that the heads of CEFC China Energy, a Shanghai-based conglomerate closely entwined with the Chinese government, are “coming to be MY partner to be partners with the Bidens.”</td>

The retailer’s e-commerce sales jumped 86% in the quarter.<br />Big-box retailers including  Walmart Inc.  and  Target Corp.  have generally fared well amid the coronavirus crisis, offering pandemic-weary shoppers one-stop shopping and in some cases, easy buy online, pick up in store parking lot options.<br />Costco’s shoppers, who pay a membership fee to shop, are spending less on travel and eating out during the pandemic and more on food, appliances, homegoods and other items, said finance chief Richard Galanti on a call with analysts Thursday. “They seem to have redirected some of those dollars,” he said.<br />Profit also rose during the quarter to $1.17 billion, up from $844 million in the same period last year. Costco raised wages during the quarter due to Covid-19, adding about $212 million in costs for the period, said Mr. Galanti. But the company boosted profits elsewhere, for example selling more food by reducing spoilage, he said. Costco has extended premium wages through January, he said.</td>

      <td>The sweeping government antitrust lawsuits against  Facebook Inc.  laid down a new bipartisan marker for enforcement after years of hesitancy, but they will be tested by a federal court system that has proved skeptical of broad antitrust intervention.<br />The lawsuits, filed Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission and 46 states, allege the social-media giant illegally preserved a social-networking monopoly through a years-long campaign of freezing out potential rivals and buying nascent competitors such Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook vowed a vigorous court battle, saying its acquisitions made those apps better. It accused the government of attempting to rewrite history.<br />The cases come amid a national debate about whether a handful of tech companies have become too dominant—and whether antitrust enforcers should have done more to police powerful firms and concentrated industries. Criticism of the FTC and Justice Department, which share antitrust authority, has come from Democrats and Republicans alike.<br />The agencies, however, can’t impose their will by fiat, and must instead prove their cases in court. With the current calls for more enforcement, the DOJ and FTC have shown more willingness to test those waters. Weeks before the Facebook suit, the Justice Department and 11 states brought an antitrust case against Google. More states may join soon with additional claims against the search giant.<br />The last few years, however, also showed the pitfalls antitrust enforcers face with the courts, which have become more conservative and have weakened antitrust precedents in recent decades. In August, a federal appeals court ruled the FTC didn’t prove that  Qualcomm Inc.  unlawfully preserved a monopoly in cellphone chips. A New York federal judge in February rejected a bid by a group of state attorneys general to block  T-Mobile US Inc.’s  takeover of Sprint Corp.</td>

But there’s a way to make use of the good news to speed up herd immunity.<br />The bad news is that in July the U.S. passed up an opportunity to secure by June 2021 more than 100 million doses of the  Pfizer  vaccine, now expected to receive emergency-use authorization in the next few days. Instead, officials followed a balanced-portfolio strategy that reserved as many as 300 million doses of the  AstraZeneca  vaccine, whose prospects are unclear.<br />The good news is that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines performed at the upper end of expectations, with 95% efficacy after two doses. And intriguingly, Pfizer’s submission to the Food and Drug Administration shows that the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing disease had largely kicked in by two weeks after the first dose, and there was no dramatic increase in efficacy after the booster was given three weeks later.<br />The protocol in Pfizer’s clinical trial was to give all participants two doses. The FDA is likely to approve this protocol, and standard procedure is to prescribe a drug according to protocol. But we are in a pandemic and supplies of vaccine are inadequate. There’s an alternative: vaccinating as many people as possible with a first dose and waiting on the booster until supplies are plentiful.<br />The Pfizer study wasn’t designed to put a number on first-dose efficacy, but the data in Pfizer’s “cumulative incidence curves” suggest at least 75% efficacy for two weeks after one dose. The question is whether to use the 100 million doses on 50 million people, of whom two doses would protect roughly 47.5 million, or to give one dose each to 100 million people and protect at least 75 million.</td>

That cold winter of 2013 witnessed the largely undisturbed departure of thousands of American and allied troops from Afghanistan’s deadliest province. In the end, the Taliban chose to keep most of their powder dry, conserving resources to fight their fellow Afghans rather than sacrificing fighters in high-profile but tactically meaningless attacks against departing foreigners.<br />In the rest of Afghanistan, whenever American troops finally do depart for home, a similar scenario is likely to play out. Yet President Trump’s decision to commence a new Afghanistan troop drawdown has prompted bipartisan outrage. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth raised the specter of more “Americans in body bags,” while Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio invoked the chaos of Saigon in 1975. Retired generals and journalists added their voices to the chorus, condemning this supposedly precipitous withdrawal. But our own experience suggests that this consternation is overblown.<br />Mr. Trump’s troop drawdown may well be politically motivated, but it also reflects a realistic appraisal of the facts on the ground. The Taliban are increasingly ascendant on the battlefield; they now control or contest nearly half the country. Civilian casualties in October were the highest in more than a year. Continued civil war is likely to be the next chapter of Afghanistan’s story, whether U.S. forces stay or leave.</td>

      <td>Advent and Epiphany are also holy days. Why not call them all what they are?</td>
      <td>The season of good tidings often brings an awkward moment. It has happened in the checkout line, on a phone call, during a quick conversation with a neighbor. I’ll say, “Merry Christmas.” The other person will respond, “Happy holidays.” Tranquility turns to tension. A simple exchange of well wishes ends uncomfortably.<br />But this year will be different. I’m going to say “happy holidays”—not only in response to others but as my default December greeting. Far from being an effort to avoid religious language, I’ve come to understand that the phrase is inherently religious and respectful.<br />Many of the evangelical Christians I grew up with, and the Catholics whom I have since joined, feel hesitant about “happy holidays.” Sometimes that hesitation becomes outright hostility. This attitude comes from the justifiable fear that Judeo-Christian traditions and cultural trappings are being swept away by a secular tide. Language has the power to shape what we believe and think, the argument goes, so abandoning the word “Christmas” speaks to a broader abolition of the Christian faith in the public square.<br />There’s no doubt that secularism is rising, and plenty of Americans say “happy holidays” to steer clear of religion, although many others use it to be inclusive of other religious traditions, including Hanukkah.<br />Yet those two words can’t be divorced from the reality of the Christmas season. Drawn from Old English, the word holiday is a combination of “holy” and “day.” It is an unwitting acknowledgment that this is, in fact, a transcendent season. As far as season’s greetings go, the phrase seems warm and true and perfectly apt.</td>

      <td>A British neurologist explores his passionate identiﬁcation with the reckless adventurer Percy Harrison Fawcett.</td>
      <td>Like the late Oliver Sacks, Andrew Lees is a British neurologist who is also a talented writer of memoir, medical reportage and travelogue. Like Sacks, who died in 2015 at 82, Dr. Lees has made personal eccentricity into something of a cottage industry. A sense of oddness informs Dr. Lees’s books, perhaps even more so than those of Sacks, whose signature volumes, such as “Awakenings” and “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,” at least tempered their strange sensibility with mass-market appeal.<br />But the chief lure of Dr. Lees’s books—and their abiding complication—is that they defy easy classification. This was surely true of “Mentored by a Madman,” a 2017 account of how the drug-addled beat poet William Burroughs shaped Dr. Lees’s research into Parkinson’s disease. It’s equally the case with “Brazil That Never Was,” which chronicles his obsession with the vanished British explorer Percy Harrison Fawcett.<br />Fawcett disappeared in 1925 while searching for a legendary lost city along the Amazon. His exploits were the subject of David Grann’s popular 2009 biography “The Lost City of Z,” which was adapted into a 2016 film. But it was an earlier book about Fawcett that first got Dr. Lees’s attention.<br />After Fawcett’s disappearance, his son Brian, hoping to keep his father’s flame alive, published “Exploration Fawcett” (1953), billed as a collection of the explorer’s own writings about his previous adventures. Dr. Lees wonders to what degree Brian Fawcett had a hand in shaping the text, which seemed to anticipate Indiana Jones in its vivid depictions of danger narrowly escaped in exotic locales.<br />Whatever the provenance of “Exploration Fawcett,” it became a seminal scripture of Dr. Lees’s childhood as he grew up in the West Riding of Yorkshire in the 1950s. After Dr. Lees’s father recommended to him a library copy of the book, the young boy was hooked. “Fawcett challenged me to travel with him to intangible worlds,” Dr. Lees recalls, “where everything was connected to everything else and the unfathomable was within reach . . . The evenings that I spent reading Exploration Fawcett were as alive as any I can now remember. It was as if the book had chosen me, rather than the other way round.”</td>

      <td>A diagnosis of entitlement culture, the story of populist radio and more of the year’s standouts.</td>
      <td>Christopher Caldwell’s “The Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties” (Simon and Schuster, 352 pages, $28) appeared in January, before the George Floyd riots or the coronavirus panic, but a careful reader of this penetrating study of postwar America might have foreseen the reckless lunacy occasioned by both events. Mr. Caldwell contends that, with the passage and signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the nation’s leaders established a new de facto constitution under which the purpose of politics was to remake civil society according to enlightened theories of racial justice. American leaders set about erecting enormously powerful and cripplingly expensive government agencies and programs to guarantee a state of racial equality. When their efforts failed, their successors created more such agencies and programs, and cultivated the destructive social convention known as political correctness to punish dissenters.<br />Both Republican and Democratic leaders, Mr. Caldwell contends, believed they could spend endless billions on a doomed enterprise and accrue no societal cost; they were bound, or “entitled,” to succeed. Over the past several months we’ve seen American elites blame the cops for a half-century of their own policies’ failure and shut down the bulk of the private-sector economy as if the government doesn’t need it to make everything run. The Age of Entitlement is still very much in progress.<br />America’s wealthy and educated classes come in for another condign drubbing in Michael Lind’s “The New Class War: Saving Democracy From the Managerial Elite” (Portfolio, 203 pages, $25). Mr. Lind is far, I believe, from being a Marxist, but his account of 2016’s populist revolt feels to me like economic determinism. What makes his book work so brilliantly, though, isn’t so much his economic interpretation of our political quandary as his acid analysis of “technocratic neoliberalism.” One salient component of that worldview, Mr. Lind writes in a passage I particularly relished, “is to medicalize politics and treat differing viewpoints as evidence of mental and emotional disorders.” Hence the “phobia” suffix: Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia and so on. This habit of mind he finds as far back as Richard Hofstadter’s 1964 essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” surely among the most overrated and malign political compositions of the 20th century.<br />Was there ever a time when comity and reasonableness prevailed? Well, perhaps; but as Paul Matzko reminds us in “The Radio Right: How a Band of Broadcasters Took on the Federal Government and Built the Modern Conservative Movement” (Oxford, 304 pages, $34.95), distrust and acrimony were always part of American politics, too. The birth of modern American conservatism is usually attributed to William F. Buckley Jr., Frank Meyer and other midcentury intellectuals; Mr. Matzko insists that it began with a band of anticommunist and fundamentalist radio broadcasters in the 1940s and ’50s. In the ’60s radio personalities such as Carl McIntire and Billy James Hargis began delivering daily invectives against President John F. Kennedy’s Soviet policies to millions of listeners. That led the president and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, to seek a means of retaliation, which they found in a plan drawn up by a pair of communist-sympathizing labor leaders, Victor and Walter Reuther.<br />Not only did the Kennedy brothers implement a scheme of government-empowered intimidation against their critics; the National Council of Churches got in on the bullying, too. “The Radio Right” is an impressively researched and lucidly written work of scholarship.</td>

      <td>From picture-book travels to fantastic adventures, a treasure-filled year of reading.</td>
      <td>Four of the year’s best picture books have waterways—real, metaphorical, man-made—that wind through them, taking young readers on empathetic journeys of imagination. In “Birrarung Wilam” (Candlewick, 40 pages, $17.99), the waterway is a real one, Australia’s Yarra River, which gathers itself from tributaries far inland and runs through the city of Melbourne to the sea. The text of this exceptional book, by Aunty Joy Murphy and Andrew Kelly, has an incantatory magic, mingling English and the Aboriginal language of Woiwurrung: “As ngua rises, turning clouds over the distant city red . . . Birrarung begins its long winding path down to palem warreen.” What do all these words mean? Children will be able to guess from what they see in Lisa Kennedy’s evocative and rough-feeling paintings (see above). They can also check the glossary at the back. This is a marvel for reading aloud, a dreamlike sojourn through a distinctive riverine ecology.<br />The chattering, churning, whirling waters of Jordan Scott’s autobiographical picture book “I Talk Like a River” (Holiday House, 40 pages, $18.99) exist both inside and outside its young narrator, a boy who suffers from a debilitating stutter. “At school, I hide in the back of the class. I hope I don’t have to talk,” he tells us. “When my teacher asks me a question, all my classmates turn and look.” In sublime and poignant paintings, Sydney Smith shows the child’s struggle, his misery and shame—and then the glorious, sun-dappled afternoon when his father uses an example from nature to transform the boy’s understanding of himself: “I talk like a river.”<br />With enigmatic black-and-white illustrations, “The Wanderer” (Levine Querido, 96 pages, $21.99) takes readers on a gorgeous, wordless odyssey from one side of the world to another. Peter Van den Ende’s intricate drawings follow a little paper boat as it travels through oceans and seas teeming with wonders: undulating monsters, playful mermen, and aquatic creatures that resemble elephants, cheetahs and medieval jesters. Wandering, the vessel moves beneath starry skies, passing ice floes and oil rigs until, at last, it enters the waters of a moonlit canal, where a mysterious passenger disembarks. Given the absence of text, the book may seem accessible to readers of any age, but its sophistication makes it best suited to those over the age of 8.<br />Rivers unfurl like pretty ribbons across distant landscapes in “If You Come to Earth” (Chronicle, 80 pages, $18.99), a beautiful and quirky picture book by Sophie Blackall that’s styled as a child’s letter to a visitor from outer space. “There are more than seven billion people on Earth,” the narrator explains. “You can’t see our thoughts, but sometimes we show our feelings on our faces.” The illustrations for these musings have all the humor and delicacy that make Ms. Blackall’s work so distinctive (see left): wry lines and marzipan hues in tableaux that abound in seek-and-find interest. With an innocent as narrator—“Some things are part of nature. Some things are made by people”—this open-hearted book exalts the commonplace, making ordinary things seem remarkable.<br />Rivers aren’t a big feature of the year’s best illustrated chapter books, but water, ice and snow do figure in “The Silver Arrow” (Little, Brown, 259 pages, $16.99), a sparkling fantasy adventure story by Lev Grossman, with pictures by Tracy Nishamura Bishop. When an 11-year-old girl receives the gift of a steam locomotive, she and her little brother soon find themselves thundering into the magical unknown. Become conductors, they acquire train carriages—some filled with books, some with candy—and punch the tickets of chatty animal passengers.  Jaunty and wise, “The Silver Arrow” makes for a particularly fine read-aloud.</td>

      <td>From far-flung worlds to an eerie setting close to home, our columnist picks this year’s stellar reading.</td>
      <td>For sci-fi fans of a certain age, nothing was more welcome in 2020 than Eric Flint and Dave Freer’s “The Shaman of Karres” (Baen, 292 pages, $25), the third sequel to James H. Schmitz’s “The Witches of Karres,” now 70 years old and still a candidate for the best space-opera ever. “Shaman” follows the adventures of the Leewit, the youngest of the witches, whirling through space with hapless Captain Pausert on the trail of a new alien threat, one worse than the Megair Cannibals or the nanite menace. This time it’s a strange creature with powers of mind control, so insidious the controlled don’t even notice. Pure fun from the past, with just a touch of satire, all updated and with added invention. Who can resist the Daal of Uldune, a six-clone hexaperson, who is also a ruthless tyrant trying to go straight? Until, that is, his chivalrous instincts are stimulated and the gloves come off.<br />Nostalgia of a different kind is invoked by Christina Henry’s “The Ghost Tree” (Berkley, 432 pages, $16). No star-jaunting here, instead the scenario is what Ray Bradbury used to call “October country”: midwest, small town, scent of leaves burning, perfect peace. But there’s a chill in the air, Halloween is coming on and the town has closed ranks around a deadly secret. Just like the faeries of ancient folktale, the inhabitants pay an annual toll of sacrifice, and no one must speak of it. Memory of the missing is wiped out—except in 14-year old Lauren, a prime target for whatever hides in the ghost tree. It’s grimmer than Grimm, with teenage angst and rebellion included.<br />Christopher Paolini’s “To Sleep in a Sea of Stars” (Tor, 878 pages, $29.99) is quite unaffected by the weight of the past. Mr. Paolini cares nothing for the impossibility of faster-than-light travel, and has a unified field theory to back him up. But if you venture to the stars, you must be ready for First Contact, and then First Combat, and then it’s Star Wars, with the Jellies and the Nightmares and the Old Ones all mixing in. Further complexity comes from the heroine Kira, who is no longer just human now that she’s made contact with an alien mind. Mr. Paolini develops his ideas outside the story in a number of appendices. Sci-fi has always loved what some call “paratext”: future histories and fake quotations tucked in around the sides so you can get information across without putting a drag on the story. Mr. Paolini has so many ideas, that’s what he has to do.<br />Star-hopping is great, but, realists will object, we haven’t so much as got a colony on the Moon yet. And, sci-fi fans will chorus, we darned well should have by now! In “The Relentless Moon” (Tor, 542 pages, $17.99), Mary Robinette Kowal imagines a world where we did indeed try a bit harder over the last 50 years, and did what we could have done. If, that is, we’d had the kick in the pants delivered by a major asteroid impact in Chesapeake Bay. Maybe that would have made us realize that here on Earth we’re living in a giant pinball game. So we could have trained some female astronauts, given NASA some common sense and taken care of the politics at home as well as the tech in space. Not that the tech is not a problem, as Ms. Kowal shows in this truly relentless exposition of how to promote, and also sabotage, the best-planned of lunar initiatives.<br />Heroic fantasy may be the favored genre these days, but urban fantasy still has a lot going for it. Richard Kadrey’s “Ballistic Kiss” (Harper Voyager, 349 pages, $28.99) continues the adventures of “Sandman Slim,” a private investigator of the supernatural, based in Los Angeles. In previous volumes Slim has served his time in Hell and even acted as a stand-in for Lucifer. But as he points out, surviving Hell is one thing, L.A. is another.</td>

      <td>Cara Black has earned a loyal following with her series starring Parisian investigator Aimée Leduc. This year, Ms. Black showed a new facet of her talent with the historical thriller “Three Hours in Paris” (Soho Crime 348 pages, $27.95). It’s the ticking-clock saga of Kate Rees, a sharpshooting American war widow trained by the British and smuggled into Paris in 1940 to assassinate the leader of Nazi Germany. The reader assumes Kate will miss her shot at Adolf Hitler—this is not alternative history—but what surprises is what comes next. Kate makes contact with Resistance operatives in a race to elude a German policeman tasked by the Führer himself with her swift capture.<br />“The Bramble and the Rose” (Norton, 198 pages, $25.95) is Tom Bouman’s third novel featuring rural Pennsylvania police officer Henry Farrell. An introspective loner, Henry approaches a personal and emotional epiphany after learning of a grisly crime: a headless corpse found in a forest. Was the victim, an out-of-town private eye, killed by a bear or a man? And what brought the victim to this neck of the woods? Henry teams up with Mary Weaver, a biologist, to hunt for a rogue animal who may or may not have acquired a taste for human flesh. “A man-killer isn’t stupid,” she explain. “It stalks its prey in absolute silence. . . . Most survivors never hear or see it . . . until it’s less than fifty feet away. And if it has a taste for man, harsh words won’t stop him.”<br />Cormoran Strike, the detective hero of an enjoyable series of books by Robert Galbraith (a pen name for J.K. Rowling), has his most complex adventure yet in “Troubled Blood” (Mulholland, 933 pages, $29). This hefty volume is stuffed with intrigue, surprise, action, violence, social comedy and romance: “value for money,” as the British say. It starts with a cold case: the disappearance some 40 years ago of a doctor whose daughter still wants to learn what happened. “The truth’s out there,” Strike promises. But time, fate and other folk seem to conspire against Strike and his business partner, Robin Ellacott. The ongoing dramas in the two investigators’ own families also threaten to lead them astray. But our pseudonymous author sorts everything out by the end with the skill of a world-class storyteller.<br />A cellphone swiped from a lawyer striding through New York’s Grand Central Terminal triggers the infernal plot-machine of Patrick Hoffman’s “Clean Hands” (Atlantic Monthly, 280 pages, $26). The phone is loaded with confidential information pertaining to a high-profile lawsuit between two banks. Getting the phone back is vital. But was the theft genuine? The lawyer’s boss calls on Valencia Walker, an ex-CIA case officer, to put out the blaze, but the blaze keeps spreading. Street-level crooks lead to smalltime hoods who point to bigger gangsters—all the way up the criminal food-chain to where everything must converge. “It just seems,” Valencia finally says, “like this might be one where it would be better if everybody would just stand down.” But is it too late for that?<br />Joe Ide’s novels about Isaiah “IQ” Quintabe, a young private investigator in East Long Beach, Calif., are among the most inventive and smartly written books in the genre. “Hi Five” (Mulholland, 341 pages, $27), IQ’s fourth case, is his most unpredictable yet. An illicit arms dealer hires him, under threat of breaking his violinist girlfriend’s fingers, to solve the murder of the crook’s daughter’s boyfriend, a killing for which the daughter stands accused. Complicating matters further, the daughter is a multiple personality; IQ must prove each of the defendant’s five “alters” innocent to save his girlfriend’s digits. All in a week’s work for this Holmesian avatar in a gritty Southern California suburb.</td>

      <td>The impulse to constantly check phone screens for bad news only got its name in the last few years</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />Of all the words that came to prominence in 2020, one that truly seems to capture the zeitgeist of our dreary times is “doomscrolling.”<br />If you’ve spent any time on social media this year, you know the feeling. As Wall Street Journal Personal Tech columnist Nicole Nguyendefined it back in June, “doomscrolling” refers to “spending inordinate amounts of time on devices poring over grim news.” The phenomenon became all too common when the coronavirus pandemic kept people cooped up, as so many of us obsessed over the endless stream of depressing updates.<br />Despite the pessimism that the word encapsulates, “doomscrolling” is a lexical success story. By year’s end, it merited mention in a report from Oxford Languages, the publisher of the Oxford English Dictionary, on how the pandemic has profoundly shaped the lexicon. “Doomscrolling,” the report said, “typified the realities of the new normal” and “expressed poignantly the language changes brought on by the pandemic.”<br />The portentous sound of the word may have heightened its impact, drawing on centuries-old connotations of the word “doom.” Derived from Old English “dom” meaning “judgment,” it has long fused with other words to make compounds like “doomsday” for the final reckoning in the Judeo-Christian tradition. In the mid-20th century, “doomsayer” emerged as a bleaker version of “soothsayer,” for one who predicts calamities. “Doomsaying” may have provided a kind of model for both “doomscrolling” and a related neologism, “doomsurfing.”</td>

Yet a breakup would also be complex, requiring potentially years of engineering work on top of legal wrangling.<br />Months before the FTC suit, Facebook called divestment of the apps “a complete nonstarter” in a briefing document, saying that disentangling them would result in diminished products, weaker security for user data and billions of dollars in redundant spending.<br />In a memo sent to employees on Wednesday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the lawsuits would take years to play out, and said he believed the company would prevail in court.</td>

      <td>The Safra brothers built up banks in Latin America, New York and Switzerland that catered discreetly to ultrarich clients</td>
      <td>SÃO PAULO—Joseph Safra, a Lebanese-Brazilian billionaire who built an international financial empire and financed a hostile takeover of Chiquita Brands International that took the business world by surprise, died Thursday here in Brazil’s business capital. He was 82.<br />Mr. Safra, ranked by Forbes as Brazil’s richest man with an estimated net worth of $23.2 billion, died of natural causes at the Albert Einstein Hospital, according to Banco Safra, the bank he made into one of Latin America’s most prominent. He was heir to a banking empire that began financing camel caravans in the Middle East and grew into a transnational business that includes banking, bananas, real estate and other interests.<br />His banking influence spanned from Latin America’s largest economy to the U.S. and Europe. Though he was reserved and shunned the spotlight, Mr. Safra and his brothers, Edmond and Moise, were well known for having built up the Banco Safra, the Safra National Bank of New York and the J. Safra Sarasin Bank in Switzerland by catering to ultrarich clients and elite companies. Though discreet, the Safra family is credited with helping shape global banking.<br />“He was a great banker, a true entrepreneur who built the Safra Group in the world, achieving success for his seriousness and business vision,” a statement from the Safra Group, the financial conglomerate he controlled, said. “He was a great leader and very respected inside and outside the organization.”<br />Mr. Safra arrived in Brazil in his 20s, brought here with his brothers from Lebanon by his father, Jacob, who had opened a bank in Beirut. The arrival of the Sephardic-Jewish family came in the wake of World War II, at a time when Israel had been founded and persecution of Beirut’s Jews had flared.</td>

      <td>Warehouse fire ignited a cache of explosive ammonium nitrate, authorities say, leading to more than two dozen arrests but no ministers among them</td>
      <td>Nearly 200 people were killed and more than 6,000 injured in a massive explosion at the port in Beirut on Aug. 4, ravaging the heart of residential areas and the city’s vibrant commercial district. Dozens of people are unaccounted for. Here is what we know so far.<br />A giant explosion at a warehouse in the port sent a shock wave through east and downtown Beirut at about 6 p.m. local time on Aug. 4. Videos of the blast posted on social media showed smoke billowing from the warehouse on the waterfront before a massive explosion produced a dome-shaped cloud that engulfed large parts of central Beirut. The force of the blast did tremendous damage to the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby buildings. The homes of tens of thousands of people were damaged by the blast.<br />Authorities say the blast occurred when a fire at a warehouse—Hangar 12—on the city’s waterfront ignited a cache of ammonium nitrate, an explosive material that had been stored at the site for more than six years.<br />Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound most commonly used in fertilizers. It is also used to make explosives and was used in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.<br />The Lebanese government is facing questions about why the explosive chemicals were stored at the port. A judge leading an investigation into the blast has charged caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab and three former ministers with negligence in relation to the blast. Mr. Diab has denied any wrongdoing. The former ministers couldn’t be reached for comment. Many Lebanese blame years of poor governance and corruption by the entire ruling elite for the explosion.</td>

      <td>Bobby Jindal is correct in “Can GOP Find Its Way on Health Care?” (op-ed, Dec. 3). The goal of a Republican plan should be to provide any person who is sick or injured with the appropriate care in the appropriate setting at the appropriate time in the management of any illness or injury, with emphasis on preventing illness or injury whenever possible. This will take away the one central issue on which the Democrats have held the advantage, access to care.<br />Republicans favor a market solution to the vexing problem of health-care system reform but have been unable to articulate a simple, easily understandable vision to implement that solution.<br />The solution should be based on three principles:<br />1) Expand the choices. There are many different, imperfect ways to finance care and many different, imperfect ways to deliver care. Each has advantages and disadvantages. The Democrats argue for top-down central control of health care. Republicans recognize the potential of choice to create competition between imperfect mechanisms to drive down cost and drive up quality.<br />2) Give individuals the opportunity and the responsibility to choose and own their own plan with the periodic right to change if dissatisfied with the previous choice. Ownership of plan provides portability and eliminates the pre-existing condition dilemma.</td>

The day’s fourth decision dismissed on procedural grounds a challenge to Delaware’s unique requirement for partisan balance on the state courts.<br />The no-fly case brought together two sometimes different legal threads on the Supreme Court: a conservative push to expand protections for religious expression and the liberal interest in accountability for misconduct by law enforcement.<br />Three Muslim men, a U.S. citizen and two permanent residents, alleged that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents pressured them to serve as informers on fellow Muslims.

Under the newly announced rules, it could take two or three days, he said.<br />Covid-19 has killed about 180,000 people in Brazil so far, second only to the U.S. The average daily death toll peaked at more than 1,000 people in July and had steadily been in decline, but a sharp rise over the past few weeks has raised concerns about a possible second surge in the country.</td>

His endorsement was strongly seconded by Pope Benedict XVI who both in France and the U.S. spoke of a “healthy secularism,” one in which the government, while always maintaining its autonomy, recognized the spiritual and transcendent dimension of humanity.

      <td>The record corporate borrowing boom fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pandemic response may be coming to an end. Wall Street bankers and investors are preparing for a sharp drop in corporate bond sales next year.<br />Companies with investment-grade credit ratings will likely issue $1.1 trillion of new bonds in 2021, a 32% reduction from this year, according to research by  Barclays  PLC. Many are flush with cash after borrowing to bolster their balance sheets through the pandemic’s economic shutdowns.<br />The anticipated decline becomes even sharper after accounting for expected debt repayments, which offset new bond sales. Analysts at  Bank of America Corp.  forecast that net new corporate bond issuance will be $63 billion next year. That would be the lowest total since the bank began tracking it in 2002.<br />The Fed has eased borrowing conditions throughout the pandemic by dropping interest rates near zero, saying it expects to keep them there for years, and by implementing other measures, such as buying corporate bonds for the first time. The efforts have helped keep the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below 1% for months. It settled Thursday at 0.907%, according to Tradeweb.<br />A steep decline in bond borrowing would be a sign that corporate chieftains feel less need to buffer balance sheets and that they will be spending some of the $2.1 trillion amassed earlier this year. For portfolio managers, it would be a mixed blessing: A declining supply of new bonds would drive up prices of those investors already own, but make it tougher to find new securities to buy with the cash that continues to pour into bond funds.</td>
