      <td>The progressive press decides that dissenters should be suppressed.</td>
      <td>Most Americans learn in school about flagship political excesses in U.S. history like Joe McCarthy’s 1950s inquisitions, the post-World War I Red Scare and the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. Yet a recent Washington Post opinion piece purports to explain “what the 1798 Sedition Act got right.”<br />The law banned a wide range of political speech and publication. It was passed by the ruling Federalists to suppress the rival Democratic-Republicans, whom they saw as seditious. The Post piece argues that though their solution was “flawed,” the Federalists had reason to worry about “unregulated freedom of the press.”<br />We highlight this as one example among many of the emerging appetite for viewpoint suppression among journalists, intellectuals and Democrats in the wake of the Trump Presidency. They increasingly see domestic enemies wherever they look, and are devising ways to use levers of power to restrict, regulate and boycott opposition. It’s an extraordinary and ominous turn in a democracy.<br />Many calls to sanction opposition media come from voices that claimed to be most alarmed by Donald Trump’s attacks on the free press. Margaret Sullivan, the Post’s media columnist, wrote this week that “corporations that advertise on Fox News should walk away,” declaring that the outlet’s “role in the 400,000 U.S. lives lost to the pandemic and in the disastrous attack of Jan. 6” has been “deadly.”<br />Nicholas Kristof of the  New York Times  called for “pressure on advertisers to withdraw from Fox News so long as it functions as an extremist madrasa.” He added that “cable providers should be asked why they distribute channels that peddle lies.” A CNN writer asserted that providers like  Comcast  “have escaped scrutiny and entirely dodged this conversation.” By conversation he means political bullying from the left.</td>

      <td>The Biden team shows no gratitude to the man who sped up the Covid shots.</td>
      <td>Johnson & Johnson  and  Novavax  this week reported that their vaccines were effective in clinical trials, and what fortunate timing. The U.S. urgently needs a supply boost. But at this juncture it’s also worth noting how former Operation Warp Speed chief Moncef Slaoui positioned the Biden Administration for a vaccine triumph.<br />One of Mr. Slaoui’s inspired ideas was to diversify the federal government’s vaccine bets with six manufacturers when nobody knew which, if any, would work. The vaccine candidates used different technologies—Moderna and  Pfizer -BioNTech (mRNA), J&J and  AstraZeneca  (adenovirus), and Novavax and  Sanofi -GSK (recombinant protein).<br />The J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines were hobbled by trial delays in the fall. But J&J reported Friday that its vaccine was 66% effective at protecting people from moderate to severe disease in a global trial, and 85% against severe illness. Early trial data from AstraZeneca suggests similar efficacy. Novavax reported Thursday its shot appears to be nearly 90% effective.<br />The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are about 95% effective, so it’s fortuitous that their trial results came first so their shots could inoculate the elderly and others most at highest risk. But even if somewhat less effective, the other vaccines may be good candidates for young people and boost supply this spring.<br />Operation Warp Speed removed the financial risk for drug makers by financing trials and manufacturing in advance so vaccines could roll out as soon as they are approved. This is the reason some 20 million Americans have already been inoculated. President Biden this week ordered another 200 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna to be delivered this summer.</td>

      <td>Beijing retaliates after Britain offers refuge from growing tyranny.</td>
      <td>To its eternal credit, the British government is honoring its promise to its former colonial subjects by offering a path to citizenship for Hong Kongers who hold British National (Overseas) passports and their family members. The need for such refuge became clearer on Friday as China retaliated by announcing that China will no longer recognize BN(O) passports as a valid form of identification or travel documentation.<br />For now Hong Kongers who want to leave can still use their Hong Kong passports unless there’s a warrant out for their arrest or bail restrictions. But Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warned that China “reserves the right to take further measures.”<br />Hong Kongers fear Beijing could soon impose restrictions on the movement of money or assets. At the request of police, HSBC froze the bank accounts of pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui, who escaped abroad in December. Pro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip recently suggested that China should consider using “its nationality law to disallow dual nationality,” so Hong Kongers who flee may never be able to return. China could also restrict Hong Kong refugees’ freedom of movement by pressuring other countries to refuse to recognize BN(O) passports.<br />Meanwhile, the atmosphere in Hong Kong grows more stifling by the day. Earlier this month Hong Kong police arrested more than 50 former lawmakers and dissenters. Pro-democracy district councilors and lawyers are likely the next targets. Pro-Beijing lawmakers have also called for schools to install surveillance cameras in classrooms to ensure teachers aren’t making “subversive remarks” during lessons.<br />The message is clear: Hong Kong may become a place you can’t escape. So it’s a shame that last month Sen. Ted Cruz blocked legislation that would have made it easier for Hong Kongers to gain refugee or temporary protected status in the U.S. The Biden Administration has a chance to do better by the cause of freedom by following Britain’s excellent example.</td>

      <td>A FISA judge gives a former FBI agent a slap on the wrist.</td>
      <td>How can the American people take the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court seriously when it doesn’t do so itself? That’s our view of Friday’s sentencing of former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who admitted to falsifying evidence submitted to the court for a warrant to spy on onetime Trump foreign-policy adviser Carter Page.<br />Federal Judge James Boasberg spared Mr. Clinesmith prison in favor of 12 months probation and 400 hours of community service. The judge said the evidence persuaded him that “Mr. Clinesmith likely believed that what he said about Mr. Page was true.”<br />In their brief, prosecutors made clear how unlikely this is. The evidence of Mr. Clinesmith’s animus toward Donald Trump is considerable. As for being an honest mistake, remember that Mr. Clinesmith changed an email confirming Mr. Page had been a CIA source to one that said the exact opposite, explicitly adding the words “not a source” before he forwarded it.<br />In their brief arguing for prison time, prosecutors contended that Mr. Clinesmith’s behavior “struck at the very core” of the candor the FISA court “fundamentally relies on” and “allowed the FBI to conduct surveillance on a U.S. citizen based on a FISA application that the Department of Justice later acknowledged lacked probable cause.” Prison time for Mr. Clinesmith, they said, was also necessary to “deter others from committing similar crimes.”<br />Friday’s sentencing will fuel cynicism about two-tiered justice. While George Papadopoulos served time in prison for making false statements to the FBI, and a federal judge refused to drop charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn after the Justice Department said they had no basis, a top law enforcement official who abused his police powers while operating in secrecy escapes with probation.</td>

      <td>Players weren’t ‘investors’ and they didn’t invent a new road to prosperity and wealth creation.</td>
      <td>If little-informed members of the public can be egged on by social media to storm the Capitol, why can’t they be egged on to storm  GameStop  stock? They can be and were. The mistake, which will nevertheless be made, is treating an episode unique and singular in many respects as heralding a trend.<br />News is “man bites dog.” What often follows is a deluge of “analysis” about how men biting dogs is our new normal.<br />Happily, the bizarre market phenomenon that engulfed a few stocks like GameStop this week, and that resumed on Friday, is not likely to become any kind of new normal. Many episodes that command our attention tend to be self-correcting. The Capitol Hill stormers left a trail of selfies and social-media posts to help with their arrest. Though promoters of the GameStop bubble probably won’t land in jail, many are certain to end up losing their giant paper gains. Day traders might be able to drive GameStop shares temporarily from $20 to $483. They can’t make GameStop a $483 company.<br />The rebels behind this latest social-media phenomenon, unlike those who invaded Capitol Hill, seem to lack any cause at all. When asked what they are against, they’ve basically responded, “Whaddya got?” Answer: short sellers.<br />Usually seen as Wall Street’s sanitation engineers, shorts play a useful role in countering the market’s mechanical bias toward bullishness. In betting against the shares of videogame retailer GameStop and a few other troubled smallish companies, they did nothing to invite the hostility of the online hordes that decided to make their lives difficult. On the contrary, by taking their short positions, they actually gave long-term bulls a way to earn extra money by lending their own shares to assist the trades the shorts wanted to make. Many bulls likely have short positions themselves to hedge their long positions in companies like GameStop and the movie theater chain AMC.</td>

      <td>A plan to extend I-49 through a historically black neighborhood has divided Shreveport, La.</td>
      <td>Fights over whether to build freeways through city neighborhoods may seem like a thing of the past. It has been 65 years since Jane Jacobs successfully rallied opposition to Robert Moses’s plans for a highway through Manhattan’s Washington Square Park and 60 years since the Chrysler Freeway sliced through Detroit. But a version of this old fight is dividing Shreveport, La.<br />At issue is an $800 million plan to extend a 3-mile stretch of Interstate 49 through the historic African-American neighborhood of Allendale, where a few old shotgun houses, once synonymous with black poverty, still stand. The neighborhood is still poor. Fifty-four homes, some of them new, owner-occupied  structures built by a national nonprofit, and three historic black church buildings stand in the path of the proposed extension. A bipartisan coalition of local, state and federal representatives have joined forces with the Shreveport business community to target the properties for seizure via the government’s eminent-domain authority.<br />“The freeway would cause many of the newly built homes to be destroyed,” says Sharpel Welch of the nonprofit Shreveport-Bossier Community Renewal. “That’s years of revitalization down the drain.” Along with her husband, Emmitt, Ms. Welch runs a “friendship house” in Allendale, where they tutor and mentor neighborhood kids from streets where new homes sprout amid vacant lots. “It’s a David-and-Goliath situation,” she says, “but our neighbors are willing to fight.”<br />Once a regional center of the oil industry, Shreveport is the rare Sunbelt city that has been losing population—down 9% from its peak of 205,000 in 1980. Allendale is emblematic of the decline. Once a prosperous black enclave with 25,000 residents, it’s down to 6,000. “We are hemorrhaging population,” says Tim Magner of the Shreveport Chamber of Commerce. “We’re a city on the bubble, and we have to reinvent ourselves.”<br />Allendale is caught up in competing visions of how to bounce back. It’s a debate that pits a local urbanist architect allied with neighborhood families against the city’s business community. For the Chamber of Commerce and others involved in economic development, Shreveport’s best shot at revival is as a regional distribution center. I-49 stops at the north end of the city, and truck traffic must follow a slow-moving loop connector route, including local roads, to re-enter the highway south of town. Mr. Manger says the new road would link Shreveport directly to New Orleans, with its international container port, as well as to Dallas and the East Coast via I-20.</td>

Stonk is a play on the word “stock.”<br />Mr. Musk has used Twitter to cultivate a devoted following of Tesla fans, benefiting from the kind of retail investor fandom that has propelled the stocks of GameStop and others such as  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.</td>

Twitter Inc.  banned Mr. Trump’s personal account in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, citing the risk of further incitement of violence.  Facebook Inc.  announced a temporary suspension of Mr. Trump after the riot before extending that action indefinitely.<br />“All those who allowed President Trump to succeed waited until they were entirely sure that he had no power left to then wrap themselves in dignity and now say ‘Let’s take away his whistle,’” Mr. Macron said. “Why didn’t they shut down his accounts before all this happened?”<br />Mr. Macron said governments had delegated too much authority to tech companies by expecting them to act as stewards for Western democracy. “This is an issue for real international regulation,” Mr. Macron said.</td>

      <td>Arnold Schoenberg’s ‘Pierrot Lunaire’ (‘Moonstruck Pierre’) so defied the melodic conventions of classical music that its premiere ended in violence.</td>
      <td><br /><br />The 1912 chamber piece “Pierrot Lunaire” (“Moonstruck Pierrot”) is a musical treasure—fascinating, enchanting in its range of instrumental colors, and deeply influential to all who came after. Yet its composer, Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951), was for many simply the man who took a wrecking ball to centuries of musical tradition through his embrace of atonality. Much of his output engendered alarm and outright hostility. “Only a psychiatrist can help poor Schoenberg now,” wrote composer Richard Strauss to Alma Mahler in 1913. “He would do better to shovel snow instead of scribbling on music paper.”<br />Such reactions began even before the composer’s most radical departures from convention. Schoenberg’s string sextet “Transfigured Night” (1899), written when he was just 25 and now recognized as a Romantic cornerstone, was excoriated: “It sounds as if someone had smeared the score of [Wagner’s] ‘Tristan’ while it was still wet,” remarked a contemporary. A musical society in Vienna refused to allow the work to be performed because it contained one dissonant chord still unclassified at that time by any textbook (an inverted ninth, tame by today’s standards). Over the years, the complaints proliferated: At a 1913 concert conducted by Schoenberg in the Great Hall of Vienna’s Musikverein, the reaction to both the composer and his closest students, Alban Berg and Anton Webern, was even more violent than the one attending the infamous premiere of Igor Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” in Paris that same year.<br />Yet, Stravinsky, the composer most often regarded as Schoenberg’s rival for the affections of the cultivated music world, came to the late realization that Schoenberg had written “a body of works we now recognize as the epicenter of the development of our musical language.” Discussing Schoenberg’s “Pierrot Lunaire,” which had its premiere at the Berlin Choralion-Saal on Oct. 16, 1912, following 40 rehearsals, Stravinsky called it “the solar plexus as well as the mind of early 20th-century music.” The music, he admitted, 50 years after the work’s debut, initially had been “beyond me, as it was beyond all of us at that time.” At one performance “Pierrot” prompted an audience member to point at the composer and yell, “Shoot him! Shoot him!”</td>

American officials also said Thursday that they were ready to take him to stand trial in the U.S. Mr. Sheikh, a British citizen, has been in prison since he was convicted in 2002 of kidnapping for ransom, terrorism and murder, and sentenced to death.</td>

      <td>Chevron’s careful strategy has helped it stay off radars of activist investors and regulators</td>
      <td>In a sector facing uncomfortable questions about the future, it helps to stay out of the spotlight.  Chevron  certainly managed to do that as its competitor  Exxon  Mobil faces scrutiny from activist investors and securities regulators.<br />Chevron took large write-downs earlier on in the pandemic, in line with European peers, potentially helping it stay out of asset valuation questions Exxon is facing. And while activist investors are pressuring Exxon to work on both environmental and growth sustainability, Chevron noted on Friday’s earnings call that it hasn’t faced similar pressures, noting that its investors prefer energy-transition investments that don’t erode returns.<br />Still, Chevron’s fourth-quarter results showed how far both U.S. energy giants are from recovery. For the full year, Chevron recorded a net loss of $5.5 billion, by far its worst performance in three decades and only the second time during that span that it posted an annual loss. For the quarter, the company’s revenue met Wall Street expectations, but one-off items spurred a surprise loss of $665 million.<br />There were still things to like. Chevron has been differentiating itself from Exxon through a more conservative strategy, keeping a lid on capital expenditures well before the pandemic hit. Operating cash flow, for example, was higher than analyst expectations, and its net debt ratio was 23%, even after having taken on borrowings associated with its acquisition of Noble Energy last year—well within its target range.<br />Strong fundamentals might be why Chevron has dodged the scrutiny that Exxon is facing regarding its steadily rising dividend. Both supermajors have stuck to promises to grow dividends; the difference is that Chevron can sustain it more easily. Dividends are eroding Chevron’s cash position at a much slower rate: For the full year, free cash flow minus dividends was negative $8 billion; Exxon burned through more in just the second quarter of 2020.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A former FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to altering a document used to justify surveillance of a former adviser to Donald Trump was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 400 hours of community service on Friday.<br />In a teleconference hearing, Judge James Boasberg rebuffed requests from prosecutors to sentence former Federal Bureau of Investigation assistant general counsel Kevin Clinesmith to a prison term—finding that the media firestorm, coupled with the loss of his job and income were sufficient deterrents to similar conduct.<br />“Mr. Clinesmith has lost his job in government service—what has given his life much of its meaning,” said Judge Boasberg. “He went from being an obscure career government lawyer to standing in the eye of a media hurricane. He’s been threatened, vilified and abused on a nationwide scale,” the judge added.<br />Mr. Clinesmith addressed the court, expressing deep remorse for his actions and taking responsibility for what he described as a “critical error in judgment.” He’s the only person charged in Justice Department special counsel John Durham’s investigation into surveillance of Trump campaign associates during the 2016 election.<br />“I let the FBI, the Department of Justice, my colleagues, the public and my family down. I also let myself down. I will live with the consequences of my action as well as the deeply held feelings of regret, shame and loss caused by it for the rest of my life,” he said.</td>

      <td>Tech companies think the statute allows them to censor with impunity. The law is seldom so simple.</td>
      <td>Section numbers of federal statutes rarely stir the soul, but one of them, 230, stirs up much fear, for it has seemed to justify censorship. Relying on it, tech companies including Google and  Twitter  increasingly pull the plug on disfavored posts, websites and even people. Online moderation can be valuable, but this censorship is different. It harms Americans’ livelihoods, muzzles them in the increasingly electronic public square, distorts political and cultural conversations, influences elections, and limits our freedom to sort out the truth for ourselves.<br />But does the 1996 Communications Decency Act really justify Big Tech censorship? The key language, Section 230(c)(2), provides: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of . . . any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.” The companies take this as a license to censor with impunity.<br />That understanding is questionable. Law is rarely as clear-cut as a binary switch. To be sure, courts emphasize the breadth of Section 230’s immunity for website operators. But there is little if any federal appellate precedent upholding censorship by the big tech companies. The question therefore comes down to the statute itself. The answers should give pause to the companies and courage to those they’ve censored.<br />The fundamental problems are constitutional—the first concerning the Commerce Clause. Congress’s authority to enact Section 230 may seem indisputable because the Supreme Court has, since the New Deal, adopted an almost open-ended view of Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce. Yet congressionally emboldened censorship poses unique questions.<br />Originally, the Constitution’s broadest protection for free expression lay in Congress’s limited power. James Wilson reassured Americans in 1787—four years before the First Amendment’s ratification—that “a power similar to that which has been granted for the regulation of commerce” was not “granted to regulate literary publications,” and thus “the proposed system possesses no influence whatever upon the press.”</td>

      <td>The great black novelist wrote about whites, but white novelists of his day didn’t return the favor.</td>
      <td>I was ready to take a punch for James Baldwin. It was spring of 1992, and my one-man play about Baldwin, written at the request of the late actor Reggie Montgomery, had just been given a rehearsed reading at New York’s Lincoln Center. Most of the invited audience appeared enthusiastic, but in the foyer a naysayer approached me. Michael Thelwell, then a professor of African-American studies at Amherst College, told me many things about what he had just seen, the most polite being “Keep out.”<br />Mr. Thelwell and I had already had a discussion on the subject of a nonblack writer presuming to trespass on protected territory. The year before, when I spoke at Amherst on my biography of Baldwin, “Talking at the Gates,” Mr. Thelwell sat in the front row, harrumphing and fidgeting. In a preface to his verbal assault on me, he suggested that I, a Scotsman, would feel offended if he, a Jamaican, were to write about Celtic art and literature. He didn’t use the term “cultural appropriation” (though it was in use by that time, notably by Ralph Ellison, speaking in its favor), but that’s what was on his mind.<br />I might have felt flattered. Mr. Thelwell was among the contributors to a collection of essays published in 1968, “William Styron’s ‘Nat Turner’: Ten Black Writers Respond.” All 10 opposed Styron’s novel about a renegade slave in the state of Virginia in 1831. Mr. Thelwell’s essay is one of the most eloquent, and I had singled it out for praise in my biography.<br />Baldwin was not among the 10. His position was in direct conflict with theirs. “The Confessions of Nat Turner” is written in the first person of the black rebel leader. “He has begun the common history,” Baldwin said of Styron. “Ours.” Baldwin was not at the time in favor with the majority of black intellectuals. His homosexuality and his habit of mixing in white society were, in their eyes, marks against him.<br />Baldwin never changed his mind about what Styron had done, despite increasing disillusionment with white liberal opinion in the 1960s. Three years before his death in 1987, he said what he had been saying for years: “The conundrum of color is the inheritance of every American.” He was not talking directly about literature, but he then turned his attention to it: “The effort on the part of the Republic to avoid the presence of black people reflects itself in American literature fatally, to the detriment of that literature.” It is a less rhetorical but more subtle restatement of his support for Styron. Where were the white novelists of their generation who had chosen to follow the example of “The Confessions of Nat Turner”?</td>

But an EMA warning the shot hasn’t been sufficiently tested in people over 55 adds to manufacturing woes dogging the project and prompted fresh attacks.<br />Some Europeans—even high officials—have interpreted the lack of data  as meaning the vaccine isn’t effective.<br />“The real problem with AstraZeneca is that it hasn’t worked the way we expected. Because we’ve had very little information,” said French President Emmanuel Macron shortly before the EMA announcement. So far, he said, “everything seems to indicate that it’s quasi ineffective for people older than 65 years old, some say 60 years and above.”<br />Mr. Macron didn’t indicate how he drew that conclusion, and there is no publicly released data to support that.</td>

      <td>LONDON— Royal Dutch Shell  PLC’s Nigerian subsidiary has been ordered by a Dutch court to pay compensation for oil spills in two villages, a ruling that some lawyers say could encourage further cases against multinationals for pollution abroad.<br />The ruling against the energy giant is the latest step in a yearslong legal tussle over the case, which was first lodged in 2008 by four Nigerian farmers and Friends of the Earth Netherlands. They had accused  Shell  and its Nigerian subsidiary of polluting fields and fish ponds through pipe leaks in the villages of Oruma and Goi.<br />In its ruling Friday, the Court of Appeal in the Hague, where Shell has its headquarters, also ordered the company to install equipment to safeguard against future pipeline leaks. The amount of compensation payable related to the leaks, which occurred between 2004 and 2007, is yet to be determined by the court.<br />The case establishes a “duty of care for the parent company to play a role in the pollution abroad, in this case by having the duty to make sure there is a leak-detection system,” said Channa Samkalden, lawyer for the Nigerian farmers and Friends of the Earth Netherlands.<br />Shell argued that the leaks were caused by sabotage. In a statement following Friday’s ruling, the company said it was “disappointed that this court has made a different finding on the cause of these spills.” Shell didn’t say whether it would appeal against the verdict.</td>

States and local governments have been investigating opioid-industry players for several years, filing thousands of lawsuits that pushed Purdue into bankruptcy in 2019 and have resulted in multibillion-dollar settlement talks with other manufacturers and drug distributors.<br />A settlement, should one be reached, wouldn’t cover other potential legal liability, including legal claims that could be brought by Purdue or its creditors.

      <td>People who have already had Covid-19 can be reinfected by the South African variant, a finding that could impact global fight against the pandemic</td>
      <td>JOHANNESBURG—A clinical trial of  Novavax Inc.’s  Covid-19 vaccine in South Africa produced a potentially worrying finding: Among the participants who didn’t receive the shot, an earlier Covid-19 infection didn’t appear to protect them against catching the disease again from a new strain of the coronavirus now circulating the country.<br />The trial is the first major analysis of how the South African variant functions differently in humans compared with earlier versions of the virus. Its findings are in line with earlier studies done in the laboratory that also showed that mutations in the new strain—which has been detected in 31 countries, including the U.S.—made it more resistant to antibodies triggered by a previous Covid-19 infection.<br />If confirmed by other vaccine trials currently under way in South Africa, the finding that people who have already had Covid-19 can get infected again by a new variant could have important repercussions for the world’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic. It suggests that reaching herd immunity through natural infection may be difficult if the virus mutates in ways that allow it to evade the human immune response.<br />“It has global implications,” said Shabir Madhi, the lead investigator of the South African Novavax trial and dean of the faculty of Health Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. “The immunity that was induced by the prototype virus is not protective” against the new variant.<br />But the Novavax trial, similar to some other late-stage trials of Covid-19 vaccines, also showed that the shots can produce a more powerful protection against the disease than a previous infection. Among South African participants who were HIV-negative, the Novavax vaccine was 60% effective at protecting them against symptoms of Covid-19.</td>

      <td>If there are no consequences for subversion and insurrection, it may encourage future presidents to do the same thing.</td>
      <td>Your editorial “Trying Mr. Trump, Private Citizen” (Jan. 26) makes the case that a trial may strengthen Mr. Trump. You go through all sorts of scenarios and outcomes and conclude that President Biden should have asked that the trial be dropped. I respectfully disagree.<br />If there are no consequences for subversion and insurrection, it may encourage future presidents to do the same thing. Nothing is more important in a democracy than the peaceful transfer of power.<br />The process could hurt Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney and may result in President Trump being politically strengthened. So what? There is no way of knowing what will result from this, but it should not stop the pursuit of justice.<br />What is the right thing to do, not the expedient or politically savvy, but the right thing? As Sen. Mitt Romney said recently: “what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense. If not? what is?” I don’t think there is any question here.<br />Cathy Putnam</td>

      <td>In none of the examples cited had the recalled officeholder unilaterally closed businesses and kept them closed, bankrupted thousands of businesses and destroy small-business people’s lives.</td>
      <td>Regarding Joshua Spivak’s “The GOP Bid to Boot Gavin Newsom Could Backfire” (Cross Country, Jan. 23): Mr. Spivak recounts several recalls that eventually backfired. But in none of the examples cited had the recalled officeholder unilaterally closed businesses and kept them closed for months, a year or more. Did the previous officeholders bankrupt thousands of businesses and destroy small-business people’s lives? Did they fail to provide consistent electricity to thousands of homes? Did they fail to provide a maintenance plan to prevent scores of wildfires destroying thousands of people’s homes?<br />Yes, many previous officeholders have suffered recalls and then overcame them. California has more Covid cases than any other state in the union, while Gov. Newsom’s decisions have created untold financial ruin for so many people. For the sake of Californians, maybe this recall will stick.<br />Julian Spratt<br />Melbourne, Fla.<br /></td>

      <td>Instead of using food and foosball tables to keep workers at the office as long as possible, tech companies now seek to offer benefits for work-life balance</td>
      <td>When Lolitta Tracy was job hunting last January, the perks she prioritized were catered lunches, commuting benefits and a stipend she put toward yoga classes. Today, nearly a year into the pandemic, she cares more about benefits she can use while working from her two-bedroom apartment in San Jose, Calif., such as free therapy and personalized advice on financial planning.<br />Luckily for Ms. Tracy, 31 years old, the financial-technology company where she works recently started offering both. She’s been relying on the advice of a retirement planner provided by her company for things like how much money to put in her Roth 401(k) versus a traditional one.<br />“I’ve called the financial professional at least three times,” said Ms. Tracy, a social-media and communications manager with BlueVine Inc., based in Redwood City, Calif. “It was just really helpful to talk to someone.”<br />Thanks to the intense competition for talent in Silicon Valley, the tech industry has long stood out for lavish perks that made employees feel as if they barely needed to leave the office. When the pandemic sent workers home last March, those same companies had to figure out how to keep their employees happy while they worked remotely. That brought on ukulele-building classes and virtual cocktail-making tutorials, along with a host of other, more meaningful benefits.<br />Now many companies are dusting off their return-to-office plans as the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines kindles hope for an end to the coronavirus’s persistent spread. In addition to sorting out the details of hybrid-work models, companies are figuring out which pandemic perks should eventually go away, and what needs to become permanent to keep recruiting and retaining the best talent.</td>

Some Islamic State fighters detonated explosive vests while others were shot dead, he said.<br />The operation took place less than a week after Islamic State carried out its worst attack on Iraqi civilians in years, a double suicide bombing on a busy Baghdad street that killed 32 people.<br />“Yasir’s death is another significant blow to Daesh resurgence efforts in Iraq,” said Col. Wayne Marotto, the spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, using the Arabic acronym for the group, in a tweet.</td>

      <td>Selected by the author of, most recently, ‘Britain at Bay: The Epic Story of the Second World War, 1938-1941.’</td>
      <td>By Julian Jackson (2003)<br />1. France’s surrender to the Germans on June 22, 1940, shocked the world. It had survived a more terrible ordeal from 1914 to 1918. What had gone wrong this time? The list of responsible culprits soon grew long: fascists, communists, Jews, the workers, the bourgeoisie, a sclerotic political culture, a shared spiritual malaise. Julian Jackson will have none of this. As Mr. Jackson shows in this brilliant re-examination of the Third Republic’s twilight years, France entered World War II a united, confident and powerful nation. Its cause was popular. Its army’s morale was good and much of its military equipment more modern than that of the Germans. But France fell anyway thanks to a devastating blow by a German army risking an all-or-nothing gamble. Mr. Jackson is particularly good on the quixotic atmosphere of the French headquarters in the final days. The commander-in-chief, Gen. Maurice Gamelin—brilliant and impervious to doubt—is depicted calmly eating a magnificent spun-sugar dessert at lunch while elsewhere disaster engulfs the French army.<br />By John Colville (1985)<br />2. When Winston Churchill succeeded Neville Chamberlain as Britain’s prime minister on May 10, 1940, he inherited, among other things, an assistant private secretary. Civil servant John “Jock” Colville greeted the news with dismay. It was “a serious disaster,” fellow Chamberlain loyalist R.A. Butler told Colville. “A half-breed American” had staged a coup. But Churchill’s energy and jocose enthusiasm quickly made Colville a devotee. The diary, assiduously kept, of this wry Whitehall courtier provides a fine vantage point for observing the high politics of 1940’s “finest hour.” The prime minister could be “impetuous, childish, violently offensive” when piqued, and full of bad ideas to which he stubbornly clung for far too long. Yet Colville deeply admired Churchill’s vim and vision (“he is full of fight and thrives on crisis and adversity”) and came to believe that his master, however flawed, was the indispensable man at the moment of decision.<br />By Stephen Bungay (2000)</td>

      <td>Movie was most-watched content on streaming platforms during Christmas week, Nielsen says, giving boost to fledging service</td>
      <td>“Wonder Woman 1984” gave the new HBO Max streaming service a much-needed boost, according to data from Nielsen.<br />The movie, which made its theatrical and streaming debut simultaneously on Christmas Day, was the most watched content on all streaming platforms for the week of December 21 through December 27, the ratings-measurement firm said.<br />According to Nielsen data, “Wonder Woman 1984” had nearly 2.3 billion minutes viewed in its first three days on WarnerMedia’s HBO Max. That topped second-place “Soul,” the new Pixar movie on  Walt Disney Co.  ’s Disney+, which had 1.7 billion minutes viewed. While minutes viewed for “Wonder Woman 1984” was 35% higher, its run time is 155 minutes and “Soul,” has a run time of only 107 minutes.<br />This is the second time Nielsen issued streaming ratings for the week of Christmas. Last week, Nielsen had reported that “Soul” was the most-watched content. HBO Max then gave Nielsen permission to share its data for the first time since the service was launched in May, leading Nielsen to reissue the numbers with “Wonder Woman 1984” on top.<br />While WarnerMedia hasn’t released any data on how “Wonder Woman 1984” has performed, HBO Max did add nearly five million activations of the service in December to bring its total to 17 million.</td>

      <td>Like its peers, the oil giant endured a tough 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic crushed demand for fossil fuels</td>
      <td>Chevron Corp.  posted its third consecutive quarterly loss Friday to close its worst year since 2016, as the global pandemic continues to weigh on the oil-and-gas industry and cloud hopes for renewed economic growth in 2021.<br />Chevron is looking to turn the corner on one of the most painful years in modern history for oil-and-gas companies. For the fourth quarter, Chevron posted a loss of $665 million. For all of 2020, the loss totaled $5.5 billion as the coronavirus sapped global demand for fossil fuels. Chevron reported nearly $3 billion in profit for 2019.<br />“We’ve demonstrated that we can survive a year unlike any other and come through it even stronger,” Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview. “Now we’ve got to come through this pandemic and see what the real state of the global economy is, and I think it’s going to be uneven.”<br />Chevron’s oil-and-gas-production unit posted $501 million in profit for the fourth quarter, but the results were weighed down by the refining and chemical businesses, as well as higher pension expenses and costs related to the $5 billion acquisition of Noble Energy last year.<br />Chevron’s share price has fallen about 20% over the past year, a steep decline but better than many of its peers. Investors have expressed more faith in Chevron than rival Exxon Mobil Corp. because it entered the downturn with a stronger balance sheet. Exxon had about $69 billion in debt as of September, while Chevron had around $35 billion, according to S&P Capital IQ.</td>

Consumers cut spending broadly on goods and services.<br />Incomes, meanwhile, rose for the first time in three months, in part because of government aid programs, such as enhanced unemployment benefits, that kicked in at the end of the year.<br />The increase in income has given households money to spend, but they have had limited ways to spend it. The savings rate rose to 13.7%, far higher than the pre-pandemic level.<br />While government aid programs, a booming stock market and rising home values have put households on solid footing financially, consumers haven’t been able or willing to dine out, go to concerts or on vacation.

Revenue declined in each of Caterpillar’s main businesses: construction, mining, and energy and transportation.<br />Andrew Bonfield, Caterpillar’s financial chief, said in an interview that while a rebound in home construction was boosting purchases for some machinery, spending cuts by local and state governments were weighing on road construction.<br />“People in an uncertain time are just not necessarily sanctioning new projects,” Mr. Bonfield said.<br />Still, Caterpillar said it sees signs of a turnaround. Its order backlog increased in its fourth quarter compared with the previous three months and a year earlier as dealers ordered new machines ahead of the traditionally busy spring season. For the current first quarter Caterpillar said it expects stronger sales of construction equipment in particular.</td>

Hours earlier, the British government had announced more details of the visa plan, which was made in response to China imposing national security legislation on Hong Kong in June.<br />The move is more symbolic, with limited impact on holders of BNO passports, because people traveling through Hong Kong and mainland China border checkpoints typically use their Hong Kong identity card and a “return home card” issued by Chinese authorities, respectively. A passport is used only upon entering and exiting other countries.<br />China and the U.K. have exchanged barbs over China’s handling of Hong Kong, a former British colony that was returned to Beijing in 1997. The U.K. granted the right to a BNO passport for Hong Kong residents born before the handover as part of the sovereignty deal, though it previously conferred no citizenship rights.</td>

California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed $2 billion for districts offering some in-person instruction. Lawmakers in states such as Utah and Tennessee have proposed bills that could result in funding cuts to districts not offering in-person instruction.<br />This week, a new study from researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who examined rural districts in Wisconsin found coronavirus spread was limited in schools that use mitigation strategies such as mask-wearing and social distancing.<br />“The money is a bargaining chip in two ways,” said Marguerite Roza, director of the Edunomics Lab at Georgetown University. More funding could address concerns school staff have about safety in classrooms, while threats to pull funding could hasten a return, she said.</td>

Josh Hawley’s Fighting for Missouri PAC, even after the hotel that was scheduled to host it backed out because of Hawley’s objection to certifying Joe Biden’s election victory on Jan. 6. The National Republican Senatorial Committee advertised Hawley’s Feb. 12-15 Orlando “family-friendly” fundraising weekend in its weekly events email, seen by the Journal, and sent to supporters on Wednesday. After being alerted to the promotion, an NRSC spokesman wouldn’t confirm or deny the scheduling of the fundraiser, and a Hawley spokeswoman and a consultant listed as the contact for the event didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Facing public criticism for hosting the event, Loews Hotels & Co. canceled on Hawley earlier this month and said it wouldn’t host Hawley’s event at any of its hotels. A customer-service representative at the Loews resort in Orlando said she had no information about the event being moved. Hawley’s PAC spent around $100,000 during the 2020 elections, primarily to help fellow GOP senators and Senate candidates. Hawley has blasted companies that have backed away from him in the past month, saying he “will not bow to left wing corporate pressure.”<br />Hawley, widely viewed as a possible presidential aspirant, told Business Insider this week that he was “not running” for president in 2024, and demurred on whether former President Donald Trump should run again or make way for a new GOP standard bearer.<br />OFFSHORE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT sees a swift shift in winners and losers following Biden’s inauguration. While offshore oil-and-gas developers deal with a freeze on new fossil-fuel leases on federal property, offshore wind developers see a chance to rebound from years of Trump administration opposition. Vineyard Wind, a $2.2 billion project off the coast of Massachusetts, was paused by the Trump administration just days before it was expected to get final approval last month. The Trump administration also proposed limiting offshore wind development for hundreds of miles on the East Coast from Florida to Virginia while pushing for more offshore drilling.<br />This week, Vineyard Wind announced plans to restart the permitting process, signaling that it expects a more-favorable approach from the Biden administration. It also said it had addressed some of the concerns about the project from the commercial fishing industry, which has opposed aspects of the development. Biden’s offshore wind agenda got a head start from Congress: The pandemic stimulus package passed in December extends the 30% tax credit for offshore wind projects that begin construction before 2026. Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order to “accelerate clean energy and transmission projects under federal siting and permitting processes,” which should ease the development of wind projects on federal land and waters.</td>

Taylor, 60 years old, and his son Peter M. Taylor, 27, have been in a Boston-area jail since May, battling a federal government effort to extradite them to Japan. Authorities there want to charge them with crimes allegedly committed when they helped Mr. Ghosn flee that country in late 2019, hidden inside a musical-equipment box.<br />Late Thursday, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani rejected the Taylors’ emergency petition to halt the extradition ordered by the State Department. The Taylors argued, among other things, that they would be likely to face torture and unjust treatment in Japan.<br />“Although the prison conditions in Japan may be deplorable and although the criminal procedures that the Taylors may be subjected to may not satisfy American notions of due process, those allegations do not constitute the ‘severe physical or mental pain or suffering’ ” contemplated in regulations governing extradition matters, Judge Talwani ruled.<br />The Taylors’ attorneys immediately filed a motion that they would appeal the ruling, court documents show.

      <td>This isn’t 2009.</td>
      <td>President Joe Biden is still claiming there’s an economic crisis to justify  trillions of dollars in new federal spending. But it’s getting harder to make the case. On Thursday the Commerce Department reported that real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 4% in the fourth quarter of 2020. This follows the historic 33.4% surge in the third quarter and demonstrates a remarkable rebound from the spring shutdowns wherever state governors have been willing to allow it.<br />Nationwide, the last three months of 2020 featured a robust 13.8% increase in business investment, including a sizzling 24.9% surge in equipment purchases.<br />Overall, the solid 4% real GDP growth is a welcome and unfortunately rare event. The last two quarters were the first to reach or exceed such a pace during the Trump presidency. Of the 31 complete quarters during the Obama presidency, only four matched or exceeded this rate. The United States has just enjoyed the best final full quarter of a presidency since George H. W. Bush presided over a 4.2% surge in the final months of 1992.<br />By any reasonable measure, the economy is not in need of a “rescue.” So in a spirit of unity, how can sensible Democrats explain to President Joe Biden that his spending plans may be unnecessary, irrelevant to the issues at hand and dangerous for an economy in which federal debt now exceeds GDP?<br />On the first point, President Barack Obama’s chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Jason Furmanpolitely dropped a hint in these pages recently. Mr. Furman noted that the economy might not actually need every nickel of the tax dollars that Mr. Biden aims to spend:</td>

Sales growth by that measure moderated somewhat from earlier in the pandemic, especially in North America.<br />Shares fell 1% to $56.50 Thursday afternoon. But Mondelez said it had increased market share in businesses such as cookies and crackers in the U.S. and chocolate in the U.K.<br />“We’ve gained a lot of new consumers in our brands,” said Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put on an investor call. “We are counting on being able to do that again this year.”<br />He said Mondelez is increasing its advertising budget and to focus more on digital outlets. The company said it has also benefited from delivering its snacks directly to stores, rather than to warehouses or third-party distributors.</td>

      <td>A social-media stock bubble is a new version of an old phenomenon.</td>
      <td>The  GameStop  stock mania has captivated market speculators, spectators, politicians and even morning TV. It’s certainly high financial drama to see armies of retail investors on Reddit hunting the so-called wolves of Wall Street. This may be a new example of the power of social media, but it isn’t a crisis of capitalism or the stock market.<br />There are two broad theories of how equity markets work. One is to focus on fundamentals like the growth path of the U.S. economy and the prospects and earnings of companies. You buy and hold a stock, or you invest in a fund that tracks an index like the S&P 500 or Russell 2000. This is what most people do.<br />Yet we market fundamentalists have to admit that more than a few people have become very rich betting on the famous phrase “popular delusions and the madness of crowds.” Stock manias are common—and wonderful until they become panics. This is where we seem to be this week as investors used online brokerage platforms like Robinhood Markets to bid up shares in companies hyped on social media that may or may not deserve their soaring market capitalization.<br />The drama was heightened as the Reddit pack pumped up stocks like GameStop and the movie-theater company AMC that were shorted by hedge funds. Most are hoping to make a quick buck by riding the roller-coaster up and selling before shares crash, though some also want to squeeze the hedgies.<br />Short sellers have to deliver real shares when their short contracts expire, which means buying shares and raising the price even more. The losses can be high. Some in the Reddit pack triumphed this week when Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management had to rescue Melvin Capital Management from its short bet against GameStop. Hedge funds are sophisticated investors and know the risks.</td>

      <td>Until the San Francisco Unified School District board stripped Dianne Feinstein’s name from one of its public schools, we were unaware of the Senator’s service to the Confederacy. While the city’s mayor, she had replaced a vandalized Confederate flag that was part of a historical display outside City Hall. So now it’s goodbye to Dianne Feinstein Elementary School.<br />The Feinstein purge is among the banishments the board took Tuesday night when it voted 6-1 to rename 44 schools. The most absurd target is Abraham Lincoln, who waged the war that ended slavery. Also canceled were George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Daniel Webster and Paul Revere.<br />The criteria used to come up with the list of villains is whether they had promoted slavery, genocide, the oppression of women or “otherwise significantly diminished the opportunities of those amongst us to the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”<br />But a name on a school is not a declaration of perfection. And a society that rummages through history to hold those of the past to the woke standards of today will soon have no heroes to honor.<br />In a statement, Mayor London Breed said that while the naming of city schools is a conversation worth having, she cannot understand “why the School Board is advancing a plan to have all these schools renamed by April, when there isn’t a plan to have our kids back in the classroom.”</td>

      <td>Biden inherits a decent recovery that should surge as the pandemic eases.</td>
      <td>You know political spin is at work when the economy grows by 4% in the fourth quarter but the headlines are that growth fell for the entire pandemic year. Everyone already knows the economy fell off the cliff in the first half of 2020. The news is that the economic recovery is continuing despite the winter Covid surge.<br />That’s the real story from Thursday’s GDP report, which showed a remarkably resilient economy amid the worst of the pandemic. The 4% growth followed a rebound of 33.4% in the third quarter. The economy shrank by 3.5% for all of 2020. But nominal GDP in the fourth quarter rose to $21.48 trillion, which is nearly back to the peak of $21.75 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2019.<br />The depression many feared in the spring, not without cause, was averted. The economy entered 2021 with decent momentum and is poised to expand rapidly this year as the vaccine rollout proceeds and states like Michigan, New York and California end their punitive lockdowns on business. Is it merely a coincidence that these lockdowns are easing now that Joe Biden is President?<br />The details of the GDP report underscore the case for optimism. Private business investment provided most of the growth with a 25.3% surge. Residential construction rose 33.5% as the housing boom continues, but investment in equipment was also up 25%. The latter fits with the buoyant manufacturing indexes that suggest business optimism about orders and future demand.<br />Consumer spending increased by a meager 2.5% in the quarter after a 41% surge in the third quarter, which was expected given the lockdowns and voluntary social distancing. Spending on food and accommodations took a big hit from the decline in restaurant dining and travel. But unlike the spring, health care spending increased as politicians didn’t shut down elective surgery and cancer screenings.</td>

      <td>BOGOTÁ, Colombia—A special tribunal system set up in Colombia to process war atrocities has accused eight former rebel commanders of war crimes and crimes against humanity for the guerrillas’ practice of kidnapping people during the country’s decadeslong civil conflict.<br />The decision Thursday by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, a system of judges and investigators who have a mandate to determine responsibility for war-related crimes, is a first against rebels of the now-defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, since the group signed a peace accord with the government in 2016.<br />Conflict researchers, victims and former peace negotiators said the accusations are a signal to critics, who assert that rebels benefited from the peace process without fear of punishment, that the justice system set up by the accord is functioning.<br />“This is very important, a crucial step for the court. It’s a sign that they are moving past impunity,” said Jorge Restrepo, director of the Conflict Analysis Resource Center, a Bogotá -based research group. “Never before had we been able to achieve an accusation like this against the guerrillas.”<br />Judge Julieta Lemaitre accused the former FARC leaders, two of whom are now in congress, of not only kidnapping but also murder, torture, sexual violence and forced displacement during Colombia’s conflict, which cost more than 200,000 lives and displaced millions. The Marxist group had long used kidnappings of civilians, including Americans, and extortion to finance its war to topple the Colombian state.</td>

      <td>Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio isn’t running for re-election in 2022. This is not good. He is a rightly respected figure. He tries to advance serious legislation. He doesn’t spend all his time talking on television.<br />He cheerily returned my call Wednesday from “the beautiful Russell Office Building.” He thinks his office was once that of Sen. Harry Truman; his previous office had been occupied by Truman’s frequent antagonist, Ohio’s Sen. Robert Taft. Mr. Portman finds this satisfying. In 11 years in the Senate, he has been known for a bipartisan approach.<br />Before being elected to the Senate in 2010 (by 18 points) and 2016 (by 21), Mr. Portman had six terms in the House and stints as director of the Office of Management and Budget and U.S. trade representative, both under President George W. Bush. He’s dexterously made his way through the party’s Trumpian minefields. Over the years when national events have turned especially murky, I’ve asked his read on things, and what’s always struck me is his stubborn sense of reality: He doesn’t let his wishes get in the way of what he sees. In the geography of the Republican Party he’d be placed with figures like Mitch Daniels—the We Actually Know Things Caucus.<br />When he made his announcement Monday, he said the Senate is too polarized, common ground has been lost. He has been moved by the response: “It’s a crazy world right now, and this decision I made I thought normal, but the response was abnormal. I think people are really yearning for some renewed bipartisanship and cooperation.” Potential candidates for his seat have called to say they want to be like him. “It’s been crazy,” he laughs, “like dying a good death.”<br />He’s 65 and means it when he says he wants more time with his family: “I never expected to be a career politician.” He intends to make progress “on the outside” on issues he cares about—drug addiction, sex trafficking, a commission on mandatory federal spending.</td>

The acquittal of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh—mastermind of the Pearl kidnapping—against U.S. advice is likely to attract renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s terrorist links.<br />It could also jeopardize Pakistan’s efforts to get off the United Nations “gray list” of countries with inadequate controls over terrorism financing.<br />Mr. Sheikh is an unrepentant jihadist terrorist who lured Mr. Pearl on the pretext of an interview and handed him over to al Qaeda associates. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, mastermind of 9/11, bragged about beheading the reporter during a hearing before a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay.<br />Mr. Mohammed’s boast became grounds for Mr. Sheikh’s appeal in the Pakistani courts. But while Mr. Mohammed may have wielded the sword that killed Mr. Pearl, Mr. Sheikh played the key role in the terrorist kidnapping and brutal murder.</td>

      <td>Long-term Treasurys could give Biden the room to spend big.</td>
      <td>Will Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen support issuing 50-year Treasury bonds? At her confirmation hearing, she told senators she wouldn’t rule it out. The idea deserves serious consideration. As the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product soars above 100%, buoyed by borrowing to pay for Covid-19 relief and ballooning entitlement payouts, Washington could use intelligent ways to finance the debt by taking advantage of low interest rates.<br />Extending the average maturity of Treasury debt to lock in low rates for longer periods through the issuance of 50-year Treasurys makes a lot of sense. Other countries—including Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Ireland, Israel and South Korea—have issued 100-year bonds. So have corporations such as  Disney  and  Coca-Cola .<br />If Washington is going to do it, now is the time. Some 100-year bonds have slightly higher rates (between 1 and 2 percentage points above comparable 10-year bond yields) and similar bid-ask spreads (a proxy for liquidity) compared with the 10-year bonds of comparable issuers. Some, including chief analyst with Dankse Bank Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, have argued that the U.S. Treasury could currently issue 50-year bonds at around the same yield as 30-year bonds at around 2%. But there’s a serious risk rates could skyrocket in the future. Imagine what would happen if inflation takes off or the U.S. runs into solvency issues with its massive and growing debt. The Treasury could look back at this time wistfully, wishing it’d locked in low interest rates—and significant savings—when it had the chance.<br />The Trump administration tried to issue 50- and 100-year bonds but got pushback from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a group of representatives from asset managers and Wall Street banks who advise the Treasury. The committee argued there wouldn’t be enough demand.<br />But its analysis missed how many long-term Treasurys could be bought up by defined-benefit pension funds looking for assets that match the duration (interest-rate risk) of their liabilities (payouts to pensioners in the future). While historically the duration of a typical pension scheme is around 20 years and tends to fall in the range of 15 to 25 years, many young pension funds pay out after more than 30 years.</td>

      <td>In matters of public health and much else, fact-gathering and statistical analysis can be a vital force for good. But data can also trick us.</td>
      <td>As she tended soldiers during the Crimean War, a British nurse found herself appalled by the wretched, vermin-infested conditions at the army’s hospital in Istanbul. She began collecting figures showing the devastating effects of the filth and the dramatic benefits of the sanitary improvements she implemented. Her presentation on the need for cleaner care facilities, published in 1858, led to reforms that ultimately saved millions of lives and increased life expectancy in the U.K. Florence Nightingale, it turns out, was a pioneering data scientist.<br />Data, when used to reveal the value of hospital hygiene or the harm of tobacco smoke, can be a vital force for good, as Tim Harford reminds us in “The Data Detective.” But the very power of statistics—the “unreasonable effectiveness of data,” as three Google scientists put it—has also prompted a backlash, particularly as we’ve become aware of the potential for both honest confusion and deliberate abuse.<br />Mr. Harford, a British economist and journalist, hopes to persuade us not to give up on data, urging us to embrace thoughtful skepticism and avoid easy cynicism. As he expertly guides us through the many ways in which data can trick us, we see how difficult such an effort can be.<br />Imprecise and inconsistent definitions are one source of confusion. Our assessment of measures such as “inequality” can differ dramatically based on how such terms are defined. Even “infant mortality,” a key data point for public health, varies depending on the specific time in fetal development when the line is drawn between a miscarriage and a tragically premature birth.<br />Understanding data in context is also vital, Mr. Harford explains. British newspapers, fretting about gang violence, announced in 2018 that London’s monthly murder rate had exceeded New York’s. Yet open the aperture slightly and it turns out that the rates in both cities had declined over time and had reached a roughly similar low level—good news, but apparently a less dramatic headline or perspective.</td>

      <td>Manchin and Sinema have to do more if they’re serious about saving the filibuster.</td>
      <td>A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. And rule-breaking by any other name is still rule-breaking. Which is why Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still have a big question to answer.<br />The two Democrats made headlines this week when they said they would not vote to kill the legislative filibuster. Those declarations seem to put paid to liberal Democrats’ plans to blow up that longtime Senate rule requiring 60 votes to pass most bills. Mr. Manchin went out of his way to assure that there were no caveats. “I will not vote to bust the filibuster under any condition, on anything that you can think of,” he told the Washington Post. Ms. Sinema likewise reassured that she is “not open to changing her mind.”<br />Progressive are fuming, even as the declarations had the effect of immediately helping Democrats and President Biden’s early agenda. It reassured Minority Leader Mitch McConnell enough to agree to an organizing resolution that puts Democrats in control of evenly divided Senate committees.<br />Yet it turns out that the promise is, for now, only half a loaf. The Senate in fact has two guards against allowing a bare majority to jam through sweeping policy changes. One is the legislative filibuster. The other is what’s known as the Byrd rule—named after the senator whose seat Mr. Manchin now holds.<br />The Senate has a process called budget reconciliation, which allows certain spending and tax measures to pass the chamber with a simple majority. Sen. Robert C. Byrd, who died in 2010, was a defender of the chamber’s “deliberative process” and in 1985 moved to stop senators who were abusing reconciliation by jamming nonbudget issues into those bills simply to avoid the 60-vote requirement. The Senate unanimously adopted his rule, which essentially puts the Senate parliamentarian in charge of deciding whether items in reconciliation bills are truly budget-related. The Byrd rule protects against the majority using reconciliation as an end run around the legislative filibuster.</td>

      <td>Will he build on Trump’s legacy or discard it? Early signs are discouraging.</td>
      <td>In the closing hours of the Trump administration, the State Department declared that the Chinese Communist Party’s actions against Muslim Uighurs and other minority groups constitute genocide. Those actions, according to then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, include “the arbitrary imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty of more than one million civilians, forced sterilization, torture of a large number of those arbitrarily detained, forced labor, and the imposition of draconian restrictions on freedom of religion or belief.”<br />The declaration came late but was consistent with the administration’s commendable approach to religious liberty. From creating an International Religious Freedom Alliance to signing executive orders that promote religious liberty and freedom of conscience, the Trump administration elevated these issues at home and abroad like no other. President Biden would do well to build on his predecessor’s legacy.<br />The Trump White House went far beyond words. In 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations providing conscience exceptions to ObamaCare’s contraception mandate. A July 2020 Supreme Court ruling upholding those regulations should end the decadelong persecution of the Little Sisters of the Poor for failing to provide abortifacient drugs.<br />In other cases, too, Mr. Trump’s judicial nominees have shown strong support for religious liberty, which will help ensure his administration’s legacy endures. In November, Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined a 5-4 majority to strike down arbitrary restrictions on worship imposed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. That order, which the court followed with other actions striking down Covid-related restrictions on worship, re-established the principle—abandoned earlier in the year—that “even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.”<br />The Framers made religion the first freedom in the Bill of Rights for a reason. They recognized that from ancient times, autocratic rulers have used religion to oppress not just individuals’ actions, but their very thoughts and beliefs. When Thomas Jefferson wrote to Benjamin Rush that “I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man,” he referred specifically to the freedom of religion established in the First Amendment.</td>
