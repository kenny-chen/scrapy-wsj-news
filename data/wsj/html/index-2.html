The president of the nation’s largest police union said justice had worked as it should.<br />Amarachi Bruce listened to the verdict on her cellphone outside a beauty- supply store in Atlanta, near the site of a  Wendy’s  restaurant where Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed by a police officer last June.<br />“If I am being honest, I never thought he would be convicted,” said Ms. Bruce, an 18-year-old Georgia State University student. She said she hoped that the U.S. was beginning to awaken to the problem of police mistreatment of Black people.<br />Politicians and companies weighed in as well.</td>

      <td>Weak subscriber outlook means streaming giant will need a big fall season</td>
      <td>The shows  Netflix  has coming later this year had better be really good.<br />The streaming giant reported disappointing growth in paid subscribers for the first quarter on Tuesday. That alone should not have been a huge surprise; Netflix has missed its own subscriber forecasts about 44% of the time since it instituted its current projection methodology in early 2019. The company has also repeatedly warned that the breakneck expansion fueled by the pandemic last year pulled forward growth from this year.<br />Still, Netflix shares slumped nearly 9% in after-hours trading following the results. The company added slightly under 4 million paid subscribers in the first quarter and projected net additions of just 1 million for the second quarter. That means it could end the first half of the year nearly 6 million subscribers short of where Wall Street thought it would be by that time. Netflix would also require the addition of nearly 21 million subscribers in the second half of 2021 to reach analysts’ year-end target of 229.4 million. Over the past five years, Netflix has averaged about 12.4 million net new subscribers during the second half of the year.<br />In its quarterly shareholder letter Tuesday, Netflix blamed part of this year’s lag on a “lighter content slate” caused by last year’s pandemic-related production shutdowns. The company expects that situation to improve; the latter half of 2021 will see new seasons of “The Witcher” and “Cobra Kai,” and some expect a new season of the company’s blockbuster series “Stranger Things” in that period as well. Of course, the many Netflix competitors now in the market will be executing on similar plans. What’s more, rivals like  Disney  and HBO Max will be adding some movies to their streams on the same day as theatrical release.<br />Netflix did maintain its goal of breaking even on a free-cash-flow basis this year. The company even plans to start buying back stock for the first time since 2012; a $5 billion repurchase program gets under way this year. All are important steps for the undisputed streaming king after more than a decade in the business. But with streaming investors myopically focused on subscriber counts, Netflix will still need a lot of viewers to find their way back indoors later this year.</td>

      <td>Biden cancels offshore projects amid local political opposition.</td>
      <td>President Biden aims to build wind and solar farms from sea to shining sea to replace fossil fuels in the electricity grid by 2035. But his plans are already running aground off the coast of Long Island in New York, where his Administration last week canceled two offshore wind development zones.<br />Bureau of Ocean Energy Management officials said the zones off the island’s coast raised problems with maritime traffic, marine life feeding areas, and concerns over visibility from South Shore beaches. In short, they were a nuisance to fishermen, shippers and gentry with homes in the tony Hamptons area full of Manhattanites during the summer.<br />The feds are portraying the wind rescission as no big deal since other offshore zones between New York and New Jersey are still under review. But these may run into similar problems. Residents in the town of Wainscott have already sued to prevent a transmission line connecting a wind farm off the coast of Montauk from coming ashore on their beach.<br />None of this bodes well for the green energy agenda in New York or nationwide. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is forcing the Indian Point nuclear plant, which has historically provided a quarter of electricity for New York City and Westchester County, to shut down at the end of this month. Yet he’s blocked pipelines to deliver more natural gas to power plants.<br />So how does Mr. Cuomo plan to replace New York City’s nuclear power? Good question. The Governor has proposed building 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind and a 250-mile transmission line from upstate to power New York City with renewable energy. But these projects are sure to face opposition too and won’t be completed anytime soon.</td>

      <td>He unwittingly calls to abolish the corporate and estate taxes.</td>
      <td>Democrats from high-tax blue areas are asking President Biden to restore an unlimited federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), and here’s New York Rep. Jerry Nadler’s pithy pitch on  Twitter : “No one should ever be taxed twice on the same income. It’s not fair and it’s not just.”<br />Deal! Quick, shake on it, before he realizes what he’s saying. Conservatives have been making arguments about double taxation for years. We’re glad to hear Mr. Nadler thinks the death tax and the corporate-income tax are unjust and should be repealed. Also, it’s nice to see him pledge never to vote for any sort of wealth tax.<br />This is a joke, alas. In reality Mr. Nadler is simply trying to reframe the unlimited SALT deduction, which is a tax break for wealthy urbanites mostly in New York and California, as a matter of justice. What makes his complaint especially unpersuasive is that it involves overlapping taxes by different bodies: The federal government has an income tax. So does New York state. So does New York City.<br />This kind of thing happens all the time. Property taxes are assessed by cities, counties, school districts, fire districts and the like. The federal government taxes gasoline, as do states. When you buy a pack of gum, by Mr. Nadler’s logic, the local sales tax should be deducted on the receipt before the state sales tax is calculated.<br />More pernicious double taxation is when the same level of government takes multiple bites, which is what business profits face. Say you own part of a corporation that makes $1. Setting aside deductions and whatnot, the federal corporate tax on that money is 21%, and Mr. Biden wants to make it 28%. When the profits hit your tax return, the feds take another cut, with a top rate of 23.8% on capital gains or qualified dividends.</td>

      <td>Bureaucratic hypercaution and delay bungled Europe’s early Covid-19 vaccine rollout. But while European regulators seem to be learning from their mistakes, the Biden Administration looks to be repeating them.<br />Six cases of severe brain blood clots known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine recipients prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration last week to recommend shots be paused. Similar strokes had been linked with  AstraZeneca ’s  vaccine, which uses similar technology.<br />The agencies said the pause was necessary to notify health-care providers how to treat the unusual clots and give regulators time to review cases. Fair enough. FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said the pause would only be days, and the White House assured the public it wouldn't frustrate vaccinations. That’s not what happened.<br />The CDC convened a meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—the same group that set vaccine group priorities—last Wednesday to review incidents and assess their significance. But this isn’t the CDC’s bailiwick, as Journal contributor Scott Gottlieb pointed out in these pages on Monday.<br />The FDA collects safety information after vaccine approval and makes decisions about balancing risks and benefits of medical products. It’s not clear why FDA officials were sidelined or why the CDC punted to a panel of outside experts, but Dr. Woodcock and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky may have been looking for political cover.</td>

      <td>The jury and the justice system again worked far better than political critics behaved.</td>
      <td>A Minneapolis jury on Tuesday convicted former police officer Derek Chauvin on all three counts in the death last May of George Floyd. Many Americans are relieved that justice was done for Floyd, while others breathed a sigh that there won’t be riots as some feared if there was even a partial acquittal.<br />Our conclusion is that the jury and justice system performed better than political critics predicted or behaved themselves as they condoned violent protests and demanded a guilty verdict from afar.<br />Most Americans saw at least some of the disturbing video of Floyd’s death while Mr. Chauvin and other officers restrained him beside a Minneapolis squad car. In convicting Mr. Chauvin of second-degree murder, the jury determined that his actions substantially caused Floyd’s death. They did not have to find that he did so intentionally, but rather that the death occurred in the course of a felony assault.<br />The encounter began when police arrested Floyd on suspicion of passing a fake bill to buy cigarettes. He appeared to be on drugs, and police tried to put him in the back of the police car. He resisted vigorously and asked to be put on the ground. The officers kept him on his stomach, applying pressure to his neck or upper back for more than nine minutes and keeping him there even after he went limp.<br />Expert witnesses differed over the cause of Floyd’s death. The police restraint was the most obvious culprit, but the defense pointed to Floyd’s severe heart disease and that he had recently consumed fentanyl and methamphetamines, which can interfere with cardiopulmonary function. But police witnesses for the prosecution said Mr. Chauvin had violated standard police practice.</td>

Mr. Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison for second-degree unintentional murder, the most serious charge.

She has worked in national-security and law-enforcement jobs for nearly two decades, serving at the end of the Obama administration as the president’s homeland-security adviser after he considered her as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br />As deputy attorney general, Ms. Monaco will oversee the Justice Department’s operations, including criminal investigations and prosecutions around the country.

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden told a group of lawmakers that he intends to propose a temporary extension of an enhanced child tax credit, rebuffing requests from some Democrats who favor making the new benefit permanent.<br />As part of a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package Democrats passed earlier this year, Congress raised the child tax credit to $3,000 from $2,000, setting it at $3,600 for parents of children under age 6 and making parents of 17-year-olds eligible. The credit, which scales down above certain income thresholds, is fully refundable and was designed to be paid in intervals, rather than in one lump sum.<br />But the expansion of the tax credit, which advocates said would slash child poverty in the U.S. in half, is only set to last through 2021, and some Democrats have sought to make it permanent. Mr. Biden had previously signaled he might also back a permanent expansion.<br />At a meeting at the White House on Tuesday with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Mr. Biden said that he expects that proposing a permanent expansion of the tax credit would run into trouble in the Senate, according to lawmakers at the meeting. When Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D., N.M.) said she asked Mr. Biden about making the expanded tax credit permanent, Mr. Biden said he planned to propose extending it by several years.<br />“He said ‘I’d love to do it permanent, but I’m not sure that I can get that through the Senate,’ ” Ms. Leger Fernandez said. “You could tell he was interested in making it permanent, that was the back and forth on that.”</td>

      <td>The company’s epic adventure in reinvention reaches a moment of truth.</td>
      <td>There’s nothing like reaching out to a Wall Street analyst whom I know only by reputation and hearing that he was just thinking of me too. Apparently I need to write something to encourage  AT&T ’s  board to get the company off its suicide mission.<br />At least, that’s the meticulously detailed thesis of Jonathan Chaplin, of the boutique analyst firm New Street Research. Legions of analysts have not bubbled with enthusiasm for AT&T’s foray into video entertainment, with its expensive 2018 acquisition of the Warner studios and HBO streaming network. But Mr. Chaplin makes a case that a charismatic megafauna of the U.S. corporate landscape is not merely a disappointment—it’s headed for disaster due to its distracted decision to underinvest in its core wireless business.<br />To buy his argument, you have to believe the 5G moment is finally arriving thanks to government auction that put midband spectrum into the hands of carriers. You have to believe a tenfold speed difference over sizable swaths of urban and suburban America will be apparent to customers, leading them to flee a carrier that doesn’t keep up as they once did hapless Sprint.<br />You also have to believe (the least speculative part) that a newly enlarged T-Mobile, which inherited Sprint’s remains, holds an exceptionally strong position, thanks to an underutilized network that it can fill with customers poached from  Verizon  and AT&T by offering higher speeds and lower prices.<br />“It’s the Olympics. The Russians are good, the Chinese are really good, but [AT&T] is fine as well,” says Mr. Chaplin, as long as it doesn’t show up “drinking a bottle of scotch and smoking three packs of cigarettes a day.”</td>

      <td>A little spending on the IRS could yield a lot of revenue that’s going uncollected.</td>
      <td>Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig told the Senate Finance Committee last week that the annual gap between taxes owed and taxes paid could be as much as $1 trillion. The so-called tax gap has doubled over the past decade, as IRS resources shrank. The number of IRS employees has declined by 33,000, with more than half of the decrease coming in the hard-pressed enforcement division. As a result, Mr. Rettig says, the IRS is “outgunned.”<br />Official statistics underscore the point, particularly on wealthy filers and corporations. Between 2011 and 2018, the share of returns audited fell by nearly half. For filers earning more than $1 million, audits fell by 74%; for corporations, 42%.<br />But it’s also too easy for taxpayers to underreport their income. Noncompliance rates are less than 5% when the IRS has information from, say, banks that it can use to check taxpayers’ filings. Without such information, only 45% of unreported income ends up taxed. In addition, the IRS is forced to rely on obsolete technology. For example, the IRS receives Schedule K-1 forms, which report income from partnerships and pass-through entities, but it doesn’t have the technology to match these reports to individual tax filings.<br />An additional $1 billion in funding would enable the IRS to hire nearly 5,000 more enforcement personnel. A multiyear program could replace its legacy information technology, among the oldest in the entire federal government. According to Mr. Rettig, such a program would help narrow the tax gap by at least 20%.<br />The principle underlying this initiative—individuals and corporations should pay what they owe—enjoys near-universal support across party lines. The extra revenues could fund much of President Biden’s agenda, without breaching his campaign pledge not to raise taxes on households making less than $400,000 a year or requiring Republicans to walk back their 2017 tax bill.</td>

      <td>Tablet and PC sales got a strong boost from the Covid-19 pandemic. Changed work habits should keep demand elevated.</td>
      <td>Apple Inc.’s  new iPad and iMac might seem a bit late to the game, but there is good reason to think they will still find their mark.<br />The two biggest news items coming out of Apple’s Spring Loaded event Tuesday involved updates to what have become the company’s smallest business segments. Apple updated the iPad Pro with its new M1 chip—effectively adding a PC-grade processor to a tablet that typically has been powered with the same chips used in the iPhone. The company also overhauled the design of its iMac for the first time since 2012, adding the M1 chip to its desktop computer lineup.<br />Investors seem unimpressed. Apple’s stock—already a weak performer this year—closed down 1.3% following the event. Indeed, while the Mac and iPad segments still generate annual sales well above $20 billion, they also both now rank below the company’s iPhone, services and wearables segments in size.<br />Both are also facing some rather tough comparisons ahead. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted demand for computing devices across the board as employees and students were sent home. Tablets and PCs enjoyed a strong 2020 overall. Apple’s iPad and Mac revenue jumped 28% and 18% respectively during the calendar year. But that might cool with the return to normalcy. Market tracking firm IDC warned in February that the tablet category “is not expected to retain this momentum in the long term,” as it still faces strong competition from PCs and smartphones. Apple’s iPad revenue fell for six consecutive fiscal years after peaking in 2012.<br />That return might be more gradual, though, when it comes to new working habits following more than a year of lockdown. Many employers are touting a hybrid approach to returning to the office, promising employees more flexibility in working remotely. That will likely keep demand for productivity devices elevated; IDC reported a 55% jump in PC sales in the first quarter of this year. Apple seems to tailor the new iMac especially for the Zoom age, adding a three-microphone array and a beefed-up camera. Wall Street expects both the Mac and iPad segments to boost revenue again for the current fiscal year that ends in September.</td>

      <td>Enormous container vessels move goods efficiently—but a lot could go wrong.</td>
      <td>When the Ever Given container ship got stuck in the Suez Canal, it showed the vulnerability of the global shipping system, which carries products around the world at surprisingly low cost. But there’s an even more worrisome problem: Ships are getting too big.<br />The Ever Given was carrying some 20,000 TEU containers (to use the official term, which stands for “twenty-foot equivalent”) of every conceivable good. Dozens of 20,000-TEU vessels traverse the world’s waterways, putting to shame the 10,000-TEU ships that only a few years ago were queens of the ocean. In 1975, an average of 27 vessels traveled through the Suez Canal each day, carrying an average load of 242 tons. By 2019, 52 ships did so, with an average load of 3,307 tons.<br />Ships’ size is directly linked with consumer demand. Because shipping is cheap and globalization is lifting trade barriers, businesses bring components from various countries to be assembled in another country, then ship finished products all over the world. Consumers expect goods to be delivered at low cost. In the U.K., a South American orange sets the shopper back a mere 30 pence (41 cents). But with small profit margins, shipping companies have to make money on volume. “Bigger ships make shipping more efficient, which feeds global consumption, and when global consumption grows, ships have to grow even more,” said Cormac Mc Garry, a maritime analyst with Control Risks. For the past four years, so-called ultralarge container vessels have accounted for more than half of all ship orders. They serve consumers well—except when they get stuck in narrow canals.<br />Ports are becoming an even bigger concern. They have to expand as ships grow. Today China is home to seven of the world’s 10 largest container ports. Ports along the key Asia-Europe route can already handle freighters carrying 23,500 containers. The Port of Los Angeles, by contrast, is North America’s busiest but ranks only 17th internationally and can’t regularly receive 20,000-container vessels. It also lacks time and infrastructure to receive many more midsize ships.<br />This do-or-die race includes so-called feeder ports, the smaller ports to which cargo travels after arriving in megaports such as Rotterdam, the world’s 11th-largest. In the past a feeder ship typically carried 500 TEUs; now it often carries 1,000 or more. “If ports don’t expand, they lose customers to other ports,” said Nick May, a port expert with the global insurance broker Willis  Towers Watson .  “Today ports need to invest a lot of money to keep going. And if the vessels get any larger, what are the consequences?”</td>

Wearing a mask, the former Minneapolis police officer was handcuffed and taken out of the courtroom after the judge revoked his bail and remanded him to the Hennepin County sheriff’s office.<br />The rare conviction of a police officer on murder charges came in a city on edge from the recent killing of another Black man, Daunte Wright, by a police officer in the suburb of Brooklyn Center. A large police and National Guard presence around government buildings and along commercial corridors across the Twin Cities has been in place for days.<br />Prosecutors built their case largely around a cellphone video that emerged a day after the May 25, 2020 killing. It depicted Mr. Floyd handcuffed and facedown in the street as former officer Chauvin, who is white, knelt on his neck and back for more than nine minutes. Mr. Floyd pleaded for his life, called out to his mother and eventually passed out. Police were responding to a report that Mr. Floyd had used an allegedly counterfeit $20 bill to purchase a pack of cigarettes.<br />Prosecutors were under considerable pressure from activists and politicians to win a murder conviction in the case, even though such verdicts against police officers are rare.</td>

      <td>Daniel Boone despised his reputation as an Indian ﬁghter. He was vastly more proud of his ability to endure the burdens of the huntsman’s life.</td>
      <td>Bob Drury and Tom Clavin together have given us a half-dozen elegantly written narratives of exhilarating episodes in American history, ranging from events in the Indian Wars of the American West to the Korean War. Among their outstanding co-authored works are “The Last Stand of Fox Company: A True Story of U. S. Marines in Combat” (2009) and “The Heart of Everything That Is: The Untold Story of Red Cloud” (2013).<br />For their latest collaboration, Messrs. Drury and Clavin have interwoven the life of the iconic pioneer Daniel Boone with the bloody and brutal early decades of the trans-Appalachian frontier to produce “Blood and Treasure: Daniel Boone and the Fight for America’s First Frontier.” This may be the authors’ finest work to date. Unquestionably, “Blood and Treasure” is among the most redolent of time and place. I felt myself immersed in the sights, sounds and smells of frontier life, as well as the lurking dangers and gruesome deep-forest clashes between grasping frontiersmen and Native Americans defending their country—such are the authors’ keen descriptive powers. Numerous excellent maps enhance the text.<br />Boone was far more complex than most frontiersmen. Unlike many of the thousands of settlers for whom he carved the eponymous Boone’s Trace through the Cumberland Gap and into Kanta-ke—the future Bluegrass State—Boone genuinely admired, and often emulated, the American Indians with whom he clashed, even living among them for a time as an adopted Shawnee. Messrs. Drury and Clavin excel not only in superb portrayals of Boone and his white frontier contemporaries, but also in the evocation of the Eastern Woodland Indians, their way of life and their heart-wrenching efforts to protect their land from white encroachment.<br />A self-aware Boone “had always despised, and would for the rest of his life, his outsize reputation as an Indian fighter,” the authors tell us. “He maintained that dealing with belligerent Native Americans, whether via combat or negotiation, was for the most part a matter of luck and instinct. . . .  He was vastly more proud of his ability to endure the burdens of a huntsman’s life with a seemingly preternatural stoicism.”<br />Boone lived a remarkably long and peripatetic life. The authors correctly choose to focus principally on the tumultuous years between Braddock’s Defeat in 1755 during the French and Indian War—a British disaster that Boone barely escaped with his life—and the end of the American Revolution in 1783. Although a reluctant rebel against Britain, Boone contributed greatly to preserving and ultimately expanding the American grip on the Kentucky country. “Blood and Treasure” offers an engrossing narrative of the Revolutionary War on the trans-Appalachian frontier, and the roles not only of Boone but also of George Rogers Clark, Simon Kenton, the Shawnee chiefs Blackfish and Black Hoof, and a host of other luminaries both Native American and white.</td>

The desire to view things in moralistic terms is so strong that many political commentators recast the past as full of men so evil they must be torn from history’s pages. By contrast, John Lewis Gaddis’s “On Grand Strategy” teaches how to live with their contradictions and understand the environments in which they operated.<br />Many of the freedoms we enjoy today were laid down by those who understood how to follow timeless virtues in the imperfect times in which they lived. Lincoln, in Gaddis’s words, “drew strength from contradictions, maybe because he contained so many. They gave him an amplitude.” If you want to achieve good in the world, or achieve any goal in life, you must learn to embrace your contradictions and those of the world around you, understand them, and power through.</td>

      <td>Voters didn’t always like Trump’s tone, but they broadly supported his strategy at the border.</td>
      <td>Out to lunch. That might be the kindest way to describe Joe Biden and Democrats these days on immigration. If they think they have a voter mandate to reverse restrictions advanced by the previous administration, even with the southern border effectively under siege, they’re kidding themselves.<br />As with other issues—taxes, climate, court-packing—the Biden administration is confusing the nation’s rejection of Donald Trump with an endorsement of a progressive agenda. But if voters wanted far-left policies, the Democratic House majority wouldn’t be so puny, the Senate wouldn’t be evenly split, and Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders would be president.<br />Beltway elites are reluctant to acknowledge it, but Mr. Trump had his ear to the ground on immigration. Voters didn’t always like his tone—and polling suggested they didn’t share his wall fixation—but his prioritization of border security resonated with millions, including many who typically vote for Democrats. Even Democratic strategists have acknowledged that deference to progressives, who by the way are now raising state income taxes to finance five-figure Covid-relief checks for undocumented workers, played a role in the party’s underperformance among Hispanics last year. Mr. Biden ignores all this at his peril.<br />By the time Mr. Trump left office, he had limited to 15,000 the number of refugees admitted annually to the U.S. In February, President Biden said that he would increase the cap to 125,000, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken later reduced to 62,500. Now the administration is having second thoughts about even that lower number, and for good reasons. The number of apprehensions along the southern border in March, more than 171,000, was the highest since 2006.<br />According to the Journal, “the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which runs a network of child-welfare shelters to house unaccompanied minors, has exhausted its $1.3 billion budget for this year as it copes with record numbers of migrant teenagers and children.” Quantitatively, this latest surge isn’t a blip, or something that “happens every year,” which was the initial White House spin. Rather, it’s a full-blown crisis, and it finally looked as if Mr. Biden was starting to treat it that way.</td>

      <td>The venerable term ‘batsman’ has been banished from an ESPN website.</td>
      <td>Many culture wars start as skirmishes in obscure corners of human interaction, sparked by a remark in a lecture at a small university or by an aperçu at a meeting of local officials. Yet the most passionate cultural tussles seem to begin in matters related to sports—as has just happened with cricket, a team game so venerable that even Oliver Cromwell refrained from prohibiting its play in the Puritan years when he governed England. (Cromwell banned other sports, as well as the theater, but halted cricket only on the sabbath.)<br />On April 16, cricket came under the scolding scrutiny of modern-day puritans when ESPNCricinfo.com, the oldest and most popular website dedicated to the game, published an announcement by its editor, Sambit Bal. Mr. Bal declared that his publication would battle “discrimination” by discontinuing the use of a word that has been part of cricket’s lexicon since at least the early 17th century—“batsman,” which, plainly enough, describes the player who uses a bat to hit a ball that’s been hurled at him. The equivalent for baseball is batter, the “gender neutral” word Mr. Bal intends to use instead. The term, he says, “will be updated across all areas of the site.”<br />Mr. Bal writes that “it can be argued” that the word batsman is “not overtly offensive.” When applied to male cricketers, “it is accurate,” just as using “batswoman” for female cricketers is “perfectly palatable.” The problem, he insists, “lies in the sovereignty of one term over another.” The word batsman, he suggests unctuously, sets up a linguistic default mode that is biased against women: Those who bat “are batsmen, unless specified otherwise.” So the word must go.<br />ESPNCricinfo has no official status in the game or its administration. It’s a private publication, owned by the  Walt Disney Co. , that is free to make its own lexical decisions. But with 20 million monthly visitors, it is a behemoth in the coverage of cricket, the only publication that has a sizable following in each of the dizzying range of countries—from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe—where cricket is a passion. Its ability to influence others is considerable.<br />The publication’s switch from “batsman” to “batter” can be said, fairly, to be gratuitous. There is no pattern of complaints from female players, no allegations of sexism. The body that oversees the laws of cricket—known as the Marylebone Cricket Club after the part of London where it’s quartered—undertook its last revision of the game’s rules in 2017. After consulting numerous female players and administrators—who accepted that it was an intrinsic part of the game—the MCC found no reason to do away with the word “batsman.”</td>

Asked what should happen if there wasn’t a guilty verdict, she said: “We’ve got to get more active. We’ve got to get more confrontational. We’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.”<br />Ms. Waters later clarified her remarks. “I am nonviolent,” she told theGrio in an interview posted Monday. “I talk about confronting the justice system, confronting the policing that’s going on, I’m talking about speaking up.

      <td>A modest subject belies the magic of Japan Society’s current show.</td>
      <td>New York<br />‘When Practice Becomes Form: Carpentry Tools From Japan,” the exhibition now on view at New York’s Japan Society, has a title so modest as to be misleading. By this standard, “The Joy of Cooking” should be renamed “Uses for Knife & Fork.” The tools are there, in abundance, along with rooms devoted to temple construction and the art of joinery, but the real subject is the ethos of Japanese carpentry. The result is a veritable shrine to the sacredness of wood.<br />Curated by Sou Fujimoto, the Japanese architect, and Yukie Kamiya, Japan Society’s gallery director, the exhibition reveals the surprising extent to which the culture of traditional carpentry survives in Japan, and by deliberate policy. The Japanese practice of rebuilding wood temples periodically, and in exactly the same form, requires a living culture of master carpenters, passing on their craft to each new generation of apprentices. It is analogous to the way that orchestras continually run through their repertoire of the great symphonies, thereby keeping them alive.<br />The legacy of this survival is made clear in the first room, where several superb large-scale models show the framing and roof truss of those temples, with their distinctive flaring eaves and springy outstretched brackets. Along the walls are hung a staggering array of templates, full-size stencils to guide the cutting of repeated decorative elements. The platform on which the temple parts are mounted is especially winning, a lattice of timber beams to be used for construction after the exhibition.<br />The visitor should not miss the exquisite working drawings for buildings at the Hōryū-ji temple complex from 1936. Although meticulously drawn as if on linen or mylar, they are in fact on wooden panel and tough enough to be used outdoors and in all kinds of weather. They were drawn by Tsunekazu Nishioka, whose drafting instruments are on display in the next gallery, the Bamboo Room, where we are introduced to the world of the master carpenter.</td>

In that Best Picture winner, the point is made that the greatest flimflams of all are the ones in which the victims never even realize they’ve been snookered. Such was not the case with the instances of deception and fraud recounted in “Generation Hustle,” of course, or there would be no show. But what kind of ingenious minds could pull off such near-masterpieces of deception and be satisfied that no one would ever know?<br />As is made plain in the series—10 stand-alone documentaries about cons and their artists—money isn’t always the objective. Ego is part of the equation. Pathologies, too, which is what makes the cases so interesting. A number of directors are involved (and producers, including CNN Original Studios and Jigsaw Productions), and the various installments are all ambitiously expressionistic interpretations of the crimes recounted. Sometimes the criminals are involved, too, willingly or not—a taped police interview with the subject of “The 23 Lives of Jeremy Wilson” (episode 3) really is “a master class in fraud and forgery crimes,” say Diego Diaz, a former assistant Manhattan district attorney. In making “Anna Delvey Takes Manhattan” (episode 4) about the counterfeit socialite Anna Sorokin, the producers had to rely on pencil sketches from their subject, who had already sold her story to Netflix and couldn’t contribute otherwise. The episode has plenty of other intriguing people, though, including Sorokin’s lawyer, Todd Spodek, who could host his own talk show.<br />To explain too much about the hustles would be like pulling on the wrong thread. The fabric of each narrative is very apt to unravel. That said, “Generation Hustle” seems something of a misnomer. It implies that there’s something new or generation-specific about convincing someone to pick his or her own pocket, or that the internet has somehow altered human nature. As the series makes plain, the accomplished fraudster is always inclined to target a victim predisposed to buy some dubious bill of goods; people who really want to believe in the mirage are disinclined to perform “due diligence,” a phrase that echoes throughout the series: The internet could have been, and often eventually is, used to crack the cases.<br />This is spectacularly true in episode 1, “Hollywood Con Queen,” in which a number of aspiring artists were lured into paying their own way to Indonesia with the promise of work and, possibly, wealth and fame. That it was all an elaborate ruse becomes clear quickly, a lot more quickly than it did to the victims—it’s a series about fraud, after all, so we viewers are at an advantage. But what arrives eventually in “Con Queen,” and the other installments, is the wow moment, where what had appeared to be an audaciously winding trail of deception goes somewhere you never expected, off the figurative rails and into the metaphoric trees. Audiences might feel, in a small way, that they’ve been conned, too. But “Generation Hustle” consistently delivers more, not less, than what we’ve been set up to expect.</td>

Islamic State militants are known to operate in the area.<br />The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors developments in the Syrian war, said 26 Islamic State members died in Russian airstrikes in Palmyra and other areas of the central Syrian desert in recent days.<br />Islamic State in 2015 captured the ruins of the ancient city of Palmyra and destroyed a series of Roman temples, tombs and other objects. Backed by Russian airstrikes, the Syrian government retook the ruins in 2016.<br />The airstrikes came after Islamic State claimed to have killed two Russian soldiers who attempted to land in a helicopter in Syria’s Homs province.</td>

      <td>Harsh but limited strikes can deter and punish terrorism. Nation building is an expensive diversion.</td>
      <td>The U.S. is finally getting out of Afghanistan. While most Americans have long supported an exit, advocates of a continued U.S. military presence warn of the Afghan government’s collapse, the subjugation of women and the re-establishment of a terrorist haven.<br />Both sides of the debate ignore a key point: U.S. troops can go back. A permanent military presence and a permanent retreat aren’t the only military options for dealing with potential sources of transnational terrorism. Punitive expeditions—strategic raids to punish or deter hostile actors—are overdue for a return to America’s strategic tool kit.<br />Punitive expeditions offer a middle course: brief, high-intensity campaigns to punish sponsors of terrorism and deter others. Large raids have both a moral and a physical force that far outweighs the largely symbolic impact of cruise missiles or limited bombing campaigns, while swift withdrawal after achieving the immediate objective prevents the U.S. from being drawn into “forever wars.”<br />Intractable wars in the greater Middle East and the challenge of great-power competition with Russia and China shouldn’t obscure an important truth: Thanks to strategic mobility, expeditionary logistics, and high levels of readiness, the U.S. military is peerless when it comes to projecting combat power. America can put thousands of soldiers on someone else’s soil on very short notice, especially against a foe lacking modern antiaccess/area-denial systems.<br />Students of military history may think of raiding Roman legions or Victorian Britain’s campaigns of “butcher and bolt,” but the punitive expedition is as American as the minuteman or the tomahawk. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both endorsed and prosecuted raids. The U.S. flag was first raised overseas during one such campaign: the Marine Corps’ 1805 stint on “the shores of Tripoli,” an expedition to punish and deter the corsairs of the Barbary States.</td>

      <td>Biden’s proposal would make American companies less competitive overseas, resulting in lost U.S. jobs.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration and congressional Democrats’ $2.7 trillion “infrastructure plan” is deeply concerning. Republicans and Democrats agree on investing in America’s infrastructure—the roads, bridges, electrical grids, railroads and broadband networks we all use. The last infrastructure bill passed by Congress, 2015’s Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, cost about $300 billion and passed 359-65 in the House and 83-16 in the Senate. The Biden plan broadens the definition of infrastructure to include more than $2 trillion in funding for things like the National Science Foundation, long-term care, corporate child care, and electric-car companies. Some are worthy causes, but they don’t belong in an infrastructure bill.<br />About $600 billion of the plan isn’t paid for and will take the nation further into debt. Democrats will pay for the rest of the plan with an enormous tax increase, the burden of which would ultimately be borne by American workers and consumers. It would make the U.S. less competitive in the global economy, reversing progress made in the past few years. The 2017 tax reforms—which the Biden proposal would largely dismantle—unleashed record growth in jobs and wages and produced the lowest poverty rate since the government started tracking it 60 years ago.<br />In promoting the Biden tax increases, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen claims the 2017 reforms encouraged U.S. businesses to move jobs out of the country. The opposite is true: The 2017 reforms stopped so-called corporate inversions, which made American companies into foreign companies. The old, uncompetitive U.S. tax laws forced jobs and investment overseas.<br />The 2017 reforms also reversed the “lockout” effect that kept foreign profits of U.S. companies overseas. Instead, $1.6 trillion in overseas earnings came back to the U.S. Most important for working families, 70% of the savings from the corporate tax cuts flowed directly into higher wages for workers, contributing to the 19 straight months of wage growth before the pandemic. Thanks to the 2017 reforms, the largest U.S. companies increased their domestic research-and-development expenditures by 25%, amounting to $707 billion, and increased capital expenditures by 20%, aided by this return of foreign profits.<br />Mr. Biden’s proposed tax hikes would put all this U.S. investment, job creation and research at risk. Under the Biden plan, the combined federal and state corporate tax rate would go from 25.8%—already above the average rate of 23.4% for other developed countries—to 32.8%, the highest rate in the developed world. The U.S. tax rate would again be higher than China’s.</td>

      <td>The stars gather for another chorus of ‘Hooray for Hollywood,’ at a time when it feels like ‘High Noon’ for the industry.</td>
      <td>Over the course of the pandemic the movies—theatrical films, that is—have suffered one loss after another. They lost the use of their showplaces, those ornate palaces, labyrinthine multiplexes and financially precarious independent theaters that have only now begun to reopen their doors and fire up their popcorn poppers. They lost their exclusivity when supposedly stellar attractions started streaming on home screens at the same time they were playing in whatever few theaters were still operating. They lost—at least for the time being—any claim they might have retained on their special place in the expanding universe of entertainment. And earlier this month came news of a stunning new loss—the apparently permanent closure, due to implacable pandemic economics, of the ArcLight chain of attractive, festive multiplexes, and of Hollywood’s Cinerama Dome, arguably the most enjoyable place in the country to see a feature film.<br />So another Oscar ceremony is about to celebrate the thrill of it all.<br />Why? Couldn’t they have given the show a year’s rest?<br />When I was a kid, bicycling off eagerly to the movies every Saturday afternoon, a magazine humorist named Will Cuppy caught my attention by addressing the question of why the pyramids hadn’t fallen down. It is not in the nature of a pyramid to fall down, he explained, then added, in a footnote, that it probably couldn’t fall down if it tried. Well, it is not in the nature of the Oscars to skip a year simply because a deadly virus kept people from going to the movies. The Oscars couldn’t cancel if they tried, however weird the proceedings may prove to be.<br />But how will they stage the event? And what movies are we rooting for?</td>

      <td>Nobody knows how to interact with each other as vaccines change our social expectations. Here’s how to handle it.</td>
      <td>As more people get vaccinated, the ways we interact with each other are starting to change. Some people are comfortable forgoing Covid precautions, but others aren’t—leading to some awkward social situations. Here’s some advice on how to navigate these tricky times.<br />Know your boundaries. Be clear in your own mind about what you are comfortable with. Be ready to put your foot down—insisting on a mask or your personal space—if anything feels invasive. “Just as you don’t have the right to come and smoke in my living room,” says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota.<br />Ask questions. It is OK to say things that your usual instincts may tell you are impolite, such as asking about whether someone has been vaccinated, letting them know whether you have been vaccinated, and requesting to meet outdoors and stay 6 feet apart. Yet be careful to avoid judgment, and don’t get into politics. If you cross that line, “it goes into another territory and those questions will often make people uneasy,” says etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore.<br />Have a line ready. It may be helpful to visualize an awkward encounter and prepare for it ahead of time. Think about what you might say in a scenario that could throw you off and be ready with something to say. “Have a mini game plan, like an actor learning a script,” says Mayo Clinic psychologist Craig Sawchuk. You don’t need to explain, or be funny, or apologize. Make it brief and to the point: “You’re welcome to do what you want, but I’ll keep my mask on, thanks,” or, “Let’s still keep our distance.”<br />Being prepared is easier than reaching for the right words “in the moment where social pressure is at play,” Dr. Sawchuk says.</td>

Nicholas Burns, a veteran diplomat who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, as its ambassador to Beijing, say people familiar with the administration’s decision making.<br />The expected appointments come at a time when the bilateral relationship has continued to fray after having plummeted during the Trump administration.

It’s played not just in such Latin bands as Santana, but in many other popular styles, from salsa to Las Vegas show music. Even such rock groups as the Rolling Stones, the Allman Brothers Band and the Doobie Brothers have recorded with it. In a Smithsonian oral history, Cándido pointed to “the rhythm and the flavor that it gives the music.”</td>

(After all, the Georgia voting bill was “drafted in the dark of night.”) But here is the sum total of information Mr. Sonnenfeld provides about the bill: “Among the law’s antidemocratic features, it authorizes partisan legislators to dismiss the authority of elected county voting officials and override the elected secretary of state to decide, at will and after an election, whose ballots count.”<br />That is not what the law does. It empowers the State Election Board to conduct performance reviews of county voting officials, who can be removed only if an investigation finds either three clear violations of State Election Board rules or “demonstrated nonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence in the administration of the elections” in two consecutive elections. But nowhere in the Georgia law did I see any provision for state legislators to override any other elected officials to determine “whose ballots count.”<br />Kevin Connors<br />Easton, Md.<br /></td>

      <td>Here’s another way to play the global chip shortage: Auto lenders.<br />The supply-chain woes that have stymied car makers have also been an accelerant for used-car prices as buyers scramble to find vehicles—and, in turn, for auto lenders. Banks are relatively bigger players in used-car loans than new-car loans. Used-car loans generally have higher yields. And car loans get a further boost because any defaulted debts have better recovery values due to higher values for the collateral.<br />Major auto lender  Ally Financial  last week said it expects to see yields on retail auto originations in the 7% range for the rest of 2021, above the first-quarter 6.66% average for Ally’s current book of retail auto loans. Leases are a very lucrative business as well when end-of-lease cars are so valuable. Ally’s auto leasing average yields have surged, from 5.2% at the start of 2020 to almost 8.6% in the first recent quarter of 2021. That is a pretty neat trick when benchmark rates have tumbled.<br />The wonky supply chain isn’t all good news for banks. Dealers typically borrow to finance their floor inventory. So when they can’t get cars, and the cars they do get immediately zoom off the lot, that hurts banks’ loan growth. Still, there is an upside to that: When supply picks up and puts pressure on used-car prices, for banks there may be an offset in the form of faster dealer floor-plan loan growth.<br />Behind the positive effects of rising recovery values and a changing mix toward higher-yielding products for banks, there are also some less-favorable broad trends. Competition in auto lending can be intense, and auto makers’ captive finance companies increased their share of the used-car loan market versus banks in 2020 from 2019, according to Experian’s quarterly auto finance report. Average rates on used-car loans last year were 8.4%, down from just over 9% in 2019, and the average term of used-car loans hit a record high last year, according to Experian. Credit risk may also return, though banks also have generally been cutting exposure in the subprime market.</td>

      <td>A bidding duel for Kansas City Southern highlights sector’s unique attractions</td>
      <td>Oh, Canada!<br />In a bid to snap up what might be the last available rail asset of its size in the vast North American market, Canada’s largest freight railroad,  Canadian National Railway ,  on Tuesday outbid its smaller rival,  Canadian Pacific Railway .   Kansas City Southern  had already agreed to be acquired by Canadian Pacific last month for about $25 billion. The value of Canadian National’s bid was $33.7 billion at Monday’s closing prices or $325 per Kansas City Southern share, with $200 of that in cash and the remainder in stock. Kansas City Southern’s board would still need to approve Canadian National’s offer over the Canadian Pacific deal.<br />The initial market reaction suggests that the new bid is too rich and that the original one was no slam dunk. Canadian National shares fell about 6% in morning trading Tuesday and Canadian Pacific shares were slightly lower.<br />But that ignores the long-term opportunity and the scarcity of the asset in question. While railroad valuations are at the high end of their historical range and recent volume trends just so-so, they are a uniquely valuable asset. Their networks represent natural monopolies that are impossible to replicate. The industry’s cash cow, hauling coal from mines to power plants, has been dying for years, but the fight against global warming makes them an attractive option for inland transport in terms of energy efficiency compared with trucks.<br />Canadian National believes that it will have an easier approval process despite being somewhat larger than Canadian Pacific, pointing out that the combined company will be “a distant fifth” among North American Class I railroads in terms of network size behind  Norfolk Southern ,   Union Pacific ,   CSX  and BNSF, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway .  Canadian Pacific applied for a waiver with the Surface Transportation Board, which must approve the deal, but Canadian National hasn’t. It asserts that the merger would enhance competition by giving shippers the option of bypassing perennially clogged tracks around Chicago via a smaller U.S. railroad it already owns. Previous attempts by Canadian Pacific to merge with larger Norfolk Southern and CSX were unsuccessful due to competition concerns.</td>

Big countries should behave in a manner befitting their status and with a greater sense of responsibility.”<br />Mr. Xi didn’t name the U.S. in his speech.

      <td>Covid-19 vaccine hiccups marginal as healthcare giant benefits from recovery</td>
      <td>After a year of pandemic-related disruptions, the healthcare industry has nearly returned to business as usual. Wall Street doesn’t yet seem to have noticed.<br />Take  Johnson & Johnson  for instance. Investors and the general public have focused lately on Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine, the rollout of which has been paused by regulators in the U.S. as adverse events related to blood clotting are reviewed. While European regulators declined to halt the vaccine on Tuesday, and shots could resume soon in the U.S., the vaccine itself isn’t material to the company’s finances.<br />The company on Tuesday reported first-quarter sales of $22.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.59 a share; those figures grew by about 8% and 12.5% from a year earlier, respectively. J&J booked $100 million of Covid-19 vaccine sales in the quarter, less than 1% out of its total revenue. The industry bellwether also boosted its 2021 sales and profit forecast and increased its dividend. That is an encouraging sign for the rest of the healthcare industry, which accounts for about 18% of gross domestic product in the United States.<br />But while the vaccine sales aren’t material, progress in fighting the pandemic has a major positive impact on J&J’s business. Medical-device revenue reached $6.6 billion in the quarter, good for 11% growth from the same period a year earlier, when elective surgical procedures ground to a halt in key markets like China and the United States. And there is room for further improvement. Procedure volume remained subdued in Europe and Latin America, and certain categories like vision care have been slower to recover. Finance chief Joseph Wolk said in an interview that a recent increase in diagnostic procedures is a good sign for future patient demand.<br />Meanwhile, sales in the pharmaceuticals unit reached $12.2 billion. That is up nearly 10% from a year earlier, thanks to strong sales of cancer drugs like Darzalex and Imbruvica.</td>

Some cities like Philadelphia banned or limited the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray on demonstrators after facing criticism from local elected leaders and civil-rights groups for deploying them on crowds over the summer.<br />Municipal oversight agencies and outside consultants hired by cities have found departments were unprepared, disorganized and used excessive force during the protests that swept the country following the death of George Floyd in police custody.<br />With a Minneapolis jury now deliberating whether to convict Mr. Chauvin for killing Mr. Floyd, some departments also said they have reached out to organizers and community leaders in advance of expected protests, in the hopes of creating less tense confrontations with demonstrators.<br />“I don’t think this time around we get to say we were surprised,” said Frank Straub, a top official with the National Police Foundation, a nonprofit that works on improving policing, and a former police chief in Spokane, Wash.</td>

      <td>Companies most exposed to risk of tighter tobacco regulations have made little progress since threat came into focus in 2017</td>
      <td>U.S. cigarette companies are caught between hawkish regulators and the scarring experience of Marlboro-maker  Altria ’s  disastrous investment in vaping brand Juul. What is surprising is that this predicament still has the capacity to catch investors off guard.<br />On Monday afternoon, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration is considering tighter tobacco regulations. The trigger is a petition that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration must respond to later this month, stating whether or not it plans to ban menthol cigarettes. The White House is also weighing whether to reduce the nicotine content of cigarettes to make them less addictive.<br />On Tuesday, Altria fell 6% at the open, having already lost 6% shortly before the Monday close. Europe-listed peers  British American Tobacco  and  Imperial Brands  dropped 7%.  Philip Morris International ,  which controls Marlboro overseas, has been less impacted. The company spun out its American business—now Altria—in 2008 precisely to fend off this kind of risk.<br />Investors now dumping tobacco stocks have been complacent. The dangers of a menthol ban and lower nicotine levels have been around since mid-2017, and the Democrats are traditionally more hawkish on tobacco regulation. In the latest election cycle, two-thirds of all cigarette industry donations went to the Republicans, data from lobbying monitor OpenSecrets shows.<br />Some may have been lulled into believing that the issue had slipped down the political agenda after a period of calm. This was the first strong indication of the Biden administration’s intentions. And the tobacco business has fared well during the pandemic: U.S. cigarette volumes were flat in 2020 for the first time in years.</td>

The manufacturer’s commercial, defense and space divisions also face a host of quality problems, and Mr. Calhoun has presided over efforts to overhaul how Boeing handles engineering and safety matters.<br />Boeing said Greg Smith, who was considered as a potential successor to the top job, will retire in July after serving as CFO for a decade and briefly serving as interim CEO before Mr. Calhoun took over in January 2020.<br />Mr. Calhoun, 64 years old, will now face a new mandatory retirement age of 70, rather than the company’s typical age of 65. Mr. Calhoun, a director since 2009, is among Boeing’s longest-serving board members and served as lead director and chairman before becoming CEO last year.<br />Without the extension Mr. Calhoun would face retirement in April 2022.

Now a small but growing number of landlords are in danger of losing their properties as their only or primary tenant declines to renew a lease, leaving the landlord at the mercy of a historically bad office-rental market.<br />Manus Clancy, a senior managing director at research firm Trepp, said a departing major tenant is usually the main issue with office loans that are in trouble.<br />That was the case in the Houston suburbs, where oil-field-services company  Schlumberger Ltd.  occupied more than half of a 100,000-square-foot building. But the lease expired in late February and Schlumberger didn’t renew.<br />The landlord, Tanglewood Property Group, defaulted on the mortgage in March, according to the special servicer managing the securitized loan on behalf of bondholders. The servicer said it hired a lawyer to file for foreclosure. The office vacancy rate in Houston was 25.7% in the first quarter, up 1.9 percentage points from a year earlier, according to Moody’s Analytics.</td>

The firm plans to spend about $720 million to acquire the existing buildings and develop the sites, the people said.<br />Blackstone and other big U.S. real estate owners such as  Prologis Inc.  and Nuveen Real Estate have been gobbling up U.S. industrial properties for many years, leasing these buildings as fulfillment centers to capitalize on the explosion in e-commerce.<br />Online retail growth, which has also supercharged the value of industrial property in Europe and China, has been more modest in India. Online shopping accounts for only 4% of retail sales in that country, compared with 12% in the U.S. and 24% in China, according to Prahlad Tanwar, logistics sector leader of KPMG in India.<br />But the pandemic is now accelerating Indian e-commerce because people prefer the safety of shopping from home during Covid-19. A new outbreak of the coronavirus in India has sent cases soaring, forcing the government to order new lockdowns.</td>

      <td>Despite huge stimulus from the European Central Bank, companies appear reluctant to take out fresh loans</td>
      <td>Demand for business loans in the eurozone fell and banks tightened credit standards in the first quarter of this year, a toxic combination that challenges the bloc’s slow economic recovery from the pandemic.<br />According to the European Central Bank’s latest lending survey released Tuesday, demand from companies for loans and credit lines fell for the third quarter in a row. The ECB said businesses seem to be postponing investments, as the pandemic triggers fresh lockdowns and other restrictions in many parts of Europe.<br />European companies tend to rely more heavily on bank lending than U.S. counterparts. That makes demand and supply of loans a key gauge of the health of the region’s economy, and one closely followed by the ECB when setting its monetary policy.<br />The dour survey weighed on financial markets Tuesday. An index of eurozone bank shares dropped by more than 2%. Yields on benchmark German 10-year bunds slipped to minus 0.25% from minus 0.24% a day earlier.<br />The sluggish lending will be seen as a frustration for the ECB, which has unleashed massive stimulus into the economy through bond buying, cheap lending to banks and negative interest rates, as a way to counteract the effects of the pandemic. It accelerated its bond buying program in March, in part to lean against tightening credit conditions.</td>

      <td>The surge in Covid-19 infections in India threatens to overwhelm the country’s healthcare system, prompting a lockdown in New Delhi, which may be followed elsewhere. That’s now being reflected in financial markets: Indian equities are hurting again.<br />India’s renewed woes may yet be repeated in other countries. Unprecedented government support for economies world-wide has sometimes made markets look like there is no ongoing pandemic, but the public health crisis can still have an impact—a fact investors would be wise to keep in mind. Recent outbreaks in places such as Thailand and Cambodia, which had previously been relatively successful at containing the disease, are a timely reminder of how quickly and unpredictably the coronavirus situation can still change on the ground.<br />Until recently, India’s situation looked optimistic. Cases fell to relatively low levels last year, despite high population density and a lack of effective contact tracing. Unlike most nations in the same income bracket, India is a mass manufacturer of vaccines, meaning that the country didn’t have to wait in line for foreign firms to get around to supplying orders.<br />In dollar terms, India’s Sensex index is down around 8% from its mid-February highs. The losses are small relative to the astounding boom the index recorded since last March, but a noticeable reversal nonetheless. Part of that is down to the stocks themselves, and part due to a weakening rupee.<br />Proprietary purchases of stocks, the category including individual investors, initially plunged as the pandemic started, but began to hit record levels later in the year. Buying by those investors is still high by historical standards, but has declined by more than half since mid-January.</td>

Those gains marked the biggest one-year increase in data on Hispanic homeownership going back two decades, NAHREP said.<br />Hispanic buyers have been a consistent source of strength in the housing market in recent years. Their buying power continues to grow as individuals enter their early 30s, the most typical years for first-time home buyers.

      <td>Canadian National Railway Railway Co. is planning to make a roughly $30 billion topping bid for  Kansas City Southern ,  according to people familiar with the matter, likely kicking off a bidding war for a railroad operator that has already agreed to a sale to another Canadian rival.<br />Canadian National plans to offer $325 for each Kansas City Southern share Tuesday, including $200 a share in cash and 1.059 Canadian National shares, the people said. The offer represents about a 20% premium to  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. ’s agreement to pay $275 a share including $90 in cash, a roughly $25 billion deal reached last month.<br />Kansas City Southern, the smallest of the five major freight railroads in the U.S., plays a key role in U.S.-Mexico trade, with a network across both countries. Its trains bring autos and other industrial products up from factories south of the border into Texas and the Midwest and haul American farm goods back to Mexico. It also runs a rail link along the Panama Canal.<br />That makes it a key strategic asset that doesn’t come along often.<br />Both deals would create the first freight-rail network linking the U.S., Mexico and Canada by connecting ports in the three countries. Canadian National anticipates the combination it is proposing would generate incremental cash flow—in the form of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization—of around $1 billion, mainly from increased revenues from offering lower-cost alternatives to trucking routes, the people said. The company believes it is better-positioned than Canadian Pacific given a larger footprint and minimal route overlap with Kansas City Southern, they said. It also owns a route that bypasses Chicago congestion, which can save days of travel time.</td>

      <td>European carbon credits are as close as investors can come to a sure thing. Ironically, the chief thing that might trip them up is too much excitement too soon.<br />Tradable allowances on the European Union’s emissions trading system (ETS) have been one of the best-performing commodities of 2021, up nearly 36% so far to more than €44 a metric ton of carbon dioxide. The project’s early stumbles, which left the benchmark carbon price below €10 for much of the mid-2010s, are now a distant memory.<br />More U.S. buyers are getting involved. Since the start of this year, the number of investors holding the credits on the  Intercontinental Exchange  in New York has risen by one-third, while  KFA Global Carbon ETF ,  a big U.S. exchange-traded fund focused on carbon credits, has increased assets more than sixfold.<br />Interest has been boosted by a step change in the EU’s green ambitions. The bloc now aims to cut 2030 emissions by 55% compared with the 1990 level, up from a prior target of 40%. A high carbon price—bullish analysts see it exceeding €100 by the end of the decade—may be instrumental in reaching that goal.<br />In June, officials plan to propose changes to the various EU climate rules to update them for the new 55% target. Two key changes to the ETS are expected. A new carbon border tax will likely end the practice of giving some emitters free carbon allowances. And new sectors will be added, most likely including maritime shipping and possibly road transport and the heating of buildings. The current project mainly covers the power industry and aviation, though the latter mostly relies on free allowances.</td>

Israel has reopened its economy and is closing down its Covid-19 treatment wards. Chile, by contrast, has locked down again and shut its borders. The U.K. is taking it slow, with a staged reopening planned over the next few months.<br />Epidemiologists say the risk is real of a so-called exit wave of new infections as countries drop their guard while shots increase, since vaccines don’t provide 100% protection against contracting Covid-19. New coronavirus variants that can evade the immunity conferred by vaccination or past infection heighten the risk of another surge.<br />Ease restrictions too rapidly and the virus will seize its chance, scientists say.<br />“We’re in a kind of foot race between vaccination and virus,” said Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modeling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</td>

      <td>Subscriptions at streaming giant surged last year, but consumers are now looking to get out</td>
      <td>Netflix Inc.’s  subscriptions soared last year as the Covid-19 pandemic curtailed big parts of economies globally. The company must now contend with people looking to leave the house more and a growing number of competitors.<br />Netflix’s subscriber base jumped by roughly 37 million on a net basis during 2020 to reach 204 million by the end of December, a performance that further cemented its powerful status in the content-streaming market. Executives at the Los Gatos, Calif., company have said the pandemic pulled forward demand because alternative entertainment options dried up.<br />“There’s a boost in engagement that you get when people are in a lockdown situation,” Netflix operations chief Gregory Peters said at an investor event last month.<br />Many consumers who get vaccinated are venturing out of their homes more and shifting spending despite the lingering threat posed by coronavirus. Airlines are looking for a resurgence in summer travel. Movie theaters and other venues have reopened in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere. Restaurants and hotels, both hard hit by pandemic-related closures and restrictions, have stepped up hiring.<br />For the first quarter, Netflix has said it expects to add six million new subscribers, less than half of the 15.8 million it gained for the year-earlier period, when the spread of the coronavirus was first intensifying. The company also forecast $1.36 billion in net income on $7.13 billion in revenue for the period.</td>

      <td>Soaring carbon emissions this year are on track to reverse a big chunk of last year’s sharp reduction, which some climate researchers had hoped might be an environmental silver lining of the pandemic.<br />Covid-19 shut many of the world’s biggest economies—grounding planes, closing factories and keeping drivers off the road. That sent demand for carbon-dioxide-emitting fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas tumbling. The International Energy Agency estimates emissions fell 5.8% in 2020, the steepest percentage decline since World War II.<br />Now, they are climbing again sharply. The IEA, in a report published Tuesday, said emissions are expected to jump 4.8% this year, the biggest annual gain since 2010’s record-setting increase, when the world was bouncing back from the global economic crisis.<br />Governments are trying to restart economies amid global vaccination rollouts. In some big countries, such as the U.S. and China, demand is coming back strongly. As parts of the global economy rev back up, countries are turning back to carbon-intensive fuels—though in markedly different degrees depending on economic development.<br />Developing countries such as China will help drive overall global energy demand above 2019 levels this year, according to the IEA, a Paris-based energy watchdog. It cited a surge in coal use in the developing world, in particular, for a big chunk of the forecast increase in emissions. China alone will account for more than 50% of 2021’s new coal use, the agency said.</td>

A small number of the total additional visas will be set aside for applicants from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, which together are sending the largest number of migrant families and children to the U.S. border seeking asylum, the people said.<br />It couldn’t be determined when the administration plans to announce the additional visas, or when they might become available to businesses.<br />The seasonal-worker program, known as the H-2B visa program, enables U.S. employers to hire as many as 66,000 temporary foreign workers a year, with the allotments split evenly between the winter and summer seasons.</td>

We’ve got to stay on the street. . . . We get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational.”</td>

      <td>The Food and Drug Administration is under scrutiny for giving too much weight to risks over benefits in recommending to pause  Johnson & Johnson ’s  Covid-19 vaccine. This trade-off is also at the heart of another heated debate over whether the FDA should approve the first drug shown to slow the progression in Alzheimer’s disease.<br />The FDA has long been plagued by a culture of bureaucratic over-caution. But during the late Obama and Trump presidencies it showed more flexibility and accelerated new medicines. Doctors who favor more government control as under Europe’s health systems, however, say the agency is approving too many high-priced drugs.  Biogen ’s  Alzheimer’s drug aducanumab is now ensnared in this fight.<br />More than six million Americans suffer from Alzheimer’s, and the number is expected to soar as the U.S. population ages. The disease’s tragic symptoms are well-known—progressive memory loss, abnormal behavior, and inability to perform everyday tasks.<br />Brain scans show the buildup of amyloid plaque and tangles of tau proteins, which typically begins decades before patients show cognitive problems. Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, smoking, poor sleep and the APOE4 gene variant put people at higher risk. But scientists have yet to identify Alzheimer’s cause.<br />This has frustrated the search for treatments, especially since Alzheimer’s usually is diagnosed after irreversible brain loss. Some medicines can temporarily improve memory, attention or mood, but none slow the neurological and cognitive degeneration.</td>

      <td>These columns noted last year that putting John Kerry in charge of climate negotiations with China was a recipe for coming home “dressed in a barrel.” After Mr. Kerry’s sojourn to Shanghai last week, the question is: What happened to the barrel?<br />President Biden’s climate envoy emerged from two days of meetings with counterpart Xie Zhenhua with a joint statement that says little new. The two sides say they “are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis.” Both countries will work “to strengthen implementation of the Paris Agreement” limiting carbon emissions. Mr. Kerry didn’t make any big concessions to Beijing, and Beijing didn’t make any new promises about emissions limits it would break anyway.<br />In one sense that’s a relief. But all this empty hot air isn’t cost free in U.S. prestige and the missed opportunity to engage in more important talks. Making climate the sole focus of an early visit tells the Chinese that the U.S. puts that single issue above everything else in the bilateral relationship. China is happy to jibber-jabber about climate with the Americans if it means not having to engage on Taiwan, Hong Kong, Beijing’s repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang, the South China Sea, North Korea, or intellectual property theft.<br />But Beijing is clear that it will ignore any carbon-emissions commitments that might impinge on China’s economic growth. “Some countries are asking China to do more on climate change,” deputy foreign minister Le Yucheng said last week. “I am afraid this is not very realistic.”<br />Instead of triggering a rethink in Beijing, Mr. Kerry’s Shanghai jaunt gave China’s leaders a new opportunity to go on the public-relations offensive. “China welcomes the U.S. return to the Paris agreement and expects the U.S. side to uphold the agreement,” vice-premier Han Zheng told Mr. Kerry in a jab at Washington’s withdrawal from the pact under President Trump. Mr. Kerry also flattered Beijing by all but begging President Xi Jinping to join another global climate confab later this week.</td>

      <td>The union failure to organize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama shows the independence of modern workers. But never fear, President Biden’s infrastructure plan is here with stealthy coercion to aid Big Labor.<br />Mr. Biden wants $17 billion for ports, inland waterways and ferries—which could be beneficial amid port congestion. But note the fine print: “This includes a Healthy Ports program to mitigate the cumulative impacts of air pollution on neighborhoods near ports, often communities of color.”<br />What’s a Healthy Ports program? The Biden Administration hasn’t laid out its details. But at the state level the model has been used to force independent truck drivers into the Teamsters. A case study is the Clean Trucks program adopted by the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in 2007, ostensibly to reduce diesel emissions. The plan banned trucks made before 1989, phased in higher emissions standards, and imposed a new cargo fee.<br />But the Port of Los Angeles gave the real game away with a provision banning independent owner-operator truckers. Within five years only employees of big trucking companies would have had access to the port, on the fact-free claim that these firms would invest in cleaner trucks. The plan also required trucking companies to sign a “concession agreement” that essentially gave the port control over employment practices.<br />This was a gift to the Teamsters. The feds deregulated trucking in 1980, and it has become a thriving bastion of blue-collar entrepreneurship. Most drivers prefer the flexibility and opportunity of the owner-operator model, and an estimated 80% of truckers that service the LA and Long Beach ports are independent contractors. Unions can’t legally organize them. The ports’ ban was a bid to re-regulate the industry under the guise of environmentalism.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court appeared unreceptive Monday to arguments that federal law allows noncitizens to seek lawful permanent residency when they entered the U.S. illegally but were later authorized to remain because of disasters in their homelands.<br />Some 400,000 people from about a dozen countries have temporary protected status permitting them to remain in the U.S. Despite the program’s name, all arrived at least five years ago. And the vast majority have been in the U.S. for decades, as successive administrations extended the reprieves originally granted because of natural or humanitarian disasters, such as the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.<br />In general, federal law requires that noncitizens be “inspected and admitted or paroled" to the U.S. and maintain lawful status as nonimmigrants in order to later seek permanent residency. While temporary protected status means noncitizens can legally stay in the U.S., the issue was whether it also confers lawful admission to the country.<br />Justice Samuel Alito expressed his doubts. Why, he asked, would Congress “leave it to the courts to infer that ‘lawful status as a nonimmigrant’ necessarily means inspection and admission?”<br />“Some of those forms of lawful status, such as asylum, do not require admission,” said Amy Saharia, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs. “But Congress chose a form of lawful status, nonimmigrant status, in which admission is inherent,” she said.</td>

The sale of the roughly 10% stake valued Oatly at about $2 billion. In February, the oat-milk maker confidentially filed for an IPO in the U.S.<br />The retail value of the plant-based dairy industry in the Americas is expected to hit $7 billion by 2025, according to Euromonitor.<br />The growing appetite for plant-based alternatives has put pressure on dairy-milk companies like  Dean Foods Co. , which filed for bankruptcy in 2019. Meanwhile, companies focused on plant-based alternatives have seen demand from consumers and investors alike take off in recent years. For example, shares of plant-based food maker  Beyond Meat Inc.  have increased 441% since it went public in 2019.</td>

Messrs. Nordean and Biggs, who have pleaded not guilty, were charged earlier this year and have been confined to home detention.<br />Timothy J. Kelly, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., said the severity of the charges facing the two men swayed his decision to detain them. For close to an hour, Judge Kelly read from the men’s social-media posts and other evidence filed by prosecutors, which recounted how both men had allegedly organized members of the Proud Boys to come to Washington on Jan. 6 and eventually to riot inside the Capitol.<br />In his decision, Judge Kelly cited Messrs. Nordean and Biggs’ lack of apparent remorse and described their alleged actions challenging the election results in stark terms. “Our republic is threatened by such conduct,” Judge Kelly said.<br />An earlier Wall Street Journal investigation found that the Proud Boys, who describe themselves as a men’s organization for “Western chauvinists,” were key instigators of the riot.</td>

      <td>The problem isn’t only the overreaction to the virus but the diminution of every other problem.</td>
      <td>What are the lessons of Covid-19? It depends who you ask. Some believe politicization of the pandemic response cost lives. Others believe a stronger U.S. public-health system would have reduced Covid-19 deaths significantly. Still others say lockdowns should have been longer and more stringent, or that they were ineffective. But one lesson that should transcend ideological differences: Don’t put one illness above all other problems in society, a condition known as “Covid mania.”<br />The novel coronavirus has caused suffering and heartbreak, particularly for older adults and their loved ones. But it also has a low mortality rate among most people and especially the young—estimated at 0.01% for people under 40—and therefore never posed a serious threat to social and economic institutions. Compassion and realism need not be enemies. But Covid mania crowded out reasoned and wise policy making.<br />Americans groaned when leaders first called for “two weeks to slow the spread” in March 2020. Months later, many of these same Americans hardly blinked when leaders declared that lockdowns should continue indefinitely. For months Covid had been elevated above all other problems in society. Over time new rules were written and new norms accepted.<br />Liberty has played a special role in U.S. history, fueling advances from independence to emancipation to the fight for equal rights for women and racial minorities.  Unfortunately, Covid mania led many policy makers to treat liberty as a nuisance rather than a core American principle.<br />Covid mania has also wreaked havoc on science and its influence on policy. While scientists’ passion for discovery and improving health has fueled research on the novel coronavirus, Covid mania has interpreted scientific advancements through an increasingly narrow frame. There has only been one question: How can scientific findings be deployed to reduce Covid-19 spread? It hasn’t mattered how impractical these measures may be.

      <td>How to create new jobs by the thousands while ameliorating climate change.</td>
      <td>As President Biden convenes the virtual Leaders Summit on Climate later this month, America has a unique opportunity to spearhead a breakthrough approach to reducing carbon emissions.<br />About 80% of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions come from three critical sectors of the economy: power generation, commercial transportation and industrial manufacturing. Meaningful progress toward achieving the world’s climate goals requires emission reductions from these sectors.<br />One of the proven technologies available that could play a major role is carbon capture and storage, or CCS, the process of sequestering industrial emissions and safely storing them permanently underground. CCS also promises the potential to reduce carbon emissions significantly at a cost competitive to other solutions, especially for the manufacturing sector.<br />For the past three years at  ExxonMobil  we have been studying the concept of creating multiuser CCS “hubs” in industrial areas. They would be located near safe geologic storage sites. A CCS Innovation Zone would bring together government incentives and private-sector investment.<br />The heavy-industry area of the Houston Ship Channel on the Gulf Coast of Texas is an ideal location to apply this concept. This area houses one of the country’s largest sources of industrial emissions and is close to the Gulf of Mexico’s vast subsurface storage potential, where the CO2 would be permanently stored in the pore space of the rocks, thousands of feet below the seafloor.</td>

      <td>If Chesterton’s right about humor, laughter can be sanctifying.</td>
      <td>G.K. Chesterton closed out “Orthodoxy,” his 1908 masterpiece of Christian apologetics, with a radical thought. He proposed that the one thing too great for God to have shown us when he walked on the earth was his mirth. This suggests that the idea of a blissfulness we can’t even imagine was important to Chesterton. The mere possibility it’s true, that one thing our mortal minds can’t begin to fathom about God’s nature is his joyousness, offers me consolation beyond measure.<br />It comforts me because it means that laughter—one manifestation of earthly joy I love to experience—is far from mundane. It can be sanctifying. In its edifying echo can be heard something important about the Divine, unreachable by reason alone, if only we listen. Rollicking mysticism that effortlessly makes your sides hurt: What’s not to like about that?<br />This hopeful insight makes me think differently about cheery laughter. Does humor reflect something about God’s loving creativity, conceiving of something good out of nothing? Or his perfect patience in playing the long game with us, his imperfect creations, which surely requires a sense of humor?<br />Chesterton loved paradoxes, so it shouldn’t surprise us that the best and wisest jokes often come from children. I experienced such a moment the other day. My 10-year-old son, Jack, and I simultaneously noticed that my wife, Devin, had conspicuously removed her engagement ring and placed it atop a paper towel on the kitchen counter.<br />Surely she was going to put it back on, but there it sat, for a moment as foreboding to me as a Dear John letter. And not only to me. Picking up on the disquiet, Jack looked up and deadpanned: “Well, I guess she played us both for fools.”</td>

      <td><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-biden-union-guy-11618871294?mod=opinion_lead_pos8">Joe Biden, ‘Union Guy’</a></td>
      <td>The president’s labor agenda is the same one he brought to Washington in 1973.</td>
      <td>“I’m a union guy,” says Joe Biden. He’s been saying this since he kicked off his presidential campaign at a Teamsters hall in Pittsburgh two years ago, and he said it again at the White House recently when he launched his American Jobs Plan.<br />So when a union sought to organize the 5,876 workers at an  Amazon  warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., it came as no surprise that Mr. Biden lent his imprimatur to the effort. What did come as a surprise was the outcome. The employees ended up voting against the union by a margin of more than 2 to 1—a blow to Big Labor, a shock to the press, and a personal embarrassment for the president, who plainly thought it would go the other way.<br />Though Labor Secretary Marty Walsh shrugged off the defeat, it isn’t a hopeful sign for the Biden administration’s efforts to reverse the slide in private-sector union membership from a peak of 34.8% in 1954 to 6.3% today. This American Jobs Plan is the latest in a White House agenda whose scope and spending has the media chattering about a “transformative presidency” on the order of FDR. The president loves to talk about a gleaming new economy full of green, unionized and well-paid jobs, but if Mr. Biden really does succeed in transforming the American economy, it will be with an industrial policy that takes us back to the 1970s.<br />For Mr. Biden shares the old prevailing assumption that labor and capital are enemies. In this dynamic, a union is the only hope for better pay and job security. To be fair, it might have looked that way for much of American history, with big strikes that often turned ugly on both sides a regular feature of American life.<br />Much of the press implicitly accepts this template too. Maybe that’s why so many stories from Alabama presented Amazon’s warehouse as if it were a sweatshop out of “Norma Rae,” the 1979 union drama that won Sally Field an Oscar. Except that in the real-life sequel, rather than looking to a union as the key to their job security and well being, the Amazon workers weighed the risks and benefits and said no thanks.</td>
