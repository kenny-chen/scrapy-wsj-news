      <td>Mexican attorney general’s office finds no evidence Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos protected or aided cartel members</td>
      <td>MEXICO CITY—Mexico’s attorney general’s office said on Thursday it wouldn’t press charges against the country’s former defense minister, who had been arrested by the U.S. in October on charges he was in the pay of drug traffickers but was returned to Mexico following a diplomatic uproar.<br />In a statement, Mexico’s attorney general’s office said it had analyzed evidence provided by the U.S. in November and concluded that Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos had not had any communication or meeting with any criminal group and therefore wouldn’t face prosecution.<br />The attorney general’s office said it also examined the general’s assets and found the general’s net worth had not grown in any way as to suggest illegal enrichment.<br />U.S. agents arrested Gen. Cienfuegos in October as he arrived in Los Angeles for a family vacation, accusing him of taking bribes in exchange for protecting cartel leaders when he was defense minister between 2012 to 2018. When he was returned in November, Mexico promised to carry out its own investigation.<br />Analysts said that the government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador may have had political motives for not going after the former general, whose arrest angered senior military officers in Mexico. Many top brass believed the U.S., which had not informed Mexico of its probe against the general, had violated Mexico’s sovereignty in arresting Gen. Cienfuegos.</td>

      <td>The president-elect’s plan could rapidly cut unemployment—but at a hefty price</td>
      <td>There are two ways for the federal government to address income inequality. One is to redistribute more money to people at the bottom of the income ladder. The other is to use the tools of fiscal and monetary policy to drive unemployment low enough to drive up demand and wages for those workers.<br />President-elect Joe Biden is trying to do both. A sizable chunk of the $1.9 trillion fiscal plan he laid out Thursday is aimed at lower-income people, and, in combination with ultralow interest rates and widespread vaccination, the stimulus could drive down unemployment far faster than after any other recent recession.<br />Mr. Biden proposed raising the child tax credit 50% to $3,000 or more for the year and making it refundable, meaning families who owe less tax than the credit would get a check for the difference. He would extend and boost enhanced weekly unemployment insurance benefits by $100 from the $300 in December’s stimulus package to $400. He would extend a 15% increase in food stamps through the summer, raise the maximum earned-income tax credit for childless adults by nearly $1,000 and extend it to more people.<br />Those steps, plus adding $1,400 to the $600-per-adult checks approved in December, would slash the poverty rate from 12.6% to 9%, or by more than 11 million people, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University. The number of children in poverty would drop by half, or 5 million.<br />Then there’s the macroeconomic impact. If Mr. Biden’s proposal is enacted, it would, along with $900 billion in December and previous measures, add $5.3 trillion to deficits, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That’s a staggering 25% of gross domestic product.</td>

Spending increased on home improvement, health and personal-care products, clothing and gasoline.<br />Excluding motor vehicles and gasoline, retail spending fell by 2.1% during the month.</td>

      <td>Bank’s profit edges up 4%, though revenue falls nearly 10% in fourth quarter</td>
      <td>Wells Fargo  & Co.’s profit rose 4% in the final three months of the year.<br />The San Francisco-based lender said Friday that it made $2.99 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $2.87 billion a year earlier. Per-share profit totaled 64 cents, compared with analyst forecasts of 59 cents.<br />Wells Fargo’s results reflect a topsy-turvy year in which the pandemic-induced recession forced lenders to sock away tens of billions of dollars to prepare for a wave of soured loans. The bank released $757 million from its pile of reserves in the fourth quarter, largely because it no longer had to stow away cash on a book of student loans it sold.<br />Net charge-offs remained low at $584 million, down almost a quarter from a year earlier. So far, the government’s expanded unemployment, stimulus checks, small business relief and loan deferral programs have staved off widespread loan losses, but bank executives caution they could still be coming.<br />With banks so far weathering the crisis, regulators at the Federal Reserve said last month they could start buying back their own stock again, though total shareholder returns are limited to the quarterly profit they generated over the past year. Wells Fargo said its board approved the repurchase of an additional 500 million shares.</td>

      <td>The S&P 500 is on track to end the week with losses  as investors worry that new stimulus plans will lead to higher taxes</td>
      <td>U.S. stock futures edged lower Friday as some investors grew concerned that President-elect Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan could lead to higher taxes.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 fell 0.4%, indicating the benchmark index may decline for a second day. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq-100 wavered between gains and losses, and those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5%.<br />The S&P 500 is on track to end the week lower, erasing some of the gains made in early January when the gauge rallied to a record high. Markets have for weeks cheered Democrats’ plans to expand government spending and bolster the economic rebound. But the size of Mr. Biden’s plans, laid out late Thursday, served to check some of that optimism.<br />“The magnitude obviously was surprising on the upside,” said Wei Li, head of investment strategy for  BlackRock ’s  exchange-traded fund and index investments for Europe, Middle East and Africa. “With the Senate majority, [taxes] could be coming in the medium term and that is something the market has to assess as well.”<br />Ahead of the opening bell,  JPMorgan Chase  shares edged down less than 1%. The bank on Friday reported its highest-ever quarterly profit, though its full-year earnings fell 20%. Shares of Wells Fargo fell 3.7% after its revenue fell more than forecast, with lower interest rates weighing on net interest income. Citigroup slid over 2% as it reported fourth-quarter results.</td>

Still, that beat the $1.34 expected by analysts polled by FactSet.<br />Revenue fell 10% to $16.5 billion, falling short of the $16.72 billion analysts expected.<br />For all of 2020, a year of upheaval in the economy, profit at the nation’s third-biggest bank by assets fell 41% to $11.37 billion and revenue was flat at $74.3 billion. Like its big bank peers, Citigroup enjoyed strong results from its Wall Street operations, but that was offset by the billions of dollars the bank had to put aside for potentially bad loans.<br />In a sign its outlook on the economy has improved, Citigroup drew down $1.5 billion of the reserves the bank had put aside for future loan losses, a big reason the bank’s profit was better than expected.</td>

      <td>Sick of the same old spaghetti? Try red-wine pasta with chestnuts and pancetta, or fettuccine with a luscious mushroom ragù. 5 quick, comforting recipes that put the new back in noodles.</td>
      <td>WHEN IT COMES to ease, speed, thrift, comfort, satisfaction and sheer belovedness, can any food compete with pasta? And yet, for all those good reasons, it’s easy to get into a pasta rut, rotating through the same standard sauces on autopilot. With that in mind, each of the recipes provided here incorporates an unexpected ingredient or a technique that surprises.<br />In the recipe for red-wine pasta with pancetta and chestnuts at right, the pasta finishes cooking in the red wine, drinking it up, which gives the glistening noodles a gorgeous burgundy hue and a rare depth of flavor. It’s an elegant dish, taking a weeknight pasta somewhere a bit more sumptuous. Using jarred chestnuts makes this a quick recipe—no need to peel the nuts, a terribly fussy business. Making this dish also happens to be a good way to use up leftover red wine, if you have a few open bottles. While a Tuscan red might be the most natural choice for a pasta sauce, I find a fruit-forward California Cabernet marries well with the natural sweetness of the chestnuts.<br />A few of these recipes come from restaurants I’ve sorely missed during lockdown. In her strozzapreti with carrots, Lena Ciardullo, executive chef of Union Square Café in New York, situates the carrot, normally a supporting player, at center stage. She roasts her carrots with fennel and ground coriander, then combines them with crisp pancetta, charred scallions, Fresno peppers and basil. A generous cup of stracciatella—the luxuriously rich center of a ball of burrata cheese—provides a tangy creaminess that counters the sweetness of the roasted carrots.<br />At Lilia in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, chef-proprietor Missy Robbins rethinks a classic cacio e pepe, swapping in pink peppercorns for the usual black ones. Pink peppercorns are actually berries and unrelated, botanically, to black pepper. They do have a peppery flavor: a slightly floral blooming heat that teases the palate. (One word of warning: Pink peppercorns are in the cashew family and should be avoided by anyone allergic to tree nuts.) To emulsify the sauce, Ms. Robbins simply adds pasta water to a little melted butter and stirs for a few moments, making this perhaps the fastest pasta sauce I know. Mafaldine is a long, flat and wide pasta with a ruffle to its edges. If you can’t find it, use another ribbonlike pasta such as fettuccine or tagliatelle.<br />Nancy Silverton, the Los Angeles doyenne of all things pasta—and, for that matter, pizza and bread—makes ingenious use of leftover bread to thicken a sauce of olive oil, garlic and chile flakes. It’s economical, speedy and requires no skill. Simply fry breadcrumbs in good olive oil. Reserve a portion of them to be added at the end for texture and crunch; cook the remainder in a bit of pasta water until they melt, along with the garlic, into a smooth sauce. The result is at once garlicky and gentle, soft and crisp. Most likely, it will not require a trip to the grocery store.</td>

      <td>LONDON—In a resounding win for insurance policyholders, the U.K. Supreme Court on Friday ruled that insurers must pay out disputed claims related to the coronavirus to a range of businesses, ending a legal case spanning months and potentially setting a precedent for other jurisdictions.<br />The Supreme Court dismissed insurers’ appeals brought after a High Court ruling in September found mostly in favor of policyholders. The Financial Conduct Authority, the country’s securities watchdog, had brought that test case to resolve uncertainties surrounding business-interruption cover.<br />The case has been watched closely, as millions of companies world-wide lodge claims and grapple with their insurance companies. In the U.S., legal battles over business-interruption policies have unfurled across states, leading to various judgments. Of the roughly 100 rulings in suits between businesses and their insurers, about three-quarters have found in favor of insurers, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.<br />At the time of the High Court ruling, the FCA said the judgment found that most, but not all, of the clauses considered by the court provide cover. The ruling Friday draws a line under the matter and could affect up to 370,000 policyholders with billions of pounds of claims. Though only eight insurers were parties to the test case, the regulator expects the decision to apply to all insurers in its remit.<br />“Today’s judgment decisively removes many of the roadblocks to claims by policyholders,” said Sheldon Mills, executive director, consumers and competition at the FCA.</td>

      <td>Fearing the import of new coronavirus strains, one state wants to repurpose remote camps designed for resources workers</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—Australia has relied on one of the world’s most aggressive quarantine programs to keep the coronavirus at bay. Now, one leader wants to go further by housing returned travelers in Outback camps far from cities as new Covid-19 variants threaten the country’s success.<br />The premier of Queensland state wants to repurpose camps designed for resources workers as isolation hubs in remote scrubland where temperatures can top 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It follows an outbreak of a highly contagious coronavirus strain at a quarantine hotel in Brisbane, Australia’s third-largest city and the state capital, with a population of about 2.5 million people.<br />“I think with this new strain, we have to put all options on the table, and these are sensible, rational options,” said Annastacia Palaszczuk, who was re-elected as Queensland premier in late October in part due to her center-left government’s tough measures to contain Covid-19.<br />The idea of using remote camps illustrates how leaders in places that had crushed the virus are considering more extreme measures to protect people from new variants of the coronavirus, which emerged in the U.K. and South Africa and have since spread to more countries. Currently, travelers returning to Australia are housed in hotels, often close to city airports, for 14 days.<br />Queensland was on a run of almost four months without a case of local transmission when a cleaner at a quarantine hotel in Brisbane tested positive for the new U.K. variant. More cases followed, and 129 people who were isolating were soon moved to another hotel and had their quarantine extended.</td>

      <td>SEOUL—North Korea has long kept its adversaries on their toes with taunting rhetoric and surprise weapons tests.<br />As President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office, leader Kim Jong Un offered a sneak peek of Pyongyang’s pipeline of military hardware with unusual detail during a rare Workers’ Party Congress meeting that ended this week.<br />The North is developing military drones, a nuclear-powered submarine and surveillance satellites, Mr. Kim said. Missiles will get smaller and lighter. Others will fly farther.<br />A hypersonic warhead, which generally can travel a mile per second, is ready for testing and production, he said. The guidance technology for a multi-warhead rocket, presumed to be for an intercontinental ballistic missile, is at its final stage.<br />At a Thursday night military parade celebrating the Workers’ Party meeting, the North put a host of military hardware on display, including a submarine-launched ballistic missile that state media touted as the “world’s most powerful weapon.”</td>

      <td>North Korea sees its nuclear program as essential to regime survival, serving to deter a U.S.-led invasion. Decades of denuclearization talks, economic sanctions and diplomacy have done little to slow Pyongyang’s advance to becoming a self-declared nuclear state.<br />One of the world’s poorest and most-isolated countries, North Korea has managed to stay high on Washington’s list of foreign-policy priorities for years. It spends more on its military, as a ratio of gross domestic product, than any other of the 170 countries tracked by the U.S. State Department.<br />Pyongyang developed its weapons program brazenly, flouting sanctions and breaking promises to halt nuclear production. In 2003 it withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the main global commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.<br />At 2018’s Singapore summit with President Trump, Kim Jong Un greatly boosted his global legitimacy by becoming the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting U.S. leader. In 2017 Pyongyang had ratcheted up tensions with the U.S. to their highest level in years by conducting its sixth nuclear test and firing off three intercontinental ballistic missiles—the last of them showing the range to strike anywhere in the U.S.<br />The U.S. Army in July said North Korea may now have 20 to 60 nuclear bombs and the ability to manufacture six new bombs each year. In October, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic-missile programs remain “a serious threat to the security and stability of the region and the world.”</td>

With more people working from home, some expect less traffic and more space for parks or pedestrianized spaces.<br />Campaigners in Paris, though, have been pressing for years to do something about the Champs-Élysées, named for the Elysian fields, the ancient Greeks’ idea of the afterlife. Some 72% of the estimated 100,000 pedestrians who visit the area each day are tourists, while 22% work there. Only 6% or less are Parisians.</td>

      <td>Medical-gear makers are sharing production information and receiving protection from antitrust scrutiny, the companies and federal officials said, part of government efforts to better coordinate the distribution of N95 masks and other supplies.<br />The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it convened major N95 producers, distributors and buyers last week for a first meeting to discuss the mask supply chain. That group is a subset of nearly 60 companies and trade groups that will share information on production, distribution and pricing for in-demand medical products, FEMA said.<br />The agreement is part of the federal government’s efforts to better coordinate the production and distribution of medical-grade face masks, which have become critical equipment for people treating Covid-19 patients. The effort includes big manufacturers, such as  3M Co.  and  Honeywell  International Inc., both of which have ramped up production of N95s and other protective gear this year. Masks and other gear remain in short supply as Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations hover near peak levels across much of the country.<br />The project is operating under a provision of the Defense Production Act that allows the federal government to consult with businesses for emergency preparedness and response. President Trump invoked that part of the law by executive order in March.<br />The agreement provides participants with protection from potential antitrust lawsuits for cooperating as part of the agreement, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are overseeing the meetings to ensure that the cooperation and data-sharing steers as clear as possible of anticompetitive practices, the group’s agreement states. Companies aren’t typically allowed to hold such detailed discussions about production plans with competitors.</td>

It owns Alipay, a mobile payments and lifestyle app used by more than one billion people in China and that handled more than $17 trillion worth of transactions in the year to June 2020.

      <td>A new way of stock-market wagering is taking hold among younger investors who prefer to think about how much they can spend instead of how many shares they can afford.</td>
      <td>Purchasing a piece of Apple or Tesla once meant calculating how many shares you could afford to buy. That no longer matters. Now you can pay whatever you’re willing to spend, even if that amounts to pocket change.<br />Thinking primarily about dollars instead of shares represents a dramatic shift in the world of personal finance, posing new opportunities and risks for investors. The practice is gaining momentum thanks to the widespread adoption of fractional trading—which allows investors to purchase slivers of traditional shares—as well as an industry push to reduce online trading fees to zero.<br />These twin developments made it easier and more cost effective for new investors to wager as little as $1 on stocks. The volatility of the coronavirus pandemic then turbocharged these bets as market leaders like Apple Inc. and  Tesla Inc.  soared into the hundreds or thousands of dollars. The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up 73% since its intraday low point in March 2020.<br />The lineup of wealth managers catering to dollar-focused investors is spreading from upstart online brokerages that rely on flashy apps to industry stalwarts that have longstanding bricks-and-mortar offices around the U.S. One of those giants, Fidelity Investments, launched a service early in 2020 called Stocks by the Slice allowing investors to purchase fractional shares for the first time. When Stocks by the Slice launched last February, 75% of the buy trades from investors using the service were in dollars on average. This month Fidelity now says that figure is closer to 85%.<br />In the future “retail investors will be thinking 100% in dollars, not in shares,” said Scott Ignall, head of Fidelity’s retail brokerage business. “Clients no longer need to use a calculator to figure out how many shares of stock they want to buy.”</td>

      <td>The pet industry is attractive, but investors need to be choosy as the pandemic adoption boom tails off</td>
      <td>It is hard to leave the house these days without crossing paths with one of Covid-19’s more appealing legacies: the lockdown puppy. Signs that pet ownership increased during the pandemic are positive for stocks like Chewy, but investors can no longer buy any story fronted by a cute animal.<br />Pet brands have become a bright spot for some of the world’s biggest food businesses.  Nestlé ’s  pet-care division was its top performer over the nine months through September, growing sales by 10.6% compared with the same period a year earlier. Sales of  General Mills ’ premium Blue Buffalo brand increased 18% in its latest quarter. Online pet-products retailer Chewy and specialist food producer Freshpet also have experienced strong demand.<br />Globally, the pet-care business probably grew by 7% in 2020, according to an estimate from Euromonitor, which expects annual growth to remain around 6% through 2025. One explanation for the rosy outlook is that the pandemic likely boosted the size of the pet population in key markets.<br />Although the results of annual head counts won’t be available until the spring, global pet-food leader Mars, whose brands include Pedigree and Whiskas, estimates that 85 million U.S. households owned a pet at the beginning of 2020, and that around 11 new million pets were added over the year. British retailer Pets at Home thinks the U.K. pet population may have grown by 2% to 3%.<br />Those numbers might have been stronger but for supply constraints. U.S. shelters were emptied of animals early in the pandemic and breeders struggled to rear enough youngsters to meet demand. A seller’s market pushed up prices. In Britain, a Dachshund puppy could have been purchased for £970 back in March, roughly $1,320 at current exchange rates. By October, when “puppy inflation” peaked, the same dog was more than 70% more expensive, according to animal-welfare charity Dogs Trust.</td>

      <td>Remarks made by key Democratic senators lend oxygen to some progressive wish list items</td>
      <td>READING THE TEA LEAVES on possible major structural changes to Senate rules, statehood for the District of Columbia, and expanding the federal judiciary: Remarks by key Democratic senators in recent days lend oxygen to some progressive wish list items while likely dooming others.  Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told a Buffalo news outlet he was interested in expanding the number of federal district court judges, framing it as a local issue: “There’s a real shortage [of federal judges] in Western New York, and it is one of the things we’ll look at,” Schumer said.<br />Progressive activists would be thrilled, but some, including the group Take Back the Court, continue to press for an expansion of the conservative-majority Supreme Court. In a letter to Biden this week they warn that if his courts commission isn’t supportive of a major overhaul it will “help slam shut the window of opportunity before it is truly open.” Republicans and some Democrats oppose expanding the high court, partly because they believe it would set off a partisan race to keep expanding it further. Biden hasn’t taken a firm position on expanding the court but has called the court system “out of whack” and plans to convene a group of scholars to issue overhaul recommendations within 180 days.<br />Statehood for the District of Columbia and possibly Puerto Rico remains a live issue, though one possible Democratic opponent, Sen. Joe Manchin, said he “wants to see the pros and cons” of that issue. Adding the two states could result in four more Democratic senators. Forty-three Senate Democrats are on the record supporting D.C. statehood, and no other current Democratic senators have said they definitively oppose it.<br />Statehood would likely require eliminating the legislative filibuster, but Manchin and others who oppose that could support a rule change that only eliminated it for statehood votes, like previous rule changes that eliminated the 60-vote threshold for executive branch and judicial nominations.<br />2022 SENATE RACES have already begun, just days after the final contest of the 2020 cycle concluded in Georgia. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman announced a possible run last Friday, and within 72 hours said he had raised over $500,000. He is targeting the seat to be vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. GOP former Rep. Ryan Costello sharply criticized Fetterman’s record and said if he decided to run, he’d “smoke Fetterman in the suburbs.” But that would mean first winning a GOP primary, where Costello’s frequent criticisms of President Trump will test the soon-to-be-former president’s grip on the future of his party.</td>

Through November, China’s actual purchases were about $82 billion, or about 52% of the target goal, according to an analysis by Chad Bown, a senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics.<br />Economists have attributed the shortfall in part to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which dented Chinese domestic demand for foreign goods and lowered the prices of imported energy.<br />The trade pact signed Jan. 15, 2020, also called on China to improve access to its markets to U.S. companies—and on that front, Beijing has made strides, especially with respect to American financial companies.<br />In exchange, the Trump administration agreed to cut tariffs on some imported Chinese products. Still, import duties remain on about $370 billion in Chinese goods annually, affecting most imports.</td>

He was executed at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind., for a killing spree he committed while part of a drug racket, the department said.<br />Earlier Thursday, the high court rejected pleas from Mr. Johnson and Dustin Higgs, the final inmate scheduled to die during the Trump administration, to stay their executions because they were infected with the coronavirus.<br />The court’s three liberal justices, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, voted to grant the stay.<br />Over the objection of Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, the court also denied Mr. Johnson’s separate petition seeking a stay to pursue claims that he was intellectually disabled and, therefore, constitutionally exempt from the death penalty.</td>

      <td>Defense policy move is latest step by administration to shape Middle East agenda for Biden</td>
      <td>President Trump has ordered that the major U.S. military command for the Middle East be expanded to include Israel, in a last-minute reorganization of the American defense structure that pro-Israel groups have long advocated to encourage cooperation against Iran, U.S. officials said Thursday.<br />The move means that the U.S. Central Command would oversee American military policy involving both Israel and Arab nations, a departure from decades of U.S. military command structure put in place because of acrimony between Israel and some of the Pentagon’s Arab allies.<br />It is the latest in a series of Trump administration policy moves to shape the national security agenda President-elect Joe Biden will inherit. The change was recently ordered by Mr. Trump but hasn’t yet been made public. A Biden transition official declined to comment on the move.<br />U.S. military responsibility for Israel had long been allocated to its European command. That arrangement enabled U.S. generals in the Middle East to interact with Arab states without having a close association with Israel, which at the time was seen as an adversary in the Arab world.<br />Following the Abraham Accords that led to the normalization of Israel’s relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, pro-Israel groups have stepped up their push to have the Central Command take on responsibility for military operations and planning involving Israel to foster greater cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department has decided not to restructure the taxpayers’ stake in  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac ,  effectively ending the Trump administration’s push to ensure that the mortgage giants are eventually returned to private hands.<br />The announcement by the Treasury Department and the companies’ federal regulator leaves it to the incoming Biden administration to decide the future of the firms, which were put under government control during the 2008-09 financial crisis through a process known as conservatorship.<br />Advisers close to President-elect Joe Biden have said he would be in no hurry to privatize the companies, which guarantee roughly half of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market. Instead, Mr. Biden would focus on ways to use the companies to boost housing affordability and promote homeownership, the advisers said.<br />Under a more modest agreement announced Thursday by the Treasury Department and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the mortgage companies will be allowed to retain more of their earnings, boosting their ability to absorb potential losses. FHFA is the companies’ independent federal regulator.<br />Thursday’s changes to the companies’ bailout agreements allow the firms to retain roughly $280 billion, or the equivalent of what they are required to maintain as part of new, banklike capital rules set by the FHFA in November.</td>

It has been breached,” using a code that signifies an emergency in which an officer needs assistance.<br />The prosecution’s statement of facts in the case described the fire extinguisher hitting three officers in the head, including one who wasn’t wearing a helmet. Officials said the extinguisher Mr. Sanford allegedly threw isn’t the one that killed Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was also struck in the head with a fire extinguisher during the unrest and died from his wounds, officials said.<br />William Young, one of the officers who was hit in the incident allegedly involving Mr. Sanford, was evaluated at a hospital and cleared to return to duty, the charging document said. A friend of Mr. Sanford tipped off the FBI to his involvement, the document said, adding that he was around 55 years old and had recently retired from the Chester Fire Department.</td>

      <td>President-elect Joe Biden plans to call for a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan to help Americans weather the economic shock of the pandemic and pump more money into testing and vaccine distribution, according to senior incoming Biden administration officials.<br />Mr. Biden in a speech Thursday evening plans to lay out priorities related to the pandemic for the early days of his administration. He will urge Congress to back a round of $1,400-per-person direct payments to most households, a $400-per-week unemployment insurance supplement through September, expanded paid leave and increases in the child tax credit. Aid for households makes up about half of the plan’s cost, with much of the rest going to vaccine distribution and state and local governments.<br />Mr. Biden, a Democrat, is set to take office on Wednesday as the virus death toll has topped 3,000 daily deaths repeatedly in recent weeks and the country deals with the economic fallout from continued business and school closures. The Senate is also expected to hold a trial after the House impeached President Trump for the second time.<br />Mr. Biden wants Congress to act quickly to address what he sees as a national emergency, the officials said. The plan includes some ideas previously floated by congressional Democrats and Mr. Biden’s campaign that Republicans have rejected—including raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour—and it isn’t clear which pieces can become law and how soon lawmakers will act. Most legislation needs 60 votes in the Senate, which would require Republican votes since Democrats will control 50 seats.<br />“We will get right to work to turn President-elect Biden’s vision into legislation that will pass both chambers and be signed into law,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said in a joint statement.</td>

      <td>Her first bills in the new Congress would dilute ballot integrity and make D.C. a state.</td>
      <td>After impeaching Donald Trump again, what do Democrats want to do with their new dominance of Washington? It’s revealing that Speaker Nancy’s Pelosi’s first legislative priority is cementing Democratic political power.<br />Last week House Democrats reintroduced as H.R.1 a voting and campaign-finance bill that would grease the Democratic voting machine nationwide and restrict political opposition. They also introduced a bill to provide statehood for the District of Columbia that would guarantee Democrats two new Senate seats.<br />H.R.1 imposes California-style election rules nationwide. The bill requires every state to register voters based on names in state and federal databases—such as anyone receiving food stamps or who interacts with a state DMV. It mandates same-day and online voter registration, expands mail and early voting, and limits states’ ability to remove voters from rolls. Overall the bill is designed to auto-enroll likely Democratic voters, enhance Democratic turnout, with no concern for ballot integrity.<br />The bill also strips state legislatures of their role in drawing congressional districts, replacing them with commissions that are ostensibly independent. In practice commissions have turned out mostly to favor Democrats, as in New Jersey and California. If states want such commissions, so be it. But this is an attempt to impose one Pelosi standard from coast to coast.<br />H.R.1’s campaign-finance provisions would also limit the political speech of conservatives and Republicans. The bill requires some nonprofits to disclose publicly the names of donors who give more than $10,000, even if those groups aren’t taking part in candidate elections. The left’s pressure groups and media will then stigmatize donors. The bill also raises disclosure requirements for political ads on radio and TV, requiring the head of an organization to approve messages and list the group’s top donors by name.</td>

      <td>We’ve criticized  Twitter  CEO Jack Dorsey’s political speech controls, especially the October blackout of a New York Post story that reflected poorly on the Biden campaign. Many of the impulsive political intrusions by technology companies have done more to embitter American debate than to clean it up. But credit to Mr. Dorsey for at least reflecting on his decisions and the new world the tech titans are creating.<br />In a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday, Mr. Dorsey commented on Twitter’s banning of President Trump, and the crushing of Parler, Twitter’s competitor, in the wake of the Capitol riot. The CEO maintained that his ban on Mr. Trump was necessary but expressed unease about “the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.”<br />That’s when it got interesting. “The check and accountability on this power,” Mr. Dorsey explained, had been that “if folks do not agree with our rules and enforcement, they can simply go to another internet service.” But “this concept was challenged last week when a number of foundational internet providers also decided not to host what they found dangerous.”<br />Some users who chafed at Twitter’s clear left-wing slant amid the election had created accounts on Parler, which didn’t moderate content as aggressively. But then in one weekend Parler was wiped out, first by  Apple  blocking it from its App Store, then by Google doing the same, and then by  Amazon ’s  Web Services withdrawing access to its cloud network.<br />Mr. Dorsey thinks this may be necessary, but conceded that “over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet.” He added that further changes to Twitter “can’t erode a free and open global internet.”</td>

      <td>Mortality keeps falling, but the pandemic may slow progress.</td>
      <td>Ready for some good news for a change? The American Cancer Society reported this week that cancer mortality declined by a record 2.4% in 2018 and 31% since the 1991 peak. Credit better and earlier diagnostics and therapies and a decline in smoking.<br />About 40% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, and the risk increases with age. Cancer is the leading cause of death for middle-aged Americans and two to three times more likely to kill someone in their 50s or 60s than even Covid-19. The incidence of some cancers like breast, liver and kidney is also increasing partly for demographic and lifestyle reasons.<br />The report notes breast cancer is growing by 0.5% annually amid increasing body weights and a declining fertility rate. Obesity increases the risk for breast cancer while pregnancies and breast-feeding lower it. Liver cancer is also on the rise due to obesity, excess alcohol consumption, smoking and hepatitis.<br />Yet overall cancer death rates are falling at an accelerating pace, from about a 1% decline annually in the 1990s to 1.5% in the 2000s and early 2010s to 2.3% from 2016 to 2018. Regular screenings that catch cell mutations and tumors early have helped increase the five-year survival rates for prostate (98%), melanoma (93%), and breast (90%) cancers and made them mostly curable.<br />Lung cancer (21%) is usually caught later due to poor diagnostics, but mortality has still declined by about 5% annually from 2014 to 2018. One reason is fewer people are smoking, and improved treatments like epidermal growth-factor receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitor are able to target non-small cell lung cancer mutations.</td>

      <td>A mail-vote fiasco comes to an end, 70 days after the election.</td>
      <td>Ten weeks, plus a brawl in the state Senate, are what it took to finally settle Pennsylvania’s last election mess of 2020. At issue were some 300 absentee ballots in Allegheny County that voters neglected to date. Were they still valid? If yes, then the Democrat would win a state Senate seat in the 45th District. If no, the Republican would win.<br />The undated ballots were included in the county’s certified results, putting the incumbent Democrat, Jim Brewster, up by 69 votes. Republican challenger Nicole Ziccarelli appealed. If the contested ballots were removed, she said she’d win by 24. At the state Supreme Court, a slim majority said undated ballots are invalid, since the law tells voters to “date and sign.” Yet the tiebreaking Justice, an elected Democrat, held that the rule would apply only “prospectively,” given the tumult of 2020.<br />Ms. Ziccarelli took her case to federal court, pointing out that the 45th District includes parts of Westmoreland County, which did not count undated ballots. She also asked the Senate to reject the certified result: “Ziccarelli has been told by courts, boards, bodies, and state officials that she is right and that some 311 votes cast in her race are invalid, and yet—incredibly—she stands before the Senate with this Petition on the verge of losing because those ballots were tallied against her. This makes no sense.”<br />That was the state of play last week, when the Republican-controlled Senate convened to swear in its new members. In light of Ms. Ziccarelli’s petition and the federal court case, the chamber declined to seat Mr. Brewster, but not without some shouting. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat who presides in the Senate, at first refused to entertain the sidelining of Mr. Brewster.<br />Republicans responded by voting to oust Mr. Fetterman from the chair. “You are breaking the constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth and violating the oath of office you’ve actually taken!” someone yelled. “We will not participate in this farce!” For a time, Mr. Fetterman competed for priority with the GOP’s replacement. “The chair will not cede the rostrum!” he repeated, before eventually giving up.</td>

      <td>The sooner Republicans demystify Donald Trump, the better for them and for the country.</td>
      <td>Liz Cheney’s was a moment of real stature. Standing alone in the well of the House, the third-ranking member of the Republican leadership said, of the events of Jan. 6: “The president of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the president. The president could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.”<br />And so she would vote to impeach. Her remarks implicitly urged others in her party to do so, and the bluntness and power of what she said offered them cover: They could be tough too. But most couldn’t. They were stupid and cowardly.<br />They claimed high-minded concern for the nation’s well-being, but they didn’t seem to believe their own arguments; some rushed through their statements, some gestured wildly as if hoping their arms could convince their brains they were sincere. Impeachment is needlessly divisive. They weren’t concerned about division when they refused to accept the Electoral College result. You’re rushing it. The president’s term is expiring; those who need more time to understand what happened on 1/6 don’t want to understand it. It’s revenge. Revenge has no high purpose and is base. The impeachment consisted of a branch of the American government asserting the country’s standards and the rule of law; an attempt to act decisively against a historic transgression in a way that says, “No more”; an attempt to draw clear and vivid lines for future leaders. To do nothing is to guarantee that it will happen again, that “storming of the Capitol” will become a picture in the minds of the ignorant and unstable as a thing that is possible for them, an option.<br />Ms. Cheney’s stand seemed brought by conviction, and given that she is the only woman in the House Republican leadership, took some guts: She operates within an environment that is dumb, male and clubby. She courted danger by giving them more reason to want to suppress her down the road.<br />They didn’t wait for down the road. Rep. Jim Jordan quickly announced she should be stripped of her leadership position. Others showed up on Hannity to drum up momentum. Having a GOP House leader vote for impeachment is “untenable,” Rep. Matt Gaetz said, showing he knows the word untenable.</td>

      <td>Politicians love direct payments, but people spend more only when long-term income rises.</td>
      <td>President-elect Biden is promising another round of federal spending to “stimulate” the economy. Jumping on the bandwagon for $2,000 checks may be only the beginning. But history shows such spending does nothing to stimulate the economy. In the end, it only adds to the federal debt.<br />Since the mid-1970s, one-time cash payments to individuals to stimulate economic growth have been tried on at least five separate occasions. Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter promised that their stimulus checks would restore economic growth by inducing higher consumption. Yet in both instances the payments failed to deliver the promised results. Their impact on economic output was at best negligible and only temporary.<br />More recent attempts by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama were similar flops. The one-time cash payments under Mr. Bush in early 2008 had no discernible impact on the economy. Having seemingly learned nothing from this experience, Mr. Obama proposed the same remedy in 2009 as part of a larger economic stimulus plan. His temporary and targeted cash assistance had, if anything, only a negligible near-term impact. Over the longer run, the economy experienced a remarkably anemic recovery.<br />These failures are consistent with the permanent-income and life-cycle theories of individual consumption behavior. Both theories suggest that individuals’ consumption is determined primarily by their income over the long term. Hence, a one-time cash assistance grant doesn’t boost consumption. As we wrote on these pages about such programs in 2010, theory and evidence shows that “they did not work then and they are not working now.”<br />Although data are still coming in on the effects of the one-time cash payments authorized by last March’s Cares Act, so far the pattern is the same. Using a large-scale survey of its effects, a National Bureau of Economic Research study by Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Michael Weber found that “most respondents report that they primarily saved or paid down debts with their transfers, with only about 15 percent reporting that they mostly spent it.” Thus the payments have done little to boost the economy.</td>

      <td>After a harsh campaign 40 years ago, Reagan reached out to opponents in his inaugural address.</td>
      <td>As he prepares to address the nation on Inauguration Day, President-elect Joe Biden faces a speechwriting challenge that confronts all new U.S. presidents. How to set out a wholly different path from his predecessor while underscoring the principles that bring Americans together? How to rise above the rancor of the campaign and send signals of hope extending beyond the partisans who cheered him?<br />It was no different when President-elect Ronald Reagan and I sat down on Dec. 16, 1980, to discuss preparations for his remarks. Because of his many years in private life speaking on what he called the “mashed-potatoes circuit,” Reagan enjoyed writing his own speeches. He thought of speechwriters like me as an occupational necessity imposed by schedule limitations. Often as he edited a speech, he would pause, look up and scold: “I remember when I did this all by my lonesome.” Still, as candidate and president, he appreciated not having to start with a blank page.<br />The 1980 campaign between Reagan and President Jimmy Carter was at times very bitter. Reagan punched hard at Mr. Carter’s dismal economic record, with inflation approaching annualized rates of 13%, prime interest rates over 14%, and home mortgage rates over 13%. That season’s unemployment rate of 7.5% had thrown millions out of work, and consumer prices in the Carter years had risen at punishing double-digit annual rates. Our foreign and defense policies had weakened, symbolized by the 52 Americans held hostage in Iran for more than a year. When Mr. Carter sought to place blame elsewhere, Reagan repeatedly ridiculed him as having a campaign symbol of a “finger pointing in the other direction.”<br />On the other side, the president’s team reminded voters of the film “Bedtime for Bonzo” to portray Reagan as a lightweight B-movie actor who would be lost without cue cards—too inexperienced to handle Soviet dictators and untrustworthy with nuclear weapons. Mr. Carter attached big risks to the Gipper’s economic plans and persistently raised doubts among female voters with suggestions that Reagan was a dark throwback to a old-school misogyny.<br />Yet as we met in Reagan’s Pacific Palisades, Calif., home to consider themes and language for his address, there was no hint of enmity toward Mr. Carter. Just the opposite. Among the first instructions Reagan gave—as recorded in my notes—was to be “careful not to take a crack at the previous administration.” Reagan had a naturally genial disposition, but something else underlay his thinking, and, not unusual for him, it was triggered by his recollection of a 1940s Hollywood film, “Marine Raiders.” He remembered a scene in which Frank McHugh portrayed a World War II soldier under duress in the Pacific and blurted out: “What’s happening to us? We’re Americans.”</td>

      <td>Recontextualize the teachings of Islam to address extremism—and to inspire reform.</td>
      <td>Nearly a generation after 9/11, the world has made little progress in freeing itself from the threat of radical Islam. For every Osama bin Laden or Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the U.S. eliminates, 100 radicals pop up.<br />Horrendous violence has engulfed much of the Islamic world, from the Central Asia through the Middle East to Africa. It also erupts periodically on the streets of London, Paris and New York. As of 2019, Britain’s domestic intelligence agency alone maintained watch lists comprising over 35,000 Islamist terror suspects believed to pose a threat to the U.K.<br />Why is the modern world plagued by Islamic extremism? Why do al Qaeda, Boko Haram and Islamic State display such savagery?<br />As I told the United Nations General Assembly recently, the doctrine, goals and strategy of these extremists can be traced to specific tenets of Islam as historically practiced. Portions of classical Islamic law mandate Islamic supremacy, encourage enmity toward non-Muslims, and require the establishment of a universal Islamic state, or caliphate. ISIS is not an aberration from history.<br />Until the formal abolition of the Ottoman caliphate in 1924, much of the Middle East was governed according to classical Islamic law, or fiqh, which is often conflated with Shariah. The operational assumptions of that caliphate and the classical corpus of Islamic jurisprudence by which it was governed have remained deeply embedded in Muslim societies. Even when not enshrined in statutory law, classical tenets retain considerable religious authority and social legitimacy, shaping the prevailing Muslim mind-set.</td>

      <td>Corporations’ new political role carries serious political and legal consequences.</td>
      <td>Corporate America took a big step this week, moving from captives of wokeness to active accomplices. The legal and political consequences may prove profound.<br />Big Business over the past four years has increasingly signed up for leftist politics. Some of this was “wokewashing,” peddling causes or figures for brand benefit—think  Nike ’s  Colin Kaepernick commercial or Lacoste’s replacement of its crocodile logo with endangered species. Some was spinelessness, caving in to the liberal mob—think  Goldman Sachs ’s  refusal to finance fossil-fuel projects. Some was strategic— Twitter  and  Facebook  attempting to ward off regulation with ever-changing policies on “misinformation.”<br />But the events of last week—the assault on the Capitol and the Democratic Senate takeover—inspired corporate America to take on a new role. Business titans are positioning themselves as arbiters of political speech and activity—by withholding essential services to conservative individuals, companies and groups. They’ve turned themselves into political entities, raising constitutional and antitrust questions.<br />This goes way beyond Big Tech’s censoring of Donald Trump and Parler. Twitter, Facebook,  Apple ,  Google and  Amazon  entered the fray by deploying a bogus rationale for banning the president from the biggest social-media sites, then dismantling the only effective conservative alternative. This alone raises free-speech concerns.<br />The bum’s rush that followed put in bright focus the extraordinary power corporate America holds to shut down a political figure, even a party, completely. SnapChat, Twitch and YouTube also disabled Trump accounts, creating a near-total media silencing. Campaign Monitor, an email service provider, confirmed it had suspended Trump campaign emails. Stripe Inc., one of the largest processors of online financial transactions, said it won’t process contributions to the Trump campaign.  Shopify  took offline stores run by Trump entities. In a week, the nation’s C-suites disabled the president’s ability to speak to the nation and communicate with donors.</td>

      <td>The British general should have fallen back, but pride made retreat unpalatable. Instead he rolled the dice even as the Americans gathered strength.</td>
      <td>It may seem counterintuitive, but 18th-century generals tried to avoid battle. They thought that their aims would be better met by maneuver than direct confrontation. According to the French commander Marshal Saxe, the risk of combat outweighed the likely return. Saratoga, one of the century’s most decisive battles, seems to confirm this view. In June 1777, the British undertook what they hoped would be a decisive march into New York to crush the rebellious Americans. They emerged with a humiliating defeat.<br />Many accounts present Saratoga as an epic story, played out in picturesque yet hard terrain. In “The Compleat Victory,” Kevin Weddle, a professor at the U.S. Army War College, conveys the battle’s drama but also turns a critical eye on the ways in which strategy shaped operations in the field. He highlights as well the role of military commanders, not least the firmness of their grip on their troops and on events. The leaders of the Continental Army, Mr. Weddle argues, had a better grip on the Saratoga campaign than their British counterparts, and a better strategy.<br />Upstate New York seems distant from the main theater of the Revolutionary War, but it proved pivotal. British generals inevitably drew on the experience in the Seven Years’ War (1756-63)—that is, the French and Indian War on the North American continent. Thus they focused on the Hudson River-Lake Champlain corridor. This tract of land—what Indians had long called “the great warpath”—offered a natural line to split the colonies. To seize it, it was calculated, British forces could be brought down from Canada and sent up the Hudson River.<br />The Americans, for their part, had captured Fort Ticonderoga in 1775—on the southern reaches of Lake Champlain—and then moved to bring Quebec into the revolution. But the invasion of Canada failed, and the British relief force sent to Quebec—under the direction of Gen. John Burgoyne—seemed to give the British a chance to strike back. The cabinet minister directing the war in London judged that a counter-strike would complement British operations around New York City. In late 1776, as we all know, the British had captured the city with ease under Gen. William Howe, driving Gen. George Washington across the Delaware River.<br />Mr. Weddle deftly recounts Britain’s deliberations at this key point. Burgoyne returned to London bearing a report from Quebec’s governor, a report that he revised into a detailed plan for attack. His proposal to launch a campaign to take Albany, in upstate New York, won approval, along with his call for a supporting force to the west. But Howe, in the southern theater, had a different plan: He secured permission to strike at Philadelphia and draw Gen. Washington into a decisive battle for the seat of the Continental Congress. Instead of a joint operation along the Hudson River, the British had two separate campaigns, neither supporting the other.</td>

      <td>Makan Delrahim says policy makers may want to toughen rules for mergers, competition in the tech space</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has presided over a tumultuous time for the enforcement of U.S. competition law.<br />Appointed by President Trump in 2017, Mr. Delrahim’s tenure began with a sweeping loss: a court rejection of his division’s challenge to  AT&T Inc.’s  acquisition of Time Warner, a case clouded by the president’s repeated criticisms of the deal. He finishes with a win, as  Visa Inc.  this week walked away from a $5.3 billion deal to buy an up-and-coming fintech firm after the Justice Department challenged it using a progressive legal theory about protecting future competition in the online-payments space.<br />Those bookends highlight a tenure in which Mr. Delrahim at times sometimes bucked expectations. The AT&T and Visa cases were aggressive enforcement actions that light-touch Republicans of earlier administrations likely wouldn’t have embraced. He also built internal momentum for the Justice Department’s examination of dominant tech companies. But he took a decidedly conservative approach on some matters, including by allowing  T-Mobile US Inc.  and Sprint Corp. to merge after the Obama administration wouldn’t. Mr. Delrahim also faced allegations that some of the department’s antitrust work was politicized in the Trump era, claims he denies.<br />“We were appropriately tough,” Mr. Delrahim said Wednesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal ahead of his departure next week.<br />Amid a debate about whether current U.S. antitrust law sufficiently protects competition—as well as consumers—Mr. Delrahim said there is merit to some legislative proposals for strengthening enforcement. It would be reasonable, he said, for Congress to place more of a legal burden on companies with 50% or greater market share to prove that their future acquisitions in that market wouldn’t harm consumers.</td>

      <td>A young Indian man climbs the social ladder in Ramin Bahrani’s epic adaptation of the award-winning novel by Aravind Adiga.</td>
      <td>Movies being what they are, complicated commercial enterprises that can go wrong as readily as right, it’s best to keep one’s expectations of a new film in check—even when, or especially when, the source material carries a special cachet. That’s the principle I applied to “The White Tiger,” which is playing in select theaters and will go on Netflix starting Jan. 22.<br />The director, Ramin Bahrani, had done a remarkable little feature called “99 Homes” five years ago. And he adapted this screenplay from the Aravind Adiga novel of the same name, a bestseller that won the Man Booker Prize when it was published in 2008. All well and good, though no guarantee that a film based on a celebrated literary tale of ambition and class struggle in a globalizing India would appeal to American audiences. But then there was no reason to expect much from “Slumdog Millionaire.” While Mr. Bahrani’s film shares certain themes with Danny Boyle’s international hit, it’s a great entertainment in its own right, a zestful epic blessed with rapier wit, casually dazzling dialogue, gorgeous cinematography (by Paolo Carnera) and, at the center of it all, a sensational star turn by an actor, singer and songwriter named Adarsh Gourav.<br />He plays the low-born Balram, an infinitely ambitious, conspicuously gifted young man from an impoverished village, and something of a student of caste. Balram sees it as a system in which men with big bellies, i.e. the masters, lord it over men with small bellies, i.e. the servants; he aspires to the greater girth. The hero also views Indian society as a rooster coop from which he must escape by becoming an entrepreneur, even if it means putting up with a degree of servitude in the process. To that end he smiles, inveigles and fibs his way into a job as a driver for a loathsome family of landlords who keep his village poor. Then he hurriedly learns to drive—from a wild-eyed instructor who turns out to be another philosopher of social mobility. “The road is a jungle,” the man tells Balram. “A good driver must roar to get ahead on it.”<br />The problem in writing about “The White Tiger” is the temptation to quote so many of its pungent lines and terrific jokes that there’s no space left for describing the film, let alone giving the filmmakers their due. Balram narrates his own saga with infectious elation. He has scruples, but he keeps them under control. Mr. Gourav’s range of feelings and moods is like an elite athlete’s range of motion. He pulls off the impressive feat of portraying his character as a shameless liar, sycophant, obsequious self-promoter and besmircher of family honor while making him intensely likable until, as Balram warns toward the end, “my story gets much darker from here.” (The title refers to a rare animal supposedly born only once in a generation. Balram comes to see himself as just such an exotic creature, forgetting that white tigers can end up in cages too.)<br />There’s a lot more to the movie than a rogue’s celebration of his ascent through society’s ranks. The narrative scheme serves as a pretext for political as well as personal comment. From an entrepreneurial perch to which he has risen in 2010, Balram notices that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao will be arriving on a state visit to meet a group if Indian entrepreneurs, and then decides, with charming grandiosity, that he will have to be part of the gathering. In advance of the visit he offers Wen a tutorial on Indian society, with special emphasis on his nation’s cherished pieties and choice hypocrisies, all of it couched in chummy terms. “America is so yesterday,” he says. “India and China are so tomorrow.”</td>

      <td>New administration threatens industrialized world’s highest tax rate on business.</td>
      <td>On Thursday night President-elect Joe Biden will describe some of his plans for multitrillion-dollar spending increases. Before long he’ll also tell us about his tax increases. And they aren’t going to be small. A new report from the Tax Foundation says the Biden plan would impose the industrialized world’s highest income tax rate on business. Research from around the world says that wouldn’t be kind to workers, either.<br />As for tonight’s spending preview, Mr. Biden will take the stage as America has already accumulated its largest debt burden since the era of World War II. Ten months ago, when politicians of both parties were talking about shutting down much of the economy for a few weeks to stop the virus, they enacted a massive $2.2 trillion emergency spending plan. Taxpayers might not have guessed at the time that the historic spending blowout was only getting started. As taxpayers consider the new Biden burdens described on Thursday night, they will notice that the mission is creeping well beyond virus response.<br />Jim Tankersleywrites in the New York Times:<br />Team Biden is thinking of two big pieces of legislation. The first one will be funded entirely with borrowed money, at a time when publicly held Treasury debt is already approaching $22 trillion. A Journal report suggests that the initial bill will require another $1.9 trillion in federal borrowing. As for the other bill, Mr. Tankersley writes:<br />Team Biden isn’t saying exactly how large the expansion of federal spending and taxation will be, but if the tax hikes are anything like the ones candidate Biden threatened on the campaign trail, the economic costs could be significant. Taylor LaJoie and Elke Asen of the Tax Foundation report that the integrated tax rate on corporate income under the Biden proposal would be even higher than during the Obama era and in fact the highest in the entire industrialized world.</td>

      <td>Malcolm X, Cassius Clay, Sam Cooke and Jim Brown spar and spark at a critical moment in each of their lives in this compelling fantasy directed by Regina King.</td>
      <td>Before the title of “One Night in Miami” has even rolled up on screen, director Regina King has defined the four mythic characters about to engage in an impromptu summit at a fleabag Olympus in Jim Crow-era Florida. The prizefighter, the pop star, the pro-football player, the prophet. Each is a historic figure; each is at a crossroads. Metaphorically, their intersection can be viewed as the scene of a four-way collision of worldviews taking place inside the head of Black American Manhood itself.<br />That’s certainly the intent of the play by Kemp Powers, first staged in 2013 and the basis for Ms. King’s inspired interpretation. It imagines what might have happened on the night of Feb. 25, 1964, following the brash, 22-year-old Cassius Clay’s defeat of Sonny Liston for the world heavyweight championship. Since no victory was expected, no victory party was planned. Instead, Clay (Eli Goree) and a couple of friends—the NFL’s Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge) and the singer Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.)—join Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir) in his room at the Hampton House for a little ice cream, and no small amount of debate over who they are, what they mean and what, as a result, they are obliged to do.<br />Mr. Kemp’s work of imagination, which he adapted for the screen, resonates profoundly now. And it couldn’t possibly have been written then: After more than 50 years, the real-life models for his characters have attained the kind of status that obscures how controversial, and in some cases loathed, they were in 1964, and at what a critical juncture each man found himself. Clay, who before the end of the story will come to be known as Muhammad Ali, will defeat Liston, but not before displaying an Achilles heel: In his previous fight, of June 1963, he gets distracted by his own clowning and as a result is, and was, flattened by the Englishman Henry Cooper (and, off-screen, is, and was, saved by the bell).<br />Meanwhile, “King of Soul” Cooke has just signed a five-year management deal with Allen Klein (of Beatles notoriety). But when he plays the very mainstream Copacabana, he flops. Jim Brown, one of the greatest runners in professional football, is about to chuck it all for the movies (“The Dirty Dozen” is three years away). And Malcolm X? History says his break with the Nation of Islam was already under way, but for dramatic purposes Mr. Kemp positions him on the eve of that fatal separation.<br />“One Night in Miami” is the kind of fiction that flirts with fact, though not too shamelessly. The men were all acquainted. As Les and Tamara Payne write in their recent biography “The Dead Are Arising,” the only known vacation Malcolm and his wife, Betty Shabazz, ever took together was to the Clay training camp in Miami the month before the Liston fight. Cooke and Ali can be seen together on YouTube; Mr. Brown knew Ali well before 1964. But the dynamic in the room isn’t entirely brotherly. Malcolm has gotten them together partly to proselytize to Cooke and Brown, partly to grease the wheels for Clay’s announcement of his conversion to Islam and partly to worry about the future, in the company of men he trusts. A fearsome Fruit of Islam sentry (Lance Reddick) haunts their door throughout the evening, and while Brown, Cooke and Clay are disappointed with the lack of conventional victory-night accessories (namely liquor and women) there is real fear in Malcolm—well-justified, as it turns out: He’ll be murdered within a year. (Cooke, too, would be dead by then, in an unrelated killing that remains mysterious.)</td>

      <td>In Switzerland’s affecting Oscar entry, a playwright strengthens the bonds with her dying twin.</td>
      <td>The quiet wonder of “My Little Sister,” Switzerland’s Oscar entry, is its cumulative effect. There’s nothing spectacular about this film, which was written and directed by Stéphanie Chuat and Véronique Reymond, apart from the Alpine scenery and one heart-stopper of a parasailing sequence. And nothing extraordinary about the plot, though marital complications around the edges might, in the hands of less gifted filmmakers, have distracted from the center of a story about Lisa (Nina Hoss), a celebrated playwright afflicted by writer’s block, and her twin brother, Sven (Lars Eidinger), a famous actor who is dying of leukemia. Still, every moment strengthens the essence of the drama—the bond of love between two people who came out of their mother’s womb within seconds of one another. (For playdates in physical and virtual theaters go to filmmovement.com/my-little-sister.)<br />There’s a geographical complication too. Berlin is where Lisa and Sven grew up and made their reputations, and where Sven has been in the hospital. But Lisa is tied to Switzerland, where her husband, Martin (Jens Albinus), serves as headmaster in an expensive and pretentious international school. (The school’s grand piano is supposedly the one Stravinsky used to compose “The Rite of Spring.”) What’s more, Sven needs home care and it isn’t’ available in Berlin, since the siblings’ screwy mother, Kathy (the veteran Swiss actress Marthe Keller), is a far cry from Florence Nightingale: “I can’t stand seeing you waste away like this!” she tells her desperately ill son. So Sven joins his sister in a postcard-pretty area near Montreux, though the action shifts back and forth as his circumstances change.<br />His work circumstances, as well as his medical condition—Sven has his heart set on making one last appearance as Hamlet in a Berlin stage production directed by Lisa’s ex-husband. Complications, as I said, but also opportunities for both stars to give riveting performances.<br />Of the two, Mr. Eidinger is less well known outside Europe, but he’s a revelation in a role without emotional boundaries. Sven is frantic, febrile, mercurial, occasionally unhinged, wildly funny, startlingly smart; he claims to know every word of “Hamlet” by heart, and you believe him.<br />It’s tempting to call Ms. Hoss a known quantity; she’s always in demand and was seen most recently as a music teacher in 2019’s “The Audition.” But you never know what she’s going to do, and how she does it so powerfully is a continuing mystery. Many stars are more classically beautiful, although her beauty, like the gravity of her demeanor, is deepening as she ages. One thing she does with distinctive focus is watch, as well as listen; her watchful presence in a scene intensifies the presence of those around her.</td>

      <td>An intimate 2018 adaptation that makes Chekhov’s quintessentially Russian play feel contemporary; a conventional production from 1973 of the Shakespearean tragedy starring a young James Earl Jones.</td>
      <td>Sometimes you have to dig to find the best theatrical webcasts, while others are hiding in plain sight. Before the pandemic, WNET, New York’s PBS affiliate, used to telecast plays from Manhattan at irregular intervals. And some of its strongest offerings are still online for free on-demand viewing—if you know where to look.<br />One place, tucked deep within the thirteen.org website, is a page devoted to Channel 13’s “Theater Close-Up” series of off-Broadway productions. The most recent episode, one of the greatest Chekhov productions I’ve ever had the privilege to review, is the 2018 New York premiere of Richard Nelson’s adaptation of “Uncle Vanya,” the auspicious inaugural production of Hunter College’s Hunter Theater Project, in which professional stagings are mounted under the aegis of the Upper East Side school’s drama department. This concise “Vanya,” which was taped in front of a live and responsive audience, was performed in casual street clothes and modern English (Mr. Nelson, who was also the director, translated Chekhov’s play in collaboration with Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky). The goal in the theater was to make everything more intimate, with 12 area mikes used to boost the volume just enough so that the actors could throw away their lines and still be heard in every corner of the small black-box house.<br />Not only did it work there, but viewing it on a laptop with earphones proves to be just as successful, so much so that I can enthusiastically recommend this “Vanya” to Chekhov novices and connoisseurs alike. (I brought a friend who had never seen a Chekhov play to see Mr. Nelson’s version two years ago, and it made a deep and permanent impression on her.) Like so many of Chekhov’s dramas, “Vanya” is a tale of regret made more poignant by being partly played for wry laughs. The seven characters are a group of melancholy men and women mired in the quicksand of provincial country living who enact the quintessentially Russian story of suddenly realizing that they’ve frittered away their lives. Such terrible tales are best told both with a smile and in an understated way, and Mr. Nelson’s actors hardly ever raise their voices, whether figuratively or literally. Instead, they let you listen in as they watch the sun set forever on their bleak little world.<br />Jay O. Sanders, one of New York’s most admired character actors, is the star of the show this time, scoring a decisive triumph in the title role, that of a quietly disappointed man settling unhappily into middle age who longs “to wake up on a bright, quiet morning and feel…that all the past was forgotten, scattered like smoke.” Not that his fellow cast members are other than consistently fine—far from it—but Mr. Sanders is breathtakingly right as Chekhov’s feckless, pitiable failure, a “shining light who never shone on anybody” and now knows he never will. As for the translation, it’s simple, speakable and ideally suited to Mr. Nelson’s dramatic purposes, and his staging, which transfers naturally to the small screen, never gets between you and the play. (If you don’t recognize it, “Someday Soon,” the haunting quasi-theme song, is by Elizabeth and the Catapult.)<br />Another noteworthy show that I recently ran across, available on WNET’s “All Arts” streaming platform, is an extreme rarity, a telecast of the 1973 Shakespeare in the Park outdoor production of “King Lear” directed by Edwin Sherin and starring James Earl Jones, Paul Sorvino and Raúl Juliá. Mr. Jones was not yet known as the resplendent bass voice of Darth Vader in 1973. Back then he was a distinguished stage actor who made occasional screen appearances (he had a small part in “Dr. Strangelove” and got a best-actor Oscar nomination for ‘The Great White Hope,” in which he had previously appeared on Broadway).</td>

      <td>What kind of movies will the pandemic inspire? How will the drama of Covid-19 be told? A harbinger has arrived, but it doesn’t amount to much. In normal times “Locked Down,” streaming on HBO Max, wouldn’t amount to anything, except for one monologue that fills three minutes and has nothing to do with viruses. Still, the film, directed by Doug Liman, was shot—in a mere 18 days—during the plague, which does in fact figure in the plot, and it’s the first one I’ve seen in which a number of people, none of them playing gangsters or the Lone Ranger, are wearing masks.<br />Masks do not figure in the plot as political statements, only as face coverings, since the action is set in London—mostly inside a flat shared by Linda, a corporate executive played by Anne Hathaway, and Paxton, a security-van driver played by Chiwetel Ejiofor. She has recently dumped him but, thanks to the lockdown, he has no place to go. That’s a perfectly good premise for a sophisticated romantic comedy, and all the more so because they continue to care for each other, even though she’s tightly wound and often insufferable while he’s a career underachiever running on the last fumes of his self-esteem. But sophistication isn’t on the agenda. After a succession of clumsy, unfunny Zoom conferences and much mawkish philosophizing by Paxton—“a complete re-examination of one’s life does seem to be a Covid side effect,” he says—the film turns into an action adventure involving a jewel heist at the landmark department store Harrods, where Linda had worked before her current gig.<br />The rationale for this excursion into “Rififi” territory is that the caper will be easy to pull off, given that Linda knows all the secrets of the security system and the store has been shut down by the lockdown. That makes sense, but it also makes for a very long climactic sequence of sub-negligible suspense, when little or nothing seems to be at stake.<br />“Locked Down” is a puzzlement in one respect. The screenwriter was Steven Knight, who, several years ago, wrote and directed the elegantly crafted “Locke,” an essentially one-character drama starring Tom Hardy and set almost entirely in the surpassingly close quarters of a BMW SUV. Maybe the slapdash quality of “Locked Down” simply reflects the filmmakers’ desire to be early to market with a Covid feature. But that three-minute monologue is something else. It’s delivered brilliantly by Ms. Hathaway, an operatic aria with no need of music in which Linda talks, with mounting passion, increasing speed and glorious goofiness, of emerging markets and facilitators and a crazymaking meeting in Paris, and all of it by way of explaining to Paxton why she’s started to smoke again.<br />Watching movies at home has its drawbacks, beginning with, as I’ve said so many times, relatively small screens. One advantage, though, is that you can watch what you want when you want. If you want to watch that three-minute smoking speech and skip everything else, it starts 30 minutes and 30 seconds after the film has begun.</td>

      <td>Starring Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany, the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s foray into old-time TV gets the genre right, but not much else.</td>
      <td>Even those viewers fully indoctrinated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its intersecting adventures, rococo mythologies and legion of superheroes may be confused by “WandaVision.” They’ll be wondering, among other things, why the characters themselves aren’t more visibly confused: If you found yourself in a postmodern remake of “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” not knowing how you got there or why, wouldn’t you discuss it with your spouse? If only to get your stories straight?<br />“WandaVision” finds Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), the lethal prestidigitator—aka Scarlet Witch—of various Marvel movies, and her similarly credentialed “synthezoid” husband, Vision (Paul Bettany), trapped in the world of ’60s sitcoms. At least they seem to be trapped. As of “Avengers: Endgame” Vision actually seemed to be dead. So the entirety of “WandaVision” could be a dream born of grief, taking place under Wanda’s Breck Girl hairdo.<br />At any rate, the befuddled couple seem to know who they are, but not whose lives they’re inhabiting, though the answer seems to be the Andersons, Ricardos and Petries (“Father Knows Best,” “I Love Lucy” and “Dick Van Dyke”). Their world at the outset is black and white. They have theme music. The era is late-’50s/early ’60s, although by episode 2 the presiding aesthetic is that of “Bewitched” (1964-72) and by episode 3 color has arrived, along with allusions to “The Brady Bunch” (1969-74). Like Vision, things move quickly, including a surprise pregnancy. Occasionally, a regularly scheduled radio program is interrupted by a squawking voice pleading through the static: “Who’s doing this to you, Wanda? Can you read me?”<br />“WandaVision” marks the so-called MCU’s entry into episodic TV—previous Marvel shows have been outside the MCU corporate umbrella—and only three episodes were made available for review. Which is a shame: Not until the end of episode 3 do matters seem poised to coalesce, and up till then “WandaVision” is a crashing bore.<br />The plot points are a Whitman’s Sampler of sitcom clichés deftly disinterred and tweaked—the forgotten anniversary, the dinner with the boss, the nasty neighbor lady who must be appeased. The writing is freakishly accurate in capturing the period humor, or lack thereof—Jac Schaeffer, the show’s creator, is also credited as lead writer, and she has perfect pitch for the kind of almost-funny gag lines that infested so many ’60s-’70s sitcoms and needed a laugh track to push them over the line into vaguely amusing. As an exercise in cloning, it’s all morbidly fascinating: The re-creations of the various classic shows and their styles display both a knowledge of and deep affection for old-time TV; the shooting styles, fashions and palettes are dead-on and the incremental changes taking place in ’60s society are reflected just the way they were in Big Three network prime-time programming.</td>

Mr. Biden’s advisers have said they intend to limit U.S. dependence on Chinese technology, but the incoming team hasn’t laid out specific policies.<br />“The rules are reasonable,” said a senior administration official, who added that he thought the incoming administration “will see the need for them.”  A Biden spokesman declined comment.<br />Along with China, Commerce named Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and the Maduro government of Venezuela as foreign adversaries. Shipments of communications hardware, software and other gear from those nations could be blocked under the new rules as posing a national-security risk.<br />Under the proposal, Commerce would have 180 days decide whether  to allow the sales or require modifications of a transaction.</td>

According to a recent court filing, 611 children—some of whom were separated during an earlier pilot program—still haven’t been reunited with their parents.<br />President Trump ended the policy through an executive order on June 20 amid intense bipartisan blowback and global condemnation.<br />Though many of the outlines of the report’s findings have been previously reported in the media, the inspector general report is an official summation of the pressures and lack of planning that led to the long-term separation of thousands of families, many of whom said they were fleeing violence and poverty in Central America and coming to the U.S. to request humanitarian protection.</td>

One week after he had been on the House floor when a violent mob stormed the Capitol, he voted to impeach, joining nine other House Republicans to side with Democrats in the 232-197 tally.<br />“I spent the last couple of days looking at what happened that day and what the president was doing while it was happening,” Mr. Rice said in an interview Thursday. “And the more I looked at it, the madder I got.”<br />Widely seen as the most surprising of the GOP votes to impeach Mr. Trump, Mr. Rice represents a safely Republican district in South Carolina that includes Myrtle Beach, and he has rarely broken with the party or the president. Now, Mr. Rice faces political blowback at home, but he says he felt compelled to vote against Mr. Trump.</td>

That better-than-targeted IPO price valued the company at more than $3 billion, up from a $1.25 billion valuation in 2019.<br />Proceeds from the IPO will be used in part to fund Poshmark’s growth strategy, which includes expanding into new product categories. Founder and Chief Executive Manish Chandra said in a Thursday interview that expansion will be guided by the needs of its seller community, and with an eye toward appealing to its broadening audience.<br />“We think of our platform as really something that is universally applicable,” Mr. Chandra said. He added, “Our sellers today span 98% of the ZIP Codes in the United States and really span all of the different age demographics. We’ve also diversified where we’re starting to be increasingly appealing to not just women, but also men.”<br />Private companies have been looking to cash in on robust demand from investors for new listings. Companies raised more than $167 billion on U.S. exchanges last year through Dec. 24, compared with the full-year record for funds raised through IPOs in 1999, during the dot-com boom, according to Dealogic.</td>

A Wall Street Journal survey of forecasters this month projected the U.S. economy will grow 4.3% this year and the unemployment rate will drop from 6.7% in December to 5.3% by the end of this year.<br />“Now is not the time to be talking about exit” from easy money policies, Mr. Powell said in a webcast with Princeton University, his undergraduate alma mater, adding, “The economy is far from our goals.” In addition to high unemployment, he noted, inflation isn’t clearly on a path to reaching 2% on a sustained basis, even though it might spurt higher this year.<br />The Fed has pushed short-term interest rates to near zero and signaled it expects to keep them there for years. It also has been buying $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgages bonds, net of redemptions, every month since June and committed to continue doing that until it sees “substantial further progress” in the job market.<br />The central bank’s next policy meeting is Jan. 26-27 and little change is expected in policy or communication.</td>

Completed just 10 days after its formal comment period ended—unusually quickly in the slow world of federal rule writing—the measure from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may be challenged by banks, which say it micromanages credit decisions.<br />The Biden administration may also seek to overturn the rule using a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act.<br />Mr. Brooks, who is stepping down as acting Comptroller of the Currency later Thursday in the final days of the Trump administration, said in an interview that the rule revolves around the same concept of nondiscrimination requirements in lending. Banks can still deny services to individuals or businesses, but they must justify their decisions quantitatively and objectively, he said.<br />“This is just a nondiscrimination principle,” he said. “If you’re not going to serve somebody for a service that you have chosen to offer to others…then you have to do the homework and show why this person is risky.”</td>

      <td>MILLIONS OF American and other foreign tourists are flocking to Mexico, but they’re drawn by more than warm weather, beaches and cultural and culinary abundance. Mexico has been liberal about admitting tourists without proof of negative Covid tests or quarantine requirements at a time when places from New York to Europe to Asia have blocked or restricted pandemic travel.<br />Though it offers travelers a respite from cold and monotony, Mexico’s policy holds risks for foreigners and locals alike. Over the past week, Mexico has registered an average of nearly 13,000 Covid cases and almost 1,000 deaths a day from the virus, or about 107 deaths per 100,000 people. (By comparison, the U.S. reports 116.35 deaths per 100,000 and the U.K. 125.35 per 100,000). Evidence suggests that Mexico’s figures are undercounted. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns against travel to Mexico due to Covid and the U.S. State Department urges “increased caution in Mexico due to crime and kidnapping.” (Starting on Jan. 26, the U.S. government will require all international airline passengers to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test before boarding flights to the U.S., presenting a new hurdle for Americans arriving back from Mexico, which conducts relatively little testing.)<br />But so far, the warnings haven’t stopped people from coming. In December, Laura Hartman, a Manhattan dental-practice manager, traveled with her husband to the same all-inclusive Cozumel resort she’s been visiting annually for about eight years to scuba dive. While Ms. Hartman said she didn’t feel at risk, she noted some differences: fewer fellow guests, the closure of Cozumel’s annual Christmas fair, the ubiquitous protective masks on staff, and the absence of the giant cruise ships that normally crowd the coast. “That was the strangest thing on the landscape,” said Ms. Hartman, 56. “It was just sad. Mexico’s a poor country and without tourism [many local workers] can barely survive.”<br />The major cruise-ship companies, which canceled sailings to Mexico and elsewhere in March, hope to restart this year with testing for all passengers and crew before boarding, limited capacity and other curbs, according to their industry association.<br />About 25 million tourists visited Mexico in 2020, a 43% drop from the previous year, with the biggest decline happening in April. Arrivals and hotel occupancy rates have both gradually edged up since then. Cancún, whose airport received the most tourists in 2020, is again among  Expedia ’s  most-searched destinations for 2021, along with other Caribbean beach resorts. Among them is Tulum, which hosted thousands of people for its Art With Me cultural festival in November. Paul Sarfati, founder of Bamba Travel, a Mexico City-based international tour operator, said a small hotel he owns with partners in Tulum has been nearly full, even in the normally slow period of September through November. “They’re partying there like there’s no Covid,” he said.</td>

He was only 54 years old at the time. He was one of the best football coaches on the planet. And he had a history of saying he was done only to quickly change his mind: He had stepped down as the head coach at Florida in 2009 only to come back months later and resign after the next season. Less than a year later, he came back again to coach Ohio State.<br />Now Urban Meyer is nearing another comeback—this time as the coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars.<br />It isn’t exactly surprising Meyer looks like he’s returning to the sidelines. What’s surprising is the place he chose. He’s betting the next stage of a career rich with championships on a franchise that has never won a Super Bowl and had the NFL’s worst record in 2020.</td>

This makes it the second-most shorted company across the New York Stock Exchange and  Nasdaq Inc.,  according to Dow Jones Market Data. That had some Reddit users predicting that the stock might rapidly rise if short sellers suddenly had to cover their bets by buying back shares should the stock suddenly rise in value.<br />This week, that forecast finally appeared to take shape after news of changes to GameStop’s board sent shares climbing.<br />On Monday, the company said it had struck a deal to add  Chewy  Inc.  co-founder Ryan Cohen and two former executives to the GameStop board.</td>

      <td>The incitement case against him isn’t just the use of a few words he uttered before the assault by his followers on the Capitol but the conduct over an extended period leading up to his rally.</td>
      <td>Jeffrey Scott Shapiro’s recollections (“No, Trump Isn’t Guilty Of Incitement,” op-ed Jan. 11) of his own prior prosecutorial involvement with allegations of incitement are undoubtedly correct, but he ignores one significant distinguishing factor: He never had to deal with Donald Trump. The incitement case against him isn’t just the use of a few words he uttered before the assault by his followers on the Capitol but the conduct over an extended period leading up to his rally before the assault on the Capitol.<br />Context matters. President Trump had repetitively falsely stated, as he did again at his rally on Jan. 6, that the electoral results were fraudulent and that he (and therefore his followers) had been robbed of a legitimately elected presidency. He had urged his followers to come to Washington on Jan. 6 for a “wild” day. At the Trump rally itself, his lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, called on his followers to engage in “trial by combat,” and the president himself called on his followers to accompany him to the Capitol to combat the supposed “election theft” that he was “not going to let . . . happen” and for them “to show strength,” and “to be strong.” And as his supporters yelled out “fight for Trump,” his response was “we will not take it anymore . . . we will stop the steal.”<br />All this is the equivalent of waving a flock of red flags before a bull. The Supreme Court has admirably defined incitement narrowly to avoid stifling free speech, but like Mr. Shapiro it has never had an incitement case involving Donald Trump or Trump-like speech before it. We may yet hear from the court.<br />Floyd Abrams<br />New York</td>

      <td>Sen. Tom Cotton (“Insurrection Demands Forceful Response,” op-ed, Jan. 8) is right when he says: “The best way to maintain or restore order is an overwhelming display of force, which often can prevent the use of force.“ However, he only alludes to an important issue when he deprecates the initial unarmed deployment of the National Guard.<br />There is a reason we arm our police. While the presence of an officer often deters illegal behavior, that presence is backed by the implicit threat of loss of life, liberty or treasure for those not conforming their behavior to civic norms. When peaceful demonstrations become riots, as defined by violence and the destruction of property, lethal force is justified.<br />A police officer facing a rioter wielding a brick or a baseball bat has reason to fear great bodily harm or death, and therefore has the right of self-defense to use lethal force. A person hurling a Molotov cocktail into a police station is, at the very least, showing depraved indifference to the lives of those inside, if not homicidal intent. He should be deterred by lethal force.<br />As Sen. Cotton points out, maintaining order is necessary “not only to protect . . . people from criminal violence but also to preserve confidence in civilization.” The surrender of a police station in Portland, Ore., taught the insurrectionists in Washington, D.C., that they could act with impunity. Our civilization needs the protection of lethal force.<br />John M. Peterson</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden intends to select Jaime Harrison, a former Senate candidate in South Carolina and a rising star in the party, to lead the Democratic National Committee, people familiar with the plans said Thursday.<br />Mr. Harrison, a former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, raised $133 million for his unsuccessful 2020 bid against Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.). As DNC chair, he will be tasked with helping the party defend gubernatorial candidates and protect its House and Senate majorities in next year’s midterm elections.<br />Mr. Harrison’s selection to lead the DNC, first reported by the New York Times, was expected to be announced later Thursday. One of the people familiar with the plans said Mr. Biden intended to install three allies as DNC vice chairs: Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Rep. Filemon Vela (D., Texas). Another person familiar with the plans said he also intends to tap Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D., Ill.) as a vice chair.<br />New presidents typically choose the leadership of the party committee. Mr. Harrison sought the chairmanship of the DNC in 2017 at the start of the Trump administration, but DNC members chose former Labor Secretary Tom Perez.<br />Party officials noted that Mr. Biden’s campaign worked closely with the DNC during the campaign and expected Mr. Harrison’s selection to enhance that partnership. Mr. Biden has long maintained ties to South Carolina, and voters in the state were instrumental in his comeback during the 2020 primaries.</td>

      <td>Chip giant’s next leader brings engineering background, Christian faith to company confronting array of challenges</td>
      <td>Intel Corp.’s  incoming Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger once described himself as the chip giant’s “chief geek”—a role he might need to resume as he seeks to revive the company’s prospects and rebuild its technological prowess.<br />The 59-year-old is both an obvious choice to lead America’s most iconic semiconductor company—he spent 30 years there earlier in his career—and a somewhat unorthodox appointment for a modern chief executive who wrote a book on work-life balance and developed a points system to help himself avoid staying late at the office.<br />Intel on Wednesday named the Pennsylvania-farm-boy-turned-engineer to succeed ousted CEO Bob Swan next month. The appointment marks a turning point for Intel as it battles market-share losses and weighs its strategic direction, including whether to remain both a designer and maker of chips when most rivals have specialized in one or the other.<br />Mr. Gelsinger brings the kind of engineering background common at Intel, one of Silicon Valley’s pillars. Mr. Swan, a former financial chief, was only the second CEO in the company’s 52-year history not to have a technical background. He remains in his role until Feb. 15.<br />François Piednoël, a former Intel engineer who has criticized the company’s technical decisions and whose career at the chip maker overlapped with Mr. Gelsinger’s, called the new chief a good listener who understood technical problems and made informed decisions. “He is very good at building his confidence by seeking the experts’ opinions,” he said.</td>

      <td>Startups around the country are looking to lighten the burden on landfills by offering takeout in reusable containers. Will consumers get on board?</td>
      <td>LIKE MOST New Yorkers, Adam Farbiarz relies on restaurant takeout. But he doesn’t like all the packaging that comes with it.<br />Most of us simply sigh over the waste and move on. But in late 2019, Mr. Farbiarz and two partners launched DeliverZero, an online platform that lets customers order from restaurants that offer reusable containers, then return them to the delivery person the next time they order. The network began with five restaurants, all in Mr. Farbiarz’s Brooklyn neighborhood. A year later, the company had 120 restaurants throughout New York City and a backlog waiting to join.<br />DeliverZero is one of a number of startups that have set out to tackle restaurant waste. The boomlet is happening mostly in eco-conscious cities including San Francisco, Portland, Ore., and Durham, N.C. But Loop, a refillable packaging initiative from the recycling company TerraCycle, is launching pilots this year with chains such as  McDonald’s  in the U.K., Tim Hortons in Canada and Burger King in the U.S.<br />The efforts reflect a growing awareness among consumers about the problem of waste, in particular, plastics. According to the Overbrook Foundation, which supports organizations devoted to environmental conservation, 561 billion disposable items are used each year in the U.S. Meanwhile, the EPA reports that only 8.5% of plastic is recycled. And that was before the pandemic.<br />Stay-at-home orders—along with federal guidance to restaurants to use disposable plates and packaging—have only intensified the problem. Waste numbers for 2020 are not yet available, but the market for U.S. food delivery in 2020 is expected to add up to $44 billion, a nearly 42% jump over 2019. It’s a safe bet that millions of extra takeout containers have hit the trash. “The problem is so in your face,” Mr. Farbiarz said. “Every time you order, you get all this garbage.”</td>

Cisco disputed that claim and sued Acacia in Delaware Chancery Court to compel the Maynard, Mass.-based company to close the transaction under its previous terms.<br />A spokeswoman for Cisco said the company plans to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit Thursday.<br />Acacia executives said on a call Monday that since the initial agreement was announced, the company has benefited from stronger demand from some customer groups as well as improvements in its product portfolio and relationships with existing customers.

      <td>Carnival’s investors headed for the lifeboats, but this company is more buoyant than it looks.<br />The cruise line released preliminary fourth-quarter results on Monday that did little to resuscitate its tattered share price. The company said it expects to post a loss of more than $2 billion for the quarter as it burned through an average of $500 million in cash a month.<br />Carnival Corp.’s shares are now down nearly 58% over the last 12 months, making it the worst performer of the three major cruise lines over that period. At this price, investors should play the long game. Carnival said on Monday that bookings for the first half of 2022 were ahead of those in the same period of 2019, indicating that demand can return to at least pre-pandemic levels. Carnival will be there to welcome cruisers on board: It said that it ended 2020 with $9.5 billion in cash and that it has enough liquidity in place to sustain its business even if it generates zero revenue this year.<br />Diving deeper into its booking numbers, the recovery looks even better. Carnival’s total capacity for 2022 relative to 2019 will grow by less than 2%, net of ships disposed of and acquired, according to UBS analyst Robin Farley. And Carnival said that 2019 was a very strong year with bookings at the higher end of its historical ranges, making for an especially tough comparison.<br />Cruise-review site Cruise Critic, owned by Tripadvisor, says it has seen a 40% increase in cruise shoppers on its site this month thus far compared with last month. January marks the start of a three-month period those in the industry refer to as “wave season,” when cruise lines traditionally offer deals to encourage early bookings. Carnival also said that, as of Nov. 30, about 45% of its guests affected by schedule changes opted to receive future cruise credits rather than refunds. At least some of that committed occupancy wouldn’t have shown up yet as actual bookings.</td>

      <td>The suspense of OPEC and its partners’ strained meeting has been resolved, but there is still room for surprise from two countries outside that group</td>
      <td>Saudi Arabia’s decision to dramatically cut its oil output was a pleasant New Year’s surprise for energy investors. Developments in the world’s two largest economies could cut the party short.<br />The kingdom’s move has helped send front-month Brent crude oil prices up by 7% in two weeks to above $55 a barrel. The cut erases a substantial 1 million barrels a day of supply—about 1% of world demand—in February and March, as the market still faces uncertain oil demand with surging Covid-19 cases.<br />The operating assumption is that any drag on demand will be short-lived and that other producers remain chastened by 2020’s price crash. A report released by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Thursday is encouraging: After reducing its 2021 oil demand forecast in the past four consecutive reports, the latest one kept its December estimate. It expects demand to increase by 5.9 million barrels a day from 2020 to average 95.9 million barrels a day. It has also kept its oil supply forecast largely unchanged.<br />But wild cards still remain in the form of two formidable oil players: the U.S. and China. They are crude oil’s largest consumers and the former was the largest producer of oil in 2019, topping Saudi Arabia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.<br />OPEC notes in its report that market conditions have improved for U.S. shale drillers, yet the cartel revised its U.S. supply forecast up by only 0.1 million barrels a day. The actual number could well swing higher. Plenty of U.S. companies have signaled discipline. Experience has shown, though, that those promises are hard to keep when oil prices are high and capital markets are friendly. A broad basket of energy exploration companies has gained almost 22% this year and interest rates remain very low.  Goldman Sachs ,   Morgan Stanley  and other brokers have upgraded their ratings on  Exxon Mobil ,  for example.</td>

But his parting infliction of chaos is the most illuminating.<br />The key is to understand the nature of President Trump’s offense, and precisely why the Senate may yet find it difficult to convict him for it despite Wednesday’s impeachment in the House. The offense for which he is almost certainly impeachable was the speech he gave the day of the Capitol Hill riot that incited a mob to obstruct Congress’s deliberations.<br />This must be the closest a president has ever come to the sort of infraction the Founders had in mind when they wrote the impeachment clause. Much of their political thought was stimulated by the English Civil War of the 1640s, sparked by Parliament’s attempts to defend its privileges against King Charles I (whose head parliamentarians ultimately claimed). That conflict between crown and Parliament has preoccupied English-language political philosophy ever since. Less time separated America’s founding generation from those events than now stands between us and the founding.<br />But what will Congress do about it? The Founders provided for political impeachment and conviction as the remedies for a dangerous executive. But to work, the mechanism requires a legislative branch deeply invested in and jealous of its powers and prepared to go to the political mat to defend them.<br />No wonder the current impeachment drive may falter, since today’s Congress is anything but protective of its unique institutional role. The House speaker who pushed forward impeachment this week is the same Nancy Pelosi who famously admitted in 2010 that Congress would have to pass the Affordable Care Act “so you can find out what’s in it.” Whatever figurative point she thought she was making, the statement was literally true: Most of what Congress did was hand executive agencies vague instructions to write new regulations, the full content of which would be as much of a surprise to legislators as anyone else.</td>

      <td>William Burns will rein in intelligence with an outsider’s touch.</td>
      <td>President-elect Biden has selected veteran diplomat William Burns as his nominee for director of the Central Intelligence Agency. This is a good choice—an experienced and highly respected national-security expert. He will be an asset to Mr. Biden and could help restore bipartisan confidence in the agency he leads.<br />I write as a 19-year CIA veteran and a supporter of President Trump. I’m critical of Mr. Biden’s other picks for top national-security posts, most of who are unremarkable former Obama officials. But Mr. Burns served for 33 years in the Foreign Service and eventually was ambassador to Russia and deputy secretary of state. He also was a trusted aide to several secretaries of state in Republican and Democratic administrations. He has written critically of President Trump and his foreign policy, but he has avoided the harsh anti-Trump partisanship of many career national security officials over the past four years.<br />With the selection of Mr. Burns, Mr. Biden shined light on two key issues in the national-security world. First, to be truly accountable to the American people and the president, the CIA needs to be led by an outsider. Although many CIA officers will be disappointed that one of their own didn’t get the nod, Mr. Burns is well-known by the CIA workforce and will be well received.<br />Second, Mr. Biden and his advisers appear to recognize that the intelligence community has lost public trust after years of politicizing intelligence, meddling in domestic politics, and violating the electronic privacy of Americans. The so-called whistleblower who initiated Mr. Trump’s impeachment in 2019, and the continuous spiteful criticism of Mr. Trump by former CIA Director John Brennan, undermined the agency’s reputation as a nonpartisan institution. This was no time to reward a Biden insider with the agency’s top job.<br />The CIA needs a housecleaning to perform as a less political, more effective intelligence organization. I don’t know how much leeway the Biden White House will give Mr. Burns to hire and fire throughout the agency’s ranks, but I believe he will press his boss to allow him to make several long-overdue organizational reforms.</td>

But other antitrust agencies are continuing to scrutinize the transaction, including in the U.S., meaning Google’s decision to move forward isn’t without regulatory risk.<br />“This deal has always been about devices, not data, and we’ve been clear since the beginning that we will protect Fitbit users’ privacy,” Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president for devices and services, said Thursday.<br />To appease EU regulators, Google pledged not to use Fitbit data for advertising purposes in Europe and to store such data separate from any other Google data used in ads.<br />It also told regulators it would allow users to link their Fitbit data to competing apps and committed to allowing wearable-device makers open access to functions of Google’s Android operating system.</td>

      <td>Covid-19 aid, confirming nominees are also on agenda as new administration kicks off</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate trial in the second impeachment of President Trump is set to bleed into the beginning of President-elect Joe Biden’s term, throwing a wrench into the busy agenda Democrats plan to tackle in the coming weeks and testing Republicans’ loyalty to Mr. Trump.<br />The Senate won’t return to Washington until Jan. 19, the day before Mr. Biden’s inauguration, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) rebuffed a Democratic push to immediately reconvene the body and begin the trial, in the wake of the impeachment of Mr. Trump on Wednesday. While Mr. McConnell has signaled he is open to convicting Mr. Trump for his statements before last week’s attack on the Capitol, he said the trial won’t conclude until after Mr. Trump leaves office.<br />“Even if the Senate process were to begin this week and move promptly, no final verdict would be reached until after President Trump had left office,” Mr. McConnell said Wednesday.<br />An impeachment trial for the outgoing president at the beginning of Mr. Biden’s term will create a logistical challenge for Democrats, who will take control of the Senate and seek to quickly confirm Mr. Biden’s nominees and pass another coronavirus relief bill. Last year’s trial in the first impeachment of Mr. Trump took several weeks, requiring senators to sit in their desks on the chamber’s floor, often until late into the night.<br />“I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation,” Mr. Biden said Wednesday.</td>

      <td>Lineup extends many selling points of previous launches, but base model sells for $200 less than last year’s version</td>
      <td>SEOUL— Samsung Electronics Co. ’s newest smartphones feature improved cameras, display functions for weary eyes and stylus compatibility.<br />But as global smartphone sales are projected to return to pre-coronavirus levels this year, the industry is trying to answer if the pandemic-weathered consumer will be satisfied with incremental improvements in technology and features. Samsung is betting the answer is yes.<br />The South Korean technology company introduced three new models of its Galaxy S21 phones on Thursday, hoping to gain ground on its sanctions-hobbled rival Huawei Technologies Co. and lift weaker sales of its flagship phones as global demand sputters back.<br />The most novel feature in Samsung’s new offerings may be the price: The base model Galaxy S21 model will retail for $799, or $200 cheaper than last year’s version. The S21+ will cost $999, followed by the top-of-the-line S21 Ultra at $1,199.<br />The smartphone market is still recuperating from the economic fallout of the pandemic, which briefly closed retail stores and caused people to delay buying new devices, analysts say. That helped push the average length of time consumers owned their smartphone to around three years, according to market-tracking firm Strategy Analytics, and overall smartphone sales slumped 20% in the first half of 2020.</td>

      <td>In a Seattle home, a designer brokers a peace between a couple’s warring tastes without compromising style</td>
      <td>I LIKE THINGS that have a little bit of tension,” said interior designer Heidi Caillier. This passion for clashes made her the ideal partner for Jacob Meyer and Margaret Lacy Meyer, a couple with disparate tastes who asked her to help mastermind a renovation of their five-bedroom Craftsman-inflected house in Seattle’s Seward Park neighborhood.<br />Ms. Lacy Meyer, a psychotherapist from Milwaukee, favors clean midcentury modern design and bold accents, coupled with an earthier West Coast palette. “I’m not a traditionalist,” she said. Her chemist husband, born in rural Gibson, La., is drawn to the dark wood and ornament seen in British décor or—closer to home—the 18th-century Georgian aesthetic that was popular in the American South. “He likes a lot going on,” said Ms. Lacy Meyer of her husband’s design preferences.<br />Ms. Caillier first created a base of smoky greens and creams, plenty of warm wood, brushed brass and nubbly natural textiles—elements that could engage either client’s taste. She next layered in traditional elements to meet Mr. Meyer’s love of intricacy halfway—but with a modern twist. The formality of the wainscoting in the living and dining rooms, for example, was undercut with a solid wash of an unorthodox shade, Farrow & Ball’s Red Earth. His wife approved.<br />In decorating other rooms, Ms. Caillier layered furniture and finishes from different eras. In the bedroom of one boy (the family includes three under age 8), whimsical contemporary wallpaper and a bright yellow side table help a heavy Victorian Eastlake bed, which might seem too stodgy for a child of 5, skew youthful. Here, a room-to-room look inside the designer’s playbook.<br />Ms. Caillier smattered Delft-like tiles into the backsplash as a modern take on a classic Dutch look. The hand-painted pieces, by BDDW, actually skew American, with imagery of such Western troublemakers as cowboys, hunters and grizzly bears. Bar stools with molded-walnut seats—very Eames-like—offset more-historic elements, like the Shaker-tinged cabinets. Roman and Williams Guild’s pendants straddle sensibilities: The shape’s a little midcentury, but the rich patina, ribbed collar and form of the glass don’t feel super-modern, said Ms. Caillier.</td>

      <td>In the 18th century, a new Protestant belief that people have control over their destinies fostered the rise of free-market ideas.</td>
      <td>The conventional account of modern thinking about economics starts with Adam Smith’s 1776 book “The Wealth of Nations.” Smith’s insights, in turn, are usually said to be a product of the secularism of the Enlightenment—a historic turn from thinking in terms of a God-centered universe toward ideals of human rationality and self-sufficiency.<br />But that story is seriously incomplete. In fact, our modern Western understanding of market competition as the key to economic progress owes a great deal to religion—specifically, the new ideas that emerged in the English-speaking Protestant world in the late 17th and the 18th century. Critics of capitalism sometimes complain that the belief in competitive markets, among economists and many ordinary citizens too, is a form of religion. There is something to the idea, though not in the way the critics mean.<br />The idea that there is a connection between religion and capitalism isn’t new. The German sociologist Max Weber famously argued that religious belief had been an important spur to the growth of capitalism. Weber pointed in particular to the Calvinist notion of predestination—the belief that God decided whether each individual would be saved or damned before the person was even born. Driven by anxiety over their ultimate fate, Weber theorized, believers sought to convince themselves that they were among God’s “elect” by displaying virtues like thrift, industriousness and individual initiative. In this way, a “Protestant ethic” emerged that enabled the rise of modern capitalism.<br />For purposes of economic thinking, however, Weber had things exactly backward. Belief in predestination actually hindered the emergence of modern capitalism’s key idea—that human beings can rationally advance their own and others’ economic condition. After all, if it was impossible for individuals to make any choice or take any action to promote their ultimate spiritual prospects, how could they make choices or take action to improve their well-being in this world?<br />By Adam Smith’s time, however, Protestant thought had turned away from the idea of predestination. The English and Scottish clergy began to preach instead that men and women are endowed with reason and that human character is inherently good. John Tillotson, the Archbishop of Canterbury in the late 17th century, argued that far from being predestined to heaven or hell, people can “cooperate” with God in effecting their salvation. As the philosopher John Locke put it in a famous metaphor, people have “the candle of the Lord” by which to see and then act.</td>

      <td>Men’s champion Nathan Chen aims to win his fifth crown, but ladies champion will likely change as Alysa Liu adjusts to a changing body</td>
      <td>Physiologists who study the effects of puberty on athletic performance sometimes suggest that elite performers sit out the season when they’re undergoing a growth spurt, to reduce the risk of injury from high-intensity training or jarred confidence from the pressure of adjusting to a changing body under a spotlight.<br />Alysa Liu, the 15-year-old 2019 and 2020 U.S. ladies figure skating champion anointed by many as the next big American hope, isn’t doing that. But the skating season she’s participating in has been so pared back because of the novel coronavirus that it’s almost as if she did.<br />Liu will appear in the contest for the ladies’ national title on Thursday and Friday, with men’s champion Nathan Chen pursuing his fifth crown on Saturday and Sunday. They will perform before cardboard cutouts of fans and canned recordings of applause in the same near-empty arena in Las Vegas where the only other two in-person U.S. national competitions of the season have taken place.<br />It’s also quite possibly the last competitive outing they’ll have before the next season, which happens to include the 2022 Olympic Games. Almost all of the international competitive calendar has been shredded.<br />Only the hosts of the 2021 world championships, scheduled for Stockholm, Sweden in March, insist they’re still going ahead, but they haven’t described their plans for making the event safe yet. Some countries may balk at sending their skaters, even though technically it’s a qualification opportunity for the Games.</td>
