      <td>Tuesday’s confrontations underscore rise in violence in underfunded prisons</td>
      <td>Dozens of Ecuadorean inmates were killed Tuesday in a bloody confrontation between rival gangs in three prisons fighting for control of the facilities, the government said.<br />The riots broke out in a prison in the coastal city of Guayaquil, as well as in two others in the provinces of Cotopaxi and Azuay, said Edmundo Moncayo, the head of Ecuador’s penitentiary agency. At least 62 prisoners were killed, he said, in the country’s worst such violence in recent memory.<br />President Lenin Moreno said that 800 police officers were sent to regain control and that the military was deployed outside the prisons. About 20 police officers were injured, authorities said.<br />Latin America’s notoriously overcrowded prisons are hotbeds for deadly riots and bloody fights between gangs. Violent gangs from Mexico to Colombia and Brazil often battle for control inside prisons, which they use to orchestrate drug trafficking and other criminal activities on the outside.<br />In Ecuador, Tuesday’s violence, which inmates recorded with cellphones, rattled a nation that has seen an increase in prison violence in recent years.</td>

      <td>Other nations have expressed frustration with Facebook’s tradition of not paying for news posted to its platform</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.’s  battle with publishers and regulators around the world over how the social-media giant handles news is far from finished after striking an agreement this week with the Australian government to pay for content.<br />The agreement Facebook reached Tuesday with Australia’s government to restore news content to its platform comes as political leaders elsewhere have pledged to increase scrutiny on tech giants, and as news outlets also plan to amp up pressure on the company to cut deals. The matter also raises questions about which publishers should get paid for news content and how much.<br />Facebook’s deal with Australia gives it a path to avoid required payments to publishers for news content, so long as the company works toward reaching agreements with publishers on its own accord.<br />“We appreciate the government has created flexibility to move forward making deals with publishers, while giving us 30 days’ notice before a designation,” said Campbell Brown, Facebook’s vice president of global news partnerships. If Facebook’s negotiations with individual Australian publishers fail to satisfy the government, the company could reimpose its news ban rather than be forced to comply with the new law’s terms for setting payments.<br />“I am hopeful there will not be a need for that step,” Ms. Brown said.</td>

      <td>Two House Democrats from California, Reps. Anna Eshoo and Jerry McNerney, launched a frontal assault on the First Amendment this week with a letter to the CEOs of communications companies demanding to know what they are doing to police unwelcome speech.<br />A Journal editorial notes that “the letter is a demand for more ideological censorship.” The two legislators write: “Our country’s public discourse is plagued by misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories, and lies.”<br />But it’s clear that they only want to discipline one side. The Democrats claim, “Experts have noted that the right-wing media ecosystem is “much more susceptible...to disinformation, lies, and half-truths.”<br />The “experts” quoted are three Harvard academics, and the lead author is law professor Yochai Benkler. His take on “right-wing” media is perhaps not surprising given that according to the OpenSecrets website he donates exclusively to left-wing politicians, especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.).<br />In any case, Mr. Benkler has assembled an interdisciplinary team at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society and purports to have discovered data showing that conservative media is bad.</td>

The bill will then go to the Senate, where approval is almost guaranteed, said Senate Majority Leader Ricardo Monreal.</td>

      <td>Biden’s regulators are ignoring the electrical grid’s vulnerability.</td>
      <td>You’d think the Texas blackouts would trigger some soul-searching about the vulnerability of America’s electrical grid. Not in today’s hothouse of climate politics. The Biden Administration is already moving to stop an examination of grid vulnerability to promote unreliable renewable energy sources.<br />Regulators have been warning for years that the grid is becoming shakier as cheap natural gas and heavily subsidized renewables replace steady coal and nuclear baseload power. “The nation’s power grid will be stressed in ways never before experienced” due to “an unprecedented resource-mix change,” the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in 2011.<br />It added: “Environmental regulations are shown to be the number one risk to reliability over the next one to five years.” But the Obama Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC) refused to consider how climate policies would affect reliability. Since 2011 about 90 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity have shut down, replaced by some 120 GW of wind and solar and 60 GW of gas power capacity.<br />But renewables don’t generate power around-the-clock as gas, nuclear and coal do. Gas plants depend on just-in-time fuel deliveries, which aren’t reliable in extreme weather. Government-made pipeline bottlenecks constrain deliveries in the Northeast. Liberals also say Texas could have better weathered the Arctic blast if its grid didn’t rely almost entirely on in-state power.<br />But the Southwest Power Pool, north of Texas, and the Midwest power grid—both of which rely heavily on wind backed by gas—also experienced power outages last week due to declining surging demand, wind production and gas shortages. California relies on gas and imports to back up its solar power. But last summer California couldn’t get enough power from its neighbors amid a heat wave that strained the entire Western grid. Hydropower from the Northwest and coal from Utah couldn’t stop blackouts.</td>

      <td>A new journal from students who refuse to be cancelled.</td>
      <td>Most college administrators are no doubt exhausted by constant student demands that range from the type of cereal served in the dining hall to the latest intersectional fad. So those running the University of Chicago must be pleasantly surprised by the arrival of Chicago Thinker on their campus this school year. It’s an online journal by conservative and libertarian students who refuse to be canceled.<br />Their mission statement makes the point: “We demand not to be coddled. Embracing the experience of unfettered inquiry and free expression is precisely the point of these years of intense study: to rigorously confront and challenge our most deeply-held beliefs—and to emerge from the experience as more thoughtful, informed human beings.”<br />They build on a firm foundation. In 2015 the university released a statement reaffirming its commitment to “free, robust, and uninhibited debate and deliberation.” In 2016 the university’s incoming freshman received a letter informing them that “we do not support so-called trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial and we do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.”<br />The Chicago Thinker’s latest posts include stories on the “insane COVID rules and snitch culture” at today’s universities, a definition of conservatism offered “in defiance of egregious caricatures,” and a piece on “how leftism ruined ‘Stargirl,’” a superhero TV series based on the character from DC Comics. Good for the Chicago Thinker—and even more for the university that promises never to coddle the students running the publication.</td>

Grid failures will only become more common as the left continues to sabotage America’s No. 1 power source.<br />Prior to starting graduate school, I worked as an engineer on natural-gas pipelines in Texas. I saw how a radical, antiscience faction on the political left does everything in its power to make building, operating and maintaining gas pipelines prohibitively difficult. Pandering to these activists and voters, Democratic leaders impede natural-gas projects through punitive regulations, endless reviews and flat-out refusals to approve new projects. Ironically, those quickest to blame natural gas for this current crisis in Texas are the ones who have worked the hardest to create barriers to the improvement, modernization and expansion of America’s pipelines.</td>

Mr. Prude died in a hospital seven days later.<br />The Monroe County Office of the Medical Examiner ruled Mr. Prude’s death a homicide.

      <td>Gov. Lamont makes a smart decision to base eligibility on age.</td>
      <td>‘I’m going to focus on the old business motto, KISS: Keep it simple, stupid.” That’s how Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont put it Monday in announcing his decision to base Covid-19 vaccine eligibility strictly on age. The more states prioritize social “equity,” the more complicated and inequitable vaccine distribution becomes.<br />After seniors older than age 65, Connecticut had planned to vaccinate “essential workers” and younger people with underlying health conditions like diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended these groups be prioritized to “mitigate health inequities” and “promote justice.” Younger minorities are more likely to be “essential workers” and have comorbidities.<br />But as Mr. Lamont explained, “A lot of complications result from states that tried to finely slice the salami and it got very complicated to administer. . . The CDC said grocery and food service workers [get priority]. Then we started getting calls of, ‘I’m not in a grocery [store] but I’m in a convenience store and it’s a convenience store that serves . . . we have doughnuts, we have coffee, we have food.’ How about, ‘I’m a big box store, but I also have food; I think we should all be prioritized as well.’ . . . Those are the type of questions we had. And it was very difficult.”<br />Or how about people a few pounds short of the public-health definition of obesity? If they ate more doughnuts, could they qualify?<br />The Democratic Governor is right that complexity is the enemy of speed. It’s also the enemy of equity. Decisions about who is or isn’t an “essential worker” are arbitrary. Many people in their early 60s are retired, including large numbers of public-safety workers.</td>

      <td>Investigators are trying to understand interplay between broken fan blades and engine cowling, which was ripped away</td>
      <td>The midair breakdown of a jet engine that spewed a trail of metal over a Colorado town is putting regulatory focus on the design and strength of engine coverings.<br />Four minutes into the Honolulu-bound United Airlines flight from Denver on Saturday, pilots and passengers heard a loud bang, and the plane’s right engine began vibrating, according to the National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary analysis of the cockpit’s voice recorder. Within 20 minutes, the plane had landed on the runway back at Denver International Airport, with no injuries to anyone on the ground or aboard the plane.<br />However, large pieces of debris plunged from the sky, landing in yards and a soccer field. Photos and videos taken by passengers show the airplane’s right engine, stripped of its front coverings, oscillating and in flames.<br />Investigators have homed in on a fan blade that had weakened over time and broke off at its base. That fast-spinning blade remnant appears to have sheared a second blade roughly in half. But investigators are still trying to understand why the engine’s front external cover, known as the cowling, was then ripped away, according to NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt. Something similar happened in a handful of other engine failures caused by broken fan blades in recent years.<br />“Certainly, we don’t expect the cowling to separate like that,” Mr. Sumwalt said this week, during a briefing with reporters. He added that the safety board’s investigators would examine the engine’s maintenance and inspection records.</td>

      <td>Stories of decline, reform and survival in a post-Fukushima Japan already hobbled by economic stagnation and an aging society.</td>
      <td>Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, Japan was buffeted by crises. Economic stagnation left the country with dim prospects. An aging society compounded the problem. Younger Japanese barely remember the era of wealth that catapulted their nation to the world’s No. 2 position.<br />Nature struck an even deeper blow to the country’s psyche. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake occurred off the northeastern coast of Honshu, triggering a devastating tsunami. More than a quarter million people were displaced and nearly 20,000 were killed. A meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant followed. The world watched in horror as the greater Tokyo area, with a population of 38 million, seemed at risk. The Japanese people averted that nightmare, but 10 years later the trauma of what could have been still lingers.<br />In “Every Human Intention: Japan in the New Century,” American journalist Dreux Richard offers an eclectic collage of stories about Japan in the decade since the earthquake. Three complex dilemmas organize Mr. Richard’s idea of Japan: decline, diaspora (or immigration) and reform.<br />The strongest in the series are the stories from Japan’s increasingly depopulated rural towns. Mr. Richard visits the port city of Wakkanai, on the northernmost tip of the country. Once a thriving economy, Wakkanai has declined as the region’s fishing stock was depleted and trade with the nearby Russian island of Sakhalin evaporated. Mr. Richard presents a rich array of voices to capture the city’s public-policy challenges as well as the plight of its elderly. Efforts at revitalization are regularly rebuffed. “I’m annoyed by the notion that people in Wakkanai should feel chastened,” laments the city’s former mayor, Yokota Kōichi, “that a city in decline should dare nothing.”<br />To explore the difficulties faced by Japan’s African immigrants—which officially number almost 22,000 but are estimated to be up to twice that with visa overstayers—Mr. Richard relies mostly on Prosper Anyalechi, a permanent resident from Nigeria who has been in Tokyo since 1991, to tell his own story. Expectations for Mr. Richard’s insights ought to be high, as the author reported extensively on the subject for the Japan Times newspaper between 2011 and 2016. According to Mr. Richard, few African migrants have more than a tenuous claim to a home in Japan; most live in isolation away from the society that hosts them. They have limited access to legal visas, and many who seek opportunity there end up staying beyond the term of their permits.</td>

      <td>All people are created equal, but Congress is considering a bill that would make some people more equal than others.<br />H.R. 5, styled the Equality Act, would redefine “sex” under federal civil-rights laws to include “sexual orientation” and “gender identity,” overriding basic biology along with millennia of tradition.<br />This isn’t only a question of semantics. Nor is it merely an attempt to prohibit employment discrimination against sexual minorities. A 2020 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court already does that.<br />The Equality Act would go much further by making it illegal to distinguish “identity” from biology and thereby prioritize transgender people over women. By erasing sex as a distinct legal category, the measure threatens to open up female-only spaces and opportunities designed to increase representation for girls to biological men, which can endanger the safety of women and girls.<br />The Equality Act would threaten the existence of women’s prisons, public-school girls’ locker rooms, and women’s and girls’ sports teams. It would limit freedom of speech, freedom of association, accurate data collection, and scientific inquiry. It would threaten the rights of physicians who doubt the wisdom of performing life-changing, reproduction-limiting procedures, and parents who seek to protect their minor children from such treatment.</td>

      <td>The ex-senator had said he might seek the Republican nomination</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Former Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia said he wouldn’t seek a return to the Senate in 2022, one week after announcing he was exploring a bid and filing early paperwork to do so.<br />“After much prayer and reflection, Bonnie and I have decided that we will not enter the race for the United States Senate in Georgia in 2022. This is a personal decision, not a political one,” Mr. Perdue said in an email to supporters Tuesday, referring to his wife. “I am confident that whoever wins the Republican primary next year will defeat the Democrat candidate in the general election for this seat, and I will do everything I can to make that happen.”<br />Mr. Perdue lost a runoff race for re-election in January to his Democratic opponent, now-Sen. Jon Ossoff. The runoff was needed because, in Georgia, statewide officials must win more than 50% of the vote—a threshold no Senate candidate cleared in November.<br />In his statement, Mr. Perdue said that he would work with Georgia officials to “correct the inequities in our state laws and election rules.” Top state election officials, many of whom are Republicans, have said the November elections and subsequent runoffs were conducted fairly.<br />The announcement came after Mr. Perdue said last week that he would consider running for the seat now held by Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who defeated Republican Kelly Loeffler in a different runoff last month. Mr. Warnock must run again because his race was a special election to fill the remainder of a term vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson, who retired due to illness. Mr. Ossoff was elected to a full, six-year term.</td>

      <td>Macron and Merkel respond coolly to Biden, and public opinion backs them.</td>
      <td>President Biden set out to declare a triumphant U.S. return to the trans-Atlantic alliance. “America is back,” the president said in his speech this week to the Munich Security Conference. The leaders of France and Germany promptly made it clear that the four years of the Trump presidency had changed the relationship.<br />France’s President Emmanuel Macron renewed his call for Europe’s “strategic autonomy,” which would require the Continent to be prepared to defend itself. Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel bluntly stated that the interests of the U.S. and Europe wouldn’t always converge, which most listeners took as a reference to the European Union’s recent trade pact with China, along with Germany’s determination to complete the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline from Russia. The U.S. may be back, but it can’t expect to reclaim its old seat at the head of the table.<br />Underlying the muted response to Mr. Biden’s speech is what the European Council on Foreign Relations calls a “massive change” in European public opinion toward the U.S. The group’s recent poll finds: “Majorities in key member states now think the US political system is broken, that China will be more powerful than the US within a decade, and that Europeans cannot rely on the US to defend them.”<br />These beliefs are driving fundamental changes in European policy preferences. “Large numbers think Europeans should invest in their own defense,” the poll found, “and look to Berlin rather than Washington as their most important partner. They want to be tougher with the US on economic issues. And, rather than aligning with Washington, they want their countries to stay neutral in a conflict between the US and Russia or China”—a stance endorsed by at least half the electorate in each of the 11 countries surveyed.<br />In every country except Poland and Hungary, pluralities agreed with the statement that after voting for Donald Trump in 2016, the American people can no longer be trusted. In Germany, a majority endorsed this sentiment.</td>

      <td>Why an antitrust exemption for news outlets is better than Australia’s scheme.</td>
      <td>Hey Australia, the 1830s called and they want their media business model back.<br />It sounds terrible to modern ears, but in the early days of the newspaper industry, the “party press era,” papers were PR organs. Their job was to win elections and capture lucrative government advertising. Australia apparently seeks to create a similar dynamic, albeit with a legal and regulatory cloak thrown over it. Why should we care? Because legislators everywhere are watching closely. They see the same opening to suborn—er, support—a free press made vulnerable by the collapse in digital ad revenues. Our own venerated Sen. Bernie Sanders is among them.<br />Australia’s rationale is disingenuous even by political standards, exploiting the unpopularity of Google and  Facebook  as a foil. No matter how often it is insinuated otherwise, the U.S. internet ad giants do not steal newspaper content; they send millions of readers to newspaper websites every day and help them generate billions of dollars in ad views.<br />The problem is that the advertising these readers see doesn’t pay nearly as well as advertising did in pre-internet days. This isn’t Google’s and Facebook’s fault but Australia’s Parliament nevertheless would put the onus on them to compensate publishers for the fact that their news products, while still valued by readers, no longer are valued quite so highly by advertisers.<br />Google promptly surrendered, recognizing a threat by politicians to dictate its core search results. It agreed to funnel payments to local media owners through a different window, greasing them for participating in a separate project called News Showcase. (The Journal’s publisher is a recipient of such a deal.) This seems to have satisfied the politicians for now.</td>

      <td>“End the violence toward Asians,” said the promotional fliers. “Let’s unite against white nationalism.”<br />Demonstrators gathered in New York on Saturday in the wake of a spate of unprovoked violent attacks on Asian-Americans. Earlier this month, Noel Quintana, a 61-year-old native of Manila, was slashed in the face with a box cutter while commuting to work on a crowded subway car. He survived but required about 100 stitches to close his wounds. Other victims have been less fortunate.<br />In Milwaukee last September, a 36-year-old Hmong American named Ee Lee was sexually assaulted in a city park and died at a hospital from “blunt force trauma to her head.” The suspects fled on bicycles.<br />In San Francisco last month, Vicha Ratanapakdee, 84 and originally from Thailand, was on his regular morning walk when a passerby knocked him to the ground and ran away. Ratanapakdee died from his injuries a few days later. Across the Bay, in Oakland’s Chinatown, police have documented an uptick in assaults, particularly on the elderly. On Jan. 31, a man was caught on camera in separate incidents approaching a 91-year-old man and 55-year-old woman from behind and shoving them to the pavement. The woman lost consciousness.<br />“It’s not unique to Chinatown or to the Asian community, the increase in crime we’ve seen across the city and across the county,” said the district attorney for Alameda County, which includes Oakland, at a news conference earlier this month. “But we have seen in the last several weeks and month a very specific increase in crimes committed against Asians.”</td>

Noting that he had no permit to install the statue, dubbed Charging Bull, the police hauled it away. A few days later, the city allowed the bull to be placed near the northern tip of Bowling Green park, also in Lower Manhattan. “It was just too good to lose,” said Henry Stern, then commissioner of the city’s parks department.<br />Since then, the statue has amused millions of passersby and startled a few. “I don’t like that cow!” wailed one 3-year-old boy upon seeing it in 2003. It has endured attacks by vandals wielding paint and a metal object. In 2010, another artist swaddled the sculpture in a coat made of yarn.<br />Mr. Di Modica died Feb. 19 in his hometown of Vittoria, Italy. He was 80 and had suffered from cancer and other ailments.</td>

The severity of his injuries is not clear at this time. No cause for the crash, in the Rancho Palos Verdes area, was given, and the vehicle in the single-car wreck suffered “major damage,” according to authorities.<br />While the full extent of Woods’s injuries aren’t known, the accident is the latest chapter in a long series of vehicular mishaps that in the past have knocked him off course in his quest to be golf’s greatest player ever.  His first car accident in 2009 kicked off a sex scandal, and eight years later he was found asleep at the wheel with painkillers in his system. These defined the epic downfall of an athlete who experienced a meteoric rise unlike few others, only for him to be back atop the golf world once again when he won the 2019 Masters.<br />Woods, 45 years old, said in January that he had recently undergone back surgery, the latest in a string of ailments that threw arguably the greatest golfer ever off course. He appeared on TV for an interview over the weekend at the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club in the Los Angeles area, which he hosts, though he didn’t say when he would be healthy enough to return. The car that crashed appeared to be a Genesis vehicle.</td>

      <td>LONDON—By the middle of this year, all adults in Britain are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine in what is on course to be the fastest inoculation rollout in a major Western country. But disease modelers advising the U.K. government recently made a sobering projection: 56,000 more Covid-19 deaths by the summer of next year, even if the country tiptoes out of lockdown and the vaccines work.<br />The study points to the uncomfortable prospect that even with an effective vaccine, the virus will continue to take a toll on society and that some restrictions may have to be periodically reintroduced to control the coronavirus’s spread.<br />The conclusion: Businesses and governments around the world need to prepare to live with Covid-19, accepting that the virus won’t disappear but equally that lockdowns cannot go on forever once hospitalizations are brought down to manageable levels.<br />“We cannot escape the fact that lifting lockdown will result in more cases, more hospitalizations and sadly more deaths,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Parliament on Monday as he mapped out a slow and conditional route out of lockdown. “There is therefore no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain or indeed a zero-Covid world.”<br />The caution doesn’t undermine the value of a successful vaccine rollout. New data released Monday showed that Britain’s vaccination program—which has given at least one shot to more than a third of the country’s 53 million adults—has significantly lowered infections and cut serious illness by even more.</td>

      <td>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is proposing a $44.8 billion budget that boosts spending on education, economic-development programs and pension payments, as state revenue collections continue to outperform the dire predictions made at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The governor’s spending plan calls for about $200 million to help jump-start the economy with grants and loans for small businesses and other initiatives and an increase in education spending of more than $600 million. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, also has proposed making a $6.4 billion pension payment for the fiscal year beginning in July, which would be the first full payment to the state’s underfunded retirement system since 1996.<br />In a recorded budget address released Tuesday, Mr. Murphy said the state needs to begin planning for its future beyond the pandemic.<br />“It is the time for us to also lean into the economic policies that will not just get us through the remaining months of the pandemic, but which will supercharge our re-emergence from it and the recovery that awaits on the other side,” said Mr. Murphy, who is up for reelection this year.<br />The Murphy administration will now begin budget talks with leaders in the Democratic-controlled state Legislature. State Sen. Paul Sarlo, the Democratic chairman of the Senate budget and appropriations committee, said Mr. Murphy’s budget plan was a “reasonable proposal that makes use of anticipated resources to address the expected needs of the people of New Jersey.”</td>

      <td>Soleil Moon Frye reprises her role in a reboot of the boundary-breaking sitcom.</td>
      <td>‘Punky Brewster,” the “Punky-Powered” sitcom of the mid-’80s starring the bubbly Soleil Moon Frye, had a relatively brief life on NBC, another in syndication and was the inspiration for a Saturday morning cartoon. The very phrase “Saturday morning cartoon” summons up the kind of nostalgia that Peacock’s rebooted “Punky Brewster” is intended to kindle. Rather than the fragrant recycling effort it actually suggests.<br />This is not the fault of the cast. Ms. Moon Frye—who was 8 years old when she made her debut as Punky—has maintained enough of a presence on various TV series that fans won’t be too shocked that she’s now playing a 40-ish divorced mom of three, living in the spacious Chicago apartment left to her by her adoptive father, Henry (who was played in the original show by George Gaynes; the late actor’s photo occupies a place of honor in the new, Punkified living room). She is a charming presence, and so are the young actors playing her kids—the teenage Hannah (Lauren Lindsey Donzis), the younger Diego (Noah Cottrell) and the even younger and evidently gender-curious Daniel (Oliver De Los Santos). Daniel and Diego are adopted; Hannah seems to be the biological child of Punky and her ex, Travis (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who, like Seinfeld’s neighbor Kramer, is given to barging in unannounced and often at inopportune times. Given that Punky’s resuscitated sex life is to be a recurring part of the storyline, this open-door policy could well lead to situations of the lowly comic and cringe-inducing variety. Likewise, the fact that Hannah and Punky are both dating, and even run into each other one night with their beaus in tow.<br />The overall tone of “Punky Brewster” redux feels like it’s been hidden under someone’s mullet since 1984. What distinguished the show from the competition then and now is the adoption angle, which is a significant one: The original “Punky Brewster” was a landmark of sorts, in that Punky had been abandoned by her mother at a shopping mall and became the first regularly scheduled prime-time network foster child (Henry adopted her in season 2). The new show’s prepubescent wild card, its element of conflict, its chief purveyor of precocious wisecrackery, is Izzy (Quinn Copeland), who has also been abandoned by her mother, and thus worms her way into Punky’s heart and home. Izzy has been the biggest escape artist at Fenster Hall—the same facility from which Henry had to extract Punky after she entered the system back in 1984—and has been under the jurisdiction of social worker Cherie (Cherie Johnson, of the original series), who apparently greases the bureaucratic wheels so Punky can immediately foster Izzy.<br />Unlike the old show, this “Punky Brewster” doesn’t make much out of the hard facts of foster care—it doesn’t make much of a deal at all about the fact that Punky’s mother calls her on the phone at the end of episode 1, after 36 silent years. (Mom goes all but unmentioned for several subsequent episodes.) Punky tells her indignant threesome that they don’t just need to make space for Izzy in their apartment, “you need to make space for her in your hearts.” Everyone groans, including the kids. But in both versions of the show, the catalyst is the relatively rare occurrence of outright child abandonment that situates their characters. The intentions are good—mainstreaming adoption and foster care in pop culture. But the real-life foster-care system is much more concerned with children separated from their parents over alleged negligence or abuse, which is often the result of poverty. It would be interesting to see a show tackle foster care from that angle. This is not that show.<br />It is, instead, a gently comic program in which every episode has a moral and which mines its own past in various ways—Punky’s unbridled color sense and her mismatched sneakers, for instance. But if viewers are looking for a blithe skip down Memory Lane, “Punky Brewster” trips on the untied laces of its pink and orange Converse. The incessant laugh track, for one thing, is a throwback to the general mediocrity of so many network comedies of the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, and is a means of strong-arming giggles out of its more vulnerable and sentimental viewers. It’s difficult to tell whether the dialogue by executive producers Steve and Jim Armogida (“School of Rock,” “Grounded for Life”) is as insipid as it seems or if that laugh track is just throwing things off balance and stifling the rhythm. Much of “Punky Brewster” would be funnier, and perhaps even endearing, if it weren’t trying quite so hard to be both.</td>

      <td>Move by Jair Bolsonaro to place army general atop oil giant seen as meddling in state firm</td>
      <td>SÃO PAULO—The financial future of Brazilian oil giant  Petrobras  hung in the balance Tuesday as its board met to decide whether to approve President Jair Bolsonaro’s controversial appointment of an army general to the company’s helm in an apparent bid to force the firm to subsidize fuel prices.<br />Mr. Bolsonaro’s nomination of Gen. Joaquim Silva e Luna, who served alongside him under Brazil’s 1964-85 dictatorship and has no experience in the oil industry, has roiled markets, wiping billions of dollars off Petrobras’s market value and raising fears about government meddling in the economy.<br />While the board meeting was scheduled to end late Tuesday, people close to the deliberations said the 11 members may delay the decision on whether to back the president’s move or defy him. A delay will only create more uncertainty, analysts said, prompting possible further losses at the company.<br />Petrobras’s shares on Tuesday climbed 8%, recovering some of the ground lost the day before, when they plunged roughly 20%, the second-biggest daily loss in market value since the early 1990s, according to Economatica, a São Paulo-based analysis firm. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stocks index rose 2% by Tuesday afternoon and the real strengthened slightly against the dollar.<br />The right-wing president’s intervention at Petrobras was widely seen among investors as a pivotal moment in his two-year-old administration, a sign that he was going to put politics above economics ahead of his 2022 re-election bid. Subsidizing fuel prices would likely cost the state firm billions of dollars a year, crippling its finances and diminishing its ability to find and produce more oil.</td>

      <td>Officials are still counting fatalities from hypothermia, carbon monoxide, other factors as some experts warn accurate total might never be known</td>
      <td>The harsh winter storm that hit Texas and other states last week has been blamed for dozens of deaths, though officials said that it would be weeks or months before the human cost of the freezing weather and utility crisis is known and that it might never be fully accurate.<br />The failure of the state’s electrical grid during the weeklong cold snap left more than four million Texans without electricity and heat, many for days on end in subfreezing temperatures. Many residents also lost access to water, and 14.6 million were ordered to boil water to make it safe to drink. Power had been restored in most of the state by Tuesday morning, but 7.5 million people in 204 counties remained under boil-water orders.<br />So far, nearly 80 people have died a result of the storm and its effects, according to the Associated Press.<br />An 11-year-old boy was found frozen in his bed, his family told the Houston Chronicle. A grandmother and three grandchildren died in a house fire as they were trying to stay warm, the Chronicle also reported. At least six deaths occurred near the Abilene area, local media reported, including a patient who couldn’t get medical treatment due to a lack of water and three elderly men who were found dead in subfreezing homes.<br />Harris County, which includes Houston, has confirmed at least 15 hypothermia deaths and one fatal fall on ice, according to its forensics institute. Several others died from carbon-monoxide poisoning after taking unsafe measures to stay warm, according to the county’s top executive. In Travis County, which includes Austin, the medical examiner’s office is busy processing more than 80 cases from last week to determine causes of death, an official said.</td>

His remarks suggested, however, that improvement won’t prod the Fed to tighten monetary policy anytime soon.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia may be the most vocal Democrat sharing his concerns about the minimum-wage increase included in his party’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill—but he isn’t the only one with misgivings.<br />As the House prepares to pass the relief bill later this week and send it to the Senate, Democratic leaders will have to contend with the quieter but broader pack of Senate Democrats who have problems with the legislation. And in order for Democrats to pass the bill without GOP support, they can’t afford to lose a single vote within their own ranks.<br />Mr. Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are the only two Democrats to say outright they oppose increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, up from $7.25 currently. But 10 other Senate Democrats haven’t signed onto stand-alone legislation increasing the minimum wage to that level, and some have voiced objections to the current structure of the pay boost, setting the stage for possible revisions.<br />“Everyone is going to have things that they want to see in the bill, and we’ll work hard to see if we can get those things in the bill, but job number one is to pass the bill,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told reporters Tuesday.<br />The legislation, which is backed by President Biden and expected to pass the House later this week, would provide $400-a-week unemployment benefits through Aug. 29, send $1,400 per-person payments to most households, provide billions in funding for schools and vaccine distribution, expand the child tax credit, broaden child-care assistance and bolster tax credits for health insurance.</td>

      <td>Your editorial “Texas Spins Into the Wind” (Feb. 18) misplaces the blame for the rolling blackouts in Texas on its “frozen turbines.” Here in Michigan, we have more than a thousand wind turbines that operate without failure in far more severe winter weather than Texas has ever seen. The difference is that our wind turbines are equipped with optional cold-weather packages; apparently the turbines in Texas are not. This is an extra-cost option that wind-turbine manufacturers offer, just as auto makers offer optional cold-weather packages for the cars they sell. Michigan gas pipelines and power plants are also winterized, and continue to operate in severe weather. It isn’t the fault of wind-turbine technology that some of the wind turbines in Texas froze; it was the result of a cost-cutting purchase decision that backfired.<br />This isn’t the first time. Ten years ago, in February 2011, Texas had unusually cold weather that led to power plant failures (both wind and gas) causing 3.2 million customers to lose power. Then, as now, more power was lost from frozen gas facilities than frozen wind turbines; only 6% of their electricity came from wind at that time. There was an investigation, of course. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reported a key finding: “The lack of any state, regional or reliability standards that directly require generators to perform winterization left winter-readiness dependent on plant or corporate choices.” Texas power producers could have equipped their wind turbines and gas systems for this weather.

Meanwhile, the Senate confirmed Linda Thomas-Greenfield as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Tom Vilsackas agriculture secretary. Merrick Garland, Mr. Biden’s nominee for attorney general, is also expected to be confirmed with bipartisan support next month.<br />California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Mr. Biden’s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, faced questions Tuesday from Republicans who said he is too liberal and lacks public-health experience. “I’ll say what I’ve said to him privately. I’m not sold yet,” said Sen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.), the ranking Republican on the committee.<br />Several Republicans on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee suggested they weren’t satisfied with responses from Rep.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) is undecided on both Mr. Becerra and Ms. Haaland, his office said, and he threw Ms. Tanden’s nomination to lead OMB into doubt late last week when he said he would oppose confirming her.</td>

Unfortunately the Obama path rarely achieved the stated results. What comes to mind is the contradiction between President Biden’s pronounced priorities and the real-world impact of his early achievements, such as they are.<br />Shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline works against his overarching desire to move toward full employment. In addition, the alternatives to movement of oil by pipeline will exacerbate our carbon footprint and global-warming concerns. The minimum wage of $15 per hour guarantees a net reduction in entry-level jobs across the country and has dire consequences for very small businesses. Strong statements on foreign-affairs matters that have nothing behind them diminish U.S. influence, don’t inspire “global admiration for U.S. values” and are a disservice to our allies abroad. Close affiliation with Black Lives Matter doesn’t send a positive message to the overall U.S. population. The actual implications of President Biden’s policies as currently advanced don’t enhance peace and prosperity.

      <td>In Netflix’s six-part documentary, historian interviews and bloody re-enactments tell the story of the country’s civil war.</td>
      <td>The ostensible subjects of “Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan” are dubbed “the mounted knights of old Japan” and while a properly romantic description, it falls a bit short: The sword-wielding martial artists of the feudal era (1185-1868) have not only taken up residence in the Western imagination but created ornate, interlacing connections between pop cultures East and West. Akira Kurosawa, for instance, who was a student of John Ford, portrayed his heroes like the gunslingers of the Old West, or even Prohibition gangsters. Detective novelist Dashiell Hammett’s 1929 “Red Harvest” was the basis for Kurosawa’s “Yojimbo,” which in turn inspired Sergio Leone’s “A Fistful of Dollars,” which inspired the Bruce Willis movie “Last Man Standing.” Beneath all the intersecting fictional mayhem lay feudal roots. Most of us samurai-movie fans just don’t know where or what they are.<br />The experts in “Age of Samurai” certainly do. And they tell far more than the average viewer is going to be able to consume over the six parts of the documentary series, which is devoted to the history, traditions and politics not just of the samurai but of Japan itself. It is as much about the “Age” as of the “Samurai” and follows a familiar path familiar to Netflix documentary viewers: Historians and other academics and authors comment on the story being retold, while dramatic re-creations follow it—often, in this case, to harrowing effect. According to one of the interviewees, samurai, a word that originally meant “servant,” were “probably the greatest warriors the world has ever known.” This is precisely the kind of unprovable hype that might turn a viewer off, though the dramatic portions of the program strive to make it seem so: The descriptions, accounts and dramatic re-enactments of the “melee combat” conducted with the legendary katana (samurai swords) result in geysers of blood, rolling heads and certainly are meant to impress viewers with not just the degree but the intimacy of the violence that occurred between rival clans, which used the samurai as their infantry.<br />It’s a fascinating narrative retold and begins here in 1551 with the death of Oda Nobuhide, head of the powerful Oda clan at a time when the central government of Japan had collapsed and incited civil wars across the country among the various power- and land-hungry daimyo, or warlords. The principal character, beginning with episode 1, is Oda Nobunaga, the unpredictable, bloodthirsty and ultimately brilliant son of Nobuhide who would become the first “great unifier” of Japan, but not before modernizing military strategies and introducing firearms into what was previously an arena of hand-to-hand combat.<br />“Age of Samurai” has an international cast of academicians, some quite captivating, on hand to deliver a historically substantiated account of the samurai and their emerging nation. They include the historian-authors Stephen Turnbull, David Spafford, Tomoko Kitagawa and others, all of whom seem to agree on almost everything that happened, which seems odd: Aren’t historians supposed to disagree? One might expect more clashing of academic katanas, but they are as unified as Japan would be, more or less, when the feudal bloodletting was over.</td>

      <td>Men whose style skews casual are zeroing in on the coziest things around: outrageously soft fleece trousers</td>
      <td>IF YOU BELIEVE that shlumpy, elastic-waisted sweatpants sit at the extreme end of casual wear, well, you are wrong. Push further into the realm of comfort and you will find fuzzy fleece pants, perhaps the most notable achievement in wearable coziness. Cut like a roomy sweatpant (often with a similarly accommodating elastic waist) but fabricated in a highly insulating plush material, fleece pants are like a Patagonia Retro-X jacket transplanted onto your legs. Could it get any cozier than that?<br />Fleece pants are not a recent creation. Back in the 1990s, Gene Han, the owner of Hatchet Outdoor Supply Co., a clothing shop with locations in Brooklyn and Los Angeles, recalls seeing fleece pants from labels like ACG— Nike ’s  techy, hiking-inspired sub-label. This winter, though, he’s witnessed an unprecedented demand for his shop’s stock of the teddy-bear-plush pants from nature-focused labels Gramicci and Manastash. “We are totally sold out….I wanted some for myself while I’m stuck at home and I couldn’t even pick them up,” he said.<br />It’s not just that they’re stupendously soft. Mr. Han (whose shop also sells sweatpants) considers fleece pants toastier and therefore “superior” to sweats. Converts concur. Fleece pants are “like wearing a blanket for each of your legs,” said Kyle Bevilacqua, 36, a New Jersey-based corporate tax attorney who bought a pair of furry fleece trousers from New York’s 18 East about a year ago. Mr. Bevilacqua, who is a runner, initially got the pants because he wanted “something super warm to wear” to winter races.<br />As a source of insulation, the fleece pants exceeded his expectations and have since infiltrated his daily winter wardrobe. He wears them with waffle-knit sweaters and, for maximum coziness, a fleece sweatshirt. On super cold days, Mr. Bevilacqua said, “they became this really great thing to throw on to run out and grab a coffee or just take a walk around town.” The highly textural trousers also provoke envying comments: “I’ve gotten a few ‘those look so incredibly warm.’”<br />Kendall Riley, 29, a software consultant in Lawrence, Kan., snags compliments, too, when he wears one of his three pairs of Gramicci fleece pants, which are cut a bit like a straight-legged five-pocket jean. “I had someone say that ‘they’re really fun,’” he said. Recently, he posted a photo of himself in the fluffy bottoms on Instagram and a friend’s mother messaged him to ask where she could get them for her son. Mr. Riley tends to pair the fluffy pants with simple fare like a navy sweatshirt or a matching tan Patagonia fleece.</td>

Andrew Cuomo did something wrong in his handling of Covid-19 in the state’s nursing homes, according to a poll released Tuesday.<br />The poll by Marist College Institute for Public Opinion found the Democratic governor’s job-approval rating had slipped below 50%. Of the 953 adults surveyed Feb. 15 to 17, 49% said they approved and 44% said they disapproved of the job he is doing. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.<br />“Cuomo’s approval rating, which was sky high in the summer, has returned to its pre-pandemic level,” Marist Poll Director Lee M. Miringoff said. “Should Cuomo decide to seek a fourth term, these results suggest it will be a challenge. That said, his current numbers are comparable to what they were when he faced the voters last time.”<br />It is the third poll released amid weeks of rising criticism of the way Mr. Cuomo’s administration delayed a fuller accounting of the number of New Yorkers who died at long-term-care facilities. Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Mr. Cuomo, said the results varied between polls, and two other surveys showed the governor’s job approval above 50%.<br />“We remain focused on fighting this pandemic, administering as many vaccines as possible, and safely and smartly reopening our state,” Mr. Azzopardi said.</td>

      <td>Cruise line shares are trading up on reopening hopes alone</td>
      <td>If you are confused by the savage recovery of so-called “reopening” stocks, you are clearly overthinking things. Yes, sectors like hotels, amusement parks and casinos are soaring, even as revenues remain severely depressed. But markets’ new mantra seems to channel the age-old design principle: “Keep it simple, stupid.”<br />Look no further than cruise stocks. Shares of the three major cruise lines are up an average of 53% over the past six months, even though there has been little in the way of an actual restart in the industry. As  Royal Caribbean  Group’s chief executive officer, Richard Fain, said on his company’s fourth-quarter conference call Monday, most of its ships are still sitting idle after almost a year, and most of its global operations have been suspended at least through April. Meanwhile, Carnival Corp. apparently has decided that if it can’t sell cruise tickets, it will just sell stock instead. The company said on Monday it was raising $1 billion in common stock, also indicative of strong investor demand for the sidelined industry.<br />Hope floats, apparently. Estimates compiled by Visible Alpha show analysts expect Royal Caribbean’s revenue to remain down from 2019 levels by 74% this year and not exceed pre-pandemic levels until 2023. UBS analyst Robin Farley argues that while bookings look to be down for the second half of this year on an absolute basis compared with a normal year, booking volume is likely to be well above service capacity, given cruise lines’ plan for a phased re-entry of select ships at a time. She also noted cumulative advance bookings for the first half of next year are within historical ranges and seem to be at higher prices, a sign of pent-up consumer demand.<br />An analysis of booking trends done by cruise review site Cruise Critic is also encouraging. The site said it saw a 40% increase in cruise shoppers in January versus December, with the majority of bookings for trips this year rather than next year. But future cruising may be contingent upon certain protocol being put in place: 81% of Cruise Critic readers polled in January and February said they would cruise if there was a vaccination requirement to sail. While it is still unclear at this point what the regulations will be for future passengers to cruise, Royal Caribbean’s Mr. Fain did refer to vaccines as “the ultimate weapon” on Monday.<br />Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Woronka argued in a note this week that historically it has “proven unwise to fight a thesis trade”—in this case pent-up demand for vacations—no matter what consensus expectations may be. The risk, he notes ironically, is that analysts’ forecasts will catch up to or even exceed those of investors. This would set the stocks up for disappointment if actual earnings fall short of estimates once cruising resumes.</td>

      <td>The coronavirus pandemic has caused another kind of pervasive affliction, Harvard researchers say: loneliness.<br />More than one-third of 950 Americans reported feeling lonely at least “frequently” in the previous four weeks, according to a newly released survey by researchers at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, conducted in October. That’s higher than the quarter of respondents who recalled feeling serious loneliness in the two months before the pandemic, and 28% of respondents said they had experienced increases in the frequency of their loneliness. Young adults and mothers felt especially isolated, the survey reported.<br />Social disruption has hit people in myriad ways: A college student living back at home may feel disconnected from their normal social life, while an overworked parent may feel detached from their usual support system. And even people managing to cultivate an active Zoom-led social life may still feel disconnected.<br />But it is possible to take steps to reduce loneliness, says Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer in Harvard’s Graduate School of Education who directs the Making Caring Common project, which has studied community and interfamily relationships over the course of the pandemic.<br />Dr. Weissbourd spoke with the Journal about the rise in loneliness and what we can do about it.</td>

As a result, incorrect valuations were likely reported to investors.<br />Infinity Q had about $3 billion in assets under management at the end of January, with roughly $1.8 billion belonging to its Infinity Q Diversified Alpha Fund, according to an SEC filing. The fund employed so-called alternative strategies, including volatility and betting on and against stocks, according to disclosures.<br />Halting redemptions is an unusual move, since mutual funds offer freedom to cash out at any time, and it suggests severe problems at the firm. Third Avenue Management LLC halted redemptions in one of its credit funds in 2015, a move that shocked the market, left a black mark on the firm and spurred worries about the wider bond market.<br />Infinity Q said in a statement that the firm is “cooperating with the SEC investigation” and has cut off Mr. Velissaris’s access to trading.</td>

      <td>Senate Republicans are eager to get aid where it’s needed, reopen schools and encourage work.</td>
      <td>Democrats are anxious for any excuse to blow up the Senate filibuster, the last procedural hurdle to one-party government. Their latest is that Republicans oppose the president’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package. Despite having passed five bipartisan Covid-19 relief bills to date—including one barely seven weeks ago—they claim our opposition demonstrates historic intransigence.<br />No, it demonstrates that the $1.9 trillion bill is a clunker. It would waste hundreds of billions of dollars, do nothing meaningful to get kids back to school, and enact policies that work against job creation. The Congressional Budget Office’s recent analysis of the plan found that more than a third of the proposed funding—$700 billion—wouldn’t be spent until 2022 or later, undermining the administration’s claim that the massive price tag is justified for urgent pandemic-related needs.<br />The Biden stimulus is unsound economic policy. High unemployment isn’t the result of too little money in American pockets; it’s because of the pandemic. Sending out checks won’t get consumers back into restaurants, bars, salons, malls, hotels or airplanes. Near-record levels of savings are evidence that consumers are able to spend. When Covid is finally in the rearview mirror, they will come roaring back. Congress should target assistance to those who need it and help speed the delivery of vaccines—not borrow hundreds of billions more to check items off a political wish list, deepening the nation’s debt and risking inflation.<br />The bill is also filled with bad policies and sloppy math. It calls for $350 billion for states and localities. If you live in New York, you might think that sounds about right because the pandemic severely exacerbated your state’s existing financial woes. But New York is the exception. Florida hasn’t even had to dip into its rainy-day fund. California has a multibillion-dollar surplus. Utah’s revenues rose by double digits.<br />JP Morgan  found that 21 states had revenue increases in 2020. Other states drew on rainy-day funds—which is what they are there for. Only a few are in severe financial distress. The same is true of cities and counties: Some are hurting, but the great majority aren’t. Most local tax revenue comes from property taxes, which are far less volatile than sales or income taxes. Sending out hundreds of billions of dollars to states and localities regardless of need is both wasteful and harmful. It would create incentives for the mismanagement that got some states into fiscal trouble in the first place.</td>

      <td>Beijing is obsessed with viruses, but not biosafety. We are paying a high price for its lapses.</td>
      <td>The Chinese Communist Party is obsessed with viruses. Its army of scientists claim to have discovered almost 2,000 new viruses in a little over a decade. It took the past 200 years for the rest of the world to discover that many. More troubling is the party’s negligence on biosafety. The costs and the risk to world health are enormous, as evidenced by a novel coronavirus that escaped Wuhan. This situation can’t continue. The world must hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable and punish Beijing if it fails to uphold global biosafety standards, including basic transparency requirements.<br />The most recent example of this malfeasance is playing out around us. The evidence that the virus came from Wuhan is enormous, though largely circumstantial, and most signs point to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or WIV, as the source of Covid-19. In America, concern about the site is now broad and bipartisan. The Biden administration stated that it has “deep concerns” about the World Health Organization’s investigation into the early days of the pandemic, particularly Beijing’s interference with the investigators’ work.<br />The world has known for a long time that WIV poses a huge risk to global health. Two 2018 State Department cables warned of its biosafety problems. They even predicted that SARS-CoV-2’s ACE2 receptor, identified by WIV scientists, would enable human-to-human transmission. Yuan Zhiming, then director of WIV’s biosafety level 4 lab, warned, “The biosafety laboratory is a double-edge sword: It can be used for the benefit of humanity, but can also lead to a disaster.” He listed the shortfalls prevalent among China’s biology labs, including a lack of “operational technical support, professional instructions” and “feasible standards for the safety requirements of different protection zones and for the inoculation of microbiological animals and equipment.”<br />The Chinese public took note, with several bloggers alleging that WIV’s virus-carrying animals are sold as pets. They may even show up at local wet markets. After the Wuhan outbreak, one since-disappeared blogger asked a WIV researcher to debate the lab’s biosafety practices in public. The offer was ignored.<br />Beijing has a moral and legal obligation to take biosafety seriously, especially given the kind of research going on at WIV. In 2015, WIV’s Dr. Shi Zhengli co-wrote an article titled “A SARS-like Cluster of Circulating Bat Coronaviruses Shows Potential for Human Emergence” in which she admitted that her team had engineered “chimeric” and “hybrid” viruses from horseshoe bats. In a 2019 article titled “Bat Coronavirus in China,” Ms. Shi and her co-authors warned, “It is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China.” At the time, WIV housed tens of thousands of bat virus samples and experiment animals.</td>

      <td>Macy’s  belongs to an endangered species in the world of retail. That comes with one benefit: Every sign of life can be enough to keep investors on board.<br />Macy’s did have a better holiday season than expected. Net sales were down 18.7% in the quarter ended Jan. 30 compared with a year earlier, better than the 22.6% decline that analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected. But that was still a steeper revenue decline than the 14.4% drop that department stores around the country experienced over the same period, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.<br />The retailer also benefited from fewer product returns compared with previous holiday seasons—thanks in large part to customers buying less clothes. Home, beauty, jewelry and watch categories were popular this holiday season.<br />Net income was a positive surprise, coming in at $160 million compared with the $14.3 million analysts expected. That was mostly thanks to greatly reduced operating expenses. The department store chain reduced operating costs by $900 million for the full year and expects to keep expenses at that depressed level going forward. For the full year, Macy’s incurred a net loss of $3.9 billion.<br />It is important to remember that behind Macy’s cost reductions are expectations that it will sell less going forward. Macy’s thinks fiscal 2021 net sales will be 15.5% lower than fiscal 2019 levels at the high end of its guidance. That’s not a high bar: Sales also declined in 2019.</td>

In two rounds of voting, the ruling party, Georgian Dream, cemented its hold on power. The party’s creator, metals and real-estate tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili—who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s—is largely believed to influence the government from behind the scenes.</td>

Tesla Inc.  had fallen 2% after dropping as much as 12% in early trading, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1% after an early decline of 4% put it on track for its worst day since September. The index is down 6% from its peak Feb. 12, as rising U.S. interest rates prompt a broad re-evaluation of investor growth expectations, and on track for a sixth straight decline—its longest pullback in a year.<br />Tesla, whose 743% surge last year highlighted the tech-led market rebound from the coronavirus selloff, is now down for 2021 and has lost a quarter of its value since the electric-car maker said on Feb. 8 that it had spent $1.5 billion on bitcoin in an effort to boost returns on cash.<br />Other investor favorites were also recovering after being hit hard in early trading.  Moderna Inc.,  the maker of a major Covid-19 vaccine, was down 7% after falling as much as 13%.

      <td>Schools are getting billions they can spend over nearly a decade.</td>
      <td>Perhaps you’ve heard that the $1.9 trillion House spending bill is meant to provide “urgent” and “emergency” relief. But did you know that the Covid emergency in America’s schools will apparently last through 2028?<br />The House proposal showers K-12 schools with nearly $129 billion. That’s on top of the $13.2 billion allocated in last spring’s Cares Act and the $54.3 billion in December’s bipartisan splurge. According to the Congressional Budget Office, schools have spent only a fraction of that previous $67.5 billion. It’s hard to spend money when schools aren’t open for classroom instruction since unions have resisted returning to work in much of the country.<br />Because of this leftover cash, CBO estimates that a mere $6.4 billion of the new aid package will be spent for K-12 schools in the 2021 fiscal year. That’s right—only $6 billion of $129 billion will be spent during the pandemic emergency.<br />CBO estimates that $32.1 billion will be spent in fiscal 2022 on K-12 schools, $32.1 billion in 2023, $25.7 billion in 2024, $19.3 billion in 2025, $9 billion in 2026, $2.6 billion in 2027, and $1.3 billion in 2028.<br />In other words, this isn’t about Covid relief. School districts can spend the funds on a wide range of options—from sanitizing classrooms to “continuing to employ existing staff of the local educational agency”—and the money is fungible. This means that, after the pandemic eases perhaps as soon as this year, school districts are likely to use the money to pad their bureaucracies and teacher payrolls. One of the bill’s few limitations is that local educational agencies must spend 20% of their funds to address “learning loss” with interventions such as summer school or extended-day programs. This would require more money for teacher pay or additional hiring for union dues-paying positions.</td>

That was exponentially higher than the average price, which was $21.18 per megawatt hour in 2020, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, the nonprofit that controls the grid.<br />Now power retailers and municipal utilities are trying to figure out how to pass on the billions of dollars in costs to customers, some of whom face bills in the thousands of dollars that may need to be stretched out over time.<br />In Denton, a North Texas university city that suffered outages and natural-gas supply shortages, city leaders are looking to borrow up to $300 million to cover fuel expenses from last week, which amounts to around $2,000 for each of the city’s 150,000 residents.</td>

Iran has rejected direct negotiations with the U.S., as long as American sanctions remain in place and the U.S. remains outside the 2015 deal. But European officials have warned Iran in recent days that it risks deepening its isolation if it misses the opportunity for direct talks with Biden administration officials, who would attend as guests in the informal meeting.<br />“These diplomatic contacts have to be discreet but I am reasonably optimistic” that Iran will join talks, the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said Monday.<br />Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei said Tuesday that Iran was “looking into the European side’s proposal of an informal meeting for a dialogue.”<br />Meanwhile, citing the U.S. refusal to lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, Iran on Tuesday followed through on a previous threat, saying it would no longer grant United Nations inspectors daily access to its nuclear facilities, or provide round-the-clock security footage of its activities at these sites. Iran will also bar the U.N. atomic agency from inspecting other sites where it suspects nuclear-related work might be taking place.</td>

      <td>Democrats in Congress are racing to meet a mid-March deadline for President Biden’s coronavirus relief package before existing benefits like enhanced unemployment insurance expire. Here’s an overview of the $1.9 trillion legislation, which they are looking to pass with only Democratic votes. The package includes some elements, such as a $15 minimum wage, that might not survive intraparty negotiations or Senate rules.<br />The House and Senate passed a budget resolution earlier this month that allows them to craft a $1.9 trillion relief package. The size of the package has stayed the same since it was unveiled by President-elect Biden during the transition period, and after he rebuffed a proposal by a group of 10 Republicans who argued for a $618 billion bill.<br />The Biden administration says the package is the right size and that the economy needs relief on that scale in order to bring down real unemployment rates that the Federal Reserve estimates to be around 10%—accounting for misclassifications in government data and people who have exited the labor force—and to alleviate the economic hardship faced by millions whose lives and jobs have been disrupted.<br />“We think it’s very important to have a big package that addresses the pain this has caused,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently.<br />But Republicans have pointed to falling infection rates and unspent funds from previous relief packages as a reason to wait on any further stimulus. Meanwhile, many private economists have raised their growth outlooks for the year.</td>

      <td>This year’s furious rally in cryptocurrencies lost steam Tuesday, knocking prices for bitcoin and ether from recent highs, alongside drops in other risky assets including tech stocks.<br />Bitcoin fell 11% to $47,145 after hitting a record of $58,332 Sunday, according to CoinDesk. The decline lowered its market cap—the value of all bitcoin in circulation—to $878 billion, down from more than $1 trillion last week. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by total market value, fell almost 13% to $1,523.<br />A broad turn in markets toward caution, coupled with historically high prices, likely triggered the correction, analysts and investors said.<br />“The types of moves we were seeing in 2021 were parabolic,” said Joel Kruger, a strategist at cryptocurrency exchange LMAX Digital. “When you see moves like that, it’s obvious these markets are going to be due for a pullback.”<br />Assets—crypto or otherwise—that gained the most during the pandemic have slipped in recent days as investors bet on economies opening up. U.S. government bond yields have risen to their highest level in a year. When yields on safe bonds rise, that makes speculative assets, such as cryptocurrencies and shares in companies with profits far in the future, less attractive.</td>

      <td>A much-anticipated strategic update continues the bank’s frustratingly slow pivot toward Asia, only with lower shareholder returns</td>
      <td>Another year, another familiar-sounding strategic update at  HSBC .  The behemoth’s need to reiterate its pivot to Asia underlines what a slow, awkward process it is.<br />The London-headquartered, China-focused bank announced full-year results on Tuesday. As at peers, revenues were hit by lower interest rates globally and chunky allowances for pandemic-related loan losses. Unlike at investment-banking rivals, the bump in trading revenues from HSBC’s own trimmed-back business was a meager offset. A much-anticipated new strategy amounted to more of the same—except for lowered shareholders returns.<br />The shares fell in early trading, extending a year of underperformance. For much of the past decade the stock has traded at a premium to most European peers because of HSBC’s strong business in Hong Kong and mainland China, both profitable, fast-growing markets. But that gap has narrowed considerably in the past year, likely for two main reasons: Investors want faster organizational change, and they are concerned that HSBC’s trademark business model of bridging East and West is getting more difficult.<br />The bank broadly delivered on its 2020 targets. However, return on tangible equity or ROTE fell to just 3.1% from 8.4% a year earlier, and dividends were suspended at the British regulator’s request. The pandemic seems a valid excuse. The real disappointment was in its guidance for future returns. Target ROTE has been reduced and delayed, even with an additional $1 billion in cost cuts. Dividend expectations were pared back too: The growing quarterly payment has been replaced with a 40% to 55% payout ratio, possibly topped up with buybacks or special dividends.<br />Strategically, the bank is still focused on shifting more assets from Europe and the U.S. into Asia, as well as increasing its wealth management business and making its operations more digital. The direction of travel makes sense, but the pace remains frustratingly sedate, particularly as competition in the region is picking up. Discussions continue about long-mooted exits from retail operations in France and the U.S.</td>

Additionally, Tether agreed to publicly release quarterly statements detailing its reserves.<br />The attorney general’s office said the companies made several public misrepresentations, regarding the dollar reserves backing for tether in 2017 and a situation in 2018 when Bitfinex lost access to about $850 million of its customers’ funds that it had placed with an outside company.<br />When Bitfinex lost those customer funds, it borrowed money from the tether reserves to cover the loss, something it didn’t disclose publicly. That money has since been paid back, though Bitfinex is still trying to recover the original $850 million.<br />The settlement ends a long-running saga that had been keenly followed in the crypto industry.

Bonsu experienced difficulty breathing during a bad bout with Covid-19 in late December, she frequently FaceTimed with a longtime friend more than 4,000 miles away.<br />“I couldn’t lay down flat because I couldn’t breathe and I was like, ‘What if I stop breathing?’ ’’ said the 27-year-old, fourth-year medical-school student. “She would usually stay on FaceTime until I fell asleep,” said Ms. Bonsu, who has been living with her parents in Pickerington, Ohio, during the pandemic. Her friend, Che’anna Poole, lives in Hawaii. “She really is like a sister,” Ms. Bonsu said.<br />Ms. Poole belongs to what Ms. Bonsu calls her chosen family, a group of close-knit friends she developed familial-like bonds with. Since pandemic quarantining began last March, chosen families, a term first popularized by members of the gay and lesbian community in the 1970s and 1980s and later by other demographics, have been a lifeline for many people.<br />“Covid made voluntary families even more important than normal,” said Dawn O. Braithwaite, a professor of interpersonal and family communication at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.<br />In Ms. Bonsu’s case, her chosen family swooped in when she and her parents came down with the virus. Other people turn to their chosen families because they live far from their biological or legal families or they’re estranged from them. Some individuals reached out to their chosen families when they wanted a break from being cooped up with their biological or legal families under quarantine.</td>

      <td>BRUSSELS—Some European countries are starting to block Chinese involvement in their economies, drawing closer to positions advocated by the U.S. amid growing anxiety in Europe over China’s increasingly aggressive geopolitical posture.<br />Governments from the Baltic to the Adriatic seas have recently canceled public tenders that Chinese state-owned companies were set to win, or are moving to ban Chinese companies from investing or contracting in their countries.<br />The shifts have been prompted by a mix of national-security concerns and disappointment with the performance of Chinese contractors, say officials involved in the decisions. Several of the canceled projects fell within China’s world-wide infrastructure initiative, Belt and Road, which has disappointed several participating countries.<br />The shift is largely taking place in smaller European countries, adding to tensions within the European Union, where big countries still largely favor maintaining business links with China.<br />Romania and Lithuania are taking broad measures to exclude Chinese companies from certain public procurements. Other moves are more targeted. Authorities in Slovenia, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Romania have suspended public tenders involving Chinese companies for work on nuclear-power plants, highways, rail lines, security scanners and a shipping-container terminal. Greece is debating whether to allow a Chinese shipping company to increase its majority stake in the country’s largest port.</td>

Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Startups often offer stock as part of an employee’s pay. Wilson Sonsini created its own stock-plan software decades ago to help clients track the value of their employees’ holdings as companies matured from early-stage startups and raised outside money to finance their growth.<br />Morgan Stanley is pushing into stock-plan administration as an early entree into the financial lives of a new generation of customers. Some of those clients, the bank hopes, will turn to it for more lucrative services, such as advice, as their needs grow more complex. The digitization of finance has unleashed low- or no-cost services, such as commission-free trades and zero-fee investment funds, that money managers are deploying to attract new clients.<br />The Wilson Sonsini agreement aims to give Morgan Stanley a leg up in cementing connections with startups and their employees before a possible public offering. Some will become millionaires overnight; Google Inc., LinkedIn,  Twitter Inc.  and  Lyft Inc.  are among the companies the law firm helped take public.<br />Morgan Stanley paid $900 million to acquire Solium Capital Inc. in 2019, adding a platform that specialized in privately held firms and last year bought E*Trade Financial Corp., which manages stock plans for hundreds of companies, for $13 billion.</td>

Sudhakar Ramakrishna, president and chief executive of SolarWinds, is scheduled to testify about his company’s handling of the breach, along with other technology executives whose companies and products were ensnared in the attack or have helped respond to it.<br />That hack is one of the most significant yet to be probed by Congress. Previous headline breaches in recent years, such as those at the Office of Personnel Management,  Equifax Inc.  and a spate of retail hacks at stores like  Target Corp. , prompted hearings but generally haven’t spurred Congress to pass substantive cybersecurity legislation.<br />Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the new Democratic chairman of the committee, has said he would make scrutiny of the SolarWinds episode a priority of his panel. He said he hoped the severity of the attack would reinvigorate debate on legislative and policy proposals, including a reconsideration of a national data breach notification law.<br />“We get these blips of interest in cyber and then it fades,” Mr. Warner said in an interview earlier this month. The SolarWinds hack raised broader questions about the security of software supply chains on which the government relies, Mr. Warner said. “We are still trying to learn how big, how broad, how much it is going to cost to remediate,” he said.</td>

The agreement marks the culmination of months of private talks between finance officials and creditors to assess the long-term damage to Puerto Rico’s economy stemming from Covid-19.<br />Investment firms that participate would exchange their claims for a mix of cash, restructured bonds and tradable securities known as contingent value instruments that only pay out if sales-tax collections exceed certain projections.<br />A sustained rally in high-yield municipal bonds, including Puerto Rico’s, helped to ease the deal, according to bondholders and advisers involved in negotiations. Yield-hungry investors have been drawn to risky municipal bonds in part due to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s commitment to ultralow rates.</td>

Prices continued to rise in January, jumping 35% compared with a year earlier, according to data collected by real-estate brokerage Redfin. New Jersey gambling revenue, meanwhile, tumbled 17% in 2020.<br />Atlantic City home-price gains followed efforts by local officials and real-estate investors to transform the town from a place where gamblers would try their luck at table games to a place where more people wanted to live and work permanently.<br />“They want to build up the Atlantic City economy where it’s based off of businesses and activities that are not casino related,” said Joshua Garay, a New York real-estate broker. Locals have pushed to create more jobs in the cybersecurity industry and to add more family friendly offerings, including a recently announced plan for an indoor water park on the boardwalk.<br />Mr. Garay is working with the owners of the former Atlantic Club Casino Hotel, which closed in 2014, to renovate its hotel and potentially to develop new condominiums.

Mr. Gensler, a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., gained a reputation as an aggressive enforcer while running the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 2009 through 2013.<br />Mr. Gensler, who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management after leaving government, has made few public statements of his views on private equity, however, and it is unclear whether he sees reforming buyout-fund practices as a priority.<br />Regulatory experts see a likelihood that if Mr. Gensler is confirmed by the Senate, the SEC could return to large, headline-making fines against private equity, which became less common under Jay Clayton, who led the agency from 2017 through 2020. Mr. Clayton last week said he would join the board of buyout firm  Apollo Global Management Inc.  as a lead independent director.<br />Mr. Gensler “got a lot done because he made a big splash” leading the CFTC, said Joe Weinstein, head of the securities and shareholder litigation practice at law firm and lobbying group Squire Patton Boggs. “I do think he’s going to try to send a message to whatever subset of the industry he is focusing on.”</td>

      <td>Coming fourth-quarter results may mark the peak of investor appetite</td>
      <td>DoorDash  is a newly minted $65 billion public food-delivery company trading near its highs just as the coronavirus is beginning to wane and restaurants are opening back up. What could possibly go wrong?<br />The nearest catalyst could be deceiving. The company is set to dish out fourth-quarter results on Thursday, its first report as a public company. All signs point to a capstone end to a phenomenal year for the platform, which now commands a seemingly untouchable 53% of the market, according to data released Friday by Edison Trends.<br />The fourth quarter is seasonally strong for food-delivery players, given cold weather and holidays, but Covid-19 has made 2020 a particular boon. Earlier this month,  Grubhub  said it grew sales 48% year over year in the fourth quarter, while  Uber Technologies  said its Uber Eats business grew revenue 224% in the same period. It makes sense, then, based on competitors’ performance, that investors would be bidding up DoorDash’s stock ahead of its earnings.<br />Uber has yet to turn a profit, but its shares are up 70% over the past year on its food-delivery growth, even as its ride-share bookings were down 43% as of January. Similarly, DoorDash said it lost money in the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, though its revenue more than tripled. As revenue growth inevitably moderates with comparisons becoming increasingly difficult as 2021 goes on, investors’ patience will be tested. Estimates compiled by Visible Alpha forecast another two years of losses ahead for the company.<br />DoorDash’s “first-to-market” growth strategy in the U.S. suburbs and in ancillary categories like convenience delivery have certainly served it well. But competitors are moving onto this turf. Grubhub, for example, said its own restaurant inventory increased 75% in 2020 in suburban and rural areas. And earlier this month, Uber said it was paying more than $1 billion to acquire alcohol-and-convenience delivery platform Drizly. While these moves are validating to DoorDash’s model, they also imply growth may be more costly.</td>

Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast revenue of $30.63 billion in the quarter.<br />Over the full fiscal year, the company’s sales rose by 20% to $132.11 billion. That growth follows a broader trend of people spending more on home-related goods during the pandemic, as lockdowns and telecommuting focused attention on the home. The public-health crisis has also shifted consumer behavior in retailers’ favor by weighing on services spending, such as on travel, leisure and restaurants.<br />In the latest quarter, the number of Home Depot customer transactions rose 12.8% to 416.8 million, and the average transaction size grew to $75.69, from $68.29 in 2019’s fourth quarter. The company finished the quarter with 2,296 retail stores.<br />Home Depot Tuesday posted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.86 billion, or $2.65 a share, compared with $2.48 billion, or $2.28 a share, a year earlier.

      <td>The latest market gyrations are being driven by “real” rates rather than simply by inflation expectations. Investors may need to reassess their portfolios.</td>
      <td>Bonds are selling off again, but for different reasons. Investors also need to behave differently.<br />In the U.S., yields on 10-year Treasurys have risen close to 1.4%. Optimism about vaccination campaigns, as well as positive economic and corporate data, have led derivatives markets to price in a chance that the Federal Reserve will—very slowly—start raising interest rates as early as 2023. Yields started moving up consistently in October, which started with them under 0.7%.<br />Despite all the talk in financial markets about higher growth begetting inflation, however, this month’s gyrations have little to do with expectations of rising consumer prices. Rather, it is inflation-adjusted yields—as measured by inflation-linked Treasurys, or TIPS—that are edging higher.<br />This is the opposite of what was happening before February. Earlier bond selloffs were driven by expectations that the Fed would allow inflation to be higher in the future. Even if the central bank acted to tighten monetary policy at some point, the belief that it would do so by less than inflation meant that financial conditions would actually get looser in “real” terms. This made stocks appear more attractive, particularly in high-growth sectors like technology.<br />The flip side is that equity markets are looking less appetizing now. The S&P 500 fell 0.8% Monday, and is down 1.5% since Feb. 12. Tellingly, technology stocks have fallen more than 4% over the same period. Shares of financial companies, which would likely benefit from higher interest rates, have gained about 4%.</td>

      <td>As  Twitter Inc.  looks overseas for growth, India stands out as its fastest-growing major market, one filled with opportunity—and increasingly thorny political challenges.<br />The San Francisco company in recent weeks blocked, unblocked and then blocked again hundreds of accounts in the South Asian nation for posting material New Delhi called inflammatory amid long-running protests by farmers. Twitter’s moves came after the government threatened the company with legal action, which could have resulted in a fine or imprisonment for Twitter executives, if it didn’t remove the handles.<br />Twitter finds itself in an awkward position, analysts say, as it publicly stands by its commitment to allow individuals to express opinions while also abiding by New Delhi’s increasing assertiveness over social media. Twitter’s balancing act highlights a growing conundrum for social-media companies as they run up against governments in key markets where they seek growth as developed countries become saturated.<br />“The problem they face is striking the right balance between ideology and being pragmatic,” said Ashutosh Sharma, a New Delhi-based vice president at research firm Forrester. “Should they be taking sides? They have to be consistent.”<br />Twitter said in a statement earlier this month that it remains “committed to safeguarding the health of the conversation occurring on Twitter, and strongly believe that the Tweets should flow.”</td>

      <td>Music-streaming giant’s new ventures in podcasting, advertising and artist promotion have a high bar, as valuation has surged</td>
      <td>Spotify  sees itself as much more than a music-streaming platform. Investors have long since gotten there.<br />The company laid out an ambitious vision Monday during a two-hour webcast, touting new and coming offerings for listeners, musicians, podcasters and advertisers. These include a new high-fidelity music-streaming service for subscribers, more tools for musicians and podcasters to expand their revenue streams and significant international expansion that will take the service into 85 new markets this year. For podcasting—which has been of particular interest to investors—Spotify has added a new eight-episode series with former President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen.<br />A news dump, in other words. And one that pleased investors initially, sending Spotify’s stock price up 5% before a broad-based tech selloff pushed the shares back down into the red by the end of trading Monday. Spotify is still up more than 11% since the start of the year and about 138% over the past 12 months, well outperforming other hot streaming names such as  Netflix  and  Disney .  Shares of  Warner Music Group ,  which as one of the world’s largest record labels controls some of the most sought-after music Spotify’s subscribers listen to, have actually lost about 4% so far this year.<br />Opportunities beyond music streaming are a key draw for Spotify’s investors right now. The stock’s big surge over the past year has mostly come from hype over new podcast deals, with the likes of Joe Rogan, Kim Kardashian and DC Comics. Even the royal family is getting in on the action; Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made a brief appearance in Monday’s event to tout their own exclusive Spotify podcast, coming later this year.<br />But while the number of podcasts on Spotify tripled last year to 2.2 million, the company has yet to break out any financial details of the venture. The highly popular “Joe Rogan Experience” became exclusive to Spotify on Dec. 1, but the company would only say on its fourth-quarter call on Feb. 4 that the program “contributed positively to user growth on the platform.” In a note following the results, Brian Russo of  Credit Suisse  said the company’s outlook for the current year “does little to suggest this content is driving an inflection in the business.”</td>

      <td>Treasury prices rally, but traders worry about a reversal if inflation picks up</td>
      <td>The spread between the two-year Treasury yield and a key interest rate set by the Federal Reserve is the narrowest since the depths of the coronavirus market selloff, a potential sign of financial-system stress.<br />The two-year Treasury yield, which closed Monday at 0.113%, is 0.013 percentage point above the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER. It traded as low as 0.105% earlier in February. The Fed pays banks on the reserves held above and beyond those required by central-bank regulatory policy as part of its effort to maintain liquidity in the financial system.<br />When the coronavirus sent markets and the economy into a tailspin in March, the Fed cut IOER by 1 percentage point to 0.10%—alongside other interventions—to shore up short-term lending markets and support economic activity. The spread between IOER and the two-year yield has typically been above 0.05 percentage point since the Fed cut the rate to its lowest level ever in March.<br />Traders said the shrinking of this spread reflects appetite for short-term debt as investors gobble up safe assets and park their cash. It also highlights a key tension point in financial markets: to what extent is Fed support for markets taking asset prices to unsustainable levels, and how vulnerable does that leave bond markets and other areas exposed to sudden reversals.<br />Analysts have been watching Treasury auction results to gauge whether increased fiscal spending and a supply surge of Treasury bonds would push short-term Treasury prices down and yields up. So far, that hasn’t happened. But bond traders are concerned that inflation could rise in coming months and years as the government prints money to support the economy and cover future borrowing costs.</td>

Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a tiebreaking vote.<br />“We must ensure people have access to quality, affordable healthcare,” Mr. Becerra said in prepared remarks released ahead of Tuesday’s hearing. “If confirmed, I will work with you to strengthen our Medicare and Medicaid lifelines, reduce the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and ensure we are accountable, spending resources wisely and effectively.”</td>

      <td>Potentially misleading disclosures related to the pandemic attract closer scrutiny from regulators</td>
      <td>After its business was hit by the pandemic, retailer  Ulta Beauty Inc.  appears to have used some accounting cosmetics to add a gloss to its financial results.<br />Operating income at the once-fast-growing chain, which temporarily closed stores during the health crisis, plummeted to $13 million for the nine months through October, a fraction of the $613 million earned in the same period in 2019. Two coronavirus-related items affected the math: a $40 million impairment charge for the value of some stores that reduced the operating income, and $51 million of federal tax credits that increased it.<br />Ulta also reported a much healthier $98 million “adjusted operating income.” This tally, designed to strip out one-time items, added back the $40 million impairment cost, which boosted the adjusted number, but didn’t take off the $51 million of federal aid. If that aid had been removed, the adjusted-operating-income number would have been half of what the company reported.<br />About a year into the pandemic, regulators are ramping up their scrutiny of potentially misleading coronavirus disclosures by companies. A senior Securities and Exchange Commission official warned in December that companies should be consistent in positive and negative adjustments when showing the impact of the pandemic.<br />An Ulta Beauty spokeswoman denied cherry-picking data to flatter the adjusted metric. She said the impairment cost was a legitimate one-time charge caused by the impact of Covid-19 on some stores, not a direct cost of the pandemic such as cleaning supplies.</td>

      <td>The lodging industry is under such stress that some property sellers are willing to lend to prospective hotel buyers the way auto dealers finance vehicle sales: Offer cheap rates and sometimes with little money down.<br />Banks and owners want to get rid of unprofitable hotels that offer little near-term prospect for recovery. But unloading them at bargain prices would lead to losses on their balance sheets. So some are turning to what is known as seller financing.<br />With the typical hotel purchase, a property buyer pays the seller the full purchase price upfront and finances the deal in part with mortgages. But these loans have been harder to come by with the lodging business struggling.<br />Seller financing is the real-estate equivalent of buying a car with dealership financing. A hotel buyer pays only part of the price upfront, usually between 25% and 50%. The rest is treated as a loan from the seller to the buyer, and interest rates are often far lower than for traditional mortgages.<br />For sellers, the practice avoids painful write-downs in the present, but it also risks merely delaying a reckoning. By lending to the new owner, they remain tied to the hotel and at risk of losses if the still-soft lodging market doesn’t recover soon enough.</td>

He was 90.<br />Mr. Yamani, who suffered from poor health for years, died in London, Saudi state TV announced Tuesday. He is expected to be buried in his hometown of Mecca, his former colleagues said. His son Hani Yamani said he had died on Monday.<br />He served in the post for nearly 25 years, starting in 1962. At that time, the U.S.—not Saudi Arabia—dominated the global oil trade as the world’s biggest producer and consumer of the commodity. The Texas Railroad Commission regulated domestic oil prices, while American and British companies held sway over a chunk of overseas production.<br />When Mr. Yamani took over the oil ministry, Saudi Arabia was a middling producer in the oil-rich Mideast. But Saudi Arabia’s deposits, it turns out, were much bigger than its neighbors’, and soon the country’s output was soaring. Amid a wave of oil field nationalizations across the region, Mr. Yamani led talks to take control of the Saudi Arabia Oil Co., then a joint venture between the predecessors to  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Chevron Corp.</td>

Contracts for the Nasdaq-100 retreated 0.6%, suggesting technology stocks will continue to lead the market lower.<br />A sharp rise in yields on U.S. government bonds in recent days has sapped investors’ appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. Shares in technology companies, which have powered the broader market higher for much of the past year, are seen as particularly vulnerable. That is because many tech companies’ valuations are tied to their future earnings potential. Those profits are less valuable in today’s terms when investors apply a higher discount rate.<br />The rise in bond yields “naturally does cause investors and cause markets to re-examine the view on equities,” said Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco. Investing in government bonds is beginning to look more attractive for the first time in months, he said.<br />But “the level at which bond yields become truly problematic for equities is a long way from where we are now,” Mr. Jackson added.</td>

The legislation is being widely watched globally and could offer a model for other countries to compel tech giants to pay for content.<br />Facebook got some changes to the legislation as part of the deal.

In return, Facebook planned to restore news pages to its platform in Australia in the coming days, the statement said.<br />In a news conference, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told him that the company intends to strike commercial deals with Australian media organizations to pay for content.

That loose blade apparently then sheared off part of a second blade that was also fractured, said Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, in a news conference Monday evening.<br />Mr. Sumwalt said investigators are probing why an outer covering known as a cowling detached, as well as why the damaged engine remained on fire even after fuel had been shut off by the flight crew.<br />Last weekend’s incident was third in a string of failures involving the same engine and aircraft types in recent years. American regulators had previously ordered stepped-up inspections of fan blades after an earlier engine failure on another United flight on a Boeing 777 in 2018. Then in December, an engine failed during a  Japan Airlines Co.  flight to Tokyo, prompting the FAA’s fresh scrutiny.<br />The FAA said Monday it had been “evaluating whether to adjust blade inspections” following December’s incident, after reviewing maintenance and inspection records and conducting a metallurgical examination of a fan blade fragment to determine the cause of a fracture in the engine failure.</td>

For five years, as her husband was on the run and in prison, Ms. Coronel acted as Mr. Guzmán’s courier, sending instructions to associates that dealt with increasing heroin production, paying bribes, buying weapons, and trying to bust Mr. Guzmán out of prison, according to an arrest affidavit.<br />Ms. Coronel, believed to be Mr. Guzmán’s third or fourth wife, is charged with conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana in the U.S., according to the affidavit, signed by a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent. She couldn’t be reached for comment. Court records don’t list an attorney for Ms. Coronel.<br />The arrest of Ms. Coronel could add new friction to U.S.-Mexico relations. It comes months after the October arrest in Los Angeles of Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, Mexico’s former defense minister, as he and his family arrived on a family vacation. A month later, U.S. officials dropped charges after Mexico complained that it had been kept in the dark about the U.S. investigation and threatened to cut off antidrug cooperation.<br />The former general was then returned to Mexico where he was eventually cleared of charges after Mexican prosecutors said the U.S. case was weak.

      <td>Fledgling electric vehicle company Lucid Motors Inc. has agreed to go public by merging with special-purpose acquisition company  Churchill Capital Corp IV  in one of the largest ever deals involving a SPAC, the companies said Monday.<br />The deal would inject $4.4 billion into the Bay Area-based auto maker and value Lucid at $24 billion, an enormous amount for a company that has yet to begin production of its first car.<br />Lucid Chief Executive Peter Rawlinson said the company is going public “to accelerate into the next phase of our growth.” The company plans to begin deliveries of its first car, a $169,000 super-luxury all-electric sedan called the Air, in the second half of this year, the company said Monday.<br />Stock investors in Churchill have even higher hopes. Its stock, trading around $40 in after hours trading Monday, implied a valuation for Lucid of more than $65 billion. That compares with the roughly $75 billion market capitalization of General Motors Co., which posted a pretax profit of $9.7 billion last year while selling approximately 6.8 million vehicles world-wide.<br />The deal shows the extraordinary appetite among stock investors for SPACs, particularly anything relating to electric vehicles. Amid the soaring value of  Tesla Inc.’s  shares in the past year, investors have rushed into startups in the sector, injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into new companies like  Fisker Inc.  and  Lordstown Motors Corp. —startups that announced deals to go public when they had employee counts in the dozens and had yet to create any revenue.</td>

      <td>U.S. deaths from the virus surpassed half a million nearly a year after a world-wide pandemic was declared</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—With a moment of silence and a candlelit memorial, President Biden marked the loss of life from Covid-19, as the U.S. death toll passed 500,000 Monday.<br />“We often hear people described as ordinary Americans. There’s no such thing, there’s nothing ordinary about them,” Mr. Biden said during a speech at the White House. “People we lost were extraordinary. They spanned generations, born in America, emigrated to America. Just like that, so many of them took their final breath alone in America.”<br />“As a nation, we can’t accept such a cruel fate,” he said.<br />The president’s somber speech came after the number of U.S. deaths surpassed a half-million, with more than 1,200 fatalities reported on Sunday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly a year ago, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.<br />“We have been fighting this pandemic for so long. We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow. We have to resist viewing each life as a statistic,” Mr. Biden said, as he referenced the grief he felt after the deaths of his wife, daughter and son. “That black hole in your chest, you feel like you’re being sucked into it. The survivor’s remorse, the anger.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The families of three service members killed and 13 others injured in a shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola in 2019 sued Saudi Arabia, alleging that the Gulf kingdom should have known the gunman, a member of the Saudi air force, was a threat.<br />The complaint, filed in federal court in Pensacola, Fla., on Monday, asks the court to find that Saudi Arabia is liable and seeks damages for the attack.<br />Mohammed Alshamrani, a 21-year-old second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force identified as the shooter, was stationed at the Pensacola base as part of a training program. He was killed during the attack.<br />The three Navy men killed were Cameron Walters, 21, Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, and Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23.<br />“Al-Shamrani was a Trojan Horse sent by his country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” the lawsuit says. The suit also accuses the Saudi government of failing to follow through on a promise to compensate the victims.</td>

      <td>U.S. Supreme Court removed a hurdle for criminal probe when it rejected former president’s efforts to block subpoena for his financial records</td>
      <td>Manhattan prosecutors won a significant court victory in their fraud investigation into Donald Trump’s businesses after the U.S. Supreme Court denied the former president’s attempt to block a subpoena of his financial records.<br />Prosecutors had argued in court filings that Mr. Trump’s effort to keep his tax and financial records secret posed a significant obstacle to their complex financial investigation into possible bank, insurance and tax fraud. Now, the district attorney’s office will likely get the records from Mr. Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA LLP, within days, former prosecutors said.<br />Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance’s office hasn’t said publicly what it hopes to find in Mr. Trump’s tax records.  Former prosecutors said they may want to compare information on the tax records with documents they have already obtained. Mr. Vance’s office has subpoenaed information from Mr. Trump’s lenders and an insurer. Prosecutors also subpoenaed the New York City Tax Commission, which handles tax appeals, a city spokeswoman confirmed.<br />They may be looking for discrepancies between information submitted to tax authorities and financial institutions, which could point investigators to possible red flags. Knowingly submitting false information to a financial institution, and obtaining certain loans as a result, can be a New York state crime, former prosecutors said.<br />Investigators could be looking for “disparities that would show that on one hand, Trump was telling the IRS that he was completely broke, and on the other hand, telling financial institutions he was extremely rich,” said Duncan Levin, a former Manhattan prosecutor who isn’t involved in the current investigation and now works at the firm Tucker Levin.</td>

      <td>Developers negotiating deals for a $15 billion modernization of John F. Kennedy International Airport were thrown a lifeline Monday when New York City extended the airport’s lease to 2060.<br />Plans to redevelop the airport in Queens stalled last year as the coronavirus pandemic decimated passenger numbers and airline revenue world-wide.<br />The airport’s operator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, has spent the past year renegotiating deals with private-sector consortiums of airlines, terminal operators and developers, who were expected to finance more than $10 billion of the redevelopment plans.<br />But the negotiations were hampered by the airport lease, which was set to expire in 2050, leaving investors with too little time to complete lengthy construction projects, recoup costs and make a profit.<br />Seth Lehman, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said Mayor Bill de Blasio’s decision Monday to extend the lease by 10 years should help developers secure financing and continue the airport’s modernization.</td>

      <td>The Justices demur on a case over Pennsylvania’s 10,000 late ballots.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court on Monday declined to rein in last year’s judicial rewrite of Pennsylvania election law, despite three dissenting votes. What a missed opportunity to prevent future mischief. President Biden won by enough votes in enough states that this case wouldn’t change the outcome. But it could have cut the odds of a meltdown next time.<br />“Changing the rules in the middle of the game is bad enough,” Justice Clarence Thomas writes in his solo dissent. “Such rule changes by officials who may lack authority to do so is even worse.” The Constitution gives state legislatures the power to decide the “manner” of elections, but courts and officials last year ignored black-letter law.<br />Pennsylvania legislators unambiguously said mail ballots were due by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3. Yet the state Supreme Court, gesturing at a vague guarantee of “free and equal” elections, ruled that late-arriving votes would be valid through Nov. 6, even without proof of when they were mailed. In total, 10,097 tardy ballots showed up, 669 lacking legible postmarks. That’s plenty to create havoc in a tighter election.<br />In Minnesota, a Democratic state official settled a lawsuit from a progressive group by agreeing to accept mailed ballots a week past the legal deadline. Five days before Nov. 3, a federal court ordered those ballots—2,460 arrived and were counted, plus 802 rejected for still being late—kept separate, in case they had to be tossed. In other states, deadlines were extended and reverted by different judges.<br />Voters might not know which instructions to follow. Both campaigns might declare victory, which is what happened in a Pennsylvania state Senate race amid a dispute over undated ballots, as Justice Thomas recounts. “The decision to leave election law hidden beneath a shroud of doubt is baffling,” he writes.</td>
