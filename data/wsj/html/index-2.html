      <td>Proceedings to highlight Republicans’ split over former president’s actions, party’s future</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The House sent over the article of impeachment of former President Donald Trump to the Senate Monday evening, officially starting the countdown to a trial expected to highlight the rifts within the GOP over Mr. Trump’s legacy and his future influence over the party.<br />The House impeachment managers, who will act as the prosecutors in Mr. Trump’s second impeachment trial, walked through the Capitol to deliver the article, which alleges he incited a mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />The proceedings leading up to the trial in the Senate, where a two-thirds supermajority will be needed to convict Mr. Trump, coincide with a moment of intense internal wrestling within the Republican Party. Some GOP lawmakers have criticized Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and actions and called on the party to change direction, while loyalists to Mr. Trump have sought to keep Republicans in line behind the former president, who is popular with the party’s base.<br />“There is only one question at stake, only one question, that senators of both parties will have to answer before God and their own conscience,” said Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y) on the floor of the Senate.  “Is former President Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection against the United States?”<br />Spokespeople for Mr. Trump didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.</td>

      <td>Democrats want to punish the ex-President but may revive him.</td>
      <td>Democrats can’t let go of Donald Trump even as a former President, so on Monday House managers walked their article of impeachment to the Senate for a trial. Their goal is to banish Mr. Trump from running for office again. The result may instead be his acquittal and political revival.<br />Democrats have already forced one impeachment trial, resulting in acquittal and no notable decline in his political standing. He lost the election due to his handling of Covid and its consequences. But now Democrats want to do it once more with feeling, after Mr. Trump urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on Jan. 6 with a goal of overturning the Electoral College vote for Joe Biden.<br />We’ve said Mr. Trump’s actions—and failure to act to stop the riot as it unfolded—were an impeachable offense and urged him to resign. But now he is out of office and no longer the “imminent threat” that House Democrats said justified their rushed impeachment. The question is what good purpose a Senate trial will serve, and that isn’t apparent.<br />The Democratic case is that Mr. Trump must be punished lest any future President try something similar in his final days. A conviction by two-thirds of the Senate would also open him to a majority vote barring Mr. Trump from running for public office again. But what if he is acquitted?<br />One problem is whether such a trial is even constitutional. We’ve run op-eds arguing pro and con. The language in the Constitution refers to impeachment against a President while in office, and Mr. Trump is now a private citizen. Chief Justice John Roberts doesn’t seem to believe he needs to preside over the trial because the Constitution stipulates that role for the Chief only for a President. Senior Democrat Pat Leahy will preside instead.</td>

IAC shareholders will receive a proportionate amount of Vimeo stock, the company said.<br />Vimeo has seen a surge of revenue as businesses rely more on the internet to reach customers during the coronavirus pandemic. December marked its highest month of revenue growth, increasing 57% year over year, IAC said.</td>

      <td>Even a federal bribe isn’t enough to get them back teaching in classrooms.</td>
      <td>The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) this weekend vetoed Joe Biden’s plan to reopen schools during his first 100 days by voting to continue remote learning indefinitely. The union is taking kids hostage to extract more money from Congress with no guarantee that it will release them if it does.<br />Chicago’s Board of Education had required K-8 teachers to show up at schools on Monday to prepare for a return to in-person instruction on Feb. 1. The union doesn’t care. Seventy-one percent of CTU voting members rejected a return to in-person learning until schools are “safe”—meaning whenever teachers feel like going back.<br />The district has installed air purifiers in classrooms, conducted ventilation tests, increased cleaning and procured rapid testing, among other things. It will begin vaccinating teachers next month. There’s no excuse for teachers not to return to classrooms.<br />“Students in over 130 private and parochial schools and over 2,000 early learning centers across the city have been safely learning in their classrooms since the fall, and we must provide that same option to our families who, through no fault of their own, have been unable to make remote learning work for their children,” Chicago Public Schools said. “We’ve seen grades, attendance, and enrollment drop significantly for many of our students in recent months, and the impact has been felt most by our Black and Latinx students.”<br />After the union vote, the district postponed teachers’ start-date until Wednesday to provide time “to resolve our discussions without risking disruption to student learning.” Haven’t district leaders read the children’s book “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie”? Accommodating unreasonable demands leads to more unreasonable demands.</td>

      <td>China’s President sweet-talks liberal leaders as he threatens Taiwan.</td>
      <td>Chinese President Xi Jinping knows his audience. In his Monday address to the World Economic Forum, the annual meeting of global luminaries in Davos, Mr. Xi sounded like a liberal internationalist in good standing. He pulled out all the buzzwords that make Davosians swoon: “inclusive growth,” “green development,” “global governance” and “consensus building.”<br />The Davos website effused that this was a “historic opportunity for collaboration.” But Mr. Xi’s People’s Liberation Army told a different story over the weekend, menacing Taiwan with back-to-back military flyovers of more than a dozen planes. The provocation is a reminder that while the government has changed hands in Washington, it hasn’t in Beijing, which still sees extending sovereignty over Taiwan—possibly by force—as a priority.<br />Mr. Xi said in his speech that “the strong should not bully the weak,” but that admonition doesn’t seem to apply to his own government. “We should stay committed to international law and international rules, instead of seeking one’s own supremacy,” he added. Tell that to the people of Hong Kong who were promised autonomy through 2047 in a treaty Beijing signed with Britain but are now being arrested for even mild political dissent.<br />Judging from comments by Secretary of State nominee Tony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in their Senate hearings, the new Administration seems to recognize the importance of Taiwan’s independence and U.S. predominance in the Western Pacific.<br />Yet many in the Administration are also true believers in the types of global-governance values Mr. Xi claimed to endorse in his Davos speech, which they see as the best way to solve problems like climate change. Unlike Mr. Xi, they aren’t experienced in using those values as a shield to relentlessly push their own national interest.</td>

The man was beaten and cut with an unknown object, and suffered slashes to his head, torso and hand, the officials said. The suspects then took the man’s clothes and cell phone before fleeing in private vehicles, the officials said.<br />The victim, who is from Brooklyn, was transported to Manhattan’s Bellevue Hospital, where he was in stable condition.<br />A NYPD spokeswoman said Monday that investigators were still working to determine the motive of the suspects.

      <td>Spending packages need triggers to sustain aid when the recovery lags and cut it off when things improve.</td>
      <td>President Biden has proposed a bold and ambitious $1.9 trillion plan for economic recovery. The plan would benefit from one important change: It should be contingent on the pace of recovery. The Biden plan provides substantial support for the economy through the end of September but essentially ends on that date. It could be improved by including provisions that automatically continue assistance as long as the economy is weak and needs it. In exchange, these provisions could also phase out aid more quickly than Mr. Biden proposes if the economy rebounds faster than expected. Most important, this recession insurance should be made permanent to mitigate future recessions.<br />The economy is more than 11 million jobs short of where it should be, and important labor-market indicators have steadily worsened since the summer, including long-term unemployment and the number of unemployed workers not on temporary layoff. The supply-side constraints created by the virus are the biggest limit on the economy. Aggressive deployment of vaccines plus testing and other measures will likely solve the supply problem over the coming months.<br />A full recovery will require more than open restaurants. People must also be able to afford to eat in those restaurants. That’s where the demand side comes in: The Biden plan would provide relief for many of the households that need it most, including low-income families and the unemployed, turbocharging demand to meet the expanded supply.<br />Covid has had an unprecedented impact on both supply and demand. Anyone who ventures a confident prediction about the course of jobs, inflation or any other aspect of the economy may be wrong and is certainly wrong to be confident.<br />The pace and magnitude of virus mutations raise the concern that the virus will become immune to current vaccines. The ossification of unemployment could make the last phases of the recovery slower and more painful as people are unable to return to their old jobs quickly and may need to find new ones in different industries. Global events could disrupt the U.S. economy. For all of these reasons more rescue and relief may be needed long after September.</td>

      <td>In the race to vaccinate people for Covid-19, everyone agrees front-line health workers, the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions should get priority. But one vital group is being overlooked. Even worse, some are criticizing efforts to vaccinate them as some sort of effort to “cut the line.”<br />I’m referring to the thousands of people working to produce critical vaccines, medications and diagnostics for Covid-19. In addition to  Pfizer  and Moderna, my company,  Emergent BioSolutions ,  has been ramping up manufacturing of hundreds of millions of vaccine doses for partners like  Johnson & Johnson  and  AstraZeneca  in close coordination with the federal government.<br />Emergent’s employees are essential to the Covid-19 response, and we have gone to extraordinary lengths to protect them. Unfortunately, our strict safety protocols, like the use of personal protective equipment, disinfection of work areas and regular testing, are no guarantee against infection.<br />Over the past year, we have quarantined hundreds of team members—nearly one-third of our small on-site workforce. Some were exposed outside the workplace, but the primary cause of quarantine is potential exposure to an infected fellow employee. This situation puts a tremendous strain on our 24/7 operations. Absenteeism means other employees have to work multiple back-to-back shifts to avoid a manufacturing shutdown. So far, we’ve avoided delays in vaccine production, but the risk is real—we briefly had to slow down operations at another facility because of Covid-related absenteeism.<br />This situation also can create a national-security risk. In addition to Covid-19 vaccines, Emergent produces medical countermeasures for deadly threats like anthrax, botulism and smallpox. This manufacturing can’t simply be turned on and off. That’s why the Department of Homeland Security has designated Emergent as a part of America’s critical national-security infrastructure in cases of emergency.</td>

I fear the work of four decades won’t survive the coming months without a plan that truly addresses my industry’s needs.<br />In April I sat down with my wife, 22-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son and told them we may lose some, or all, of the six restaurants and two bars we owned. In the same conversation, I told them there was also a strong chance we might have to sell our home.<br />Nearly a year into the pandemic, I have permanently closed two restaurants and a bar—leaving 52 people to have difficult conversations with their own families. For the first time in my career, I have to ask for help.<br />The pandemic is unfair. A tiny airborne particle threatens everything I’ve spent 40 years working to build.

      <td>Nations decide which problems to solve through politics. Global elites already know what problems need solving. Just ask them.</td>
      <td>Refugee Run is an immersive theatrical experience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which billionaires and other global elites pretend to be refugees for a little over an hour. In one promotional video, corporate executives wearing $1,000 loafers “escape” their “village” and make their way to a “refugee camp,” where they must “bribe” actors playing camp guards. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg flashes on-screen to attest: “I found it incredible . . . that you can put yourself in a room like this and feel as much as you feel.” This focus on eliciting emotional responses from the wealthy and powerful at an Alpine ski resort, rather than providing material assistance to actual refugees, makes Refugee Run an appropriate charity for the Davos set.<br />The founder and executive chairman of the Davos forum is Klaus Schwab, a German engineer and former academic. Mr. Schwab is a prominent evangelist for the virtues of “stakeholder capitalism,” the belief that corporations answer notjust to shareholders—that’s ordinary capitalism—but to communities, marginalized minorities and society in general. This vision for capitalism has steadily become the dominant philosophy among Western business elites and even some Republicans.<br />Mr. Schwab argues in “Stakeholder Capitalism: A Global Economy That Works for Progress, People and Planet” that to make the world a better place captains of industry must work together to solve global problems. “Building such a virtuous economic system is not a utopian ideal,” he writes. “Most people want to do good. But what’s been missing in recent decades is a clear compass to guide those in leading positions in our society and economy.” Mr. Schwab believes that he possesses such a compass.<br />Unfortunately, his compass points in multiple directions. In lieu of mere profit, Schwab argues that businesses should pursue the four P’s: Principles of Governance, Planet, People and Prosperity. He offers no guiding principle for how these vague, expansive and competing interests ought to be weighed and weighted.<br />Like other stakeholder proponents, Mr. Schwab cherry-picks examples to support his claim that shareholder capitalism is somehow ignoble or prone to disaster rather than deriving his claims from the totality of available examples. He predictably invokes Enron but fails to mention Volkswagen, Wirecard or Wells Fargo—examples of large-scale fraud perpetuated by executives who long escaped scrutiny in part by ostentatiously championing fashionable social causes.</td>

      <td>California wants to do it, and Biden wants to help—even though it will violate the law and cost us all.</td>
      <td>President Biden can’t mandate that we all drive electric cars, but he’s opening the gates to an electric Trojan horse. In a day-one executive order, Mr. Biden began the process of rescinding a Trump administration rule, the first step toward greenlighting California’s electric car agenda. California and like-minded states plan to impose electric cars through production quotas—whether drivers want the cars or not.<br />California regulators call it a “zero-emissions vehicle” standard, but green propaganda shouldn’t obscure what’s really going on. Start with federal law. It requires the transportation secretary to set national average fuel-economy performance standards for car makers at the “maximum feasible” level without restricting consumer choice. Instead of mandating a given technology, federal fuel-economy standards allow car makers the freedom to decide how best to improve fuel economy at the lowest cost.<br />To promote efficiency, federal law broadly forbids state regulations “related to fuel economy standards.” Courts have held that this law forbids electric car quotas and similarly meddlesome command-and-control policies that seek to dictate how car makers should meet federal performance standards. The Golden State argues that a special exception made for California regulations in the Clean Air Act should also be read into the federal fuel-economy law. But that law’s text says no. It forbids fuel-economy regulation by any state—no exceptions.<br />Next, the policy. Congress pre-empted state laws in 1975 because sprinkling policies like state electric car quotas on top of federal fuel-economy standards makes no sense. An electric car quota in California would force car makers to meet national fuel-economy standards using one of the most expensive fuel-efficiency technologies, undermining consumer choice and increasing costs. One study from 2019 estimates that state electric car quotas will cost an extra $400 for every new car nationwide by 2025.<br />Those costs won’t be distributed equally. The zero-emission vehicle standard is in effect a hidden regressive tax paid by ordinary car buyers to subsidize luxury cars for the wealthy. It takes $400 from the wallets of low- and moderate-income car buyers and hands it over primarily to six-figure-income electric car buyers, who enjoy many other subsidies, too.</td>

      <td>Long Island City, N.Y.<br />Performance artist and director Elliot Reed, at MoMA PS1 as part of “This Longing Vessel: The Studio Museum Artist in Residence 2019-20,” offers a handsome array of his two-dimensional, three-dimensional and video work that can be viewed, four gallery-goers at a time, on the museum’s second floor. “This Longing Vessel” (which also includes work by E. Jane and Naudline Pierre and is associated with MoMA PS1’s multiyear partnership with Harlem’s Studio Museum) is promoted as presenting “the intersection between queerness and Blackness as a waypoint to yearn from, reach toward and leap beyond.”<br />For his part, Mr. Reed offers a gallery with two high-gloss aluminum signs, one emblazoned with the word “BLOOD,” the other with “NUDITY”; an empty track suit laid out on a bed of salt; and a five-screen video display with Mr. Reed at its center, flanked by the four musicians of the JACK string quartet. Mr. Reed gesticulates and recites a text, which can be read in full at mo.ma/elliotreed, in which he muses on both contemporary and historical criminal acts targeting Black victims—a “real-life horror story.” The musicians take their cues from some of Mr. Reed’s readings. And now, as launched on Saturday and continuing on Feb. 6, Feb. 20 and March 6, Mr. Reed is presenting a series of “Duets” in PS1’s converted school building, in places inaccessible to museum visitors.<br />Each excursion, streamed to video screens in the museum and on MoMA’s website, as well as to PS1’s Instagram account, will have Mr. Reed and an invited artist improvise an hour-long performance aimed at, according to MoMA’s online calendar, “reinterpreting COVID-19 precautions as a formal challenge.” In the first, Mr. Reed was joined by dancer-choreographer Raymond Pinto. The Feb. 6 duet will include choreographer Ishmael Houston-Jones; the one on Feb. 20, performance artist Ron Athey; and the final one a collaborator still to be decided.<br />The initial performance unfolded as gently poetic rather than strongly polemical. Except for passing references to asbestos and mesothelioma as Mr. Pinto and Mr. Reed maneuvered together under some insulated pipes of the museum’s furnace room, their duet was a mostly playful one in which the two men, in janitor-style coveralls explored their confines and exchanged thoughts while maintaining social distance in the lower reaches of PS1.</td>

      <td>Leon Black plans to step down as chief executive of  Apollo Global Management Inc.  after an independent review revealed larger-than-expected payments to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein that it nevertheless deemed justified.<br />The monthslong review by Dechert LLP found no evidence that Mr. Black was involved in the criminal activities of the late Epstein, who was indicted in 2019 on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls, according to a copy of the law firm’s report that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />In its report, Dechert found the fees that the billionaire had paid Epstein were for legitimate advice on trust- and estate-tax planning that proved to be of significant value to Mr. Black and his family. Mr. Black paid Epstein a total of $148 million, plus a $10 million donation to his charity—far more than was previously known.<br />Mr. Black wrote in a letter to Apollo’s fund investors that he would cede the role of CEO to co-founder Marc Rowan on or before his 70th birthday on July 31 while retaining the role of chairman. In the letter, a copy of which was viewed by the Journal, Mr. Black detailed other governance changes he is recommending to the board, including the appointment of more independent directors and the elimination of Apollo’s dual-class share structure.<br />Mr. Black also pledged to donate $200 million of his family’s money to women’s initiatives.</td>

By 1997’s “The Colour and the Shape,” Mr. Grohl had recruited members and Foo Fighters has been a full-fledged band since, one with two primary modes—dynamic hard rock, where brooding verses lead to anthemic choruses driven by power chords, and hushed ballads, where acoustic arrangements provide contrast. Unlike some of their ’90s peers, Foo Fighters has never embarrassed itself—there have been no ill-advised genre exercises à la Weezer, no indulgent multi-disc concept albums à la the Smashing Pumpkins. But Foo Fighters has never transcended down-the-middle rock, either. The group experiments within clearly defined parameters, which is both a strength and a weakness.</td>

      <td>ROME—Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is set to resign on Tuesday, his office said, as Europe’s underlying problems of economic stagnation and political fragmentation start to reassert themselves amid the gruelling pandemic.<br />The fall of Italy’s government, in office for just 17 months, is a symptom of the continuing fissures in Italian and European politics. Established and insurgent parties are struggling over Europe’s future, stable majorities are often elusive and leaders are searching for ways to overcome long-term economic underperformance—nowhere more so than in Italy.<br />Rome’s latest political breakdown is likely to cause concern in the capitals of Europe’s stronger economies, such as Germany, which last year agreed to underwrite a massive European Union investment plan for economic recovery from the coronavirus.<br />Italy, due to receive more than €200 billion in EU funds, the equivalent of about $243 billion, is the plan’s biggest beneficiary. But Italian leaders’ inability to agree on a coherent economic strategy reduces the chances that the EU’s third-biggest economy will use the funds effectively.<br />At stake is not just Italy’s chances of escaping from its long economic decline, and of stabilizing its sky-high national debt, but also the political trust between northern and southern Europe that the euro needs for its long-term viability.</td>

The strains appear to be spreading around the world, prompting U.S. health authorities to warn the variant first detected in the U.K. could become dominant by March.<br />The variant first found in South Africa hasn’t been detected in the U.S., Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top-infectious disease expert, said Sunday. To curb the spread of new strains into the U.S., President Biden on Monday restricted travel from South Africa and re-established a ban on most travel into the U.S. from Europe, the U.K. and Brazil.</td>

Mining that vein has paid off in a new way for the 68-year-old action star during the pandemic. He has scored two No. 1 movies in the last three months, by supplying multiplexes with much-needed new releases and audiences willing to turn out for his brand of movie.<br />“Maybe these stories hark back to a simpler time of a man taking on evil people in a very basic, fundamental fashion,” Mr. Neeson said in an email.<br />In “The Marksman,” released Jan. 15, he stars as a hardscrabble Arizona rancher who protects a boy who crosses the border illegally with his mother to escape a Mexican crime cartel. Ticket sales were strongest in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Florida and Texas. The film, made for about $30 million, is now in its second week as the highest grossing movie, with total ticket sales of $6.1 million—in the one-third of domestic theaters currently open. A similar pattern played out in October (when more theaters were open) for the release of “Honest Thief,” featuring Mr. Neeson as a bank robber double-crossed by FBI agents.

The Wall Street Journal also reported that Mr. Trump pushed the Justice Department to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate Mr. Biden’s win.<br />Inspector General Michael Horowitz said in a statement that his office will probe “whether any former or current DOJ official engaged in an improper attempt to have DOJ seek to alter the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election,” adding only that the investigation will “encompass all allegations that may arise that are within the scope” of its jurisdiction.<br />Mr. Trump’s persistent efforts to involve the Justice Department in his attempts to undo the outcome of the November election failed due to pushback from his own appointees in the department, people familiar with the matter have said. The efforts have drawn sharp rebuke from Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), who announced Saturday that the Senate Judiciary Committee has initiated its own review of Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign at the Justice Department.<br />As part of that effort, Mr. Trump explored a plan to replace then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen with another senior Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, an ally who had expressed a willingness to use the department’s power to help the former president continue his unsuccessful legal battles contesting the election results, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump and other politicians have called on Congress numerous times to revoke Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. During the lame-duck congress, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even introduced a bill tying increased stimulus payments to the repeal of Section 230.<br />They’re rightly concerned about political bias and censorship by social-media companies. A 2020 survey by Pew Research found that 75% of Americans (including most conservatives and liberals alike) believe  Facebook  and  Twitter  censor political views. It is clear that social media must change before it destroys free speech, privacy and democracy. The problem is that revoking Section 230 would exacerbate censorship and reduce the competition that is the real solution.<br />I’m CEO of MeWe, a social network that competes directly with Facebook. We have millions of members, people of all political persuasions. Revoking Section 230 would significantly harm smaller companies like mine and new startups that compete with the tech giants.<br />Enacted in 1996, Section 230 is the legislation that protects social media and web companies, big or small, from liability for content posted by users. The law makes it possible for modestly funded or self-funded startups to enter the market and compete with bigger companies. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called it “the most important law protecting internet speech.”<br />Those who want to get rid of Section 230 say this would stop social networks and websites from unfairly censoring their users’ political comments. In reality, it would give them an incentive to censor far more aggressively. To protect themselves from being sued over content, they would remove anything remotely controversial. Users would be spied on constantly.</td>

The safest conclusion to draw is that it is too early to draw a conclusion.<br />Mr. Biden, of course, campaigned as a centrist in a party that generally has moved to the left. “Biden won the nomination because he’s a moderate, not despite it,” says Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, an organization of centrist Democrats. “And he won the election as a moderate.”<br />Some Republicans, though, argue that Mr. Biden already has abandoned that center ground in his early actions and initiatives. “Some of these are far left-of-center ideas,” asserted Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida on Fox News Sunday. “He may use the language, the rhetoric, even the demeanor of a centrist, but so far his policies don’t seem to represent that.”<br />As evidence, Republicans cite Mr. Biden’s unprecedented burst of executive orders reversing Trump administration policies, including on immigration, gender identity in schools and transgender people in the military; the hefty $1.9 trillion price tag on his proposed coronavirus aid and stimulus plan; his inclusion of a $15 minimum wage proposal within that plan; his immediate decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada’s oil-sands region; and his appointment of some aggressive financial regulators.</td>

      <td>The Cares Act wasn’t entirely humanitarian aid and didn’t stimulate growth. Increasing the amount to $2,000 won’t make a difference.</td>
      <td>John F. Cogan and John B. Taylor (“Those $2,000 Checks Won’t Boost the Economy,” op-ed, Jan. 15) are correct to note that much of this deficit spending will be saved, not spent. This is what we should expect when checks go to households with twice the median income. If spending is humanitarian aid for those who suffer most from the pandemic, it makes more sense to send checks only to households with incomes below the median or to people who have been unemployed for more than some number of months; the longer the period of unemployment, the larger the check.<br />Messrs. Cogan and Taylor also are correct in noting that the Cares Act did nothing to stimulate economic growth. This isn’t surprising. Economists know that fiscal and monetary policy actions can’t increase an economy’s growth rate.<br />Economic growth is determined by the growth rates of labor, real capital and productivity. The growth rate of labor is determined by immigration and the labor-force participation rate. The latter trended up until about 2000 when it began trending down. Investing in plant and equipment happens because investors expect very high rates of return. They won’t invest less because the borrowing rate is 8% rather than 5%, nor will they invest more if the borrowing rate drops from 5% to 2%. Productivity is driven by technology, which is why there was a decadelong increase in productivity growth that began in the mid-1990s.<br />The Cares Act wasn’t entirely humanitarian aid and didn’t stimulate growth. Increasing the amount to $2,000 won’t make a difference.<br />Dan Thornton</td>

      <td>In “No, You Can’t Try an Impeached Former President” (op-ed, Jan. 21), Prof. Alan Dershowitz makes some technical arguments against the ability of the Senate to hold an impeachment trial against now former-President Trump. Fair enough, but when he discusses precedents, which are very rare, his attempt fails when he frames the nonimpeachment of Richard Nixon, who “left office in 1974 to avoid certain impeachment and conviction, there was no movement to continue the process.”<br />Though the Nixon episode is similar to President Trump’s, it is hardly a precedent. The glaring difference is that Nixon resigned the presidency, rather than face, and put the country through, the ordeal of impeachment. President Trump adamantly refused to resign the presidency, or even to concede the election. Had President Trump resigned, as Nixon did, the House likely wouldn’t have pursued impeachment.<br />Finally, Mr. Dershowitz states that: “For the victorious Democrats to seek revenge against Donald Trump would set a terrible precedent.” In this case, there are many in Congress from both parties who have a much different perspective than ours, having experienced the violence on Jan. 6. Even if the Senate doesn’t have a trial now that Mr. Trump is no longer in office, he should at minimum be censured for his goading the mob violence that day.<br />Russell Bratburd<br />Pleasant Hill, Calif.</td>

      <td>Delays in Covid-19 vaccine deliveries and uncertainties about the prospects of yet-to-be-approved shots mean Europe is unlikely to have inoculated a substantial portion of its population by the summer, raising the specter of many more months of lockdowns and other restrictions.<br />The fading hope for a swift return to normalcy compared with countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. that are farther along in vaccination spells trouble for the region’s economy. Large parts of it depend on services, including travel and tourism, especially in the less-affluent south.<br />The European Commission, the European Union’s executive body, which procures vaccines centrally for the bloc, has ordered 2.3 billion doses from six manufacturers. It says most of these are expected to be delivered in 2021, and that member states should be able to vaccinate 70% of adults among the bloc’s 448 million inhabitants by the summer.<br />But delivery delays and manufacturing hiccups by two large manufacturers threaten this plan, as does uncertainty about when other vaccines the EU is relying on will be approved. Meantime, governments in the region are struggling to bring down case numbers and deaths despite tight restrictions on the population.<br />Ten days ago,  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  which have sold 600 million doses of their vaccine to the EU, making them the continent’s largest provider, said they would temporarily reduce deliveries in the bloc because of an upgrade to their plant in Belgium, though they promised to deliver all the doses owed in the first quarter.</td>

      <td>The House of Representatives impeached then President Donald Trump a second time, for his role in inciting the capitol riots on Jan. 6, just over a year after it first impeached him for pressing Ukraine to announce investigations that would have aided him politically. The vote was 232 to 197, with all Democrats joined by 10 Republicans, in a House chamber guarded by National Guard troops stationed throughout the Capitol and its grounds.<br />Speaker Nancy Pelosi was set to send over the article of impeachment to the Senate on Monday evening, triggering the start of the impeachment trial. While senators will be sworn in as jurors this week, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have agreed to start the trial the week of Feb. 8 to allow both sides more time to prepare. Mr. Trump has hired at least one lawyer to defend him, South Carolina-based attorney Butch Bowers, while Mrs. Pelosi has named a team of House impeachment managers. Here’s how the unprecedented process is playing out.<br />The Constitution gives broad leeway to the House of Representatives to handle the impeachment process. There are no limits on the number of times someone may be impeached, though Mr. Trump is the first person ever to be impeached more than once.<br />Because President Biden has already taken office, the practical effects of the second impeachment by the House are mostly symbolic. The Senate, if it successfully convicts Mr. Trump, can’t remove him from an office he doesn’t hold.<br />But the Senate could immediately hold a follow-up vote, subject only to a simple majority, to ban Mr. Trump—who has weighed another presidential run in 2024—from ever seeking office again. Those are the only punishments the Senate can consider as part of an impeachment conviction. A Senate conviction after Mr. Trump has left office wouldn’t affect his postpresidential benefits, which include a pension and Secret Service protection.</td>

Dr. O’Connor was Mr. Biden’s physician during his time as vice president and prepared his medical report during the 2020 campaign, declaring the then-candidate “healthy” and “vigorous.”<br />It isn’t uncommon for new presidents to choose their own physicians, although Mr. Trump initially retained Dr. Ronny Jackson, a Navy rear admiral who served in the role under former President Barack Obama. A White House physician is typically responsible for the medical care of the president, the first family and White House staff.<br />Although the position is typically low-profile, both Dr. Jackson and Dr. Conley drew scrutiny for what some said were overly rosy assessments of Mr. Trump’s health. Dr. Conley also faced criticism for providing conflicting information about Mr. Trump’s condition when he was diagnosed with coronavirus in the fall.<br />Dr. Jackson was subsequently nominated by Mr. Trump to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, but he withdrew from consideration amid allegations of misconduct while serving as the president’s personal physician.

The disclosures, which are dated Jan. 22, showed Mr. Walsh had assets such as holdings in stock and bond funds, life insurance policies and bank accounts valued at between $350,000 and $950,000. The disclosure forms use ranges rather than specific amounts.<br />The forms showed Mr. Walsh had between $500,000 and $1 million in liabilities from two mortgage loans on a personal residence.<br />The government disclosures show Mr. Walsh is participating in two retirement plans through unions that would make him eligible for payments of a combined $1,998 a month starting at age 60. Mr. Walsh is also participating in a retirement plan through the city of Boston that would make him eligible for monthly payments of $9,769.17 a month starting at age 65. The value of the retirement accounts was “not readily ascertainable,” according to the disclosures.<br />Before serving as mayor, Mr. Walsh led the Greater Boston Building Trades Unions, an umbrella organization comprised of 20 local construction unions, and was president of Laborers Local Union 223. Those organizations fall under the AFL-CIO federation of labor unions, and its leader, Richard Trumka, advocated for Mr. Walsh’s nomination to become labor secretary.</td>

Fashion shows have always gazed toward the future, serving up novelties that won’t trickle into stores for months and months. These particular clothes should land sometime around September or October and, in various ways, suggest what we might be wearing this fall.<br />To begin with, they posit that we’re unlikely to cast aside the comfortable loungewear of quarantine. Designers seemed soberly aware that many of their customers have been living in soft pants and slouchy, couch-potato hoodies for most of 2020.<br />In Prada’s presentation, you could see the potent influence of at-home wear in the knit long johns the models wore beneath their outfits. In some cases, the long johns comprised the entire outfit—the models evocative of successful 20-something Twitch streamers, dressed for a rousing day of video games. Or even kids scurrying downstairs in patterned footie PJs to watch Saturday-morning cartoons.<br />Other brands strove for a more balanced, present-meets-future mix—imbuing relatively traditional garments with an easy, at-home feel. Parisian label Lemaire showed a serene array of slouchy, earth-toned dress shirts, trousers and even sportcoats in delicate fabrics that suggested pajamas. The models in the video presentation were hardly couch-bound though: They marched about with purpose, reminding us that someday soon we’ll all have in-person meetings to hurry into again.</td>

Mr. Ryu’s defection in 2019 occurred just two months after Pyongyang’s acting ambassador to Rome, Jo Song Gil, defected to Seoul.<br />The number of recent ambassador-level defections from North Korea shows Kim Jong Un’s control over the regime’s bureaucracy may not be as strong as his father’s or grandfather’s, said Cheon Seong-whun, a former South Korean national security official. However, he cautioned against reading too much into the defections as a sign of the regime’s fragility.<br />“We should be wary of interpreting the series of defections as a sign of weakness of the Kim Jong Un regime,” Mr. Cheon said. Most North Koreans have a tendency to rally around their leader against outside pressure, he said.</td>

      <td>Charts show the U.K. economy came into the coronavirus pandemic weaker than its peers after years of uncertainty over Brexit. Then, it was hurt more by shutdowns because of its dependence on recreational spending for growth.</td>
      <td>The U.K.’s economy shrank more last year than any of the G-7, in what the Bank of England says will be the country’s biggest economic slump in more than 300 years.<br />What went wrong? Shutdowns caused greater pain for the U.K. than other members of the Group of Seven advanced economies in part because it is especially dependent on consumer spending, which evaporated amid one of Europe’s deadliest Covid-19 outbreaks. The economy was already weak after the four years of negotiations over Britain’s exit from the European Union, during which business investment sagged and households held back on spending.<br />This is the starting point for Britain’s new relationship with the EU, which began Jan. 1 with a loose free-trade agreement. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced another nationwide lockdown to fight a new, more-contagious variant of the coronavirus. That puts the U.K. economy on course to shrink again in the first quarter of the year, when businesses must also get to grips with new European trading arrangements.<br />Growth in the U.K. was already weak going into the pandemic because of feeble business investment, poor productivity and scant growth in incomes. Once the coronavirus set in, the British economy shrank by more than its peers in the G-7 in the first nine months of the year. Figures for the final quarter, due Feb. 12, are expected to show the economy contracted again.<br />The U.K. took a bigger hit because around 13% of its annual gross domestic product comes from spending on recreation and culture and in restaurants and hotels, a higher share than any other G-7 country. Businesses that depend on direct contact with consumers—bars and restaurants, sports events, hotels and theaters, cinemas and museums—were hobbled when social distancing became the norm and when the spread of the virus forced them to close. The current lockdown, in place through mid-February, closes schools and nonessential shops, and people have been told to leave home only if necessary.</td>

Going for it on fourth down used to be a matter of gumption or necessity. Teams that went for it were bold. Or they were behind and had to. The ones that strayed from that script were brash.<br />Now going for it differentiates something else about teams: whether or not they’re making an analytically correct choice.

      <td>U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed open, with technology shares surging higher and pandemic-sensitive stocks broadly lower ahead of a busy week of earnings, including from  Apple ,  Tesla and  Facebook .<br />Securities linked to the Nasdaq 100 advanced 1%, suggesting a rally in tech stocks after the opening bell and an extension to last week’s gains that saw the index notch a new record Friday. Those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5%.<br />“You’re getting rotation out of the more cyclical stocks. These big tech stocks are perceived as a bit of a haven trade,” said Michael Hewson, a chief markets analyst at CMC Markets. “There’s also talk of disruptions to vaccine supply, so we’ll likely have slower vaccine rollout and tighter restrictions for longer. What we’re seeing is a recovery deferred, or delayed.”<br />China’s most valuable internet company,  Tencent Holdings ,  jumped nearly 11% to a record high in Hong Kong trading. Tencent portfolio company Kuaishou Technology, a TikTok-like video-recording app, announced a coming initial public offering that may value it at about $60 billion. Amsterdam-listed shares of tech investment group Prosus, one of Tencent’s biggest shareholders, rose 5.5%.<br />More than one-fifth of the broad S&P 500 index and a third of Dow Jones Industrial Average components are scheduled to release earnings this week.  Starbucks ,   Verizon  and  Microsoft  are slated for Tuesday. Other major tech firms are reporting later in the week, including Apple, Tesla and Facebook on Wednesday.</td>

      <td>The Boy Scouts of America’s liability insurers threw doubt on the huge increase in sex-abuse claims filed against the youth organization after it filed for bankruptcy, claiming that plaintiffs’ attorneys and for-profit claims generators helped gin up tens of thousands of claims with little or no vetting.<br />In Friday court filings, insurers affiliated with  Chubb Ltd.  and  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.  point to messaging such as an email sent in November by the law firm Junell & Associates PLLC, telling clients that “time is quickly running out” to meet a court-designated deadline and that lawyers “can complete a claim form on your behalf,” based on information from an initial phone consultation.<br />Some attorneys, including a managing partner from Junell, signed hundreds of claims in a single day, the insurers said, and others appear to have signed forms attesting to their truthfulness before they were even filled out.<br />The Boy Scouts sought chapter 11 last year over their past failures to safeguard children from sexual predators, starting a court-supervised process in which the organization is trying to compensate survivors while protecting the bulk of its wealth. Negotiations are continuing between victims’ lawyers and the Boy Scouts, which has said it needs a settlement approved by early summer to survive.<br />Mass-tort cases, which involve dangerous products or, in the Boy Scouts’ case, allegations of sexual abuse, have become a big business. Behind every case are marketers, brokers, funders and other third parties that help accumulate claims and pass them off to lawyers. Individual victims or plaintiffs become a commodity that can be bought and sold before finding their way into court or receiving a settlement.</td>

A Google spokesman said such results mean the company is still on track to stop supporting such cookies in Chrome next year, when the new alternatives are expected to be ready.<br />Third-party cookies offer data that can be valuable to advertisers for the purpose of targeting ads, measuring their effectiveness and stopping fraud. But the way they track individuals’ personal browsing has long raised privacy concerns, leading Google to say last year that it would phase them out in 2022.<br />Chrome is the most widely used web browser, with more than 60% of the market globally, according to Statcounter.</td>

Benchmark Senior Living LLC, an operator of assisted-living facilities, is blasting “myth-buster” emails to its workforce and turning on-site vaccination clinics into mini parties, complete with cake and games, to lend a celebratory air. Technology company  VMware Inc.,  meanwhile, is discussing bringing in doctors to answer staff questions about the vaccine in virtual company meetings.<br />Many companies have taken on a stepped-up role in disseminating public-health information to employees during the pandemic. It is unusual terrain for bosses, but surveys have found that people often view their employers as more credible sources of information than government, social media or media outlets.<br />Getting a critical mass of employees vaccinated is crucial to reopening offices and returning workplaces to a semblance of normal, executives say. Yet overcoming vaccine skepticism could prove tough. A recent Siena College Research Institute survey of New York state residents found more than a quarter said they don’t plan to get the shot.</td>

Andrew Cuomo’s $193 billion budget.<br />Aides to the Democratic governor say the proposal could generate an additional $10 million for the state in the fiscal year that starts April 1, and $18 million in subsequent years. Roughly the same amount of money would also flow to local governments around the state, which also levy their own surcharges on top of the state’s 4% sales tax.<br />The proposal was embraced by the group representing the state’s county governments, but it could revive a broader debate about how home-sharing companies are regulated in the state, lawmakers said, which is fueled by different concerns in different parts of the state.<br />“I think it’s now opportune for us to have this larger conversation,” said state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat from Orange County, who favors changing state law to allow for short-term rentals in multifamily buildings.<br />Mr. Cuomo’s proposal doesn’t address registration or change the state’s multiple-dwelling law, which prevents someone from renting an apartment in a building with three or more units for fewer than 30 days unless the apartment’s tenant is also present.</td>

That means avoiding all contact with other people and not leaving home unless you need to go to a medical appointment. If you are asymptomatic and test positive and never develop symptoms, the isolation period should start on the day you took your diagnostic test. You are believed to no longer be contagious after 10 days if you have had no fever—and haven’t taken fever-reducing medication—for at least 24 hours and your symptoms are improving. The CDC recommends that immunocompromised patients and those with severe Covid-19 cases isolate for up to 20 days after symptoms appear.<br /></td>

The buying pressure has led money managers to switch out of substantial bets that the stock would fall, analysts said.<br />This resulted in a short squeeze, in which rising prices prompt investors to buy back shares they had sold short to cut their losses, pushing the stock higher still.</td>

That has helped China to blunt calls for changes to its state-controlled economy, which other members say distort the market.<br />“For the foreseeable future, China will partake actively in WTO discussions and initiatives, without offering major concessions at the negotiating table,” said Harvard University law professor and trade expert Mark Wu.<br />Mr. Biden’s team has said that he would lift the U.S. blockade on judges but that the pandemic and U.S. economic recovery could take precedence over trade.</td>

      <td>Microsoft ’s  videogame business has long involved a delicate dance of pleasing two very different crowds. The company gave a sharp reminder of that just ahead of its quarterly results announcement scheduled for Tuesday.<br />Microsoft announced a series of price changes for its Xbox Live service on Friday. The changes would have effectively doubled the annual rate for new subscribers while allowing existing ones to shift their memberships to the company’s Game Pass service at no extra charge. But a swift outcry from gamers caused the company to backtrack. Microsoft announced on Friday night that it will keep prices the same for Xbox Live Gold members. It even threw in a change that a paid subscription will no longer be required to play free-to-play games, such as the mega-popular Fortnite.<br />The original move seemed to please investors as much as it irked gamers. Microsoft’s share price rose Friday in what was an otherwise tough session for many tech stocks. Gaming was once derided on Wall Street as an expensive distraction for Microsoft. Some analysts even called on Satya Nadella to sell the business after he was named chief executive in early 2014.<br />But Microsoft has instead doubled down, continuing to update its Xbox consoles while investing more in the software and services side. Two of the largest corporate transactions completed under Mr. Nadella’s watch have involved gaming, including last year’s pickup of Bethesda Softworks for $7.5 billion.<br />The launch of the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles last November make this year a big one for Microsoft’s gaming business. The company’s gaming revenue totaled $11.4 billion for the fiscal year ended last June, and analysts are expecting a jump of 17% for the current fiscal year, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The segment’s revenue is expected to rise 26% year over year to $4.2 billion for the fiscal second quarter ended December.</td>

      <td>Small-investor trading activity has stayed super hot in 2021, highlighting the opportunity for big banks to tap into a rare source of growth</td>
      <td>The rising tide of small-investor activity is lifting some very big boats.<br />The surge of everyday investor trading logged in 2020 is continuing into the new year. Analysts at Piper Sandler noted that off-exchange trading—which includes retail volume that goes through wholesale market makers—accounted for a record 48% of the market through the first 11 trading days of January. “We suspect retail trades are on a record pace in January to date,” the analysts wrote last Wednesday.<br />The explosion of market activity by investors of all flavors is one of the biggest trends in financials right now, and not just for digital upstarts such as Robinhood.  Morgan Stanley ,  having completed its acquisition of E*Trade, reported growth of roughly 900,000 net new self-directed accounts for the online broker from the second quarter to the fourth. The hope is that such an influx of new clients can over time boost growth across the bank’s wider wealth platform. Morgan Stanley’s overall wealth network generated $66 billion in net new assets over the fourth quarter.<br />Charles Schwab —now combined with TD Ameritrade—is regularly surpassing its fourth-quarter peak trading day of 7.8 million client trades, hit on Nov. 9. The daily January average through midmonth is running at over 8 million. Though trading might be mostly commission-free, investors are tapping those portfolios as a way of borrowing, for investing and other financing needs. Schwab reported a 16% uptick in average margin loan balances from the third quarter to the fourth. This helped boost net interest revenue and margin at a time when other banks are struggling to keep those numbers level.<br />Day-trader mania for hot stocks and initial public offerings surely plays some part in all of this. But shifts in the environment may be altering how even more sensible investors behave, especially with rates on deposits and money-market funds at remarkable lows.  BlackRock  this month said that growth in its exchange-traded fund business is being driven in part by the move to commission-free wealth management. Last year was a turning point for adoption of fixed-income ETFs, BlackRock said. It added that fixed-income products in its iShares ETF suite generated nearly $90 billion of inflows.</td>

      <td>Strong sales during the pandemic and the Senate flip are easing some of the sector’s old challenges</td>
      <td>The haze is finally clearing for U.S. pot companies.<br />Since Democrats won control of the Senate earlier this month, many in the cannabis industry are betting on a more rapid path to full federal legalization and a pickup in deal making as companies rush to scale up. The Global Cannabis Stock Index, which tracks U.S.-listed marijuana stocks, has climbed 35% since the start of this year.<br />Today’s high expectations look more justified than earlier speculative rallies that left pot investors badly burned. After almost doubling in value in 2017, the index was pummeled for two years as Canadian cannabis companies reported disappointing sales and profit numbers, and black-market dealers proved more resilient than expected.<br />This time, cannabis companies are performing well—particularly big U.S. growers with operations in multiple states. Pot sales have been strong during the pandemic as consumers have spent more time at home and received stimulus checks. In November, grower Cresco Labs reported its third consecutive quarter of revenue growth above 40%. Pot stores also won market share from illegal dealers by letting consumers order online and offering curbside pickup.<br />Progress on this score remains slow: An estimated 78% of U.S. sales still happened in the black market in 2020, according to the cannabis-focused SOJE Fund. States’ thirst for new sources of tax revenue amid the pandemic provides an extra incentive to increase the size of the legal sector. November ballots in Arizona, Montana, South Dakota and New Jersey all approved the legalization of adult use. New York is now weighing a similar move to plug a projected $15 billion budget hole in the current and coming fiscal years.</td>

That may be asking the wrong question—if China takes the top spot at all, it may struggle to keep it for long.<br />Researchers at investment bank Nomura recently suggested that if the yuan were to strengthen further and to hold at around 6 to the dollar, the U.S. economy would be eclipsed by the Chinese economy by 2026.<br />The estimate is based on extrapolating International Monetary Fund estimates of 7.9% nominal GDP growth in 2025 further out into the future, and depends on the assumption that the U.S. economy will remain permanently below its pre-pandemic path. Neither fact, nor continued currency appreciation, is certain. But even leaving the path of the U.S. aside, demographics and productivity trends will make sustaining China’s pre-pandemic growth rates increasingly difficult.<br />Even if fertility trends improved overnight, China’s 20-65 year old cohort will have shrunk in size by a 10th by the late 2030s. Sometime between 2035 and 2040, China’s old-age dependency ratio—the proportion of people older than 65 compared with the working-age population—will surpass the U.S. equivalent, according to United Nations projections.<br />The components of growth are labor, capital, and the elusive total factor productivity. The domestic working-age population, as discussed, will be contracting. That means that unless China manages to attract many more immigrants or dramatically boost labor-force participation, it will ultimately need to maintain growth with sustained productivity improvements. And that is precisely the element that will be most difficult.</td>

      <td>Thalita Rocha Lima was visiting a crowded Covid-19 ward this month in Manaus, the biggest Brazilian city in the Amazon, when her mother-in-law Maria and other patients suddenly became agitated, breaking out in sweat and gasping for air as their fingertips turned purple.<br />“I ran over to check the equipment and that’s when I realized: There was no oxygen left,” said Ms. Rocha Lima, who rushed out into the corridor yelling, “They’re going to die.”<br />The hospital’s director informed her that the hospital had run out of oxygen and didn’t know when it would get more, she said. Her mother-in-law, a 67-year-old retired nurse, suffocated about 14 hours after the oxygen ran out, along with others in her ward, Ms. Rocha Lima said.<br />As Covid-19 cases increase sharply in much of the world, a scarcity of oxygen is forcing hospitals to ration it for patients and is driving up the coronavirus pandemic’s death toll. The problem is especially acute in the developing world, but has also hit hospitals in London and Los Angeles.<br />From Brazil to Zambia, overcrowded hospitals with too few resources are calling for emergency resupplies of oxygen. In Mexico and South Africa, people are stockpiling oxygen canisters to try to avoid overflowing Covid-19 wards, sending prices higher and making it harder for poorer families to rent tanks. In Mexico, armed bandits are stealing oxygen tanks.</td>

Mr. Buffett wrote that his company,  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,  was about to announce that it had acquired 5% of Sumitomo’s shares, part of its biggest investment in Japan.<br />“It was totally unexpected,” Mr. Hyodo said of the late-August disclosure. “He is such a distinguished investor, so it’s an honor.”<br />Mr. Buffett spent about $6 billion taking 5% stakes in five Japanese investment companies including Sumitomo, whose roots date back 430 years.<br />What has become clear since the investments is that the 90-year-old Mr. Buffett and Sumitomo have something in common beyond a venerable history.

Exports have also started to recover sharply.<br />Sany Heavy’s stock in Shanghai has hit records, and as of Monday was up 171% over the past year, giving it a market value of more than $56 billion.

Analysts and investors expect the larger homegrown machinery companies to keep growing their domestic market share, while benefiting from robust customer demand to replace old equipment. In addition, many governments globally are counting on infrastructure spending to help their economies bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic, raising expectations for future international sales.</td>

Nearly 300 SPACs are seeking deals, armed with about $90 billion in cash.<br />Latch, founded in 2014 as Latchable, is set to net around $450 million in cash from the SPAC and other investors including funds managed by  BlackRock Inc.,  Fidelity Management & Research Co. and D1 Capital Partners LP, according to an investor presentation.<br />The deal would also be a windfall for Tishman Speyer.

      <td>From Antarctica to the Arctic, the world’s ice is melting faster than ever, according to a new global satellite survey that calculated the amount of ice lost from a generation of rising temperatures.<br />Between 1994 and 2017, the Earth lost 28 trillion metric tons of ice, the survey showed. That is an amount roughly equivalent to a sheet of ice 100 meters thick covering the state of Michigan or the entire U.K.—and the meltwater from so much ice loss has raised the sea level just over an inch or so world-wide, the scientists said.<br />“It’s such a huge amount it’s hard to imagine it,” said Thomas Slater, a research fellow at the U.K.’s University of Leeds Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling and the lead author of a paper describing the new research. “Ice plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate, and losses will increase the frequency of extreme weather events such as flooding, fires, storm surges and heat waves.”<br />The paper was published Monday in the European Geophysical Union’s journal the Cryosphere.<br />Adding up the loss from glaciers, ice shelves, polar ice caps and sea ice, Dr. Slater and his colleagues determined that the rate of global melting has accelerated 65% since the 1990s.</td>

Much of the country is either struggling financially or bracing for economic impact. A Brookings Institution report projected there will be about 300,000 fewer births in 2021, an 8% drop from 2019.<br />And yet, about a year into the pandemic, many would-be parents say they’ve grown tired of waiting. Some paused fertility treatments in the spring only to realize Covid wasn’t going to disappear in a matter of months. For others, Covid was the push: the sign they needed to slow down and focus on life at home. Or the pandemic brought the silver lining of flexibility—remote work, canceled business travel—that made having a baby possible.<br />“Everything was kind of home-centered, with work and school,” says Landon Faulkner, whose wife, Kyra Faulkner, is due in February. “In some ways, it seemed even easier.”</td>

Andrew Cuomo.<br />After last year’s elections, Democrats have the two-thirds majority in both the state Assembly and Senate—enough to override a gubernatorial veto. Advocates of raising taxes are pushing rank-and-file lawmakers to flex their muscles during the budget process, which will dominate the Capitol until the next fiscal year begins April 1.<br />Mr. Cuomo proposed a $193 billion spending plan that includes $1.5 billion from raising taxes on people reporting $5 million or more in annual income. But one breath after describing the plan, he fretted about its potentially negative consequences if wealthy people leave the state. Mr. Cuomo said the plan can be avoided if the U.S. Congress approves more aid for the state.<br />Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat from Yonkers, said last week that she would push for a tax increase regardless of the amount of federal funding. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, has previously voted to approve tax increases and fruitlessly pushed to boost rates in December.<br />If neither side budges, the result could be the first bicameral veto override during Mr. Cuomo’s three terms in office.</td>

The finish was a frenzy.<br />It ended in a familiar way, albeit in unfamiliar colors. Brady is headed to his 10th Super Bowl, and his first with Tampa Bay, after the Buccaneers topped the Packers 31-26. The win makes the Buccaneers the first team in NFL history to play the Super Bowl on its home field, with the game taking place at their Raymond James Stadium on Feb. 7.<br />The Buccaneers didn’t just win. They withstood a late charge by the No. 1 seed in the NFC, which was led by the presumptive Most Valuable Player, quarterback Aaron Rodgers, at Lambeau Field. After Tampa Bay raced out to a 28-10 lead, Green Bay closed it to 28-23. Brady, at one point, threw interceptions on three consecutive possessions.<br />It was an improbable series of events that gave Tampa Bay such a commanding lead in the first place. There was an unusual mistake by Rodgers, an unexpected fourth-down call and then an unlikely play by Brady.<br />With less than a minute left in the first half, with Tampa Bay ahead just 14-10, Rodgers threw a pick—just his sixth of the season. And with under a minute to play, Brady pressed down field until his team faced fourth and 4 from the Green Bay 45-yard-line. They went for it. They got it. And on the next play, Brady threw a 39-yard touchdown to Scotty Miller.</td>

      <td>Biden should keep Trump’s last-minute executive order making regulation more accountable.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s team is understandably skeptical of “midnight” executive actions issued during President Trump’s final weeks, but one order, issued Jan. 18, is as valuable in reinforcing democratic accountability as it is constitutionally necessary. It is in Mr. Biden’s interest to strengthen it, not reflexively withdraw it.<br />The Executive Order on Ensuring Democratic Accountability in Agency Rulemaking provides that only democratically accountable agency officials may issue regulations. This means that new regulations will have to conform to the new president’s priorities and not simply those of career employees. Reversing this order could be very costly and destabilizing to Mr. Biden’s agenda, including in ways that aren’t obvious.<br />The order does more than the usual moratorium on agency rule making that new presidents impose until their own appointees can review pending rules. It would also insulate all Biden administration regulations from a potent constitutional challenge. That’s because rule making by agency employees flatly violates the Constitution’s Appointments Clause.<br />In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Supreme Court held that rule making is a significant government power that may be exercised only by officers appointed in accordance with that clause. More recent court decisions such as Edmond v. United States (1997) support the conclusion that only principal agency officers (like department heads and assistant secretaries confirmed by the Senate) may issue regulations that have the force of law and can’t be amended without another rule-making procedure.<br />Compliance with constitutional rule-making requirements has been inconsistent, undermining both democratic accountability and—because improperly issued rules are subject to legal challenge—agencies’ own agendas. This is no small problem. We broke the news on these pages nearly three years ago that hundreds of Food and Drug Administration rules were illegal because they had been issued by career staff. Subsequent Pacific Legal Foundation research on the Health and Human Services Department’s rule-making practices from 2001 to 2017 revealed that 1,860 FDA final rules (98% of the total) had been issued illegally and that other HHS agencies had similar problems.</td>

      <td>Both left and right want to regulate social media, but their ‘fixes’ would break the web.</td>
      <td>Ding dong, he’s gone, but Donald Trump’s bans from  Facebook ,   Twitter ,  Google, Reddit, Snapchat, Grindr (wait, what?),  Pinterest ,  TikTok and others mostly persist. Don’t bans on Mr. Trump and others violate the First Amendment? Actually, it’s private companies invoking their own First Amendment right to bar things they don’t like. But even Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called it “a failure.” That’s also true of Parler’s decapitation. Never mind that these actions seem partisan and hypocritical; the bans will continue until morale improves. Democrats may cheer but the precedent is scary—soon they’ll be silencing their own. Vive la guillotine electronique.<br />Expect the siren calls for regulation to become deafening—mostly focused on “updating” Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, the provision that limits social-media companies’ liability for things users say. A year ago Joe Biden said it should be “revoked, immediately.” The law states that except for illegal materials like child pornography, companies can host everything and employ their own community standards to take down what they consider offensive.<br />This mess was all predicted by a comic strip (really!) in 2004, when only Harvard dorm residents knew about TheFacebook—and Twitter was two years away. John “Gabe” Gabriel—the alter ego of one of the creators of Penny Arcade, a web comic—came up with the Greater Internet [Jerkwad] Theory (obscenity deleted). The theory is spelled out on a green chalkboard: “Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total [Jerkwad]” while interpreters note that “normal, well-adjusted people may display psychopathic or antisocial behaviors when given both anonymity and a captive audience on the Internet.” It’s no longer a theory, is it?<br />In our new slushy, snowflake-soaked society, some folks are offended by just about anything, and are quick to deploy torches and pitchforks to silence and cancel anything not currently considered politically correct. It’s worth reiterating: social media and all its benefits (ask small businesses) wouldn’t exist without Section 230. Instead of hiring hundreds of thousands of coders, Facebook and Twitter would instead be giant law firms forever fighting lawsuits.<br />Still, Facebook ran ads all fall practically begging for regulation. But any attempt to “fix” Section 230 would surely kill it. Legislation would be a bicameral camel—a horse designed by committee—trying to define community standards, hate speech, what “incites” riots, what constitutes “systemic” racism and on and on, with the inevitable loopholes for certain politicians and favored groups.</td>

      <td>Federalism is again proving its value in getting shots in arms.</td>
      <td>President Biden is vowing to meet a goal of 100 million Covid-19 vaccines in 100 days, and if anything that is too modest given the pace of production. One way to do better is to heed lessons in flexibility from the states with the most successful vaccine rollouts.<br />Some six weeks after the first shipments, the U.S. has administered some 53% of distributed vaccines. The gap continues to grow between states that are getting shots into arms, and those arguing over who gets what and when. North Dakota had administered some 84% of its supply as of Jan. 23, and West Virginia about 83%—far better than states like California (45%) or Alabama (47%). Federalism is showing what works—and what doesn’t.<br />The federal government’s main role is the production and distribution of vaccine doses, and the Biden Administration is fortunate to inherit Operation Warp Speed. Mr. Biden says he’ll trigger the Defense Production Act to expand vaccine production, albeit without details on how he’d build on the existing plan.<br />One step forward would be to approve the  AstraZeneca  vaccine on an emergency basis, as the U.K. did last month. It may not prove as effective as the mRNA shots from  Pfizer  and Moderna, but it would add to supply, is easier to transport, and would be a particularly good candidate for younger, healthy Americans.<br />The risk is that Team Biden tries to micromanage state administration of the vaccine, especially now that the media, Democrats and some public-health officials are blaming slow state rollouts on a “vacuum” of federal leadership. But vaccine administration was always intended to be state-led, and too many jurisdictions squandered the ample time they had for preparation.</td>

      <td>Presidents deserve the advisers they choose absent significant cause. In the case of Joe Biden’s choice to lead the U.S. Agency for International Development, Samantha Power, one question to ask is how honest she was about her role in snooping on Michael Flynn.<br />In late 2016 Mr. Flynn was the incoming national security adviser for Donald Trump. Mr. Flynn’s conversation with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. was recorded by U.S. spooks, and his name leaked after being “unmasked” by several figures in the Obama Administration. Who did the leaking—a felony—has never been solved. But the leak fed the media fires over Mr. Trump’s alleged collusion with the Russians, and Mr. Flynn was unjustly prosecuted.<br />At the time Ms. Power was U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. She was a political appointee and not an intelligence professional. Yet Congress looked into it and found that over her last year in office Ms. Power had unmasked nearly 300 people, without any concrete explanation of why she needed this information.<br />During an Oct. 13, 2017, appearance before the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) asked her directly about the unmasking and leaking of Gen. Flynn’s name. “I did want to get you on the record,” he told her. Ms. Power categorically denied she leaked his name—or any classified information.<br />She was fuzzier about unmasking. “I have no recollection of making a request related to General Flynn,” she replied. Then again, maybe she had reason to be fuzzy.</td>

      <td>The state party reveals the divisions that could doom the GOP for years.</td>
      <td>Republicans lost Arizona in the November presidential race for the first time since 1996, and they have lost three U.S. Senate races in a row. How to respond? Naturally, Arizona’s Republican Party decided on the weekend to censure three of its most prominent . . . fellow Republicans.<br />The state party’s committee members, led by chairwoman Kelli Ward, passed resolutions rebuking Cindy McCain, the widow of former Sen. John McCain; former Sen. Jeff Flake; and even current Gov. Doug Ducey. The first two offended the members by endorsing Joe Biden over Donald Trump for President. Mr. Ducey’s offense is that he introduced pandemic lockdowns—though they were relatively modest compared to those in much of the country.<br />The resolutions have little practical effect, but they symbolize the party divisions that could doom the GOP to minority status nationwide for years. Ms. Ward, who has run twice for Senate and lost, was endorsed for party chair this past week by Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, now decamped to Mar-a-Lago, is contemplating revenge against everyone in the GOP he blames for his defeat.<br />Sensible parties that lose elections try to reunite in opposition even while they debate policy differences and examine why they lost. They don’t excommunicate people who could help rebuild a majority. Mr. Flake and Ms. McCain found Mr. Trump’s behavior as President unacceptable, but they were hardly alone. Mr. Trump didn’t lose because Republicans betrayed him. He lost because he alienated too many voters in Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona who liked his policies but disliked his tumultuous leadership.<br />The attack on Mr. Ducey is simply bizarre. The Governor has a strong conservative record and will finish his second term in 2022. Senate Republicans have been hoping to recruit him to run against newly elected Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who must run again in 2022 because he is filling former Sen. McCain’s uncompleted term.</td>

      <td>Some blamed the mayhem on the pandemic, but persistent cop-bashing emboldened criminals.</td>
      <td>The year 2020 likely saw the largest percentage increase in homicides in American history. Murder was up nearly 37% in a sample of 57 large and medium-size cities. Based on preliminary estimates, at least 2,000 more Americans, most of them black, were killed in 2020 than in 2019. Mainstream media and many politicians claim the pandemic caused this bloodbath, but the chronology doesn’t support that assertion. And now the criminal-justice policies supported by President Biden promise to exacerbate the current crime wave, while ignoring its actual causes.<br />The local murder increases in 2020 were startling: 95% in Milwaukee, 78% in Louisville, Ky., 74% in Seattle, 72% in Minneapolis, 62% in New Orleans, and 58% in Atlanta, according to data compiled by crime analyst Jeff Asher. Dozens of children, overwhelmingly black, were killed in drive-by shootings. They were slain in their beds, living rooms and strollers. They were struck down at barbecues, in their yards, in malls, in their parents’ cars, and at birthday parties. Fifty-five children were killed in Chicago in 2020, 17 in St. Louis, and 11 in Philadelphia. In South Los Angeles alone, 40 children were shot, some non-lethally, through September.<br />Why this mayhem? The St. Louis Post-Dispatch expresses the conventional wisdom: because of the “economic, civic and interpersonal stress” from the coronavirus pandemic. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot blamed pandemic-related “frustration, anger . . . trauma and mental health challenges.” But crime fell during the first months of the pandemic shutdowns, both in the U.S. and globally. Only at the end of May did that trend reverse itself, and only in the U.S., thanks to a surge in drive-by shootings.<br />Eighteen people were murdered in Chicago on May 31—the city’s most violent day in six decades, according to University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell. Other American cities saw similar spikes in mayhem, all tied to the street violence unleashed by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. The political and media response to Floyd’s death amplified the existing narrative that policing was lethally racist. The ensuing riots received little condemnation from Democratic leaders and a weak response from the criminal-justice system.<br />Cops now face a poisonous environment. Since the summer, they have been shot in the head, firebombed and assaulted with lethal projectiles. An officer providing first aid at a crime scene may be met with a hail of rocks and bottles. Resistance is now the norm. Officers believe they face a political and legal environment that is eager to sacrifice them in the name of racial justice.</td>

      <td>‘The famous and notorious alike are given the chance, with America tuned in, to defend a life’s reputation.’</td>
      <td>From Tunku Varadarajan’s review of CNN’s “Larry King Live” in the Journal, Oct. 25, 2002. King died Saturday at 87:<br /><br />It would be easy to accuse Mr. King of flacking for every scoundrel who provides the crowd-pleasing humiliation that keeps ratings healthy—or for every worthy who’s written a book and wants to clear his throat on air about it. Some might believe that his program is morally questionable, but entertaining. . . . In fact, it’s often quite the opposite: hugely dull, but morally sound, in that it offers a worthy democratic service, giving the popularly reviled members of society—shoplifting actresses, allegedly homicidal pols and even nonwealthy, nonpowerful criminal suspects—an opportunity to face their accusers, as it were, with equal viewership. . . .<br />True, the very wealthy and privileged are held to a higher standard of social comportment, as they should be. But often Mr. King—by serving as a blank slate, like a good psychiatrist—gives them a valuable opportunity to make a full confession with their own ill-chosen words. And sometimes the benefit of a “Larry King Live” appearance is ambiguous (as with the parents of JonBenet Ramsey, or Susan McDougal). The important point is that the famous and notorious alike are given the chance, with America tuned in, to defend a life’s reputation, or to lessen the damage of their 15 minutes of fame.<br />Can this be such a bad thing?</td>

      <td>Step one is to increase the number of H-2 guest-worker visas for Central Americans.</td>
      <td>Some 8,000 Honduran asylum seekers tried to get up a welcoming party of sorts for President Joe Biden this month. Their effort to reach the U.S. southern border in at least two caravans was repelled thanks to agreements that President Trump made with Mexico and Guatemala to use force to intercept illegal aliens. But Central America remains a simmering cauldron of would-be migrants desperate to work in the U.S.<br />Mr. Biden now has to come up with his own strategy. More resources at the border to process applicants could help. But without new incentives for migrants to follow the law, the U.S. will remain heavily dependent on the militarization of immigration policy in Guatemala and Mexico to contain the inevitable flows of illegal aliens.<br />The Hondurans seem to have concluded logically that with the Democrats in power again, Trump-era restrictions on asylum were sure to be lifted. Yet on Jan. 17 NBC News reported that a senior Biden transition official said its message to the migrants was that this “is not the time to make the journey.” That same official also said they “need to understand they’re not going to be able to come into the United States immediately.”<br />Nice words of warning did nothing to discourage the migrants who had set out on Jan. 15. By Jan. 18 they were engaged in violent confrontations with Guatemalan National Guard and national police. Mothers in tears sat on the ground holding their children while young men blocked roads, threw stones, and tried to push their way past law enforcement.<br />Reports from the front say that thousands were turned back. My sources say the rest have broken into smaller groups that continue to move north. The White House said over the weekend that Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador—known as AMLO—has agreed to keeping working to “curb the flow” of illegal aliens from Central America in Mexico. If they make it to the U.S. border the Biden administration has warned that processing priority will go to those already waiting in the asylum queue.</td>

      <td>A sit-down strike at General Motors outraged Alfred Sloan, the company’s president. As days turned into weeks, he decided to make a deal.</td>
      <td>Here’s a remarkable fact: In 1980 the median income for young workers in Flint, Mich., was higher than in San Francisco. Flint was a company town, and as Edward McClelland says in “Midnight in Vehicle City”: “There was never a better time to work for General Motors.”<br />Who could disagree? Employees at GM and the other big auto makers had cost-of-living adjustments, two cars in their driveways, lifetime health care and a pension. In Michigan, they had summer cottages and deer hunting trips Up North.<br />It all arose, so Mr. McClelland posits, from a 1936-37 sit-down strike when auto workers in Flint struck GM and demanded bargaining recognition for the fledgling United Auto Workers of America.<br />The strike lasted 44 days. It was violent on both sides but turned into a standoff in which the UAW refused to call an end until it won exclusive bargaining rights, and GM refused to talk until the workers left its premises.<br />Mr. McClelland tells the story of those tension-filled days, when strikers armed with car-door hinges and homemade blackjacks fended off tear gas and the Flint police. According to the book’s subtitle, Flint was “the strike that created the middle class.” The author, a journalist and historian from Lansing, barely bothers to substantiate that claim, but his chronicle of the strike is compelling.</td>

But, they said, it doesn’t mean the contagion can’t be contained.<br />“We’re living in a world where coronavirus is so prevalent and rapidly mutating that there are going to be new variants that pop up,” Anthony Harnden, a physician who advises the U.K. government, told Sky News. “We may well be in a situation where we end up having to have an annual coronavirus vaccine” to cope with emerging strains.<br />As the new variant in the U.K. has spread across the country, hospitals have been under more strain than they were in the first wave of the pandemic in the spring, and the national Covid-19 death toll is expected to surpass 100,000 in coming days. But in the week ended Sunday, new daily cases were down 22% from the previous seven days.<br />Matt Hancock, the U.K.’s health secretary, said that was because of national restrictions in place since the start of the year.

      <td>China overtook the U.S. as the world’s top destination for new foreign direct investment last year, as the Covid-19 pandemic amplifies an eastward shift in the center of gravity of the global economy.<br />New investments by overseas businesses into the U.S., which for decades held the No. 1 spot, fell 49% in 2020, according to U.N. figures released Sunday, as the country struggled to curb the spread of the new coronavirus and economic output slumped.<br />China, long ranked No. 2, saw direct investments by foreign companies climb 4%, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said. Beijing used strict lockdowns to largely contain Covid-19 after the disease first emerged in a central Chinese city, and China’s gross domestic product grew even as most other major economies contracted last year.<br />The 2020 investment numbers underline China’s move toward the center of a global economy long dominated by the U.S.—a shift accelerated during the pandemic as China has cemented its position as the world’s factory floor and expanded its share of global trade.<br />While China attracted more new inflows last year, the total stock of foreign investment in the U.S. remains much larger, reflecting the decades it has spent as the most attractive location for foreign businesses looking to expand outside their home markets.</td>

      <td><br />WASHINGTON—President Biden’s push for a sweeping coronavirus-relief bill is emerging as the first test of his pledge to bring a return of bipartisanship to Washington, a promise made more difficult as partisan lines are hardening in the Senate over the impeachment fate of his predecessor.<br />On Sunday, Brian Deese, head of the White House’s National Economic Council, is scheduled to confer with a group of lawmakers previously involved in bipartisan negotiations to discuss President Biden’s coronavirus-relief bill.<br />Mr. Biden earlier this month rolled out a $1.9 trillion plan that would provide an additional $1,400 in direct payments per person, topping off the $600 checks approved in December. The plan also includes money for rental assistance and food stamps, to extend federal unemployment assistance through September and increase the weekly federal subsidy to $400 from $300.<br />Some Republicans have raised concerns about the proposal’s price tag and the inclusion of unrelated, longtime Democratic policy proposals such as an increase in the minimum wage.</td>

China’s industrial sector led its economic recovery from Covid-19 shocks and was buoyed by global demand for protective gear and work-from-home electronic devices.<br />U.S. durable goods orders likely rose for the eighth consecutive month in December. The manufacturing sector has been resilient through much of the pandemic as businesses make modest investments and consumers shift spending away from services and toward goods.<br />The Federal Reserve is expected to leave policy unchanged. Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to underscore the central bank’s commitment to supporting the economy with low rates and continued bond purchases for the foreseeable future.</td>
