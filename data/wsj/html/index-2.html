      <td>The Senate minority leader’s remarks came during a Fox News interview</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would support Donald Trump if GOP voters select him as the party’s nominee in 2024, the latest remarks from the Kentucky Republican on his stance toward the former president’s future in the party.<br />Asked Thursday on Fox News whether he would support Mr. Trump if that was whom Republican voters chose in 2024, Mr. McConnell said “the nominee of the party? Absolutely.” He also said “there’s a lot to happen between now and ‘24,” with at least four Republican senators he thinks are planning to run for president in addition to governors and others. Mr. McConnell didn’t identify the four members. GOP Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Marco Rubio of Florida are viewed by strategists, donors and lawmakers as potential candidates.<br />Mr. McConnell’s comments marked a contrast to the approach taken by Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.), the head of the House Republican Conference, towards Mr. Trump. Ms. Cheney voted to impeach Mr. Trump on a charge that he incited the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, stood by her decision, and earlier this week said “I don’t believe that he should be playing a role in the future of the party or the country.”<br />Mr. McConnell said earlier this month on the Senate floor, after the former president was acquitted, that Mr. Trump’s actions before the Jan. 6 riots were a dereliction of duty. He followed up with an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, saying “there is no question former President Trump bears moral responsibility.”<br />Mr. McConnell also was silent recently when some Republican senators criticized him for his harsh tone toward Mr. Trump. Similarly, he declined to comment after Mr. Trump called him a “dour, sullen and unsmiling political hack” and said, “The Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political ‘leaders’ like Sen. Mitch McConnell at its helm.”</td>

      <td><br />Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry<br />Friday, AppleTV+<br />If there’s one takeaway from stories about pop superstars, it’s that, usually, fame messes people up. Under intense pressure from fans—and record labels—child stars from Britney Spears to Justin Bieber have appeared to self-destruct. The question that hangs over “Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry” (Friday, AppleTV+) is whether this wildly successful teenager will be any different. And it’s a particularly tricky case because Ms. Eilish has staked her reputation on her immense emotional vulnerability.<br />She first rose to prominence when the song “Ocean Eyes” (2015), recorded when she was just 13 years old, went viral. After that she released an EP, “Don’t Smile at Me” (2017), and went on tour in North America and Europe. The bulk of the film takes place between her 17th and 18th birthdays. When we meet her, Ms. Eilish is writing her first full-length album, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” (2019). By the end of the documentary, she will have won five Grammy Awards, including a sweep of the four major categories.</td>

It wasn’t immediately known how many casualties resulted from the strike, but the official said casualties likely were minimal.<br />The airstrike was the first known instance in which the Biden administration had approved the use of military force against an adversary since taking office last month.<br />A series of rocket attacks on Feb. 15 in Erbil, Iraq, killed a Filipino national who was a U.S. contractor, while injuring a U.S. service member and other contractors. Since then, the Biden administration has been deliberating a response.<br />President Biden mentioned the rocket attacks in a phone call Tuesday with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi. A White House statement afterward said the two agreed and “that those responsible for such attacks must be held fully to account.”</td>

      <td>The Federal Reserve said an outage of its key financial services on Wednesday was caused by a maintenance mistake and it is taking steps to prevent a recurrence.<br />“The incident was caused by an operational error involving an automated data center maintenance process that was inadvertently triggered during business hours,” a Fed spokeswoman said. Such tasks are normally performed after-hours, she said, adding, “This was human error.”<br />The disruption shut down all the Fed’s financial services Wednesday for about four hours, halting electronic systems used by banks, businesses and government agencies to move money. While the problem was resolved after the Fed extended its business hours to clear a backlog of payments, it prompted banks to initiate emergency protocols and raised questions about the resilience of critical financial plumbing.<br />“When things like this happen it undermines public confidence,” said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economics professor who served at the Fed from 1992 to 2012.<br />One person familiar with the Fed’s systems said they rely on a geographically dispersed network of data centers, servers and mainframes. Problems that occur in a key location at the wrong time can require the systems to be rebooted, which is what the Fed did Wednesday.</td>

      <td>Imagine if a pair of Donald Trump’s allies in Congress had sent a letter to cable company CEOs in 2017 blasting CNN and other progressive media outlets and asking why their content is still broadcast. Then imagine that a GOP-run committee in Congress staged a hearing on the societal menace of fake news and the need for government and business to rein in the hostile press.<br />The media would have treated that as a five-alarm political fire, an existential threat to a free press, the First Amendment and political norms, and a step toward authoritarian rule. “Democracy dies in darkness,” and all that. Yet that’s exactly what Democrats in Congress did this week, targeting conservative media outlets, but the media reaction has been silence or approval.<br />On Monday Democrats Anna Eshoo and Jerry McNerney sent letters pressing 12 cable and tech CEOs to drop contracts with right-of-center media outlets including Fox News. Two days later the Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing about “disinformation and extremism” in conservative media. The only notable extremism on display was the majority party’s appetite for regulating and policing the free press.<br />Rep. Mike Doyle, chair of the subcommittee on communications and technology, declared in opening remarks that “it is the responsibility of this subcommittee to hold these institutions”—meaning press outlets he doesn’t like—“to a higher standard.” He said later that “more free speech just isn’t winning the day over the kind of speech we are concerned about.”<br />Democrats chose witnesses to lay the rhetorical foundation for press restrictions. One was Kristin Urquiza, whose father died of coronavirus and who spoke at the Democratic convention against Donald Trump. She said “the media didn’t pull the trigger” in her father’s death, “but they drove the getaway car,” because he watched and listened to news that downplayed the virus.</td>

      <td>The 10-year Treasury resumes its rise and stocks hit the skids.</td>
      <td>So much for Jerome Powell’s reassurances. Only a day after the Federal Reserve Chairman’s two-day, nothing-to-worry-about tour of Capitol Hill, financial markets suddenly found plenty to worry about on Thursday. Stocks fell sharply as the 10-year Treasury note yield had its largest one-day advance since November to its highest level in a year.<br />The 10-year Treasury is often called the world’s most important price, and it has moved up by some 58 basis points in about two months to a yield of 1.525%. The rapid move has caught markets by surprise. The Fed was supposed to be keeping long bond prices down for months if not years to come through its quantitative-easing bond purchases.<br />What does it mean? The sanguine interpretation is that bonds are merely signaling that markets are finally seeing the “sunlit uplands” of post-pandemic optimism, as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likes to put it. Growth means more risk-taking, and rising rates are often associated with economic recoveries and faster growth. By any normal historical standard, a 10-year yield of 1.525% is hardly something to be alarmed about.<br />There’s no doubt the economy is poised for a growth boom in 2021 as the pandemic eases. Pent-up savings by consumers and pent-up animal spirits are bound to be unleashed as the vaccine rollouts spread and lockdowns end.<br />That was certainly Mr. Powell’s view on Tuesday as he responded to Sen. Pat Toomey’s question about rising interest rates: “if you look at what the market is looking at, what markets are looking at, it’s a reopening economy with vaccination, it’s fiscal stimulus, it’s highly accommodated monetary policy, it’s savings accumulated on people’s balance sheets. It’s the expectations of much higher corporate profits, which matters a lot for the equity markets.”</td>

      <td>AT&T Inc. agreed to sell a stake in its pay-TV unit to private-equity firm TPG and carve out the struggling business, pulling the telecom giant back from a costly wager on entertainment.<br />The transaction would move the DirecTV and AT&T TV services in the U.S. into a new entity that will be jointly run by the new partners. AT&T will retain a 70% stake in the business. TPG will pay $1.8 billion in cash for a 30% stake.<br />The deal values the new company at $16.25 billion with about $6.4 billion of debt. That is well below the $49 billion—about $66 billion including debt—that the Dallas company paid to buy international satellite operator DirecTV in 2015. AT&T recently struck $15.5 billion off the value of the unit, reflecting the service’s dimmer prospects.<br />AT&T said it would get about $7.8 billion in cash from the transaction to help pay down debts. Those proceeds include $5.8 billion that the new company will borrow from banks and pay back to AT&T.<br />AT&T will be able to stop including results from its U.S. video operations in its consolidated financial reports. The telecom company also agreed to cover up to $2.5 billion in losses tied to DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket package.</td>

      <td>The songwriter and activist known as Joe Hill coined the phrase in a parody of a Salvation Army hymn</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />When President Biden signed executive orders last month addressing climate change, he insisted that his plan to wean the country from its dependence on fossil fuels would also create “new, good-paying jobs” for those working in affected industries. “These aren’t pie-in-the-sky dreams,” Mr. Biden said.<br />Critics of the administration’s policies were quick to use the same term to disagree. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, complained that “pie-in-the-sky government mandates and directives” would hurt energy security. This week, Politico quotedTerry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, as saying, “It’s pie in the sky bulls— about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.”<br />All of this “pie in the sky” talk has its origins in a satirical protest song written by a labor activist more than a century ago. The expression was coined by a Swedish immigrant to the U.S., born Joel Hägglund. He changed his name to Joe Hillstrom while working as an itinerant laborer and changed it again to Joe Hill as he became a popular songwriter for the labor movement.<br />Around 1910, Hill was working on the docks in San Pedro, Calif., and joined up with the Industrial Workers of the World, or IWW, a radical labor union whose members were dubbed the Wobblies. At the time, the IWW was organizing migrant workers who gathered on the “skid rows” of Western cities when they were between jobs. In those cities, the Wobblies often clashed with the Salvation Army, whose preachers proselytized from street-corner missions.</td>

      <td>The Democratic spending bill would put many out of business.</td>
      <td>Colleges for years have justified charging exorbitant tuition by offering what they claim is an immersive education. But many closed their campuses during the pandemic and didn’t discount tuition. Now Democrats plan to shower them with more money while punishing vocational schools.<br />Congress allocated colleges $14 billion from the Cares Act and $23 billion in the December relief bill on top of the $125 billion in federal student aid they soak up annually. The new $1.9 trillion bill would hand them another $40 billion regardless of whether they open or need the money. The December bill at least reduced aid to colleges with enormous endowments.<br />Democrats have also cut the share of money going to proprietary schools to 1% from 3%. For-profits will have to distribute 100% of their federal relief to students, which is fair enough. But nonprofit and public colleges only have to spend 50% on student aid. They can spend the rest on diversity coordinators and higher salaries for tenured professors.<br />The distinction between nonprofit and for-profit colleges is becoming increasingly tenuous. Four years of tuition at many nonprofits now costs more than a new home. Yet colleges aren’t accountable for student outcomes, and many graduate with enormous debt and degrees that don’t help them get high-paying jobs.<br />At least the pandemic forced some to tighten their belts. Consider the University of Southern California, which is trading its president’s colonial seven-acre estate for $24.5 million for a more modest $8.6 million mansion. Tough living. For-profit enrollment has shrunk by half over the last decade due to the Obama regulatory assault and improved job market. Several large chains have closed, and many surviving schools are small businesses that offer training in fields like welding, cybersecurity and nursing—skills in high demand.</td>

The pandemic’s blow to the food-service industry hurt Beyond’s business, which had been heavily propelled by restaurants in recent years, and prompted the company to focus more on supermarket sales.<br />Beyond reported Thursday a $25.1 million loss for 2020’s fourth quarter, as restaurant orders remained sluggish.<br />“They are the biggest deals you could possibly put together in food,” said Ethan Brown, Beyond Meat’s chief executive and founder, of the new agreements with McDonald’s and Yum.</td>

      <td>‘The pandemic changed everything,’ we say. But we have yet to absorb fully everything that means.</td>
      <td>New York<br />You can know something yet not fully absorb it. I think that’s happened with the pandemic. It is a year now since it settled into America and brought such damage—half a million dead, a nation in lockdown, a catastrophe for public schools. We keep saying “the pandemic changed everything,” but I’m not sure we understand the words we’re saying.<br />It will be decades before we fully appreciate what the pandemic did to us, and I mean our entire society—our culture, power structures, social ways, economic realities. We’ll see it more clearly when we look back from 2030 and 2040. A lot is not fully calculable now, and some problems haven’t presented themselves. One is going to be the profound psychological impact on some young people—how anxious and frightened this era will leave them, even how doom-laden. Kids 5 and 7 years old were trapped in a house surrounded by screens, and the screens said “germs” and “death” and “invisible carriers.” The pictures were of sobbing people on gurneys. We should be especially concerned about kids who are neglected and have no calm in the house, because they were left most exposed to the endless vibrations of the adults on the screens, and had no schools or teachers to help them.<br />But we’re in a transformational time. Some things that might have changed inch by inch over the next few decades were transformed in one large, incredible, 12-month shift. So many institutions will have to be nimble and farsighted now or they won’t survive. They’re going to have to be creative and generous and leave old intransigences behind. To lead in times like this will require the eyes of an artist who sees the broad shape of things, not an analyst who sees data points.<br />Look at the cities. I’m not sure we see the implications of what has happened there. In New York we are witnessing, for the first time in a century and a half, the collapse of the commuter model. You had to be in the magic metropolis if you were going to be in the top of your profession—finance, theater, law, whatever. Many couldn’t afford to live in the city because it’s where the top, moneyed people were, so they lived in the near-outside—New Jersey, Long Island, Connecticut. That is what my people did when they came to America a century ago, settling in Brooklyn and commuting to work as cooks and maids in the great houses of Manhattan.</td>

He has told contacts he used local connections to obtain the vaccines, some of these people said, and he has remained in the U.A.E. and is due to receive his second dose in coming weeks, they said.<br />Mr. Machin didn’t comment when reached by phone and email. A spokesman for CPPIB and Mr. Machin said that he had “deeply personal” reasons for traveling to the U.A.E. “I can assure you that zero influence was applied or sought to be applied” in order for him to obtain the vaccine, the spokesman said.<br />The CPPIB is a crown corporation, meaning it is governed independently from the federal government but is the steward of pension obligations that are government mandated. It reports to a board of directors, who are selected by Canada’s minister of finance.<br />A spokeswoman for Canada’s ministry of finance said that “while the CPPIB is an independent organization, this is very troubling. The federal government has been clear with Canadians that now is not the time to travel abroad. We were not made aware of this travel.”</td>

      <td>Seeking to undermine Trump, Democrats, media and scientists made false and alarming claims.</td>
      <td>President Biden has proposed an “unprecedented” information campaign to persuade people to get Covid-19 vaccinations. Why, when a pandemic has killed 500,000 Americans, does the public need to be convinced? In part because Mr. Biden and his allies spent 2020 stoking fear for political reasons.<br />The Biden campaign and scientists allied with it impugned the Food and Drug Administration’s independence and integrity. Kamala Harris maligned President Trump’s claims about the speed of vaccine development and questioned its safety and effectiveness. New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo cast doubt on FDA evaluations of Covid-19 vaccines and said states should conduct their own reviews. An Aug. 27 letter from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asking governors for help setting up vaccine distribution elicited a statement from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer questioning the safety of the vaccines in development. Media “fact checkers” said rapid vaccine development would take a “miracle.”<br />Between April 1-14 and Nov. 25-Dec. 8 the share of Americans who told pollsters they were likely to consent to vaccination declined from 74% to 56%, even though  Pfizer  and Moderna released strong vaccine safety and effectiveness results prior to the second survey. The decline occurred in both sexes and all age groups, education levels and racial groups. Many medical workers, including nursing-home staff, are also hesitant to be vaccinated.<br />Medical authorities were complicit in stoking these fears. Although June FDA guidance confirmed the agency wouldn’t “cut corners” and that expedited development would proceed “without sacrificing our standards for quality, safety, and efficacy,” a Sept. 10 editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association claimed that “some” were concerned that political appointees would “insist” on authorizing a vaccine “over the recommendation of FDA career scientists.” The concerned “some” were never named, and no citation was given.<br />The editorial claimed FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn had “indicated that the FDA is willing to use an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for vaccines before phase 3 trials are complete.” It cited an Aug. 7 JAMA article by three FDA officials including Dr. Hahn and Peter Marks, head of the FDA center responsible for vaccine reviews. In fact, that article, titled “Unwavering Regulatory Safeguards for COVID-19 Vaccines,” didn’t signal a loosening of standards. It committed to issuing an EUA only once clinical trials demonstrate safety and effectiveness, which FDA guidance indicated could be based on final analysis of a phase 3 trial or on interim analysis of such a trial that met specified success and safety criteria and after public discussion at the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.</td>

      <td>As many as eight million by our estimate, in part by gutting many of Clinton’s successful welfare reforms.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-relief package is being sold as an effort to “get America back to work.” It will do the opposite. We estimate that between five million and eight million fewer Americans will be employed over the next six months if the bill passes.<br />The bill would create one of the largest expansions in government welfare benefits since the birth of the modern welfare state. In combination with December’s $900 billion package, the new bill would expand the safety net to include six months of weekly $400 bonus unemployment benefits on top of the normal weekly benefits, a $3,000-a-child tax credit, an expansion of food stamps and rental assistance, $2,000-a-person checks, and expanded health benefits.<br />The Biden plan is welfare reform in reverse. It would repeal many of the successful work requirements dating to the Clinton era, and it contains only minimal requirements in exchange for its cash payments and other benefits.<br />There’s more. Unlike wages and salaries earned from work, many of these benefits are tax-free. So the after-tax equivalent of receiving a paycheck versus government benefits is even more tilted against working. There is no 7.65% payroll tax deducted from an unemployment check, as there would be on a paycheck. Unemployment benefits are subject to income taxes in most of the country, but six states don’t count them as taxable income.<br />In Kansas, a family of four with two unemployed adults who had earned U.S. median wages could get paid, including the Biden add-on package, the after-tax equivalent of more than $135,000 on an annual basis without working an hour. In Massachusetts, where state unemployment benefits are the highest in the nation, the figure is $170,000. This doesn’t include any housing or rental assistance the family may also receive. The Biden package of benefits would exceed the wages and salaries of at least 85% of households.</td>

      <td>Ben Hogan won 64 tours after doctors said he might never walk.</td>
      <td>It’s a February morning, and the man with the most famous name in professional golf is behind the wheel of his car. He has long been regarded not only for his prodigious talent, but also for a distant, obsessed personality that has made many of his fellow pros say they don’t really know him.<br />Before the morning is over, a gruesome automobile accident will have shattered his body and caused his fans to wonder not only if he will ever play golf again, but if he will ever walk again.<br />It was 1949, the golfer was Ben Hogan, and what happened next remains one of the most implausible and thrilling stories in sports history. When Tiger Woods crashed his car this week, the news flashed instantly from screen to screen; Hogan’s accident took place just before the television era, never mind the internet, and word traveled more slowly. But headline writers assumed they were describing the end of a brilliant career.<br />Hogan and his wife, Valerie, were returning from the Phoenix Open. At 36, he was the holder of a U.S. Open title and two PGA championships. His future seemed limitless. En route to their home in Fort Worth, Texas, they were on a narrow highway when a Greyhound bus coming from the other direction tried to pass a truck.<br />Hogan, knowing the bus was about to strike his car head-on, threw his body over his wife’s in the passenger seat to protect her. She would later say, “It’s a good thing he did, because the engine of our car was tossed back into the seat and the steering column was shoved through the driver’s seat and into the back.” Hogan’s injuries were devastating: his pelvis broken in two places, his collarbone shattered, his ankle fractured, his ribs chipped and blood clots forming. He would not leave the hospital for 59 days.</td>

      <td>Like others in the black community, I was hesitant. Then I did my research.</td>
      <td>Like many African-Americans, I had a great deal of trepidation about the Covid-19 vaccine. But last week my wife and I completed our course of vaccinations. My experience as a pastor and leader in the black community led me to believe it was the right thing to do.<br />Opinion polls show that African-Americans have the greatest hesitation of any group about the Covid vaccine. These reservations are rooted in centuries of mistreatment as well as illegal and unethical experimentation by the nation’s medical establishment. In the 19th century James Marion Sims, the man regarded as the father of modern gynecology, conducted scores of experiments on enslaved women without anesthesia. The notorious “Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male” continued into the 1970s.<br />Outcomes in health care also aren’t encouraging. African-Americans have twice the infant-mortality rate of whites. African-American women are more than three times as likely as their white counterparts to die from pregnancy-related causes. The breast-cancer mortality rate is 42% higher for black women than for white women. My father died when I was only 16, thanks largely to misdiagnosed and mistreated hypertension. Disturbing news accounts of disparate treatment in American health-care facilities have emerged during the pandemic.<br />Unfounded rumors about an attempt to use the vaccine to wipe out the black community have gained currency among my fellow African-Americans. I understand the general mistrust, but the painful truth is that blacks need the vaccine more than anyone. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says we are nearly three times as likely as whites to die from Covid.<br />As a minister, I have witnessed these deaths personally. I have buried many friends and church members. At the peak of the pandemic, I regularly received reports of two or three deaths each day. I have struggled to console and counsel their survivors, most of whom couldn’t be in the same room with their loved ones as they took their last breaths. Over the weekend, I lost an old friend and colleague to the virus. But I believe that the God who brought us through slavery, Jim Crow, the Spanish flu and lynchings can steer us through this crisis as well.</td>

      <td>The Lindbergh baby was only the most high-proﬁle victim of an ‘epidemic’ of abductions in 1930s America.</td>
      <td>Decades before actor Kevin McCarthy had his big-screen encounter with the pod people of Santa Mira, Calif., America suffered from an invasion of real-life body snatchers.<br />Through the Jazz Age and the Depression, mobsters and copycat amateurs captured rich and prominent people or their children and held them for ransom. Most of the victims were freed unharmed, often for a million dollars or more in today’s money. But in the most notorious case—the kidnapping of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh’s 20-month-old Charlie from their home in New Jersey—the baby was long dead during the endless negotiations for his release.<br />That case prompted the passage of the “Lindbergh Law”—the Federal Kidnapping Act of 1932—enabling the U.S. government to get involved and giving J. Edgar Hoover, the head of the FBI, a boost in his insatiable quest for fame. Even so, the epidemic of kidnapping, as the papers called it, stubbornly persisted through the 1930s and into our times. Frank Sinatra’s 19-year-old son Frank Jr. was grabbed at Harrah’s Lake Tahoe in 1963 and, a decade later, the radical Symbionese Liberation Army snatched the publishing heiress Patty Hearst.<br />The kidnappings of the ’30s seem almost quaint compared to the school massacres, drive-by shootings, cyberhacks, radical rioting, pressure-cooker bombings and other grim crimes of today. But they were terrifying in their era. The New York Times began publishing a kidnapping log. Behind the gates of their mansions, rich people quaked for their lives. They hired armed chauffeurs and slept with shotguns and pistols at their bedsides. J.P. Morgan enlisted 250 armed guards for its partners and their families.<br />In “The Snatch Racket,” Carolyn Cox, a veteran Washington lawyer and law professor, reanimates this intriguing slice of American life. Crisp, zesty and free of the clichés of most true-crime writing, Ms. Cox’s book interweaves her case narratives with the inside story of how Hoover exploited the crisis to launch a “crusade” against organized crime, even coining the term “G-men” to glamorize his agents.</td>

Freezers in key port cities are also filling up, often leaving seafood with nowhere to go once it is unloaded, and prompting importers to shuttle fish between warehouses or across longer distances to find cold storage.<br />Those bottlenecks are running up against Lent, when many Christians abstain from meat and Americans eat more seafood than during any other time of year, retail data show. Most seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported, and soaring transportation and logistics costs are erasing profits on some container loads of fish. Higher costs are rippling through the supply chain, executives said, helping push up seafood prices for consumers alongside other rising food costs.<br />Kim Gorton, chief executive of Boston-based seafood supplier Slade Gorton & Co., said importers have had containers of seafood stuck at ports for up to three weeks, with related storage charges eating up profit on the fish in days. Her company has had varieties like shrimp and cod held up for days, and she has had to ferry loads of salmon between freezers to make room for other shipments.<br />“The entire system is seized up,” Ms. Gorton said. “A lot of us are basically driving product around to find if there is any room at the inn.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The House voted 224 to 206 Thursday on legislation to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, an expansive effort that has spurred fierce opposition among conservatives over religious freedom and set off a new round of partisan fighting in Congress.<br />The measure, known as the Equality Act, marks a major plank of what Democrats term their equality agenda, following earlier laws treating attacks against gay people as hate crimes and allowing gay people to serve openly in the military. The Equality Act would amend the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination based on race, religion, sex and other characteristics, to include sexual orientation and gender identity.<br />“It is needed because there is discrimination against people in the LGBTQ community,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said on Thursday. “It breaks my heart that it is necessary,” she said, choking up a press conference.<br />The White House supports the legislation but its fate in the Senate is uncertain. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on Thursday declined to say when he would schedule the measure for a vote.<br />In a press conference with the Capitol as a backdrop and later on the House floor, Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus denounced the legislation, saying that it would discriminate against certain adoption agencies that don’t allow adoptions by same-sex parents, undermine women’s sports, and block healthcare providers from declining to perform abortions on the basis of their religious beliefs.</td>

      <td>Lovers of large-scale musicals have been feeling more than usually deprived by the Covid-19 pandemic. In theory, it shouldn’t be impossible to webcast a musical, but it’s technically very difficult—too many people, too much stuff going on—and the only one I’ve reviewed, the Irish Repertory Theatre’s wonderful revival of “Meet Me in St. Louis,” was a scaled-down version in which the actors “phoned in” their performances, taping them from their separate homes, after which they were edited together in the studio. So it is inspiring to report that Virginia’s Signature Theatre, one of the top American regional theaters that specialize in musicals, is webcasting “Simply Sondheim,” a fully-staged 33-song revue directed and choreographed by Matthew Gardiner and performed in the company’s empty 275-seat theater by 12 singers and a 15-player pit orchestra. No, it’s not “Sweeney Todd” on a Broadway-sized stage, but it is fabulously fine in its own right and comes across with irrepressible vitality on a small screen.<br />Signature Theatre’s imaginative revivals of the musicals of Stephen Sondheim have given the company a well-deserved national reputation for excellence. That said, I wasn’t expecting “Simply Sondheim” to be quite as good as it is, since greatest-hits musical revues too often feel aimless. Not this one: Mr. Gardiner’s scenery-free staging, in which the songs are locked together without benefit of plot or connective narration, moves from number to number so quickly that you scarcely have time to catch your breath. “Simply Sondheim” has no dead spots, no slack patches, no weak moments of any kind: Every element of the show is exactly right, including Justin Chiet’s cinematography and the clean, precise playing of the orchestra, which brings out the myriad subtleties of Jonathan Tunick’s original orchestrations.<br />Everyone in the cast is so fine that I’m reluctant to single out any individual member for particular praise. Still, I mustn’t fail to mention Tracy Lynn Olivera, who charges through “Getting Married Today,” the fastest and most notoriously complex of Mr. Sondheim’s tongue-twisting patter songs, in such a way as to make you wonder why her performance didn’t set off a sonic boom in the theater. And that’s not the best part: Ms. Olivera acts the lyrics instead of just tossing them off, thus making the song not merely funny but also moving.<br />Trust me when I tell you, though, that every performer and every performance in “Simply Sondheim” lands squarely on target. (O.K., one more special mention: Norm Lewis sings “Being Alive” with extreme sensitivity.) I would have gladly paid to see this show in the theater, and Signature Theatre should give serious thought to remounting it when the pandemic is over. It deserves real, in-person applause.<br /></td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The fate of Neera Tanden’s nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget came down to two centrist senators after another Republican added his name to the list of lawmakers who oppose confirming her.<br />Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said on Thursday that he would vote against Ms. Tanden. Mr. Grassley, who often votes with other Republicans but has backed many of President Biden’s cabinet nominees so far, hadn’t disclosed his position.<br />The White House is now homing in on Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) and Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.), people involved in the discussions said. A “no” vote from either senator, neither of whom has so far tipped her hand, would doom Ms. Tanden’s chances of clearing the Senate.<br />Executive-branch nominations require a majority vote of 51 senators to pass the chamber. Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie. Because control of the Senate is divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans, a single Democratic defection can throw a nomination into uncertainty.<br />Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said last week that he would vote against Ms. Tanden, meaning a Republican would have to break with other members of the party and join the remaining 49 Democrats for the nomination to pass. If Ms. Sinema joins Mr. Manchin in opposing her, Ms. Tanden would need a second Republican to cross party lines, an outcome that Senate aides said was unlikely.</td>

The five-year yield rose to 0.799% Thursday from its previous close of 0.612%—the largest one day gain since December 2010.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed after Labor Department data showed that the number of jobless claims fell sharply last week, signaling the job market could be stabilizing after layoffs edged higher earlier in the winter.<br />Investors tend to sell Treasurys when they expect faster growth and inflation, which lowers the value of bonds’ fixed payments and can eventually lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s pick for U.S. Trade Representative said she would accelerate negotiations with the European Union to resolve a longstanding dispute over commercial-aircraft subsidies, citing the fight’s negative impact across several industries.<br />Speaking at her confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee, Katherine Tai, a veteran government trade lawyer, said the 16-year-old dispute over how governments subsidize  Boeing Co.  and  Airbus SE  has led to counter-tariffs—sanctioned by the World Trade Organization—on food and beverage products, causing “disruption” and “pain.”<br />“At the core of this…is the need for the U.S. and the EU to come together to figure out an answer,” Ms. Tai said. “I would very much be interested in figuring out how to land this particular plane because it has been going on for a very long time.”<br />Restaurant and beverage industries have been pushing for a solution to the aircraft dispute, which has heaped pressure on businesses already struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic. The Trump administration imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European wine and food items such as cheese and olives in late 2019. The EU hit back with levies on U.S. whiskey, nuts and tobacco.<br />The EU’s trade commissioner, Vladis Dombrovskis, called for a mutual suspension of tariffs in the aircraft dispute this month.</td>

      <td>Imagine for a moment two objects in your hands. One is a piece of paper and the other a rubber band. If you squeeze your hands together hard and let go, the paper will remain crumpled, but the rubber band will return to its original shape.<br />Economists tend to think of the economy as the rubber band. After a shock, they expect it to go back to normal. When it doesn’t, like the crumpled paper, they call the effect “hysteresis”—lasting changes caused by some large perturbation. The Covid-19 pandemic is a classic example. What permanent damage to the economy will it leave behind?<br />The first place to look is in classrooms, say Eric Hanushek and Margaret Raymond, economists and education researchers at Stanford University. Lost study time for children during the pandemic has the potential to do lasting harm not just to their own long-term prospects but to American prosperity in general, say the married couple.<br />Ms. Raymond studied 18 states and Washington, D.C. and concluded that, on average, children lost 116 days of reading time during the early stages of the pandemic last year and 215 days of math work—instruction that will be hard to regain and could leave a whole generation of children struggling to keep up in their studies and testing. If your child misses out on learning fractions now, how will she perform in algebra later?<br />And the shock has been distributed unevenly. Children in rural areas and areas with large Black and Hispanic populations were hit the hardest. Among the states suffering the most are South Carolina and Illinois, according to Ms. Raymond’s study.</td>

Then I simply purchased the book directly from its publisher, Encounter, at a reasonable price with a 15% first-time discount to boot.

Democrats, who can’t afford to lose a single vote among their own ranks to pass the bill in an evenly divided Senate, have split over the push to raise the federal minimum wage, which would boost it to $15 an hour over four years.<br />“We’re waiting, as we all are, to hear from the Senate parliamentarian as to what will happen with the minimum wage piece of the legislation,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) told reporters Thursday. “I feel that we have a very, very strong argument and we have a very big need in our country to pass the minimum wage.”<br />The minimum-wage increase is the most divisive issue in the aid package, which Democrats broadly support. The package would also provide a $1,400 payment to many Americans; extend and enhance federal unemployment assistance; send $350 billion in aid to state and local governments; and pour new funding into vaccine distribution, food stamps and schools.<br />Democratic and Republican staff made their arguments before the parliamentarian Wednesday morning on the minimum-wage provision and have been waiting since then to hear her recommendation.</td>

The intersection’s namesake is on view in a portrait that occupies one corner, the eyes hidden behind sunglasses, a baleful look balancing on his face. It’s the perfect representation of a public persona.<br />The marvelous thing about the documentary “Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell” is the way it gets behind the image, and the sunglasses, to the heavy kid with the lazy eye who grew up on a nearby tree-lined block—off the “bad luck avenue,” as he himself will call it—and became one of the biggest stars of hip hop, maybe its best.<br />“You have no origins for what rap planet this guy came from,” says Sean Combs, aka Puff Daddy aka P. Diddy, the rapper-producer for whose Bad Boy label Wallace recorded his debut album (“Ready to Die,” the only one released before the rapper’s shooting death, at age 24, in 1997). Mr. Combs is lavish in his praise of Wallace’s talents with the mic, and the rhymes. His sentiments are echoed throughout Emmett Malloy’s almost too-short documentary.<br />Produced in cooperation with Wallace’s estate—his mother, Voletta, is an executive producer as well as the film’s emotional center—“Biggie” benefits from simply being a great story, an American story, almost a Horatio Alger tale if Ragged Dick had sold crack on Fulton while being careful not to let his mother catch him. Mr. Malloy also benefits from having at his disposal the apparently vast video archive of childhood friend and posse member Damion Butler, who taped everything and began early: Wallace would often instruct him, Mr. Butler recalls, to record the audiences rather than the performances, to see what numbers and lyrics went over best and how they could calibrate the flow of a show. It’s an invaluable resource for director Malloy, as is the willingness of so many Wallace friends and associates to talk—not just celebrities like Mr. Combs, but Brooklynites who knew Wallace when he was a kid living with his single mom, dropping out of school and succumbing to the lure of the crack trade.<br />Mr. Butler is one. Another is the jazz saxophonist Donald Harrison, who lived near the Wallace apartment and took the young music fan under his wing. One of the more captivating and revealing segments involves Mr. Harrison’s recollection of having introduced his protégé to the work of Max Roach and the jazz immortal’s use of polyrhythms and tonal percussion. Mr. Malloy doesn’t just let us draw our own conclusions about the consequent influence of Roach’s drumming on Wallace’s rapping. He overlays a Roach solo on a Wallace performance and the result is not just an uncanny musical moment but, in case one needed it, something of a validation of rap as serious musical art. (No one mentions it, but Roach grew up in the neighborhood, too, only a few blocks from where Wallace and Harrison lived.)</td>

      <td>Starring Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, Florian Zeller’s feature explores the mind of a man experiencing memory loss.</td>
      <td>In one sense “The Father,” opening in theaters, amounts to a chamber piece. It’s a relatively small-scale production that centers on a widower father and his dutiful daughter. Eighty-year-old Anthony, played by Anthony Hopkins, lives alone in his quite comfortable London flat, though with ever more difficulty as his memory declines and his confusion grows. Anne, played by Olivia Colman, visits him as often as she can, though she’s no substitute for any of the full-time caregivers he has tolerated briefly, then chased away. Yet the film looms large dramatically because its true chamber is Anthony’s mind, a fantastical place where memories swirl, delusions dance, pleasures beckon, terrors arise unbidden and people both beloved and mistrusted keep splitting off into other identities. The two Anthonys, by contrast, coalesce. Actor merges with character in a performance that’s astonishing and inspiring in equal measure.<br />The screenplay was adapted by Christopher Hampton from a French stage play by Florian Zeller, who is making an auspicious debut as a feature director. (His work finds its complement in the probing yet unobtrusive cinematography of Ben Smithard. Ludovico Einaudi wrote the music.) It takes a while—at least it took me a while—to realize that Mr. Zeller and his collaborators are playing intricate mind games with the audience in order to reflect the disjunctures of its hero’s inner life. What might have been predictable or sentimental in other hands becomes startling in the film’s approach, as well as beguiling, unsparing, terribly moving and occasionally very funny.<br />Mr. Hopkins is the master of it all. He pulls us in with huge vigor that alternates with urgent intimacy. He’s so powerful when he wants to be that he chooses to make coiled self-containment his default mode. He’s seldom off screen, and each new scene has us wondering exactly what Anne wonders—what is her father up to today, or this hour, or minute? Who will he be now?<br />It’s not that Anthony is incoherent, only mercurial in a way that mercury would be if it could switch between bright and dark. In seductive mode he’s an irresistible charmer, and adept at dancing, which he says he used to do professionally, though Anne reminds him that he was an engineer. Yet the charm can turn frighteningly grotesque, giving way to hurt and rage in the time it takes for Anthony to turn his outwardly calm gaze inward. He’s marvelously manipulative, but he still can’t manipulate his surroundings, whatever they are—he isn’t necessarily where he thinks he is—into staying put long enough for him to feel safe. (Anne, portrayed poignantly by Ms. Colman, has her own delusional notions, mainly the possibility that her father will rally and get better.)<br />Watching “The Father” I thought of Arthur Kopit—not because of his signature play with the long title that begins “Oh Dad, Poor Dad,” but because of his remarkable “Wings,” a radio play set inside the disordered mind of a stroke victim who can no longer find the words for her thoughts. I also recalled Richard L. Gregory’s “Eye and Brain,” a book on visual perception. In it the author asks why, when we move our eyes, the world around us doesn’t move too; the answer has to do with the brain and retina working in concert to maintain a stable image.</td>

      <td>Intelligence agents attempt to solve an extraterrestrial mystery in NBC’s new sci-fi drama.</td>
      <td>It’s a dangerous thing to become infatuated with the first episode of a series, because pilots can be like first dates: Everything is candy and flowers, but what follows can be years of domestic drudgery, boredom and an acrimonious divorce. Still, it’s hard not to warm to NBC’s ambitious “Debris,” which may just sweep viewers off their feet.<br />This will be especially true of sci-fi fans, who have seen it all, maybe even imagined it all and might still be taken aback, not just by the unfolding details of the storyline but the way it plays hard-to-get. It’s in no rush to provide details, only mood. You don’t quite know what’s happening, so you lean in to learn more. It’s a common enough technique, but one very seductively executed by the show’s creator, J.H. Wyman (“Almost Human,” “Fringe”).<br />In it, “Debris” supposes that a spaceship of unknown origin has come apart, violently it seems, and the pieces are descending to Earth and causing mischief. And worse. Aggravating matters for U.S. intelligence agent Bryan Beneventi (Jonathan Tucker) and his British colleague, Finola Jones of MI6 (Riann Steele), is that the fragments of debris they’re hunting down have hit the black market and are being bought up by such dubious characters as Anson Ash (Scroobius Pip).<br />Why? The power of the pieces isn’t totally clear, of course. Future episodes will no doubt clarify. But the black, animated shards of spacecraft seem to tap into people’s grief, resurrecting their loved ones—in some ephemeral form, at least—and after using up one human’s emotions move on to another, as if changing batteries. The used-up human bodies are left levitating a foot in the air, seemingly alive and conscious but in suspended animation.<br />How is this working out for everyone? Not well. Both Bryan and Finola are like first responders in a pandemic—as susceptible to the influence of the debris as anyone else. They must avoid and resist. They also have specific motives for being where they are: Bryan, whom one assumes is CIA, has been in Afghanistan and is looking for something equally meaningful to do. Finola, whose late astrophysicist father had been “the first to be told the truth” about the pictures taken by the Hubble telescope of the “debris cloud” resulting from the mysterious cosmic event, has been born into the space-garbage game.</td>

      <td>In Lee Daniels’s feature, Andra Day stars as the celebrated vocalist, who was pursued by the federal government as part of its war on drugs.</td>
      <td>‘The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” starring Andra Day and streaming on Hulu, is a muddled chronicle of the persecution visited on the peerless jazz vocalist in the 1940s by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and its commissioner, Harry Anslinger. (He’s played coarsely by Garrett Hedlund.)<br />The thrust of the film is valid, and horrifying even now—perhaps especially now, when we’ve gained a deeper understanding of America’s racial history. Anslinger did pursue Billie, who was addicted to heroin, in order to racialize his agency’s so-called war on drugs. He was indeed obsessed with one of her signature songs, “Strange Fruit,” and tried to prevent her from singing it in public because its lyrics describe a lynching in shocking detail. And he sought to trap her with a sting operation led by Jimmy Fletcher (an appealing performance by Trevante Rhodes), a Black agent who did, by all accounts, fall in love with her. But none of that potentially powerful material has been organized into effective drama. It’s as if the filmmakers thought they’d have a full-fledged movie if they just kept recycling the “Strange Fruit” element often enough. (Lee Daniels directed from a screenplay by Suzan-Lori Parks, who adapted parts of the book “Chasing the Scream” by Johann Hari.)<br />The best thing about the production is the casting of Ms. Day in the title role. It’s no news that she’s a gifted singer, and her acting here swings between affecting and more than adequate, though there’s no way of knowing if her tentative moments are a result of Mr. Daniels’s clumsy and erratic direction. The problem with her performance lies in the constricting mimicry she’s been asked to do. Ms. Day gets the rasp and quiver, and she’s good on “Ain’t Nobody’s Business” because the relatively up-tempo song seems to release her from the mimic’s task. What’s missing in the slow ballads, including “Strange Fruit,” is what no other singer could ever touch, the uncut pain and piercing heartbreak born of Billie’s tragic childhood and early years.<br />Other aspects of the jazz scene as depicted are silly, and this is a story that can’t feel authentic without a convincing musical context. The tenor saxophone virtuoso Lester Young (Tyler James Williams), a formidable force in his own right and an essential part of Billie’s musical and personal life over several decades, appears to be a mostly affable, overgrown kid. A fleeting Louis Armstrong cameo is too foolish for words, let alone music, though no more so than the nonmusical figure of the actress and Billie’s friend Tallulah Bankhead (Natasha Lyonne), whose screen time is mercifully brief.<br />Glitches mar the history. Recording a V-Disc—a label created to provide music for U.S. military personnel during World War II—Billie tells her audience, “You’re fighting a real fight out there.” Where, though? It’s 1947, and the war has been over for two years. The physical production is patchy, indicating budgetary constraints. Grand Central Terminal in 1948 appears to be a really big room. But the film fails most importantly, almost inexplicably, at telling its story of governmental abuse and personal suffering in a coherent fashion. And the disorganization of Ms. Parks’s script is enhanced by a succession of montages that must have been put together to camouflage narrative gaps. (In the most annoying of them, Billie is on stage singing, but for some perverse reason we can’t hear her.) The running time is 130 minutes but feels like three hours because of the glacial pace and a consistent lack of dramatic energy. Billie was a user, for sure, but how to explain the drugginess of everyone else?</td>

      <td>Social-media platform aimed high with an ambitious set of targets Thursday</td>
      <td>Twitter  is a destination for fact and for fluff. Both are often taken with equal weight.<br />Elon Musk’s infamous 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private and venture capitalist Chamath Paliahapitiya’s tweet earlier this year signaling a California gubernatorial run come to mind. Neither panned out.<br />On Thursday, Twitter showed it can mic drop with the best of them. Its shares flew as much as 12% higher in advance of the company’s virtual investor day. In a regulatory filing Thursday morning, Twitter set forth three lofty goals for the next three years: By the end of 2023, the company said it would work to at least double its revenue, reach at least 315 million monetizable daily active users and essentially double one internal measure of the pace of features released. Now its investors have to hope the platform can back up its own proclamations better than those of its prominent users.<br />It is hard to know which of Twitter’s goals is most ambitious. Estimates compiled by Visible Alpha show Wall Street wasn’t expecting Twitter to hit that level of revenue and users until 2025 and 2027, respectively. Getting there by 2023 will require rapid innovation, which doesn’t come cheap: Twitter’s earlier outlook for this year called for 20% head-count growth and 25% growth in cost and expenses on an annual basis. Taken together, Twitter’s announcements sound something like the aggressive direction activist Elliott Management pushed for last year, when it advocated for Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey’s removal, asserting his attention was stretched too thin by leading two companies at once.<br />Mr. Dorsey’s ability to meet these new targets may determine whether he remains in or goes out at the top. His kickoff comments on Thursday were fitting, highlighting lack of speed, innovation and trust as Twitter’s three key weaknesses. Mr. Dorsey noted Twitter’s work to rebuild its ad server is already paying off, resulting in 31% ad revenue growth in the fourth quarter versus the year prior. And while it used to take six to 12 months to get a new product to its customers, Twitter is now working toward getting a new feature or product out in under a few weeks, he said.</td>

The resulting draw on power and natural gas supplies forced closures of plants that manufactured animal feed and processed milk, creating a calamity for a major meat- and fruit-producing region.<br />Chicken company  Sanderson Farms Inc.  said Thursday it had euthanized 545,000 chicks in Texas that couldn’t be shipped to farms from hatcheries due to hazardous road conditions. Chief Executive Joe Sanderson said another 455,000 chickens died due to frigid temperatures, shortages in water and feed, and collapsed buildings on farms. Another 703,000 hatching eggs were lost, he said.<br />“We deeply regret the losses incurred due to extraordinary circumstances,” Mr. Sanderson said on a conference call Thursday.<br />For Texas orange and grapefruit growers, who represent the third-largest citrus growing state, the wintry blast’s timing was catastrophic. The bitter cold likely destroyed 98% of the current Valencia orange crop and 55% of grapefruit, according to Dale Murden, a citrus grower and president of Texas Citrus Mutual, a farmer organization.</td>

The next day, XRT tumbled nearly 10% as GameStop’s rally relented.<br />The fund ended up losing $506 million in assets, representing three-quarters of its total assets at the time. Redemptions were driven in part by wide discounts between the ETF’s share price and net asset value and a desire to get a hold of GameStop shares held by the fund, traders said.<br />The drama has reshaped XRT’s profile to some extent. The fund offers a way for investors to bet on a swath of the retail sector, typically offering roughly equal exposure to GameStop as to the likes of  Amazon.com Inc.,   Macy’s Inc.  and  Kohl’s Corp.</td>

      <td>Historic Caffè Florian, the city’s most opulent coffeehouse and unofficial hub for Carnival, was a gleeful time warp until Covid temporarily closed it last year</td>
      <td>For the Time Capsule series, we spotlight a cherished restaurant, hotel or landmark that’s changed remarkably little over the years. This week, we visit Caffè Florian in Venice, Italy.<br />Founded in 1720 as “Alla Venezia Trionfante” (Venice the Triumphant), the famous coffeehouse on the city’s Piazza San Marco, soon became known by its owner’s name, Florian. For decades, it served as Venice’s literary and philosophical hub, drawing any number of well-known eggheads, including Goethe, Charles Dickens and Marcel Proust. The cafe also played a role in several early political controversies: In 1796, for example, Venetian authorities shut it down temporarily, worried that pro-revolutionary Jacobins were congregating there, while in 1848, it was the favored meeting spot for Venetian separatists who wanted to see the city-state independent from the Austrian Empire. One of Florian’s most ornate rooms, the “Senate Hall,” redecorated in 1893, is filled with hidden, politically subversive visual references to Freemasonry. The current cafe’s sumptuous style—including ornately frescoed, gilded and mirrored rooms, like the “Oriental Salon,” and “Chinese Salon”—largely dates back to renovations carried out in the mid-19th century. The newest room, the Art Deco-inspired “Sala Liberty,” was added to the café in 1920.<br />In any normal February, Florian would double as the unofficial Studio 54 of the annual carnevale, hosting elaborately decked-out revelers within its no less extravagant front rooms. This year was to be particularly raucous—Florian celebrated its 300th birthday last December. But the pandemic, and the loss of nearly 12 months’ worth of tourism, has forced the cafe to temporarily close, with no clear reopening date. Fortunately, nostalgists craving prosecco in a Florian-branded glass can still buy them online. For now, however, both the institution’s staff and its regulars remain in limbo. According to assistant headwaiter Roberto Ferronato, a few costumed carnevale regulars still showed up this month, fully masked, to mourn outside the boarded-up windows. “Who could have imagined something that not even World Wars have caused,” said Mr. Ferronato, whose tenure dates to 1986, of the coronavirus-linked closure. “The bitterness that pervades me is great.” Michele Bronzin, a barman at Florian, calls it more than just a café. “It’s a medicine,” he said.<br />During its 300-year history, Florian has drawn some of the most notable figures in European history. Here are a few of the cafe’s most famous guests.<br />The Venetian nobleman and memoirist, known for the innumerable romantic conquests he recorded in his diary, visited Florian not merely for its fine coffee and pleasant atmosphere, but also for its clientele. It was the only café in the city to admit women, and thus prime territory for the Lothario.</td>

Whatever comes out of it won’t come for years,” Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of  Nvidia Corp. —America’s biggest semiconductor company by value—said after the White House announced the executive action Wednesday aimed at addressing chip and other supply-chain bottlenecks. “There will be no immediate results,” Mr. Huang said.<br />The pandemic has supercharged demand for chips that go into everything from videogames and laptop computers to data centers, products that have become central to remote work and distance learning. Rebounding demand in other industries has exacerbated the scarcity of chip production capacity, industry executives have said.<br />“So much of society is run by that now,” Mr. Huang said Wednesday shortly after Nvidia posted record quarterly sales. “We need chips more than ever, which is great.”<br />But that demand surge has caught some industries out, particularly auto makers.  General Motors Co. ,  Ford Motor Co.  and  Volkswagen AG  have idled some of their production capacity as they await critical parts. Car makers are expected to produce around 700,000 fewer cars in the first three months of 2021 than earlier forecast because of chip shortages.</td>

      <td>Winston Churchill made the term famous, but ideological rivalries have driven geopolitics since Athens and Sparta.</td>
      <td>Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today’s world. Read previous columns here.<br />It was an unseasonably springlike day on March 5, 1946, when Winston Churchill visited Fulton, Missouri. The former British Prime Minister was ostensibly there to receive an honorary degree from Westminster College. But Churchill’s real purpose in coming was to urge the U.S. to form an alliance with Britain to keep the Soviet Union from expanding any further. Speaking before an august audience that included President Harry S. Truman, Churchill declared: “From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent.”<br />Churchill wasn’t the first person to employ the phrase “iron curtain” as a political metaphor. Originally a theatrical term for the safety barrier between the stage and the audience, by the early 20th century it was being used to mean a barrier between opposing powers. Nevertheless, “iron curtain” became indelibly associated with Churchill and with the defense of freedom and democracy.<br />This was a modern expression of an idea first articulated by the ancient Greeks: that political beliefs are worth defending. In the winter of 431-30 B.C., the Athenians were staggering under a devastating plague while simultaneously fighting Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. The stakes couldn’t have been higher when the great statesman Pericles used a speech commemorating the war dead to define the struggle in terms that every Athenian would understand.<br />As reported by the historian Thucydides, Pericles told his compatriots that the fight wasn’t for more land, trade or treasure; it was for democracy pure and simple. Athens was special because its government existed “for the many instead of the few,” guaranteeing “equal justice to all.” No other regime, and certainly not the Spartans, could make the same claim.</td>

      <td>A hearing for a transgender person nominated by President Biden for a top administration health position turned tense Thursday as she was pressed over her stance on gender dysphoria treatment for minors.<br />Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky started his questioning by mentioning “genital mutilation” to Dr. Rachel Levine, the nominee for assistant health secretary.<br />He then asked her during Thursday’s Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing if she supports hormone therapy or sex-reassignment therapy in minors with gender dysphoria. “We should be outraged that someone’s talking to a three year old about changing their sex,” said Mr. Paul, an ophthalmologist.<br />Mr. Paul added, “You give a woman enough testosterone to grow a beard, you think she’ll go back?”<br />Gender dysphoria—a conflict between a person’s sex assigned at birth and the gender with which a person identifies—is recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and other professional associations as a medical issue.</td>

That schedule is subject to change and market conditions could alter TuSimple’s plans.<br />Morgan Stanley  is the lead banker on the IPO, the people said. TuSimple said it raised $215 million in a 2019 financing round that valued it at $1.2 billion. It has since raised more capital but declined to share its latest valuation. Other financial details about the coming IPO weren’t immediately available.<br />A spokeswoman for TuSimple declined to comment on the company’s IPO plans.<br />The IPO filing confirms TuSimple’s intention to pursue a traditional public listing versus merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which is also known as a blank-check company. Last year, TuSimple considered going public with a SPAC, people with knowledge of the discussions said.</td>

Rival  Walmart Inc.  recently said it would raise wages for some workers but keep its starting wage at $11 an hour. Costco has about 180,000 full-time and part-time U.S. employees.<br />Capitol Hill waited Thursday for the Senate parliamentarian to weigh in on whether the chamber’s rules would permit Democrats to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour as part of President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.<br />Costco has long paid its store workers more than most competitors, in part to reduce turnover as part of its low-cost operating model. Costco Chief Executive Craig Jelinek said at the hearing Thursday that Costco’s average wage for hourly workers is $24 an hour. Walmart’s average U.S. wage after recent increases take effect will be more than $15 an hour, the company has said.<br />“Although there’s a lot of external focus on starting wages and minimums, it is important to us that Costco employees have an opportunity to make more than $15 or $16,” he said, noting the company offers regular raises, bonuses and healthcare benefits. About 89% of workers are currently eligible for healthcare coverage, he said.</td>

      <td>What happens if financial regulators try to address the climate? Expect the usual corporate favoritism.</td>
      <td>The House Financial Services Committee holds a hearing Thursday on “Climate Change and Social Responsibility: Helping Corporate Boards and Investors Make Decisions for a Sustainable World.” This follows a flurry of Biden administration initiatives to thrust climate change to the forefront of financial regulation. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has announced her department will create a “climate hub,” complete with a “climate czar.” As Ms. Yellen stated at her confirmation hearing, the goal is to ensure that financial regulators “seriously look at assessing the risk to the financial system from climate change.” This plan will accomplish nothing to save the planet but will surely amount to a tax on borrowers and investors.<br />Ms. Yellen, congressional Democrats and others seem to believe that financial regulators have a unique ability to affect the environment. Last week Federal Reserve Board member Lael Brainard gave a speech titled “The Role of Financial Institutions in Tackling the Challenges of Climate Change,” in which she said, “Robust risk management, scenario analysis and forward planning can help ensure financial institutions are resilient to climate-related risks and well-positioned to support the transition to a more sustainable economy.” Her point is true as far as it goes, but it would be equally true for any other issue one might substitute for “climate-related.” Proponents of financial solutions don’t do nearly enough to explain how they would weigh the trade-offs of their policy approach.<br />Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, U.S. financial regulation has focused on predicting, measuring and protecting against outsize risks to the financial system. Dodd-Frank created a new regulatory panel, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, for exactly that purpose. All this was premised on the idea that the Great Recession had led to an intolerable amount of taxpayer support for Wall Street that must never be repeated—hence the FSOC, which would require banks to be properly prepared for future calamities.<br />Unfortunately, the FSOC was unable to predict a global pandemic. By failing to require banks to hold enough capital to shore up the financial system last year, regulators left open the need for a more piecemeal but ultimately much larger bailout of American finance. Since last March, the Fed has provided unlimited liquidity not only to banks but also to businesses and even governments. This has been supplemented by Congress, whose profligate pandemic spending has added trillions of dollars to the national debt.<br />The point isn’t to chide financial regulators for responding to the pandemic. It’s to show that their usual policy tool kit is ill-suited to prevent unpredictable future threats, especially ones as uncertain as climate change.</td>

      <td>Companies don’t know how big or long-lasting the economic rebound might be. But they need to gear up for it.<br />The Commerce Department reported Thursday that orders for durable goods—long-lasting items that run the gamut from sheet metal to shipping containers—rose 3.4% in January from December, putting them 4.5% above their level of a year earlier, before the Covid-19 crisis struck. That jump indicates that a powerful “bullwhip effect”, where businesses’ efforts to rebuild inventories ripple through the economy, has taken hold.<br />Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft—a closely watched proxy for capital spending—rose a more muted 0.5% in January from December. That was up 9.1% from a year earlier, however, and in the months ahead the demand for capital goods might only build.<br />In considering capital spending plans, businesses face a bit of a dilemma. The decline in new Covid cases in recent weeks, the vaccine rollout and the likelihood of another round of government relief suggest that sales could surge.<br />But by how much, and in what areas? It seems probable that services spending will really pick up as Americans return to more normal activities, so service-sector businesses need to prepare for that. Goods spending might soften as a result—or maybe not. Moreover, the release of pent-up demand could carry the economy through the end of the year, but what sort of legs the rebound might have after that is unclear.</td>

      <td>Research shows that daydreaming and woolgathering are specialized mental functions with a unique pattern of brain waves.</td>
      <td>Psychologist Alison Gopnik explores new discoveries in the science of human nature. Read previous columns here.<br />There’s only one way to write: Just do it. But there seem to be a million ways not to write. I sit down to work on my column, write a sentence and—ping!—there’s a text with a video of my new baby grandson. One more sentence and I start ruminating about the latest virus variant, triggering a bout of obsessive Covid worry. Cut it out! I tell myself, and write one more sentence, and then I’m staring blankly out the window, my mind wandering: What was it with that weird movie last night? Should I make chicken pilaf or lamb tagine for dinner?<br />These different kinds of thinking are the subject of a paper I co-authored recently in the journal PNAS, which has an interesting back story. Zachary Irving is a brilliant young philosopher now at the University of Virginia, well-trained—as philosophers have to be—at thinking about thinking. He is especially interested in the kind of unconstrained thought we have when our mind wanders. Is mind-wandering really distinct from other kinds of thought, like simple distraction or obsessive rumination? And why do we do it so much?<br />Young children daydream a lot, so Zach came to visit my lab at Berkeley, where we study children’s thinking. Neuroscience has mainly focused on goal-directed, task-oriented thinking, but what is your brain doing when your mind wanders? To answer that question, we worked with Julia Kam, now at the University of Calgary, and Robert Knight to design an experiment that involved giving 45 people a tedious but demanding task: pressing an arrow when a cue appeared on the screen. The participants did this more than 800 times for 40 minutes, and at random intervals we asked them to report what they were thinking. Were they thinking about the task or something else? Were they obsessing about a single topic or were their minds freely wandering?<br />Meanwhile, the participants’ brain waves were being measured with electroencephalography or EEG. The study found that different types of thinking correspond to different brain wave patterns. Like earlier researchers, we found that brain waves are different when you pay attention to a task and when you get distracted. But we found that different types of distraction also have different brain signatures. We compared what happens when your mind is captured by an internal obsession like worrying about Covid, and what happens when it wanders freely.</td>

Technology and evolving customer tastes have driven down the costs of investing, squeezing money managers’ margins and forcing firms to consider mergers that give them the scale to compete. The U.S. banking industry’s consolidation wave began decades ago, leaving JPMorgan as one of a handful of systematically important lenders.<br />TIAA manages $1.3 trillion in assets through its retirement accounts and investment funds.</td>

The military had earlier added its voice to growing demands across Armenia that Mr. Pashinyan step down amid a growing outcry over his handling of last year’s conflict, in which parts of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh returned to Azeri control after Russia negotiated a cease-fire.<br />“The army submits to the people and the prime minister,” Russian news agency Interfax reported Mr. Pashinyan as saying while walking with supporters in Yerevan, the capital. The military responded by saying it issued its resignation call to reflect the position of top officers who had lost confidence in Mr. Pashinyan.<br />Witnesses said they saw military planes in the sky above the city.<br />The tumult reflects broad anger against the terms of the cease-fire over Nagorno-Karabakh, which had been held by ethnic Armenians since the 1990s despite officially lying within Azerbaijan’s boundaries. It could also add to the instability besetting a number of other former Soviet republics, including neighboring Georgia, where police detained the country’s main opposition leader this week, sparking rebukes from the U.S. and Europe. Further complicating the regional balance of power, Turkey has undermined Russia’s traditional influence in the South Caucasus by building stronger military and diplomatic ties with Azerbaijan.</td>

      <td>PEER INTO MY apartment from the apartment across the street to catch me unaware, en dishabille, and you’ll find me in Uniqlo Heattech. From the months of October to May, I am blotted out from head-to-toe in Japan’s finest rayon/poly/acrylic long-johns, spidering from room to room like some middle-aged stagehand or deeply prosaic mime. Rising before the alarm, shucking off pajamas, counting out knee bends; toe touches, climbing into a sweatsuit, huddling into my house coat, breakfasting, attempting correspondences, shambling about my day and muttering to myself—all of this is done as a Heattech never-nude. The only time I am absent my protective sheath is for a desultory shower and the attendant ritual of observing an astonishing volume of emollient disappear into my body and face.<br />Hygge, Fair Isle, Qiviut, toddies. None of this holds any allure for me. I am bad at winter. I don’t like it. Admitting that may guarantee me the cool reception normally reserved for those who conspiratorially reveal that they’re no good at consequences or can’t abide waiting in line. But if the casual dude in shorts, flip flops and a Patagonia vest in subzero weather has taught me anything, it’s that I’m just not epigenetically built for this.<br />The first time I saw snow fall out of the sky I was 22. I grew up in balmy Hong Kong, where toilet paper in the morning is often wet to the touch. Then I moved to south-central Texas, where six months of the year are spent in triple-digit heat that spoils milk in the car ride home. Before moving to New York, I’d only known snow to be sprinkled into water and encased in glass globes. It seemed quixotic and purely cosmetic. It may as well have been glitter.<br />They say that trauma remains in the body. That your assigned meatsuit keeps score. My first winter in New York—the North American blizzard of 2003, also known as the Presidents Day Blizzard or PDII for meteorology enthusiasts—found me shuddering violently in waist-high snow in Red Hook, Brooklyn, waiting for a bus that never came. I wore a laughable jacket from  Burlington Coat Factory  and had nylon Nike Cortezes on my feet. Snow, I learned, was wet. By the time I’d hurled my ice-stiffened clothes onto the bathroom floor, scalding water needling my mottled, purpled gooseflesh, I’d also learned that sunk-cost fallacies, as they relate to New York transit, may well get you killed.<br />Retellings of this harrowing tale didn’t elicit the sympathy one would expect. I was chided by experienced, hardier folk—people who snowboard or “grew up in Chicago”—that I needed base layers. I went with the first kind that popped up on Google. Now, to protect myself against inhospitable climes, I conservatively need four pairs of Heattech in rotation, two on ice. Part of it is function but largely it’s pathology, and whenever I open a ruthlessly Kondo’d drawer to peer at the tender little bundles of lifesaving warmth, I’m struck with profound relief and gratitude. I’m partial to the regular weight for the leaf-changing months, but from Boxing Day onward it’s strictly “extra warm.” I machine wash cold and line dry since the extra warm has a propensity to pill. I prefer the men’s tops—the women’s seem cut exclusively for narrow, short-trunked bodies—and because I find the women’s overly scooped neckline unserious. I get mine all in black because I enjoy a matching pair as the only remaining sartorial consideration I’ll humor on any day without sunlight. And while it may not speak to the haberdashering aspirations of Steve Jobs in Issey Miyake turtlenecks or Zuck in Brunello Cucinelli T-shirts, decision fatigue is real. I may not be personally responsible for a ruinously ambitious tech behemoth, but I did recently switch from English muffins to steel-cut oats, which feels like enough resolutions until next quarter.</td>

Under the law, passed in 2019, news publishers can demand payment for reuse of their content.<br />Australia on Thursday passed a law that tackles many of the same issues, terms of which recently prompted Facebook to remove news from its platform in the country for five days before reversing course after winning some changes from the government.<br />Both laws stem from the same debate: what, if anything, should publishers be paid when their news is available via tech platforms.<br />Publishers argue that news is a significant attraction for services like Google, and that they should receive a share of the companies’ revenue. The tech companies, and tech advocates, respond that they already boost the media companies’ revenue by sending them tens of billions of website visits monthly, and that free linking is the internet’s lifeblood.</td>

The greenback has weakened against the backdrop of a feeble U.S. economy and low interest rates, and as investors have moved money into riskier assets around the world.<br />Although the yuan rallied to the strongest level since mid-2018 to 6.46 per dollar, Beijing’s official response has been relatively mild so far. Since last fall, it has made it easier for traders to bet on a weaker yuan, and allowed more domestic financial institutions to move money out of the country to invest in foreign securities.<br />Economists say that Beijing appears to be comfortable with a stronger yuan now in part because it could help rebalance China’s economy toward consumption and make it cheaper for China to import commodities and chips.<br />“China will evolve into a consumption-driven economy, which means they don’t have to keep an undervalued currency like a typical emerging export-oriented economy,” said Ju Wang, a Hong Kong-based senior FX strategist at  HSBC .  “Beijing is already shifting towards this new model, which means they see a fundamentally stronger currency as more beneficial than harmful for the economy.”</td>

      <td>Small landlords that rely on rental income for their retirement are vulnerable to eviction bans</td>
      <td>Real estate has been touted by financial advisers as a stable investment for those seeking a passive source of income in retirement. But instead of boosting their income, some retirees who invested in residential rental properties are now losing money due to eviction moratoria resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Faced with tenants who can’t pay rent, these mom-and-pop landlords are finding their hands tied under the governmental orders, making them especially vulnerable and, in some cases, at risk of losing the properties securing their retirement.<br />Here’s what you need to know about the moratoria and what you can, and can’t, do when your tenants don’t pay.<br />In January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended the existing eviction moratorium to March 31, 2021. This moratorium prevents landlords from evicting tenants for nonpayment, although tenants can still be evicted for reasons other than not paying rent. To be protected from eviction, tenants must provide a written declaration to their landlord, attesting that they have sought government rental assistance, will earn no more than $99,000 in annual income (or $198,000 if filing a joint tax return), cannot pay their full rent due to loss of income, work hours or extraordinary medical expenses, have used best efforts to make timely partial payments, and would become homeless if evicted. All rental properties are covered, but the CDC moratorium doesn’t apply in any state or local areas that have their own moratorium with the same or greater protection. In those areas, state or local law prevails.<br />Gregory Scott Brown, senior vice president, government affairs, of the National Apartment Association, says that if rent remains unpaid when the moratorium expires, landlords will still need to go through the eviction process to regain possession of their unit. Some eviction laws allow tenants to avoid eviction by paying off the rent debt and some judges in eviction proceedings decide if tenants are liable for back rent. They could rule that tenants don’t have to repay before eviction. Mr. Brown suggests that whenever possible, landlords try to work out a repayment plan with the tenant to keep them in place.<br />Don’t. Don’t shut off utilities either. “The only recourse to regain possession of a unit is through the courts and the eviction process,” says Bob Pinnegar, president and chief executive officer of the National Apartment Association. Take the law into your own hands, and you might be subject to civil or criminal penalties, depending on the jurisdiction. In New York, a court may even allow the tenant back into the apartment, says Howard Poch, a New York City attorney who represents landlords and tenants.</td>

In an ideal scenario, the brewer would be able to mop up some of the excess stock by buying them out, but high borrowings restrict its options.<br />On Thursday, the world’s biggest beer maker said sales in the three months through December increased by 4.5% compared with the same period of 2019, suggesting a continued recovery from the pandemic-related problems of last spring. However, AB InBev’s shares fell 5% in early trading as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization missed forecasts and management gave cautious guidance for 2021.<br />But there is another reason for investors to be wary about the brewer this year. In October, restrictions on the sale of shares worth around 17% of AB InBev’s market value will be lifted. The stock is mainly owned by Marlboro cigarette maker  Altria  and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family. Both were major shareholders in SABMiller when the Anglo-South African brewer was taken over by AB InBev in 2016. The duo opted for a mix of cash and shares in the combined company as payment, and agreed not to sell for five years.<br />At the time, it looked like a great deal. The two got stock in AB InBev at a 50% premium to SABMiller’s undisturbed share price in dollar terms, according to Bernstein analyst Trevor Stirling. However, as the brewer’s share price has more than halved since then, they are down in dollar terms today. The holding has been especially troublesome for Altria: AB InBev’s dividend cuts made the tobacco giant’s earnings volatile in recent years.</td>

That record dates back to 2017, when farmers planted 90.2 million acres of soybeans, according to USDA data.<br />Behind the increase lies a sharp rise in soybean prices over the past eight months—69% since June 1, with the most-active contract on the Chicago Board of Trade trading at $14.26 per bushel on Wednesday, the highest level since July 2014.<br />Prices have been lifted by surging demand for U.S. soybeans in China, where the country continues to rebuild a hog herd that was decimated by African swine fever in 2019.

      <td>Golf can wait. In those early, gray moments Tuesday, when we didn’t know much about the accident involving Tiger Woods—when all we had was some harrowing overhead footage of a crumpled SUV off the side of a winding Southern California road—it was possible to really let your mind wander and worry. Now we know more: Woods is hurt, with broken bones in his right leg and foot, and now has a rod inserted after surgery, but overall, the news is good, very good, considering how it looked at first.<br />Still: golf can wait.<br />Priorities will shift. That’s what happens when something like this occurs. Attention will be paid to Woods’s recovery and rehabilitation, and there will naturally be curiosity about his potential return to his sport—short answer: nobody knows for sure—but his playing status feels like a minor diversion compared with the relief of the big picture. Woods is lucky, and those of us who have loved watching him play golf have to feel a little lucky, too.<br />The sport can wait. “When Tiger wants to talk about golf, we’ll talk about golf,” the PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said.<br />That sounds like the right perspective. There will be a compulsion to accelerate things: that’s our culture, hurry it along, speculate without all of the information, and turn someone else’s life into a daily drama for our own entertainment. There’s going to be a temptation to draw parallels to golf great Ben Hogan’s wreck and recovery, and even though it’s a very different time and set of circumstances, we won’t be able to help ourselves. This has always been a media affliction, but now it’s everywhere. We want it when we want it, and we’re all terribly impatient for clean narratives and quick answers.</td>

      <td>Strain first detected in Britain last year has been found in more than 70 countries, including the U.S.</td>
      <td>LONDON—The U.K. has become a testing ground for how a more-contagious and possibly deadlier coronavirus variant spreads through communities, displacing its less-transmissible ancestors and complicating vaccine rollouts and the lifting of lockdowns.<br />The variant has now been identified in more than 70 countries and 40 U.S. states, and its advance in Britain could help scientists understand its likely trajectory in the U.S. These charts show the spread of the variant around the U.K. and what British scientists are learning about it—including its higher transmissibility and lethality.<br />“Increasingly, since this version of the virus was discovered we’ve really been running two separate pandemics,” said Jason Leitch, national clinical director for Scotland. “That is a warning to other countries.”<br />British scientists detected the new variant in November, and in early December traced its first appearance in the U.K. to the southern English county of Kent, in September. The country was in lockdown in November to suppress a deadly wave of infection that had been building since the fall. British public health officials were mystified by the virus’s ongoing spread in southern England despite those restrictions.<br />When scientists examined the variant’s genome, they found an unusually large number of mutations, some of which pointed to the possibility the new variant could spread more rapidly than pre-existing versions. Further sequencing—and a testing quirk that served as a reliable proxy for the variant’s presence—revealed how quickly the variant rose to dominance.</td>

      <td>The asset manager is betting that its partnership with China’s Ant will give it some reach over the roughly one billion users of its Alipay</td>
      <td>Wall Street has long cultivated China’s biggest investment institutions to make inroads there. Vanguard Group is betting more singularly on the Chinese consumer.<br />The Malvern, Pa., firm told some of China’s biggest state investors last year that it would exit its China institutional business and return the billions of dollars managed for them. Instead, the world’s second-largest asset manager is relying on a partnership with Ant Group Co., China’s biggest digital financial firm and an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., as a main route into China.<br />Vanguard hopes the venture will give it reach to the roughly one billion users of Ant’s payments service, Alipay—and perhaps a channel to sell Vanguard’s funds later. This move plays to a broader growth plan for Vanguard.<br />The firm that built a $7.2 trillion asset-management empire on the back of low-cost index funds is betting growth will come from dispensing financial advice at a fraction of rivals’ prices.<br />But, as Vanguard looks to expand in China, Chief Executive Tim Buckley must also convince Beijing that his firm is as committed to the country as rivals, even after it recently turned away business from some of its big state institutions. Vanguard must also deal with a recent complication: Ant is now revamping its entire business after being warned by Beijing regulators about some of its practices and having its initial public offering scrapped.</td>

      <td>Beer giant AB InBev says alcoholic sparkling waters are helping offset weaker sales of Budweiser</td>
      <td>Americans drinking more hard seltzer through the pandemic helped beer giant  Anheuser-Busch InBev SA  partly offset a continuing slump in sales of Budweiser and Bud Light.<br />Hard seltzers—essentially flavored alcoholic sparkling water—have emerged as one of the hottest parts of the booze market in recent years, tempting more health-conscious drinkers away from beer. In response, AB InBev launched Bud Light Seltzer early last year, has since invested in several new flavors of the brand and recently rolled out Michelob Ultra Hard Seltzer.<br />On Thursday, the world’s biggest brewer said those efforts were paying off, as sales at its “beyond beer” unit, which includes hard seltzer, ready-to-drink cocktails and other products, grew double digits to top over $1 billion.<br />That helped AB InBev report overall fourth-quarter sales growth on an organic basis—which strips out currency moves and acquisitions and divestitures—of 4.5%. Revenue on a reported basis dropped to $12.77 billion from $13.33 billion a year earlier. Net profit jumped to $2.27 billion from $114 million a year earlier, when results were hit by higher finance costs.<br />AB InBev was late to jump on the seltzer wagon, originally driven mainly by White Claw, owned by Mike’s Hard Lemonade Co., and Truly Spiked & Sparkling, made by  Boston Beer Co.  Now, though, the drinks giant sees seltzers as a priority and key way to win back defecting beer drinkers. It said Thursday that its hard seltzer brands grew at double the rate of the industry last year, helped by the launch of Bud Light Seltzer.</td>

      <td>Reopening will be a blessing for U.S. restaurants, but not necessarily for restaurant stock prices</td>
      <td>The end of the Covid-19 emergency will be a godsend for the U.S. restaurant industry. But in the near term, it might not be as good for restaurant shareholders as one might expect.<br />A year after the first coronavirus-fueled market selloff, investors seem to love restaurant stocks as much as Americans love to dine out. And Wall Street has been more than willing to give the industry a pass as Covid-19 and accompanying government restrictions have devastated restaurant traffic and hammered sales.<br />Brinker International ,  which owns Chili’s, is up about 90% over the past year, thanks in part to the successful launch of virtual-chicken-wing concept It’s Just Wings.  Darden Restaurants ,  owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, is up 24% over that same time, while  Cheesecake Factory  has rallied 42%. All three stocks have at least tripled since the pandemic lows of last March. Meanwhile, business continues to be slow; companies have lately reported comparable sales declines on the order of 12% to 22% from a year earlier.<br />There was a sound logic for investors to look past the business weakness. Wall Street typically doesn’t give much weight to one-time financial events, and the impact of a global pandemic would seem to be the mother of such one-time situations. Big chains have also been able to access cheap financing to help get through the lean months. A reopening after months of closed dining rooms means there should be significant pent-up demand, at least in theory. That moment could be coming soon: About 45 million Americans have received at least one dose of a vaccine, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.<br />Meanwhile, consumers have plenty of cash to spend on an evening out, and fresh stimulus checks could soon be on the way. As a bonus, the need to adapt to a socially distanced business model resulted in better off-premise sales models and other investments that should pay off down the road. Massive industrywide comparable sales growth seems likely in the months ahead.</td>

      <td>Employers say eliminating $2.13-an-hour subminimum wage for workers receiving tips could cost jobs and raise prices; plan’s advocates say it would provide consistent income</td>
      <td>How restaurants pay workers would be upended by President Biden’s proposal to raise the minimum wage.<br />The plan, under consideration in Congress, would lift the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current level of $7.25 an hour for all workers that has been in place since 2009. The proposal also would eliminate a subminimum wage of as little as $2.13 an hour for millions of workers such as servers or bartenders who receive tips. Both changes would be phased in over several years and largely eliminate a patchwork of state wage laws.<br />In most states, businesses can pay tipped workers less than others, so long as those employees earn at least the minimum wage after tips are added. Under the proposal, restaurants in 32 states could have increased direct labor costs of between $10 and $13 an hour, with businesses in several more states facing increases of $5 to $10 an hour. Seven states, including California, don’t have a subminimum wage for tipped workers.<br />Worker advocates say eliminating the tipped wage would mean servers and others would have more consistent income and wouldn’t potentially need to ask for more pay when tips fall short. The restaurant industry says the existing tip structure means many jobs already pay well above the minimum wage, and that the Biden plan would put jobs at risk while restaurants are still hurting from the pandemic.<br />Senate Democrats are divided over the proposal, with some lawmakers pressing for a smaller increase and others raising concerns about the proposal’s approach to tipped wages. Some Republicans have indicated support for a wage increase, but haven’t embraced the Democrats’ plan.</td>

      <td>ISLAMABAD—Pakistan and India agreed to a cease-fire along their disputed border, regarded as one of the most dangerous frontiers in the world, according to a joint statement from the two countries Thursday.<br />The surprise cease-fire agreement was for the area along the so-called Line of Control, which marks the point at which the two armies stand off in the Kashmir region. It forms an unofficial border across which there is frequent shooting. Each side holds a part of Kashmir but claims the whole of that territory. India and Pakistan are nuclear armed, and there have been three major wars between them, as well as smaller conflicts.<br />The cease-fire came into effect from midnight Wednesday, according to the joint statement. It followed a conversation between senior military officers of the two countries over a hotline, in a “a free, frank and cordial atmosphere,” the statement said.<br />“This is a positive step forward,” said Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Pakistan’s foreign minister, speaking to a local news channel.<br />Each country accuses the other of unprovoked gun, mortar and artillery fire across the disputed border, with fighting escalating in recent years and killing both soldiers and civilians.</td>
