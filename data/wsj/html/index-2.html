      <td>The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone rose in May to hit the European Central Bank’s target for the first time since late 2018, as energy prices surged in response to a strengthening recovery in the global economy.<br />The pickup in price rises comes before a June 10 meeting of policy makers at the eurozone’s central bank, which will consider new economic forecasts and whether to continue stimulus programs launched early in the pandemic.<br />The central bank’s March forecasts saw inflation reaching 2% only in the final three months of this year. But figures released by the European Union’s statistics office Tuesday showed that inflation had already reached that level.<br />The central bank targets an inflation rate of just under 2%.<br />Consumer prices were falling as recently as December. The speed of the turnaround will likely energize a debate among policy makers about whether the pickup is a temporary consequence of economies reopening—or something more durable.</td>

Students can click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before June 15. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />A Good Way to Inflate Tuition<br />Canceling student loan debt is a short-term solution that will only encourage universities to raise tuition. They won’t lose applicants over cost increases. Parents who can’t pay will expect the feds to step in. As a result, the next generation of students will be met with the same or worse debt problems, causing another student-loan cancellation initiative. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, every dollar in subsidized loans results in a 60-cent increase in the sticker price of college tuition.<br />To break this vicious circle, the government needs to lower tuition costs by getting out of the credit market for student loans and developing a more cost-effective way for all Americans, regardless of income, to attend college. The government could promote community colleges and trade schools over the traditional university experience, for example. Then the discussion can begin on how to deal with existing student debt.</td>

      <td>From “Why I Didn’t ‘Just Bake the Cake’ ” by Masterpiece Cakeshop proprietor Jack Phillips for First Things, May 28:<br /><br />Where do we think artistic creativity comes from? . . . It’s water from the fountain of our soul. . . That’s why I say that I’ll serve any person, but I won’t communicate all messages. Serving people is merely about recognizing each individual as a person worthy of respect, made in the image of God. I’m not trying to force any person to see the world the way I do, or to embrace my beliefs about God and the Bible. If you want to reject Jesus and purchase a cupcake, go ahead. I’ll gladly sell you that cupcake, and a cup of coffee to go with it, maybe even engage in a conversation about our differences.<br />But asking me to draw on my creativity to communicate a message I believe is wrong? That’s asking me to stop being me. . . . To deny the deepest convictions of my heart, and pretend I haven’t learned the most difficult lessons of my life, or that they don’t matter. That’s not something any person has the right to ask of another. Or a command any government has the right to force one of its citizens to obey.</td>

      <td>Brazil’s economy has returned to pre-pandemic levels, lifted by the biggest stimulus in emerging markets and a return to normal activity by many Brazilians who have ignored scientists’ calls to remain in lockdown as Covid-19 rages across the country.<br />In data released Tuesday, the economy grew 1.2% from the fourth quarter, boosted by agricultural exports, taking Latin America’s biggest economy back to its size at the end of 2019 before the beginning of the pandemic. Economists had forecast growth of less than 1%.<br />“People were up and about, generating GDP, but at a cost to public health, as we saw from the Covid numbers,” said Alberto Ramos, an economist at Goldman Sachs. But much of the growth came from pent-up demand during the pandemic, he said, adding that the country is still struggling to diversify its economy away from commodities.<br />“We have to grow the hard way, which is through investment and productivity growth, and that’s a challenge for Brazil,” Mr. Ramos said.<br />As Brazilians fill shopping malls and bars, about 77 people are still dying from Covid-19 every hour in the country. More than 460,000 Brazilians have died from the disease so far.</td>

      <td>President Biden rejoined the World Health Organization as one of his first official acts, and his Administration has vowed to “strengthen and reform” it. That effort isn’t going well, as last week’s World Health Assembly shows.<br />The annual WHO confab started badly as China succeeded in blocking Taiwan’s participation—and embarrassing the U.S. in the process. The island democracy, which hoped to participate as an observer, has one of the world’s best records combatting Covid-19 and could spread its lessons to the world.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinkensaid last month that there is “no reasonable justification for Taiwan’s continued exclusion from this forum,” and the G-7 nations supported its participation. But China, which tries to block Taiwan from all international institutions, prevailed over the Western democracies.<br />Then on Friday the World Health Assembly voted to appoint Syria and Belarus to WHO’s executive board, which sets the governing body’s agenda and implements its policies. Video of the vote shows it proceeding with neither debate nor objections.<br />These board seats reward Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose regime has slaughtered its own people and bombed hospitals; and Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who hijacked a passenger aircraft last month to arrest a critic. Syria will be represented by Minister of Health Hassan Mohammad Al Ghabbash, who was sanctioned by the U.K. for sharing responsibility “for the Syrian regime’s violent repression against the civilian population.”</td>

      <td>Reports that two Iranian frigates may be steaming into the Atlantic toward Venezuela ought to concentrate minds in the Biden Administration. So much for Iranian goodwill amid President Biden’s determination to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal.<br />The vessels’ destination isn’t clear, and they could still turn back. But when asked by reporters on Monday about U.S. monitoring of the frigates, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said “Iran has constant presence in international waters, is entitled to this right on the basis of international law, and can be present in international waters.” He added: “I warn that nobody should make a miscalculation. Those who live in glass houses must be cautious.”<br />Iran’s navy isn’t the U.S. Sixth Fleet, but the entry of warships into Caribbean waters would be a notable provocation. If it sails into these waters without resistance, a precedent will be set for adversarial navies operating in the region. Don’t be surprised if Russia and China decide to join the party in the future.<br />Iran is a long-time Cuban ally, and since Hugo Chávez turned Venezuela into a dictatorship 20 years ago, Tehran has nurtured an ever-closer relationship with Caracas. The two regimes have engaged in joint defense ventures in the Venezuelan state of Aragua, and Venezuela is known to supply fake identities to Iranian operatives to move around the region.<br />Venezuela’s point man for Iran is Tareck El Aissami, now oil minister. Iran is an essential energy supplier for the South American basket case, where domestic gasoline production has collapsed amid a shortage of resources, maintenance failures and corruption.</td>

Mr. Pecker stepped down as CEO of American Media when it merged with Accelerate 360 LLC, a Georgia-based logistics and distribution business, last year.</td>

Mr. Musk paid $20 million to settle that case—Tesla also paid $20 million—and agreed to have his public statements on social media overseen by Tesla lawyers.<br />In correspondence sent to Tesla in 2019 and 2020, the SEC said tweets Mr. Musk wrote about Tesla’s solar roof production volumes and its stock price hadn’t undergone the required preapproval by Tesla’s lawyers. The communications, which haven’t been previously reported, spotlight the running tension between the nation’s top corporate regulator and Mr. Musk, who publicly mocked the SEC even after settling fraud claims with the agency.<br />The SEC told Tesla in May 2020 that the company had failed “to enforce these procedures and controls despite repeated violations by Mr. Musk.” The letter, signed by Steven Buchholz, a senior SEC official in its San Francisco office, added: “Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order.”<br />Tesla, Mr. Musk, and the SEC didn’t respond to requests for comment.</td>

Mr. Biden issued a “Day of Remembrance” proclamation on Monday, committing to honor the legacy of the Greenwood community.<br />The White House said Mr. Biden will meet privately with three survivors who were children at the time of the massacre: Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis and Lessie Benningfield Randle.<br />The new measures that Mr. Biden will describe, according to the White House, include increasing the share of federal contracts going to certain small, mostly minority- or women-owned businesses by 50% by 2026, which administration officials say would mean $100 billion more for such businesses. The Democratic administration is also expected to propose reversing steps taken by the Republican Trump administration to soften or revoke Obama-era regulations that cracked down on discrimination in housing.<br />Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge also will be charged with a new initiative that would seek to root out what the White House described as racial discrimination in the appraisal and home-buying process.</td>

In place of the podcast on the JAMA website is a recording of Dr. Bauchner apologizing for the discussion.<br />“Comments made in the podcast were inaccurate, offensive, and hurtful, and inconsistent with the standards of JAMA,” Dr. Bauchner said Tuesday. “Racism and structural racism exist in the United States, and in healthcare.”</td>

It has been off limits to drillers, miners and other developers for decades. Mr. Biden has sided with environmentalists who say the area should remain pristine, protected wilderness.</td>

The decision paves the way for a WHO-backed Covax vaccine pool to distribute doses. The moves are part of a renewed push by the United Nations to get more vaccines to the developing world to bring global contagion under control.<br />They came a day after the agency ended an annual meeting with some of its other efforts—such as research into the origins of the disease or a new treaty to stop future pandemics—snagged by disagreements between the U.S. and China.<br />Joined by leaders of the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund, WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus asked that wealthy countries donate $50 billion that he said would be enough to have 60% of the world-wide population covered within the next year. That, leaders of the four institutions said, would allow $9 trillion in new economic growth by 2025.<br />“It is now crucial to get these lifesaving tools to the people who need them quickly,” Dr. Tedros told reporters. “We have the means to end this pandemic quickly and save countless lives and livelihoods, but we need the will to make it happen.”</td>

      <td>While it is unfortunate that Mr. Reiners’ proposed ban mimics the Chinese approach, it is also technically impossible.</td>
      <td>Regarding Lee Reiners’s “Ban Cryptocurrency to Fight Ransomware” (op-ed, May 26): Emulating the Chinese government’s approach to cryptocurrencies is misguided, impractical and un-American. As Mr. Reiners concedes, “banning anything runs counter to the American ethos,” a statement that encapsulates the open approach to new technology that we, as a country, have often pursued. While it is unfortunate that Mr. Reiners’s proposed ban mimics the Chinese approach, it is also technically impossible. Open blockchain networks run on open-source software, meaning the government couldn’t enforce a ban on digital assets without shutting down the entire internet. We doubt such a solution would have much of a durable constituency on Capitol Hill or in the White House.<br />Indeed, what sort of signal would banning this censorship-resistant financial system send to the billions of people living under authoritarian regimes? One timely example undermines Mr. Reiners’s assertion that cryptocurrencies are used only by speculators and criminals. According to the Human Rights Foundation, Belarusians have used bitcoin to defy Alexander Lukashenko’s regime by sending more than $3 million in unstoppable money directly to striking workers, who then convert it to local currency in peer-to-peer marketplaces, helping to support protests against the country’s dictatorship.<br />Another more local example shouldn’t escape our view: Mr. Reiners’s Global Financial Markets Center openly solicited, until May 26, donations in several cryptocurrencies. If a well-regarded think tank focused on the future of the world’s financial systems deems crypto donations worthy, perhaps Mr. Reiners should look closer to home for worthwhile use cases.<br />Kristin Smith<br />Executive Director</td>

      <td>Justices’ unanimous ruling further affirms limited sovereignty for indigenous nations</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday that tribal police officers with sufficient cause can stop and search non-Indians traversing reservations, the latest in several recent decisions that in ways large and small have affirmed limited sovereignty for Native American nations.<br />Indian tribes have jurisdiction over Indians for crimes committed on reservations, but non-Indians typically fall under the authority of federal or state authorities. Reasoning that a non-Indian’s 2016 drug arrest in Montana stemmed from a tribal officer’s investigation, federal trial and appellate courts threw out the conviction.<br />Tuesday’s decision, however, found that tribes hold basic authority on reservations to safeguard the welfare of their members, including the legal power to make safety checks on suspicious cars stopped along the public right-of-way.<br />Tribes “lack inherent sovereign power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the court, or even to “regulate hunting and fishing by non-Indians on land that non-Indians own” on a reservation. Congress holds the ultimate power over tribal authority, the court has held.<br />But in decisions tracing to the republic’s early years, the Supreme Court has on occasion recognized the dependent sovereignty the tribes retained. Justice Breyer recalled an 1832 opinion by Chief Justice John Marshall affirming Cherokee prerogatives against encroachment from the state of Georgia.</td>

Discovery.<br />Discovery Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav announced the name during a town hall meeting Tuesday with WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar. Mr. Zaslav, who will lead Warner Bros. Discovery, added that the name is meant to evoke the company’s focus on storytelling, exemplified by the nearly century-old Warner Bros. studio.<br />Also during the town hall, Mr. Zaslav said the new company’s tagline will be “The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of,” a reference to the classic 1941 noir film “The Maltese Falcon” starring Humphrey Bogart and distributed by the Warner Bros. film studio. During one scene in the movie Mr. Bogart’s character, Sam Spade, refers to the titular Maltese Falcon statuette as “the stuff that dreams are made of,” a line that riffs on a similar one in Shakespeare’s “The Tempest.”<br />Mr. Zaslav said during the meeting that the company’s new name and tagline are intended to emphasize its heritage as a content company. Under AT&T’s leadership, WarnerMedia has sometimes faced internal division over the relationship between its business goals and its creative culture, The Wall Street Journal has reported.<br />Tuesday’s meeting was the first time the two executives made a joint appearance since Discovery and AT&T announced the deal in May. Mr. Kilar wasn’t involved in early-stage negotiations between AT&T and Discovery, leading to speculation that he might not have a substantial role during the two companies’ integration. But last week, Mr. Kilar told employees that he would stay until the merger is completed.</td>

      <td>The document predicts the economy stays stuck at 2% GDP growth for years. How come?</td>
      <td>President Biden’s proposed budget would represent a sea change in American fiscal policy. If enacted, outlays over the next decade would increase by about $8 trillion and revenues by $6 trillion, bringing the deficit to $14.5 trillion from $12.3 trillion projected under current policy. The share of the economy flowing to the federal government would rise to about one-quarter, up from one-fifth, and the budget deficit would average about 5% of gross domestic product. By 2031 national debt held by the public would stand at $39 trillion, a record 117% of GDP.<br />Despite soaring spending and debt, the Biden administration predicts that interest rates and inflation won’t increase more than current projections. This forecast may be rosy to the point of implausibility. Is it believable that a decade of Mr. Biden’s fiscal policies will leave the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes at a mere 2.8%, compared with the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline forecast of 3.4%?<br />The administration is betting the farm on its theory of the case. If the latest inflationary surge lasts longer than Mr. Biden’s economists (and the Federal Reserve) predict, monetary policy would have to tighten, threatening to slow economic growth. If inflation rises, so would interest payments on the rapidly expanding federal debt, forcing tough fiscal choices.<br />But commentators have mostly overlooked the biggest surprise, and core conundrum, of the president’s proposal: Despite trillions of dollars of additional expenditures—some of which are investments, others not—the projected rate of economic growth increases only modestly, and most of the bump comes in the early years before tapering off.<br />During the next two years, Mr. Biden’s spending surge would help return the economy to full employment faster than staying at the status quo. This is a good thing. But between the beginning of fiscal 2024 and the end of fiscal 2031, the administration’s projections show GDP rising by $8.9 trillion, barely distinguishable from the $8.8 trillion in CBO’s baseline.</td>

By using a mix of methods—including setting up internship arrangements that better suited the students’ strengths—the program saw strong results: Today, about 50% of its participants win summer internships, up from 5% at the start.<br />Break Through Tech is one of several recent efforts that are making headway against a longstanding problem: boosting the small number of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM. These programs attack the problem in a number of different ways. They are giving students enrichment programs, setting them up with female mentors as role models, grounding their course work in real-world problems to keep it relevant—and sometimes, like Break Through Tech, mediating with potential employers.<br />Beyond that, many of the programs are looking to change something even more fundamental—how girls are taught science and even how they view themselves.<br />“Our education system is simply not set up to close the gender gap in tech,” says Tarika Barrett, chief executive officer of the training and advocacy group Girls Who Code.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Huawei Technologies Co. on Wednesday launches its self-developed operating system for mobile phones, the company’s latest bid to break free of U.S. suppliers and an attempt to challenge Google’s dominance in smartphone software.<br />The Chinese tech giant plans to launch its new operating system, known as Harmony OS, across a large number of its smartphones during an online-only event, as well as unveil smart devices that will also run the company’s latest homemade software.<br />Huawei gadgets have been cut off from updating Google’s Android operating system since August, following a series of U.S. sanctions against the Shenzhen-based company. The ban also cost Huawei access to the U.S. company’s package of smartphone software known as Google Mobile Services, used widely across the industry.<br />While Huawei’s own smartphone sales are in free fall after briefly topping the world a year ago, the company is targeting other handset vendors that they hope will adopt Harmony OS, posing a direct challenge to Google Android’s dominance of the market.<br />Samsung  Electronics Co., Xiaomi Corp.  and the rest of the world’s top-selling phone makers besides  Apple Inc.  all use Google’s Android. Chinese sellers make up 57% of the global handset market, according to market-research firm Canalys and could be potential takers if Huawei’s Harmony OS develops into a worthy match.</td>

      <td>Eye doctors say they’re seeing more children with new or worsening vision problems. Increased screen time, they believe, bears part of the blame.</td>
      <td>Many kids are emerging from the pandemic with vision problems, doctors say. A primary culprit, they believe, is increased screen time.<br />Eye doctors say they are seeing more children—many of whom were in virtual school—with new and worsening prescriptions for myopia, or near-sightedness. Rates of myopia in children were already increasing globally before the pandemic, but some research suggests the past year has exacerbated the problem. Doctors also report more cases of digital eye strain in kids.<br />A leading theory behind rising myopia rates posits that when children look at screens or books for prolonged periods, the eye adjusts to accommodate a close focus, which may change and elongate the shape of the eye, leading to myopia. Likewise, decreased outdoor time may increase and worsen myopia, as people tend to look farther away when they’re outside. Natural light and physical activity outside may also play a role. (Adults don’t tend to experience significant worsening of myopia because eye growth generally stabilizes after childhood.)<br />“We know that focusing up close and not being outside has increased the rate of myopia,” says Julia A. Haller, the ophthalmologist-in-chief at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. “There’s been a huge impact from the pandemic,” she says.<br />In a January study in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology, researchers in China looked at myopia rates in more than 120,000 homebound children during the pandemic and found the prevalence in children ages 6 to 8 increased up to three times compared with the previous five years.</td>

Steve Daines (R., Mont.), who has criticized the Biden administration’s pause on federal oil and gas leasing and its decision to kill the Keystone XL pipeline project.<br />Mr. Daines applauded the administration’s recent federal court filing to defend ConocoPhillips’s Willow project against challenges from environmental groups.

Users would have to pay for usage.<br />The program could pay out a total of €100 million, according to the government minister in charge of the project, and could launch within weeks.<br />Broadband access in Germany is limited outside large cities—and sometimes within them—due to a low penetration of fiber-optic cables compared with other European countries. In international rankings, Germany often features behind less-developed nations. According to the Speedtest Global Index, Germany ranked 35th in April, behind Panama and Poland.<br />Mr. Musk’s Starlink has emerged as an early market leader, offering high-speed internet services beamed from one of its nearly 1,500 satellites directly to users on Earth. Starlink is currently offering its service across swaths of Germany and says that it will achieve broad coverage by the end of 2021.</td>

It is on track for its highest close since May 2019. West Texas Intermediate futures gained 2.8% at $68.18 a barrel. The U.S. gauge on Tuesday crossed its highest level since October 2018.<br />Prices are rallying after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’s technical committee on Monday confirmed forecasts for a rebound of six million barrels a day in world oil demand this year, according to people familiar with OPEC and its allies. Ministers from those countries are scheduled to meet with non-cartel allies Tuesday to discuss plans to further relax ongoing production curbs during June and July.<br />Vaccination programs are enabling governments across North America and Europe to reduce coronavirus restrictions and resume more normal economic activity. That will help pare global oil stocks—which at one point last year threatened to overwhelm the world’s ability to store them—to below their five-year average by the end of July for the 2015-19 period, the OPEC committee projected. In the U.S., oil and oil-product inventories have fallen more than expected in recent weeks.<br />Investors and analysts also expect the group known as OPEC+, an alliance between members of OPEC and other top oil producers, to stick to plans to further relax production curbs that have been in place since prices collapsed last spring.</td>

Far from a hobbled company in distress, Monmouth owns 120 industrial properties in 31 states. The sector is one of the most profitable because of high demand for fulfillment centers from e-commerce companies such as  Amazon.com Inc.<br />Mr. Zell also wasn’t able to drive as hard a bargain as he had in many previous distressed deals. The all-stock deal reached in May is valued at more than $18 a share, a near-record for Monmouth stock. He could conceivably have to pay even more, since Blackwells Capital, which made an $18-a-share all-cash bid late last year, said it is weighing options including a higher offer.<br />Mr. Zell declined to comment. But the 79 year-old’s more conventional investment strategy is the latest sign that the pandemic hasn’t produced the distressed opportunities many investors expected.</td>

With the dearth of homes for sale throughout the U.S. pushing up housing prices, single-family rentals have become an increasingly popular alternative to buying in desirable neighborhoods.<br />Goldman Sachs last week provided a $300 million credit facility to Fundrise, the startup said.

Apps such as Robinhood have turned thousands of younger and less wealthy people into busy stock traders, leading to hopes that some of them could be drawn to real estate, too.<br />Washington, D.C.-based Fundrise manages a so-called interval fund, in which individual investors can invest small sums without going through a broker, though they can only pull out their money at set intervals.<br />The fund has raised around $200 million since its January launch, and has bought or signed contracts to buy around 2,500 homes, said Fundrise Chief Executive Ben Miller.</td>

      <td>Many SPAC teams are wooing startups to finish deals within two years</td>
      <td>Competition among so-called blank-check companies to find mergers is already stiff. Share-price declines and a ticking clock to take companies public are ratcheting up the pressure.<br />The new challenges for creators of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, result in part from the abundance of the deals that raised money early in 2021. Looming over these firms is a two-year deadline to do a deal or hand back cash to investors.<br />Now that shares of many SPAC-related companies have fallen, fewer startups are interested in going public through a SPAC. That mismatch is intensifying competition between some blank-check firms for the same private firms, known by some on Wall Street as a “SPAC-off.”<br />SPACs are shell companies that raise money and list on an exchange with the sole intent of merging with a private firm to take it public. The private company, often a startup, then gets the SPAC’s place in the stock market. Blank-check mergers let companies going public make future business projections—which aren’t allowed in regular IPOs—one reason they took Wall Street by storm this winter and have raised a record $105 billion this year, according to SPAC Research.<br />But with SPAC shares in retreat, many blank-check firms now trade below their debut price. Many companies in recent months have said that several different SPACs have asked them about mergers, a trend that contributed to the frenzy in the sector.</td>

That’s my baby out there guarding LeBron,” said Tyneeha Rivers, his mother. “He was this skinny kid—and now look at him.”<br />The easiest way to spot Bridges during a Suns game is to search for the other team’s best player.

      <td>HONG KONG—The government Tuesday unveiled plans to require people in Hong Kong to provide their real name and other personal details when registering mobile phone numbers, a move that critics said would further curtail people’s freedoms and stoke fears of surveillance.<br />Officials said the change was necessary to aid investigations by law-enforcement agencies and would help tackle thefts by phone scammers preying on city residents, as well as drug trafficking and other organized crimes. It puts Hong Kong in line with about 155 countries including France, Germany and South Korea that have similar measures, officials have said. In the U.S., there is no federal law mandating people buying prepaid SIM cards to have their identities verified.<br />The proposal has touched a nerve in the Chinese territory, however, where fears of surveillance run high amid a continuing crackdown on dissent. Activists and opposition politicians have had phone messages used by police as evidence against them for alleged violations of the national security law imposed in June.<br />During antigovernment demonstrations that rocked the city in 2019, many protesters took steps to conceal their identities by using pseudonyms on messaging platforms and buying spare SIM cards for communication. Currently, while users who subscribe to SIM service plans from carriers do register their names, people can buy or top up prepaid SIM cards from convenience stores and other outlets without doing so.<br />“The Hong Kong government continues to make policies that show they don’t trust their own citizens,” said Lokman Tsui, an assistant professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He described the policy, which will see registrations begin next year, as a further erosion of privacy and trust in Hong Kong.</td>

      <td>Companies have spent more than a decade forcing employees and customers to resolve disputes outside the traditional court system, using secretive arbitration proceedings that typically don’t allow plaintiffs to team up and extract big-money payments akin to a class action.<br />Now,  Amazon . com Inc. is bucking that trend. With no announcement, the company recently changed its terms of service to allow customers to file lawsuits. Already, it faces at least three proposed class actions, including one brought May 18 alleging the company’s Alexa-powered Echo devices recorded people without permission.<br />The retail giant made the change after plaintiffs’ lawyers flooded Amazon with more than 75,000 individual arbitration demands on behalf of Echo users. That move triggered a bill for tens of millions of dollars in filing fees, according to lawyers involved, payable by Amazon under its own policies.<br />Amazon’s decision to drop its arbitration requirement is the starkest example yet of how companies are responding to plaintiffs’ lawyers pushing the arbitration system to its limits.<br />Arbitration agreements are buried in the contracts consumers sign to do everything from buying a cellphone to using a ride-hailing app. Many employers also require arbitration for adjudicating issues like pay disputes or discrimination claims. The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld and strengthened the rights of companies to mandate arbitration.</td>

      <td>The GOP drew voters who skipped prior elections, new data show, but lost some habitual voters</td>
      <td>New data on the 2020 election show that then-President Donald Trump drew substantial support in some battleground states from Americans who had skipped prior elections, creating a new pool of voters whose decisions on whether to participate again will be central to next year’s midterms.<br />These voters had cast ballots intermittently or sat out all prior elections, despite being old enough to vote, but were drawn off the sidelines by the Republican president’s race against his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. New analyses by TargetSmart, a Democratic voter-data firm, and the Republican National Committee found that more of these “low-propensity voters” chose to register as Republicans than Democrats in several of the closest battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida.<br />In Pennsylvania, for example, more than 600,000 voters who cast ballots in 2020 had been eligible to vote in prior general elections but never did, TargetSmart found. More of these newly engaged voters registered as Republicans than Democrats by about 6 percentage points, giving the GOP an edge of about 35,400 voters in a fiercely competitive state—though one which Mr. Biden won.<br />The results present both good news and a challenge for the Republican Party. The data help explain how Mr. Trump won 11 million more votes in 2020 than in his first election and show that his campaign drew new supporters to the GOP, an effort that focused most intensely on reaching working-class and rural voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and other battlegrounds.<br />But the strategy came with a gamble. In engaging more working-class and rural Americans, Mr. Trump forfeited a measure of support from professional-class and suburban voters in the process, losing people who show up regularly for elections in favor of those with inconsistent voting records. That has left Republicans with an increased reliance on voters who likely need an extra push to turn out again, analysts in both parties say.</td>

      <td>Airbnb shows that travel’s only ‘super app’ these days is the smaller one</td>
      <td>Two years ago, it seemed like  Airbnb  was bulking up to take on major global online travel agents such as  Booking Holdings  and  Expedia Group .  Then the pandemic hit, and it was forced to retrench. That might have been the better move all along.<br />Booking has been focused on building something of a “super app” for a connected trip that brings all facets of travel into one place. Before the pandemic, it seemed like homestay giant Airbnb was headed in a similar direction. It bought premium homestay platform Luxury Retreats, invested in a print-only travel magazine, a joint venture with Hearst Magazines, later bought hotel booking site Hotels Tonight and hired its first head of transportation.<br />But last May, much of that was put on the back burner as Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said the company was reducing its investment in activities that didn’t support the core of its host community, choosing to focus specifically on homeshare and experiences. It did this, according to Mr. Chesky, because it “could not afford everything” it once could.<br />Paring down, it seems, has been the key to Airbnb’s business outperformance. At its bottom last year, Booking saw its gross travel bookings decline by more than 90% year on year, while Airbnb’s fell 67%. As of the first quarter, bookings for the online travel agent were still down more than 50% from the same period in 2019; Wall Street is estimating they won’t return to pre-pandemic levels until the fourth quarter of 2022.<br />Airbnb, meanwhile, is already there. The company said bookings in the first quarter grew 3% from the same period of 2019. By the end of next year, analysts are forecasting that Airbnb will be enjoying year-over-year bookings growth of more than 47%. Its narrowed focus is a sustainable one.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Buffeted by rising costs, some Chinese manufacturers are refusing to accept new orders or are even considering shutting down operations temporarily—moves that could put more strain on global supply chains and cause more inflation.<br />Surging raw materials prices and a shortage of workers have pinched smaller Chinese manufacturers, including many that sell their products to the U.S. and other western markets. While many have passed their higher costs on to overseas buyers, the pain is so severe at some manufacturers that they are finding it hard to raise prices enough to make up the difference. Others don’t want to risk losing business to competitors. Many are now looking for other solutions to avoid losing money.<br />Zhongshan Xiliwang Electrical Appliances Co., a kitchen ventilator producer based in southern China, told clients in mid-May that it would stop accepting new orders temporarily and urged customers to wait for two weeks before negotiating prices, given their volatility.<br />The company has been operating at a loss since April, in part because of a substantial increase in prices for metals, glasses and switches, it said in its notice to buyers.<br />Xing Jialiang, the owner of a glass factory in Zhongshan, says his firm is also running out of good options. It has raised prices by about 5% so far this year, but that hasn’t been enough to keep up with a 10% increase in costs, he said. Mr. Xing said costs were pushed higher in part because Chinese authorities shut down or limited production at some high-polluting plants, including those in glass manufacturing, which is energy-intensive and emits large amounts of carbon dioxide. China has vowed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.</td>

The U.S. recorded just one child death related to the flu in the 2020-21 season, down from 199 the previous year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />What is less widely known—in part because the data are more scattered—is the long list of other viruses and bacteria that have found themselves shut out in the pandemic world.</td>

But at higher levels of rates, between 3.5% and 5%, stock and bond prices become more volatile and move in sync—so this ETF is meant to protect investors from that outcome too, Mr. Bassman said.</td>

      <td>The companies likely will have to continue selling huge numbers of shots, or find other illnesses for their technology to tackle, investors say</td>
      <td>Covid-19 vaccine-makers’ shares have soared since the beginning of 2020.  Moderna Inc.  is up about 850%, BioNTech SE has risen 510% and  Novavax Inc.  is up nearly 3,620%.<br />Each of these companies has produced vaccines that have won regulatory authorization or are expected to win that backing. Some of the vaccine makers are racking up huge revenues. Their valuations assume more big gains, which depend on the next stages of the pandemic and whether the companies’ vaccine technology can be used to treat other diseases.<br />Michael Yee, an analyst at Jefferies Group, expects Covid-19 vaccines to produce $20 billion of sales for Moderna this year and between $10 billion and $30 billion next year, for example. In May, the Cambridge, Mass.-based company said its Covid-19 vaccine was effective in children aged 12 to 17 in a new study. The Moderna shot would be the second for use in adolescents after the  Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine.<br />The big pharmaceutical companies that developed vaccines, such as  Johnson & Johnson ,  Pfizer Inc. and  AstraZeneca  PLC, haven’t had the share-price gains like the smaller companies. Even successful vaccines won’t boost these companies’ huge revenues much. Some of the companies have also promised to limit profit during the pandemic, and AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have struggled with production. Still the companies could benefit if long-term demand grows for their vaccines.<br />The high valuations for the smaller stocks are giving some analysts pause. The companies likely will have to continue selling huge numbers of these shots, or find new pathogens and illnesses for their technology to tackle, to drive their stock prices higher, some investors and analysts say. Moderna has a market value of more than $75 billion, for example. Its high stock price is why Mr. Yee has a hold rating on the stock, even though he is bullish on the company’s prospects.</td>

      <td>The effects of China’s demographic crisis will percolate to nearly every corner of the global economy</td>
      <td>China will allow couples to have three children and will invest more in education and child care, after decades of restricting most families to one or two children. The change is welcome, but the limited success of many other countries trying to boost births with financial incentives—and the lackluster response to a similar policy change in 2015—mean it is probably too late to head off the worst of China’s demographic crisis. The effects of the great Chinese baby bust will percolate to nearly every corner of the global economy.<br />One of the biggest effects could be on something that is very much already on companies’ minds these days: inflation.<br />Of course, a significantly smaller Chinese labor force wouldn’t necessarily mean higher prices for labor-intensive consumer goods. That would also depend on demand, levels of automation, transportation technologies and many other things. But all things being equal, it does seem likely that costs for labor-intensive manufacturing in aggregate could be set to rise significantly over the next decade or so, particularly if India continues to struggle with poor infrastructure and protectionism. Places like Vietnam will help, but the scale is several degrees of magnitude away. China’s Guangdong province alone is home to around 30% more people.<br />One reason China’s integration into the world economy had such an enormous impact on the price of labor-intensive goods was that it timed its opening to the world nearly exactly right demographically. From 1990 to 2010, the percentage of the nation’s population ages 15 to 64, already reasonably high, skyrocketed nearly 10 percentage points to 75%.<br />Not only was an enormous and cheap labor force suddenly available to multinational producers, but that labor force in aggregate had relatively few dependents to care for. Workers were more open to taking risks and chasing work opportunities far away in the big coastal cities.</td>

The exact terms couldn’t be learned, but the company has a market value of nearly $4 billion.<br />Founded in 2008 by a group of engineers from  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google, Facebook  Oracle Corp.  and Yahoo Inc., Cloudera was an early player in the open-source software framework Hadoop, which enables large amounts of data to be processed quickly. But it struggled to shift to the now-dominant public cloud, where it faces steep competition from much larger firms including  Amazon.com Inc.’s  Amazon Web Services.<br />Cloudera’s shares have had a rocky run since their public-market debut in 2017. They are trading below their initial public offering price and are down roughly 8% so far this year after closing Friday at $12.86.<br />Still, recent results have shown improvement in the company’s business. Cloudera in March reported revenue of $869 million for its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, an increase of 9%, and an operating margin of 17% compared with a negative one a year earlier.

Tehran accused Israel at the time of orchestrating the attack to undermine the start of talks in Vienna involving Iran and the U.S. aimed at restoring the 2015 nuclear deal. Former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal in 2018.<br />Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium increased by an estimated 273 kilograms in the three months ending May 22, the IAEA said, just over half the 525 kg stockpile increase in the previous quarter. The Natanz incident happened April 11, halfway through the reporting period.<br />The agency also reported that on May 24, there were 20 cascades of centrifuges working at the fuel enrichment plant at Natanz, a sharp decrease from before the April incident.</td>

      <td>Israel may get a new government, but don’t expect a left turn.</td>
      <td>Western democracies produce all manner of governments: Left- or right-wing, centrist, populist. But the new government taking shape in Israel defies categorization. If negotiations go through as planned, Israel could soon be led by a religious-nationalist Prime Minister backed by a centrist dealmaker, with the support of Arab and leftist parties.<br />American liberals will surely celebrate the departure of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has come to symbolize the Democratic Party’s rift with Israel over the last decade. But it would be a mistake to interpret it as a rejection of Israel’s rightward political and security direction, which the new government is likely to maintain.<br />The unusual coalition is coming together after Israelis went to the polls four times since 2019, most recently this March. Though his security policies had wide support, Mr. Netanyahu—who has been Prime Minister since 2009—was unable to form a majority coalition from among Israel’s 13 fractious parties.<br />The conventional wisdom this month said Hamas had given Mr. Netanyahu a new political lease on life by launching its rocket assault on Israel, elevating the security issue that built Mr. Netanyahu’s career. Yet a week after the fighting stopped, Naftali Bennett of the conservative Yamina party announced that he would accept an offer from the centrist Yair Lapid to form a government without Mr. Netanyahu. Under the agreement, Mr. Bennett will be Prime Minister immediately, with Mr. Lapid taking over in 2023, if the government lasts that long.<br />Mr. Bennett served as Mr. Netanyahu’s chief of staff in the 2000s and has since largely criticized him from the right. He is a longtime champion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, explicitly rejects a two-state solution and has urged tougher military action against the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. Territorial concessions with a government that depends on his support would be impossible.</td>

      <td>Joe Biden says it’s ‘an assault on democracy.’ The facts say otherwise.</td>
      <td>As the Texas legislative session drew near its end Sunday, lawmakers appeared set to pass a bill overhauling the state’s elections, until Democrats did one final maneuver: They snuck out of the building. “Members, take your key and leave the chamber discreetly,” a Democratic leader in the state House told his caucus in a 10:35 p.m. text message.<br />The extraordinary move deprived the House of a quorum, killing the bill for now, at the cost of undermining the legislative process. But what do you expect after months of Democratic alarms about “voter suppression”? President Biden on Saturday called the Texas plan “un-American” and “part of an assault on democracy.” At least this time he didn’t say it’s worse than Jim Crow, which was the political bomb he lobbed at Georgia’s bill.<br />The reality is more prosaic. To start with the controversial, the 67-page bill would roll back Covid-19 innovations like Harris County’s drive-through voting and 24-hour voting. Those options were used disproportionately last year by black and Hispanic residents. But when did emergency procedures amid a 100-year pandemic suddenly become the new baseline? It’s hardly crazy to think polling-place shenanigans might be more likely at 3 a.m.<br />The bill says that on the last Sunday of early voting, polling places may not open until 1 p.m. This is a political mistake, at minimum, in that it’s being spun as an attack on black churches that have a “souls to the polls” tradition. One lawmaker supporting the bill argued: “Those election workers want to go to church, too.” But some people take care of their religious obligations on Saturdays, and in any event Texas repealed most of its blue laws in 1985. Lawmakers would be wise to drop this provision.<br />Under the bill, Texas would still offer some two weeks of early voting. Mr. Biden’s beloved Delaware won’t have any early voting until 2022, when it will get 10 days. The Texas bill would also raise minimum hours. In the final week, counties with 100,000 people must currently open their “main” polling place 12 hours on weekdays and five hours on Sunday. That population threshold would drop to 30,000, and six hours would be mandated on Sunday.</td>

      <td>The State Department is supposed to advance U.S. interests and burnish the country’s image abroad.</td>
      <td>American diplomats take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. A foreign-service officer’s job is to advance American interests. But officials are now asking diplomats to function as social-justice warriors to the detriment of the country’s image abroad, as revealed by a leaked State Department cable encouraging embassies and consulates to fly Black Lives Matter flags.<br />Nearly 20 years ago, when I was sworn in as a foreign-service officer by Secretary of State Colin Powell, he said: “The most important of all the jobs that we are sending you out to do is to take with you the value system of the American people.” BLM’s values are shared by only half the country, if that, according to a recent USA Today/Ipsos poll. Another USA Today survey indicated that only 18% of Americans and 28% of blacks support the group’s signature goal, defunding the police.<br />Yet from reading the State Department’s May 21 cable, you’d think the country is in lockstep agreement. The cable asserts that protests in the wake of George Floyd’s killing “sparked a movement to confront systems perpetuating deep-seated inequities rooted in colonialism and the oppression of racial, tribal, ethnic, and other minority communities.” It continues: “Mr. Floyd’s murder prompted an international outcry to seek racial justice and equity by dismantling systemic racism and eradicating police brutality affecting communities of color, most acutely, people of African descent.” The missive asserted that federal law allows diplomats to “engage in BLM-related activity while on duty or in the workplace” but not to combine such advocacy with “political activity.”<br />That’s doublespeak. BLM activity is political advocacy. The group’s co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors is a self-described Marxist. Until recently, BLM’s website called on “comrades” to make efforts at “dismantling cisgender privilege and heteronormative thinking” and “disrupting the Western prescribed nuclear family structure requirement.”<br />The site still claims that “police were born out of slave patrols” and features a list of “demands” that include defunding police, barring Donald Trump from holding office or using social media, and “expelling” more than half of the Republicans in Congress for stoking “Trump’s conspiracy theories and encouraging the white supremacists to take action to overturn the election.”</td>

      <td>Biden wisely changes his position on an accord Russia openly violated.</td>
      <td>Much could go wrong when President Biden sits down with Vladimir Putin in Geneva on June 16. But at least one bad policy has been ruled out: The U.S. won’t try to revive the Open Skies Treaty.<br />“In concluding its review of the treaty, the United States therefore does not intend to seek to rejoin it, given Russia’s failure to take any actions to return to compliance,” a State Department statement said last week. “Further, Russia’s behavior, including its recent actions with respect to Ukraine, is not that of a partner committed to confidence-building.”<br />The 1992 accord—which allowed the U.S., Russia and European states to conduct surveillance flights over each other—is a relic of the optimism that accompanied the downfall of the Soviet Union. The treaty was theoretically useful in creating military transparency. But these kinds of agreements only work when the parties operate in good faith.<br />Despite some post-Cold War hope, Russia never transformed into a responsible international player. It blocked legitimate Western flights over its territory while using the treaty to gain intelligence about American sites. Even if Mr. Putin fully complied, the treaty still tilted in his favor: American surveillance technology outpaces Russian abilities, making the flights more useful to Moscow than Washington.<br />When Donald Trump announced he would leave the treaty in May 2020, Mr. Biden called the decision a “short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning American leadership.” He warned this would “increase the risks of miscalculation and conflict” while alienating Europeans who wanted the U.S. to stay.</td>

      <td>It isn’t awareness the West lacks but a clear strategy to reverse the rising, bloody tide.</td>
      <td>It’s been a big week for genocide apologies. On Friday, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas asked Namibia and the descendants of its Herero and Nama peoples to forgive Germany for actions that “from today’s perspective” were a “genocide.” After bloodily crushing a revolt against colonial rule, in the 1900s German authorities confined Herero and Nama in concentration camps, where a majority of inmates are believed to have died of starvation and illness. In many cases, the tribal land Germany confiscated—the taking of which triggered the rebellion—is still held by settlers’ descendants today. Berlin’s apology came with a pledge of €1.1 billion (around $1.3 billion) for development and reconstruction projects over the next 30 years as recompense.<br />Meanwhile in Rwanda Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged France’s “terrible responsibility” in the 1994 genocide, but without offering a formal apology or financial compensation. French forces played no direct role in the attacks that killed hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, but as Mr. Macron acknowledged, they supported the “genocidal regime” that carried out the murders. A French inquiry acknowledged in March what had been well-known to observers for decades: “French officials armed, advised, trained, equipped, and protected” the Rwandan government that prepared and carried out one of the most horrific actions by any non-Communist government since World War II.<br />The apologizers, as usual, seem less enthusiastic at their tasks than the genocidaires were in theirs. A representative of the Herero people denounced the German apology and compensation offer as “a total insult to our intelligence” and vowed to “fight to hell and back” against closing the books on the German colonial atrocities. The leading Rwandan genocide survivor group expressed disappointment that Macron didn’t offer “a clear apology.”<br />The problem for apologetic states in part is a legal one. Germans don’t want to set a precedent in Namibia that would strengthen the case of, for example, Greeks who demand close to €300 billion as compensation for Nazi crimes in World War II. Similar concerns have dogged Japan’s efforts to resolve the issue of crimes against Koreans during the era of colonial rule, which ended in 1945. Apologies carefully vetted by lawyers rarely sound truly heartfelt.<br />But if genocide apologizers are having an active year, genocidaires are even busier. Walking through my neighborhood in Washington earlier this spring I saw a crowd of people shouting “Stop the Genocide!” and it took me a few minutes to figure which contemporary atrocity they had in mind.</td>

      <td>New York<br />Nearly 30 people were shot in New York City on a single weekend in May. Citywide, shootings are up approximately 80% since the beginning of the year, and murders have increased more than 20%.<br />It is naive to think we can make the city safer by removing resources from the New York Police City Department. But it’s also true we can’t continue the current approach to fighting crime. Increasing police presence in high-crime areas is a critical component of responding to the violence affecting our city, but it is not a complete solution. We must confront this crime wave with specialized policing while also addressing the underlying social inequalities.<br />Some of my opponents in the race for mayor suggest a return to blunt-force tactics, such as stop-and-frisk, that perpetuated racial discrimination and stereotypes. In 2011, the peak of stop-and-frisk, police made 685,724 stops. Of those stopped, 87% were black or Latino, and 88% were innocent, according to an analysis of NYPD data from the New York Civil Liberties Union. The police are supposed to protect communities, not profile them.<br />Instead, the NYPD’s acute intelligence and investigative capabilities, which have resulted in record gun arrests—a 64% increase in February compared with the same time last year—should continue in communities facing runaway gun violence. We must also disrupt the influx of illegal guns and embed specially trained officers in the highest-crime areas to take on criminal networks.</td>

      <td>A series of evolutionary ‘trade offs’ means that even healthy bodies operate at the edge of acceptable performance, predictably prone to fail.</td>
      <td>In Voltaire’s “Candide,” the protagonist’s servant asks his master to explain the meaning of optimism. To which his master replies: “It is the mania for insisting that all is well when all is by no means well.” There is perhaps no more perfect description of the human condition, as all is manifestly not well. How could it be? From the moment of our inception, a silent biological clock begins the countdown to the end of our existence. Our genome contrives to mutate itself into a smorgasbord of potential pathologies, each capable of corrupting and unraveling us. We respond with attempts to medicate and therapize ourselves, to correct the built-in flaws and shining imperfections that make us so irresistibly human.<br />In Alex Bezzerides’s entertaining “Evolution Gone Wrong: The Curious Reasons Why Our Bodies Work (or Don’t),” the author’s quest is to determine the origins of the “aches and pains of the masses and why they happen”—not the mechanical causes of our maladies but the evolutionary ones. The explanation, Mr. Bezzerides concludes, may be found in our anatomical shortcomings—“trade-offs” made during our continuing evolutionary history. The result is that even healthy bodies operate at the edge of acceptable performance, while also being prone to fail in predictable ways.<br />The catalog of human fallibilities that Mr. Bezzerides assembles begins with an account of our suboptimal dentition. For many individuals, the textbook display of 32 neatly arrayed teeth, systematically configured to produce a perfect Hollywood smile, is at best hopeful and more frequently fictional. Reality more typically involves a procession of braces, extractions and eccentric protrusions. So why don’t our teeth fit into our mouths?<br />The answer, according to Mr. Bezzerides, is that four million years ago our ancestors transitioned from a fruit- and leaves-based diet to one of grasses and sedges. Their molars ballooned out to gargantuan proportions, which was not at first problematic, since their substantive jaws readily accommodated the newly enlarged teeth. But as humans controlled fire, learned to cook, became cooperative, and developed hunting techniques and an accompanying armamentarium of cutting implements, the requirement for robust dentition diminished. We were nevertheless stuck with the legacy of “a mouth full of large teeth.” Jaw and tooth size subsequently began to decrease, yet the distinct genetic programs controlling each led to a disconnect between their relative rates of reduction. While the human jaw enthusiastically embraced its “great shrink,” tooth-size reduction struggled to keep up. Hence the modern tooth-jaw mismatch.<br />Our imperfectly functioning eyes suffer similarly from constraints imposed by our distant evolutionary history. More than half of European adults have visual defects, while a quarter of U.S. children require visual correction. The problem, according to Mr. Bezzerides, is that the eyes of our vertebrate ancestors evolved to function underwater. When vertebrates first moved onto land 375 million years ago, their eyes had already existed for more than 100 million years. The reconfiguration of such established biological hardware was not trivial, leaving us with short-sightedness and a range of oddities, including the need to blink up to 14,000 times a day while deploying a Coke can full of lubricating tears.</td>

In her exit, she revealed a long-running struggle with depression and cast doubt on the rest of her season.<br />Osaka had already been fined $15,000 by the Roland-Garros organizers for failing to appear in a mandatory news conference after her first-round victory here on Sunday. (She still answered three questions on the court and honored a long-standing agreement with a Japanese broadcaster.)<br />“I never wanted to be a distraction and I accept that my timing was not ideal and my message could have been clearer,” she wrote in a statement posted to her social media accounts. “More importantly I would never trivialize mental health or use the term lightly. The truth is that I have suffered long bouts of depression since the U.S. Open in 2018 and I have had a really hard time coping with that.”<br />Osaka, who was raised primarily in the U.S. and represents Japan, had stunned the French Open shortly after landing in Paris when she informed organizers that she would not be carrying out her media duties during the tournament, because she “often felt that people have no regard for athletes’ mental health.”</td>

      <td>Eye doctors say they’re seeing more children with new or worsening vision problems. Increased screen time, they believe, bears part of the blame.</td>
      <td>Many kids are emerging from the pandemic with vision problems, doctors say. A primary culprit, they believe, is increased screen time.<br />Eye doctors say they are seeing more children—many of whom were in virtual school—with new and worsening prescriptions for myopia, or near-sightedness. Rates of myopia in children were already increasing globally before the pandemic, but some research suggests the past year has exacerbated the problem. Doctors also report more cases of digital eye strain in kids.<br />A leading theory behind rising myopia rates posits that when children look at screens or books for prolonged periods, the eye adjusts to accommodate a close focus, which may change and elongate the shape of the eye, leading to myopia. Likewise, decreased outdoor time may increase and worsen myopia, as people tend to look farther away when they’re outside. Natural light and physical activity outside may also play a role. (Adults don’t tend to experience significant worsening of myopia because eye growth generally stabilizes after childhood.)<br />“We know that focusing up close and not being outside has increased the rate of myopia,” says Julia A. Haller, the ophthalmologist-in-chief at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. “There’s been a huge impact from the pandemic,” she says.<br />In a January study in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology, researchers in China looked at myopia rates in more than 120,000 homebound children during the pandemic and found the prevalence in children ages 6 to 8 increased up to three times compared with the previous five years.</td>

The Covid-19 pandemic meant most theaters were closed and people were sheltered at home watching shows and movies on their televisions and devices. While the weekend’s total represents a significant rebound, domestic ticket sales for all movies during the Memorial Day holiday pre-Covid have tended to surpass $200 million.<br />Still, with the highest-grossing weekend in more than a year, “A Quiet Place Part II” did what avid moviegoers and Hollywood power players hoped it would: demonstrate that moviegoing—a business which has survived past existential threats like the advent of television and then home video—remains a resilient industry despite consumers’ increased adoption of streaming services.<br />Distributed by  ViacomCBS Inc.’s  Paramount Pictures movie studio, “A Quiet Place Part II” picks up where the original, 2018 breakout box-office hit left off, following members of a small family as they navigate a post-apocalyptic world where survivors seek shelter from deadly monsters that have a keen sense of hearing. Actors Emily Blunt and John Krasinski both reprise their roles. Mr. Krasinski, who has surprised fans at some early screenings to drum up interest in the film, also wrote, directed and produced the movie.</td>

Maybe that’s a good thing because we’ll have to overcome them together,” said Mr. Lapid Monday of the coalition talks. “In a week the state of Israel can be in a new era.”<br />Under the emerging terms of a deal, Mr. Bennett will serve first as prime minister for two years and then Mr. Lapid will succeed him. The other parties that are expected to be part of the government are left-wing Labor and Meretz, centrist Blue and White and right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu and New Hope as well as Mr. Lapid’s centrist Yesh Atid and Mr. Bennett’s right-wing Yamina. Israel’s Islamist party Raam is expected to back the coalition from the outside.<br />Mr. Lapid received the mandate to form the government earlier this month after Mr. Netanyahu failed. He has until Wednesday to tell Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin he is forming a government. Once he does that, the new government must be sworn in within a week, with the support of a majority of the Knesset.</td>

      <td>In pioneering test, insects with a gene primed to interrupt breeding are flying in the Florida Keys</td>
      <td><br />Across the Florida Keys this week, newly hatched mosquitoes are swarming from damp flowerpots, waterlogged spare tires, trash cans and drainage ditches. In six neighborhoods, however, a change is buzzing in the air. Scientists have genetically modified thousands of these mosquitoes and, for the first time in the U.S., set them free to breed.<br />These genetically engineered insects, known by their model number as OX5034, are a laboratory offshoot of the Aedes aegypti mosquito that transmits dengue, Zika and other infectious ills. After a decade of public debate and regulatory delays, these insects are being released by a U.K. biotechnology company called Oxitec.<br />Using genetic-engineering techniques, the company altered the male mosquitoes to pass down a gene that makes females need a dash of the antibiotic tetracycline to survive. Without it, females that spread the disease die as larvae. Altered males, which don’t bite, seek out wild females to mate and spread the lethal trait to future generations. Gradually, more females die. The swarms dwindle and disappear, with no need for chemical insecticides.<br />The Florida Keys field trial is a key step toward federal product approval for the altered insects from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which granted the company an experimental use permit for the test. “This is a big deal,” says molecular biologist Anthony James at the University of California, Irvine, who develops bioengineered mosquitoes but is not involved in the project.</td>

      <td>Fear of kidnapping closes campuses in Africa’s most populous nation, leaving millions out of school; ‘This has become our new normal’</td>
      <td>Gunmen kidnapped more than 100 students from an Islamic school in Nigeria on Sunday, local officials said, the latest in a rising tide of high-school abductions across Africa’s most populous nation, where kidnapping schoolchildren for ransom has become a lucrative industry.<br />Authorities in Niger state confirmed that armed men traveling on around 70 motorcycles arrived at the Salihu Tanko School in the town of Tegina Sunday afternoon and began shooting, before forcing the students to walk toward the forest at gunpoint. At least one person was killed, the officials said. One teacher estimated that 150 students were missing, while other reports put the figure at closer to 200. Later on Sunday, 11 children between 4 and 6 years old were recovered by authorities and said the gunmen released them because they were unable to keep walking and were slowing the convoy down.<br />“We were driving towards the school at the time of the kidnap but had to turn back because there was too much gunfire…We thought we’d get shot,” said Mohammed Idris, an eyewitness from Tegina.<br />Local officials said on Monday they were driving from house to house to try to ascertain the number of missing.<br />The kidnap-for-ransom business is booming across northern Nigeria, and schoolchildren are its hottest commodity.</td>

      <td>The star forward’s contract has allowed Colorado’s front office to build a deep bench around him for this year’s Stanley Cup run</td>
      <td>In the opening rounds of the NHL playoffs, the hottest player on the hottest team has been Colorado’s Nathan MacKinnon. Already one of the league’s top scorers over the last four seasons, the 24-year-old center has taken his game to another level in May and is racking up points at the most efficient clip of any skater in the 2021 postseason.<br />MacKinnon was key to Colorado’s opening round sweep of the St. Louis Blues and added another three points in Sunday’s 7-1 blowout of Las Vegas in Game 1 of the West Division final.<br />But it’s not just his scoring prowess that is propelling the Avalanche. He is also helping Colorado challenge for its first championship since 2001 with his contract. As the 79th highest-paid player in 2021, MacKinnon is the biggest bargain in professional hockey, allowing Colorado’s front office to build a deep bench around him for this year’s Cup run.<br />How it happened is partly a reflection of the NHL’s changing labor market dynamics and partly luck.<br />MacKinnon was the top pick in the 2013 NHL draft at 17 years old, won the Calder Trophy, awarded to the NHL’s rookie of the year, in 2013-14 and showed flashes of brilliance in subsequent seasons. As a sophomore he netted 38 points in 64 games and added 52 more in 72 contests heading into his contract year.</td>

      <td>It’s impossible to know if Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara has become yet another victim of psychiatric torture by the Cuban military dictatorship. But it sure looks that way. The 33-year-old artist has been held incommunicado at Havana’s Calixto Garcia Hospital since May 2.<br />A short, edited video of Mr. Otero Alcántara, released by regime surrogates via social media on May 20, has alarmed friends, supporters and the human-rights community. Amnesty International has declared him a prisoner of conscience. On Wednesday the New York Review of Books ran an open letter from more than 30 artists and writers across the globe demanding his release.<br />Don’t bet on it. This poor Afro-Cuban, armed only with his courage, intellect and creativity, is an existential threat to Cuba’s ruling elite.<br />Mr. Otero Alcántara is a founder of the San Isidro Movement, a collection of Cuban artists, writers, musicians, students and researchers formed in 2018 to oppose regime censorship. He was on a hunger strike to protest state confiscation of his artwork when police carted him off. They wanted to put an end to the public spectacle of his deteriorating physical condition.<br />The dictatorship also may have thought that by “hospitalizing” Mr. Otero Alcántara it would gag the movement—and maybe even get rid of him. (He’s in the same hospital where Ladies in White leader Laura Pollán died in 2011 at the height of her effectiveness as a regime critic.) But rising international criticism suggests the strategy could backfire.</td>

      <td>Torrance, Calif.<br />Crazy California laws occasionally go national. Take SB 132, which took effect in January. It allows transgender-identified male state prison inmates to transfer into women’s prisons based on “individual preference”—no hormones, surgery or time spent living as the opposite sex required. Spokeswoman Terry Thornton of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says 264 male prisoners have declared a nonmale identity and formally requested transfer to women’s facilities.<br />If Congress passes the Equality Act—the House already has—incarcerated biological men who identify as female would be entitled to transfer into women’s federal prisons and possibly also state prisons nationwide. How’s that working in California?<br />Not well, according to Amie Ichikawa, who was released in 2013 from the Central California Women’s Facility in Chowchilla, where she served five years for assault and kidnapping. Ms. Ichikawa is now forming a nonprofit to help currently incarcerated women. I visited her home in Torrance, and she put me in touch with four other current and former inmates. She contacted me after I appeared at a March Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to testify against the Equality Act. I told the lawmakers that although the vast majority of transgender Americans are peaceful, decent and law-abiding, the overbroad bill would be subject to abuse by opportunistic male felons.<br />None of the currently and formerly incarcerated women I spoke to expressed any animus toward transgender people. All acknowledged that some biological men who are transgender have been subject to abuse in men’s prisons. Several of the women made a point of saying they’d have no problem sharing a cell with natal males who have undergone sex-reassignment surgery.</td>

If the plaintiffs, Students for Fair Admissions, win, you can bet that elite college- and graduate-admissions offices around the country will establish workarounds to assure that opportunities remain for admittance of significant numbers of underrepresented minorities. And they’d be right to do so.<br />Expect opaque and unmeasurable admissions criteria to replace objective and rigorous standardized testing such as the SAT and ACT. These tests have their warts, no doubt, but they are more relevant than ever to help select the worthiest candidates, given vastly different educational experiences and rampant grade inflation. The tests have been shown to significantly predict first-year grades in universities at least as well for underrepresented minorities as for others. And recognizing the tests’ disparate socio-economic impact, admissions offices by and large have done an admirable job of using the tests flexibly and equitably, permitting more leeway for applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. This approach has been a lifeline for minority students. Do we really want to jettison it?<br />California, which has an anti-affirmative-action constitutional provision perpetually in the bull’s-eye of activists, has done just that. The UC Board of Regents voted last year to eliminate SAT/ACT requirements for new students. How the UC system will competently and fairly sift through the thousands and thousands of applicants—including making comparisons between minority candidates—in the absence of objective criteria like these tests is anyone’s guess.<br />Let’s not repeat that fiasco in waiting nationally. The justices would be wise to take a pass on the Harvard case, or to affirm the lower courts’ decisions.<br />William G. Lawlor</td>

True, but irrelevant.

It’s impossible to build green machines if someone else doesn’t dig. As for the International Energy Agency’s claim that my summary was “erroneous and incomplete,” they don’t dispute facts (I used their data), offering instead my failure to list their “six key” policy “actions” that would “ensure” the world will have enough minerals. Those “actions” are just aspirations, including: an “overarching international framework for dialogue and policy coordination among producers and consumers,” “stepping up R&D efforts,” the need to “explore a range of measures to improve the resilience of supply chains” and ensuring an “adequate investment in diversified sources of new supply.” The U.S. won’t be one of those sources.<br />That IEA report observed that if miners “wait for deficits to emerge before committing to new projects, this could lead to a prolonged period of market tightness and price volatility.” Translation: high prices and supply shortages for consumers and importers of minerals, especially the U.S.<br />Mark Mills<br />Chevy Chase, Md.</td>

Yet the absurdity of now throwing $54 billion of taxpayers’ money at an allegedly on-the-ropes U.S. semiconductor industry runs more deeply than you had space to mention.<br />It’s true, as you note, that “American companies dominate in design (52%) and chip-making equipment (50%).” But the good news about this industry doesn’t stop there. Consider this recent summary, by the Cato Institute’s Scott Lincicome, of the healthy state of America’s semiconductor industry: “The United States is also a top-five global exporter of semiconductors and related equipment, shipping almost $47 billion of those goods in 2019. These and other data led the SIA [Semiconductor Industry of America] to conclude in its 2020 State of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry report that ‘the semiconductor manufacturing base in the United States remains on solid footing.’”<br />“The SIA also reports that the U.S. industry has ‘nearly half’ of all global semiconductor sales—a market share that has been steady (ranging from the mid‐40s to low 50s) since the late 1990s—and is the top seller in every major regional market, including China. Sales by U.S. semiconductor firms also grew from $76.7 billion in 1999 to $192.8 billion in 2019—a compound annual growth rate of almost 5%.”<br />“Beyond output and sales, the U.S. semiconductor industry has been a global leader in capital spending (capex) and R&D.”<br />Subsidies are always suspect, but when showered on industries that are thriving, they are beyond doubt inexcusable. What further proof do we need to conclude that politicians cannot be trusted to allocate resources wisely?</td>

      <td>Shift comes as Beijing struggles to reverse a worsening demographic situation</td>
      <td>China no longer has a “one-child policy,” but it still keeps a lid on births.  Beijing on Monday said it would allow all couples to have up to three children, another gradual lifting of its birth restrictions as the number of babies born continues to shrink and the population ages. Here is the background.<br />In 1980, amid concerns the population was ballooning too quickly, China formally implemented a policy stipulating that most couples could only have one child. The policy was in place for more than three decades and was enforced by a massive family-planning bureaucracy. After some gradual loosening, Beijing said in late 2015 that it would allow all couples to have two children. This week, it increased the number to three<br />Chinese leaders have credited the policy with reining in explosive population growth, helping to lift the country out of poverty and limit its carbon emissions. Some economists and demographers say the effect on birthrates may have happened anyway as China grew wealthier. The policy’s lasting legacy is a mind-set where one child is the norm. Many couples now feel that they can’t afford two children, let alone three.<br />Beijing had projected that the move would lead to a sustained rise in births, but that hasn’t happened. In 2016, the first year of the two-child policy, births rose, but every year since has seen a drop. In 2020, there were around 12 million births, compared with 14.65 million the year before and 17.86 million in 2016.<br />In recent years, there are signs that authorities in parts of China have looked the other way when couples have three children, but fines and other consequences can still be meted out for “violating birth policies.” The rules are more strictly implemented for public-sector workers, who can face dismissal if they have more than the allowed number of children.</td>
