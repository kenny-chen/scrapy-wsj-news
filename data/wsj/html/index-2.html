      <td>Two courts block Biden’s SBA from passing out benefits by race.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration’s effort to distribute federal benefits by race is already running into legal trouble. Two rulings last week sided with plaintiffs who sued the Small Business Administration for violating equal treatment under the law.<br />At issue is the SBA requirement that only applications for restaurant relief from women and racial minorities will be processed in the first 21 days, sending everyone else to the back of the line. As the courts recognized, the danger is that the SBA will run out of funds before these other applications can be considered.<br />A federal judge in Texas ruled that the SBA’s Restaurant Revitalization Fund was wrong to distribute $28.6 billion in Covid-19 relief on the basis of an owner’s sex and race. Plaintiffs Jason and Janice Smith’s restaurant Blessed Cajuns lost nearly $350,000 in gross revenue due to Covid-19. Eric Nyman’s restaurant lost $800,000 during the pandemic.<br />America First Legal, which represents them, notes they are eligible for the relief but not for the SBA’s priority-group status. Federal Judge Reed O’Connor granted a preliminary injunction on grounds the restaurateurs are “experiencing race and sex discrimination at the hand of government officials.”<br />Meanwhile, in Vitolo v. Guzman the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a preliminary injunction against the SBA on behalf of white plaintiff Antonio Vitolo, half-owner of Jake’s Bar and Grill in Tennessee. The other half is owned by his wife, a Latina. In a 2-1 decision joined by Judge Alan Norris, Judge Amul Thapar cites Supreme Court precedents such as Adarand and Richmond v. Croson to eviscerate the SBA’s discriminatory logic.</td>

      <td>The Disney star and singer-songwriter hits No. 1 with debut in the biggest week for an album so far this year</td>
      <td>Olivia Rodrigo has stormed the charts—hitting No. 1 with huge streaming numbers for an album that clinches her status as one of music’s biggest new stars.<br />The Disney actress and pop singer-songwriter’s debut album “Sour” tops the latest Billboard 200 chart, generating the equivalent of 295,000 in U.S. sales in the week ended May 27. It is the biggest week for a debut charting album since late 2014, when Billboard began including streaming in its flagship album-sales chart, the magazine said.<br />Much of the 18-year-old artist’s units—218,000—came from her album’s massive 301 million first-week U.S. streams, according to MRC Data, formerly known as Nielsen Music. That is the second-biggest streaming week ever for an album by a woman, second only to Ariana Grande’s 307 million first-week streams for “Thank U, Next” in 2019. The rest of Ms. Rodrigo’s units came from traditional sales. (For Billboard, 1,250 streams by paying streaming-service subscribers, or 3,750 streams on free services like YouTube or Spotify’s ad-supported option, equals one album sale.)<br />Ms. Rodrigo’s No. 1 debut is the biggest week for an album so far this year, beating Taylor Swift’s rerecorded 2008 album “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),” which moved 291,000 units in its opening week. “Sour,” which Ms. Rodrigo released on May 21, features “Drivers License,” the year’s biggest hit, with roughly 800 million streams on Spotify alone, and “Good 4 U”—both of which topped Billboard’s Hot 100 singles chart. With a blockbuster debut record, two No. 1 singles and a recent performance on “Saturday Night Live,” Ms. Rodrigo has successfully leveraged her fame from “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” into pop stardom.<br />She’s “the biggest breakout pop star of 2021 by far,” Chris DeVille, senior editor at the website Stereogum, wrote this month.</td>

      <td>ISMAILIA, Egypt—Egyptian officials made their most specific allegations against the captain of a container ship that blocked the Suez Canal for nearly a week in March, accusing the skipper of losing control of the Ever Given and hitting the vital waterway’s bank.<br />The ship swerved left and right before becoming lodged in the bank of the canal, said Sayed Sheisha, the chief investigator for the Suez Canal Authority. “The captain issued eight commands within 12 minutes as he tried to bring the ship back into alignment.”<br />The question of who is to blame for the accident is at the heart of a dispute over how much compensation the ship’s owners should pay. Egyptian authorities seized the ship in April and are now demanding $550 million to cover for lost revenues, damage to the canal, and the cost of rescuing the ship.<br />The Japanese company that owns the ship, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., didn’t respond to calls and emails seeking comment. The company that manages the ship, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement Ltd., also didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />A lawyer for the Japanese company has previously blamed the Suez Canal Authority for allowing the ship to enter the canal during a massive sandstorm that was taking place in Egypt at the time. Initial investigations into the accident had focused on a sudden gust of wind.</td>

All this comes as Colombia is logging one of the world’s highest per capita Covid-19 death rates.</td>

      <td>TEL AVIV—Israeli right-wing politician Naftali Bennett said Sunday he plans to join a rival in a coalition opposed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, paving the way for the formation of a government that would end the incumbent’s more than decadelong grip on power.<br />“It is my intention to act with all my power to establish a national unity government with my friend Yair Lapid so that we can save this country from this spiral and get it back on path,” Mr. Bennett said. “We can stop this insanity and take responsibility.”<br />Mr. Bennett’s Yamina party is expected to be the main partner to Yair Lapid’s centrist Yesh Atid party in the coalition. Mr. Lapid received the mandate to form a government earlier this month after Mr. Netanyahu first failed to do so following an inconclusive March election, the country’s fourth since 2019.<br />Efforts to form a ruling coalition could still collapse as many parties from across the political spectrum try and agree on the government’s agenda and cabinet portfolios. It would also likely need the outside support of Israel’s Arab parties.<br />Mr. Lapid has until June 2 to inform the president of his government formation plan. If he fails to do so, President Reuven Rivlin would then hand responsibility for selecting a new prime minister back to Israel’s parliament before a new election is called.</td>

The official survey of purchasing managers at China’s factories has stayed above the 50 mark, which separates expansion in activity from contraction, since February 2020 amid strong demand from overseas.

      <td>Lithuanian and Polish investigators probing a diverted Ryanair flight over Belarus haven’t yet decoded information held in the plane’s black box amid early frustration with the airline’s cooperation and conflicting narratives by several governments involved.<br />Like many aircraft-related probes, investigators believe the plane’s black box—which holds devices that store operational data and cockpit audio—could hold critical information about what happened on May 23 over Belarus. But unlike in investigations involving crashes, the plane and crew are safe, and the aircraft’s black box has been available to investigators for almost a week.<br />Meanwhile, sometimes-competing jurisdictions in the probe and political sensitivities over what has become an international incident have made the investigation more complex than most.<br />“Most investigations start from a premise of determining what should have happened, then examine what did happen” and then reconcile the two and draw lessons learned, said Conor Nolan, chairman of the Virginia-based Flight Safety Foundation, which advocates for air safety. “In this case, we cannot easily determine what should have happened because it is far from clear how reliable any of the source data is.”<br />Lithuania and Poland haven’t yet determined where they will ship the black box for analysis, saying they are looking for a country that won’t appear to be politically biased. Lithuania, where the plane landed after its stop in Minsk, has opened a criminal probe. Officials there said they have interviewed passengers and debriefed the cockpit and cabin crew. The plane and crew returned Saturday to London’s Stansted Airport,  Ryanair ’s  biggest base.</td>

      <td>Transportation chief Pete Buttigieg calls for ‘clear direction’ on a deal by next week, as Democrats consider going forward without GOP votes</td>
      <td>The Biden administration said Sunday that talks over a $1.7 trillion infrastructure package would need to show a “clear direction” toward agreement by the time Congress returns from recess in early June, signaling that Democrats might be preparing to go it alone on a broad plan to rebuild roads and bridges, expand broadband service and create programs to help care for the elderly and disabled Americans.<br />Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said President Biden and members of his team would continue negotiating privately this week and said the talks with Republican lawmakers were encouraging. But he identified the return of Congress on June 7 as when the talks would need to indicate an endpoint.<br />“I think we are getting pretty close to a fish-or-cut-bait moment,” Mr. Buttigieg said during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.”<br />Negotiations over the measure have stretched for weeks as lawmakers and the White House argue over the basic questions of what should be included, how large it should be and how to pay for it.<br />A sticking point is funding for the projects. Republicans want to tap at least two sources to help pay for rebuilding roads and bridges: repurposed, unspent funds from the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief law from earlier this year; as well as user fees on electric vehicles. The Biden administration has proposed funding the measure through tax increases on corporations, including by raising the corporate rate to 28% from 21%, a plan that has drawn strong objections from Republicans.</td>

      <td>The makers of Clorox and Lysol may be some of the less-enduring beneficiaries of the Covid-19 pandemic</td>
      <td>Makers of cleansing and disinfectant products would have investors believe that people are keen to keep wiping things down post-pandemic. Common sense argues otherwise.<br />Clorox  and Lysol-maker  Reckitt Benckiser  were both major beneficiaries of the crisis, with their shares rallying around 50% and 40% respectively from the end of February 2020 to their highs last summer. Now, doubts have crept in. So far this year, Clorox is down around 13% and Reckitt is down 3%. By comparison, the S&P 500 consumer staples subindex is up around 4% over the same period.<br />Both companies argue that consumer habits have shifted more permanently, with a greater emphasis on hygiene that is likely to persist. The latest available data back this up to a degree. According to preliminary estimates from Numerator for the four weeks through May 16, sales of all-purpose cleaners and cleaning wipes were down 30% and 22% from the same period a year earlier. However, compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019, sales of these two product categories were still up by 24% and 45%.<br />While cleanser sales might well stay somewhat elevated for a while, some skepticism is in order. It isn’t just that vaccinations are rising and new Covid-19 cases are slowing in advanced markets like the U.S. and Europe. Public-health authorities have adjusted their messaging in recent months to stress that Covid-19 is mostly transmitted through the air, de-emphasizing the role of transmission via contaminated surfaces and giving regrets to many for having become compulsive cleaners. Products like hand sanitizer, which were hard to find early in the pandemic, are now in chronic oversupply.<br />Bear in mind that very few people actually enjoy cleaning in the way that home chefs who picked up new skills or equipment during the pandemic may well be pleased to keep putting them to use. Others who invested in a new Peloton might decide they prefer it to the gym, but not many will be nostalgic for their pandemic collection of Lysol wipes.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Friday’s jobs report is shaping up to be a pivotal data release for the Federal Reserve as it charts a plan for ending the easy-money policies that have propped up the economy and markets for more than a year.<br />The May report will help central bankers understand two key questions that now dominate their attention. First, how quickly is the labor market recovering jobs shed during the Covid-19 pandemic? Second, do the supply bottlenecks fueling a recent inflation upswing show any sign of diminishing?<br />The answers will help determine when the Fed begins scaling back its large bond-buying programs and how it thinks about future interest-rate increases.<br />Policy makers project a rapid recovery in the labor market this spring and summer, accompanied by moderate inflation. Such a scenario would allow the Fed to tighten monetary policy gradually and predictably, officials hope. But the path is treacherous. The mere discussion of pulling back easy money in 2013 led to turbulence in bond markets known as the “taper tantrum.”<br />Recent data have complicated matters for the central bank. The Labor Department reported this month that hiring slowed unexpectedly in April. Meanwhile consumer prices rose at a rate that was nearly twice the Fed’s target. Policy makers believe that supply bottlenecks—including challenges bringing people back into the workforce after months of being locked down in a pandemic—may have contributed.</td>

After that column, colleagues and readers flooded my inbox with emails detailing various connection and switching mishaps.<br />This year, I started experiencing a frustration of my own.

When Ms. Clark reviews projects on her iPhone, the earbuds switch to that device instead. “I lose my focus. Every time I pick up my phone, they’ll connect to it, and it goes back and forth over and over,” she said.</td>

      <td>Since opening the Inn at Little Washington in the late ’70s, the James Beard Award–winning chef Patrick O’Connell has transformed Washington, Virginia. Now he’s introducing Patty O’s Cafe & Bakery, his first new restaurant in 40 years.</td>
      <td>When Patrick O’Connell first moved to rural Washington, Virginia in 1972, he cooked inside of a decommissioned school bus attached to the back of his house. O’Connell, then 26, grew up about 80 miles away in a Washington, D.C., suburb and had saved enough money working as a waiter to buy a plot of land, and a home, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Appalachian dwellings like his often originated from scrap. “You’d add on,” O’Connell says. “It would become better and better.”<br />Now, approaching his 50th year in Washington, population 135, O’Connell, the 75-year-old chef-owner of the Inn at Little Washington, holds the deeds to 21 buildings in town, the result of a purchasing spree that began in the late 1970s when the chef first decided he wanted to run a brick-and-mortar restaurant rather than the catering outfit he’d been operating for five years. (In those days, O’Connell also worked as a butler and a house painter.) The buildings he has since acquired, first with business partner Reinhardt Lynch and then solo, after their 2006 separation, constitute the inn’s campus: 23 lavishly decorated guest rooms and cottages, a Michelin-three-star dining room, a ballroom and shops.<br />Aside from the inn’s kitchen, which is housed in new construction and recently underwent a roughly million-dollar upgrade, O’Connell classifies each of his buildings as a “restoration, transformation or resurrection.” This summer, work will be completed on one such project, Patty O’s Cafe & Bakery, O’Connell’s first new restaurant since 1978, when he opened the inn itself.<br />O’Connell’s holdings date back to the 18th century and represent a number of different styles of architecture, from Colonial Revival to Jeffersonian. Throughout the decades, O’Connell has bolstered his real-estate portfolio in order to accommodate the sustained demand to visit the inn. In doing so, he continues to build a world of his own florid design: a series of meticulously restored colonial American facades whose interiors bear Moroccan lanterns, Balinese umbrellas and animal murals. It all reflects his maximal and fantastical ideas about hospitality, which he describes as a feeling of going to your grandmother’s house if your grandmother dropped acid. “People can come here and be whoever they want, wherever they want,” O’Connell says. “They can bring their own script and escape.”<br />O’Connell owns about a block and a half of the four-block downtown. Washington’s mayor, Thomas Catlin, calls O’Connell a visionary, describing how the chef’s oeuvre has helped safeguard Washington against the kind of rural decay that’s ubiquitous throughout Appalachia. In addition to the inn’s long list of accolades and its critical success (O’Connell won the James Beard Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019, and the inn remains the only restaurant in the Michelin Guide for Washington, D.C., with a three-star rating), it is also its county’s largest private employer. The inn’s tax revenue has long paid for the vast majority of Washington’s budget. “We pay them well over $1,000 per day,” O’Connell says. In O’Connell’s case, municipal interest and self-interest have merged. For the inn to thrive as a world-class destination, he believes it must be aligned with the town. “The more we’ve invested, the more there is here for us to protect,” he says.</td>

      <td>WarnerMedia-Discovery merger among many high-profile moves bolstering streaming services’ offerings of reality TV and documentaries</td>
      <td>Stories starring real people are attracting some of the world’s biggest celebrities, from the Obamas to Kim Kardashian, as nonfiction programming has become essential to companies aiming to build streaming services.<br />Unscripted shows and documentary projects tend to be cheaper to make than their scripted counterparts, offering the potential for bigger profits if they become popular. According to market-research company Reelgood, the cumulative number of reality TV shows offered on streaming services nearly doubled in the first quarter of this year when compared with 2020.<br />AT&T Inc.  placed a premium on this type of entertainment in its recent deal to merge WarnerMedia with  Discovery Inc.,  a big player in unscripted programming known for its top-rated reality franchise “90 Day Fiancé” and others, such as “Fixer Upper.” Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav said after the deal was announced that combining his company’s expertise in unscripted productions with WarnerMedia’s prowess in scripted shows will be explosive.<br />In addition, the Kardashians are putting out a new show on  Walt Disney Co. ’s Hulu streaming service, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Archewell Productions is making a documentary series for  Netflix Inc.  about military veterans competing in athletics after experiencing debilitating injuries or illnesses. Former President Barack and Michelle Obama’s company has found success producing unscripted projects, including last year’s Oscar-winner for best documentary, “American Factory.”<br />ViacomCBS Inc. CEO Bob Bakish, who is trying to build out his company’s streaming service Paramount+, recently dubbed unscripted programming “the fastest-growing genre in streaming.” The company spent $15 billion on content last year and has made nonfiction a priority with shows such as the tattoo artist series “Ink Master” and docuseries “From Cradle to Stage,” directed by Foo Fighters lead singer Dave Grohl.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Economists and policy makers are debating whether stimulus spending and easy monetary policy are fueling inflation. Many businesses say there is another culprit that should share the blame: import tariffs.<br />The Trump administration implemented tariffs on products including lumber, steel and semiconductors to shield American companies from a glut of cheap imported products from China and other countries.<br />The tariffs have long been opposed by U.S. companies that import the goods and pay the levies. They are making a new push for the Biden administration to lift them, on grounds that tariffs contribute to rising prices and product shortages that are accompanying the post-pandemic recovery.<br />“I have had 15 price increases from my primary steel supplier since September,” said Scott Buehrer, president of B. Walter & Co., a Wabash, Ind., maker of fabricated metal products. “What’s the justification for these tariffs when you have sky-high steel prices?”<br />Some economists say the tariffs have had only muted effects on prices and that their removal won’t do much to ease the price pressure.</td>

      <td>Many people curbed their spending and lenders waived fees, pushing down overdraft revenue nearly 10% in 2020</td>
      <td>Legislators slammed banks last week for the money they made from overdraft fees. It turns out, though, that overdraft revenue fell in 2020 for the first time in six years.<br />The reasons? With nowhere to go when Covid-19 hit, many people curbed their spending. Stimulus money helped them pad their bank accounts. And banks were also more lenient about waiving the fees.<br />Financial firms brought in an estimated $31.3 billion in consumer overdraft revenue in 2020, according to financial-data firm Moebs Services Inc., down nearly 10% from the year before. The number of overdraft transactions in 2020 fell to less than 1 billion after topping that mark for about two decades, Moebs found, and the median fee last year was $30.<br />The decline in overall fees is another example of how Covid-19 changed consumer finance in surprising ways. At the start of the pandemic, U.S. lenders feared a huge surge in delinquencies. But then the government stepped in with expanded unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, and many people were able to save money and pay off debt. Many banks also waived some overdraft fees, especially early in the pandemic.<br />Fees of all types are important to banks’ revenue, especially in a year when low interest rates crimped lending profitability and loan demand was low. More people could start racking up overdraft fees when government stimulus measures end.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—Researchers on a boat off the southern coast of Australia recently began throwing some 50,000 bags of sand into the ocean. Their goal is to restore about two dozen acres of seagrass on the ocean floor that will suck carbon out of the atmosphere.<br />The move is part of an intensified push in some countries to slow warming temperatures on the planet by not only preserving or restoring trees—which also absorb carbon—but also by mending habitats along the world’s coastlines.<br />These so-called “blue carbon” areas, which aside from meadows of underwater seagrass also include mangroves and tidal marshes, often store more carbon per acre than forests and hold it for a long time, scientists say. From Australia to Colombia to the U.S., these coastal zones are becoming a priority for conservation and restoration as researchers and policy makers start to appreciate their potential to take carbon out of the atmosphere.<br />Carbon released into the atmosphere from man-made sources such as fossil-fuel-burning power plants and cars is contributing to a warming climate, many scientists say, which is why researchers are seeking ways to capture and store it.<br />“We looked at our coastal ecosystems and we realized there is actually quite a large potential there,” said Neil McFarlane, an official overseeing climate-change strategy for South Australia, one of the country’s six states. “Blue carbon is a whole area that we believe hasn’t been explored nearly hard enough.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden has nominated agency heads and leadership throughout the federal government at a faster clip than his recent predecessors. But a large portion of the president’s choices await Senate confirmation.<br />More than four months into his presidency, Mr. Biden has made 244 cumulative nominations to Senate-confirmed positions, more than double the number made by President Donald Trump at this stage of the administration, according to data compiled by the Center for Presidential Transition. The pace of Mr. Biden’s nominations for the roughly 1,200-Senate confirmed positions has also surpassed those of Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.<br />But while Mr. Biden’s cabinet nominees were confirmed relatively quickly, he trails those three in overall Senate confirmations at this point of his presidency, clearing 53 of his nominees so far. The lack of Senate-confirmed leaders throughout the government can lead to delays in implementing executive actions and initiatives within federal agencies, with some cabinet-level departments led by secretaries and deputy secretaries at this stage and many key positions filled with acting leadership.<br />Through the end of May of their first year in office, Mr. Clinton had 151 confirmations, Mr. Obama had secured 145 and Mr. Bush had 126, according to Center for Presidential Transition data. Through the same time frame, Mr. Trump had received 42 Senate confirmations.<br />Mr. Biden is expected to unveil as soon as this week a slate of nominees to serve as ambassadors around the globe. The group is expected to include  Morgan Stanle y executive Tom Nides in Israel, veteran diplomat R. Nicholas Burns in China, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in India and former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar in Mexico, according to people familiar with the discussions.</td>

Demonstrators have targeted police with rocks, Molotov cocktails and sometimes firearms; the police have responded with tear gas and, in some cases, gunfire, videos of the encounters show.<br />“This deployment will almost triple our capability in less than 24 hours throughout the province,” Mr. Duque said. As of Saturday, more than 1,140 troops had arrived in Cali and began dismantling the roadblocks that antigovernment demonstrators have assembled on major thoroughfares.<br />The government is aiming to beef up security forces in places where Mr. Duque said authorities “have seen acts of vandalism, violence and low-intensity urban terrorism.” Army and marine troops were to be deployed in the country’s key Pacific port, Buenaventura, and in a total of 10 of Colombia’s 32 provinces.</td>

      <td>OTTAWA—A Canadian west-coast indigenous community says it discovered the remains of more than 200 children it believes attended a state-run school, reopening wounds about the country’s centurylong mistreatment of its indigenous people.<br />The Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation, in the province of British Columbia, said the remains of an estimated 215 children were found through the use of ground-penetrating radar, which surveyed nearby territory where a government-funded boarding school for indigenous students once operated. The First Nation, based in the town of Kamloops, expects to complete its findings in mid-June.<br />“We’re still grappling through the effects,” Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation said Friday at a press conference. “This loss is absolutely unthinkable.”<br />Political leaders, led by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have relayed their condolences to the indigenous community. “It is a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country’s history,” Mr. Trudeau said via his official Twitter account. Mr. Trudeau has worked to advance reconciliation with the country’s 1.7 million indigenous people, which he has made a policy priority since coming to office. Indigenous Canadians make up roughly 5% of the total 38 million population and fare poorly on a range of indicators, with higher rates of suicide, incarceration and infant mortality than the general population.<br />For more than a century, Canada’s residential school system, as it was known, separated some 150,000 indigenous children from their families. An estimated 4,100 children died of disease or by accident while in the system, according to an inquiry report in 2015, which said the school system was akin to cultural genocide. The inquiry said a complete death toll might never be known because officials at the time destroyed hundreds of records.</td>

Banks and other lenders issued the loans, which the SBA guaranteed.<br />After the program’s general funding was exhausted in early May, funds had remained only for certain community lenders to issue the loans.

      <td>By putting the first American in orbit in 1962, NASA ensured a civilian future for space exploration</td>
      <td>John F. Kennedy had not even taken the oath of office when the battle began. In December 1960, with the inauguration a month away, the U.S. Air Force launched a first strike—not against a foreign enemy but against NASA, the civilian space agency. In a letter to commanders, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force expressed confidence that the president-elect understood the imperative of “military supremacy in space” and would, therefore, grant the Air Force the primary role. Making sure that Kennedy got the point, the Air Force leaked its letter.<br />“Space Fight,” cheered Aviation Week. Yet this was more than a turf war. At stake was the very purpose of the U.S. space program. Would the nation stay committed to “space for peace,” the policy of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the outgoing president? Or would the new administration see space as the Air Force did: an arena of the Cold War, a battlefront on which armed conflict might be inevitable? The decision was Kennedy’s to make—though it would come to depend, as events unfolded, on an astronaut named John Glenn.<br />To the Air Force top brass, the existence of NASA was an affront. The Space Act of 1958, which created NASA and gave it control over human spaceflight, was a rebuke to every military planner with fantasies of orbital fighter planes or space stations teeming with missiles. At a time when the Soviet Union was achieving one “first” after another—the first satellite, the first animal in orbit, the first unmanned craft to reach the lunar surface—Eisenhower held to his view that space exploration served no national security interest. As a concession, he allowed the Air Force to continue development of the X-20, a high-altitude bomber, but the “man-in-space” program, Project  Mercury ,  was NASA’s domain.<br />Kennedy’s election gave the generals cause for hope. “If the Soviets control space,” he had said during the campaign, “they can control earth.” In the eyes of the world, he argued, “second in space” meant second in science and technology, second in military power, second in the struggle between freedom and totalitarian rule. In late 1960, a classified U.S. Information Agency report—which caused a stir when it leaked—revealed that Soviet superiority in space was eroding global confidence in the U.S. “Satellite pessimism,” analysts called it. Pressure was building for a show of strength in space.<br />And NASA held a weakening hand. The astronauts were popular with the public, but the manned program was well behind schedule and marred by failure. Rockets exploded on the launchpad; payloads ended up in the sea. Rumors circulated that Kennedy would transfer Mercury to the military or cancel it altogether—a course that his science adviser, Jerome Wiesner, preferred.</td>

Nights out and weekend excursions (of the non-socially distanced variety) are becoming relatively commonplace again. “A Quiet Place Part II” and “Cruella” have just opened in movie theaters across the country and, if not as failure-proof as past Memorial Day Weekend blockbusters, they are each expected to pull in up to $40 or $50 million in their first weekend.

      <td>Federal agents and the New York Police Department are fighting a rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes by launching new investigations and increasing community outreach and patrols in affected neighborhoods.<br />Federal Bureau of Investigation officials said agents discussed anti-Semitic crimes with Jewish groups and held meetings and conference calls with community leaders in May as more than two dozen crimes with anti-Semitic motivations were reported to the NYPD.<br />The FBI also intensified a public-relations campaign to encourage reporting of such crimes to authorities in New York. The push includes posters with instructions for reporting hate crimes in languages including Yiddish, Hebrew and Mandarin.<br />The FBI defines hate crimes as crimes in which perpetrators act on a bias against the victim’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, or other categories. Hate crimes potentially carry a more severe penalty than crimes without the designation.<br />William Sweeney, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s New York Field Office, said hate crimes against Jews in New York rose when fighting in the Middle East between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas recently began. The two sides agreed to a cease-fire starting May 21 after 11 days of conflict.</td>

      <td>HP and Dell have been the hottest stocks in tech, but fears the personal-computer market is peaking are starting to weigh</td>
      <td>Life has been good lately for  HP  and  Dell Technologies .  Many investors seem to think the PC business is as good as it gets.<br />Booming demand for personal computers has made HP and  Dell  two of the strongest large-cap tech stocks so far this year. Before their latest quarterly reports late Thursday, HP was up 31% for the year, while Dell had jumped 36%. That far exceeds the performance of both  Microsoft  and  Apple —the market’s two most valued companies, who also have a fair amount of exposure to the PC market.<br />That set a high bar for the two companies’ results for the fiscal quarter ended in April. But both came through. HP’s revenue surged 27% year-over-year to about $15.9 billion, notching the company’s best growth since splitting with its  Hewlett Packard Enterprise  sibling in 2015. Dell’s revenue jumped 12% year-over-year to about $24.5 billion. Both well exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. PC sales account for a little over half of Dell’s total revenue and a little over 60% of HP’s.<br />Still, both stocks fell Friday following their results. HP shares fell 9% as analysts noted that its per-share earnings projection for the fiscal year ending in October reflects pressure coming in the second half of the year. The company racked that up to “increased costs in commodities and logistics.” It also said the continuing chip shortage will hurt its ability to meet demand in both PCs and printers. Dell shares slipped by 1.1%, as the company also cited supply constraints as a factor for July quarter revenue to be “slightly below our normal sequential pattern over the past few years.”<br />PCs have been a mature business for years; the sector saw unit sales shrink globally every year from 2012-2018, according to both Gartner and IDC, which track PC sales. Microsoft’s end of support for Windows 7 sparked a small upgrade cycle in 2019, but the pandemic really juiced demand, as workers and students sent home rushed to equip themselves. Unit sales of PC and Chromebooks jumped 13% to 302.6 million in 2020, and surged by 55% year-over-year in the first quarter, according to IDC’s data.</td>

Treasury officials said Friday that some campaign proposals need more work and others may appear in future plans.<br />The deduction “just seems to be kind of without redeeming qualities and frankly, I was a little surprised that the Biden administration didn’t propose curtailing it,” said William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning Washington think tank.<br />Kevin Kuhlman, vice president of government relations at the National Federation of Independent Business, said he had been bracing for the deduction to be removed.</td>

But powerful as Smith’s limber Tanktotems, confrontational Zigs and athletic Cubi—to name only a few series—are, they are not the whole story.<br />Smith was a painter before he was a sculptor, he often said that he “belonged” with painters, and he continually explored the transformative effect of color on three-dimensional structures, aspiring, he said, to combine painting and sculpture into a new, superior art form. Throughout his too-short working life—he died in 1965 at age 59, in an automobile accident—Smith concentrated on sculpture, but he also drew and painted in a wide range of materials and techniques, dividing his day into a proletarian double shift, making sculpture in the factory-like space where he constructed in steel, and drawing and painting in what he called his “clean studio.”<br />Smith used photography both to record and transform his sculpture, capturing constructions in different lights and weathers, and making modest works appear monumental. He made reliefs, designed medals, and experimented with stone and casting in bronze. He tossed ideas back and forth in different mediums, testing the potential of imagined forms as drawings, expanding them and contextualizing them in paintings, realizing them in three dimensions, and photographing them—not necessarily in that order.</td>

Elsewhere, including in urban areas and tourist hubs that have been slower to ease restrictions—such as New York and Hawaii—labor demand is rebounding more gradually, making the shortages of workers less acute.<br />The northern Mountain West, the Plains, and northern New England stand out as having especially tight labor markets, with about three open positions for every one unemployed job seeker in April, according to an analysis by job search site ZipRecruiter.<br />Several factors are contributing to the labor shortages across the country. They include enhanced unemployment benefits that might provide a financial disincentive to take low-wage jobs, still-limited schools and child-care availability keeping parents home, and fear of Covid-19. In addition to the extent of government restrictions placed on businesses amid the pandemic, additional regional features help distinguish the hotter labor markets from the cooler.<br />All three hot regions had below average unemployment even before the pandemic, though different reasons are behind today’s tight labor market.</td>

The lawsuits involve a distinctive dark-green-and-yellow earplug designed to fully block noise if inserted into the ear in one direction, with the other side intended to let in nearby voices but shield the ear from harmful ballistic noises.<br />The first trial ended with a $7.1 million verdict for three veterans who blamed the earplugs for hearing loss and tinnitus, or a ringing in the ears.<br />3M stopped selling the earplugs in 2015 and has stood by the safety of the product. In 2018, the company reached a $9.1 million settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, without admitting to any liability, to resolve allegations in a whistleblower complaint that 3M failed to disclose deficiencies in the product.<br />The majority of the claims have been consolidated in front of U.S. District Judge M. Casey Rodgers in Pensacola, Fla., in a process known as multidistrict litigation. The judge selected plaintiffs for three so-called bellwether trials, which will help give both sides a sense of how juries react to the claims.</td>

BitConnect told investors it would profitably trade their bitcoin using an automated “trading bot” and required the currency to be locked up for terms ranging from four to 10 months, according to the SEC’s lawsuit. BitConnect eventually lost 92% of its value, and investors lost all or nearly all of their funds in the lending program, the SEC’s lawsuit said. Thousands invested in BitConnect.<br />The SEC sued BitConnect promoters Trevon Brown of Myrtle Beach, S.C., Craig Grant of Kissimmee, Fla., Ryan Maasen of Tulsa, Okla., and Michael Noble of Pacific Palisades, Calif.

      <td>A blowout for the ages on everything but defense and security.</td>
      <td>Happy Memorial Day or should we say Covid Liberation Day. President Biden is celebrating with the $6 trillion budget he released Friday that, in its willful magnitude, is unprecedented in American peacetime history. Democrats with their narrow majorities in Congress have no mandate for this, but they plan to jam most of it through anyway.<br />As the pandemic finally eases due to vaccines, the emergency spending of the last two fiscal years should recede. The booming economy doesn’t need it. Consumers are flush with Covid relief payments and demand is soaring. Yet Mr. Biden wants to keep using the cover of Covid to sneak through an expansion of government that would be historic and permanent.<br />The nearby chart on spending and taxes as a share of GDP tells the larger fiscal story. World War II was the only comparable period with so much spending and new debt as the last two years. But once the war ended, military spending fell. Economic growth slowly reduced government debt as a share of GDP.<br />Not this time. If Mr. Biden gets his way, spending in fiscal 2022 will still be $6 trillion, which is some $2 trillion more than before the pandemic in 2019. Then spending will keep rising and remain a little under 25% of GDP for the rest of the decade. That level has never been reached in a single year since World War II, and the postwar pre-Covid average was 19.4%.<br />Even this level of spending is surely understated since much of it will finance Mr. Biden’s new cradle-to-grave federal entitlements for child care, paid family leave, community college and more. These are mandatory programs that don’t require an annual Congressional appropriation.</td>

      <td>The aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan will deploy from its home port in Japan to the Middle East this summer to support the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. The move came at the request of U.S. Central Command and was approved by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.<br />The Reagan’s deployment undermines the claim—made by the past three American presidents—that the Indo-Pacific is America’s priority. It also suggests that the Biden administration is conducting a phantom withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan—removing boots on the ground to fulfill a campaign promise to end “forever wars,” but replacing ground operations with other forces conducting similar missions at great difficulty and expense.<br />A carrier has been present in the Middle East for years, which is wearing out the Navy’s carrier force. The USS Abraham Lincoln spent more than 220 days operating in the region on a 295-day deployment that ended in January 2020, the longest of any carrier since the end of the Cold War.<br />The USS Eisenhower, currently operating in the Middle East, is on a “double pump” back-to-back deployment. The carrier spent more than 200 consecutive days at sea on its previous deployment. It can no longer put off repairs, and due to years of high carrier demand, the only carrier available to backfill it is the Reagan. That means the U.S. won’t have an aircraft carrier in the Indo-Pacific for months.<br />The Pentagon frequently touts the Indo-Pacific as its priority theater; Mr. Austin has said, “China is our pacing threat.” Indeed, the 2018 National Defense Strategy said that if necessary, the U.S. should accept risk in the Middle East and other theaters to focus assets and resources in the Pacific.</td>

A court judgment released Friday shows that a judge penalized former pro-democracy lawmaker and journalist Claudia Mo for speaking to Western journalists, including our own Jillian Melchior.<br />Police arrested Ms. Mo, along with nearly the entire opposition movement, in January. She and 46 others are charged with conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law for organizing or participating in an informal pro-democracy primary election last July. Judge Esther Toh denied Ms. Mo bail in April, and the world learned why on Friday.<br />The national security law prohibits “collusion” with vaguely defined foreign forces and states that defendants may not receive bail “unless the judge has sufficient grounds” to believe that they “will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.” As a reason to keep Ms. Mo behind bars, prosecutor Maggie Yang described Ms. Mo’s WhatsApp correspondence with these pages, the New York Times, Bloomberg and the BBC.<br />In a court filing explaining her denial of bail, Judge Toh quotes from an Oct. 1, 2020, conversation Ms. Mo had with Ms. Melchior about 12 Hong Kongers who were captured after they tried to escape to Taiwan by boat.<br />Ms. Mo told Ms. Melchior: “The detention and treatment of the 12 Hong Kong protesters serve as the ultimate warning and threat to Hongkongers about what one can face if you’re caught. The new security law and the spate of arrests have worked as a scare tactic, probably fairly successfully—at sending a persistent political chill around the city.” Every word of that is true, and it was hardly a secret.</td>

Now Oklahoma is rewarding its citizens by cutting taxes to make the state more competitive.<br />Republicans control the House, Senate and governorship in the Sooner State, and last week Gov.

Effective Jan. 1, the corporate income tax will drop to 4% from 6%, and the legislation also cuts individual income tax rates across the board by 0.25 percentage points. The top rate falls to 4.75%. These could amount to as much as $347 million in tax relief for fiscal year 2022.<br />“We walked into a situation this session where we did not have a fiscal crisis because we kept the state’s economy open to the greatest extent possible while caring for the health and safety of the citizens of this state,” says Oklahoma House Speaker Charles McCall. The state had projected a $1.4 billion revenue decline in the dark days of spring 2020 but began its 2021 legislative session with a $1.6 billion surplus. “It was the perfect time to institute some tax relief,” says Mr. McCall.<br />The new rates mean Oklahoma will now rank sixth lowest among states that assess personal income tax and tied with Missouri as second lowest among states with a corporate income tax, according to the Tax Foundation. Oklahoma requires either a three-fourths legislative majority or a voter referendum to raise taxes, so the cuts have some staying power.<br />Oklahoma is betting that its low taxes will attract businesses and newcomers. It still trails neighboring Texas, an economic powerhouse without an income tax. But its rates are competitive with those of other states in the region. The Sooner State joins Montana, Idaho and Iowa as states that have cut income taxes since the pandemic began, according to the Tax Foundation.</td>

      <td>U.S. employers could require all workers physically entering a workplace to be vaccinated against Covid-19, the federal government said Friday.<br />The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued updated guidance stating that federal laws don’t prevent an employer from requiring workers to be vaccinated.<br />However, in some circumstances, federal laws may require the employer to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who, because of a disability or a religious belief, aren’t vaccinated. For example, the EEOC said as a reasonable accommodation, an unvaccinated employee entering the workplace might wear a face mask, work at a social distance or be given the opportunity to telework.<br />The new guidelines also say that federal laws don’t prevent or limit incentives that can be offered to workers to voluntarily take the vaccine. And employers that are administering vaccines to their employees may also offer incentives, as long as the incentives aren’t coercive.<br />The updated guidance is intended to answer frequently asked questions, EEOC Chairwoman Charlotte Burrows said in a statement. She said the agency will continue to update and clarify its assistance for employers.</td>

      <td>We heard screams all through the night. Today only four known Jews remain in Iraq.</td>
      <td>I was 10 when mobs attacked the Jewish community of Baghdad, my community, with cruel and unimaginable violence. Rioters maimed, raped, killed and robbed the unsuspecting Jews. This massacre, which began June 1, 1941, was called the Farhud, Arabic for “violent dispossession” or pogrom.<br />The seeds of the Farhud had been sown two months earlier. On April 1, a pro-Nazi coup d’état overthrew the pro-British Iraqi government and seized power. The coup was staged by Rashid Ali al Gaylani, an Arab nationalist and former Iraqi prime minister, supported by four army generals, and aided by Fritz Grobba, a former German ambassador to Iraq. This dangerous group was further stoked by the grand mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al Husseini, who deeply hated the Jews. Anti-Semitic propaganda began to appear in the daily newspapers and in broadcasts on Radio Baghdad. It was intended to inflame the Muslim population and rally support for the new regime.<br />The Jewish community bore the brunt of this explosive combination of Arab nationalism, Nazi propaganda and anti-Semitism. In the weeks after the coup my family stayed home most of the time, huddled around the large console radio. We listened with disbelief to reports of Jews being arrested and accused of anti-Iraqi sentiment and of spying for the British. I shook just thinking of the torture being carried out to extract false confessions.<br />On May 31, 1941, the British army arrived at the outskirts of Baghdad. The pro-Nazi government collapsed quickly, but al Gaylani and his co-conspirators escaped to Iran. The Jewish community in Baghdad felt a sense of relief, especially as it coincided with the eve of the Shavuot festival, commemorating the time when God gave us the Ten Commandments. We had good reason to rejoice.<br />But that high spirit didn’t last long, and joy reverted to pain and sorrow. The absence of a functioning government created a power vacuum. Across the country, chaos and lawlessness followed.</td>

Executives also deliberated over having Mr. Blatt address the allegation, a draft resignation letter Mr. Blatt sent to independent public-relations representatives showed.<br />“We need to get specific on the date of when the Board adopted a CEO transition plan, and it needs to pre-date the incident for the story to be credible should all of this come to light,” said IAC communications chief Valerie Combs in a July 7, 2017, email to IAC Chief Executive Joey Levin, according to the filing.<br />Three weeks after the exchange, a press release announcing Mr. Blatt’s resignation as CEO of both Match Group and dating app Tinder didn’t mention the allegation or an investigation that Match Group conducted. IAC Chairman Barry Diller said in the press release that Mr. Blatt had approached him nearly a year earlier about a potential job change and that the CEO’s departure came after months of discussion and planning.<br />IAC, which separated from Match Group last year, said in a statement that an investigation by Match Group’s board with two outside law firms found no violation of law or company policy. Based on the investigation’s findings, there was no cause for Mr. Blatt to resign and, therefore, no cause to disclose it. “The company has nothing to hide,” a spokesperson for IAC said in a statement.</td>

      <td>The news business is headed for trouble if it won’t control its biases as other professions do.</td>
      <td>On what basis was the lab leak theory ruled out for months by the media despite the lack of any evidence or logic for ruling it out? We’re bad journalists, has been the unembarrassed answer from the media this week in a wide array of print and online publications as well as National Public Radio.<br />We in the press dismissed the lab theory because of an appeal to authority: When anti-Donald Trump spokespeople ridiculed it, that was good enough for us. We dismissed it because of the equivocation fallacy: “Chinese” is a word that can be used to denote a racial category. Therefore it was racist to suggest a Chinese lab might have leaked the virus.<br />We engaged in availability bias: Instead of letting the evidence or lack thereof guide us, we adopted the attitudes of public figures whose political, cultural and social status we wished to emulate. Most insidiously, we relied on a fallacy sometimes known as “alleged certainty”: “The question remains open” is not a headline that attracts clicks. A headline that does is “lab leak theory again proves Trump’s incompetence.”<br />Alas, the question of Covid’s origins not only remains open; in all likelihood it will defy final resolution unless and until the Chinese government is forthcoming with its own records, which it has shown a predilection not to be. The lab leak hypothesis has an unsettling corollary. In nature, the giant mixing bowl of natural selection is mechanism enough to explain how a virus adapted to bats might mutate to become infectious in humans. If it escaped from a lab, how did such a virus acquire the ability to infect humans? “Gain of function” experimentation was a controversial practice among virologists long before Covid. Multiple accidental releases of dangerous viruses from highly secure labs have been recorded in the past. The SARS virus has escaped six times since being identified in 2003. The 1977 global flu pandemic is believed to have originated in the escape from an unknown lab of a specimen collected in the 1950s.<br />Unfortunately the question of Covid’s origins is likely to be adjudicated for the foreseeable future on circumstantial evidence alone, thanks to Beijing’s recalcitrance. Where is China’s own 1,000-page, data-filled report on the virus’s emergence? China is home to the world’s leading bat virus experts. It should own the science here. Its failure to issue any findings at all is itself circumstantial evidence of a kind.</td>

      <td>Children who are fully vaccinated don’t need to wear face masks or maintain physical distancing from one another at camp this summer, federal health officials said Friday, in their latest move to relax pandemic guidelines for people who have received shots.<br />Yet camps should still encourage children and staff who aren’t fully vaccinated to wear a mask indoors, as well as outdoors in areas where Covid-19 is spreading, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.<br />The agency updated its recommendations as school is letting out and summer camps are getting into swing across the country. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a Covid-19 vaccine for adolescents earlier this month, prompting the CDC to make the updates. Some camps said they would now rush to make last-minute changes to take the new guidance into account.<br />“When we have the opportunity where everybody is fully vaccinated, you can get back to no masks, no distancing and a normal camp experience,” said Erin Sauber-Schatz, who heads the CDC’s Community Interventions and Critical Populations Task Force.<br />The CDC advised two weeks ago that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear face masks or physically distance indoors or outdoors, in large groups or small. That guidance created many questions, including what campers, travelers and schools should do, given that those settings involve people being in close quarters.</td>

In scheduling the vote and others that lack bipartisan support, Mr. Schumer is signaling that he is willing to pivot away from areas that unify the Democratic caucus or have bipartisan support and put the emphasis on more politically challenging measures.<br />“The next few weeks will be hard and will test our resolve as a Congress and a conference,” he said Friday.<br />The Democrats’ progressive wing has grown increasingly impatient over the lack of action in the Senate, where Mr. Schumer has chosen to devote recent months to bipartisan initiatives, like a water-infrastructure bill that passed nearly unanimously and a measure to help the U.S. maintain its lead in technology.<br />The voting measure, known as S-1 because it was the first bill introduced in the Senate this session, lacks bipartisan support and hasn’t drawn the backing of Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.). But it is viewed by the Democratic base as essential if the party is to maintain control of the House and the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections.</td>

      <td>In the decades following the American Revolution, the governments that counted were those that met in state capitals.</td>
      <td>Alan Taylor is one of America’s most distinguished historians. He is the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor at the University of Virginia, a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History and the author of 10 previous books, nearly all dealing with early American history. Mr. Taylor describes this one, “American Republics: A Continental History of the United States, 1783-1850,” as a sequel to his two earlier books, “American Colonies: The Settling of North America” (2001) and “American Revolutions: A Continental History, 1750-1804” (2016). His book is written in clear, readable prose designed for readers with little or no prior knowledge of the period, and the work has touches of wokeness, which helps to fit it nicely into this extraordinary moment in our history.<br />Mr. Taylor did not intend his book to be a comprehensive account of the antebellum decades; he calls it “a concise introduction,” covering “some conventional topics,” including Alexander Hamilton’s financial program, Thomas Jefferson’s attempt to diminish the size of the federal government, Andrew Jackson’s war on the national bank and the efforts of Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth to challenge the slave system of the South. Although Mr. Taylor’s history of the period inevitably features the United States, he signals his divergence from a parochial and xenophobic account by including brief forays into the histories of the countries bordering the United States. These are left out of the usual histories of the United States, and Mr. Taylor’s use of them enriches his history. The presence of the border countries in his chronicle, and his correct belief that the American governments that counted most were those of the separate states, and not the federal government, account for the plural “Republics” in his title.<br />Mr. Taylor’s introduction sets the tone for the book. He never fails to point out the discrepancies between the ideals of the white Americans and the sordid realities of their behavior. Some, for example, found the class divisions in Washington, D.C., to be as severe as anywhere in the world, which leads Mr. Taylor to conclude that Americans, “while denying the power of class in public life, . . . practiced it with a vengeance in private circles.” He uses Washington, D.C., as a base and compares it with other capitals of the various nations and empires surrounding the United States. It does not come out well.<br />Not only did Washington remain raw and unpopulated throughout the period, but one third of its people remained enslaved. Mexico City was nearly 300 years older than Washington, and 20 times bigger and 40 times grander, and it had no slaves and claimed to have dissolved all racial distinctions. Port-au-Prince, the capital of the black republic Haiti, the second republic in the New World, suffered from earthquakes, hurricanes and wars, but, says Mr. Taylor, at least its people were free, and it was more populous than Washington. Even York (later Toronto), the capital of Upper Canada, grew faster than the U.S. capital. The native Cherokees created a republic, too, and in the 1820s built a capital, New Echota, in northwestern Georgia. It was, alas, soon overrun by white migrants eager to build cotton plantations worked by enslaved African-Americans.<br />During the decades following the Revolution, the United States was weak and vulnerable to pressure from their neighbors. Mr. Taylor rightly stresses that the country was not a nation, but a union of states each keenly conscious of its autonomy and very suspicious of one another. As the author nicely puts it, “mutual distrust was the bond of union.” Americans tended to avoid the term “nation” and used “union” instead. But that union was fragile, and the threat of disunion was constant. Most realized that slavery was, as one newspaper editor put it, “the weak point of our Union,” as it proved to be.</td>

      <td>The 1976 Hyde Amendment, included in spending legislation for decades, is backed by most Republicans</td>
      <td>President Biden’s budget proposal removes language banning the use of federal dollars for abortions in most cases, fulfilling a campaign pledge and setting up a fight in Congress, where most Republicans are opposed to the change.<br />The president’s budget, released Friday, doesn’t include the 1976 Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortion with exceptions for victims of rape or incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. The language has been included in spending legislation for decades, and Mr. Biden had supported the amendment for years before reversing his position during his presidential campaign. Abortion-rights advocates and many Democrats had urged him to do so.<br />Abortion opponents say the amendment ensures federal tax dollars don’t go to paying for the procedure, while advocates for access to abortions say it disproportionately affects low-income women and women of color who are Medicaid recipients.<br />The decision from the president comes as some Republican-led states add new restrictions on abortions and the Supreme Court prepares to consider the legality of a Mississippi abortion law that sought to ban the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy.<br />While this marked the first time in decades that a president sought to strip the language, the change wasn’t highlighted in a budget fact sheet released by the White House. Some abortion-rights advocates have pushed for Mr. Biden to be more vocal on the issue, noting that he didn’t use the word abortion in a statement marking the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision recognizing a woman’s right to have an abortion, or in his recent address to a joint session of Congress.</td>

Large investors have been criticized for being all talk and no action on getting the companies they invest in to change their policies around sustainability. Exxon’s yearslong refusal to make board directors available for frank conversations irked investors.<br />Energy giant Exxon fought hard to fend off the dissident slate. Company officials continued to lobby shareholders even as Wednesday’s annual meeting neared adjournment.<br />Exxon said it welcomed the new directors, Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala, and looked forward to working with them. “With almost three million shareholders, it’s not surprising we heard a wide range of views, and many supported the work that we’re doing to improve earnings and cash flow capacity, as well as the work to advance the company to a lower carbon future,” a spokesman said.<br />“Today, we heard shareholders communicate a desire for ExxonMobil to further these efforts.

      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />When Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko forced a  Ryanair  plane to land in order to arrest a dissident journalist who was on board, international outrage was swift. The CEO of Ryanair, based in Ireland, called the incident “a state-sponsored hijacking.” Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin and several other European Union leaders echoed the term.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki was more cautious. “I don’t have a new definition of what happened here,” she said, adding that the White House, while condemning the action, was “not legally ready to change any of the existing language” regarding the term “hijacking.”<br />Under a narrow definition of “hijacking,” what happened to the Ryanair flight might not count. It didn’t fit the typical scenario in which someone commandeers a plane from the inside, such as by coercing the pilot at gunpoint. (The flight, bound for Vilnius, was forced to divert to Minsk because authorities from Belarus claimed there was a bomb threat. The journalist Roman Protasevich was arrested on arrival.)<br />The meaning of “hijacking” has never been entirely straightforward, and the term’s origins, while dating back a little over a century, perplex etymologists to this day.</td>

      <td><br />The Korean War ended more than two decades before the messy conclusion of the war in Vietnam. And yet a memorial to that earlier, “forgotten” war was dedicated only on July 27, 1995, 13 years after the completion on the National Mall of a wall of polished granite, etched with the names of those who died in Vietnam.<br />Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington—once so polemical—is now thought by many to be as close to reverential perfection as a war memorial can be. It has had fierce critics. Jim Webb, a Vietnam vet and U.S. senator, called it “a nihilistic slab of stone.” The wall is stark, even accusatory, and a bronze sculpture of three soldiers was added later to shush those who regarded Ms. Lin’s creation as too cerebral—even insufficiently heroic.<br />As if determined not to stoke such controversy, the Korean Veterans Memorial is, by contrast, stubbornly literal. A demotic American masterwork, it is plain-spoken and realist. It appeals to old-fashioned conceptions of what is heroic and admirable. Unlike the Vietnam Memorial, which yields its richness to those who meditate before it, the Korean Memorial fills even a child with awe—and it does so instantly, on first contact, as I found when I took my son to see it when he was 10 years old, a full decade ago. There is no sight quite like that of a small boy transfixed before statues that tower over him.<br />The monument—designed by Cooper-Lecky Architects of Washington—has many elements, including a Pool of Remembrance and a low-slung United Nations Wall that lists the 22 countries that joined the U.S. in its “police action” in Korea. Another wall, listing the names of the Americans who died, will be completed next year.</td>

Everyone who has observed British politics play out as a dance of dervishes since 2016—when Britain voted narrowly to bolt from the European Union—has been struck by how untethered from its age-old traits of stability, continuity and moderation the country has come to be.<br />As it wrestles with the effects of Brexit, which include the nitty-gritty of trade and travel as well as grander matters of identity and nationalism, Britain’s political system has combined “feverish activity with almost complete paralysis.” This “negative dialectic,” say Ailsa Henderson and Richard Wyn Jones—professors of politics at the University of Edinburgh and Cardiff University, respectively—has served to “diminish the country’s much vaunted global reputation.” The world now looks at Britain and asks why its politics is so much like that of the less fortunate lands on which the Brits have gazed (heretofore forgivably) with condescension.<br />The motor behind this unseemly change is “Englishness.” Ms. Henderson and Mr. Wyn Jones use this word as the title of their book, aiming to capture the “political force transforming Britain” (as their subtitle declares). Brexit, they argue, was less a victory for Britishness than for Englishness, which now expresses itself as a form of English nationalism fueled powerfully—but not exclusively—by Euroskeptic sentiment.<br />Although the two terms are often conflated by the English themselves, Englishness is not the same as Britishness. The former has tended to be seen as an ethnic identity, the latter as a civic one. It would be wrong, the authors say, to regard one as bad and the other as good, for the connotations that attach to both terms are complex and contradictory. Some see Britishness as “outward looking, the identity of choice for those interested in the UK on a world stage,” in contrast to an “insular, self-interested Englishness”—hence the disparaging phrase “Little Englander.” Others, by contrast, distinguish between a “peaceful and gentle” Englishness and a “colonizing and violent” Britishness.<br />In either case, the values or symbols associated with Englishness tend to be cultural: fair play, the English language, a sense of humor, the green and pleasant countryside. Those who favor a British identity are likely to focus on political elements, like the Union Jack, the Crown and Parliament.</td>

      <td>Regarding “In Israel, the Violent Legacy of 1948” (Review, May 22): The Journal has waded into a scholars’ mine field. Historians on all sides of this dispute accuse one another of grave inaccuracies and distortions.<br />Benny Morris presents a version of the events of 1947-48 that may be near the middle of the debate but isn’t in any way a consensus view. He represents a specific school of thought on this issue, usually referred to as the “New Historians,” that emerged in the 1980s. This school claims to give a more accurate account than the “traditional” Israeli one, which says that most of the Arabs who fled did so under pressure from Arab military leaders, who wanted to clear the field for a war of elimination against the Jews, and who promised the departing Arab civilians that they would be back in their homes within a few weeks.<br />But this traditional account is still far from being definitely disproved, as shown by the work of such scholars as Efraim Karsh. Nor is Prof. Morris free from severe criticism by academics at the other end of the ideological spectrum, such as Ilan Pappé, who argue that he falls far short of presenting a full exposé of Jewish/Israeli war crimes committed during this period.<br />David Hoffman<br />Jerusalem</td>

On Friday, he said Nike’s general counsel had “improperly and irresponsibly” discussed the reason for the termination of the endorsement deal. Neymar said the agreement ended for commercial reasons.<br />“Despite all the reported untruths, we will not present, for the time being, the documents that reveal the form of termination of the contract, for obvious reasons of strict secrecy and confidentiality,” his management company wrote in a message published across the player’s social media accounts.</td>

      <td>After the dismal Covid spring of 2020, many Americans are eager to resume their communal displays of gratitude for the people whose sacrifices have allowed us to live in freedom.<br />“Memorial Day Parade returns Monday,” notes a headline in The Telegraph newspaper of Alton, Ill. No rain is expected and the parade will follow its traditional route. It seems the town’s tradition proved too strong even for Covid. The Telegraph’s Ron DeBrock reports:<br />This year, such events are returning to normal. On America’s East Coast, volunteers have once again planted 37,342 American flags on Boston Common to honor all those from Massachusetts who have given their lives defending our nation since the Revolutionary War. Last year only a thousand flags were planted as the state imposed significant Covid restrictions.<br />Charlie McKenna reports for the Boston Globe on the families of the fallen who have come to honor their dead:<br />Of course those who have died for liberty come from every state. It is perhaps an especially good time to remember a hero from Colorado who died 50 years ago this week. U.S. Army Maj. William Edward Adams was a helicopter pilot who was killed trying to rescue comrades in Vietnam’s Kontum Province. When he set out he must have known how much the odds were stacked against him. The citation for his Medal of Honor notes that he “volunteered to fly a lightly armed helicopter in an attempt to evacuate three seriously wounded soldiers from a small fire base which was under attack by a large enemy force. He made the decision with full knowledge that numerous antiaircraft weapons were positioned around the base and that the clear weather would afford the enemy gunners an unobstructed view.”</td>

      <td>On an island retreat to escape allergies, the young physicist Werner Heisenberg could focus his attention on the strange world of the subatomic.</td>
      <td>Given the probabilistic basis of quantum theory, it is apt that happenstance should have been midwife at the birth of one of its most radical formulations. Had Werner Heisenberg as a young man not suffered from chronic hay fever and sought relief on the virtually treeless island of Helgoland in the North Sea off the coast of Germany, particle physics might be a very different matter from what it is today. Indeed, our concept of matter itself might be a different matter.<br />Carlo Rovelli, a theoretical physicist whose specialty is quantum gravity, is also one of the warmest, most elegant and most lucid interpreters to the laity of the dazzling enigmas of his discipline. In his new, brief but potentially momentous book “Helgoland”—translated from the Italian by Erica Segre and Simon Carnell—he takes Heisenberg as an exemplary figure, one with the “visionary force of a rebellious, critical spirit . . . capable of redesigning our world from scratch.” It is a description that, with a slight slackening of emphasis, might fit Mr. Rovelli himself, in his role as promulgator of what he terms “the ‘relational’ interpretation of quantum theory.” To which we shall return.<br />Heisenberg went to Helgoland—“Heligoland” to English-speakers—in 1925, 20 years after the publication of the Special Theory of Relativity. The world of science was in a more than usually violent state of ferment, with physicists struggling not only to establish a synthesis between Newton’s and Einstein’s differing versions of reality, but also to reach an accommodation with the baffling new ideas that would come to constitute quantum theory.<br />It was a heavy task, and one that is still far from complete, nearly a century on. Richard Feynman was not the first to say—though, being Feynman, he said it more cheerfully than did others—that no one understands quantum theory. This is despite the fact that the theory is at the heart of everything from mobile-phone technology to the formation of star systems. We investigate the stars, and do a lot talking on our phones, yet for most practical purposes we live in the world according to Newton. The macrosphere of gadgets and galaxies seems not to connect, at least not in any way that we can as yet make out, with the microsphere of quanta and quarks.<br />Only 23 when he went to Helgoland, Heisenberg brought with him a puzzle arising from work on the properties of chemical elements carried out by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr, who at the age of 40 was already one of the grand old men of physics. According to Bohr’s formulas, an electron circling the nucleus of an atom will somehow leap from one fixed orbit to another, as if by magic, seeming not to exist between leaps. Heisenberg, in solitude and free of life’s usual distractions, set to work on the problem with the single-mindedness of youth and the determination of genius.</td>

      <td>For the writer with an eye on the ‘plungers,’ racing was just one thing happening at the track.</td>
      <td>Damon Runyon wrote his first piece about horse racing in 1922, and led with an anecdote about boxing. Jim Reisler, the editor of a new collection of Runyon’s work as a turf hack, suggests that perhaps he was nervous, and so fell back upon that which he knew. I’m sure Mr. Reisler is right. Yet Runyon was bringing to the typewriter his own particular sensibility, in which heroes and villains were not isolated characters reducible to their roles. (Runyon, when he reported on Al Capone’s trial, enthusiastically recorded the gangster’s tailoring bills from Marshall Field’s, and the shopping he did for his home.) In the pages of “I Got the Horse Right Here” you will find yourself in gambling halls and hotels, perusing potential color schemes for racing silks and learning the multigenerational tale of the concessions ownership at Saratoga.<br />Sports writing at the time was wonky, detailed and serious, but Runyon was amused above all else. Racing was just one of the things that happened at the track. Anyone sentimental for a time when boxing and horse racing were main events will get a kick out of this collection. Runyon’s sense of the racing demimonde, though, promises deeper pleasures on offer.<br />Consider that concessions business. On Aug. 18, 1933, Runyon introduces us to the grandchild of Harry Stevens, the man who may (or may not) have invented the hot dog on a cold New York Giants opening day in April 1901. “A stout youth, with nice blond hair and pink cheeks, and a cheery, affable manner that reminds you, vaguely, of someone you know may be seen dashing at regular intervals from one end of the racing premises here to the other.” Runyon continues: “Now he is making an end-run around the mob of bookmakers in the clubhouse, now plunging through the throng under the grandstand, and now hot footing for the $1 enclosure, which is more exclusive than the sacred precincts of the upper clubhouse stand itself.” (It’s more exclusive, Runyon writes, because “you have to lay that one bob right on the line.” It is notable that despite regular coverage of the one- and two-dollar windows, Runyon himself was a plunger.)<br />Before we know it we are wrapped up in a story about how Harry Stevens came into his first substantial sum of money, when William C. Whitney, “former Secretary of the Treasury, founder of the present Whitney clan that is so powerful in racing, was the big gun of Saratoga racing.” After volunteering to do some investing for Stevens, Whitney asked Harry “how much money have you got?” Stevens gave him $25,000 or $30,000.<br /></td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans blocked the creation of a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, after GOP leaders urged colleagues to reject it.<br />The bill needed 60 votes to advance in the evenly divided Senate, thanks to the chamber’s longstanding filibuster rule. That means 10 Republicans would have had to vote with all 50 members of the Democratic caucus to allow the bill to proceed. Only six did, and the legislation fell short, with 54 votes in favor, 35 against and 11 senators not voting.<br />The six Republicans who voted in favor of proceeding with the legislation were Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska. All but Mr. Portman had voted to convict former President Donald Trump in February at his impeachment trial on charges of inciting insurrection on Jan. 6. Mr. Trump was acquitted.<br />Two Democrats weren’t present for the vote: Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Nine Republicans also didn’t vote, including Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Richard Burr of North Carolina, both of whom were among the seven GOP senators who voted to convict Mr. Trump earlier this year.<br />The Senate had been scheduled to vote on the commission Thursday but procedural delays on separate legislation forced it into Friday. Sens. Murray and Toomey said Friday that they had missed the vote because of family obligations, but they would have voted yes.</td>

      <td>People of African heritage have contributed greatly to Europe’s music, literature and more. But their achievements have long been overlooked.</td>
      <td>In 1472, two decades before Columbus sailed for the New World, so great was the demand for African labor in Portugal that the parliament urged King Afonso V to bar the sale of Africans to other European countries, especially to rival Spain, whose market for bound blacks was equally insatiable. By the mid-16th century, about 10% of Lisbon’s 100,000 inhabitants were Africans who had been brought to the city as slaves. At the time, 30,000 other blacks lived scattered throughout Portugal, whose overall population barely numbered one million people.<br />Portugal outlawed the importation of slaves in 1761, after its ships had delivered roughly 400,000 Africans in chains to the country. That is a larger number of slaves than the United States and its predecessor colonies imported from Africa during the entire history of slavery in America. To know this and to visit Portugal as an American today is to make two awful questions nearly unavoidable: Why did such large numbers of Africans make so little obvious mark on the long-term composition of the Portuguese population and its gene pool? And why has the historic record of African lives in the country remained so sparse?<br />Portugal, though a pioneer in the slave trade, is by no means the only country in Europe with a forgotten or effaced African past. In one surprise that bears this out, researchers have recently found strong evidence that there were at least two African crewmembers on a ship, sunk in 1545, in Henry VIII’s navy.<br />Olivette Otele’s “African Europeans: An Untold History” works to bring more of this past to public attention. The book arrives in a market newly awakened to its topic by the drama surrounding the marriage of Britain’s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, as well as by recent entertainment products, like the popular  Netflix  series “Bridgerton,” a royal period fantasy prominently featuring black stars.<br />Ms. Otele, a black scholar at Britain’s University of Bristol, takes a broad view of her subject. Sometimes, the African Europeans of the title are, as one might expect, people living in Europe, but on many other occasions, they are blacks or people of mixed-race who have lived elsewhere, in other far-flung quarters of the Atlantic world. Her book is equally sprawling in terms of time, moving back and forth across the centuries, from antiquity to the present.</td>

      <td>One of the most successful species on Earth, flies are the ‘ultimate evolutionary opportunists.’</td>
      <td>Gloucester’s lament in “King Lear”—“As flies to wanton boys are we to th’ gods; / They kill us for their sport”—isn’t cited in “Super Fly: The Unexpected Lives of the World’s Most Successful Insects,” but I suspect that the book’s author, Jonathan Balcombe, would agree with the sentiment deploring those sadistic youths. “Super Fly” is a lucid, absorbing and sprightly account of the world of flies. There is also a parallel story here, in which Mr. Balcombe becomes an outright advocate. His fervent enthusiasm for flies startled me, until I eventually understood his benevolent motives.<br />Here are some suggestive fly facts. In terms of “diversity and sheer numbers,” Mr. Balcombe writes, the fly’s success takes on “celestial proportion.” Some researchers estimate that there are 17 quadrillion flies on the planet. One British fly expert believes that for each human there are about 17 million flies. There are 160,000 known species of flies, and that’s probably “only scratching the surface.” Flies, which have been around as long as humans, exist on every continent, including Antarctica. A “handful of species have colonized the oceans—a habitat otherwise unreached by insects.”<br />Flies have an acute sense of smell: “Some carrion flies can detect a rotting carcass from at least 10 miles” away. Mr. Balcombe believes that flies possibly feel pain, have personalities and even possess consciousness. “They are master aerialists that can hover, fly backward, and land upside down.” He maintains that some flies, such as the blowfly, with its “gleaming metallic color,” could be said to “rank among nature’s most beautiful works of art.” To sum up, flies are “masters of adaptation,” Mr. Balcombe tells us, the “ultimate evolutionary opportunists.”<br />They have their good points as far as human beings are concerned, too. Flower flies are “vital pollinators.” Midge larvae “are an important antipollution brigade; in their multitudes . . . they filter algae and microscopic debris from the water.” Fruit flies have been indispensable to the analysis of genetics, having starred in more than 100,000 scientific studies. Certain fly species that infiltrate human corpses have helped scientists determine a murder victim’s time of death, thus assisting in homicide convictions and exonerations. Maggots can help heal wounds on humans because they eat only infected tissue; in fact, their tissue work is “far less expensive than conventional wound healing therapies.” Flies enhance the taste of Sardinian sheep-milk cheese. Some people even enjoy eating the cheese maggots—but the maggots can survive the digestion process and wreak havoc in the intestine, which, unquestionably, is not one of their good attributes.<br />Though a fly aficionado, Mr. Balcombe doesn’t stint from examining the dark side of the species. “Let’s face it, flies do not win popularity contests with us,” he concedes, and his scrutiny of the harm that some species inflict on humans, livestock and plants decidedly shows why. Flies are the most common carriers of insect-transmitted diseases. Biting midges “are known to transmit at least 66 viruses and 15 protozoans.” Sand flies spread oroya fever, which killed about 25% of Pizarro’s army in 16th-century South America. Tsetse flies transmit sleeping sickness. Tropical blackflies “can carry the roundworm that causes river blindness.” “Biting flies combine to make up the most damaging arthropod pests of cattle worldwide.” And so on.</td>

The U.S. began administering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to kids 12 to 15 earlier this month.<br />The EMA gave the green light after reviewing data from a trial in which none of the 1,005 children who got the vaccine developed Covid-19. Of the 978 who got the placebo, 16 got Covid. The results were similar to those from a trial in the U.S. concluded earlier this year.<br />Europe’s vaccination campaign has been accelerating in recent weeks, leading to a steep drop in infections and deaths.

Daily deaths are down by almost 70%, compared with six weeks ago.<br />In a sign of the advancing vaccination campaign on Friday, Italy said that beginning June 3 all people over the age of 16 can sign up to get vaccinated.</td>

      <td>Economist Thomas Sowell has grown accustomed to a certain type of media query, usually from white interviewers. They want to know how, as a black conservative, he has dealt with criticism from fellow blacks. Charlie Rose once asked: “How was it, though, for you . . . to be an African-American man respected by a cross-section of your peers and yet be so against the grain of fellow African-Americans?”<br />Mr. Sowell, 90, usually responds by challenging the premise. “I don’t know if we can say [that I go] ‘against the grain of fellow African-Americans,’ ” he told Mr. Rose. “You mean fellow African-American intellectuals. But I don’t think African-American intellectuals are any more typical of African-Americans than white intellectuals are of whites.”<br />In another interview, Mr. Sowell told C-Span’s Brian Lamb that black strangers regularly stop him in public and compliment his views: “When I checked out of my hotel this morning, the black security guard came over and said, ‘Are you Sowell?’ And I said, ‘Yes,’ and he shook my hand warmly and we walked—he walked me the length of the corridor and talked about this and about that. . . . So, it’s not Sowell versus blacks. It’s the black intellectuals.”<br />There is a long history of conflating the interests of black Americans with those of black organizations, black journalists, black academics and other elites. The media lazily continues to turn to these groups, from the NAACP to Black Lives Matter, as if they speak for all black people.<br />In December 1980, Mr. Sowell headlined the “Black Alternatives” conference in San Francisco. Its goal was to showcase the variety of perspectives among black politicians, intellectuals and civil-rights activists. “The people who were invited,” he began his keynote address, “are people who are seeking alternatives, people who have challenged the conventional wisdom on one or more issues, people who have thought for themselves instead of marching in step and chanting familiar refrains. . . . We have come through a historic phase of struggle for basic civil rights—a very necessary struggle, but not sufficient. The very success of that struggle has created new priorities and new urgencies. There are economic realities to confront and self-development to achieve, in the schools, at work, in our communities.”</td>

      <td>Golden State laws drive up prices at the pump, and the Biden administration aims to take them national.</td>
      <td>Tustin, Calif.<br />Before the Colonial Pipeline shutdown, the national average gasoline price had exceeded $3 a gallon for only two weeks since 2014. Yet in California, gas prices in recent years have rarely dropped below $3. They now average $4.18 a gallon—$1.14 more than the national average—and in recent months have increased more than prices nationwide. Why do California drivers pay so much at the pump? Blame a higher-octane blend of taxes and environmental regulations.<br />California has long imposed higher taxes on gasoline than other states, but in 2017 Democrats in the state Legislature raised the tax on each gallon by an additional 20.8 cents over three years. At the start of this year, California drivers were paying on average 63 cents a gallon in state and local taxes, compared with the 50-state average of 36.8 cents. California’s gasoline taxes are the highest in the country.<br />Democrats claimed the gas tax increase was needed to repair crumbling roads and bridges, but Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the proceeds to be directed toward projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as bike lanes and mass transit. The state Department of Transportation recently reported the gas tax increase will provide enough to finance only half of its repair needs.<br />The California Air Resources Board, or CARB, also imposes a de facto carbon tax through its cap-and-trade program. Since 2013, refiners, oil producers and manufacturers have been required to reduce emissions or buy credits to offset them. The program adds about 14.3 cents a gallon to the retail price.</td>

      <td>BACK IN 2018, we wrote a book called “Brunch Is Hell,” in which we declared the dinner party the cornerstone of civilization—and brunch its evil antithesis.<br />Unlike brunchers at a restaurant, we noted, dinner party hosts selflessly welcome friends and strangers into their homes, provide them with free food and in return ask only that no one spill wine on the Pomeranian. A dinner party, we said, is a safe space for the freewheeling exchange of ideas, where differences can be loudly debated and impromptu dancing is welcomed.<br />And a dinner party is, we said, “recess for adults”—a blessed break from the pressures, consumerism and information-blitz of the outside world. We hoped to convince more people to host dinner parties. Without them, we warned, society would surely crumble, like the crust on a reheated brunch quiche.<br />Well, here we all are, after an enforced yearlong dinner party drought, and…we told you so. Turns out, when you spend 13 solid months bingeing true-crime shows and fake-smiling through virtual meetings instead of actually getting together? It’s enough to leave even the most urbane and extroverted of social animals a little feral.<br />The good news? There’s light at the end of the foyer. As vaccines roll out, case counts dwindle and gatherings with someone other than your toddler’s pediatrician become sanctioned, we can begin to restore civility. One dinner party at a time.</td>

      <td>Americans returning to restaurants might notice that the people serving them are a bit distracted. The most likely explanation is that they are just really busy with a surge in customers and millions of open positions unfilled, but there might be another reason.<br />Quest Diagnostics  released its Drug Testing Index this week based on seven million U.S. urine samples and reported a big surge in marijuana use in 2020, up 44% from 2016. The workers who tested positive at the highest rate, some 6.3%, work in accommodation and food services.<br />The good news is that the share of people testing positive for other drugs was flat or lower. For cocaine, positivity was the lowest since 2012 at just 0.22% and amphetamine positivity held steady at 1.1%.<br />The appropriately named Dr. Barry Sample, Quest’s senior director of science and technology, said in a press release that, “as we see upticks in hiring and many employees returning to the workplace, it is important that employers consider workforce drug testing as a way to keep the workplace, their customers and the community safe.”<br />As an executive of a company that gets paid for those tests, his stance is unsurprising. But with marijuana now legal in 17 states and the nation’s capital and the leisure sector begging for workers, it might be time to lighten up, at least on people who carry your hamburger instead of driving your bus.</td>

The hackers took over an online account used for mass emails by the U.S. Agency for International Development and sent deceptive phishing emails that contained malicious links.<br />Although the attack appears to have been largely unsuccessful—most of the email messages were marked as spam, Microsoft said—investigators say it shows that the hackers behind SolarWinds aren’t going away.<br />“These attacks appear to be a continuation of multiple efforts…to target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts,” said Tom Burt, a Microsoft corporate vice president in charge of security, in a blog post.<br />A Microsoft spokesman declined to say how his company had linked the attack to the SolarWinds incident. U.S. government officials have said that the SolarWinds hack was conducted by Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, known as the SVR. Russia has denied that the agency was behind the SolarWinds attack.</td>

Much to her and my chagrin, I’m not, but her question had validity. I was, after all, sporting 5-inch heels, fishnets and a new shocking-pink satin shorts suit—one of my more curious purchases given that I’m a color-averse New Yorker. As I shook my head no, her father chortled. She grinned and grabbed his hand. I welled up behind my Saturn-size sunglasses. This overdressed grocery run was my first outing after recovering from Covid. I felt lucky, relieved, giddy and, apparently, I looked Lady Gaga-level fabulous.<br />According to Dr. Jennifer Baumgartner, a clinical psychologist in Washington, D.C., we humans use clothing to mark significant events, like making it through a global pandemic. And as U.S. cities reopen, friends reunite and the world becomes a smidgen less terrifying, women are reaching for exuberant outfits—like my I-survived-Covid pink suit—that proclaim “Woohoo!” and fete the occasion. I was admittedly ahead of the curve.<br />We’ve spent the past year in sweatpants, consumed by uncertainty, said Miami clinical psychologist Dr. Christina Ferrari. “You’re going to see a lot of people overcompensating for what they couldn’t wear” during lockdown.<br />Jeremy Scott, the creative director behind irreverent Italian brand Moschino, sees Roaring Twenties-style decadence in this post-sweatpants rebellion. I call it Joy Dressing, but whatever term you use, the phenomenon has been brewing since early February, according to Libby Page, senior fashion-market editor at luxury e-commerce platform Net-a-Porter. During the pandemic’s darkest days, customers were buying a “sea of very neutral tones and loungewear,” she said. What she’s witnessed selling lately: spirited prints, swishy tiered skirts and jubilant ruffles as well as “very bright, bold, colorful dresses” by cheerful brands like Zimmermann.<br />That label’s creative director, Sydney-based Nicky Zimmermann, has always produced upbeat, feminine looks (like the dress at right) and stayed the course during Covid. Her brand’s elevated U.S. sales suggest it paid off. “We can see that women want to go out and feel beautiful,” she said, adding that her lushly floral collection was conceived to lift spirits.</td>

Police said the mine consumed thousands of pounds worth of electricity (£1 is equivalent to around $1.40).<br />Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for  has become a lucrative business as its value has shot higher, peaking at about $60,000 per bitcoin in April. But mining the coins, where computers race to solve complex mathematical puzzles, is also hugely energy-intensive and very costly.</td>

      <td>Americans continue to spend more, but rising prices are cutting into how much they actually buy</td>
      <td>Americans spent more in April than they did in March—and bought less.<br />The Commerce Department on Friday reported that consumer spending rose 0.5% in April from a month earlier, which, coming after March’s government stimulus-check-fueled surge, was impressive. The gain was driven by a 1.1% increase in spending on services—an indication of how, with Covid-19 cases dropping and vaccination rates rising, consumers are shifting their behavior. Spending on goods actually declined, with the weakness concentrated in spending on nondurable goods such as groceries and cleaning products.<br />But a closer look at April’s overall gain indicates it was mainly driven by price increases. By the Commerce Department’s measure, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, consumer prices rose 0.6% in April from March, putting them 3.6% above their year-earlier level. As a result, real, or inflation-adjusted spending declined. Core prices, which exclude the often volatile food and energy categories to better capture inflation’s underlying trend, were up 0.7% from March, and 3.1% on the year. The Fed’s inflation goal is 2%, though it has said it will tolerate higher readings than that for some time.<br />The pickup in prices isn’t entirely unexpected, especially versus a year earlier, when the initial shock of the pandemic sent prices lower. But the supply-chain issues that have affected an array of consumer items from cars to kayaks continues pushing prices higher. As the economy reopens, there is a risk of a kind of rolling set of price shocks. Travel prices might jump over the summer, for example, as Americans make up for the vacations they missed out on during the pandemic. Then it might be clothing prices heading into the fall, as more children return to in-person schooling and adults go back to the office.<br />The Fed might well continue to look through any such price increases—after all, taken on their own, each would seem temporary in nature. Taken as a whole, however, they might be harder to ignore.</td>

      <td>Once his detailed tactical instructions are done, and after his last-minute audibles, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola likes to ask his team to remember why they became soccer players in the first place.<br />And before they can answer, he reminds them: it’s because they love to have the ball at their feet.<br />It might be a simple point, but it’s at the core of Guardiola’s attacking philosophy. Possession is everything. The surprising part is that it’s also at the heart of how his teams defend—Guardiola-ball has always been one long game of keep-away. “Maybe one day they will change the rules,” Guardiola joked to Sky Sports this season, “but I think to score a goal you need the ball.”<br />Yet even by Guardiola’s own standards, he has never had a defensive season quite like this one. The manager who built irresistible attacking machines, from Barcelona to Bayern Munich to Man City, has now added unrelenting defense to his arsenal. The club has conceded just seven goals in 12 games on its way to Saturday’s Champions League final against Chelsea, a career low for Guardiola. It’s facing just 6.3 shots per match.<br />“There’s been a slight shift season,” former Liverpool defender and CBS analyst Jamie Carragher said. “They’re a lot less predictable than what they were.”</td>

      <td>Tessa, the young divorcee and BBC producer who narrates Flynn Berry’s novel “Northern Spy” (Viking, 278 pages, $26), set in and around Belfast, Northern Ireland, wants nothing more than to enjoy the company of her adorable baby son. But her equilibrium is shattered when her older sister Marian, a paramedic, is caught on video participating in an armed robbery perpetrated by the IRA.<br />The police claim Marian’s been a revolutionary for years; she’s since dropped from sight. Tessa insists Marian is not political and must be a hostage. But in Belfast, years after the Good Friday Agreement, “bodies were still being found in peat bogs along the border” between Ireland and Northern Ireland. A preponderance of facts forces Tessa to accept the police version of the truth. But she’s still determined to find Marian, if only to express her rage at her sibling’s criminal behavior.<br />When the sisters finally manage to meet, the reality of Marian’s situation proves more complicated than Tessa imagined, and she resolves to extricate Marian from the cat’s-cradle in which she’s entangled. But the more Tessa assists Marian, the more she herself is coerced into committing compromising actions, and the more disoriented she becomes within a maze of moral conundrums: “It’s hard to say anymore which of us has Stockholm syndrome.”<br />Even at its highest pitch, Ms. Berry’s novel remains a human-centered story that closely examines the behavior of siblings, babies, mothers and friends. All the more shocking, then, when the curtain of domesticity is pushed aside to reveal the man in the black ski mask standing outside the window. Once the screws of suspense have been tightened, “Northern Spy” becomes a beguiling thriller that’s hard to put down.<br />Frances “Frankie” Croy, the English novelist at the center of Christine Mangan’s “Palace of the Drowned” (Flatiron, 306 pages, $27.99), flees to Venice, Italy, in 1966 after she’s physically assaulted a patron of London’s Savoy Hotel. This much-publicized attack (settled out of court) was the culmination of a breakdown brought on by Frankie’s obsession over an especially cutting review of her latest book, a critical and commercial disappointment.</td>

      <td>As we prepare to welcome guests back into our homes, interior designers share the most common décor goofs they see in foyers—and how to ensure those missteps don’t darken your doorway</td>
      <td>AN ENTRYWAY should feel like an appetizer on your way to the main course,” said New York City interior designer Laura Krey, one of the many designers who wonder at the neglect this key room often endures. Lacking an actual foyer is no excuse, said Lucie Ayres of 22 Interiors in Los Angeles. “You must figure out how to define an area that will welcome you and your guests.” Rugs, wallpaper and seats can delineate where walls don’t. We asked pros like Ms. Ayres for the irksome decorating gaffes they see most frequently, and for their seasoned advice on what to do instead.<br />“Life happens—shoes, bags, jackets and umbrellas get tossed by the front door without a second thought,” said Amanda Khouri, co-founder of design firm Murray Khouri in Nashville. That includes the detritus that Covid has littered our lives with, such as masks and sanitizers. Kristen Peña, of San Francisco’s K Interiors, noted that while we must stay safe, “it’s important that your entry has a more-welcome, less-E.R. feel.”<br />Instead: Take stock of your habits and clutter and you’ll be able to designate a place for everything without sacrificing beauty, said Ms. Khouri. Are your ever-present water bottle and yoga mat adding visual noise? Tuck them in large fat-weave baskets placed beneath a console or a closed storage piece such as an antique sideboard. To corral Covid supplies, said Ms. Peña, add a good-looking lift-top box to the entry table. Another solution, care of New Orleans designer Maureen Stevens: Ikea’s Hemnes shoe cabinet, easily made more stylish by changing the hardware, or adding color and pattern with stencil or even wallpaper.<br />One of the best ways to ruin the view of the beautiful room beyond your entry is “a huge, industrial-strength, waterproof doormat that would look more suitable on a loading dock,” said Carey Karlan, of Last Detail Interiors in Darien, Conn. Puny rugs don’t work either, said Samantha Gallacher, co-founder of IG Workshop in Miami Beach. They look like sloppy floor mats and don’t stay in place, she said.<br />Instead: “Large rugs in the entry make the space feel like it is designed and intended to welcome guests,” said Dallas interior designer Chad Dorsey. Ms. Gallacher suggests that the rug make a statement as well as introduce the design concept and colors reflected throughout the home. Ms. Karlan favors an Oriental rug. “The thick wool is very absorbent, they clean well, they don’t show dirt and they come in all styles, from contemporary to classic,” she said.</td>

      <td>Selected by Jim Shepard, the author, most recently, of the novel ‘Phase Six.’</td>
      <td>By Apsley Cherry-Garrard (1922)<br />1. In the midst of one of the worst stretches of Robert Scott’s disastrous 1912 expedition to the South Pole, Capt. Lawrence Oates, agonized at the realization that he was slowing the group’s progress and that the result would likely be fatal for everyone, announced his self-sacrificial death before heading out into a blizzard by remarking: “I am just going outside, and may be some time.” Fellow expedition member Apsley Cherry-Garrard was very nearly Oates’s equal when it came to poise in the face of disaster. Cherry-Garrard begins his chronicle of astonishing endurance in the face of extreme suffering by noting that “polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised.” In an environment of otherworldly ferocity—temperatures at times get down to minus-76 Fahrenheit—disaster is a continuous cascade and everything that can go wrong does. The group’s expedition is beaten to the South Pole by the Norwegians under Roald Amundsen. Cherry-Garrard must find and bury the bodies of his closest friends, including his expedition leader. Still, through it all, he carries on, never relinquishing his sense of wonder, evoking viscerally for the reader everything from the majesty of polar skies to the extraordinarily difficult lives of emperor penguins.<br />By Cecil Woodham-Smith (1953)<br />2. Cecil Woodham-Smith’s account of the charge of the Light Brigade—the disastrous British attack at Balaclava during the Crimean War—is unsparing in its detailed rendering of the privilege and arrogance and narcissism that led to one of the most stupefying blunders in military history. But in its rendering of the human toll, and the resiliency of the men who were so badly led, it’s spectacularly moving. When, in the carnage immediately following the charge, one of the officers principally responsible for the catastrophe rode about calling to his men that it had been no fault of his, one of them was reported to have called back, “Never mind, my lord; we are ready to go again.”<br />By Tom Simkin and Richard S. Fiske (1983)</td>

      <td>A summer visit unlocks a wonderful library in Juan Villoro’s magical tale.</td>
      <td>Metaphors we use about books take the form of real phenomena in “The Wild Book” (Yonder, 234 pages, $17.99), a magical-realist adventure for readers ages 9 and older by Mexican author Juan Villoro.<br />In his uncle’s labyrinthine library, 13-year-old Juan finds books that can poison and books that can heal; books that are in conversation with one another, books that steal from others and even books that form themselves into literal steps to lift readers to a higher level.<br />Juan discovers all this the summer he’s sent to stay with his uncle, called Tito, while his parents work out the terms of their separation. Tito is a mercurial bibliophile given to bold claims. (“Australia has the best ocean waves—not so much for their shape, but because they bathe the Australian female.”) Somewhere in his vast Borgesian stacks is a wild book that no one has ever managed to hold long enough to read. It becomes the quest of the summer to find this untamed volume, a pursuit made thrilling for Juan because he is joined in the hunt by a girl named Catalina, whom he adores. Translated from the Spanish by Lawrence Schimel, “The Wild Book” is as quirky and infused with the love of books as Tito himself.<br />“Watching grownups make wrong decisions you are helpless to stop—this is one of the worst parts about being a child,” Tricia Springstubb writes in “The Most Perfect Thing in the Universe” (Margaret Ferguson, 180 pages, $17.99), a tender and humorous novel for readers ages 8-13. The melancholy observation comes as 11-year-old bird lover Loah Londonderry is contemplating the poor choices of the people charged with looking after her. Loah’s ornithologist mother is off in the Arctic saving birds while Loah stays at home in a crumbling, turreted house with two elderly caretakers, the tart and thrifty Miss Rinker and her sweet-tempered brother Theo. Now Loah’s mother has canceled her flight home in order to track down a rare bird; a vindictive building inspector has started snooping around the house; and Theo has had a fall. It’s a stressful situation for a gentle homebody like Loah, especially when bad gets worse. Ms. Springstubb brings a light, deft touch to this sensitive novel that, like its protagonist, draws inspiration from the lives and ways of birds.<br />With “Da Vinci’s Cat” (Greenwillow, 278 pages, $17.99), Catherine Gilbert Murdock weaves a cat’s-cradle of a book. From chapter to chapter, the narrative strands intertwine and double back, creating connections between Rome in 1511 and a modern-day American suburb. The conceit here is that the Renaissance genius Leonardo da Vinci numbered among his inventions a closet that works as a portal for time travel—and is used by, among others, his cat. The novel’s action moves back and forth across 500 years. In the 16th century, 11-year-old Federico Gonzaga lives as a pampered political prisoner of Pope Julius II. In the present day, a girl named Bee encounters an exquisite sketch by Raphael of a girl who resembles her so exactly that the child in the picture has the same scratch on her neck. Impossible!</td>

      <td>Government in Germany to ask for forgiveness for atrocities against Herero, Nama people in the early 20th century</td>
      <td>JOHANNESBURG—Germany said Friday that it would ask former colony Namibia for forgiveness for what it now recognizes was a genocide of the local Herero and Nama people committed by its troops between 1904 and 1908.<br />As part of this official recognition, Germany will pay 1.1 billion euros, equivalent to $1.3 billion, for reconstruction and development projects in Namibia as a “gesture of recognition of the immeasurable suffering that was inflicted on the victims,” Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement.<br />The sum, which, according to a spokesman for Namibia’s president, could be paid out over 30 years, far exceeds compensations paid by other countries for colonial atrocities, although Germany says that the payments don’t constitute reparations.<br />“Our aim was and is to find a common path toward true reconciliation in memory of the victims,” Mr. Maas said. “One part of that is that we name what happened during the German colonization of what today is Namibia, and especially the atrocities in the period between 1904 and 1908, unsparingly and without extenuation. We will now officially call these events what they are from today’s perspective: genocide.”<br />That recognition and the connected financial offer follow more than five years of at times contentious negotiations between the Namibian and German governments over how to reckon with the deaths of at least 60,000 Herero and Nama at the hands of German colonial troops more than a century ago. Some were shot by soldiers, others driven into the desert without water or food, while thousands perished in concentration camps, where inmates were starved, beaten and worked to death.</td>

      <td>Life-sciences company  Illumina Inc.  is facing a labyrinth of antitrust hurdles on two continents as it seeks to save its planned $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail Inc., which is developing an early-stage cancer-detection test.<br />The deal, announced last September, could have important ramifications for cancer care and the future of both companies. It also has become something of a test for U.S. and European antitrust enforcers as they focus more on whether acquisitions of leading startups could slow innovation.<br />The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued the companies in March to block the deal. Since then, the European Union has added an element of intrigue by invoking a new policy to claim a say on whether the combination of the two U.S.-based companies moves forward.<br />A hearing Friday in San Diego could determine the course of U.S. legal proceedings. Illumina has separately mounted a legal campaign overseas contesting the EU’s jurisdiction.<br />San Diego-based Illumina develops and sells next-generation genetic-sequencing machines and the chemicals used in them. Grail, based in Menlo Park, Calif., was founded by Illumina and spun off in 2017. It has been developing liquid biopsy tests that examine blood samples for genetic signs of cancer, a product that, if successful, could have a significant impact in healthcare. Illumina says buying Grail back would allow it to scale up operations and expand access to the tests more quickly.</td>

      <td>The record pace of no-hitters in 2021 isn’t an aberration—it’s the product of a series of evolutions that have pitchers dominating</td>
      <td>After more than 120 years, baseball’s all-time mark for no-hitters in a season is in serious danger of falling. There have been six already in 2021—and it’s only late May. At this rate, baseball will match the record of eight by the All-Star break, reaching a number last seen in the prehistoric baseball days of 1884.<br />And at least batters in 1884 could be forgiven for whiffing: that was the first season pitchers were allowed to throw the ball overhand.<br />Hitters in 2021 can’t claim novelty as an excuse. They can blame the speed of the fastballs whizzing by them. Or perhaps it’s their home-run focused approach that’s failing. Maybe it’s because of the shift or sticky substances purportedly on some pitchers’ fingers<br />But the numbers are clear: hitting is going through a steep depression in 2021.<br />The season isn’t yet two months old, but even a small fraction of a Major League Baseball season produces a remarkable amount of information. There have already been more than 50,000 plate appearances and more than 200,000 pitches. It’s such a rich dataset that statistical oddities have been erased by sheer volume.</td>

      <td>These hiking trails on the Italian Riviera—newly reopened to foreign visitors—are designed to let you tune into both natural and man-made sounds, experiencing the Mediterranean as never before</td>
      <td>THERE ARE MORE glamorous ways to arrive in Portofino, I thought to myself as I sat on a backwards-facing seat on a bus full of masked Italian nonnas. Nevertheless, after a year of lockdown baking and gardening, I was grateful to be on the road again. In mid-May, Italy reopened its borders to tourists from other European countries including Switzerland, where I live. (Vaccinated tourists from the U.S. who arrive on certain flights are also allowed to visit without a quarantine.) In celebration of the reopening, I set out for the spaghetti bowl of hiking trails in the Parco Naturale Regionale di Portofino set along the Ligurian coast. But my plan wasn’t just to stomp around the parkland. I went to listen to it.<br />While the park, about 20 miles from Genoa, was established in 1935, the interactive elements—sometimes called didactic or sensorial trails—only came about a few years ago. QR codes on signposts link to your phone. Point your camera on the code and you’ll be flashed intel about flora or fauna or local history. This summer, those footpaths are set to become even more interactive and sensorial for a project called Suoni in Cammino, or Sounds on the Trail. QR codes will direct hikers to listen for birdcalls while art installations, guided “sound” treks and a series of live music performances at various points (on specified days) are also planned. Elisabetta Vitelli, a musician and artist, developed the project in 2019 in partnership with Il Bosco in Ascolto, the Cultural Association of Forest Listening. The intent, said Ms. Vitelli, was to support local culture and musicians, and to heighten hikers’ senses while they explore the trail.<br />Sensory and didactic trails are found all over the world (see “Feel Your Way,” below). They typically emphasize nature and less-hyped spots. Many arose from a need for parks to become more accessible for disabled visitors by offering various ways to engage with the landscape, pointing out the sounds of the flora and fauna, for example, or the fragrance of the trees, grasses and flowers. The intent was for handicapped visitors to utilize their other senses, but trails like this inevitably became popular with everyone.<br />The Parco Naturale di Portofino, which occupies the mountainous Portofino promontory, is just one segment of the 419-mile Sentiero Liguria trail. Divided into 30 segments, the Sentiero Liguria hugs the arc-shaped Ligurian coast from Ventimiglia at the French border to La Spezia pressed up against Tuscany.<br />At just under 6 square miles, the Portofino park might seem like an espresso cup of land compared with venti-size Big Bend and Yosemite, but it packs a punch. Fifty miles worth of trails wind through Mediterranean macchia leading to an abandoned 9th-century abbey, waterfalls and beach coves. The Sounds on the Trail installations won’t be ready until July 3, but on the two days I spent exploring the park I tried to tune in to the aural features of the place as well as the scenic ones.</td>

      <td>Iron-ore’s record prices are encouraging a wave of investment in mining ventures, with companies hoping to avoid a repeat of the previous boom a decade ago that ended in multiple pit closures and abandoned developments.<br />Chinese companies are pushing to build one of the world’s biggest mines in West Africa, while a clutch of smaller companies are developing new mines in Australia or reopening mothballed pits idled years ago when prices were low. Many are betting that demand for iron ore, used to make steel, will remain buoyant as governments world-wide inject billions of dollars into their economies.<br />The benchmark iron-ore price rose to a record $233.10 a metric ton this month, according to data from S&P Global Platts, as China’s steel industry cranked up output. The rally mirrors gains in prices of commodities, including copper and crude oil, which are also in demand as the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic gathers pace.<br />New iron-ore entrants see an opportunity to thrive because the industry’s biggest producers are behaving differently than a decade ago.<br />BHP Group Ltd.  and  Rio Tinto  PLC, the world’s two largest mining companies, say they aren’t interested in producing much more iron ore in Australia, which accounts for more than half the world’s trade in the commodity. The pair’s current investments, which are still worth billions of dollars, aim to replace output from older pits, and they expect better demand growth in commodities like copper.</td>
