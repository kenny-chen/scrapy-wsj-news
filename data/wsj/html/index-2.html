      <td>An interactive tour of the empty Vatican Museums offers the chance to experience the Sistine Chapel and other Renaissance treasures without the crowds.</td>
      <td>Typically, the Vatican Museums are a source of both pleasure and frustration. Amid the throngs, it can be impossible to achieve any kind of contemplative state to allow real absorption of their many artistic treasures. While we are limited to armchair travel because of Covid-19, the impressive virtual visits offered by the Vatican Museums create the pleasurable sensation of seeing these typically crowded halls all alone. Digital tourism also allows you to see a few of the many rooms normally closed to the public, such as the Niccoline Chapel with frescoes by Fra Angelico (1395-1455).<br />All told, there are 26 distinct areas within the Vatican, ranging from the Pinacoteca or painting gallery; to unexpected troves such as the Jewish Lapidarium, containing inscriptions from the Jewish catacomb of Monteverde; and the ethnological collection, spanning works from Africa to China and Latin America, primarily the product of missionary work. The Vatican Museums website offers unusual accessibility to all of them—with a short introductory video, text and photographs and, in many cases, virtual tours.<br />Among the most stunning opportunities these tours create is to see each of Raphael’s four Stanze, a suite of rooms created for popes Julius II (1503-13) and Leo X (1513-21), as one rarely can in person. On walls and ceilings, Raphael depicted historical and philosophical allegories, complex subjects glorifying the history of the papacy as well as forging connections between the Christian and classical, pre-Christian civilizations.<br />In the the Stanza della Segnatura (1508-11), the magnificent fictive architecture of Raphael’s “The School of Athens”—with its expansive vault referring both to ancient ruins such as the Basilica of Maxentius and to ambitious new constructions then under way, such as St. Peter’s—is engrossing in itself. So are the varied attitudes and poses of that fresco’s ancient philosophers and mathematicians—the work includes portraits of Bramante as Euclid and Michelangelo as the famously ill-tempered philosopher Heraclitus.<br />But if one looks immediately across from it, as the 360-degree photography allows you to do, you may notice that Raphael has created an implied visual continuity of the pavement from “The School of Athens” into the fresco opposite, known as the “Disputa.” Above the ground plane, where popes and church fathers congregate, Raphael creates a platform of clouds, surmounted by Old Testament prophets interspersed with martyrs, saints and apostles. While “The School of Athens” represents the entirety of classical knowledge, the “Disputa” represents theological knowledge in two realms, on earth and in the heavens. The conversation Raphael creates across the room bridges the two worlds of the sacred and the secular, part of the larger effort advanced by Julius’s papacy.</td>

      <td>Biden transition team has named acting agency chiefs to lead major government agencies until Senate can act</td>
      <td>President Biden took office on Wednesday with none of his cabinet agencies led by Senate-confirmed secretaries.<br />Anticipating delays in the Senate due to the unsettled control of the chamber heading into January and former President Donald Trump’s looming impeachment trial, the Biden transition team has named acting agency chiefs to lead the major government agencies until the Senate can act.<br />Federal law specifies that acting officials in cabinet-level positions must either be next in line for a position or hold a Senate-confirmed position. Another category of individuals who are eligible to serve as acting officials are those who have served as an “officer or employee” of the same agency for at least 90 days during the preceding year, at a senior-level pay scale.<br />Acting secretaries have the same powers as Senate-confirmed secretaries but are limited by law to serving 210 days. At the start of an administration, acting secretaries are allowed to serve an additional 90 days. And if there is a pending nomination, federal law permits an even longer term of service.<br />Nevertheless, organizations promoting good governance say it is critical to effective government to have Senate-confirmed nominees in place as soon as possible.</td>

      <td>Investors are hanging on to bonds that protect against inflation even as they sell other U.S. government debt, a sign many trust the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady even if the economy picks up steam.<br />The yield on the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security settled Wednesday at minus 1.049%, according to Tradeweb, compared with minus 1.032% on Tuesday.<br />The 10-year TIPS yield has climbed slightly from its record closing low of minus 1.115% set on Jan. 4 but not nearly as much as the yield on the regular 10-year Treasury note. That yield, a benchmark rate for borrowing costs throughout the economy, has jumped to 1.089% as of Wednesday’s close, from 0.915% on Jan. 4. Yields rise when bond prices fall.<br />Taken together, these moves suggest investors increasingly expect higher inflation, but not rate increases from the Fed, analysts said.<br />Over the past several months, market-based measures of investors’ inflation expectations have risen, based on the belief that a combination of coronavirus vaccines, increased government spending and continued support from the Fed will lead to a strong economic rebound this year.</td>

      <td>THE AMERICAN fashion industry is suddenly abuzz again. For today’s inauguration, President Joe Biden, first lady Dr. Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff have all chosen to wear the work of American designers or labels, including Ralph Lauren, Christopher John Rogers and Markarian. “These moments on Day One are so important for an industry that’s been so hard hit and impacted by the pandemic,” said Steven Kolb, chief executive officer of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. “By wearing these American designers, they’re not only boosting the business of those individuals, but they’re really boosting the $373 billion industry...We have a new administration that clearly is welcoming and wants to be supportive of our industry.”<br />Consciously or not, the color purple—which can be seen as symbolically marrying red and blue—is also a theme, with Ms. Harris, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama all favoring the color for today’s ceremony.<br />For today’s inauguration, the incoming first lady Dr. Biden wore a custom blue wool-tweed dress, coat and matching face mask by New York brand Markarian, which is designed by Alexandra O’Neill. Ms. Harris wore a regal purple coat and dress by Christopher John Rogers, a Black New York designer known for his striking use of color. Mr. Rogers was recently in the spotlight for crafting the structured blue suit worn by Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez in Vanity Fair’s December 2020 cover story on the congresswoman. Ms. Obama, whose fashion choices as first lady were breathlessly covered by the media and in the case of J.Crew, boosted sales of certain items, also chose a Black American designer for today’s inauguration. The former first lady wore a burgundy ensemble by Sergio Hudson.<br />At a pre-inauguration coronavirus memorial event last night, Dr. Biden and Ms. Harris also made strong statements in their choice of designer. Dr. Biden wore a purple dress, coat and a mask from emerging New York designer Jonathan Cohen, whose parents are Mexican. Ms. Harris wore a custom camel coat by Pyer Moss, a label founded by Kerby Jean-Raymond, a socially conscious Black designer of Haitian descent.<br />Ms. Harris’s stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, an art student with an interest in fashion, has gotten buzz on social media for her experimental looks. Yesterday she wore a cutting-edge skirt suit and tie by the American designer Thom Browne. For the inauguration, she wore a plaid embellished coat by Italian label Miu Miu.</td>

In her role, she will serve as a counselor to President Biden and as the tiebreaker in an evenly divided Senate.<br />Ms. Harris, 56 years old, was sworn in on two Bibles: one that belonged to Regina Shelton, whom Ms. Harris considers a second mother, and one that belonged to Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court justice, who inspired Ms. Harris to pursue law. Ms. Harris also used Ms. Shelton’s Bible when she was sworn in as California’s attorney general and U.S. senator. Ms. Shelton helped take care of Ms. Harris and her sister while their mother worked when they were growing up.<br />Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice, was selected by Ms. Harris to officiate her swearing-in ceremony. She was escorted inside the Capitol by U.S. Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, a Black officer who redirected a mostly white mob away from lawmakers as they were being evacuated during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.<br />For some in attendance, watching Ms. Harris’s historic achievement was personal.</td>

Former deputies on the list included the East Asia chief at the State Department, David R. Stilwell, and Matthew Pottinger on the National Security Council.<br />The list also included the former Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, Keith Krach, formerly of the State Department, and the Trump administration’s ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft. Earlier members of Mr. Trump’s team were also named, including John Bolton and Steve Bannon.<br />The list didn’t include Mr. Trump himself or his family members. Nor did it include his trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who forged a trade deal with Beijing.</td>

      <td>Pent-up children can reconfigure chic modular furniture—like the pandemic best-seller the Nugget—into forts and palaces, saving parents sanity</td>
      <td>WHEN RACHEL GEER’S kids started slam-dunking a basketball into a nearby plastic hoop with the sofa as their launchpad, she suppressed the urge to scold. After all, they’d been stuck inside for 10 months. Luckily for the Chapel Hill, N.C., business analyst, the abused couch was a Nugget, the sort of modular sofa designed for such debauchery that interiors pros are recommending to families with children.<br />Beyond their resilience, such pieces are masters of metamorphosis. Amanda Lantz, a designer in Carmel, Ind., appreciates Jaxx’s boxy Modular Kid’s Love seat and Ottoman ($159, brookstone.com) for its ability to transform into a table or sleeper for nap time. Also safely soft-edged, the Kinbor Children’s Sofa can be reconfigured into a table and four chairs. With any modular set-up, Ms. Lantz recommends sticking to durable performance fabric such as Crypton or Inside-Out: “The last thing you want is something kids can crawl all over where every stain is going to show.”<br />Kids can flip, flop and prod the Nugget, from a sofa to bed to fort without help from mom or dad. Also fueling its feverish popularity: washable slipcovers and dense foam cushions. In 2020, sales of the modular settee—launched in 2014 by Nugget Comfort, based in Butner, N. C.—shot up roughly 250% over the previous year, according to co-founder Ryan Cocca. There’s currently a 3-month waiting list. Available in 15 solid colors, the sofa can also jibe aesthetically with adult décor. “I was able to incorporate the Nugget into the den of my home without it looking like a kids’ toy,” Ms. Geer said.<br />Some modular sofas deliver higher style at higher prices.  Roche Bobois ’s  tufted and piped Mah Jong blocks come in a virtually endless choice of pattern, including Missoni’s signature zigzag (from $2,120 per cushion, roche-bobois.com). Designer Jamie Drake in New York relies on Pierre Paulin’s Dune Sofa, which can be reconfigured into hillocks and meadows for imaginative play and extra sleepover spaces (from $4,700 per piece, ralphpucci.com). “With the right modular furniture, kids can be left to their creative devices,” said Mr. Drake, “and when they’re not commandeering it the adults can sink in and relax.”<br />In intergenerational spaces, Ms. Lantz mixes mutable sofas with pop art and a shaggy rug to “make the room not feel so serious.” Another destodgifier: oversize floor pillows. As a bonus, “they work as extra fort-building material.”</td>

      <td>Inaugural poet Amanda Gorman brought former presidents, lawmakers and dignitaries to their feet as she read a poem that aimed to inspire after the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol. She delivered it standing outside that very building.<br />“We’ve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy,” she read. “And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.”<br />The 22-year-old from Los Angeles is the first National Youth Poet Laureate and the youngest poet to read at a presidential inauguration. Her mother watched from the socially distant, masked audience.<br />President Biden’s inaugural committee told Ms. Gorman on Dec. 30 that she had been selected for the role.<br />She said she approached the task very deliberately, first reviewing speeches given by abolitionist Frederick Douglass and President Lincoln and others who have spoken at divisive times.</td>

      <td>Plus, a critically acclaimed film, ‘The White Tiger,’ and more films and series to add to your queue</td>
      <td>Netflix is on a roll. Even up against a pandemic and increased competition from some of the world’s biggest media companies, Netflix managed to grow its rolls to more than 200 million subscribers. This week’s streaming selections speak to the breadth of the service’s programming ambitions: from the critically acclaimed (“The White Tiger”) and the family adventure flick (“We Can Be Heroes”) to international series popular with American audiences (“Lupin”).<br />(Netflix)<br />“We Can Be Heroes” is a film about a group of kids with unique, otherworldly powers—stretching their bodies, fast-forwarding and rewinding time, shaping water—who are enlisted to save the world from an alien invasion after their parents’ superhero crew is captured. It was an instant hit when it was released on Netflix on Christmas. It immediately started bouncing around the service’s top-10 list and has already been given the green light for a sequel.<br />The movie was written, directed and produced by Robert Rodriguez, a creative force behind adult hits like “Once Upon a Time in Mexico” and “From Dusk Till Dawn,” as well as all-ages fare like the “Spy Kids” franchise. Mr. Rodriguez says it got a lot harder to make family fare for traditional studios after 2005’s “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D” disappointed at the box office. But he says Netflix reached out, told him that these were the kinds of movies that subscribers were watching over and over again, and asked if he’d like to make something for them in that genre. He pounced.<br />Mr. Rodriguez says kids are used to being taken to PG-13 superhero movies that “aren’t really made for them,” but thinks it’s important for them to see kids like themselves in these roles on screen.</td>

He was sentenced in August 2020 to 18 months in prison on one count of stealing trade secrets.<br />Mr. Levandowski left Google’s self-driving unit, Waymo, in 2016 and helped start a company soon acquired by  Uber Technologies Inc.  Google parent  Alphabet Inc.  sued Uber in 2017, claiming that Mr. Levandowski stole thousands of confidential files before leaving Google. Waymo and Uber settled the lawsuit in 2018, but a judge in the case asked federal prosecutors to investigate Uber and Mr. Levandowski over possible trade-secret theft. He was charged by federal authorities with 33 counts of trade-secret theft in August 2019, but a judge ruled that he wouldn’t have to report to prison during the pandemic.<br />The pardon was supported by venture capitalist Peter Thiel and entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, who founded Oculus VR, according to the White House.<br />—Preetika Rana</td>

Some  McDonald’s Corp.  restaurant owners also attributed strong January sales to the recent checks, as did fine-dining chain Fogo de Chão.<br />Chris Elliott, the Tampa, Fla.-based owner of restaurant chains that include Beef ‘O’ Brady’s and the Brass Tap, said the second round of checks contributed to a 6.5% increase in sales this month compared with last.</td>

Chicken suppliers have pushed back in court, pointing to economic factors they said drove poultry prices.<br />Tyson said it reached the settlement with plaintiffs including direct purchasers, commercial and institutional indirect purchasers and end-user consumers. It didn’t admit any liability as part of the settlements and said the settlement is subject to court approval.<br />Tyson said “it believes that the settlements were in the best interests of the company and its shareholders in order to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation.”<br />The Tyson settlement doesn’t cover lawsuits filed separately by individual plaintiffs.

      <td>Congress should raise the top corporate rate to 28%, but only for the most profitable companies.</td>
      <td>With President Biden in office and Democrats controlling the Senate, you can expect the new administration to propose a new tax bill soon, including an increase in the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.<br />This bill will be easier to pass, and do less harm to the economy, if it exempts small businesses from the increase. Small businesses have been the hardest hit by the Covid-19 crisis, particularly in the retail and restaurant industries. By comparison, America’s largest companies have had fairly smooth sailing the past year. Many giants, including  Amazon  and  Home Depot ,  are actually benefiting from the pandemic.<br />Higher taxes on smaller firms would mean less investment in the part of the economy that has traditionally generated the most jobs. With nearly 11 million Americans unemployed, this shouldn’t be overlooked. On top of that, the Treasury wouldn’t have to give up much revenue. Nearly 90% of corporate income tax each year is paid by the nation’s largest 25,000 firms. The remaining 10% or so is paid by about six million smaller companies.<br />There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a small business. But one way the White House and Congress could proceed on corporate taxes would be to apply the proposed increase only to businesses with annual pretax profit of, say, $2.5 million or more. According to my analysis of data from the Internal Revenue Service, that cutoff would allow the Treasury to collect as much as 90% of the gain in corporate tax revenue envisioned under the current Biden plan. So about 25,000 firms would move from a 21% corporate rate to a 28% rate, while nearly six million smaller companies would see no change in their corporate income-tax rate.<br />But about 30 million owners of businesses, most of them very small outfits, would not be affected by an increase in the corporate tax rate because they run their firms as limited liability companies, partnerships or sole proprietorships. The owners of these “pass-through entities” pay taxes on their company profits through their personal income taxes, and many of them benefited from the Trump tax cuts a few years ago, particularly from the 20% deduction on qualified business income. The Biden administration and Congress would be smart to make sure that only the very largest of these 30 million businesses—say, those with more than $2.5 million in annual profit—lose this deduction. That would ensure that America’s largest and most successful companies, whether they are organized as traditional corporations or pass-through entities, pay higher taxes, while the overwhelming majority do not.</td>

      <td>The Senate erroneously asserted jurisdiction once, but dissenting members forced an acquittal.</td>
      <td>Now that Donald Trump is a private citizen, the Senate should dismiss the article of impeachment against him for lack of jurisdiction. The Constitution is clear: “The president . . . shall be removed from office on impeachment . . . and conviction”—not by the expiration of his term before the impeachment process is complete. It also mandates that “judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal and disqualification“—not or disqualification.<br />When the Constitution was written, several states allowed impeachment of former officials. The Framers could easily have included that provision, but they didn’t. They also explicitly chose to prohibit the British practice of trial by legislature—excepting only impeachment—and “bill of attainder,” any punitive legislative act against a specific person. The courts have held that the punishments prohibited by the Bill of Attainder Clause include disqualification from holding office. Moreover, the Constitution requires the chief justice to preside “when the president of the United States is tried.”<br />No former official has ever been convicted by the Senate, and only one has been impeached. Secretary of War William W. Belknap was indisputably guilty of numerous impeachable offences, to which he confessed as he resigned his office hours before the House unanimously impeached him in 1876. The Senate voted in favor of a procedural motion affirming its jurisdiction to try Belknap’s impeachment. But two dozen senators who believed he was guilty voted to acquit on jurisdictional grounds. A close vote nearly a century and a half ago doesn’t establish a binding precedent.<br />A more compelling precedent is the House’s decision not to impeach Richard Nixon. After he left office in 1974 to avoid certain impeachment and conviction, there was no movement to continue the process.<br />Beyond the constitution, there are strong policy and historical reasons an incoming administration shouldn’t seek recriminations against its predecessor. In some countries defeated former presidents and prime ministers are routinely prosecuted. America has lived more in accordance with President Lincoln’s message to the soon-to-be-defeated Confederacy: “With Malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds.”</td>

      <td>Now available to watch online, the Atlanta Opera’s in-person performances embraced Covid-19 restrictions as a creative challenge.</td>
      <td><br /><br />The Atlanta Opera has been one of the few American companies to perform live for in-person audiences during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last fall, using a custom-built, open-sided tent situated on a university baseball field and following rigorous coronavirus protocols, the company gave 17 performances of two one-act operas—Leoncavallo’s “Pagliacci” and Viktor Ullman’s “The Kaiser of Atlantis,” played on alternate days—as well as three concerts. The salaried Atlanta Opera Company Players—a dozen top singers who live in the Atlanta area—and the six members of its young artist program comprise the casts of all the company’s live and digital events.<br />Films of the live operas and concerts, plus some additional videos, are being distributed on the company’s new Spotlight Media platform , at various price points. “Kaiser,” which is available now, along with the “Mezzo Extravaganza” concert, demonstrates how imaginative direction can harness Covid restrictions for artistic effect.<br />Ullmann’s sardonic 60-minute opera, with a libretto by Peter Kien, was composed in 1943 in the Nazi “show” camp Terezín but not performed until 1975 (the creators were killed in Auschwitz). The circus-themed production is directed by Tomer Zvulun, the company’s general and artistic director, with scenic design by Julia Noulin-Mérat, costumes by Joanna Schmink, and lighting by Ben Rawson. It skillfully juxtaposes Holocaust references (mountains of discarded shoes) with the visual signals of our current plague era (masks and four movable booths with clear vinyl sides). Singers inside the booths wear no masks; outside them, other singers and circus performers, all masked, stagger through a seemingly toxic landscape. The despotic Kaiser’s reign has produced a land where life and death are equally meaningless. Drunk with power, he decrees a total war that will kill everyone, but Death, angry at not being consulted, goes on strike. As a result, the populace, afflicted by battle and disease, cannot die.</td>

He declined to comment further.<br />The company has already hired banks to lead the IPO, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bacchus Capital is Nordgold’s financial adviser for the possible offering.<br />Gold has fallen 8.5% since highs last August, but the precious metal is up 57% since the summer of 2018. That long rally has been fueled by ultralow interest rates, which make gold more competitive against yield-bearing investments, and as investors looked for havens amid the spread of the coronavirus.</td>

But in a world increasingly obsessed with tidy convenience, many view the chore of converting food waste into fertilizer for plants and gardens much as they do tending to kombucha scoby or committing to cloth diapers for their infants: too time-consuming, too “granola” and too plain icky.<br />Composting has “been perceived as this very stinky project that takes a bunch of time and only makes sense if you have a big backyard,” said Friday Apaliski, a San Francisco “sustainability concierge” who works with clients to make their homes more green. She believes that people “are starting to understand how truly phenomenal composting is.”<br />Indeed, new composting technology has emerged that makes the process easier, faster and more stylish. Some composting systems are now small enough to live on your kitchen’s countertop and sufficiently attractive that you won’t mind looking at them day after day.<br />And with houseplant ownership skyrocketing (compost is just as good for Instagramable succulents as for an old-time vegetable garden) and a growing desire to reduce methane-producing food waste, more Americans are trying the ancient practice out for themselves. Between 2014 and 2019, according to the 2019 Composting in America report, the number of American communities offering composting programs increased 65%. This summer, Vermont became the first state in the nation to make composting mandatory.<br />If you’re going to do it, why not do it as pleasantly as possible?

And his journey from poverty and from nothing to a successful entrepreneur was full of so many weird twists and turns that you don’t know where to sit with them at the end of the novel.”<br />Mr. Bahrani, who wrote the screenplay and directed “The White Tiger,” talked about getting to know his protagonist better while making the film.

      <td>IN MY DREAMS, my laundry room is airy and bright, with wooden folding tables and shelves with baskets to intelligently organize detergents, sewing supplies, my ironing board and clothespins. In other words, it would resemble a modest-size Apple store, except with a whole section devoted to orphan socks.<br />But the laundry room in my reality is a hellhole. It’s a tiny closet, actually, where space is so tight I can barely close the door on the stacked machines that I jammed in there. They hulk, stupidly, among other random items including the vacuum, an empty guitar case and a weird bed coverlet known as “the meat blanket” because its mottled pink-and-white pattern resembles a slice of Mortadella sausage.<br />Worst of all, though, is the washing machine, which smells like mildew because its rubber seal is a moisture trap—a defect I came to learn over the past eight years is common in front loaders, and in this model in particular.<br />So it was actually good news a few weeks ago when the washer broke.<br />“Mrmffk, grnnnn…faulty shut-off valve,” the masked repairman seemed to say through his N95 mask. He also managed to convey to me that fixing the problem would cost upward of $600—nearly as much as I paid for the machine when it was new.</td>

Investors should ask whether this is as good as it gets for a while.<br />The consumer-products giant on Wednesday reported excellent earnings for the three months through December. Organic sales, which adjust for currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 8% from a year earlier. The company raised its sales guidance for the full fiscal year ending in June to a range of 5% to 6% growth from 3% to 4% previously and boosted its share-buyback plans.<br />The maker of Tide detergent, Bounty paper towels and Charmin toilet paper has benefited handsomely from the coronavirus pandemic. And thanks to its diverse portfolio, even categories such as shaving and beauty, not natural beneficiaries of the stay-at-home economy, have performed reasonably well. Grooming, for instance, saw 6% organic sales growth in the quarter thanks to surging sales for appliances like electric razors as consumers continue to shun barbers.<br />Yet P&G shares were basically flat in morning trading and are down around 6% since P&G reported similarly stellar results three months ago. Investors rightly worry that sales of household staples will fall as the pandemic fades and that its shares remain somewhat expensive at 23 times forward earnings, according to FactSet.<br />Perhaps a bigger challenge for the stock is that it doesn’t look like a good fit for any post-pandemic market narrative. In a reflationary boom, it wouldn’t benefit from the likely rotation into value stocks and cyclicals. Under a stagnation scenario it might normally be attractive as a steady dividend payer, but its current 2.4% yield isn’t especially enticing compared with other consumer-staples companies at the moment—particularly food and beverage stocks:  Coca-Cola ’s  yield is 3.4%,  General Mills ’ 3.7%, and  PepsiCo ’s  2.9%.</td>

The coronavirus pandemic halted the 11-year economic expansion and drove up unemployment just as the typical American household was starting to enjoy sustained income growth. Americans were living longer—an improvement from a period when the opioid crisis eroded life expectancy—until the pandemic exacted a swift, deadly toll. One government official said life expectancy could decline by the largest amount since World War II once the government completes last year’s mortality figures.<br />Long-running demographic trends also have shaped the country. The U.S. is becoming more racially diverse. More Americans are obtaining college degrees. Women are having fewer babies, and the population is growing at its lowest rate in over a century.<br />After stagnating in the wake of the 2007-09 recession, America’s earnings gradually improved starting around the middle of the last decade. Median household income was $68,700 in 2019, up 6.8% from the prior year and the highest figure on record. The poverty rate that year dipped to its lowest level since the government began tracking it in 1959. Last year’s figures are expected to show disparities in whose incomes suffered, with some households being better off because of stimulus payments and extra unemployment benefits.<br />The stock market has marched to near-record highs, lifting the net worth of investors while leaving behind the nearly one half of Americans who don’t own stock. Consumer debt has climbed as families have borrowed more heavily to stay in the middle class.</td>

On Tuesday, rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported a fourth-quarter profit that was more than twice as large as year-earlier results and annual revenue that was at an 11-year high.<br />With its focus on wealthy Americans and big corporations and money managers, Morgan Stanley is less exposed to mass unemployment and small-business closures than more Main Street banks.<br />Stock- and bond-trading revenue at Morgan Stanley rose 32% to $4.22 billion.

Their survival is key for the region’s banks, which together have over €2 trillion on loan to them—40% of the lenders’ entire business loan books.<br />Overall, lenders have considerably cleaned up bad loans from the previous crisis, but many are still stuck with souring portfolios. They are also struggling to make money in a negative-rates environment.<br />Regulators fear a new—and potentially bigger—wave of defaults could send banks scrambling to cover losses. Weaker ones could require state help to survive. Andrea Enria, the head of banking supervision at the European Central Bank, has warned that bad loans in the eurozone could soar to as high as €1.4 trillion—more than during the aftermath of the financial crisis—if the economy contracts more than expected.</td>

If the British trench-coat brand can reduce the number of products it has to sell at a discount, profit margins should improve.<br />Burberry stock rose slightly in European morning trading, but it still has a long way to go to catch up with Prada. The Milanese label is the best-performing large luxury stock of the past 12 months, gaining 67%, while Burberry is one of the worst. Prada’s shares have traditionally been more expensive than its British peer’s, but the premium has skyrocketed in recent months.<br />There isn’t much hard evidence yet to justify investors’ faith in Prada. Earlier this month, the company said its retail sales fell 6% in the second half of 2020—better than Burberry’s latest numbers, but not by much. True, there are some indications that Prada is getting more attention on social media. It ranked fourth in a recent Citi Brand Heat Tracker, while Burberry languished in 14th place. The question is whether this will translate into meaningful market-share gains as more consumers emerge from lockdowns this year.<br />Investors may favor Prada because its operating margins have been high in the past, peaking at 27% almost a decade ago. The business hasn’t been that lucrative in years, but as the Italian label makes a bigger cut of sales from highly profitable handbags, shareholders may be betting it can return to those highs. Burberry, by contrast, has a heritage in clothing, where margins are lower. Takeover speculation could also explain excitement about Prada, although its controlling shareholder has said the brand isn’t for sale.</td>

      <td>Can we face a bear market even if the economy booms? Yes, but it would be rare.</td>
      <td>We keep being reminded that the stock market isn’t the economy. But then, is it possible for the market to go into a long bear run even if the economy booms? Yes, although there is little record of it ever happening.<br />U.S. stocks’ performance over the past year has been more than breathtaking. Even though the U.S. economy is in decidedly worse shape than it was before the Covid-19 crisis started, with millions of Americans still out of work, stocks quickly rebounded from their spring selloff and surged to new highs. Valuations have touched levels seen only in the years surrounding the dot-com bubble and in the run-up to the 1929 crash.<br />It is an apt example of how the stock market’s link to the economy can be as thin as tissue paper. Even the idea that stocks are pricing in an expected boom in the economy once the pandemic passes is looking pretty flimsy as stocks don’t just look rich versus analysts’ expected 2021 earnings but versus expected earnings in 2022.<br />If stocks can be so divorced from the economy as it struggles through the coronavirus crisis, they also can be detached from it when the pandemic lessens its grip. With another round of fiscal support looking likely, and vaccinations under way, economists have been marking up their economic growth forecasts for this year. There is no rule that says that should send stocks higher, though.<br />To some extent stocks might have done well not just despite the pandemic, but because of it. The big companies represented in the major stock indexes were, in large part, less affected than many small businesses. Goods sectors such as manufacturing, which are a bigger part of the market than of the economy as a whole, have fared better than services. So it might be businesses underrepresented in the stock market that are the bigger beneficiaries of a better economy this year.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—International tennis stars jetted into Australia last week from some of the world’s worst coronavirus hot spots. At the same time, ordinary Australians were prohibited from traveling between the country’s two biggest cities because of a small outbreak in one of them.<br />Australia’s tough border controls have been credited with helping the country to contain the coronavirus. Now, Australia’s decision to let hundreds of tennis players into the country ahead of the Australian Open, one of the biggest tennis tournaments in the world, is serving up a public debate on whether some people are getting preferential treatment.<br />“It feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth,” said Julie Land, 42 years old, who has been trying to return to Australia from the U.S. with her family and will have to wait until at least March for an available flight. “Cricket players, tennis entourages and celebrities seem to have no issues at all accessing Australia.”<br />How Australia balances the needs of athletes with anger from some members of the public could offer lessons for other global sports tournaments due to be held this year. Japan, another country with a low number of coronavirus cases by international standards, is scheduled to host the Olympics in July, after they were postponed last year.<br />The tournament is an economic driver for Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city. Last year, more than 800,000 people attended, and organizers estimated that about $300 million was injected into the local economy. Broadcasts of the tournament reached more than 900 million homes globally.</td>

The company also logged higher revenue from products, services and investment income than it did in the year-ago quarter.<br />As more people returned to medical providers for care that they had avoided or postponed earlier in the pandemic, UnitedHealth’s costs rose as well. Medical costs climbed to $42.08 billion, up from $39.28 billion in the year-ago period. Operating costs increased to $11.51 billion, from $9.3 billion in the previous year’s fourth quarter.</td>

      <td>A Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress, even with narrow margins, could open the door to some potentially transformative clean-energy policies</td>
      <td>The narrow Democratic Party majority in Congress might close the door on some of President-elect Joe Biden’s most ambitious clean-energy proposals, but it opens one up for tax-policy changes. That alone could supercharge the industry.<br />Tax and spending measures can pass through a simple majority in the Senate through a budget-reconciliation process, which is why many industry watchers are focused on it. Notably, there are tax provisions that passed the Democrat-controlled House in July but never made it onto the Senate’s agenda when it was Republican-controlled.<br />One such measure worth watching includes an investment tax credit for energy storage. Keith Martin, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, notes that the provision is well-developed and has momentum behind it. Today, energy storage qualifies for the tax credits only if it is paired with solar energy, and there are finicky rules to prove eligibility. Such rules have meant battery systems that exist solely for grid services, for example, were shut out entirely.<br />An investment tax credit for energy storage has been on the clean-energy industry’s wish list for years and is a potential game-changer. The lack of cheap storage remains one of the key bottlenecks to a grid that relies primarily on intermittent solar and wind energy. Though battery technologies have become cheaper over the years, tax credits would increase its competitiveness. A tax credit for stand-alone energy storage could translate to 16% growth in the U.S. energy-storage market, according to a Wood Mackenzie report from 2019. The Solar Energy Industry Association credits the same subsidy for allowing the solar industry to grow by more than 10,000% since it was enacted in 2006.<br />Another potential measure is a longer extension of existing renewable tax credits. While a stimulus bill passed in late December included one-year and two-year extensions for tax credits commonly used by onshore wind- and solar-power plants, respectively, the House infrastructure bill passed last year included a five-year extension for both. A further extension could be a relatively easy win given that renewable tax credits have a history of receiving bipartisan support. Experience has shown that longer visibility on tax credits allows the industry to grow without sudden stops.</td>

      <td>Spectrum auction will cost carriers about $95 billion, but payoff is uncertain</td>
      <td>Wireless carriers clearly believe their own press about 5G. And they are wagering a huge sum to prove it.<br />The latest auction of wireless spectrum licenses by the Federal Communications Commission ended on Friday with a total of $80.9 billion. Adding in an estimated $13 billion to $14 billion in clearing costs to help move satellite operators to new frequencies will bring the total bill for this latest auction to around $95 billion—roughly triple what many analysts had projected. All for the purpose of securing the necessary capacity for the latest standard of wireless networking known as 5G.<br />Much remains undisclosed at the moment, including how much each carrier bid for what slices of spectrum. But analysts agree that  AT&T  and  Verizon  likely paid the most—because they needed the most. A trio of brokers who published estimates on Tuesday averaged a guess of $22 billion in total final bids from AT&T and $42 billion from Verizon, including the clearing costs.  T-Mobile ,  which already has a strong 5G spectrum position thanks to last year’s merger with Sprint, is estimated to have spent around $10 billion. Full results from the auction aren’t expected to be public until sometime next month.<br />Winning the licenses is one thing; paying for them is another. AT&T currently has the fifth-highest dividend yield on the S&P 500, according to FactSet. It also has a pressing need to invest in its Hollywood operations that include the HBO Max streaming service. Doug Mitchelson of  Credit Suisse  wrote Tuesday that AT&T may need to find incremental asset sales to offset its spectrum bill, lest the carrier’s credit rating get downgraded to something close to junk status. Verizon isn’t under the same kind of pressure, but Mr. Mitchelson predicted that stock buybacks at Verizon are “now off the table for years.”<br />There also is the question of making 5G pay off. So far, the performance of those services hasn’t lived up to years of hype from carriers. A survey by UBS in October found that 5G ranked “among low priorities” of smartphone users—below that of battery life and other functions. Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson notes that 5G revenue forecasts aren’t going up just because the spectrum costs came in much higher than expected. Those carriers also will still need to invest the necessary capital expenditures to make use of the spectrum. “Winning” the government’s recent auction may turn into more of a Pyrrhic victory.</td>

      <td>Markets where vaccines are rolled out rapidly may be beneficiaries, but the greater impact could be on the laggards</td>
      <td>The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is finally under way. Markets are already showing that the speed of local rollouts matters quite a bit—but global vaccination campaigns will also ripple through financial markets in some unexpected ways, including in places that have successfully controlled the disease.<br />It is difficult to pin down the precise impact of vaccine deployment so far. In the past month, while the MSCI All Country World Index is up by 3.3%, benchmark equity indexes in Israel and Dubai, two places with among the fastest vaccine rollouts globally, are up by around 8% apiece. Clearly vaccines aren’t everything though: The Bahrain All Share Index is down a little more than 2% over the same period, despite a rapid rollout.<br />Markets where vaccines are rolled out rapidly may be beneficiaries, but the greater impact may be on the laggards. Hospitality, travel and bank stocks are key areas on which to concentrate.<br />The MSCI World Banks Index has clearly been a major beneficiary of vaccine-related good news this winter: The index’s gain since the beginning of 2020 still lags behind the broad MSCI World by 22 percentage points. But it has clawed back more than a third of the 35 percentage-point gap that existed in mid-October.<br />As deployment continues, the difficult question of whether some vaccines are more effective than others also will come to the fore. Late-stage trial data from Brazil suggest that the Sinovac vaccine, CoronaVac, met the World Health Organization’s benchmark for widespread use by a whisker, with an efficacy rate of 50.4%.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The coronavirus has torn through nursing homes in the U.K., as it has in the U.S., taking tens of thousands of lives. Now, the U.K. hopes it is turning the tide, thanks to a homegrown vaccine that has yet to be authorized elsewhere in the West.<br />More than four million of the most at-risk people in the U.K., almost 8% of the adult population, have been vaccinated with at least one shot of vaccine.<br />Among them are more than half of the frailest group of all: the 300,000 elderly residents of nursing homes who can’t travel to get a shot. The key to reaching them has been mobile vaccination teams armed with a shot developed by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC.<br />Together with a network of family doctors and vaccination hubs in sports centers, hotels and cathedrals, this shot has helped the country to stay on track toward a target of vaccinating its 15 million most vulnerable people by mid-February.<br />The government says the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has also been authorized in India, Morocco and some countries in Latin America, has been a game changer in reaching people tucked away in smaller nursing homes.</td>

      <td>Organizers of the Tokyo Olympics face a long list of obstacles as they attempt to carry off the postponed Games in six months—and the alarming rise in Covid cases around the world recently is only one of them.<br />Potentially bigger hurdles include the need to speed up Covid-19 vaccinations globally and in the U.S. and convincing a skeptical Japanese public to accept vaccines and welcome thousands of visitors from around the globe.<br />The International Olympic Committee and organizers in Japan last March delayed the Games from 2020 to 2021, a move that came about four months before the event was set to begin. They are now closing in on the same decision-making window for 2021, with last year’s problems still in play and a few new ones that have surfaced as the pandemic has continued.<br />Vaccinations—for the hosts, athletes and spectators—are a big topic.<br />Although Olympic organizers have said they won’t require vaccines for fans and athletes coming to the Games, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said he wants almost everyone in Japan vaccinated by the Olympics’ July 23 start. Japan has secured enough vaccines to inoculate all of its population, though none has yet received local regulatory approval and the country hasn’t started vaccinations.</td>

The group acquired the annuities unit in 2018 from  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.<br />Sixth Street, a former affiliate of private-equity firm TPG, has amassed one of the biggest pools of private capital on record.

Its base is pension funds and other institutional investors.<br />Talcott currently has more than $90 billion in liabilities and surplus for its approximately 900,000 customers.<br />Since the world-wide financial crisis of 2008, private-equity, asset-management and other types of financial firms have scooped up blocks of life-insurance policies and annuities, and even entire operating units, as insurers narrowed their focus and divested product lines. Ultralow interest rates have prompted much of the activity, hurting insurers’ profits. One of the biggest of the postcrisis upstarts is  Athene Holding Ltd. , backed by  Apollo Global Management Inc.  and now a large publicly traded insurer.</td>

      <td>The action comes under the Deferred Enforced Departure program that offers deportation protections and work permits to immigrants in the country without authorization</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—As one of his final acts in office, President Trump has authorized a program to give work permits and deportation protections to Venezuelan immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission, an action President-elect Joe Biden had promised to take during the 2020 campaign.<br />The designation formally known as Deferred Enforced Departure offers legal protections to any Venezuelan national present in the U.S. as of Jan. 20, 2021, for 18 months. That is likely to benefit at least 94,000 Venezuelans in the country without authorization as of 2018, according to the Migration Policy Institute, though analysts believe the current number is likely higher.<br />Mr. Trump’s move is seen as a form of pressure the U.S. government can use against Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan authoritarian leader whom the Trump administration has targeted with sanctions, a limited travel ban and other measures. In Jan. 2019, the U.S. officially recognized the country’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s interim president.<br />During the 2020 campaign, Mr. Biden said he would offer Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelan immigrants should he win the election, addressing a major ask of the Venezuelan-American community in Florida that he was courting. TPS is roughly identical to the Deferred Enforced Departure program in the protections it offers. DED is issued directly by a president, while TPS must be approved by the Homeland Security secretary.<br />Republicans and Democrats in Florida have been lobbying for the move—south Florida is home to one of the largest Venezuelan populations in the U.S.—and the White House has long waffled over whether to take the step.</td>

But in a briefing for reporters, they clarified earlier updates by revealing that the testing setback resulted from the combination of a malfunctioning sensor and how Saturday’s test was set up rather than design or production defects with the engines themselves.<br />Outgoing National Aeronautics and Space Administration chief Jim Bridenstine and some top aides emphasized that on top of probable schedule delays, extra testing could stress parts of the 212-foot rocket to the point that performing its mission could be problematic.<br />The agency didn’t give a timeline for a decision, though some of its internal safety guidelines suggest that typically a new test would be necessary to demonstrate reliability of the booster’s primary propulsion system.<br />The looming trade-offs over testing present engineering and political challenges for NASA as well as Boeing, even as new appointees in a Biden administration are expected to reassess the status of the troubled multibillion-dollar SLS program.</td>

I’m glad to hear it. My focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of North Carolina during this difficult time for our nation.”<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation began looking into reports in March that several members of Congress, their spouses or their investment advisers sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock after lawmakers attended closed-door briefings about the threat posed by the virus as it was beginning to reach the U.S. Some of those trades spared lawmakers as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses as stocks sank by mid-March.<br />Mr. Burr, who sat on two committees that received detailed briefings on the growing pandemic, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, which he had chaired, had sold shares of companies valued at as much as $1.7 million, which he owned with his wife. The sale saved the couple at least $250,000 in losses based on what those stocks were worth at the close of trading March 19, the Journal reported at the time.<br />Mr. Burr had said he made the trades based on news reports out of Asia rather than any inside information he had received, but he stepped down from his post as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee while the investigation continued.</td>

It also reflected Mr. Pai’s skill for navigating politically perilous rules for cellular networks, television broadcasters and big media mergers—topics about which the president often opined.<br />“It’s very important for the FCC chair to maintain its independence because otherwise, instead of putting your finger on the problem, you’re putting your finger in the wind,” Mr. Pai said Tuesday. “That’s not a good place to be for any independent leader.”<br />Mr. Pai, a Republican who spent years as a commissioner before becoming the first Indian American to lead the telecom regulator, will leave office Wednesday before the inauguration of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. The departing official oversaw a collection of networks that grew bigger, faster and more varied over the past four years.<br />The telecom-industry veteran took the top job in 2017 with a promise to cut red tape holding back network investments. He started by rewriting his predecessor’s rules governing internet privacy and net neutrality, a concept that encourages broadband providers to carry all lawful internet data alike. Many changes dismayed Democrats but withstood repeated court challenges, fulfilling the Republican official’s pledge to make regulations more predictable.</td>

One-third of small businesses surveyed between Jan. 4 and Jan. 10 said they would need financial assistance or additional capital in the next six months, according to the Census Bureau, up from nearly 25% in mid-November.<br />“It’s encouraging to see that kind of volume go out the door, especially knowing that it can only go up from here,” said John Lettieri, chief executive of the nonprofit Economic Innovation Group. But small businesses have waited for a long time for that lifeline and some that could have been salvaged have failed, he said.<br />The average PPP loan size was below $20,000 for first-time borrowers and below $75,000 for second-time borrowers for applications processed through Jan. 17, according to an SBA spokesman, a sign the loans were being approved for smaller businesses. Loan amounts are based on the size of an applicant’s payroll.</td>

      <td>Streaming giant tempers subscriber outlook with surprising cash flow projection</td>
      <td>All its years in Hollywood have clearly taught  Netflix  the value of tweaking the screenplay.<br />Wall Street’s script for Netflix has been simple to date: a singular focus on user numbers. And the streaming giant has clearly delivered on that recently, thanks in part to the pandemic that confined people to their homes. The company said Tuesday that it added a record 36.5 million paid subscribers in 2020, with fourth-quarter additions of 8.5 million subscribers beating its own projection by 42%. Over the previous five years, Netflix had averaged about 22.5 million paid subscriber additions annually.<br />But the unique circumstances of Netflix’s recent pace mean it is very unlikely to continue. Indeed, Netflix projected only 6 million subscriber additions for the first quarter, matching the low end of Wall Street’s forecasts. But the company offset the disappointment with the target of breaking even on a free-cash-flow basis this year, compared with its earlier projection of burning as much as $1 billion. The company even bolded a claim in its quarterly letter to shareholders that it believes it will no longer need to raise external financing for its day-to-day operations. Its shares were up more than 13% following the report.<br />The reaction suggests Netflix and its investors are ready to grow up a bit. The company has burned cash since 2013 in a race to build up exclusive content on the correct assumption that studios that produced top-flight programming would eventually create their own streaming outlets. That has played out vividly over the past 18 months with the launch of services such as Disney+, HBO Max and Peacock. New rivals also have cost Netflix access to popular comfort-viewing programs such as “Friends” and “The Office.”<br />Fortunately, Netflix now has plenty of popular shows of its own. Moreover, the company’s tenure in streaming gives it unique insight into what audiences actually want to see. Who else would have given the green light to a hit show with washed-up “Karate Kid” characters?</td>

      <td>Have the social-media platforms gone too far or acted too late? Students debate.</td>
      <td>Editor’s note: This week’s Future View discusses censorship on social media. For next week, we’ll ask students to make the case for one policy change that Joe Biden should prioritize in his first 100 days in office. Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Jan. 26. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Tell the Truth<br />There are three dominant narratives on the social-media censorship. The first is that social-media companies are private enterprises and should be able to censor speech as they deem fit. The second is that social media has become so vital to the exercise of speech that it has become part of the public square. And just as a town clerk isn’t allowed to deny a permit to a demonstration because he finds its subject matter objectionable, so too social-media companies must be constrained from censoring speech. The third also begins with the premise that social media has become highly influential, but concludes that platforms have a duty to stamp out whatever they (frequently progressives) find unsavory. That town clerk should take a stand and deny the permit.<br />I’d emphasize the private nature of social-media companies, and add that they should be held to their own standards. If they profess to be grand, benevolent platforms that are welcoming to all, then they should behave accordingly by allowing disagreeable speech to flourish. If, however, they purport to be platforms for progressive speech, then censoring conservatives is their prerogative. Content moderation is fine, as long as companies are honest with themselves—and us.</td>

      <td>By his own instincts, or the desires of his party’s progressives?</td>
      <td>Joe Biden begins his Presidency at a moment of deep political division, but paradoxically this gives him a rare opportunity. No doubt his Inaugural Address will echo his campaign theme of unity and healing, but his success in that mission will depend on resisting the divisive progressive domination sought by his party’s left.<br />Mr. Biden has been around long enough to appreciate the good fortune that has brought him to the Oval Office. Covid-19 accentuated Donald Trump’s leadership flaws and ruined the strong pre-pandemic economy. Mr. Biden was going nowhere in the Democratic primaries until Bernie Sanders emerged as the front-runner and the party turned to the former Vice President in political desperation.<br />Now as he takes office, the vaccines are rolling out and the economy is ready to soar once the Covid scourge eases. He will get political credit for the rebound simply by being there as the pandemic pall lifts. Unlike a Republican, Mr. Biden will also have nearly all of the media and the commanding heights of American culture behind him. A majority of Americans want an end to the furious rancor of recent years, and Mr. Biden is poised to benefit.<br />Left to his own political instincts, Mr. Biden could be the man for this moment. He is a moderate liberal with sympathy for the working class who is inclined to reach across the political aisle. With a 50-50 Senate and a narrow House majority, he also has good practical reason to do so. At 78 years old, he realizes he is likely to serve only one term and could create an admirable legacy as the man who calmed the Trump-era furies. That, at least, is our hopeful case for the Biden years.<br />Yet Mr. Biden also comes to power with a Democratic Party whose ascendant progressives have other ideas. Their goal is to use the federal government as a battering ram to drive economic and cultural “transformation.” Progressives in the House and Senate, urged on by the Democratic media complex and Silicon Valley, view the defeat of Donald Trump as the opening to assert a new level of government control over the economy and cultural dominance over American society.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump’s Presidency ends on Wednesday at noon, as the Constitution stipulates. One question to ponder is who will miss him more—his friends or his foes?<br />Our guess is the latter. And if you doubt it, consider the chat between Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton Monday on Mrs. Clinton’s “You and Me Both” podcast. They’re addicted to the man.<br />“I would love to see [Mr. Trump’s] phone records to see whether he was talking to Putin the day that the insurgents invaded our Capitol,” Mrs. Clinton said. The former first lady, who has never accepted the results of the 2016 election, is immune to the irony that in claiming he really won the election President Trump is following her pre-election advice to Joe Biden to “not concede under any circumstance.”<br />Mrs. Pelosi said during the podcast that she once told Mr. Trump that “with you, Mr. President, all roads lead to Putin.” She added that the Capitol rioters “were doing Putin’s business when they did that at the incitement of an insurrection by the President of the United States.” When Mrs. Clinton asked whether the country needs “a 9/11-type commission to investigate and report everything that they can pull together,” Mrs. Pelosi responded “I do.” Though she says she doesn’t know what it is, she suggested Mr. Putin must have something on him “politically, financially or personally.”<br />Maybe they should have a special counsel spend years investigating Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. Wait, they already did that.</td>

      <td>We have our policy disagreements with Janet Yellen, but there’s no denying she is a fine economist. So it was startling to hear her speak like a fact-hedging politician on Tuesday during her Senate confirmation hearing to be Joe Biden’s Treasury secretary. To wit, she did some on-the-fly editing of the economic literature to justify an increase in the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.<br />“Very minimal,” Ms. Yellen said in reply to a question by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott about the employment impact of Mr. Biden’s proposal to raise the federal minimum to $15 from $7.25. As evidence, she cited studies comparing employment in states that raised their minimum wage with neighboring ones that didn’t.<br />But those studies have yielded conflicting findings, and the economic literature overwhelmingly shows that raising the minimum wage reduces employment among teens and unskilled or inexperienced workers. Ms. Yellen acknowledged as much during a Congressional hearing in 2014 when she was asked about Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10.<br />“I think almost all economists think that the minimum wage has two main effects,” she replied. One is increasing pay for some low-paid workers, and the second is “there would be some amount of negative impact on employment.” How much is a matter of “considerable debate,” she said, adding that she “wouldn’t argue” with the Congressional Budget Office estimate that Mr. Obama’s hike would cost 500,000 jobs.<br />That impact won’t be “very minimal” if you’re among those who might have had one of those 500,000 lost jobs. And that number is likely to increase substantially if the minimum wage more than doubles to $15.</td>

      <td>Facebook and Twitter once positioned themselves as champions of an open internet. No longer.</td>
      <td>Social-media giants are under attack for censorship, but a few years ago they positioned themselves as champions of free speech. At issue was “net neutrality,” the Obama-era policy that treated internet service providers like  Comcast  and  AT&T  as common carriers—akin to the old Ma Bell monopoly—by prohibiting them from discriminating among content providers, including the social-media sites.<br />“Net neutrality is the idea that the internet should be free and open for everyone,”  Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerbergdeclared in July 2017 after the Federal Communications Commission’s then-chairman, Ajit Pai, moved to repeal the regulation, which the FCC had adopted two years earlier.  Twitter ’s  public-policy manager, Laura Culbertson, wrote: “Free expression is part of our company DNA. We are the platform that lets users see what’s happening and to see all sides. . . . Without Net Neutrality in force, ISPs would even be able to block content they don’t like, reject apps and content that compete with their own offerings, and arbitrarily discriminate against particular content providers by prioritizing certain Internet traffic over theirs.”<br />Facebook and Twitter turned out to be more threatening than under threat. Broadband providers haven’t attempted to block content or competitors since the FCC repealed net neutrality. But social media, app stores and cloud providers, which were never subject to the rules, all have engaged in censorship repeatedly in recent weeks.<br />Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat moved in lockstep to shut down Donald Trump’s accounts. Google and  Apple  banned the social-media app Parler, which promotes itself as a free-speech alternative to Twitter.  Amazon  Web Services booted Parler from its cloud, banishing it from the web until it could arrange service from another provider.<br />Appeals by big tech companies to protect an “open and free Internet” were always dubious. They had an interest in supporting net neutrality because it put them at an advantage. Among other things, the rule prohibited broadband providers from charging bandwidth guzzlers like Google’s YouTube, Amazon and Facebook more to upload their content at faster speeds.</td>

      <td>I now have an inkling of how the French must have felt when Allied troops liberated Paris in August 1944. Things were terrible; there was wreckage all around, and yet a sense of optimism must have been pervasive.<br />One part of our long national nightmare ends Wednesday as Donald Trump slinks off to Mar-a-Lago in disgrace, and Joe Biden takes over as president. Yet Mr. Trump leaves behind a second national nightmare: a raging pandemic and, largely for that reason, a sputtering economy.<br />When it comes to handling the pandemic, Mr. Trump has set the bar very low. Doing a better job than his predecessor will be a piece of cake for Mr. Biden. But “better” is not nearly good enough when record numbers of Americans are falling ill and dying. Mr. Biden must do vastly better. His comprehensive plans suggest that he will.<br />Public health is not my bailiwick, so I’ll concentrate on the economics. The national economy today is in passable shape given the unfolding health catastrophe, and the Cares Act of March 2020 is one major reason why. The law showed that Congress had learned two crucial lessons about fighting crises: Go fast, and go big. The Cares Act did both—and as a result it wasn’t as meticulously designed as it could have been.<br />There’s a third lesson: Don’t withdraw emergency support too soon. Mr. Biden clearly understands all three.</td>

Fear is the theme of this year’s inauguration week.<br />The Journal’s Alison Sider and Andrew Restuccia report:<br />For most people, air travel restrictions are not the most difficult of the government-imposed limits on liberty imposed in the time of Covid. Certainly they harm fewer people than school closures. And flight restrictions can be helpful, especially if the virus isn’t already spreading widely at the flight’s destination.

Remember, continuing to block visitors makes it harder to persuade other countries to admit travelers from the U.S.<br />Those of us who hoped that at some point a reasonable consideration of costs and benefits might somehow find its way into political deliberations on the virus have of course been disappointed.<br />For the most costly of the Covid rules, the search continues for a way to confirm the benefits.

      <td>For President Washington, holding public ofﬁce was a responsibility assumed, not an opportunity exploited.</td>
      <td>It ranks with the filibuster and the chaplain’s prayer among the hoariest traditions of the United States Senate: Every year since 1896, on or about Feb. 22, a member reads into the record George Washington’s Farewell Address. Washington’s prose, as honed by his ghostwriters James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, does not easily translate into the parlance of soundbite politics. But the dangers identified by the retiring president—excessive partisanship, sectional over national loyalties, misplaced allegiance to foreign powers—are as contemporary as the latest tweetstorm.<br />According to Stephen Howard Browne, a professor of communications at Penn State, the lawmakers may be listening to the wrong speech. To Mr. Browne it is Washington’s first inaugural address, delivered on April 30, 1789, that offers a classic defense of republican virtue as the linchpin of popular government. “I walk on untrodden ground,” the new president there acknowledged, his every action defining the scope of executive authority for all who would follow. In the years since, countless writers have retraced his footsteps, leading Mr. Browne himself to wonder: “Have we not had quite enough of George Washington?”<br />The question answers itself in this deceptively slender volume, in which Mr. Browne skillfully synthesizes biography, travelogue, social and political history, and rhetorical analysis to reach fresh conclusions about the relationship between individual and national character. Long before he took the oath of office on the balcony of New York’s Federal Hall, Washington had enshrined duty over self-advancement in his personal code. He demonstrated as much at the close of the Revolution, when mutinous officers in the Continental Army contemplated marching on Congress, until they were shamed out of it by their victorious general.<br />“That Americans have been spared the trauma of the military coup d’état,” writes Mr. Browne, “is owing in no small measure to a general insistent on the privilege of civil authority, who, wielding the sword in battle, laid it down in peace and left it there.” Can there be any stronger proof on this Inauguration Day of Washington’s continuing relevance? For him, no less than for his 20th-century admirer Dwight Eisenhower, the presidency was no promotion. On the eve of his investiture, fearing the toll of public controversy on his reputation, Washington confessed to emotions “as painful . . . as they are pleasing.” That he should nurse such feelings while being rowed across New York Harbor to the deafening cheers of his countrymen says much about this 18th-century idealist without illusions.<br />Hero worship exacted a high price, as Mr. Browne illustrates in tracking Washington’s triumphal two-week “inaugural journey” from Mount Vernon, Va., to New York City. Since visits from local notables would inconvenience private homeowners, the traveler opted to stay in “public houses” everywhere along his route. In Philadelphia, a massive parade ushered him down Market Street to City Tavern and yet another celebratory dinner, culminating in a toast (his 14th of the evening) to “government without oppression, and liberty without licentiousness.” The author enlivens Washington’s road trip with revealing detours into the president-elect’s spiritual outlook (he reserved his most fervent belief for religious tolerance and faith itself as a bulwark of public order); his attitude toward “the people”; and the seeds of American exceptionalism.</td>

      <td>Long-running battle involves concerns about racial and gender diversity</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday stepped into the middle of a long-running battle over federal limits on media ownership in local markets, weighing whether a recent regulatory rollback sufficiently addressed concerns about racial and gender diversity.<br />At issue was the Federal Communications Commission’s 2017 decision to loosen ownership restrictions by making it easier for one entity to own multiple TV stations in the same market. The rollback also repealed bans on common ownership of both a TV station and a newspaper in the same market, or a TV station and a radio station.<br />Some ownership limits had been in place for decades, to prevent concentration and preserve viewpoint diversity in local markets.<br />A federal appeals court in 2019 found the FCC didn’t satisfy its legal obligation to determine whether the rollback was in the public interest—because it didn’t adequately assess whether the changes would harm ownership of broadcast media by women and minorities. The FCC and a group of media companies, including  News Corp ,  owner of The Wall Street Journal, appealed to the high court.<br />During an hour-long oral argument, justices pressed both sides in the dispute, but several appeared sympathetic to claims by the FCC and the media companies that the old limits were outdated and didn’t take into account a changing media landscape.</td>

      <td>The left will try to convince Biden he has a mandate for progressive change. He doesn’t.</td>
      <td>When Barack Obama and Joe Biden entered the White House 12 years ago, the economy was in recession, unemployment was pushing 8%, and their fellow Democrats controlled the House and Senate. Sound familiar?<br />We know what happened next. Instead of focusing on economic growth, the Obama administration advanced an expensive but ineffective stimulus package and then went all in on a partisan transformation of the U.S. health-care system. The upshot was the slowest economic recovery since World War II. Democrats lost their House majority in 2010, and Republicans won the Senate four years later.<br />We’re about to find out what, if anything, Mr. Biden and his more liberal allies took away from that experience. Mr. Biden has said that his first order of business as president will be addressing Covid-19 and the economy. What we don’t know is whether the political left intends to let him do that. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party is much stronger than it was in 2009, and its members of Congress are far more numerous. Back then, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren did not command the national attention that they do today, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t old enough to buy beer.<br />On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden tried to put some rhetorical distance between himself and more radical proposals like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. It’s a strategy that obviously served him well in the election, but how well will it work for him in the White House?<br />When George W. Bush left office, his job-approval rating was in the mid-30s, and the incoming Obama administration interpreted Mr. Bush’s unpopularity as a mandate for its progressive agenda. That miscalculation cost Democrats control of Congress, and Republicans today are anticipating more such overreach under President Biden. Donald Trump didn’t lose re-election because he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement or prioritized securing the southern border or banned travel to the U.S. from countries with a history of coddling terrorists. Liberals who insist otherwise aren’t only kidding themselves but risk repeating the mistakes of a decade ago.</td>

      <td>Republican objection to fast-tracking Biden’s nominee suggests he won’t be confirmed on first day of administration</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Alejandro Mayorkas, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for Homeland Security secretary, told a Senate hearing Tuesday he would work to ensure that an attack like the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol wouldn’t be repeated, though his confirmation by Inauguration Day appeared to be delayed.<br />Mr. Biden’s team had named Mr. Mayorkas as one of a handful of national-security nominees it wanted confirmed on Inauguration Day because of continuing domestic threats. In 2017, the Senate confirmed both President Trump’s homeland security and defense nominees on Inauguration Day. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who is set to become the chamber’s majority leader on Wednesday, said on the Senate floor he hoped Mr. Mayorkas would be confirmed on Inauguration Day.<br />That timeline appeared less likely Tuesday after Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) said he would object to an attempt to fast-track the nomination. Mr. Hawley expressed concern about the incoming Biden administration’s plan to undo much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda, along with an expected push to create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million immigrants without a permanent legal status.<br />Mr. Hawley, who was the first senator to announce he would formally object to certifying the election results on Jan. 6, has faced a backlash from colleagues and donors since that day. Many Senate Republicans blame him for what they see as his role in instigating the riot that resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer.<br />Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Mr. Schumer met Tuesday to iron out details of a power-sharing agreement in a Senate divided evenly along party lines.  Under a similar agreement in 2001, nominees and bills could advance to the floor even if a committee vote tied.</td>

      <td>Chuck Norris’s whompin’ stompin lawman is turned into a soft-spoken hero encumbered by uncertainties.</td>
      <td>If you’re looking for whompin’, stompin’, kung-fu-administered rear-end alignments of the Chuck Norris variety, “Walker” may come as a surprise. It will be an understandable surprise: The show is a reboot, pun intended, of the old Norris vehicle “Walker, Texas Ranger,” in which acting, dramaturgy and plausibility took a back seat to the martial-arts prowess of Mr. Norris, the instant gratification that comes with bad guys being righteously thumped and the moral justification of violence, judiciously applied.<br />In “Walker,” Jared Padalecki (“Supernatural”) plays a far more nuanced edition of Cordell Walker, Texas ranger—lawman, father and widower, though not necessarily in that order; Walker’s priorities are poised to be a central part of the series’ plotlines and motivations. Where Mr. Norris was largely impenetrable, Mr. Padalecki is a wide-open book, riven with uncertainties, apt to make the wrong move. His Walker is established as something quite unusual: a law-and-order hero with no sense of authority.<br />This may well change, as only the pilot was available to review and, as with most new shows, the introductory episode is hampered by the task of having to introduce everything. That said, the show’s creator, Anna Fricke, might have done this more tidily. The opening moments of the first episode involve the death of Walker’s wife, Emily (Genevieve Padalecki), under circumstances that go unexplained, as do the man’s anguished cries when he hears gunshots over her cellphone while appearing otherwise paralyzed into inaction. The next thing we know, we’ve leapt ahead, to an evening in which Walker is late for his own welcome-home party, an event that provides some shorthand on the rest of the cast and their interrelationships, but not on where Walker’s been, why or for how long. He mutters something about “more than a month,” someone else later says “three months” but it’s hard to tell: All this soft-spoken Texas muttering may be regionally authentic, but it doesn’t help with the details.<br />Everyone’s mad at Walker, at any rate, especially his kids, Stella (Violet Brinson) and Augie (Kale Culley), since he seems to have disappeared right after their mother died. Not only has Mr. Padalecki’s character thus been cast as less than forthright and take-charge, it is suggested that he ran away at precisely the time his kids needed him. Rather than rush home to see them when he gets back from his mysterious mission, he parks his enormous pickup truck in a public park. Where he starts drinking. Only to be taken into custody by State Trooper Micki Ramirez (Lindsey Morgan), who, just coincidentally, is about the become a Texas Ranger and—gasp—Walker’s partner.<br />The moral grayness of “Walker” will give the show’s writers no end of material, especially since the series seems positioned to be family friendly, moralistic, vaguely Christian and averse to the kind of mayhem that distinguished the program’s predecessor: Walker does beat down one deserving, smart-mouthed drug smuggler, but then gets chastised by everyone including his supervisor (Coby Bell) and has to promise to be better. You have to ask yourself, what would Chuck Norris do?</td>

      <td>John Lurie’s new show is an odd collage of nature watching, storytelling and art instruction.</td>
      <td>Thirty years ago, John Lurie, the musician, composer, actor and personification of “downtown” New York—when “downtown” meant something culturally specific—had a television series called “Fishing With John.” It masqueraded, with little discernible effort, as a nature-sports program, but was really about Mr. Lurie and his “guests,” who were his friends and collaborators: Jim Jarmusch, Tom Waits, Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Dennis Hopper. The show lasted six episodes, but attained a cult following and is available in a Criterion Collection edition and on Criterion Channel.<br />Mr. Lurie’s new show, “Painting With John,” is a very different kind of show—part one-man chat show, part art class—albeit with a similar attitude toward TV genres. Talking into a camera like it’s a real person?, he asks. It’s so artificial. It’s so wrong. “People who can actually do it well?” he says in episode 3. “They’re probably sociopaths.” In fact, he says that the more shows he has done in the series, the better he’s gotten at it, and “the worse and worse person I’ve become.”<br />Clearly, the six-episode season is not out to seduce it’s audience with warmth and fuzziness, but the pacing, the insouciance, the music (Mr. Lurie’s) and the surprising vividness of the colors and the artwork make for a show that engages a viewer sincerely, even while being a semi-spoof: The first episode is called “Bob Ross Was Wrong” (meaning “Everyone can’t paint”). And though Mr. Lurie says he intended the show to be “educational,” he’s an intuitive painter and how can you teach intuition?<br />It’s the kind of question that leads him to tell stories—about his parents for instance, and how they never stifled the creative impulses of him or his brother and fellow musician Evan, who as a young child would assume a character such as Rin-Tin-Tin and “demand to have his dinner served to him on the floor in a bowl.” They never scolded him, but rather played along. (“Rin-Tin-Tin! It’s time for dinner!”) In ways both roundabout and very direct, Mr. Lurie is turning a show whose sensibility is casual into something instructive, without pedantry, or technical expertise: Each episode begins with Mr. Lurie crashing his drone (or seven, at one point) in an attempt to provide an introductory overview of the undisclosed Caribbean island he calls home. At one point he asks why’s he’s doing the show at all. “In fact, if you’re watching, turn it off.” I couldn’t oblige.<br />The show has three essential elements: island scenery; Mr. Lurie’s stories; and his various works in progress—paintings that combine mosaic-like fragments made of oil or watercolor and suggest Gustav Klimt with the delicate flora of a Japanese Edo-period landscape. The act of painting is absorbing in its delicacy; the programs in their entirety are haiku-like—short, seemingly spontaneous, but in fact precisely constructed. (It is a one-man show save for occasional appearances by Nesrin Wolf and Ann Mary Gludd Jones, who work for Mr. Lurie and perhaps live with him.)</td>

The financing brings Cruise’s valuation to $30 billion, Cruise said Tuesday, up from an estimated $19 billion in spring 2019.<br />GM is adding to its Cruise investment as part of the funding round and will retain a majority stake, a Cruise spokesman said.

Cruise for years has been testing driverless cars in San Francisco and plans an eventual robot-taxi service. It is also is exploring commercial delivery.<br />Driverless cars are expected to throw off troves of data for autonomous-service operators to capture, store and eventually monetize, analysts say.

      <td>New directive, aimed at a 2020 Supreme Court ruling, comes in the waning moments of the Trump administration</td>
      <td>The Justice Department has issued a memo that aims to limit the impact of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that protects gay and transgender people in the workplace, a last-minute attempt by the Trump administration to influence policy as President-elect Joe Biden begins assembling new leadership at the agency.<br />The Supreme Court’s June ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County said a bedrock federal civil-rights law prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The 6-3 opinion, written by a Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch, rejected the administration’s arguments that federal civil rights law provides no protection to LGBT employees.<br />The new memo, dated Sunday and sent by the acting head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, acknowledges the court’s ruling was sweeping, but says the department should not extend it further to areas such as housing and education, where longstanding gender-based policies on bathrooms and sports teams could come into play. The 23-page memo, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, also suggests that some employers could cite religious beliefs that would allow them to discriminate against LGBT employees.<br />“Unlike racial discrimination, the Supreme Court has never held that a religious employer’s decision not to hire homosexual or transgender persons ‘violates deeply and widely accepted views of elementary justice’ or that the government has a ‘compelling’ interest in the eradication of such conduct,” the memo says.<br />A DOJ spokeswoman didn’t have an immediately comment on the memo.</td>

Overall, Netflix signed up what it said was a record 37 million subscribers in 2020 and had a total of 203.7 million users when the year finished up.<br />The company’s subscriber count has roughly doubled since the third quarter of 2017, when it first exceeded 100 million paying customers.<br />The pandemic has charged Netflix’s growth as consumer cut back on a range of leisure activities—from dining out and vacations to visiting theaters and concert venues—to comply with lockdown orders and limit the risk of infection. With many people spending more time at home, streaming demand jumped, bolstering Netflix as well as its competitors.<br />The Los Gatos, Calif., company said it generated $6.64 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up from $5.45 billion for the year earlier and exceeding analysts’ forecasts. But profit decreased to $542 million, or $1.19 a share, from $587 million, or $1.30 a share, the year earlier. Analysts predicted $1.36 a share for the latest period, according to FactSet.</td>

      <td>Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte overcomes challenge but falls short of outright majority after dispute over economic plan</td>
      <td>ROME—Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte survived a confidence vote in the country’s Senate but fell short of an outright majority, weakening his government as it searches for a way to tame the Covid-19 pandemic and revive the economy.<br />The vote in the Senate was triggered by the decision of a small centrist party led by a former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to withdraw from the governing coalition. Mr. Renzi said he objected to Mr. Conte’s plans for spending more than 200 billion euros, equivalent to $243 billion, in European Union loans and grants to support the economic recovery after the pandemic.<br />Mr. Conte garnered 156 votes in favor of his left-leaning government and 140 against, with Mr. Renzi’s party abstaining. After falling short of an absolute majority in Italy’s 321-member Senate, Mr. Conte could struggle in the future when he seeks to pass legislation. The government previously relied on Mr. Renzi’s group for its Senate majority.<br />“We will have a weak government precisely when we would need a very strong one,” said Valentina Meliciani, an economics professor at LUISS University in Rome.<br />The government won a confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament on Monday, where it has a stronger majority. If Mr. Conte had lost the Senate vote he would have been forced to resign, paving the way to either a new governing coalition or a snap election, which opinion polls suggest the right-of-center opposition parties would win.</td>

Eleven officers suffered minor injuries in the incident, according to the officials, including a captain who was struck by a bottle.<br />Ms. James, who last week filed a lawsuit against the NYPD over its response to Black Lives Matter protests in New York City last year, said Tuesday that videos circulating on social media showed that officers acted too aggressively.<br />“Once again, we are seeing and hearing accounts of NYPD officers infringing on the rights of New Yorkers,” Ms. James said. “The images of officers using excessive force against peaceful protesters is alarming and cause for deep concern.”</td>

The complaint is among the first to charge multiple alleged members of the mob with conspiracy in connection with the events of Jan. 6.<br />Around eight to 10 people wearing helmets, reinforced vests and clothing with paraphernalia identifying themselves of the right-wing militia group Oath Keepers moved in a tactical fashion and forced their way to the front of the crowd, a video cited in the complaint shows.<br />During the breach, one of the members allegedly communicated: “We have a good group. We have about 30-40 of us. We are sticking together and sticking to the plan,” the new complaint said.</td>

They were provoked by the president and other powerful people and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday.<br />Mr. McConnell has said he is considering whether he would vote to convict Mr. Trump during his second impeachment trial, which will take place after Mr. Trump leaves office. The House passed an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump last week, focused on his statements encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol.<br />How Mr. McConnell votes will be central to whether enough Republicans join Democrats in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump. A two-thirds supermajority is needed to convict in presidential impeachment trials, meaning 17 Republicans would need to support conviction for it to succeed.<br />Some Republicans, though, have said they don’t believe that holding an impeachment trial for someone who no longer holds office is constitutional. Democrats will soon control a majority in the Senate.</td>

But Mr. Biden has already passed on an even greater opportunity. When  Facebook ,  YouTube,  Twitter  and Apple shut down competing social media; as banks declined to do business with President Trump; as pundits called for ostracizing all Trump administration officials from future employment; as CEOs at major American corporations rushed to decline commerce with people who dared voice their worry about the fairness of the presidential election, Mr. Biden could have taken the stage and shouted that enough was enough. He could have pounded the podium and told social-media companies to “stand down” and open their channels to all Americans again; scolded businesses that it isn’t “American” to close your markets to people with differing political opinions; declared that we don’t deny people who serve this country future employment because we see the world through a different political prism and demanded an end to self-aggrandizing attacks on the millions of our fellow citizens who voted for President Trump.<br />How could the social-media moguls and the Amazons, Citibanks and Targets of the world refuse such a request for unity? It would have been, and still might be, as historic a gesture as Abraham Lincoln’s call for unity as the Civil War drew to a close. But our newly elected president has done none of these things. If “great moments are born from great opportunities,” Mr. Biden is passing one up right now.<br />Todd M. Johnson<br />Edina, Minn.<br /></td>

This is the more significant reason for a result at odds with the popular vote.<br />The Electoral College “causes candidates to campaign heavily in ‘battleground states’ while ignoring those they think they are certain to carry or not.” Battleground states are entirely the result of “winner take all.” Take California—the most populous state and one that is overwhelmingly Democratic. Under “winner take all” it is a miracle that any presidential candidate, Republican or Democratic, campaigns there. If, on the other hand, electoral votes were allocated proportional to the statewide vote, essentially as in Maine and Nebraska, both candidates would spend a lot of time in California. Under a proportional allocation even the loser in California could garner a substantial number of electoral votes.<br />“Winner take all” is not part of the Electoral College nor is it to be found anywhere else in the Constitution. It is a creature of state law.<br />Finally, if even without the misconceptions one is still impelled to abolish the Electoral College, there is no reason to stop there. The Electoral College perfectly mirrors Congress, and the Senate should be the next to go.<br />John J. Ronayne</td>

Mr. Biden has called for eliminating carbon-dioxide emissions from the power sector by 2035, and Tuesday’s ruling would allow him to push toward doing so without first trying to repeal or overhaul a set of rules put in place by conservatives.<br />Power plant emissions have long been one of the top two U.S. sources of greenhouse-gas emissions, putting them in the crosshairs of attempts by government to address global warming. The rules vacated Tuesday were an attempt by the Trump administration to overhaul the first-ever U.S. rules on these emissions, the Clean Power Plan, put in place by the Obama administration.</td>

But it may be some time before they get much better.<br />Bank of America  executives on Tuesday suggested that the bank’s net interest income likely bottomed in the third quarter, rising about 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, and that the fourth quarter of 2021 will likely look much better than the first.  JPMorgan Chase  last week reported 2% quarter-over-quarter growth in net interest income, and expects a pickup in 2021 versus 2020. The two banks had reported 2020 declines of 11% and 5% in net interest income, respectively.<br />One reason for optimism, widely cited across banks, is how much cash banks can still shift into their securities portfolios. Even absent any pickup in loan demand, banks can continue to put cash generated by deposits into fixed-income securities that pick up more yield.<br />Still, the road to much improved interest income across banks isn’t straightforward. One challenge is that mortgages continue to be prepaid because of a surge in refinancing, which affects mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America cited this as having a significant impact on its net interest yield. Banks have so much cash to deploy that they can still make gains in yields net of this effect. But where mortgage rates go could be a huge swing factor.<br />There is certainly hope in the shape of the yield curve. Banks across the board noted the recent steepening of the curve, as long-term rates have risen, as a big benefit. For example, the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasuries is as wide as it has been since 2017. However, banks have reasons to be cautious about simply buying longer-term fixed-income securities, as this could cause them to miss out on future rate increases.</td>

      <td>The two leaders are negotiating rules for a 50-50 Senate as it prepares to take up Biden’s cabinet nominees and a likely impeachment trial</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the chamber’s top Democrat, Sen. Chuck Schumer, will meet Tuesday to iron out the details of a power-sharing agreement in a Senate divided evenly along party lines.<br />Georgia on Tuesday formally certified Democratic victories for its two recent Senate races, ensuring that Democrats will take control of the chamber for the first time since 2015. Democrats will formally gain the Senate majority once the three new senators from California and Georgia are sworn in on Wednesday afternoon, because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris wields a tiebreaking vote. The chamber already is moving ahead with the confirmation process for some of President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet nominees and is expected to hold an impeachment trial of President Trump, though its timing hasn’t been determined.<br />In the past, a 50-50 Senate has meant that while each party gets an equal number of committee seats, the majority party holds committee chairmanships and controls the agenda, setting the schedule for nominees and legislation to come to the floor for votes. When the Senate last had a power-sharing arrangement, in 2001, that meant that nominees and bills could advance to the floor even if a committee vote was tied. The arrangements this time around are still being negotiated, however, and it isn’t known what rules will be in place.<br />In addition to hashing out a power-sharing agreement, Messrs. McConnell (R., Ky.) and Schumer (D., N.Y.) will discuss a Covid-19 relief package and nominees, a person familiar with the matter said. Both Republicans and Democrats are looking to the 2001 arrangement as a model, this person said.<br />In remarks on the Senate floor at noon Tuesday, Mr. McConnell argued that November’s elections didn’t hand any side a mandate for broad ideological change.</td>

      <td>Shift would bring greater transparency and broader participation, LME says</td>
      <td>LONDON—The London Metal Exchange is proposing closing its open-outcry ring, where traders have swapped metals like copper and lead using shouts and hand signals for 144 years, in a bid to attract more financial players to its marketplace.<br />The LME temporarily closed the ring when Covid-19 ripped through the U.K. in March, judging the tight circle of red couches that dozens of traders crowd around to be a health risk. The exchange, owned by  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. , is now floating the idea of shutting the ring for good.<br />The ring began life when the LME was founded above a London hat shop in 1877, though its origins date to sawdust circles around which merchants bought and sold metals in the early 1800s, when they were in high demand as the industrial revolution gathered steam. It survived two world wars, the decline of the U.K. as the world’s leading industrial economy and the rise of China as the largest metals consumer.<br />However, the coronavirus pandemic may prove to be its undoing. Launching a consultation on the proposed closure Tuesday, the LME said electronic pricing had served the market well during the pandemic and would bring greater transparency around the way that prices are set.<br />The ring’s long-term survival in the face of electronic trading has long been debated. The LME had previously experimented with setting closing prices electronically on a small scale in the nickel market. Covid-19 prompted the exchange to run that trial across the gamut of metals and contract dates.</td>

      <td>The Trump administration concluded that China has committed “genocide and crimes against humanity” against the Uighur ethnic group, delivering a forceful condemnation to Beijing on policies that have so far failed to galvanize international action.<br />The determination, which was announced in a statement Tuesday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, accuses China of imprisoning, torturing and carrying out forced sterilization against the Uighurs, a Muslim minority group.<br />“I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uighurs by the Chinese party-state,” Mr. Pompeo said. “The governing authorities of the second most economically, militarily, and politically powerful country on earth have made clear that they are engaged in the forced assimilation and eventual erasure of a vulnerable ethnic and religious minority group.”<br />The Chinese Embassy didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese government has in the past denied mistreating the Uighur population, who mainly live in the Xinjiang region, and defended its program of detaining large numbers of Uighurs as necessary to root out terrorism and provide job-training.<br />Accusations of genocide by the State Department are rare, and the State Department declaration came on the Trump administration’s last day. Mr. Pompeo said that he arrived at the determination after a careful review of the facts.</td>

      <td>Justice Department alleges academic who appeared on CNN and NPR and met with U.S. officials received a salary from Iran</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Justice Department filed charges against an Iranian academic, alleging that he covertly drew a salary from the government of Iran while living and working in the U.S. as a professor, political scientist and Middle East expert.<br />In a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court, the government charged Kaveh Afrasiabi, an Iranian citizen with U.S. permanent residency, with two counts of acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Typically, first-time offenders receive well below the maximum penalty.<br />The government alleges that Mr. Afrasiabi has been receiving a salary—totaling at least $265,000—from the Iranian mission to the United Nations since at least 2007, and health-care benefits since at least 2011. During that time, the complaint says, he helped Iran shape its public messaging in the media and advocated Iranian government positions at the highest levels of U.S. government.<br />Mr. Afrasiabi made contact with numerous U.S. government officials without disclosing his ties to the Iranian government, according to the government, including an unnamed member of Congress and his staff as well as a senior official in the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.<br />Such consulting activity usually requires a public registration with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law designed to bring transparency to the advocacy work of foreign states. In recent years, the Justice Department has reinvigorated its enforcement of the foreign-agents law, charging a number of lobbyists, consultants, business figures and academics for failing to disclose their ties to foreign states or foreign income.</td>

      <td>Armin Laschet and his party hope to keep the boring times rolling.</td>
      <td>Germany took another step Saturday in its long transition to whatever will come after Angela Merkel, as the country’s largest party elected Armin Laschet as leader. As head of Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, Mr. Laschet is in pole position to succeed her as chancellor after October elections—for boring or worse.<br />This marks the CDU’s second attempt to find a political heir for Mrs. Merkel, after Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s ascent to the party leadership in late 2018. AKK, as she’s known, was Mrs. Merkel’s preferred successor but proved inept at managing tensions among factions within the CDU. A string of poor state election results for the CDU hastened her exit last year amid a ruckus over cooperation between some local CDU candidates and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).<br />With Mr. Laschet, the CDU is attempting the same policy strategy embodied by AKK. He represents continuity with Mrs. Merkel in almost all respects, from his timidity on domestic economic reforms to his sympathy for Russia and enthusiasm for closer economic ties with China. The party on Saturday again rebuffed Friedrich Merz, who ran against Mr. Laschet and against AKK in 2018 on a free-market reform platform. CDU convention delegates also knocked out foreign-policy hawk Norbert Röttgen.<br />It’s a bet that when they elect a new parliament this year, Germans will want more of Mrs. Merkel’s brand of wooly centrism. But if that turns out to be true, it will be by default. State election results and opinion polls suggest the CDU and its Bavarian sister the CSU remain Germany’s plurality party but with markedly diminishing support.<br />Meanwhile, German politics is drifting away from Mrs. Merkel’s breed of consensus. Despite winning a leadership election among delegates to the CDU party conference, Mr. Laschet’s soft foreign-policy views are increasingly at odds with prominent CDU figures who advocate a sterner approach to Russia and China. The Greens are on the rise as a mainstream center-left party on the back of their foreign-policy hawkishness and hostility to crony capitalism at home.</td>
