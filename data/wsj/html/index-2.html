      <td>Justice Department is expected to spare the prosecutor leading the Hunter Biden tax probe</td>
      <td>Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson plans to ask holdover U.S. attorneys appointed by former President Donald Trump to resign, officials familiar with the matter said, as the Biden administration moves to put its stamp on the Justice Department.<br />Exempt from the decision, however, are two top prosecutors overseeing politically sensitive inquiries, including Delaware U.S. attorney David Weiss, whose office is conducting a criminal tax investigation into President Biden’s son, Hunter, a senior Justice Department official said.<br />Another prosecutor, John Durham, is expected to remain as a special counsel overseeing a wide-ranging inquiry into the origins of the FBI’s 2016 Russia investigation, while relinquishing his position as Connecticut’s U.S. attorney, the official said. Former Attorney General William Barr named him special counsel in October. He announced the decision in December.<br />The Justice Department official said the resignation request applies to 56 U.S. attorneys, but their departures aren’t expected to be immediate. Justice Department officials have scheduled a Tuesday conference call with U.S. attorneys to discuss the transition, two officials said.<br />It is not clear whether the request also applies to Michael Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, who has been overseeing the sprawling prosecutions stemming from the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.</td>

      <td>Democratic impeachment managers set to argue that a president isn’t exempt from a trial just because impeachable actions occurred in the final weeks of the administration</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democratic impeachment managers alleging that Donald Trump incited an insurrection at the Capitol were set to clash with defense lawyers Tuesday over whether a president can be tried after leaving office.<br />The first session in the second impeachment trial of Mr. Trump will feature presentations from both sides over the Senate’s authority to hear the case, followed by a vote on the matter, which requires a simple majority and is expected to pass in the Democratic-controlled chamber.<br />The measure is expected to draw some Republican votes, as five GOP senators, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, have previously sided with Democrats on a question related to the constitutionality of trying the former president.<br />The House voted to impeach Mr. Trump last month, alleging he encouraged the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 as part of a last-gasp effort to overturn President Biden’s election victory. The article of impeachment points to a speech Mr. Trump gave at a rally preceding the riot where he urged supporters to “fight” and march to the Capitol.<br />Sixty-seven votes are required to convict Mr. Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats. Only a handful of Republicans have indicated they could vote guilty.</td>

The number of postings to the site has grown since hitting a low in May, though the pace of new openings has slowed in recent months, Indeed said.<br />Industries that recovered quickly from the initial shock of the pandemic have led growth in job openings, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed. Those industries—such as warehousing, construction and delivery services—have held steady over the course of the pandemic.<br />Meanwhile higher-wage postings in technology and finance have recently picked up. “I think those are sectors that hire based on where they see the economy going longer term.” Mr. Kolko said. “Restaurants, beauty-and -wellness jobs and hair salons will hire pretty quickly if demand picks up but also might lay off people quickly. Higher-wage sectors hire and fire more slowly.”<br />The Labor Department on Tuesday will separately release its job openings data for December.</td>

Futures for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index slipped 0.1%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts drifted down less than 0.1%.<br />Investors said markets are taking a breather following a broad advance in stocks and commodities. The recent rally has been fueled by expectations of a new dose of stimulus spending in the U.S., which could add impetus to the economic revival. That has helped pare expectations for turbulence in U.S. stocks, sending the Cboe Volatility Index down this week to less than 22, after the gauge surged to over 37 at the end of January.<br />“Very small downsized moves are a symptom of low volatility,” said Trevor Greetham, head of multiasset at U.K. investment firm Royal London Asset management. “Low and falling volatility is a bull market phenomenon. You do get quiet days.”<br />Expectations that the economy will revive this year have prompted money managers to bet stocks will continue to power higher, driven by sectors such as energy, banks and consumer companies that are sensitive to the growth.</td>

He discussed the plan with then-lead director Kenneth Duberstein and board member David Calhoun, now Boeing’s CEO, according to internal emails cited in the suit.<br />Around the same time, Boeing was publicly pointing to pilot and maintenance errors as important factors in the fatal plunge of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia, even as it was privately beginning work on a fix to an automated flight-control system implicated in that crash. The system, called MCAS, later also led to a second MAX crash in early 2019 in Ethiopia.<br />The new details, contained in a recently amended version of a shareholder lawsuit filed against Boeing’s board in Delaware’s Court of Chancery, included inner workings at the highest levels of the company as it became embroiled in one of the biggest corporate crises in modern American history. U.S. regulators late last year allowed the MAX to resume passenger flights, ending a nearly two-year grounding.<br />A Boeing spokesman on Monday said the company was seeking to dismiss the shareholders’ suit, which he said lacked merit. He said Boeing was dedicated to safety, quality and integrity and that the company’s senior management and board had engaged in “robust safety oversight,” including extensive reviews of engineering, airplane-development and production processes. He said Boeing had improved safety, quality and compliance since the MAX crisis.</td>

      <td>Reddit Inc. doubled its valuation to $6 billion in a new round of funding that comes as the social-media company has added users through the Covid-19 pandemic and more recently has gained attention for its role in the recent Wall Street trading frenzy.<br />Reddit on Monday said it raised $250 million in a late-stage funding round led by venture-capital firm Vy Capital. Previously it was valued at $3 billion after its last funding round in February 2019, according to PitchBook, a provider of private-market data. Current investors in Reddit also include venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and internet conglomerate  Tencent Holdings Ltd.<br />“It’s a good market to fundraise,” Reddit Chief Executive Steve Huffman said in an interview. “Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there’s an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year.” For example, advertising revenue for the company shot up 90% in the December-ended quarter from a year earlier, he said.<br />The funding for Reddit comes just weeks after upstart audio-chat social network Clubhouse raised fresh capital. Clubhouse was valued at $1 billion last month after securing $100 million in a funding round led by Andreessen, according to PitchBook.<br />San Francisco-based Reddit, founded in 2005, is known for its message boards on a multitude of topics, as well as its “ask me anything” digital town halls with celebrities, politicians and subject-matter experts. The company, which isn’t profitable, was sold to Condé Nast in 2006, and the magazine publisher’s parent, Advance Publications Inc., spun Reddit off in 2011 and remains a shareholder. The company has raised roughly $800 million since 2011.</td>

They make up roughly one-third of the more than 5 million Venezuelan refugees dispersed around the region, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.</td>

The Quad reformed in 2017 in part to address a rising China.<br />The Chinese embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

      <td>They already know the result, but they think it will hurt the GOP.</td>
      <td>The Senate on Tuesday begins the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, now the former President. Democrats say the trial is crucial to punishing Mr. Trump for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, but it seems more likely to do the opposite by acquitting him. It also looks like a needless partisan exercise that will further polarize America’s political factions.<br />As we’ve said several times, Mr. Trump’s actions that day and after the November election were disgraceful. He made false claims about a stolen election and later about overturning the Electoral College count. He also misled his supporters about Vice President Mike Pence’s solely ceremonial role in presiding over the vote count.<br />By rallying his supporters to march on the Capitol in the false hope of overturning the election result, and then refusing for hours to ask them to stand down, Mr. Trump tolerated an assault on a constitutional branch of government. Republicans who think this is impeachable conduct will get no criticism from us.<br />Yet the House impeachers don’t limit themselves to that charge. In their single and sloppy impeachment article, they accuse Mr. Trump of “incitement of insurrection.” This is a stretch, not least because Mr. Trump called on the marchers to behave “peacefully.” The House managers mention this only in passing in their trial brief. It is doubtful that Mr. Trump’s Jan. 6 remarks would qualify as incitement under the criminal code.<br />The assault on the Capitol was a riot, and a violent one, but it wasn’t an “insurrection.” It wasn’t a coup. Law enforcement was overwhelmed but it was all on the side of the Congress. Once the mob was dispersed, the Members returned to the House chamber to count the votes. There was never any chance that Joe Biden would not become President on Jan. 20, whatever the fantasies of Mr. Trump and his courtiers.</td>

      <td>How many jobs for the young and unskilled do Democrats want to lose?</td>
      <td>President Biden says his priority is creating new jobs and he wants “to grow the economy for all Americans.” But look at how the Congressional Budget Office sizes up his proposal for a $15 federal minimum wage. Phasing in this mandatory wage floor by 2025, according to the CBO’s new average estimate, would result in a loss of 1.4 million jobs.<br />The idled workers would be disproportionately younger and less educated, and CBO projects that half of them would drop out of the labor force. Prices would also rise for goods and services that rely on entry-level labor, “such as food prepared in restaurants.” The federal budget deficit through 2031 would increase $54 billion, CBO says, as the government spent more on unemployment benefits and health-care programs.<br />Low-wage employees lucky enough to keep their jobs would get a raise. CBO says 17 million workers would be “directly affected” by the $15 minimum, and poverty “would be reduced by 0.9 million.” This is not a free lunch, no matter how often Mr. Biden and Bernie Sanders say so. Those gains would come at a high cost for the young and unskilled who will have a harder time grabbing the first rung of the economic ladder.<br />Even those figures are a guess, since setting the minimum wage at a high of $15 would essentially put the country through an economic experiment. This would mean imposing the urban labor costs of San Francisco and Manhattan on every out-of-the-way gas station in rural America. The U.S. economy is made up of local and regional labor markets with prevailing wage rates that depend on varying standards of living, the kinds of employers, and the availability and skill of the workforce. Some 20 states have a minimum wage no higher than the current national minimum of $7.25.<br />The good news is that the $15 wage’s route through Congress looks bumpy. Mr. Biden told  CBS  he’s willing to push a $15 wage floor in separate legislation, but he doesn’t think it’ll pass buried in his $1.9 trillion Covid bill: “Apparently that’s not going to occur because of the rules of the United States Senate.”</td>

It shouldn’t be hard to meet the organization’s expectations. Well over half of its members “fail to meet the minimal standards of a free democracy,” according to UN Watch.<br />Last fall Cuba, Russia and China were elected to the 47-seat body. Moscow won its seat after poisoning opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has since been imprisoned on trumped-up charges. The Chinese Communist Party-sponsored genocide in Xinjiang wasn’t enough to stop its accession, though its margin of victory narrowed from previous years. Cuba’s long history of repression didn’t matter.<br />Like so many other U.N. institutions, the council also has a malign obsession with Israel. It has condemned the Jewish state some 90 times since its founding in 2006. No other country comes close. By UN Watch’s count, Syria and North Korea earned 13 and 35 condemnations. Russia and China? Zero.<br />Mr. Blinken at least acknowledged “that the Human Rights Council is a flawed body, in need of reform to its agenda, membership, and focus, including its disproportionate focus on Israel.” But these problems are endemic and predictable: Membership is based on a vote in the General Assembly, not on real standards of human dignity or freedom.</td>

Saudi Arabia, with U.S. assistance, has led a coalition to support the country’s internationally recognized government. Democrats and some isolationist Republicans, critical of Saudi conduct, tried and failed to force the Trump Administration to end its involvement.<br />Last week President Biden announced the U.S. would pull its assistance for “offensive operations” and cancel “relevant arms sales.” Mr. Biden paradoxically promised the U.S. still would help Saudi Arabia defend itself from Houthi attacks.<br />The State Department also appointed an envoy to begin a fresh push to end the conflict. Seeking a negotiated peace for a war that has killed nearly a quarter-million people is important. But in the Middle East, adversaries read unilateral concessions as weakness unless they are made from a dominant position.</td>

But the breach highlights the exposure of utilities to cyberattacks.<br />“Water systems, like other public utility systems, are part of the nation’s critical infrastructure and can be vulnerable targets when someone desires to adversely affect public safety,” said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri at a news conference Monday about the incident.<br />The hacking began on Friday morning at the plant in Oldsmar, a city of about 15,000 people in the Tampa Bay area, Sheriff Gualtieri said. Around 8 a.m., a plant operator noticed that someone remotely accessed a computer system he was monitoring that controls chemicals used to treat water as well as other functions. The computer system has a software program that allows authorized users to access it remotely.<br />The intrusion was brief, and the operator didn’t think much of it because his supervisor and others remotely access his computer screen to monitor the system, Sheriff Gualtieri said. Then at around 1:30 p.m. Friday, someone again entered the system remotely. A plant operator observed the intruder opening various software functions that control the water being treated in the system, the sheriff said.</td>

      <td>The Justice Department on Monday moved to dismiss a lawsuit against a onetime friend and aide to former first lady Melania Trump that had sought the proceeds of her tell-all book, in the latest Biden administration shift away from the priorities of the Trump era.<br />In a brief one-sentence order signed by the new acting assistant attorney for the Justice Department’s civil division, Brian Boynton, the agency said it “voluntarily dismisses this action,” filed in October against Stephanie Winston Wolkoff.<br />The lawsuit accused Ms. Wolkoff of violating a nondisclosure agreement she had signed with the government when she volunteered to serve as Mrs. Trump’s adviser in the early days of that administration. Ms. Wolkoff had argued the confidentiality provisions ended when the White House terminated her job, and that the suit was an effort to silence her.<br />Her book, “Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship With the First Lady,” described Mrs. Trump as aloof and seemingly unbothered by the president’s behavior and policies.<br />The lawsuit garnered criticism, including within the Justice Department, where officials questioned whether the White House is inappropriately using the Justice Department to protect former President Donald Trump’s personal interests, current and former officials have said.  It was one of several actions the Trump Justice Department took last year involving damaging disclosures related to Mr. Trump.</td>

      <td>Law firms representing victims of childhood sexual abuse say their claims hold up to scrutiny</td>
      <td>Law firms representing sexual-abuse victims accused the Boy Scouts of America’s liability insurers of trying to intimidate victims from seeking compensation as the youth organization moves closer to proposing a settlement plan.<br />Insurers affiliated with  Chubb Ltd. ,  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.  and other companies that wrote policies covering the Boy Scouts against legal liabilities have questioned whether some of those law firms filed poorly vetted claims about their clients’ experience, which the firms have denied doing.<br />The Boy Scouts, faced with sex-abuse claims, filed for bankruptcy nearly a year ago. The organization is near to proposing a chapter 11 plan that would set up a compensation trust for men who were abused as children. Abuse victims are counting on insurance policies from decades ago, when most of the trauma took place, to fund a big chunk of the settlement program.<br />In court papers, the insurers question if many of the 95,000 sexual abuse claims filed against the Boy Scouts are legitimate and are seeking to interrogate a sampling of 1,400 men to determine whether their claims stand up to scrutiny.<br />That would require permission from the judge overseeing the chapter 11 case. An informal group of law firms calling itself the Coalition of Abused Scouts for Justice said in a Friday filing that the questioning would potentially retraumatize the men and that there were safeguards already in place to unearth phony claims. The discovery request “serves no legitimate purpose at this time other than for purposes of delay, harassment and intimidation,” the Coalition lawyers said on the behalf of the victims they represent.</td>

      <td>Democrats seek to divide Republicans and see little downside. That may turn out to be a miscalculation.</td>
      <td>What do Democrats hope to gain from Donald Trump’s impeachment trial? A conviction could prevent him from holding federal office again, but it isn’t clear they benefit from keeping him off the ballot. They beat him in 2020, and his looming presence could impede a new generation of Republican candidates.<br />But a trial will galvanize and unify the Democrats. It keeps the hated Mr. Trump in the spotlight and distracts from the central issue dividing Democrats: How progressive will President Biden’s agenda be? Even more important, they expect the trial to split the other party. Divide and conquer—pit pro- and anti-Trump Republicans against each other, not only now but for coming elections.<br />To recapture Congress next year and the White House in 2024, the GOP needs not only to retain Mr. Trump’s voters but to add to them. Republicans seen as anti-Trump fear losing contested primaries. In the general election, Trump supporters could lose swing voters. For the Democrats, by contrast, trying Mr. Trump seems a low-cost gesture. The only price, they believe, will be a brief delay in approving Mr. Biden’s nominees and momentary distraction from his agenda.<br />This isn’t to deny the bipartisan outrage over the assault on Capitol Hill, or the Democrats’ genuine belief (shared by many Republicans) that Mr. Trump’s actions after Nov. 3 breached the bounds of constitutional propriety. It is simply to recognize that Democrats and Republicans are political creatures who must make hard-nosed political calculations.<br />Yet the Democrats may end up paying a higher political price than they anticipate. The trial won’t only delay Mr. Biden’s program. It will tarnish his image as a “unifier” eager to work across party lines. That identity will be much harder to sustain after Democratic senators vote in lockstep to convict Mr. Trump and push through a mammoth Covid relief bill without any Republican votes.</td>

      <td>The Taliban has given every sign that it will harbor terrorists again after April.</td>
      <td>On the list of crises confronting the Biden administration, Afghanistan has steep competition. Amid a pandemic, a superpower contest with China, and a scourge of domestic extremism, policy makers could be forgiven for missing the days when Washington’s biggest worry in the world was an insurgency in Central Asia.<br />Yet as much as the White House might prefer to set aside Afghanistan, the conflict there cannot wait. Thanks to the flawed deal the Trump administration struck with the Taliban a year ago, the Biden team inherits a ticking time bomb it must quickly disarm.<br />Specifically, the Taliban agreement committed Washington to withdraw all its forces from Afghanistan by the end of April—less than 100 days from now. In exchange, the Taliban pledged not to allow terror groups to use Afghan territory to threaten the U.S. or its allies.<br />The U.S. has upheld its end of the bargain to the point that only 2,500 American troops remain in Afghanistan.<br />The Taliban, on the other hand, has made no sign of splitting with al Qaeda. The U.S. Treasury Department warned last month that al Qaeda influence in Afghanistan is actually increasing under Taliban protection. Taliban officials now speak of hosting al Qaeda members as “refugees”—the same rationale they used to shelter the group before 9/11.</td>

      <td>He rolls back a Trump reform to increase access to treatment.</td>
      <td>Among the Trump administration’s last and best decisions was to allow almost all physicians to prescribe buprenorphine, one of the most effective treatments for opioid addiction. Previously, only doctors who had completed an eight-hour training course and obtained a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration could do so. Only 7% of physicians are certified to prescribe the drug, and more than half of rural counties lacked a single prescriber as of 2018.<br />President Biden had promised during the campaign to abolish the licensing requirement, known as the “X-waiver,” which President Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services moved to nix a week before he left office. After France eliminated a similar regulation, the number of patients receiving buprenorphine increased tenfold, and opioid overdose deaths dropped by 80% in four years. Yet to the astonishment of the medical community, the Biden administration abruptly reversed the change on Jan. 27, arguing it didn’t pass legal muster and the White House budget office hadn’t signed off.<br />We hope this about-face wasn’t political. But if the only issue is procedural, why not let the change stand until Congress passes legislation to regularize it? There is every reason to do so: Nearly 130 Americans die of opioid overdoses on an average day, and a bipartisan bill has already been proposed, with plans for reintroduction.<br />The X-waiver stems from regulators’ concerns about using buprenorphine, an opioid, to treat opioid addiction. There is no similar requirement for prescribing opioids to treat pain. As physicians who prescribe buprenorphine, we can see why treating opioid addiction with an opioid might invite concern. But it makes sense. Buprenorphine’s chemical structure allows it to reduce cravings for other opioids like heroin while decreasing the risk of overdose should patients relapse on them. Just as impressive, it doesn’t cause the intense euphoria of other opioids, and it is usually formulated in combination with naloxone, a medication that blocks buprenorphine’s effects if injected, making misuse rare.<br />Given busy schedules, intimidation stemming from the unusual training requirement, and DEA scrutiny of buprenorphine prescribers, convincing physicians to obtain an X-waiver is a daunting task. Hospitals are so desperate for more prescribers that some are paying physicians nearly $750 to complete the X-waiver course. The federal government has also tried to improve buprenorphine access by extending prescribing rights to nurse practitioners and physician assistants who complete 24 hours of training and obtain an X-waiver. Still, the need for the treatment far outpaces supply.</td>

      <td>A distinguished author’s search for Grandpa, a rafﬁsh ‘supplier of nightlife’ to a Maﬁa-run backwater in central Pennsylvania.</td>
      <td>Do we really need another Mafioso-in-the-family memoir? I mean, seriously, we’ve had books that could be called Mafia Wife, Mafia Dad, Mafia Son, Mafia Stepdaughter, Mafia Uncle, Mafia Dachshund, Mafia Goldfish—okay, well, I made up a couple of those, but you get the point. When Al Capone’s purported grandson publishes a memoir, and he has, I think it’s safe to say we’ve reached saturation.<br />Which is why I was surprised how thoroughly I enjoyed Russell Shorto’s “Smalltime: A Story of My Family and the Mob.” Even more so once I realized a more accurate subtitle for the book would be “Searching for Grandpa: Second-in-Command of the Johnstown (Pa.) Mob.” In other words, this is not Mafia history that will send Geraldo Rivera scrambling to open a Shorto family safe anytime soon.<br />And that, oddly, is part of the book’s charm. The author of well-received histories of Amsterdam and New York City, Mr. Shorto has produced something that feels altogether fresh, a street-level portrait of how his late grandfather helped build what amounted to a Mafia small business—or businesses, actually, everything from the numbers and rigged card and dice games (Grandpa’s specialty) to pool halls, a cigar store, bars, bowling alleys and pinball arcades. There’s a murder mystery here—there has to be, right?—but make no mistake, this is a spry little book about small business.<br />As Mr. Shorto tells it, he had only the vaguest notion of his namesake grandfather Russell “Russ” Shorto’s career until an elderly cousin buttonholed him and urged him to write a book. Mr. Shorto is reluctant—“not my thing,” he avers—but soon finds himself in a Johnstown Panera Bread, surrounded by a gang of ancient, white-haired wise guys dying to tell him about the old days. Grandpa Russ, it seems, had a long run as a mid-level Mafia bureaucrat, running a sports book and crooked card games among other things, until his drinking got out of control and the law finally came calling.<br />For Mr. Shorto, the challenge is Grandpa Russ’s personality, or lack of one. He was a quiet man and, despite all the Panera chats, remains a cipher for much of the book. The story opens up once Mr. Shorto goes in search of the public Russ, tracing his family from its Sicilian roots and cataloging his newspaper clippings and arrest and FBI records. What emerges is the gritty tale of a talented card-and-dice cheat who gets his break in the late ’30s when a buttoned-down Mafioso named Joseph “Little Joe” Regino, who made his bones in Philadelphia, marries into Russ’s family and opens a Mafia franchise in Johnstown.</td>

      <td>As the Senate convenes Tuesday to try Donald Trump for “inciting violence against the Government of the United States,” the big question isn’t whether he’s guilty. It’s whether the Senate has the right to try him at all.<br />Questions about the constitutional legitimacy of this impeachment are a good hint why the nation is moving further away from the healing and unity Joe Biden called for in his victory speech. Certainly the policies of the Biden administration will take the country in a new direction. But if divisions between Americans deepen, it will be less because of the policies themselves than the means used to ram them through.<br />Start with impeachment. Given the Constitution’s lack of clear-cut language on the issue, there are legitimate arguments for impeaching and trying a president who’s already left office. Surely, however, an honest debate would begin by at least conceding that one reason there are so many unresolved questions is that what we have in this case is so outside the norm.<br />It wasn’t until 1868, 79 years after George Washington’s first inaugural, that the nation had its first presidential impeachment, of Andrew Johnson. It took another 130 years until President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998. But in the space of 13 months, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has managed to impeach Mr. Trump twice, equaling all the previous presidential impeachments in U.S. history.<br />Both impeachments have been rushed affairs, the first launched by the speaker’s decree rather than a vote of the House. As Sen. Mitch McConnell complained that first time ’round, “the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is breaking critical precedents, denying the administration important rights that were afforded other presidents, and violating basic rules of due process.” This time is no better. The ranking member of the House Rules Committee, Rep. Tom Cole, points out that Democrats chose “to race to the floor with a new article of impeachment, forgoing any investigation, any committee process or any chance for members to fully contemplate this course of action before proceeding.”</td>

The legislation also expands the child tax credit, broadens child-care assistance and bolsters tax credits for health insurance.<br />It will be combined with pieces advancing through other House committees with the aim of getting through the full House later this month. Together, the measures make up President Biden’s $1.9 trillion aid plan, which Democrats are trying to push quickly through Congress.<br />“Our nation is struggling, the virus is still not contained, and the American people are counting on Congress to meet this moment with bold, immediate action,” said Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), the committee chairman whose panel will begin considering the bill on Wednesday.<br />Other sections of the relief plan will provide $130 billion in funding for K-12 schools, $40 billion for colleges and universities and $39 billion for child-care providers. Mr. Biden has also proposed offering funds for vaccine distribution, unemployment programs and state and local governments, among other measures.</td>

If the 150 people were tested, and all negative, yes, I would do that.”<br />The state’s new arts initiative is a baby step toward restarting live performances, with 300 free pop-up performances across the state that will begin on Feb. 20 and run through summer.

      <td>WHO officials say they are confident that the shot will prevent serious illness and death from the new South African strain, despite a recent study</td>
      <td>World Health Organization officials expressed confidence that  AstraZeneca  PLC’s Covid-19 vaccine can prevent severe cases of the disease, as well as hospitalizations and deaths, despite questions about the protection it offers against a fast-spreading strain of the virus first detected in South Africa.<br />The remarks followed a release of information over the weekend about a small clinical trial of the vaccine in South Africa, which prompted the government there to halt a planned rollout of the shot.<br />The preliminary data, which hasn’t been published in detail, suggested the vaccine may not prevent mild and moderate cases of Covid-19 from a new variant that has become the dominant version of the virus in South Africa and the broader southern African region.<br />The WHO’s director-general, Tedros Ghebreyesus, said the trial’s findings were “clearly concerning news,” but stressed that they came with “important caveats.”<br />Those included the small number of volunteers in the trial—around 2,000—and their relatively young median age of just 31 years. WHO officials and outside researchers said the trial was too small and its volunteers too young to draw clear conclusions about the vaccine’s efficacy against the variant, known as B.1.351, especially when it comes to preventing more severe cases of Covid-19. Younger people tend to suffer from milder versions of Covid-19 and experience severe cases less often.</td>

      <td>On his sophomore album, the British artist tries to reconcile his angry past with his hope for a more grounded future.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />The distinctive voice of British rapper Slowthai is simultaneously a squeak and a scream. It’s as if the 26-year-old MC, born Tyron Frampton, knows that making his vocal tone slightly annoying will also make it impossible to ignore. His moniker is unrelated to his ethnicity—Mr. Frampton grew up being called Ty in council estates in and around Northampton, England, and he spoke slowly; his roots are Irish, English and Barbadian. And he will never be mistaken for an American—his accent is thick, and some of his slang is incomprehensible to non-Brits. But if certain phrases are hard to make out and some images difficult to decode, the deeper meaning of his music is clear: It’s fueled by anger, while keeping open the possibility of redemption.<br />In 2019, when Slowthai released his debut LP, “Nothing Great About Britain,” that rage was directed at the political situation in the U.K., specifically the country’s pending exit from the European Union. He vented about income disparity and violent street life, but leavened his grimy tales with moments of optimism. He called his tour the “Brexit Bandit,” and in his homeland he became a star as his album was nominated for the Mercury Prize and hit the U.K. Top 10. But he remains a promising curiosity in the U.S., respected by his American peers and more dedicated fans of global hip-hop but obscure to the mainstream. His new record, “Tyron” (AWGE/Interscope/Method), comes out Friday and is unlikely to make a big commercial splash on these shores. But it’s an excellent collection of songs that builds on and broadens the sound of its predecessor while maintaining the artist’s essential identity.</td>

      <td>Nonpartisan study says raising minimum wage would cost 1.4 million jobs but lift 900,000 people above the poverty line</td>
      <td>Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 could deliver raises for 27 million workers and lift 900,000 Americans above the poverty threshold—but the policy would cost 1.4 million Americans their jobs over the next four years, according to a study released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office Monday.<br />President Biden and many Democrats are pursuing legislation to more than double the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour in phases, saying it would lift many low-wage workers out of poverty and deliver pay increases to many essential employees during the coronavirus pandemic, including workers at grocery stores, warehouses and in delivery vans. Republicans and some businesses and economists have warned that such an increase could cost jobs as the U.S. recovers from pandemic layoffs.<br />While the CBO study finds poverty-reducing effects, its broader findings could make it difficult for proponents of an increase to rally enough votes among moderate Democrats and Republicans in Congress to raise the federal minimum wage for the first time since 2009.<br />The study reaffirms a finding that a $15 minimum wage could cost the U.S. jobs, slightly increasing a job-loss estimate from a widely cited 2019 CBO study. While many Americas would see raises, the analysis showed a minimum-wage increase would cause prices to rise, the federal budget deficit to widen and overall economic output to slightly decrease over the next decade.<br />Whether to include the minimum-wage increase in the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package has divided Democrats, who can’t afford to lose a single vote in the evenly split Senate. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) has publicly said he is opposed to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, while progressive lawmakers have pushed for the increase.</td>

      <td>Elon Musk’s bitcoin purchase for Tesla is another warning for investors in the wake of GameStop mania</td>
      <td>GameStop  mania was a wake-up call, but now the capital markets have truly reached ludicrous mode.<br />Electric-car maker  Tesla  said in a securities filing Monday that it has purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and that it expects to begin accepting payment in the cryptocurrency for its products in the future. Tesla shares and bitcoin both traded higher after the announcement. This follows social media posts by the auto maker’s influential boss, Elon Musk, that already had helped drive bitcoin’s price to a record. All told, the rally spurred by the announcement on Monday added more than $100 billion to bitcoin’s market value, while Tesla shares also rose yet again.<br />The investment is more than symbolic for the company, being equivalent to Tesla’s research-and-development tab for 2020. And while uniting two of the most popular investment themes under one roof is undoubtedly a winner today, the decision introduces even more risk to owning what is already one of the most speculative stocks of the current bull market.<br />As Tesla itself said in the filing, prices for digital assets such as bitcoin have been volatile in the past. Cryptocurrencies are a fairly recent development and their long-term adoption by consumers, investors and businesses is highly uncertain. That adds to the speculative fervor already gripping Tesla’s stock price in a feedback loop. Indeed, the manager of the most popular active fund recently, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, has made big bets on both Tesla and a trust that owns bitcoin, fueling a record pace of inflows.<br />At a market value of about $800 billion, Tesla trades at about 6.5 times the combined value of  Ford  and  General Motors ,  despite controlling a small fraction of the global auto market. And Tesla lately has been losing market share in Western Europe to competitors including  Volkswagen ,  which has begun to compete aggressively in the electric category. The news of Tesla’s bitcoin investment eclipsed a negative headline for the company Monday about quality issues identified in the important Chinese market.</td>

      <td>An HBO documentary explores the oft-forgotten history of Black artists—from movements of the past half-century to today’s luminaries, including Kara Walker, Kehinde Wiley and Jordan Casteel—often in their own words.</td>
      <td><br /><br />‘All painting is about light; the obsession with light is at once visual, religious and erotic.” So says Kehinde Wiley in HBO’s new documentary “Black Art: In the Absence of Light” (Tuesday, 9 p.m.), an illuminating bird’s-eye view of the past half-century of Black art in America. Luminosity is central to Mr. Wiley’s work—best known is his radical presidential portrait of Barack Obama—and to the attitudes of so many of the personalities on camera here, shining as they do with the glow of creativity, the bright assurance in their hard-won talents, and the fiery admiration for those who came before them.<br />Those forebears are an unflagging presence throughout the film, directed by Sam Pollard, both onscreen and off. Painter Kerry James Marshall explains how Betye Saar’s “Black Girl’s Window” (1969) inspired his surprisingly diverse palette that deploys a range of blacks—turning the old adage on its head, he explains his view that “black is not the absence of color, black is particular kinds of color”—and we hear from Ms. Saar as she reminisces about teaching him. Theaster Gates, now best known as an installation and conceptual artist, started his career as a ceramist, and he talks passionately about discovering the work of Dave Drake at a point when he  knew only white potters. Drake, long dead, makes no appearance here, but his works do: stoneware vessels created by an enslaved man working in South Carolina, works simultaneously utilitarian and beautiful, and all the more captivating thanks to the inscriptions he added, etched into their surfaces at a time when literacy was uncommon—if not outright illegal—for men in his position.<br />So while the past can be a site of celebration, it is equally a locus of ignorance, exclusion and worse. The documentary takes as its inspiration and starting point the seminal 1976 exhibition “Two Centuries of Black American Art,” one of the events planned to commemorate the nation’s bicentennial. Organized by artist and curator David Driskell, that show—which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveled to Atlanta’s High Museum of Art, the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts and the Brooklyn Museum—was meant as a corrective to the widespread underrepresentation of Black artists in art historical contexts. Included were 1800s portraiture by Joshua Johnson, landscapes in the Hudson River School tradition by Robert S. Duncanson, and Tonalist works by Edward Bannister. “Two Centuries,” which also presented such modern practitioners as Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, Charles White and Alma Thomas, announced proudly that Black art was American art, even if major museums weren’t reflecting that fact.</td>

The company never got off the ground, and Messrs. Parnas and Correia used much of the funds to pay for personal expenses, prosecutors said.<br />Mr. Parnas has pleaded not guilty. His trial was set for early this year but has been postponed. A lawyer for Mr. Parnas didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />Messrs. Correia and Parnas were arrested on campaign-finance charges in October 2019, and the investigation expanded to include scrutiny of Mr. Giuliani’s business affairs and his efforts—often with Mr. Parnas at his side—to push for investigations in Ukraine that could benefit former President Donald Trump. Those efforts helped lead to Mr. Trump’s first impeachment; he was acquitted by the Senate.</td>

Among the costliest provisions was $142 billion in stimulus checks paid out in January and $25 billion in rental-assistance grants to state and local governments.<br />Spending on unemployment benefits, which received a top-up in the legislation, rose to $34 billion last month from $28 billion in December and $3 billion in January 2020, before the pandemic struck the U.S. economy.</td>

      <td>The saxophonist and pianist collaborate on an album featuring new duet versions of standards by John Coltrane, Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk.</td>
      <td><br />Saxophonist Archie Shepp and pianist Jason Moran are both jazz titans: Mr. Shepp, age 83, is an NEA Jazz Master and was an important protégé of John Coltrane; Mr. Moran, 46, is a MacArthur Fellow and artistic director for jazz at the Kennedy Center. The two men met backstage at a Belgian jazz festival in 2015 and, despite the nearly four-decade difference in their ages, a musical relationship began. They played together whenever the opportunity allowed, and a common interest emerged—recasting the blues within the classic jazz and gospel repertoires. “Let My People Go” (Archieball, out now), a collection of duets, is their first progress report.<br />The music was recorded at two concert halls—in Paris in 2017 and in Mannheim, Germany, the following year—but much of it has a gritty, unvarnished quality, as if played in an out-of-the-way roadhouse. And the intimate duet format feels very of the moment, the Covid-19 pandemic having put a hold on many midsize and large ensemble recordings and having led to an abundance of solo, duo and trio performances.<br />Before their collaboration, Messrs. Shepp and Moran were on convergent paths; each had moved beyond jazz to establish a voice in other genres and disciplines. Mr. Shepp remains best known as a firebrand whose work, both as a leader and with the New York Contemporary 5, was a cornerstone of the ’60s avant garde, but he also recorded three remarkable duet settings in the late ’70s and ’80s with pianist Horace Parlan that focused on similar repertoire to that heard in “Let My People Go.” Those albums helped rebrand Mr. Shepp as a savvy veteran. Age has not robbed the saxophonist of his ambition. Last year he released “Ocean Bridges” (Redefinition), a collaboration with his rapper nephew Raw Poetic and the multi-instrumentalist Damu the Fudgemunk that found common ground between jazz, hip-hop and new millennium funk.<br />Since winning his MacArthur in 2010, Mr. Moran has been exceptionally active both in jazz and in the visual art world. His artistic activities, which range from paintings and drawings to installations that focus on the spaces in which music is heard, have landed him a solo exhibit at the Whitney Museum in 2019 and shows at many other internationally known venues. All of his recent recordings have been in solos, duos or trios, and when not working as a leader he has collaborated with elders like bassist Dave Holland and saxophonist Charles Lloyd in small configurations. The pandemic seems to have done little to slow Mr. Moran down. In addition to “Let My People Go,” he recently released a solo disc, “The Sound Will Tell You” (Bandcamp). Made in conjunction with his show of the same name at New York’s Luhring Augustine gallery, which runs through Feb. 27, it was recorded in the first week of January and released on the 15th of that month. His larger, multidisciplinary production “Two Wings: The Music of Black America in Migration,” with his wife Alicia Hall Moran, toured major concert halls across the country in 2019 and is slated for performances this summer.</td>

But in April, her boyfriend broke up with her right as the pandemic set off social-distancing mandates that make dating much more complicated. The 34-year-old decided she would have to rethink her path to motherhood.<br />“Even if I met a guy quite quickly, I was three or four years away from having kids because I’d want some time where it was just the two of us,” says Ms. Wheeler, a digital-content producer in Los Angeles. “I began looking into ways I could take control of my fertility, without a man.” She booked a consultation at a fertility clinic and plans to freeze her eggs this spring.<br />Ms. Wheeler is one of many single women in their 30s and 40s who have found themselves reassessing their plans for having children in the past year. The pandemic has both made it harder to meet a partner and provided time for introspection. For some women, that has sparked a realization that they want to prioritize motherhood, regardless of whether they are in a relationship. Plenty of men, of course, have had similar epiphanies, but biology forces women to take action within a more limited window of time.<br />“For a single person who thought they wanted to have children within an established relationship, Covid has put a year-long hold on their ability to meet someone,” says Laura Lindberg, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization. “That may lead to some difficult decision making.”<br />In a June report from Guttmacher, more than 40 percent of women surveyed said the pandemic had changed their plans about when to have children and how many they wanted to have. The survey looked at women overall, not single women specifically. Thirty-four percent of women said they were putting motherhood on hold or planning to have fewer children because of the disruption caused by the virus.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats are poised to pass a significant—but temporary—expansion of the child tax credit as part of President Biden’s coronavirus relief package. Here’s a guide to the credit and the proposals to expand it.<br />It is a tax break for having and raising children.<br />Currently, parents can subtract up to $2,000 per child from their income taxes, following an expansion in the 2017 tax law. Parents of children under age 17 are eligible for the credit, which starts phasing out once income reaches $200,000 for individuals and $400,000 for married couples.<br />The credit isn’t a deduction, because it reduces the tax you owe dollar-for-dollar as opposed to reducing taxable income. So as a share of income, the credit becomes less valuable as income rises.<br />Some low-income families face limits on the credit, and that means 27 million children don’t get the full benefit, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The credit increases along with wages for low-income households, and only $1,400 is fully refundable, or payable even if someone doesn’t owe income taxes.</td>

      <td>DoorDash Inc.  said it is acquiring robotics startup Chowbotics, signaling increased interest in automating food production when ordering in is at an all-time high.<br />The companies didn’t disclose the terms of the deal, which The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Monday. Chowbotics was valued at $46 million in 2018, when it last raised money, according to data firm PitchBook.<br />Chowbotics’ technology can whip up salads and poke bowls, among other things, and DoorDash is exploring how to deploy it across restaurants, a person familiar with the matter said. Ideas include using the technology to help restaurants expand their menu—such as enabling a pizzeria to offer salads—or to allow a salad bar to try out new locations—a kiosk at an airport, for instance—without the need for more manpower.<br />“We’re working on solutions to help merchants grow in an ever-challenging and changing landscape, and with Chowbotics we hope to enhance that level of support,” DoorDash said in a blog post announcing the acquisition. The company said Chowbotics had installed its meal-making robots in hundreds of locations, including universities, hospitals, and grocery stores.<br />While automating food production could save restaurants time and cost, it’s unclear how amenable potential diners are to these technologies.</td>

      <td>Changing the rules of a game right before it’s played normally inspires skepticism, if not cynicism. But a new Time magazine report celebrates a well-funded effort to change voting processes and the flow of political information before the 2020 elections.<br />Time’s Molly Ball happily describes a “conspiracy” among the progressive left, big labor, big business and the Washington establishment to counter Donald Trump and suppress unwanted elements of U.S. political conversation before and after Election Day.<br />Like the various actors she describes at the heart of this vast campaign, Ms. Ball presents it as a virtuous effort to protect democracy from Mr. Trump and Covid-19. The participants in the conspiracy alleged by Ms. Ball certainly seem to have influenced the outcome. She writes:<br />She later adds that “the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream–a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it.”<br />Many voters are bound to disagree. And even those who don’t may still want a dispassionate review of the various changes to U.S. voting in 2020 and a consideration of their impact.</td>

The company amassed about 20 million users by the end of last year, and executives have told investors that Robinhood is planning an initial public offering in the first half of 2021, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.<br />But amid Robinhood’s growth, the company at times failed to give priority to things like customer service, communications and risk management.</td>

      <td>The Federal Reserve appears clueless about the dangers.</td>
      <td>Phil Gramm and Mike Solon make a convincing case for looming inflation in “The Risks of Too Much ‘Stimulus’” (op-ed, Feb. 3), yet the Federal Reserve appears clueless about the dangers. The Federal Open Market Committee projects that personal-consumption expenditure inflation won’t even reach 2% until 2023. Someone is very wrong here, and basic monetary theory suggests it is the Federal Reserve.<br />The Fed now totally ignores monetary trends. It still publishes the data, except for the M3 aggregate which was discontinued in 2006. As a result of this lack of analysis, it has failed to realize that much of the recent monetary increase is in household accounts, as stimulus checks have and are being saved and deposited. This is entirely different from the quantitative-easing jolts to the accounts of bond traders and financial institutions. All that is needed is a rapid increase in the velocity of money to cause rapid increases in aggregate demand.<br />The attainment of herd immunity to Covid-19 will guarantee a release in pent-up demand that will drive velocity higher. This will occur in an economy that is in reasonably good shape, contrary to the portrayal by hysterical media elements.<br />What happens when we get a new round of stimulus checks, along with rising costs due to a weak dollar in import markets, a surge in antibusiness regulations and perhaps an increase in the minimum wage? Add in the 28% increase in M2 last year with more to come, and the result is clear to anyone who remembers the inflation of the late 1960s and the ’70s, and to anyone who has studied the monetary analysis of Milton Friedman.<br />Em.

      <td>NEW DELHI—Hundreds of rescue workers and army personnel used construction equipment, shovels and their hands to dig through debris to try to find survivors of a flash flood that devastated a Himalayan valley in northern India on Sunday.<br />At least 26 people were confirmed killed and more than 170 remained missing Monday night, according to officials in the state of Uttarakhand, where the incident took place. Authorities said 27 people had been rescued from the debris. Those rescued and missing are mostly construction workers who were building two power plants along the Rishi Ganga and Dhauli Ganga rivers.<br />“There are around 35 people still trapped in one of the tunnels,’’ an Uttarakhand official said. “The rescue operation is in full swing and we hope to save more lives.”<br />The Indian government has sent a team of scientists to the affected area to investigate the cause of the incident. Some scientists believe the flood was triggered by what is known as a glacial lake outburst in India’s second-highest mountain peak, Nanda Devi, that sent a wall of water gushing downstream with severe force.<br />Local television broadcast videos of brown water and debris destroying dams and sweeping away buildings.</td>

Robert Byrd illustrates precisely why the filibuster should be done away with. Byrd infamously spoke for over 14 straight hours in a futile attempt to derail the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

      <td>Strategy, reflection and restraint made him one of the greatest diplomats of his era.</td>
      <td>George Shultz was perhaps the 20th century’s most consequential secretary of state, a group that includes George Marshall, Dean Acheson and Henry Kissinger. Between 1982 and 1989 Shultz and President Ronald Reagan forged a relationship with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that brought a peaceful end to the Cold War and relative freedom to some 400 million Soviet subjects—an impossible dream when Reagan took office in 1981.<br />Reagan had a sign on his desk: “There is no limit to what a man can do, or how far he can go, if he doesn’t mind who gets the credit.” Shultz was happy to credit Reagan for their joint achievements, which the secretary attributed to the president’s willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and change “the national and international agenda on issue after issue.” Shultz viewed his role as providing the diplomacy to realize that vision and to improve it. Sometimes that meant telling the president he was wrong, as with the Iran-Contra scandal or the president’s erroneous statement that there had been “fraud on both sides” in the 1986 Philippine election.<br />Shultz would be the first to say he was lucky to work with a great leader. Both men recognized they were lucky to have Mikhail Gorbachev as a counterpart. Shultz seized that luck to forge a trusting relationship between the two leaders and between himself and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.<br />“Trust is the coin of the realm,” Shultz believed, an adage he used as the title for an essay reflecting on his 100th birthday in December. With trust, good things happen. Without it, they don’t. Characteristically, when Shultz called out China on these pages last August for “wrecking Hong Kong,” he emphasized that China had “lost international trust,” making it “difficult to form future deals with China’s leadership.”<br />Even before Mr. Gorbachev’s ascent, Shultz began building trust with the Soviets on human rights, an issue on which there was no agreement on fundamentals. To resolve an impasse over a group of persecuted Pentecostal Christians sheltering in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and seeking asylum, Shultz made a deal to get them out of the Soviet Union in exchange for Reagan’s promise not to “crow” about it. “It was significant,” he said years later, “that Ronald Reagan’s first diplomatic achievement with the Soviets—largely unknown to the public—was on an issue of human rights.”</td>

But the long descent into hostilities is usually marked by events, large and small, that serve as grim historical milestones on the road to war.<br />Some of these are self-evidently consequential, large political acts that drive the wedge deeper between the parties. But some are symbolic yet capture more vividly the widening cleavage.<br />The British Parliament’s passage of the Townshend Acts in 1767 and 1768 imposed onerous levies on the American colonists and fueled the secessionist zeal. But it’s the Boston Tea Party most people think of when they seek an image of war made inevitable by intolerable acts. More than 80 years later, the Kansas-Nebraska Act hastened the path to civil war by abolishing the Missouri Compromise on the admission of new slave states. But John Brown’s Raid on Harpers Ferry still does more to fire the imagination, enshrined in popular memory as the moment the just cause of abolitionism made conflict necessary.<br />When historians look back at the disintegration of the U.S. in the 21st century, I wonder if they might identify the Great Pillow Fight as one of those symbolic moments that presaged a looming catastrophe.<br />Last week David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland, Fla., school shooting, announced a dream to launch a pillow-manufacturing company. In a series of tweets Mr. Hogg promised a product that would be union-made, support progressive causes and, above all, “not attempt a white supremacist overthrow of the United States government.”</td>

Hours later, Mr. Borrell learned during a meeting with Mr. Lavrov that Moscow was expelling three European diplomats. Mr. Borrell on Sunday wrote in his blog that “Russia is progressively disconnecting itself from Europe and looking at democratic values as an existential threat.” He said the bloc could impose sanctions over Mr. Navalny’s jailing.<br />Moscow over recent years has sought to divide the U.S. and the EU, its biggest trading partner, exploiting wariness in some EU capitals about economic sanctions imposed on Moscow after Russia’s 2014 intervention in Ukraine.<br />But last week’s developments have given an opportunity to the Biden administration. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that Washington wanted to coordinate closely with its European allies over Moscow’s handling of Mr. Navalny, who last week was sentenced to 3½ years in prison, effectively sidelining him from growing protest against the rule of President Vladimir Putin.</td>

Their bosses want to make sure they get the shots.<br />Meat-industry officials said vaccines now being provided to some essential workers offer the best chance of ensuring safety for employees who cut meat, standing shoulder to shoulder, for hours at a stretch each day. Vaccination rates among plant workers could determine whether the $213 billion U.S. meat sector can move beyond the crisis that has upended the industry this past year, sickening thousands of workers and killing more than 130, according to labor union estimates.<br />Many meatpacking-plant employees remain unsure of the vaccines’ safety and effectiveness, according to company surveys, worker groups and some workers themselves. Some worry about having to provide proof of immigration status to get a shot, worker advocates said, while others who don’t speak or read English might struggle to find out where to get one.<br />“There is no doubt that if we can get very high acceptance of the vaccine, it will be instrumental in helping us bring the pandemic under control,” said Tom Brower, senior vice president of health and safety for  Tyson Foods Inc.,  the largest U.S. meat processor by sales. The Arkansas-based company last week administered vaccines to 45 employees in a North Carolina chicken-processing plant, among the first shots offered to the hundreds of thousands of U.S. meatpacking workers.<br />So far, meat companies have said they won’t require workers to be vaccinated. Instead, companies including Tyson,  Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. ,  Sanderson Farms Inc.,  Smithfield Foods Inc. and Perdue Farms Inc. are producing educational videos, posters and presentations to promote the shots, joining employers in other industries in taking a bigger role to share public-health information with workers. Pilgrim’s and JBS USA Holdings Inc., the country’s biggest beef processor, will offer employees cash bonuses for getting vaccinated, and about 500 have taken the shots so far, a spokeswoman said.</td>

      <td>Large celebrations in Tampa after the Buccaneers’ win have raised concern over increased transmission of the virus</td>
      <td>TAMPA, Fla.—Car horns blared into the wee hours of the morning. Large crowds spilled into the streets. Fans gathered for a historic Super Bowl celebration—many without face coverings in the throes of this Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the first NFL team to ever win the Super Bowl on its home field when the team throttled the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 Sunday night. It was a cause for such widespread celebration that some, including Tampa mayor Jane Castor, are now expressing concern about potential coronavirus spread in the wake of a night of partying that was preceded by a week of growing crowds inside the city.<br />“I’m worried now that we might see another surge,” said Dr. Marissa Levine, a professor of public health practice at the University of South Florida and former state health commissioner in Virginia. “We never know until after the fact if an event has been a super spreader.”<br />This Super Bowl itself was a testament to pandemic-related safety measures in numerous ways. The NFL only reached this point as scheduled after pouring tens of millions of dollars into daily testing for its personnel, contact tracing for infected individuals and protocols that mandated social distancing and mask wearing inside team facilities. The game itself featured a reduced capacity crowd of 24,835, which included 7,500 vaccinated health-care workers.<br /></td>

At the same time, survey respondents predicted their future incomes would rise by 2.4%, a 0.2 percentage point increase from the prior month and the highest reading since February 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic took hold.<br />The New York Fed report arrives amid broad-based hope that the rollout of vaccines to combat Covid-19 will start allowing economies around the world to return to some semblance of normality, maybe even by this summer. A number of Fed officials believe that while data for the start of the year will showcase some challenges, the U.S. economy could grow by 5% to 6% this year.<br />The New York Fed data appears to show that consumers are themselves predicting a return to a healthy economy.<br />“Perceptions about households’ current financial situations compared to a year ago improved slightly in January, with fewer respondents reporting that credit is harder to obtain,” the report said. “Respondents were also slightly more optimistic about their households’ financial situations in the year ahead with more respondents expecting their financial situation to improve a year from now,” it said.</td>

Several progressives, including Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, have lined up to support Ms. Baradaran, while others back Mr. Barr. Mr. Brown chairs the Senate Banking Committee, which will have to green-light the eventual nominee.<br />Mr. Biden has emphasized building a diverse leadership team that “looks like America” and has made a number of barrier-breaking selections, including former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen as the first woman to lead the Treasury Department.</td>

Republicans on Capitol Hill, where the Senate is beginning on Tuesday its second impeachment trial of Mr. Trump in two years, continue to hone what the GOP represents with Mr. Trump out of office but broadly popular among the party rank and file.<br />They have found functional upsides. Republicans are for the first time in four years living without fear of presidential tweets inviting primary election challenges, or having to comment on his often controversial pronouncements. “Members definitely don’t miss it,” said one GOP Senate aide. Some Republican lawmakers and strategists are privately hoping that Mr. Trump’s exile from Twitter might make it easier for the party to move on from him to focus on the policy issues at hand—and on countering Mr. Biden.</td>

      <td>When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the country was in the throes of a financial crisis requiring immediate action. The result was a quick, $831 billion economic stimulus plan, pushed through Congress in less than a month.<br />The plan was passed almost entirely with Democratic votes; not a single House Republican supported it, and just three Senate Republicans did so. Politically, the problem with that outcome was that it set a partisan tone that lingered, making it hard for the Obama administration and Republicans to come together on subsequent initiatives. The residue of mutual bitterness and mistrust had lasting effects.<br />Fast forward to 2021, and the capital is in a similar situation. The Biden administration has taken office in crisis mode, facing a coronavirus pandemic that it believes requires immediate action—specifically, a new economic stimulus plan that can be in place before supplemental federal unemployment benefits expire on March 14. Once again, there is the prospect that action will be taken entirely, or almost entirely, with Democratic votes, because the gap between what the White House wants and what Republicans think is necessary is yawning.<br />Once again, the risk is that the outcome could set a partisan tone that colors the rest of the Biden term.<br />Administration officials say they hope that isn’t the case. Even if the stimulus plan is passed under special reconciliation rules in the Senate to avoid a Republican filibuster and allow it to be passed with only Democratic votes, officials hope it still will pick up some Republican votes, giving it at least a patina of bipartisanship.</td>

While some marques like Jeep and Ram have thrived, others have withered in recent years, dinged by a lack of new investment, aging models and sluggish sales, analysts and dealers say.<br />The question of how to revive Fiat Chrysler’s weaker brands has lingered for years, and it now falls to Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares to answer it. Mr. Taveres has said he doesn’t plan to cut any brands, and a Stellantis spokesman added that the company values its diverse lineup of brands, ranging from off-roaders at Jeep to family-haulers at Chrysler.<br />Chrysler, a nearly 100-year-old badge that once was the company’s namesake, now sells three models—two minivans and a large sedan—about half the number of nameplates it sold in showrooms a decade ago. Its U.S. sales have steadily slid: last year it sold roughly 110,500 vehicles, about one-third its volume in 2015, according to company figures.<br />Fiat, a maker of small cars reintroduced to the U.S. in 2011, has also struggled with a limited lineup, quality woes and a sharp drop-off in sales.</td>

A Federal Bureau of Investigation field office reported a rallying call for war and the sharing of maps of the Capitol. The Department of Homeland Security warned about the heightened potential for violence in the rally’s run-up, though mentioned no specific threat for Jan. 6.<br />While the information was shared, this multipoint warning system broke down, failing to generate sufficient follow-up, as officials spotted and dismissed these signals while missing others entirely, according to interviews with current and former officials and a review of internal government documents.<br />The result: The extensive local and federal law-enforcement network that protects Washington was never fully prepared, leaving the usually heavily guarded city center vulnerable to attack. That assault came Jan. 6 when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol as Congress was preparing to certify President Biden’s election victory.<br />“Nothing significant to report,” read a Jan. 5 national summary from DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis that was sent to law enforcement across the country, according to a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The office is responsible for monitoring threats online and sharing them with federal, state and local law enforcement.</td>

      <td>The tech stock frenzy has lifted many of SoftBank’s investments, but a market reversal would hit the company hard</td>
      <td>Japan’s  SoftBank ,  a big investor in technology companies, has certainly regained its confidence after a humbling 2019. Whether that confidence persists through the next market downturn is another question.<br />SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son is clearly upbeat. During Monday’s earnings briefing for the quarter ending in December, he compared SoftBank to a producer of golden eggs. It is surely producing a few lately. Food-delivery company  DoorDash netted $8.3 billion for SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund after an initial public offering in December was well-received. The 40% rise in Uber’s share price last quarter also pushed up the fund’s paper profits in the ride-hailing giant to $3.6 billion. And SoftBank is in the process of selling chip designer Arm to rival  Nvidia .  The Japanese company booked ¥1.77 trillion of investment gains last quarter, equivalent to $16.7 billion, mostly from the Vision Fund and its $10 billion successor.<br />Even WeWork, the office-sharing company that produced spectacular losses for SoftBank in 2019, may finally be turning a corner. The company is in talks to come to public markets to combine with a special-purpose acquisition company, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. Buoyant stocks mean SoftBank may keep listing some of its investments at high valuations, bringing additional windfalls.<br />SoftBank’s net asset value, however, fell by $37 billion last quarter: mostly because of the troubles of the company’s biggest investment, Alibaba. The Chinese e-commerce giant’s stock fell 21% in the quarter as the company was embroiled in antitrust investigations.<br />SoftBank’s share price nonetheless has continued to go up: it is now just 6% off its all-time high during the dot-com boom. SoftBank’s asset sales and buybacks last year helped narrow the discount of its market value to its net asset value.</td>

      <td>U.S. energy companies are getting into carbon capture in time to help their reputations and their bottom lines</td>
      <td>All the cool kids are doing carbon capture.<br />Exxon Mobil  is the latest to embrace the trend, announcing on Feb. 1 that it has formed a new business unit to commercialize its low-carbon technology portfolio, mostly comprising carbon capture and storage. The move comes on the heels of reports that a pair of activist investors are pushing the company for changes. One of those, Engine No. 1 LLC, reportedly is planning a proxy fight for board seats.<br />Exxon’s timing fits a pattern.  Occidental Petroleum  launched its low-carbon business—dubbed Oxy Low Carbon Ventures—in 2018, a year after shareholders pressured it to assess the long-term climate impacts of its business. As the industry faces questions—both from its own investors and from governments—about its role in the energy transition, many in the oil-and-gas sector have announced some form of investment in the technology, however small the dollar amount.<br />Both Exxon and Occidental’s moves followed shareholder pressure, but they are timely for other reasons, too: The stars are aligning just so on the policy front.<br />The oil-and-gas industry has in fact been using carbon capture well before global warming became a concern, mainly to produce even more hydrocarbons. Since the 1920s, the industry has used it to sift out unprofitable carbon dioxide that naturally occurs in natural-gas reservoirs from valuable methane. Starting in the 1970s, drillers began using it to squeeze more oil out of reservoirs.</td>

Factory owners fear political instability will push Western clients away, and that any Western efforts to pressure the generals by restoring broad sanctions or withdrawing trade preferences would be crushing.<br />“I am very afraid of going back to that time because I already know what the situation was like with sanctions,” says Aung Myo Hein, who opened a garment factory in Myanmar in 2013, when the European Union gave Myanmar’s garment exports duty-free access.<br />On Monday, protesters took to the streets to oppose the military’s seizure of power for a third straight day, with tens of thousands attending rallies and marches across the country. They included teachers, engineers, retail workers and others responding to calls by activists for a strike.<br />Only a third of the 1,200 people Mr. Aung employs reported for work on Monday, while others joined the demonstrations, he said.</td>

      <td>Some economists think a $1.9 trillion stimulus package could overheat the economy, but the bond market seems to disagree</td>
      <td>Some prominent U.S. economists believe that the Biden administration’s proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package is so large that it could overheat the economy. But the bond market seems to be in total disagreement, as are global financial markets generally.<br />Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and former International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard both recently suggested that the Biden administration risks overheating the economy. Mr. Blanchard suggested on Twitter that the program could lead to “not the 2.5% [inflation] that some predict, but potentially a lot more,” prompting “a very large increase in interest rates.”<br />Supporters of the argument might point to rising bond yields. At around 1.19%, the 10-year Treasury yield is at its highest level since early March. Inflation pricing in the bond market is back to levels last seen in 2014.<br />But those are levels that suggest a recovery, not an inflationary burnout. The U.S. yield curve still bears far more similarity to last summer’s depressed levels than its immediate post-2008 crisis steep slope.<br />If Mr. Summers and Mr. Blanchard are correct, then that entire lower-for-longer post-2008 paradigm would be at an end. Pushing long-end U.S. bond yields simply back to where they were at the end of 2010 would mean a tectonic shift—a once-in-a-generation money-making opportunity for bond bears, before even considering the effect on credit markets or equities.</td>

      <td>Nearly $1.7 trillion of securities trades are processed each day by Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.</td>
      <td>When Robinhood Markets Inc. and other brokers abruptly restricted trading in  GameStop Corp. , it cast a spotlight on a normally obscure corner of the financial markets: the clearinghouse that processes U.S. stock trades.<br />Robinhood’s move infuriated its customers, prompted dozens of lawsuits against the Menlo Park, Calif.-based startup and will be scrutinized in a hearing on Capitol Hill next week. Initially, many investors assumed the firm’s decision to limit buying GameStop shares was directed by hedge funds that had bet against the stock or by high-frequency trading firms. In fact, the move was prompted by something more mundane—a $3 billion margin call from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.<br />Robinhood and others are now calling for a modernization of the way DTCC processes nearly $1.7 trillion of securities trades each day to help prevent such an occurrence from repeating.<br />The DTCC is responsible for clearing and settling U.S. stock trades. In other words, after every trade, it ensures that the shares are delivered to the buyer and cash is delivered to the seller, a process that takes two business days.<br />To protect against the risk that a buyer or seller will default during those two days, a DTCC subsidiary known as the National Securities Clearing Corp. maintains a multibillion-dollar fund to be tapped in case of such a failure. The fund is maintained by deposits from brokerages including units of many Wall Street banks as well as  Charles Schwab Corp.  and Robinhood.</td>

At Enel’s rate, if it borrowed $100 for a year, it would pay back $99.39.<br />For the lender, in this case the money-market funds that buy commercial paper, the opposite is true. They get back less money.</td>

      <td>Chief of the social network whose users sparked GameStop stock-trading frenzy expresses confidence in its user-reliant model for policing speech</td>
      <td>Reddit Inc.’s role in the recent stock-trading frenzy has brought millions of new users to the social-media platform, its chief executive says, as well as scrutiny to the power of large communities online.<br />One of Reddit’s defining quirks is that it largely relies on users, instead of algorithms or armies of tech employees, to police speech. Those community moderators didn’t intervene when users in a forum called WallStreetBets egged on people to buy shares of heavily shorted stocks such as  GameStop Corp.  U.S. regulators are now probing whether the ensuing market upheaval resulted in securities-law violations.<br />In an interview, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the WallStreetBets episode has demonstrated the durability of the company’s model, as it matures and grows. The 37-year-old Reddit co-founder recently changed his Reddit profile image to WallStreetBets’ cartoonish mascot of a Wall Street trader with so-called diamond hands, in a show of support for the group.<br />“This whole event is showing the power of large communities of everyday people,” said Mr. Huffman. “Not just massive institutional and professional investors get to participate in the stock market.”<br />The action on Reddit has helped the company land new advertisers—its main source revenue—and bring back lapsed ones, including those who recently paused spending in the market melee, Mr. Huffman said. The most recent user numbers from Reddit, which isn’t profitable, put the daily average at 52 million as of October. “We’re still proving ourselves to advertisers,” he said. The company paid for a five-second commercial that aired Sunday for Super Bowl LV.</td>

      <td>From 2015 to 2017, as the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co. collected stakes in overseas hotels, financial institutions and office towers in a $40 billion deal-making frenzy, a question lingered: How did the company get so much money to spend?<br />Now, following the downfall of one of China’s most acquisitive companies, the findings of a provincial government working group are shedding some light on the unorthodox ways that money was moved around within HNA, which has a sprawling web of more than 2,000 subsidiaries, affiliates and shell companies.<br />Three publicly listed companies controlled by HNA, including its flagship carrier  Hainan Airlines ,  said in late January that billions of dollars were misappropriated from their businesses and that their coffers were drained by HNA’s activities. The three firms said their assets were also used to guarantee debts of HNA and its related entities.<br />An HNA spokeswoman declined to comment.<br />The recent disclosures are just the tip of the iceberg. HNA creditors, which include state-owned financial firms, have asked a court in Hainan to reorganize the company and disentangle the many complex financing arrangements that once powered its aggressive global expansion. HNA, which was sunk by massive debt, said it would submit to the legal process.</td>

      <td>Was the Reddit mania a win for “democratizing” investment? Or was it a demonstration that too much people power in financial markets stokes dangerous bubbles? As with all democracy, it will depend on the outcome for those less powerful.<br />On Friday,  GameStop  closed at around $64, 87% below its peak on Jan. 28. Other companies recently targeted by individual investors online, such as AMC and  BlackBerry ,  also deflated. The Treasury Department concluded on Thursday that “the core [market] infrastructure was resilient.”<br />The real political fallout, though, may be to come. Officials are investigating financial misconduct, particularly by brokerage firms that restricted purchases of some stocks last week. Politicians on both sides of the aisle lamented that professional speculators were protected at the expense of small traders. Brokers said they only took action because of risk limits imposed by clearing firms.<br />An explicit goal of Reddit gamblers was to torpedo hedge funds’ short bets, which they see as fraudulent manipulation by a Wall Street cabal. Yet trades by the Reddit gang also ended up benefiting many asset managers, including hedge funds.<br />But focusing on whether amateur or professional investors won or lost more in the GameStop saga risks missing the point. Most asset managers make their money through fees, not superior investment returns.</td>
