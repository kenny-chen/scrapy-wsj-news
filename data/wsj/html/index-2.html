      <td>Microsoft argues the cloud offers more protection; rivals point to the need of firms to hold, access their information on-premise</td>
      <td>The cyberattack that compromised many U.S. government and corporate networks is fueling a debate among big tech companies over what the safest way is for customers to store critical data.<br />It pits Microsoft Corp., which is urging clients to rely on cloud-computing systems, against others including Dell Technologies Inc. and  International Business Machines Corp. , who argue customers want to mix the cloud with the more traditional on-premise data-storage systems in a construct called hybrid-cloud.<br />Government and industry cybersecurity experts for about two months have been trying to unravel details of the incident that is causing a reassessment of long-held networking-security assumptions. The hackers, investigators believe, gained access via networking company SolarWinds Corp. and other avenues of attack.<br />In a House committee hearing about the hack Friday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said in prepared remarks, that “cloud migration is critical to improving security maturity across many organizations.” All of the attacks the company has identified involved on-premise systems, he has previously said.<br />The debate is part of the fallout from the suspected Russia-led hack that Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), on Tuesday said may be in scope and scale “beyond any that we’ve confronted as a nation.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden urged the Senate to take quick action after the House passed his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, as Democrats faced intraparty rifts over the future of a worker-pay increase.<br />The measure passed early Saturday largely along party lines, 219-212, with two Democrats joining all Republicans in opposition.<br />At the White House on Saturday, Mr. Biden said there was “no time to waste” in passing the bill and getting it to his desk, noting that Americans were now closer to receiving more vaccinations, $1,400 relief checks and additional aid contained in the bill.<br />“If we act quickly, decisively and boldly, we can finally get ahead of this virus, we can finally get our economy moving again,” Mr. Biden said. “The people of this country have suffered far too much for too long. We need to relieve that suffering.”<br />Lawmakers will likely alter the legislation before passing it in the Senate, which would send it back to the House to approve the amended bill before it reaches the president’s desk. Democrats are racing to finish the package before March 14, when certain types of federal unemployment assistance are set to expire.</td>

Two decades later she runs a San Francisco social media network used by one in four U.S. households.<br />It started in the late 1990s when Ms. Friar was a young consultant with McKinsey & Co. in London, and many of her colleagues wanted to attend Stanford University’s business school in California. She followed suit, thinking she would return home to the U.K. in two years. But dot-com mania struck, and after getting her M.B.A. she took a job analyzing technology stocks for  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.<br />“I am probably, frankly, better lucky than good,” said Ms. Friar.<br />After more than a decade at Goldman and stints as a finance executive at  Salesforce.com Inc.  and Square Inc., Ms. Friar in 2018 became boss of Nextdoor Inc.—a neighborhood-focused social network where locals come to swap recommendations for babysitters and handymen and post rooms for rent and items for sale.</td>

      <td>Soups can comfort on many levels. In these recipes, the deftly deployed spices bring heat, nuance, even antioxidants.</td>
      <td>I RECENTLY binge-watched a television series produced in France called “A French Village.” It centers on the fictional community of Villeneuve, near the French-Swiss border, and how the villagers coped during the German occupation in the early 1940s. Food was scarce, but what the characters were able to produce out of little was inspiring. More often than not, it was soup for breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br />I started to count how many times a character sat down to a bowl, took a hungry spoonful, looked up and said, “La soupe, elle est bonne.” I stopped counting somewhere in the fifth season—around the same the time I started cooking more steaming pots of my own. Soup is perhaps the most nourishing, most economical and most satisfying food. Cultures around the world make it. And for good reason. It is as basic as creating a flavor base, adding liquid and vegetables, grains or meat. Or all of the above.<br />I usually start with onions or shallots and garlic, perhaps bacon, pancetta or chorizo, an herb bundle, homemade chicken stock and then whatever’s in the fridge, on the windowsill or in the cupboard. A drizzle of good olive oil, a sprinkling of flaky Maldon sea salt, lots of freshly ground black pepper and a grating of Parmesan will be the finishing touches for a soup I make that skews Italian. A dollop of crème fraîche and a sprinkling of chives top the bowl if I’m leaning French; perhaps a splash of aged Sherry vinegar if I’m simmering something more Spanish.<br />This winter I’ve been gravitating toward turmeric, ginger and other spices said to boost the immune system. So I reached out to Ethan Frisch, co-founder of the fair-trade and sustainable spice company Burlap & Barrel, to get his thoughts on spicing soups. Prior to sourcing spices from Iceland to Guatemala to the Euphrates River, Mr. Frisch was a humanitarian aid worker for Doctors Without Borders on the Syrian-Jordanian border. There and in other remote areas where he volunteered, soups were a mainstay of his diet, and he came to depend upon both local and easily transportable spices to flavor them. Now at home in Queens, N.Y., he has a more sizable pantry, but his technique hasn’t changed. “I might start by tempering cumin in olive oil or butter, add some smoked paprika, cinnamon verum or cinnamon leaves, then some fresh aromatics, celery, carrots, smashed garlic, [and] let them nearly brown before adding broth. Or, if I want to open up my sinuses, I’ll bloom Cobanero chilies, which I love for their fruity smokiness, with some smoked paprika, cinnamon, star anise and black pepper.”<br />Recently, Mr. Frisch launched a Burlap & Barrel series of three masalas created by the late chef and restaurateur Floyd Cardoz. I think of these spice mixes as soup jump starters. They make rather complex and nuanced flavors remarkably easy to pull off. For example, the Goan Masala needs only coconut milk and broth to form a soup both piquant and creamy. The Kashmiri Masala lends a sweet heat, with brightening notes of fennel, ginger and cardamom, as it does in a recipe for Goan pork soup I like to make, adapted from Mr. Cardoz and his wife, Barkha Cardoz. Simply add a bit of stock to moong dal, a classic Indian dish of split mung beans, and you have a rich and protein-packed soup. For a soup with a similarly velvety texture but a more Middle Eastern inflection, infuse lentils with cumin, coriander, mustard seeds and fennel seeds. A topping of crumbled feta and fresh cilantro makes this soup nearly as hearty as a stew.</td>

      <td>As dozens of new battery-powered, plug-in car models come to market, roadtrippers who bought anything but a Tesla are discovering that America’s charging infrastructure isn’t ready for prime time</td>
      <td>Bradley Wilkinson is the owner of a 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, and the kind of electric-vehicle diehard who knows how to squeeze every last mile of range out of his vehicle.<br />Even so, during his most recent road trip, from Tampa, Fla., back home to Fort Carson, Colo., he spent about 58 hours on the road. In a gasoline-powered vehicle, on average, the 1,900-mile journey would take about 30. His relatively sluggish pace was due to his need to regularly power up the Bolt’s battery at a “fast” charger—so called because they’re many times faster than typical home chargers.<br />Less experienced EV owners report far bigger inconveniences than Mr. Wilkinson’s. Those include: too few charging stations, too much demand at the stations that are available, broken chargers, confusing payment systems, exorbitant electricity rates, and uncertainty over how long their cars need to charge.<br />While EVs can be powered up at home, industry analysts and academics believe that a fast-charging infrastructure is essential to getting beyond their current limited adoption. This next wave of slightly-less-early adopters is critical to a global automotive industry betting heavily on battery power.<br />Yet so far, only one carmaker has offered a reassuring pitch about conveniently and reliably recharging on the go: Tesla. And Tesla’s fast-charging technology doesn’t work on non-Tesla cars.</td>

      <td>Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  posted an increased fourth-quarter profit Saturday, with the billionaire investor using his annual missive to investors to explain a recent surge in stock buybacks.<br />For the year, Berkshire bought back nearly $25 billion in shares, according to the company’s earnings report. Before the last few years, Mr. Buffett had refused to buy back any Berkshire stock.<br />In Mr. Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders, he defended the larger-than-usual buybacks, saying they enhance the intrinsic value for shareholders but still leave Berkshire ample funds for any opportunities. He was less than complimentary of other chief executives buying back stock.<br />“American CEOs have an embarrassing record of devoting more company funds to repurchases when prices have risen than when they have tanked,” he wrote.<br />Berkshire’s available cash and short-term Treasury bonds were $138.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Investors have been watching for over a year to see if Mr. Buffett would buy a significant stake in a large company as he has in other turbulent times for the U.S. economy.</td>

      <td>After the pandemic killed music tours and their opportunities to sell concert T-shirts and other products, the industry pivoted to streaming. For some artists, that’s only expanded the merch market.</td>
      <td>IN THE SUMMER of 2018, Grace Hall-Ramsay attended a live Harry Styles concert in San Jose, Calif., and had a life-changing experience. The British pop star spotted the 18-year-old in the audience holding a sign that read “I’m Gonna Come Out to My Parents Because of You!” He asked for her mother’s name and—told it was Tina—proceeded to goad a crowd of thousands to yell in unison, “Tina, she’s gay.” The moment understandably went viral. Ms. Hall-Ramsey, an ardent Styler—as the singer’s fans call themselves—had planned to attend 20 Harry Styles concerts in 2020.<br />That didn’t happen. The pandemic brought live music to a halt, but it didn’t wilt Ms. Hall-Ramsey’s fandom. One way she’s maintained a connection to her idol: his increasingly dynamic merch shop. Over the past year, Mr. Styles and his team stoked the momentum following his second album, “Fine Line,” through buzzy music videos and an online shop that released limited-edition capsule collections with the debut of each new video, far exceeding the industry norm (typically, a single merch set is released per major album tour). In quarantine Mr. Styles promoted his album with frequent drops of T-shirts, hoodies, beach towels, prayer candles and other merchandise that alluded to the videos’ themes. “It’s literal [fashion] collections,” said Ms. Hall-Ramsey. “Like, ‘I have to get that, it’s fall/winter.’”<br />Mr. Styles isn’t the only artist redefining the merch formula. Over the past year, many musicians realized that, even if they weren’t touring, their fans would eagerly snap up clothing and other products to commemorate digital moments. These merch opportunities range from music-video drops to intimate live-streamed concerts, album anniversaries to Instagram Live appearances.<br />Dance diva Dua Lipa offered exclusive merch tied to “Studio 2054,” a live-streamed concert that drew over five million viewers in November. The webcast series Verzuz started producing merch to commemorate its once-in-a-lifetime “battles” between R&B and hip-hop notables. Some acts, like rock band the Killers and R&B singer Teyana Taylor have released merch that features tracklists in lieu of the traditional lists of tour dates. Singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright has taken a more DIY approach, upcycling deadstock shirts from past tours to create hybrid T-shirts as souvenirs for live-streamed concerts.<br />In 2019, the last year on record, the global music merch business brought in $3.663 billion in sales revenue, according to Licensing International’s Annual Global Licensing Survey. As tours have vanished, that’s become an internet-first operation. “When all of those things got put on hold or cancelled, [merch] was the only person sitting at the table,” said Edward Aten, the founder of e-commerce platform Merchbar, which works with over 35,000 artists. The realization, he added, “was, like, ‘hey we can do lots of stuff.’”</td>

While award ceremonies have taken on a different look during the pandemic, leaving more room for the unpredictable, there are still some things we can be certain of for the big night this Sunday.<br />The Golden Globes will be airing tomorrow, Sunday, Feb. 28, and begin at 8 p.m. ET. The awards ceremony usually lasts about three hours.<br />The event will be broadcast on NBC and available through the network’s website with a television-provider login. The event will also be available to stream on the Roku Channel, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV, Sling TV and Fubo TV. If you don’t have access to these platforms, many are offering free trials. If you miss the ceremony on Sunday, the event will also be available to watch Monday on NBC’s Peacock service.<br />With more people spending more time at home and movie theaters closed over the last year, there has been no shortage of breakthrough television and films to stream. As a result,  Netflix  is looking at an impressive 42 nominations this year, including Aaron Sorkin’s courtroom drama “The Trial of the Chicago 7.” Another favorite from streaming giant Hulu up for four nominations is Chloé Zhao‘s “Nomadland.” Among the five nominees for best director, three are women including Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) and Regina King (“One Night in Miami”), along with director Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”).<br />Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will be hosting the Golden Globes for the fourth time. However, they will be on different coasts, with Ms. Fey presenting from the Rainbow Room in New York and Ms. Poehler from Beverly Hills, Calif. Guests, nominees and award winners will also be broadcasting live from their respective locations. The comedic duo follows Ricky Gervais, who hosted his fifth Golden Globe awards last year.</td>

Baime.<br />My wife, Debbie, and I have been married for 44 years, and we have been collecting vintage cars and memorabilia all that time. We have probably owned over 200 vintage cars. We collect anything having to do with automobiles: vintage signs, gas pumps, gas station soda machines. One of the things that drew me to the Edsel was this: When you show up at a car show with a Corvette or a Mustang, there are always dozens of others there. When you show up at a car show with 400 cars and you are in an Edsel, yours is probably the only one there.<br />The story of the Edsel is one of the most interesting stories in all of car history.  Ford Motor Co.  built the Edsel to bridge the gap between the base Ford and the luxury Lincoln and Mercury, just like  General Motors  had the Buick and Oldsmobile between Chevrolet and Cadillac. The Edsel was its own brand, and when it rolled out on Sept. 4, 1957, 18 different models were available—the Edsel Ranger, the Pacer, the Corsair, the Citation, etc. [Ford declared the launch date “E-Day,” and marketed the car with an hour-long TV special starring Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong and Bob Hope.]<br /><br /></td>

      <td>TORONTO—The U.S. and Canada plan to modernize a network of defense satellites and radar in the Arctic, in a bid to counter a growing military presence in the north from Russia and China.<br />President Biden asked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ramp up Canada’s spending on defense, including an upgrade of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, commonly known as Norad, during a bilateral meeting between the two leaders on Tuesday, according to an official familiar with the discussions.<br />Norad was a central part of the U.S. and Canadian military’s Cold War deterrence strategy against the former Soviet Union. Consisting of satellites, ground-based radar, and air-force bases located mostly in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic, the surveillance system was designed to give the military allies notice of any impending attack from the north.<br />The system, once state-of-the-art, has since become outdated. New missiles being deployed by Russia and China can travel at more than five times the speed of sound and fly much farther than their predecessors, which would overwhelm the existing surveillance network, said Michael Dawson, who served as Canadian political adviser to Norad command in Colorado from 2010 to 2014.<br />In addition, a melting polar ice cap is leaving the once impassable Arctic Ocean ice-free for longer periods of time, creating new vulnerabilities for the U.S. and Canada, current and former military officials say.</td>

If you’re like me, that unsightly metal rectangle is probably overstuffed with old utility bills, medical records and tax returns. With tax season under way and extra time at home, it isn’t a bad time to do some spring cleaning.<br />So what should you keep in the filing cabinet, what should you scan and save in the cloud, and what should you just toss in the shredder? I consulted experts in several fields to find out.<br />Tax documents. Individuals only need to keep tax returns and related documents for three years from the date the original return was filed, according to the Internal Revenue Service. There are some exceptions and different periods of limitations for filing refund claims listed here.<br />There are some records you should hold on to even longer, said Andy Phillips, a director at H&R Block’s Tax Institute. For example, if you’ve made improvements to a home you own and rent out, it’s wise to keep records of all repairs and new appliances so you can determine your cost basis when you sell the property.<br />However, you don’t have to keep paper versions of these. Mr. Phillips said it’s fine to produce digital records in the event of an IRS audit.</td>

Hundreds of schools across a vast swath of Africa’s most populous country have been closed in recent days, while surveillance aircraft and security forces have been dispatched to hunt for the missing.<br />The 42 hostages freed on Saturday were taken from a school in the Kagara district of Niger state, which borders the capital Abuja, and marched into the sprawling Rugu forest on Feb. 17, when gunmen overwhelmed the school security, killing one student.<br />“The Abducted Students, Staff and Relatives of Government Science College Kagara have regained their freedom and have been received by the Niger State Government,” Abubakar Sani Bello, the governor of Niger state, said on  Twitter .

They are stylized maple leaves, inspired by the local landscape over different seasons—but they were not meant to be the centerpiece of “The Kimono in Print: 300 years of Japanese Design,” which explores the ways fashion and printmaking have intersected in Japan. The kimono, commissioned by and for the Worcester Art Museum, was supposed to have appeared in a concurrent show organized in conjunction with Chiso, a kimono-making workshop in Kyoto in operation since 1555.<br />Covid-19 disrupted that plan, and the museum’s curatorial team deftly adapted. They transformed “Kimono Couture: The Beauty of Chiso” into an online presentation about the history and making of kimonos, each installment pegged to a piece that would have been on display. The final section centers on this garment, the only one to travel here from Japan. In its new venue, surrounded by a selection of some 60 woodblock prints and illustrated books, most from the museum’s permanent collection, the kimono underscores the extent to which these garments act like canvases. Nobody has ever crimped, pleated or ruched their fabric; nobody has ever significantly altered their basic T-cut. All decoration and artistry takes place on their surfaces. In this case, Imai Atsushiro, Chiso’s senior designer, devised the composition, and a team of specialized artisans transferred it onto jacquard silk using five dyeing techniques, embroidery and gold leaf.<br />Immediately striking in the printed depictions of kimonos is the endless variety and interplay of motifs—flowers, fruits, leaves and grasses; clouds, waves, butterflies and phoenixes; checks, stripes, bold zigzags, tiny “fawn dots,” and on and on. Occasionally, a full-fledged artwork fills the back of a kimono, the name the garment acquired in the mid-1800s and that translates simply as “thing to wear.” Kikugawa Eizan’s print from around 1830 depicts the courtesan Yoyoyama swiveling to show off the white-on-black brush painting of bamboo that fills the back of her garment, complete with the artist’s signature seals.</td>

      <td>The jazz guitarist experiments with classical composition on an album with the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet and Jason Vieaux.</td>
      <td><br />You would think that the worlds of classical and jazz guitar would be closely aligned, given that both prize harmonic ingenuity, melodic exploration (and variation) and a high level of virtuosity. There are technical distinctions: Although some jazz players use the nylon-stringed classical instrument, steel strings and amplification are more typical now, and different approaches to tone and articulation underpin each style. Those are hardly unsurmountable barriers to cross-genre exploration, but except for Brazilian mostly jazz composers like Egberto Gismonti and Hermeto Pascoal, and a few young Americans, like Gyan Riley, who work both sides of the street, the interchange has been sparse.<br />Pat Metheny has taken a bold step to remedy that with “Road to the Sun” (BMG), due out on March 5, with two substantial scores—the six-movement title work, performed here by the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet, and a four-movement solo work, “Four Paths of Light,” played by Jason Vieaux—plus Mr. Metheny’s own arrangement and performance of Arvo Pärt’s “Für Alina.”<br />One of jazz’s most restlessly diverse guitarist-composers, Mr. Metheny has flirted with classical style on occasion, going back to “Unquity Road” (1976) and “Hermitage” (1979), and he made the first recording of Steve Reich’s “Electric Counterpoint” (1987). These two new scores suggest that he has internalized the formal repertory. Both are rich in allusions to the techniques that propel virtuosic works by Francisco Tárrega, Federico Moreno Torroba, Heitor Villa-Lobos and other contributors to the standard canon, but those moves are filtered through Mr. Metheny’s more up-to-date sensibilities, not to mention his own command of the fretboard.<br />Probably the clearest case in point is the finale of “Four Paths of Light.” Though it does not quote Tárrega’s “Recuerdos de la Alhambra” directly, it borrows that work’s main structural device—setting a graceful tremolando melody, on the guitar’s top strings, over an arpeggiated bass figure that outlines the supporting harmonic changes. Though the melody and harmony are Mr. Metheny’s own, it is impossible to hear the new piece without Tárrega’s coming to mind.</td>

      <td>We received tremendous feedback from participants in The Wall Street Journal Fitness Challenge, a six-week program developed by Arnie Kander, an NBA sports performance coach. Haven’t signed up yet? You can start at any time here.<br />Mr. Kander uses a 20-second step-up test to provide a baseline for participants to improve upon. For an idea of what it should look like, check out this video. A number of participants wrote asking about proper form and adjustments. Mr. Kander and our expert panel weigh in:<br />The final exercises in the core series are a push-up followed by a plank hold. There are many ways to do a push-up and plank. Can you explain proper technique?<br />The push-up in the program is the standard facing-down movement with good posture of head level to shoulders and pelvis, Mr. Kander says. “Keep this line of posture as you descend into the movement,” he says. “Hands are slightly wider than shoulder width. Let the elbows naturally drift away slightly from the body to activate more of the larger pectoral muscle. Go as low into the movement as comfortable. If it’s been a while since you’ve done a push-up or have shoulder limitations, do not go as low.”<br />After, follow with a high plank, which is the initial starting position of the push-up, he says. Focus on maintaining a straight line from head to shoulders and pelvis and keep your core engaged. “Remember to not hold your breath during these movements,” he says. “You can do the high plank right after the push-ups for more core endurance if your level of fitness is higher, or take a 30-second rest in between,” he says.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court exempted five California churches from a county health directive intended to stem the coronavirus pandemic by prohibiting indoor gatherings.<br />The court’s unsigned order, issued late Friday over the dissent of three liberal justices, blocked Santa Clara County from enforcing the regulation against the churches while litigation continues. It was the latest in a string of orders from the court’s conservative majority directing state and local authorities to curb public-health efforts that restrict indoor religious gatherings.<br />“This outcome is clearly dictated by this Court’s decision in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom,” the court said, referring to its decision earlier this month exempting religious services from California’s statewide regulations that prohibited most indoor gatherings for activities such as political rallies, lectures and performances. The court directed the state to classify religious services along with shopping malls, salons and bus terminals, which were limited to 25% capacity.<br />Santa Clara County, whose measures against the pandemic are among the strictest in California, continued to prohibit indoor gatherings, which it said included “political events, weddings, funerals, worship services, movie showings, cardroom operations.” Other indoor activities, including shopping, were permitted at 20% capacity.<br />The Gateway City Church, in San Jose, and four other churches contested the county’s order as conflicting with the Supreme Court’s directives, but a federal appeals court in San Francisco declined to block the restriction.</td>

She said that despite the CDC’s September order, Oaktree affiliates and their property managers had initiated at least 270 eviction proceedings since then, including more than 100 this year.<br />Oaktree operates over 15,000 residential units across the U.S. through joint ventures and professional managers that operate those properties, collect rent and manage evictions, a person familiar with the matter said, noting that sending an eviction notice doesn’t mean the process is concluded. But the person said some renters in the firm’s properties were evicted during the pandemic.<br />Ms. O’Grady said the Stakeholder Project raised the eviction issue several times with Oaktree in December.

      <td>Friday morning’s airstrike against Iran-backed militias in eastern Syria sends a clear message: President Biden will use force to defend American lives. But this welcome development is an exception to the rest of Mr. Biden’s emerging Iran policy.<br />The President authorized the mission Thursday as a response to deadly rocket attacks against American and allied personnel in Iraq this month. The strikes, meant to target the Iranian proxies Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, destroyed several weapons storage facilities.<br />The Pentagon didn’t confirm casualty numbers, but media reports suggest well over a dozen pro-Iranian fighters were killed as the U.S. also struck trucks loaded with weapons. The message will be heard in Tehran and by other U.S. adversaries.<br />On the other hand, there’s Mr. Biden’s seemingly eager desire to return to the flawed 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. After announcing that Washington couldn’t “snap back” United Nations sanctions, the new Administration is consulting with South Korea about releasing at least $1 billion in frozen Iranian assets. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week the U.S. wants to “lengthen and strengthen” the accord—good—but then said President Trump’s sanctions on Iran had failed.<br />How giving up sanctions will get Iran to agree to a better deal is left unsaid. And, no surprise, Tehran has responded to the overtures by curbing access for International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and threatening to further enrich uranium.</td>

      <td>The Biden Administration’s release Friday of a classified report on the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is morally satisfying. Whether it furthers U.S. interests or even human rights in the long run is another question.<br />The report, delivered to Congress in declassified form, puts the onus squarely on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for ordering Khashoggi’s kidnapping and killing. The report doesn’t offer direct evidence of the order; it bases the judgment on the Crown Prince’s control of decision-making in the Kingdom and the involvement of a key adviser and members of his personal security detail.<br />News of the classified report was leaked at the time, in part to embarrass Donald Trump. The former President viewed the Crown Prince known as MBS as an ally and didn’t want to jeopardize Saudi-U.S. ties. He accepted MBS’s denial without nuance or moral condemnation, which was his habit. President Biden is downgrading those ties, or what he calls a “recalibration,” which will play well on Capitol Hill with progressives and isolationists who want to distance the U.S. from the Saudis.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken also announced Friday what he called a “Khashoggi Ban,” a new visa-restriction policy on individuals who “are believed to have been directly engaged in serious, extraterritorial counter-dissident activities.” The U.S. will apply the new ban to 76 Saudis, and it might do some good as a warning to foreign officials that they and their families could be barred from the U.S. if they act against opponents abroad. Don’t underestimate how many foreign leaders want to send their children to Stanford or Duke.<br />But note that the U.S. didn’t apply that sanction to MBS, who is the Saudi defense minister and probably the next King. Democrats and the media are already calling this inadequate and want MBS barred if not indicted. The Biden Administration seems to appreciate that this would lead to a more serious break in U.S.-Saudi relations that would help adversaries in Tehran, Moscow and Beijing.</td>

      <td>New evidence that green policies punish the poor and subsidize the rich.</td>
      <td>The contradictions of green energy policies are becoming more obvious in the real world, and now comes more evidence in a new study of California’s electricity rates. The policies even contradict green climate goals.<br />“California has charted an ambitious course towards decarbonizing its economy,” the study by nonprofit Next 10 and the University of California, Berkeley Energy Institute at Haas declares. “At the same time, California has among the highest electricity prices in the continental U.S. These two facts create a tension: decarbonizing the economy most likely requires electrification of transportation and space and water heating, but high prices push against such a transition. High prices also have troubling implications for equity and affordability.”<br />No kidding. California’s myriad green-energy subsidies and mandates are baked into electric rates, which are now about 80% higher in northern California than the national average and twice as high in San Diego.<br />The state requires renewables like wind and solar to make up 60% of electricity generation by 2030. The study says renewable prices (albeit with subsidies) are now roughly the same as other power sources, but utilities signed long-term contracts with solar and wind producers years ago when prices were higher. Utilities also need backup power when it’s cloudy, which adds costs. Yet the state sometimes has to pay Arizona to take its excess solar power to avoid overloading the grid.<br />And here’s the kicker: Folks with solar panels get paid for surplus power they don’t use—sometimes at two to three times the rate of wholesale power. So California pays the well-to-do to generate solar power it doesn’t need and then pays Arizona to take it.</td>

      <td>At the very least, outright nastiness seems to be a strike against a politician.</td>
      <td>‘Nice guys finish last,” said Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher, whom no one ever called a nice guy. Apparently Durocher was talking about New York Giants manager Mel Ott, whose niceness “Leo the Lip” considered responsible for the Giants’ abysmal 1946 record. But does being nice—decent, generous, kind—really reduce one’s chance for success? Does it do so in politics?<br />One doesn’t often think of the connection between politics and niceness. Disraeli, Gladstone, Churchill, Lincoln, both Roosevelts, Truman—one can find many things to say about each, but niceness isn’t the first word that comes to mind. Some might even view niceness as a detraction in politics. Adlai Stevenson could never drop his modesty while pursuing presidential power.<br />Would anyone cast a vote for political office, from president down to dogcatcher, because a candidate was nice? Perhaps not. Yet in last year’s presidential election, many Americans voted against Donald Trump less because of his policies than because they thought him a braggart, a bully, a buffoon—all things a nice guy isn’t. Had Mr. Trump been less bumptious, had he attempted to establish himself as a more sympathetic figure, would he be beginning his second term as president? Hard to know, but exhibiting a touch or two of niceness surely wouldn’t have hurt his chances.<br />How many of our recent presidents or presidential candidates qualified as nice? Ronald Reagan was less nice than charming, which isn’t the same; charm is about outer attractiveness, niceness about inner thoughtfulness. George H.W. Bush, who tried to sell himself as a Texan, never lost the East Coast WASP in himself that came off as more dignified than nice. Bill Clinton’s claims to niceness were squashed by reports of his sexual predations. Barack Obama came off as nice; he seemed a good father and devoted husband. But he could also be acerbic when challenged. Hillary Clinton might have lost the presidency by too clearly establishing her lack of niceness. How many votes, one wonders, did she lose by calling Mr. Trump’s supporters “deplorables”?<br />The one American president with whom I have had a personal encounter—for a half an hour—is George W. Bush. It took place in the Oval Office in 2003, when I, along with 10 others, received the National Humanities Medal. I didn’t care for the war in Iraq, but as I watched Mr. Bush hand out medals and take photographs with recipients, being especially and genuinely solicitous of the grandchildren a few of them brought along for the occasion, I thought to myself: “This is a nice man.” When Partisan Review editor Edith Kurzweil received her medal, she said to him, “I never believed I’d be in this room.” To which Mr. Bush replied, “Neither did I believe I would.” A nice guy.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump is not the only one who abandoned a prudent reluctance to be caught fibbing.</td>
      <td>Any claim you can imagine can be put into words. That’s why we in journalism don’t put faith in claims. The first and only evidence for a claim sometimes is who’s making it. Citing “two law enforcement officials,” the  New York Times  reported in January that Capitol Hill policeman Brian Sicknick was killed by a fire extinguisher blow to the head. A statement by his family, though, carefully avoided the issue of cause. A ProPublica report offered details that seemed inconsistent with the Times account. A local  CBS  station reported that Mr. Sicknick died of a stroke, citing a named police union official.<br />For all these reasons, I carried an asterisk in my head about the story from day one. Now the New York Times has issued an “update” saying the manner of his death remains unresolved.<br />False versions of events propagated by news reports have probably turned into accepted history more often than we think, but something seems different today. From Donald Trump’s postelection lies to the Democratic Russia collusion hoax, plainly untrue things have assumed a weirdly dominant role in our national life.<br />I partly blame Mr. Trump’s arrival on the political stage but not precisely for the reason you might think. His nonconformity, his brand of unauthorized and idiosyncratic lying, triggered a response from our national elites that amounted to “hooray, now we can lie more recklessly too.”<br />Adam Schiff jumped off a cliff with the collusion hoax. Many reporters jumped with him. There was no blowback. Racial incidents proliferated that seemed to have been invented out of whole cloth. Mr. Trump himself miscalculated that his election lies would be the ultimate proof that there’s no such thing as bad publicity for his brand.</td>

      <td>Immigrants to America quickly learn that you don’t bargain when shopping. If a fishmonger prices something at $7.50 a pound, you don’t offer to buy it for $4.50, telling him that a fish that’s been dead longer than your grandfather (God rest his soul) can’t be worth what he asks. A fixed price, says Roya Hakakian, can be depressing to immigrants for whom haggling was once “the most satisfying aspect of any shopping experience.” And yet, with its immense and disarming cultural genius, America offers the recent arrival something in lieu of the pleasure (now lost) of being able to beat a vendor down: the right to return a purchased product.<br />In “A Beginner’s Guide to America”—a book written “for the immigrant and the curious”—Ms. Hakakian tells us that many newcomers to America react with disbelief when they learn that stores will take goods back, even days after a sale was made. Being entitled to a refund, she says, is “the surest sign of America’s greatness to them,” proof that “anything is possible because a one-time decision need not be destiny.”<br />This observation takes the seemingly banal into the realm of the profound and is characteristic of Ms. Hakakian’s honest and beautiful book. She describes her text as “part memoir, part reportage, and part a work of imagination,” presenting America to the reader “through the weathered perspective of a naturalized citizen.” Ms. Hakakian arrived in the U.S. in 1985 as a Jewish refugee from Iran, with no English. (She tape-recorded her professors in her first year at Brooklyn College.) More than three decades later, she is a widely published essayist and poet, a Guggenheim fellow, and an assimilated immigrant who wishes above all else to help others assimilate.<br />In the hands of someone less subtle and humane, Ms. Hakakian’s exercise could be seen as presumptuous. Hers is a “guide,” yes, but of an amicable kind. She offers counsel to readers, not commandments, and although her book could be seen as a love letter to America, it is one that’s been written by an exacting lover who isn’t blind to this country’s flaws. Even as she notes how much more accepting of immigrants America is than anywhere else in the world, she attributes some of this tolerance to reforms “forced” upon the nation by “slaves and their descendants.” Elsewhere she calls attention to America’s chronic problem of school shootings. “They may not have had proper books, or benches,” she says of the conditions faced by immigrant children in their countries of origin, “but their teachers did not have to train themselves” to face down a shooter in school corridors and classrooms.<br />But school in America is precisely where the new immigrant also confirms how backward his old country was: There are no textbooks prescribed by the Ministry of Education, and libraries exist to turn children into readers of books. Ms. Hakakian contrasts the open spirit of inquiry in American education with the practice of rote learning in places like Iran. “When you left your country on a student visa to study in America,” she writes—addressing a hypothetical student from abroad—“even you did not realize that you were an educational refugee, a person who had never experienced the thrills of open discussion.” (It will be years, she writes, before immigrants, too, learn of “the shortcomings of this education system.” That insight is proof, however dispiriting, of their assimilation.)</td>

      <td>More digitized and connected than ever, the nation’s infrastructure is vulnerable to cyberattack.</td>
      <td>I first saw the inside of a water-treatment plant in 2015. I was conducting a site visit at a municipal facility in New Jersey, where I was the state’s director of cybersecurity. It wasn’t an inspection; the plant manager had asked me to visit.<br />Changes at the facility over the years had made him uneasy. Analog machinery had given way to digital systems, and critical water-treatment processes were now automated. The plant required little human intervention in day-to-day operations. Thanks to remote-access technologies, more maintenance and monitoring activities were being performed off-site by a third party. All this was great for efficiency, especially for his resource-limited operation, but what about the risk? Optimizing for cost and speed meant connecting more digital and networked technologies to his plant floor. Security was no longer simply a matter of gates, guards and guns. It had become a matter of bits and bytes.<br />In early February that plant manager’s unease became another’s reality when someone reportedly tried to poison the water supply in the Gulf Coast city of Oldsmar, Fla. According to the Pinellas County Sheriff, a hacker gained remote access to Oldsmar’s water-treatment-plant network and briefly increased the amount of sodium hydroxide in the water by 100 times—enough to cause death or serious injury to anyone who drank or touched it. Thankfully a technician noticed the anomaly and booted the hacker off the network before any damage was done.<br />What happened in Oldsmar fell just short of the nightmare scenario. The average person is unaware how dependent the country’s critical infrastructure has become on digital technology. At power plants, waterworks and all manner of public utilities, special-purpose computers known as human-machine interfaces connect to ruggedized-process controllers that regulate actuators to spin turbines, rotate robotic arms or, in this case, open valves to release sodium hydroxide.<br />In a perfect world these communications and the operations they command would be walled off from internet-connected systems. But practical demands to monitor operations in real time, glean data analytics from the plant floor and perform remote maintenance have in many cases exposed vulnerable infrastructure to the other side of the firewall. The result is more web-based hacks of operational technology systems. The bad guys get access to critical infrastructure facilities when corporate devices are inadvertently connected to the internet or a network administrator’s credentials are stolen in a spear-phishing scam.</td>

      <td>From Mill to Marx and on to Keynes, a history of misdiagnosis.</td>
      <td>‘Prophecies about the end of capitalism . . . have dotted the history of modern social science since its inception,” Francesco Boldizzoni observes in “Foretelling the End of Capitalism: Intellectual Misadventures Since Karl Marx” (Harvard, 326 pages, $35). “Almost all of the great social theorists, at one point or another in life, engaged in forecasting.” I am inclined to look favorably on any book purporting to expose the follies of revered intellectuals, and the prospect of a history chronicling end-of-capitalism predictions filled me with anticipation.<br />Mr. Boldizzoni was of course under no obligation to write the book I was hoping he had written, and he has not done so. He accepts his prognosticators’ premise that capitalism is basically a malign system that exacerbates inequality and “turns culture into business and . . . enslaves minds to its logic.” Moreover his explanations for the failure of predictions by Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, Max Weber and John Maynard Keynes, among others, strike this reviewer as hopelessly abstruse and heavily reliant on the economic theories that lured these intellectuals into making foolish predictions in the first place.<br />The abrasiveness of the book’s title, together with the author’s highly self-assured tone, led me to expect a bit more in the way of demolition. Mr. Boldizzoni treats his subjects and their “misadventures” with ample deference. He gently concedes, for example, that Marx’s labor theory of value—the theory that a product or service’s value is determined by the labor required to produce it —was wrong. That’s a pretty important thing to be wrong about for a man whose economic theories dominated half the globe for a century, is it not? Mr. Boldizzoni brushes the problem aside, since it “does not disprove the claim that exploitation and the appropriation of surplus value underlie the wage-labor relation.” It doesn’t disprove a lot of things, but it does prove that Marx was a poor judge of economics and human relations.<br />So reluctant is he to confront the hubris of his subjects’ theories that Mr. Boldizzoni, a professor of political science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, actually does precisely what he criticizes them for doing: He predicts the end of capitalism. “Capitalism will indeed end sooner or later,” he writes, without the slightest sense of irony. He can draw this conclusion, he reasons, because “capitalism is a historically bound formation just like the economic and social systems that preceded it in antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the early modern period.”<br />Is it, though? Mr. Boldizzoni, like almost all writers on the left and some on the right, writes of capitalism as a “system,” sometimes even assigning agency to it, as if it were designed by some nefarious force. It’s never clear what he means by the term. What if the thing intellectuals call capitalism is nothing more than the freedom and order necessary to borrow money for the purpose of advancing money-making enterprises? That state of affairs is not a constant in human history, but neither is it confined to the modern era, and it will not vanish as long as humans populate the planet.</td>

      <td>The former U.S. Olympic gymnastics coach, who died by suicide on Thursday, was once lauded, and then criminally charged, for his treatment of athletes.</td>
      <td>John Geddert, by his own description, was a hard-driving gymnastics coach. A towering figure in the Michigan gymnastics world, he prided himself on his high standards and intensity, and pointed to his gymnasts’ successes as proof of his work.<br />In two dozen felony charges against Geddert unveiled on Thursday, however,  the Michigan attorney general said that Geddert’s brand of coaching was a form of forced child labor. Prosecutors said he physically harmed young athletes through his training methods and terrorized them into performing through injury, for his own profit.<br />Two hours later, Geddert was found dead in a rest area off an interstate highway, ending his transformation in the public eye from the winningest coach in the state to a bully who had enabled his friend Larry Nassar to sexually assault women and girls over three decades.<br />Geddert’s apparent suicide devastated people who hoped to hear Geddert answer to the allegations against him, which also included two sexual assault charges in which he was accused of digitally penetrating a girl between the ages of 13 and 16. His death raised questions about why the charges had been revealed before Geddert was in custody.<br />It also dashed hopes that Geddert would resolve lingering mysteries around Nassar. And the charges against him showed how some types of coaching are now being viewed as a form of child abuse that can also create an environment conducive to sexual assault.</td>

      <td>The 78th Golden Globes will kick off a very socially distanced 2021 awards season. While award ceremonies have taken on a different look during the pandemic, leaving more room for the unpredictable, there are still some things we can be certain of for the big night this Sunday.<br />The Golden Globes will be airing on Sunday, Feb. 28 and begin at 8 p.m. ET. The awards ceremony usually lasts about three hours.<br />The event will be broadcast on NBC and available through the network’s website with a television-provider login. The event will also be available to stream on the Roku Channel, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV, Sling TV and Fubo TV. If you don’t have access to these platforms, many are offering free trials. If you miss the ceremony on Sunday, the event will also be available to watch Monday on NBC’s Peacock service.<br />With more people spending more time at home and movie theaters closed over the last year, there has been no shortage of breakthrough television and films to stream. As a result,  Netflix  is looking at an impressive 42 nominations this year, including Aaron Sorkin’s courtroom drama “The Trial of the Chicago 7.” Another favorite from streaming giant Hulu up for four nominations is Chloé Zhao‘s “Nomadland.” Among the five nominees for best director, three are women including Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) and Regina King (“One Night in Miami”), along with director Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”).<br />Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will be hosting the Golden Globes for the fourth time. However, they will be on different coasts, with Ms. Fey presenting from the Rainbow Room in New York and Ms. Poehler from Beverly Hills, Calif. Guests, nominees and award winners will also be broadcasting live from their respective locations. The comedic duo follows Ricky Gervais, who hosted his fifth Golden Globe awards last year.</td>

      <td>It’s high drama at the Golden Globes this year.<br />The awards show that is supposed to be a little raucous—the frat party on the way to the Oscars—already had a reputation for contentious wins and snubs. But going into Sunday night’s ceremony, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, whose small membership votes on the awards, is facing more serious questions about the diversity of its ranks and the ethics of its prizes.<br />As if all that weren’t challenging enough, the largely virtual telecast must draw viewers without its usual ballroom of movie stars, all during a pandemic, which even on a good day doesn’t leave many people in the mood to pop champagne. The NBC show, co-hosted by Amy Poehler in Beverly Hills and Tina Fey in New York, airs at 8 p.m. Eastern/5 p.m. Pacific.<br />In an alternate universe, the Globes might have finally gotten more respect this year. As the only major award that honors film and TV, the trophies could have looked more relevant than ever, reflecting how viewers in the streaming era are blending their entertainment on small screens at home.<br />“They’ve done an excellent job in making themselves important,” said Hawk Koch, a film producer and former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars. Recent controversies may take a toll, he said, but the Globes remain influential. “People take it kind of half seriously—it’s good for everybody in the industry because it gives us more exposure.”</td>

Additionally, the world’s largest tech firms have flocked to cloud gaming, while in-game spending has grown in recent years to contribute the biggest share of the industry’s revenue.<br />GameStop’s stock skyrocketed in value last month when an online community successfully encouraged hordes of people to buy shares in it and other heavily shorted public companies. Though GameStop’s share price has since fallen dramatically after cresting at $483, it has remained volatile. Friday, shares traded around $110 apiece, more than double last Friday’s close of nearly $41.<br />A yearslong slide in revenue, executive turnover and strategic missteps have all hurt the Fortune 500 company’s competitive standing. Two years ago, GameStop failed to sell itself and then pledged to become more relevant in an industry that was years into a digital transition.<br />One of its largest shareholders and newest board members, Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen, is pushing to overhaul the business. GameStop Chief Executive Officer George Sherman has said the company aims to be the “leading” retailer across digital and physical channels for all things gaming and entertainment.</td>

      <td>The world’s largest chain of cinemas found some unlikely allies in its quest to stay afloat through the pandemic</td>

No one was more surprised by the turn of events than AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron.<br />“I was completely oblivious to GameStop,” Mr. Aron said. “I had never heard of them.”<br />In late January a group of renegade individual investors banding together on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets turned their attention to AMC following their successful campaign to pump up the stock of GameStop. For AMC, the attention was far-fetched even for a company that depends on fictional Hollywood story lines to lure people into its theaters. It wasn’t so long ago that a bankruptcy filing loomed as its likely finale.<br />In the span of 72 hours, AMC’s stock soared 467%. The hashtag #SaveAMC proliferated on social media, attached to memes showing images of AMC theaters superimposed on the surface of the moon—a symbol that Reddit traders use to represent their aspirations of the stock reaching stratosphere-busting heights. The mania helped AMC bag another $305 million from the stock market and slash its debt load by $600 million. After dipping back down to as low as $5.35 following the January peak, AMC shares rose again this week amid a new burst of meme-heavy social media attention. The stock climbed 41% through Friday, closing at $8.01.<br />What happened to AMC is a testament to a new force in financial markets: small-time investors whose collective power, often fueled by social media hype, can help determine a company’s fate.</td>

On Friday, her first full day on the job, Mr. Biden visited Texas to talk with local leaders about an Arctic chill that brought the state’s grid near a catastrophic collapse.<br />Ms. Granholm pointed to Texas and blackouts last year in California that she said illustrate how the U.S. electricity system struggles with increasing demand and extreme weather. In one of her first interviews since winning Senate confirmation Thursday, she also said that the demands of the modern economy—envisioned by the Biden team as running on low-emissions technologies—will require federal support for the energy sector.<br />“If we’re going to add the gigawatts of clean energy to the grid that we need to in order to do electric vehicles, in order to accommodate all of the data centers that are being added, we have got to invest…and harden the grid,” Ms. Granholm said, referring to the growth of the internet industry and cloud computing.<br />Ms. Granholm said one of her top priorities is to use the department’s loan program to jumpstart her work. The program offering federal loans and loan guarantees to start-ups and energy projects has $40 billion authorized by Congress but untouched by the Trump administration. That can be funneled into companies bringing new energy technologies to market, especially for power units, battery storage and grid improvements, among others.</td>

The 10-year yield rose more than 0.3% in February for the largest one-month rise since November 2016.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed sharply on Thursday as a weekslong selloff intensified—fueled by bets that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates earlier than previously expected in response to what investors widely expect to be a burst of economic growth and inflation later this year.<br />The 10-year yield logged its largest one-day gain since Nov. 9 during Thursday’s session to finish at its highest closing level in a year. The five-year yield, which is more sensitive to the near-term outlook for interest rates, experienced its largest one-day gain in more than 10 years.<br />Higher yields, though, helped investors regain their appetite for Treasurys on Friday. Demand was also boosted by it being the last trading session of the month, when many fund managers buy Treasurys to match the adjustments in their benchmark bond indexes.</td>

John Milton argued for truth: “Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter?” The answer to that question is this: Truth has nothing to fear from error in a free exchange of ideas, and therein lies the challenge we face in our current reality. In today’s world there is little opportunity for such a free exchange of ideas, whether in the academy, social media or even in the formation of government policy.

They saw the doctrine as the only legal bulwark protecting the president against savage attacks from the three major networks. With all the controversy, President Reagan asked for a briefing. With a group of hostile advisers looking on, I explained that the plain language of the First Amendment meant that the press that used air and electrons must be as free as the press that used paper and ink. The president listened intently. A key adviser spoke up. With stiff opposition from his conservative base, at the least, he warned, Reagan should stay out of the fight.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration plans to allow a sweeping Trump-era rule aimed at combating Chinese technology threats to take effect next month, over objections from U.S. businesses, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The rule, initially proposed in November, enables the Commerce Department to ban technology-related business transactions that it determines pose a national-security threat, part of an effort to secure U.S. supply chains. Companies in technology, telecommunications, finance and other industries say the rule could stifle innovation and hurt competitiveness, and had expected it to be delayed as the administration undertakes a broad review of U.S. policy on Chinese technology.<br />Now the administration is planning to go forward with the rule, the people said. Administration officials are concerned that blocking or diluting the rule would send the wrong message about the new administration’s approach to China, potentially fueling criticism that it is taking a weaker approach, according to the people.<br />One person familiar with the matter said administration officials have signaled to the business community that they won’t enforce the rule aggressively. That could soften the impact, although business representatives say the rule will still subject firms—especially smaller ones—to significant new compliance costs and uncertainty. Another person familiar with the matter said the administration hasn’t said it would hold back in enforcing the rule.<br />The rule is “unworkable for U.S. businesses in its current form and should not be considered for final publication without significant revisions,” said the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs of major companies from Amazon.com Inc. and Citigroup Inc. to Walmart Inc., in a comment filed with the Commerce Department in January. International Business Machines Corp. said the rule as written was “massively overbroad” and would harm the economy while failing to enhance U.S. national security.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the operation to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi that resulted in his death in 2018, a U.S. intelligence report says.<br />In response, the U.S. is preparing to levy sanctions against a group of Saudis implicated in the killing, though not Prince Mohammed himself, a senior U.S. official said.<br />The public release of the report and the measures to punish those involved in the killing are the latest step in President Biden’s “recalibration” of ties with Saudi Arabia, which includes pressing Riyadh to help end a devastating civil war in Yemen and improve its human rights record while maintaining strategic cooperation.<br />The report publicly implicates the de facto head of state of a major strategic ally in a homicide. But none of the U.S. penalties will target Prince Mohammed directly, nor has the U.S. threatened broader measures such as a trade embargo or a withdrawal of support in Saudi Arabia’s proxy conflict with Iran or its role in the Yemen civil war. A senior administration official said the U.S. is eager to avoid a rupture of relations, but “we’ve also made clear that this administration will not sweep anything under the rug.”<br />The senior official, speaking before the report’s release, said the Biden administration values the 75-year strategic partnership with the oil-rich kingdom but “the reality here in the United States and in Washington is that the Saudis have just lost both political parties, support of the American people.”</td>

      <td>House prepares to pass its version of the bill after setback on wage issue from Senate parliamentarian</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats tried to salvage a worker-pay increase after the existing minimum wage proposal was ruled out of bounds in the Senate, exploring a major change to the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 aid package as the House prepared to pass its version of the bill.<br />House passage of the relief plan, expected later Friday, will send the legislation to the Senate, where lawmakers will alter it. The House will then need to approve the amended bill before sending it to President Biden’s desk. Democrats are racing to finish the package before March 14, when certain types of federal unemployment assistance are set to expire.<br />The relief plan would enhance and extend federal unemployment benefits, provide $350 billion to state and local governments, send a $1,400 check to many Americans and fund vaccine distribution, among other measures. Republicans have largely lined up against the legislation, attacking it as too large and wasteful, in particular its provisions for school funding and state and local governments, as the economy shows signs of recovery.<br />The minimum-wage effort, which would raise the rate to $15 an hour by 2025, was thrown into doubt after a ruling from the Senate parliamentarian late Thursday effectively barred Democrats from including the measure as part of the plan. The nonpartisan parliamentarian said that raising the minimum wage wouldn’t comply with the body’s rules for legislation passed through a process called reconciliation, which allows a bill to be approved with 51 votes but requires that it be closely tied to the budget.<br />The finding created a political stress test for Democrats, who have largely remained united in the early weeks of Mr. Biden’s term.</td>

      <td>Growing up in India, Vandi Verma admired Spock on ‘Star Trek’ and wanted to be an engineer. Now she drives the NASA rover exploring the red planet.</td>
      <td>There’s some confusion about the time at which Vandi Verma and I are supposed to connect on Zoom. She’s in Pasadena, Calif., and I’m in New York. I assume there’s been an Eastern vs. Pacific clock-mix-up, but Ms. Verma doesn’t think about time “that way.” Instead, she says, “I usually check whether somebody’s talking about Earth time or Mars time.”<br />Ms. Verma has good reason to pay heed to the time on Mars, currently 134 million miles away. She’s the chief engineer of robotic operations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Perseverance rover, which landed on Mars on Feb. 18. The sight of NASA scientists cheering the successful descent from their control room at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory lifted American hearts. But there were “many fewer people in the room,” she tells me, than when the last rover, Curiosity, reached the red planet in 2012: “There had to be distancing this time because of the pandemic. So there were people in other rooms, and others observing remotely.”<br />Ms. Verma and her team are responsible for “everything to do with the mobility of the rover,” which includes driving and navigation as well as operating the robotic arm that gathers rock and core samples on Mars. They also oversee the Ingenuity helicopter, a small, autonomous rotorcraft that weighs 4 pounds and spans 4 feet. “This will,” she tells me, “be the first aircraft to attempt powered, controlled flight on another planet.”<br />Ms. Verma does some of the driving of Perseverance herself, often remotely from home thanks to Covid. Her 18-month-old twins, Arjun and Anya, are usually home, so they’re often on Mars time, too, “although it’s sometimes hard to manage them.” Fortunately, her husband, a systems engineer at JPL, is on hand to help. Ms. Verma thinks she has it easy. Some colleagues have more-taxing “Earth-time counterparts in their life”—significant others and older children who have a hard time coexisting on cross-planetary clocks.<br />A Mars day, called a sol, is 40 minutes longer than an Earth day, so the time difference changes every day. “You try to get synchronized with Mars, instead of Earth,” Ms. Verma says. “So we’ll eat breakfast at 10 p.m. if that’s when it’s breakfast time on Mars, and dinner at 5 a.m. if it’s night there.” She tries to avoid “Earth light when it isn’t daytime on Mars, because it helps a lot with your circadian rhythm.” Ms. Verma has been driving Mars rovers since 2008, so she has some advice for rookies: “No matter how dark your curtains are, they aren’t ever dark enough to keep the light out. So it helps to put tinfoil on the windows, to completely block the light.”</td>

      <td>Nostalgia can bring comfort and meaning, even inspiration. It’s about the future more than the past.</td>
      <td>Nostalgia has a bad reputation. Some people view it as unhealthy, a mental weakness signifying fear of change and progress. Many see it as a form of escapism, a feeling that people enjoy because it takes them away from reality and back to their youth. I’ve even heard it argued that nostalgia is bad for business, as companies need to focus on the present and prepare for the future, not dwell on the past.<br />A growing body of research indicates that all these intuitions about nostalgia are wrong. Reflecting nostalgically on the past is a common and healthy experience that helps people find the inspiration and confidence needed to move forward in life, particularly during difficult times. I would go so far as to say that nostalgia is about the future more than the past.<br />The term was coined in 1688 by Swiss physician Johannes Hofer to capture what was believed to be a medical condition mostly confined to Swiss mercenaries longing for their mountain home while fighting wars in the lowlands of Europe. Symptoms included deep sadness, bouts of weeping, fainting, stomach pain, disordered eating, fever, heart palpitations and suicidal thoughts. This medical-disease framing persisted through the 18th and 19th centuries, though diagnoses expanded beyond the Swiss. With the arrival of the 20th century, nostalgia was no longer treated as a physical disease but began to be thought of as a psychological ailment with symptoms we might associate today with anxiety and depression.<br />Later in the 20th century, some scholars began to see nostalgia in a more sympathetic light, distinguished from the more unpleasant state of homesickness. Consumer psychologists and marketing researchers documented ways in which sentimentality toward the past predicted product preference and consumer decisions. But we hadn’t yet conducted the systematic studies needed truly to understand nostalgia. This changed in the first decade of this new century when researchers, including my team, approached the study of nostalgia using the modern tools of behavioral science.<br />We observed that nostalgia doesn’t cause distress. Instead, distress causes nostalgia. External cues such as running into an old friend, seeing an old photo on  Facebook ,  or hearing music from one’s youth can trigger nostalgia, but when it comes to internal psychological triggers, people tend to experience nostalgia in response to feeling sad, lonely, meaningless and uncertain about where they are in life.</td>

Founders could save money on rent and hire employees wherever they want to live.<br />Going cloud-only may not be for all companies. Even in the software sector, where the work doesn’t generally involve designing and building tangible objects, there are a host of challenges to dispensing entirely with offices. These range from learning the communication habits of colleagues who never met in person to fostering the kinds of relationships it takes to fundraise from afar. Decades of research point to the power of proximity, augmenting the lore around Silicon Valley, and the birth of the world’s most successful companies.<br />But some startup founders, like Alan d’Escragnolle, aren’t struggling with trade-offs and are finding the benefits of remote work worth it: He said his team brainstorms just as well remotely and that employee productivity hasn’t suffered.<br />A year ago, Mr. d’Escragnolle was set to join his co-founder at Filmhub, an online film-distribution startup, in Los Angeles to sign an office lease and start hiring. Instead, he ended up renting a ski house in Lake Tahoe, and has been running the company from there since March.</td>

      <td>Erik Satie’s ‘Gymnopédies,’ all composed in 1888, have had an impact on the music of the 20th century and today that belies their modest scale</td>
      <td><br />Even amid the tornado of cultural experimentation that defined La Belle Epoque—those four fertile decades in France that preceded World War I—Erik Satie (1866-1925) was a singularly windy eccentric. He declared himself not a musician but a “phonometographer.” He was almost a parody of a bohemian, strolling Paris streets in his frock coat and hat, his beard unkempt and his hair long. Living alone in shabby conditions, working intermittently as a pianist in cafes in the early 1890s, collecting umbrellas, Satie had made good on his college teacher’s designation of him as “the laziest student at the Conservatoire.”<br />Yet this notoriously idiosyncratic figure had already composed three short pieces that remain among the most popular, influential and lovely piano works produced in the 19th century. Their name is characteristically bizarre: the “Gymnopédies,” derived from the Gymnopaedia—the festival where naked young men in ancient Sparta participated in war dancing. The title is deceptively complicated; the “Gymnopédies” are austere works.<br />Though all three pieces were composed in 1888, when he was still in his early 20s, Satie published the “Gymnopédies” separately over the next seven years. They were first performed separately at the Chat Noir in Montmartre, a cabaret where Satie became a pianist. The only available evidence of their reception comes from the newsletter of the Chat Noir: “We cannot recommend this essentially artistic work highly enough to the musical public,” it read. “It may rightly be considered as one of the most beautiful of the century that has witnessed the birth of this unfortunate gentleman.” Satie almost certainly wrote that notice himself.<br />At the time he composed the “Gymnopédies,” French music was still huddling defensively in the enormous shadow of Wagner’s operas. The German Romantic had died five years earlier, but even from the grave he would influence the French music scene for the next 20 years or more. With its stripped-down plainness, Satie’s suite was as contrary to the German composer’s grandiose symphonies as it was possible to be.</td>

      <td>Movie-theater chain has stayed out of the meme-stock spotlight that has glared on rival AMC</td>
      <td>Among U.S- based movie-theater chains,  AMC Entertainment  has definitely provided more entertainment of late. But Cinemark’s comparatively boring show might be more worth tuning in to.<br />Texas-based Cinemark has been overshadowed by the attention investors have focused on its competitor. Next to  GameStop ,  AMC has become perhaps the second hottest in a crowd of so-called “meme stocks” favored by the WallStreetBets crowd on Reddit. Before Cinemark’s fourth-quarter results Friday morning, AMC shares were up 291% so far this year compared with about 31% for Cinemark.<br />AMC’s weaker financial footing seemed to be a draw for the risk-addicted YOLO crowd, who saw the company as teetering on bankruptcy and as a possible investment or buyout target by a bigger Hollywood player. Cinemark by contrast has long been considered the most financially stable of the major theater chains. Michael Pachter of Wedbush wrote to clients earlier this week that he expects Cinemark “to come out of the pandemic relatively unscathed.” Of AMC, he predicted, “it will be years before AMC is able to revisit its prior growth strategy as it repays its growing mountain of debt.”<br />Cinemark’s fourth-quarter revenue plunged 88% from a year earlier to $98.2 million, and attendance was about 10% of the prior year’s comparable period. The company said it burned about $65 million in cash a month during the quarter. Still, revenue well exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, thanks in part to some innovative moves such as private watch parties, where families or other small groups rent a full auditorium for $99. These accounted for 24% of U.S. admissions revenue for the quarter. The company also says its “cash runway” extends into the fourth quarter, and even into 2022 including the tax refunds it expects to receive.<br />Cinemark has good reason to be more upbeat since its last report on Nov. 5, which came just days before news of the first major coronavirus vaccine breakthrough. A growing pace of vaccinations and plunging infection rates is allowing New York theaters to start reopening March 5, and Cinemark Chief Executive Mark Zoradi said Friday he expects the key markets of Los Angeles and San Francisco to begin reopening “in the coming weeks.”</td>

Mr. Trump’s image is splashed all over this year’s conference, where MAGA paraphernalia is abundant.<br />“We have a party led by Donald J. Trump,” said Ohio Senate candidate Josh Mandel, who criticized “squishy Republican governors” who had implemented widespread restrictions to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Mandel, one of many Trump-aligned candidates who have announced campaign bids in recent weeks, called himself “pro-gun, pro-life, pro-Trump.”<br />Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, touted his keep-the-economy-open approach to Covid-19, championed by Mr. Trump during his time in office. The annual CPAC event is typically hosted near Washington but relocated to Florida, where state Covid-19 restrictions allow for mass gatherings like CPAC to occur indoors, something Mr. DeSantis and others applauded Friday. CPAC organizers have limited the number of attendees because of Covid; in the past, more than 10,000 people have attended. The event is also being streamed online.<br />The governor also cited a need for strict enforcement of immigration law, including the border wall advocated by Mr. Trump, to curb the flow of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. “We cannot—we will not—go back to the days of the failed Republican establishment of yesteryear,” Mr. DeSantis said.</td>

      <td>Robinhood Markets Inc. is in talks to pay a fine to settle investigations into its options-trading practices and outages the stock-trading app suffered in March 2020, according to a securities filing.<br />The Securities and Exchange Commission, state regulatory authorities and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s self-regulatory arm, are examining Robinhood’s conduct in those matters, including how Robinhood “displays cash and buying power to customers and its options trading approval processes,” the company said in the filing.<br />Separately, New York’s financial regulator and attorney general, among other regulators, are looking into instances of unauthorized actors taking over the accounts of Robinhood users.<br />Two subsidiaries—Robinhood Financial and Robinhood Securities—are currently negotiating a settlement with Finra over the outages and the options-trading practices, which could include charges of violations of Finra rules, a fine, restitution to customers and the hiring of a compliance consultant.<br />The probes could lead to losses of at least $26.6 million, according to the filing.</td>

      <td>Artist Alexis Rockman creates vividly realistic pictures of doomed vessels from history and mythology.</td>
      <td>The roots of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass., date back to 1799, when a group including local ships’ captains established a “cabinet of natural and artificial curiosities” to display the treasures they had accumulated in their voyages. Starting March 6, a new exhibition will display images of a sailor’s greatest nightmare. In “Shipwrecks,” contemporary artist Alexis Rockman turns his vivid, realistic style to scenes of cannibalism, ice, drifting animals and doomed men.<br />The show, which moves in a larger version on June 13 to Guild Hall in the Hamptons, includes canvases and watercolors representing episodes from history and myth. One picture portrays the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in the Pacific in the last weeks of World War II, including the shark attacks on surviving sailors. Another features threats that might have kept a Viking sailor up at night: ship-destroying whirlpools, threatening whales and the mythical sea-monster known as the Kraken, all about to overpower a small, fragile boat.<br />The “Shipwrecks” series is a departure for the 58-year-old Mr. Rockman, who is best known for his apocalyptic panoramas of climate change, pollution and species extinctions. In one of his best-known works, “Manifest Destiny” (2004), the ocean has submerged the Brooklyn waterfront, and the arches of the Brooklyn Bridge crumble before our eyes.<br />Why focus on shipwrecks? Mr. Rockman points out that in 19th-century New England, paintings of wrecks were a popular genre, and today there’s “nothing more cliché than a shipwreck painting over a mantelpiece.” He loves the challenge of putting new life into an old genre supposedly “not worthy of reconsideration.”<br />The earliest painting in the show, “The Sinking of the Brig Helen” (2017), portrays a famous episode in the history of biology. Alfred Russel Wallace, a contemporary of Darwin’s who independently worked out the theory of natural selection, was on board the Helen when it sank, returning to England from a four-year collecting trip in South America. Wallace survived but lost his collection of thousands of specimens, including living birds and monkeys.</td>

      <td>Yes, but beware the many hurdles.<br />While much of Europe still remains closed to American tourists, a number of Caribbean, South and Central American, and African countries have re-opened their borders to U.S. travelers. That said, the entry requirements are all over the map, ranging from proof of a negative Covid-19 test to mandatory self- isolation to the need to adopt electronic trackers. What’s more, the U.S. State Department warns that foreign governments could change their restrictions with little notice, which means trip plans can easily go awry and Americans overseas might face unforeseen challenges coming back to the U.S.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which still maintains that staying home is the surest way to avoid getting or transmitting Covid-19, has issued country-specific advisories. More than 150 countries, including much of Europe, fall under the CDC’s sternest Level 4 advisory, which recommends avoiding all travel.<br />As of Jan. 26, international travelers face another obstacle: All airline passengers flying into the U.S., including U.S. citizens, must present a negative Covid-19 test taken within three days of their departure from a foreign country or proof of recovery from coronavirus. Show up at the airport overseas for your departing flight empty-handed and you won’t be allowed on the plane. For more on which countries currently welcome American travelers, see “Where Can I Travel Internationally and Do I Need the Covid-19 Vaccine?”<br />No. The closure of the U.S.-Canada border was extended once again until at least Feb. 21, which means tourists are still prohibited from entering Canada by sea, plane, car or other means. Canadian citizens, permanent residents or relatives of Canadians citizens or permanent residents are allowed into the country, but they need to show proof of a recent Covid-19 test and they’ll still be required to quarantine for 14 days.</td>

      <td>U.S. drops Trump-era proposal opposed by European nations seeking higher taxes on technology companies</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. dropped a Trump administration demand in global corporate-tax negotiations, removing one obstacle to an agreement on adapting the tax system to the digital economy.<br />Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday that the U.S. would no longer insist on a “safe harbor” under which some elements of the tax rules would be optional. The idea, proposed in late 2019 by her predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, drew objections from European counterparts, though talks on how it would work never advanced very far.<br />Ms. Yellen made her remarks to finance ministers of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging-market economies at a virtual meeting. According to a Treasury official, Ms. Yellen said the U.S. would continue to engage on both parts of the tax project being led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development: a push to redefine where corporate income is taxed and a parallel effort to impose minimum taxes.<br />Ms. Yellen’s decision doesn’t guarantee that a deal will be reached. The global talks have moved in fits and starts for years, driven by European countries’ frustrations that U.S. technology companies such as  Facebook Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.  have such a large presence in their economies but pay relatively little in corporate taxes.<br />Corporate profits are taxed where value is created, not where customers are located. Negotiators have sought to give countries where international companies operate more power to tax them. In the absence of a deal, some have imposed digital-service taxes that are levies on the companies’ revenue from those jurisdictions.</td>

      <td>Savings rates have spiked and many American households are sitting on large cash balances</td>
      <td>As a group, Americans have amassed an astounding amount of savings during the pandemic. A lot of that money rests in the bank accounts of the rich, but—and this is crucial—not all of it.<br />The Commerce Department on Friday reported that personal income shot up a seasonally adjusted 10% in January from December, buoyed by the latest round of pandemic-relief payments. Spending rose strongly, too, but with a gain of 2.4% from the prior month, not by nearly as much. And with that, the personal saving rate—or saving as a share of after-tax income—shot to 20.5% from 13.4%. That marks its highest level since May. The only time the saving rate was higher before the pandemic was during World War II.<br />The elevated savings rate isn’t just about government payments. It also stems from the weakness in services spending that has occurred during the Covid-19 crisis as people have forgone things like vacations and dining out. Friday’s report showed that services spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of all consumer spending, was down 5.3% from its year-earlier level.<br />The high saving rates that have been in place since the pandemic began have added up to a lot more cash on household balance sheets. Federal Reserve figures show that as of the end of the third quarter households had $2.2 trillion more in cash and cash equivalents than at the end of 2019. That amount is undoubtedly higher now and, with another round of government relief in the works, could go higher still. As the pandemic eases, there will be plenty of money to spend.<br />The rub is that, when it comes to absolute dollar amounts, it is wealthier households that have amassed the most savings. They have had an easier time keeping their jobs during the crisis, and they had the most discretionary spending to cut back on. So there is a case to be made that if the pandemic eases, it will be companies that cater to the better off that will do best.</td>

      <td>As he chafes against the pandemic’s restrictions, the country legend has released two albums while overseeing a radio channel and two cannabis companies</td>
      <td>You might think that Willie Nelson, at age 87, would enjoy a chance to slow down his constant touring, after decades of playing about 150 shows a year, two weeks on and two weeks off. But when Covid-19 shut down live performances last year, the self-proclaimed “road dog” didn’t repair to his Texas ranch or his Maui home to relax and wait things out.<br />“This is the worst time of my life,” he says. “I have never been this frustrated. I try to think positive, but I feel like I’m in jail—I can’t go here, I can’t go there—and that really pisses me off.”<br />Mr. Nelson remains strikingly prolific, averaging about a new album a year while also writing books. He also oversees a SiriusXM channel called Willie’s Roadhouse and two cannabis companies: Willie’s Reserve, which sells a range of products with THC (the principal intoxicating compound in cannabis) and says it operates “under a simple philosophy: my stash is your stash,” and Willie’s Remedy, which features hemp-based “wellness products,” including CBD-infused coffee, tea and lotions.<br />“That’s Life,” a big-band tribute to Frank Sinatra released Feb. 26, is Mr. Nelson’s second release of the pandemic, following last July’s sparse, elegiac “First Rose of Spring.” That album made its debut at number five on the Billboard country album chart—Mr. Nelson’s staggering 53rd top-10 album, making him the only artist to have a top-10 country album in seven straight decades, from the 1960s to the 2020s.<br />That run is particularly amazing for an artist who, early in his career, was sometimes considered too stark, idiosyncratic or downright weird to make it as a country performer. Mr. Nelson’s first triumphs were as a songwriter, most notably with Patsy Cline’s 1961 take on his ballad “Crazy,” which became one of the biggest jukebox hits of all time. He recorded as a solo artist from 1962-72 but didn’t find consistent success until he ditched Nashville, haircuts, suits and alcohol in favor of Texas, long braids, jeans and joints.</td>

      <td>THE COVID-19 pandemic squashed countless dreams around the world. But it also helped a few come true.<br />Laurie Beijen’s family had long wanted to move from San Francisco to Spain for a year. Her husband had been able to do it twice as a child, thanks to the sabbaticals his professor father took, and he wanted his kids to have a similar formative experience.<br />“We never figured out how we could make it work,” said Ms. Beijen, 46, who manages rental properties. Last fall, with Ms. Beijen and her husband both working remotely and their kids, 11 and 9, in school two days a week, an ambitious plan emerged. “We were like, we can either sit here and have Groundhog Day every day, like we’ve been doing for the past several months,” Ms. Beijen said, “or we can do something with this time and really kind of make it matter.” It took a few months to assemble their visa paperwork (“like the biggest term paper I’ve ever done,” she said). They submitted it the day before Thanksgiving, received approval in January and departed a few days later.<br />Now they’re living in a small town outside of Valencia, in southeastern Spain. The modernized farmhouse the family rented is surrounded by orange and avocado trees; on weekends they visit nearby beaches and castles. The kids attend a private British school nearby—in person, five days a week. “So far so good,” Ms. Beijen said.<br />The Department of State estimates that some 9 million U.S. citizens live outside of the country. When Covid-19 closed borders and triggered restrictions around the world, thousands of them returned home—even diplomats, as some 6,000 were evacuated with their families. But other Americans are bucking the trend, leaving the U.S. to live overseas for anywhere from a few months to indefinitely. A number of hotels and resorts have been capitalizing on the appeal of extended stays, offering discounts and upgrades for bookings that are over 14 days or a month. Luxury travel company Embark Beyond launched an Embark Longer program, which offers discounts and amenities such as unlimited laundry service for resort and villa stays upward of a month. “We have clients staying several months in places like St. Barts and even Ireland,” said Jack Ezon founder of Embark Beyond. And several countries are offering special streamlined visa programs that allow foreigners to work legally for several months or a year (see “Stay Awhile” below).</td>

But the plan quickly took on water when the buyers were informed that they had to comply with maritime law, such as being insured and paying premiums in fiat currency.<br />“Unfortunately, we will not be able to proceed because of archaic big insurance companies that cannot adapt to innovative new ideas,” wrote Ocean Builders Chief Executive Grant Romundt in an email to investors.<br />According to a Facebook fan page, MS Satoshi was sold for scrap and was last reported to be steaming to a yard in India to be broken up.</td>

That places Birkenstock in the Arnault family portfolio alongside  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE ,  the globe-spanning luxury conglomerate that Mr. Arnault controls.<br />“We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage,” Mr. Arnault said.<br />The investment is a sign of how the fashion world has come around to a brand that it once snubbed as the unglamorous footwear of granola-eating hippies.<br />Boot maker Johann Adam Birkenstock founded the company in 1774, but the sandals first arrived in the U.S. in the 1960s on the feet of Margot Fraser, a dressmaker who grew up in Germany. Ms. Fraser was turned away from shoe stores as she tried to find a distributor for Birkenstock. She eventually ended up selling the sandals out of a health-food store in California.</td>

By the time papers from mainland Australia arrive, the news is about a week old.<br />“Websites are our second stop,” said Kantesha Takai, a 29-year-old small-business owner on the island. “We are very much reliant on giants like Facebook.”<br />Mark Zuckerberg cut off a critical piece in the chain of communication from such regions when Facebook blocked news from the social-media platform across the country, a drastic counterpunch to the Australian government’s plan to force the company to pay news services for the content shared on the site. Though the company reached an agreement earlier this week, the experience of Ms. Takai and her neighbors in a tiny town on a tiny island revealed a side of the world’s largest social-media platform that can be blunt and brutal when challenged in a negotiation.<br />Their past week illuminates a new chapter in the 17-year-old company’s moody adolescence, one that turned the users who make up the platform into collateral damage in the battle between titans running tech companies and those who wish to regulate them.</td>

      <td>American society is more willing than ever before to speak out against racism and to embrace Black history, but we continue to make the fatal mistake of taking the concept of race itself for granted.</td>
      <td>It is a useful and thought-provoking exercise to attempt to explain, in James Baldwin’s apt phrase, the “system of reality” of one’s own country to foreigners. Why, for example, do we venerate the men and women we choose to put on pedestals? Why do we memorize certain dates and not other ones? Why do we recount events from one vantage point and not another? Speaking with someone who shares few if any of your own assumptions about these matters forces you to spell things out step by step and re-evaluate much of what you assume to be normal.<br />In France, where I have lived for the past decade, I find myself frequently discussing America’s at turns maddening and inspiring racial history, which can seem exotic from this side of the Atlantic. When I first arrived in Paris, that meant listening happily and even haughtily to my European interlocutors as they expressed esteem tinged with disbelief at the feat of Barack Obama’s barrier-shattering presidency, which they used as an unflattering measuring stick for their own societies. In the era of Donald Trump, those conversations turned dramatically less admiring and much more perplexed and even pitying. In the wake of the international racial justice movement sparked by George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis while in police custody, and as the author of a book about the need to “unlearn” received habits of thought about racial categorization, I am now constantly being asked to make sense of legacies of oppression and to speculate about how to transcend them.<br />For foreigners not steeped in what the writer Stanley Crouch termed the “all-American skin game,” it can be difficult to grasp why, as many on the left now believe, the best way to rectify the corrosive effects of racial differentiation and discrimination is to find new and better ways to differentiate and discriminate…by race. At Fieldston, a $50,000-a-year New York City private school, children as young as 8 years old are segregated into racial “affinity groups.” On Twitter, viral hashtag movements encourage educators to “disrupt texts” and assign students of all ages only those authors whose complexion, gender or sexuality mirrors their own. Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley declared in 2019 that “We don’t need any more Black faces that don’t want to be a Black voice”—the implication being that even our values and ideas must fit within racialized fences.<br />The scholars (and sisters) Karen E. Fields and Barbara J. Fields have assigned the term “racecraft” to the mental terrain, mores and customs of language that are produced by racism. They see racecraft—and not superficial physical differences—as the engine of America’s pervasive belief in the illusion of race. And so, especially at this time of year, another common question for an American abroad can be: What is the need for Black History Month? Why isn’t U.S. history sufficient?<br />When the pioneering journalist and historian Carter G. Woodson (“the father of Black history”) created Negro History Week in February 1926, in the same month as the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, its reason for being was self-evident. It was an efficient and practical way of increasing public recognition of a community that had been enslaved just two generations prior. It would be almost another 40 years before the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s secured equal citizenship and legal protection for this besieged population. Following the turbulence and violence of that decade, and anticipating the cultural shift toward Black power and nationalism, Black History Month was first proposed by educators and the Black United Students organization at Kent State University in February 1969.</td>

Mr. Graham, a senior managing director, has been with the fund for a decade and was previously global head of credit investments.<br />Mr. Machin, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment banker for two decades, made the trip despite Canadian government advice against travel during the pandemic and amid one of the West’s slowest vaccine rollouts.<br />CPPIB is a crown corporation, meaning it is governed independently from the federal government but is the steward of pension obligations that are government-mandated. Board members are selected by the ministry of finance. Katherine Cuplinskas, a spokeswoman for Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland, said the minister spoke to CPPIB’s board of directors Thursday night about Mr. Machin’s trip to make “clear that Canadians place their trust in the CPPIB and expect it to be held to a higher standard.”<br />“We are very disappointed by this troubling situation and we support the swift action taken by the Board of Directors,” Ms. Cuplinskas said.</td>

      <td>For a subtle creator of imagined worlds, the line between happy and unhappy endings can be hard to define.</td>
      <td>Kazuo Ishiguro once offered a surprising comment about “Never Let Me Go,” his novel—for those who haven’t had it soldered into their memories—about cloned humans who lead relatively ordinary lives into young adulthood, at which point their vital organs are harvested and they die. “I thought it was a very cheerful book,” Mr. Ishiguro said. “It’s a very optimistic view of human nature. People laugh when I say that, and I think it’s very unfair.”<br />Writers often have idiosyncratic perspectives on their work, but I can think of few cases in which public interpretation seems to have diverged so widely from authorial motive. For many readers, the novel, with its disarmingly unaffected narration by a “carer” for organ donors (who will soon become a donor herself), is a work of quiet horror and heartbreak, in which the futility of cloned lives, as the New Yorker’s critic James Wood wrote, “forces us to consider the futility of our own.”<br />Yet to Mr. Ishiguro, the dystopian cruelty of his story’s premise is a secondary matter. In the lecture he delivered in Stockholm after winning the 2017 Nobel Prize in Literature, he says that the novel originated with the “central relationships triangle” of the three cloned friends. It is because of their comportment in the full knowledge of their fate—their thoughtfulness, their compassion toward each other, their loyalty and love—that he considers the book a celebration of humanity.<br />Who’s right? Perhaps we have found a key to Mr. Ishiguro’s phenomenal international success by recognizing his novels as open texts, able to accommodate multiple readings. Ironic contrast is a staple of his books. Set against a backdrop of civilizational cataclysm (the bombing of Nagasaki in “A Pale View of the Hills,” for instance, or the genocidal Anglo-Saxon conquest in “The Buried Giant”), the action tends to dwell upon small, insular acts of duty and of decency. The latter are sometimes rationalized as mere distractions from the unpleasantness of facing the former. In Mr. Ishiguro’s most famous book, “The Remains of the Day,” the butler who has devoted his best years to serving a Nazi sympathizer is usually described as a case study in cowardly self-delusion. But the novel would have no pathos if we didn’t also identify real virtues in the butler’s sobriety, attentiveness and self-effacing discretion—qualities, not accidentally, that characterize Mr. Ishiguro’s style of writing.<br />In his new novel, “Klara and the Sun,” there is another uncertain meeting between the horrifying and the heartwarming. This is a return to the kind of science-fictional future of “Never Let Me Go.” Klara, the narrator, is an AF, or Artificial Friend, and the story begins in the boutique shop where she is displayed for the privileged class of children who are expected to own such luxury companions. Klara is purchased for Josie, a sweet, sickly teenage girl who lives with her harried mother and a housekeeper outside the city. Klara’s job is to keep Josie’s spirits up as she battles her illness, and on the simplest level this is a fairy tale about the animating power of love between a child and her toy, similar to “The Velveteen Rabbit” or “Toy Story.”</td>

      <td>While he explored the pleasures of the flesh, Bacon’s art plumbed the terrors of the soul.</td>
      <td>In the spring of 1949, the press baron Viscount Rothermere gave a ball that defied Britain’s postwar decline. The men wore white tie, the women their family jewels. The Queen Mother was there, and so was the royal of the moment, Princess Margaret. Late that night, the princess, giddy with Champagne, took the mic from Noël Coward and delivered her party trick. Her Royal Highness began to sing, off-key and out of time. The revelers loyally cheered and called for more.<br />Margaret was just beginning to mutilate “Let’s Do It” when a “prolonged and thunderous booing” emerged from the crowd. The band stopped, and the princess reddened and rushed from the room. “Who did that?” Lady Caroline Blackwood asked the man at her side. “It was that dreadful man, Francis Bacon,” he fumed. “He calls himself a painter but he does the most frightful paintings.”<br />More than a decade before the end of the “Lady Chatterley” ban and The Beatles’s first LP, the iconoclasm of Francis Bacon announced a new era in British life. By his death in Madrid in 1992, Bacon was a social and artistic icon, his battered face the image of painterly tradition. Openly gay, he was the king of Soho, a nocturnal drinker and cruiser, his motto “Champagne for my real friends, real pain for my sham friends.” By day, alone in his studio, he was the exposer of torn flesh and gaping mouths, of the secret shames and spiritual collapse that, in the postwar decades when French thinkers ruled in concert with French painters, made him the only truly English existentialist.<br />With “Revelations,” Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan enter a biographical field as crowded as the Colony Room on a Friday night. Almost all the revelations are already revealed: the Baconian literature includes testimonies from Bacon’s critical patron David Sylvester; his fellow artist and slummer Lucian Freud; his drinking friend Dan Farson; and his assistant Michael Peppiatt. Mr. Stevens and Ms. Swan might, like Bacon’s friends, share a tendency to confuse the man with the art—like Oscar Wilde, Bacon was his own best work—but they bring a sober eye and an organizing mind to Bacon’s “gilded gutter life.” As in their acclaimed “de Kooning,” the authors frame their subject and his work as a portrait of the age.<br />The English existentialist was, naturally enough, Irish. Born in 1909 to a sclerotic, fox-hunting soldier and an errant industrial heiress, the sensitive and asthmatic Francis was raised in as a minority within a minority, the Anglo-Irish gentry that would dissolve amid terrorism and the birth of the Irish Free State in 1922. He later spoke of how he desired the father who despised him for his asthmatic fear of horses; his sexual initiation came from the grooms in the stifling dust of the stables.</td>

      <td>Deeper understanding of our genetic code unlocks an entirely new perspective on longevity.</td>
      <td>On arriving in London to seek his fortune, the rambunctious Scottish physician George Cheyne set about hobnobbing in coffee houses and taverns, where he ate “lustily” and swallowed down “much liquor.” Before long, he had ballooned to nearly 450 pounds. In a state of existential crisis and discerning that his mortality was in the balance, he published a self-help manual, “An Essay of Health and Long Life” (1724). In this bestselling treatise, he singled out tea, coffee, chocolate and snuff as being especially detrimental to the human condition.<br />This seminal work, among others, spawned a tradition of books addressing the topic of longevity which continues to this day. While Cheyne and others contrived innumerable methods designed to maintain good health and extend lifespans, the process of aging has itself invariably been viewed as an immutable part of human nature.<br />No longer, says Andrew Steele in his entertaining and thoughtful book “Ageless” (Doubleday, 352 pages, $29). While we wither and become frail after a mere seven or so decades, the humble Galápagos tortoise bumbles on healthily into a 175-year dotage. Capturing this trait—known as negligible senescence—is the holy grail of aging research.<br />So if, as Mr. Steele contends, “tortoises get old without getting elderly,” might we not master “biological immortality” and become ageless too? Were this achievable, the existence of a bristlecone pine tree in California’s White Mountains, estimated to be an extraordinary 4,850 years old, suggests that such potential extensions to our longevity might be more than mere tweaks. The fact that lifespans of different species vary so greatly—some mayflies emerge, mate and die within 5 minutes, while bowhead whales can live for more than 200 years—indicates that our lifespan is programmed by evolution, rather than restricted by insurmountable constraints.<br />“Ageless” follows biologist George C. Williams’s simple evolutionary explanation for why we age, based on a phenomenon called “antagonistic pleiotropy.” Put simply, genes selected to facilitate early successful reproduction may have detrimental effects as we get older. In Mr. Steele’s words, it looks as if evolution has traded our “future health for increased reproduction.” Were we able to roll the clock back and redesign ourselves, we would doubtless find alternative genetic circuits that did not have these unfortunate consequences. Perhaps one day, Mr. Steele conjectures, we will be able to reprogram our genomes to remove this legacy. Fortunately, there may be more immediately accessible paths to a longer life.</td>

      <td>An impulsive getaway lands Isaiah Quintabe in the middle of a fresh mystery.</td>
      <td>Isaiah ‘IQ’ Quintabe, the young, supersmart consulting detective in Joe Ide’s winning series of idiosyncratic novels, has already seen more than his share of pain and suffering in a relatively brief career. Now, at the beginning of his fifth adventure, “Smoke” (Mulholland, 323 pages, $28), he’s decided he’s had enough. With angry hoodlums out to kill him, Isaiah leaves his home base in East Long Beach, Calif., and drives north: “He was exhausted, mentally and physically. . . . He didn’t want to hear any more victims sobbing and grieving or be around any more gangsters, killers, sociopaths and lunatics. . . . Too much evil. Too much death.”<br />Isaiah impulsively parks his Mustang GT in the Northern California town of Coronado Springs, a place that may offer the chance for spiritual renewal. (“A main street of shops . . . a Spanish-style city hall with a fountain and a courtyard. That seemed a good enough reason to stop, rest up, experiment with this relaxation thing.”) No sooner has he found lodging, though, than his attention is grabbed by an escapee from a mental hospital who claims to be on the trail of a notorious serial killer. Goaded by the “Demon Curiosity,” as Isaiah dubs his own “driving need to know,” the detective finds himself sucked once more into the maelstrom of a perilous investigation.<br />Meanwhile, another murderer—a former hit man and pit bull breeder—has gotten out of prison and has his heart set on assassinating Isaiah, who put him behind bars. Learning Isaiah has left town, this villain turns his attention to the detective’s (now former) girlfriend Grace, an artist whom he hopes to use as bait to lure his nemesis back to Long Beach.<br />Mr. Ide, always a generous plotter, weaves several other storylines into this kaleidoscopic chronicle. Isaiah’s best friend Dodson, in hopes of becoming a proper wage-earner, interns at an advertisement agency where he sees how he might plausibly transform himself from a neighborhood hustler into a bona fide ad man. Deronda, the single mother and food-truck entrepreneur with whom Grace is now living, has her hard-won success and peace of mind jeopardized by an extortionist who threatens to expose her loose-living past in ways that would traumatize her little boy. Grace tries to help Deronda extricate herself from this predicament, even as she struggles to produce new paintings for an upcoming gallery show—and yearns to reunite with Isaiah.<br />Dozens of other wonderfully sketched minor characters—science-fair whiz kids, pimps and prostitutes, working-class heroes, vengeance-bent relatives, sorrowful junkies and idealistic strivers—flesh out this richly imagined and sharply written saga. “Smoke,” which concludes with a cliffhanging crisis, positively demands a follow-up, and fast.</td>

      <td>A single-sex hotel was the means for generations of women to take part in a transforming Manhattan.</td>
      <td>Among the handful of iconic hotels closely entwined with New York’s cultural history, the Barbizon is perhaps less widely known than the Plaza, Algonquin or Waldorf Astoria. But as Paulina Bren’s beguiling new book makes clear, its place in the city’s storied past is no less deserving.<br />The 23-story neo-Gothic Barbizon was built in 1927 on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street as an upscale, clublike residential hotel for ambitious young women who dared to venture to New York on their own to pursue their dreams. Advertised as a safe haven in the big bad city, it offered plenty of what are now known as amenities but were then touted as opportunities for self-improvement—lecture rooms, art and music studios, roof gardens, a library, a swimming pool, a gym, afternoon teas, and an attached coffee shop and pharmacy. All of this, plus the establishment’s no-men-above-the-ground-floor policy (even the elevators were operated by women after sundown), was particularly reassuring to worried parents around the country.<br />The hotel’s private spaces were far less lavish. Its 720 rooms were more convent-like than luxurious, especially by today’s standards. Most were tiny, sparely furnished and without private bathrooms—but for a young woman with the proper references and sufficient funds, they provided a coveted room of her own in midtown Manhattan. And to the delight of guests like early resident Margaret Tobin Brown—a.k.a. the Unsinkable Molly Brown, famous survivor of the Titanic—each had its own radio.<br />Like two other recent cultural histories about outstanding women—Francesca Wade’s “Square Haunting” and Maggie Doherty’s “The Equivalents”—“The Barbizon” zeroes in on a shared experience that proved pivotal in the lives of those it touched. Ms. Bren’s juicy sociocultural history glitters with the names and stories of talented, beautiful young women who passed through the Barbizon’s Italianate atrium lobby on their way to literary and cinematic stardom. Residents included writers Sylvia Plath, Joan Didion, and Diane Johnson, along with actresses Grace Kelly, Ali MacGraw,  Phylicia Rashad, Cloris Leachman, Elaine Stritch and Nancy Davis (later Reagan). When Liza Minnelli stayed there, her mother, Judy Garland, called the front desk repeatedly to check up on her.<br />The hotel was named for the Barbizon School, a 19th-century French art movement centered in the village of Barbizon, a haven for struggling artists southeast of Paris. New York’s Barbizon was conceived as “the rooming choice for the artistically inclined” and for women who sought alternatives to the traditional teaching and nursing jobs that were open to them. It became a launching pad for careers in publishing and business along with modeling and acting—plus a safe perch for meeting potential husbands.</td>

      <td>A collection of linked stories for young readers introduces a resourceful young Nigerian heroine.</td>
      <td>For the aspiring reader, there’s special satisfaction in tackling one’s first “real” book—not a school-issued easy-reader or a picture book, however delightful, such as any younger child might read, but a proper chapter book, compact in size and thrillingly grown-up. There’s ever-greater variety in the offerings for children—6- to 9-year-olds, roughly speaking—who are making the leap.<br />The writer Atinuke sets a witty and observant collection of linked stories in modern Africa in “Too Small Tola” (Candlewick, 89 pages, $15.99), which is cheerily illustrated by Onyinye Iwu (see below). “Tola lives in a run-down block of apartments in the megacity of Lagos, in the country of Nigeria,” we read at the start of each chapter before plunging into the escapades of a resourceful girl who constantly gets chaffed about her small stature.<br />We meet Tola’s soccer-obsessed brother and ambitious elder sister and feel an instant fondness for Grandmommy, the bossy and perceptive head of their household. Lagos itself becomes something of a lead character, with its noises and odors and crowds. In the first story, Tola and her grandmother run errands on foot, winding their way amid “car horns blaring and hawkers shouting” to buy yams and dried fish: “Hundreds of market women shout for people to come and buy their superior goods. Thousands of shoppers scream at the price of those inferior goods.” In the second story, Tola gets unexpected backup from the women of her apartment block when a bully makes her spill the water she’s carrying. In the third, Tola and her brother help an injured tailor complete his work preparing clothes for families celebrating some upcoming holidays. “Too Small Tola” has a diminutive heroine, but it’s a big charmer and treats its newly capable readers with a respect that will make them feel knowledgeable and sophisticated.<br />The events of two other early chapter books—both written by Dori Hillestad Butler, as it happens—transpire amid the more familiar surroundings of American domesticity. A refined and literate cat named Simon and a goofball dog named Baxter write letters to each other in “Dear Beast: The Pet Parade” (Holiday House, 79 pages, $15.99), illustrated with comic flair by Kevan Atteberry.<br />In this epistolary sequel to 2020’s “Dear Beast,” the cat loftily offers the dog the honor of marching in this year’s costumed pet parade with their owner, Andy. “Yay!!!!!! Pet Purrade!!!!!!!!!” Baxter writes, with his terrible spelling. Over nine short chapters, the drama builds as Simon comes to realize that, in having dodged an annual chore, he has cut himself out of a triumphant role. Baxter, meanwhile, is enjoying himself hugely by refusing to tell the cat what costume he will be wearing. The circle of correspondence eventually expands to include a fish, a squirrel, a crow and a snail (he’s the mailman) in this genial narrative of sublimated sibling rivalry.</td>

      <td>A case for connecting St. Thomas Aquinas and Jean-Paul Sartre begins with a question of freedom.</td>
      <td>The distinction between theist and atheist, Joseph S. Catalano argues in “The Saint and the Atheist,” is irrelevant in today’s world. Believers and nonbelievers alike, he thinks, are bound together by a common faith: faith in human freedom. Mr. Catalano claims to find this common faith in the writings of two very different philosophers—the 13th-century Dominican friar Thomas Aquinas and the 20th-century French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre.<br />Mr. Catalano, a Sartre scholar and professor emeritus at Kean University, has written this slim volume as a philosophical guidebook on how to live a meaningful life. He concentrates on a theme in Sartre’s thought that has immediate practical relevance: the difference between good faith and bad faith.<br />According to Sartre, we all experience anguish when we realize the responsibility we bear for the direction of our lives. We can respond to this anguish either in bad faith, by continuing to live as we have lived, or in good faith, by declaring, “No, I wish to change my way of life.” We shape who we are with each decision we take.<br />Mr. Catalano portrays Sartre as a believer in “the reality and force of human freedom.” For Sartre, the radical freedom to fashion ourselves as we wish constitutes human dignity. This capacity for self-making, Mr. Catalano argues, makes each human life “unique, one of a kind, irreplaceable,” a “great happening,” each deserving a 3,000-page biography, like the one Sartre wrote of Gustave Flaubert.<br />Mr. Catalano insists that both a saint and an atheist can instill in us a sense of wonder at “this miracle of life.” Of course, the atheist Sartre tended not to use the word “miracle” to describe human life. Supposing that we inhabit a world without God, Sartre was more inclined to refer to the human being as a “useless passion” whose life and death are meaningless.</td>

      <td>David Weber and Chris Kennedy continue a tale of alien invasion meeting human (and vampire!) resistance.</td>
      <td>Ever since H.G. Wells’s “War of the Worlds” back in 1897, alien-invasion stories have had two parts: There’s the invasion itself, and then there’s the fightback. The problem for writers is that, to make the invasion seem unstoppable, you have to show the Earth’s military powers to be inept—and then you have to think up something totally unexpected that turns the tide. Wells got away with microbes, to which the invaders had no immunity. Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, in their 1985 novel “Footfall,” came up with an atom-bomb-powered spacecraft built on the advice of a consortium of sci-fi writers.<br />In David Weber’s “Out of the Dark” (2010), there were two things that the invading Shongairi hadn’t bargained for. One was the speed of human technological development. The Shongairi were expecting steam power and muskets, not fighter jets and tanks. Still, their weapons could deal with those. What they didn’t know was that there was another intelligent species on Earth besides humans: vampires. Once those bloodsuckers joined the fight, the invaders were doomed.<br />But the Shongairi were only a subordinate race, acting on the orders of the thousand-world Galactic Hegemony, which is still bent on neutralizing humanity. Mr. Weber’s sequel, “Into the Light” (Tor, 511 pages, $28.99), written with Chris Kennedy, features a familiar survivalist scenario as small communities try to stay alive after the Shongairi’s destruction of Earth’s cities and infrastructure. In their quest to rebuild, the survivors re-engineer captured equipment, allowing them to use contra-gravity, low-energy nuclear reactors and construction robots.<br />Restoration is one thing, revenge another. Looking to take the fight to the Hegemony, a group of humans and vampires ventures out into the stars to look for allies. They travel in a spacecraft equipped with railguns and—a tribute to sci-fi’s past—“Heinlein suits,” which make individual infantry soldiers an army on their own.<br />Messrs. Weber and Kennedy are the modern masters of military sci-fi, so much so that if we are ever invaded from space, we can hope that they’ll be commissioned to plan the fightback. They’re heavy on tech and inventive with the fantasy, and they obviously intend to continue the story. To quote the last lines of Robert Heinlein’s own 1951 invasion story “The Puppet Masters”: “The free men are coming to kill you!” Sci-fi has moved on a lot since then, even if the underlying pattern stays the same.</td>

      <td>Selected by Lauren Fox, the author, most recently, of the novel ‘Send for Me.’</td>
      <td>By William Trevor (2002)<br />1. The violent act that sets this novel’s tale in motion takes place in the time known as the Troubles. It’s 1921, and Anglo-Irish landowner Capt. Everard Gault has shot a would-be Irish Republican Army arsonist. Sensing themselves under threat, the Gaults decide to leave Ireland, a plan that proves the undoing of all their hopes for a safe and peaceful life. Their young daughter, Lucy, who has run off on the day of their departure, is ultimately presumed dead. The novel is a long lament, a chronicle of isolation and miscommunication as Lucy lives out her life in her childhood home, believed dead all the while by her family, who have remained abroad. The Irish War of Independence and its aftermath are the setting for this saga, summed up in William Trevor’s description as having “the terrible beauty of a destiny fulfilled” that “trailed a terrible bitterness, which haunted memories long after the conflict ended.”<br />By Sonali Deraniyagala (2013)<br />2. I confess that I put off reading Sonali Deraniyagala’s “Wave” for some time, intimidated by the crushing scope of her tragedy: Her parents, husband, and two young sons died in the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. “Wave” is about the aftermath, but of course it’s also about the before. Ms. Deraniyagala stares into the blinding sun of her losses and refuses to look away. She travels back to the destroyed hotel, where she comes across the shirt her son was wearing; she relives memories of car journeys with her family, the boys kicking each other’s shins; “a gush of starlings”; a new pair of shoes. “The one time I allow my family to come alive, and that shoe trounces me. But I want to linger with them. I want to stay in our car forever.” This book is a merciless reckoning with a history that is barely history, a past that is so close at hand that the author can smell it, hear it, taste it. “I trip up constantly, between this life and that.”<br />By Nora Krug (2018)</td>

When Hindenburg’s report was released—sending the company’s stock sliding—Nikola said it was false and misleading and reiterated that in subsequent statements.<br />Nikola said Thursday that its review of Hindenburg’s allegations found that nine statements by the company or Mr. Milton were wholly or partially inaccurate. Among the things cited by Nikola was the video of the truck moving.<br />Nikola didn’t directly address other allegations in the short seller’s report other than to say: “In other respects, the Hindenburg article’s statements about the company were inaccurate.”<br />The review disputed Hindenburg’s conclusion that the company was a fraud, Nikola said, and outside consultants determined its staffing and technology were appropriate for an early-stage company. The review was commissioned by the company’s board and carried out by outside law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—When Rick Scott spoke by phone with former President Donald Trump last week, the Florida senator told Mr. Trump he needed his help to ensure Republicans win back the Senate majority in 2022.<br />Mr. Scott heads the Senate Republicans’ campaign committee, which is tasked in part with helping re-elect the party’s incumbents. But he didn’t ask Mr. Trump to refrain from endorsing primary opponents against GOP senators whom Mr. Trump has derided as disloyal for publicly criticizing him, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.<br />“No, I never talked to him about that,” Mr. Scott said in an interview. “If endorsements mattered, I wouldn’t have been a governor, and I wouldn’t have been a U.S. senator.”<br />The strategy is characteristic of how Mr. Scott plans to approach a series of competitive primaries that will be the next proving ground in the fight for the future of the GOP.<br />The wealthy businessman and former governor adamantly rejects the narrative that the Republican Party is embroiled in a civil war, even as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) accused Mr. Trump of a “disgraceful dereliction of duty,” and Mr. Trump slammed Mr. McConnell as a “political hack,” pledging to field his own primary rivals.</td>

Revenue dropped as patients went elsewhere for care, Universal Health said, and it incurred expenses to restore its operating systems.<br />The attack on Universal Health and those at other hospitals last year involved ransomware, people familiar with the incident said, a malicious software that shuts users out of their own data.

Universal Health said that it believed the company would be entitled to recoup costs through insurance.

It continued a streak of wins at the distance that track-geek site letsrun.com called “easily the greatest 60-meter hurdles season the world has ever seen.”<br />Even more remarkable than Holloway’s speed, though, is how he’s achieving it.

      <td>GDP expanded by 0.4%, but millions of small businesses and farmers are still struggling</td>
      <td>NEW DELHI—India’s economy, one of the hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, started growing again last quarter, but the recovery is being driven by those with the highest incomes, while the poor are still struggling.<br />The country’s gross domestic product grew by 0.4% in the three months through Dec. 31, driven by India’s biggest companies and richest consumers. They emerged from the worst of the Covid-19 crisis last year with more savings and lower costs, and are now lifting growth as the spread of the virus slows.<br />But the millions of small family businesses and farms that employ more than 80% of the populace and make up the informal economy have had the opposite experience. Its businesses and consumers have had to dip into savings and seen demand disappear, said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive for the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent think tank in Mumbai.<br />“If you are a carpenter or a plumber or a mason or a cart pusher or a hawker, you lose income for the day,” when Covid-19 keeps people at home and companies close, Mr. Vyas said. “The hit is very direct.”<br />India may have had more people pushed back into poverty by the coronavirus than any other country. Lifting the incomes of those near the poverty level will determine the speed and shape of its post-pandemic recovery. Its struggle, even as its daily new infections have plunged to less than a fifth of their peak last year, could foreshadow struggles in other emerging economies.</td>

      <td>Helicopter-taxi hopeful Archer is among those joining the public markets with billion-dollar valuations—years before any revenue</td>
      <td>California aerospace startup Archer Aviation Inc. has a multibillion-dollar vision of flying people around town in autonomous electric helicopter-like vehicles. It doesn’t have revenue or a vehicle ready for passengers, but that hasn’t slowed the three-year-old company.<br />Instead of toiling away in obscurity with a shoestring budget, the traditional way for startups to spend their formative years, Archer became part of the SPAC frenzy gripping Wall Street. This month it announced an agreement to merge with a special-purpose acquisition company, raising $1.1 billion—and gaining a valuation of $2.7 billion.<br />“The SPAC market was actually a really great spot to go to raise a lot of capital in one big swoop,” Archer co-founder and co-CEO Adam Goldstein said. The company is slated to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange in a few months.<br />SPACs have flipped the script on the multidecade model of development for early-stage startups, enabling fledgling companies with little or no revenue to tap public markets sooner. The shift lets amateur investors—long excluded from startup wealth creation—get in on the ground floor of disruptive businesses. It is a dynamic that can lead to huge returns but also carries big risks, as young companies are far more vulnerable to going belly up.<br />Since the start of last year, investors have poured more than $130 billion into SPACs, “blank-check companies” traded on an exchange with the goal of merging with a private company to bring it public. Amateur stock traders and hedge funds alike have piled in, seeking high-growth companies.</td>

      <td>Probably not. Volkswagen’s first EV for the global market is long on curb appeal, light-footed among its competitive set—but comes up a bit short in engineering design, writes Dan Neil</td>
      <td>AS THE PRESENCE of our guest makes clear, global auto makers are starting to get serious about delivering electric vehicles. The 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 crossover ($45,190, as tested) is the blunt-nosed tip of VW Group’s $43-billion spear, the first of a bevy of battery beauties to be built globally on the company’s modular electric platform (MEB) in the next decade, including an EV microbus. Groovy.<br />With its sloe-eyed canopy and high-cut hips, optional LED-illuminated nose and 20-inch alloy Spirographs, the ID.4 is not without curb appeal. By virtue of the mechanism, its drivability beats the silk PJs off a comparable Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, which is the sort of cross-shopping the VW brand is most hoping for. Compared to this light-footed, sweet-singing creature, gas-burning competitors feel like puttering, muttering nincompoops.<br />Which reminds me: Whenever I write about electric cars it stirs up cranks on social media, who have often and with great certainty accused me of being in the pay of Elon Musk and Tesla. Rest assured, the management of the business newspaper of record does not allow reporters, columnists, or editors to profit in any way from the people and companies they cover. Zero, zip, nada. I’ll take my apology off the air.<br />So when I say the ID.4 is five years behind the comparable Tesla, it’s not because I’m an Elon fanboy, a VW hater, or that I have anything to gain or lose personally. That is my best guess, based on my weeklong test drive of VW’s hot-from-the-oven, slightly underbaked strudel.<br />Example: The ID.4’s touch-screen UX is a bit shambolic. The (optional) 12-inch center touch screen takes ages to boot up and can lag behind user inputs. It’s not very pretty, either. The “Car-Net” phone app—a Tesla-like remote interface with the car, accessing charging and climate functions—failed to talk to the car when I tried it several times.</td>

      <td>The home-share giant’s market value beats that of hotels—probably for good reason</td>
      <td>Against all odds,  Airbnb  might be a relatively safe place to rest both your family and your money in 2021.<br />It is true that the stock appears, on its surface, death-defyingly overvalued. With a market value of $120 billion, Airbnb is now worth more than  Marriott International ,   Hilton Hotels & Resorts ,   Hyatt Hotels  and  InterContinental Hotels Group  combined. That is to say, a bet on Airbnb this year reflects a conviction that the homestay market will own the hotel business to a degree that it never quite recovers in full.<br />The home-share giant reported fourth quarter results Thursday—its first report as a public company—showing revenue down just 22% year over year. That is hardly ideal, but it looks fantastic in comparison to its lodging peers. Revenue in the same period was down an average of 61% for Marriott and Hilton, for example, and an average of 65% for major online travel agents  Expedia  Group and  Booking Holdings ,  which derive a significant portion of their business from lodging bookings such as hotels and homestays. Perhaps more important, Airbnb’s business performed significantly better in the fourth quarter relative to its full-year results. Major hotels and online travel agents performed significantly worse.<br />Bottom-line comparisons look positive, too. Airbnb said it lost just $21 million on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $276 million in the same period a year prior. Marriott meanwhile swung to a loss in the fourth quarter and said it lost money for all of 2020 for the first time since 2009.<br />That bodes well for Airbnb’s pace of recovery and consumers’ likelihood to opt toward the safety of a homestay over the exposure of a hotel as the world slowly opens back up. Marriott, for one, is trying to revive its business by branding itself as the destination for “bleisure,”—the blending of post-pandemic work travel with a leisure vacation. But with millions of listings in 100,000 cities world-wide, that is exactly how Airbnb has been used for years. As Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said Thursday, his company is already a noun and a verb in pop culture.</td>

      <td>Slim coupons make much of the recently issued debt with maturities of between 50 and 100 years riskier than traditional bond math suggests</td>
      <td>Rising bond yields pose an outsize threat to one asset class in particular: ultra-long-dated debt.<br />Hopes of a fast economic recovery have given bonds their worst start to the year since 2015. Last October, 10-year Treasury yields were under 0.7%. Now, they hover around 1.5%. The jump has started to dent stocks: The S&P 500 fell 2.4% Thursday.<br />Markets still benefit from very loose financial conditions in inflation-adjusted terms, and the Federal Reserve made clear this week it won’t allow yields to go too high. That offers protection to stock investors, and even most bondholders.<br />The exceptions may be investors that bought debt issues maturing in 50 or more years’ time, particularly those with slim coupons.<br />So far, the big yield shifts are happening at shorter maturities. Yet France’s new 50-year government bond, issued on Jan. 26, has still lost 15% of its value. Over the same period, Austria’s latest 100-year bond has lost 21%. Their yields have only risen 0.4 percentage points.</td>

      <td>Everybody can agree that electricity grids should be more reliable. It will be much harder to agree on what price to pay for that safety.</td>
      <td>Can electricity grids be better prepared for extreme weather? Absolutely. The harder question is: How much are we willing to pay?<br />Grid reliability is getting more attention as extreme cold in Texas caused days of rolling blackouts for its residents. Last summer, a historic heat wave in California led to power shortages in the state. Many are left wondering how electricity grids, such an essential component of a functioning society, could be left so unprepared.<br />It is tempting to try to come up with a neat answer: A certain type of energy source might be to blame—whether wind, solar or natural gas—or the power market design might be responsible. Neither of these is satisfying on its own. A full autopsy will be required to figure out what exactly went wrong in Texas, but at a broad level the issue comes down to cost and risk assessment.<br />The decisions an American family has to make every year about health coverage aren’t all that different than the ones facing electricity planners. One family might prefer cheap insurance with less coverage, knowing full well that an emergency room visit will cost dearly. Another might prefer high fixed payments in exchange for peace of mind.<br />The electricity system is similar, and both Texas’ and California’s deregulated markets have little built-in insurance compared with others. Both are energy-only markets that rely on price signals to make sure enough power is on the grid. Other markets such as ISO-New England and PJM Interconnection, which covers 13 states and the District of Columbia, have capacity markets that offer power plants incentives to be on standby just in case the grid needs it. And then there are states with fully regulated markets where a utility owns or controls the total flow of electricity. In such a market, a utility has an incentive to invest as much as possible in the grid because it can raise the price it charges customers—as long as the state’s utilities commission approves.</td>

      <td>Israel issues passes for going to hotels and gyms; the U.K. may seek proof of a shot or test for bars and offices</td>
      <td>As vaccine rollouts gain momentum, governments world-wide are looking at ways for people to prove they are inoculated against the coronavirus, raising logistical and ethical concerns about whether others will be excluded from daily life.<br />The U.K. government recently announced it will consider whether Britons will need proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test to visit bars, return to the office or attend theaters and sporting events.<br />In Israel, a vaccine passport was launched last week allowing those who are inoculated to go to hotels and gyms. Saudi Arabia now issues an app-based health passport for those inoculated, while Iceland’s government is doling out vaccine passports to facilitate foreign travel. Last month, President Biden issued executive orders asking government agencies to assess the feasibility of creating digital Covid-19 vaccination certificates.<br />Proponents of the plans say they will enable battered economies to reopen, even as vaccines are still being rolled out, allowing people to enjoy leisure activities and go to work safe in the knowledge they aren’t harming others or at risk themselves. It could also act as an incentive for people to get the shot.<br />But the concept is potentially fraught with pitfalls. It could discriminate against minority communities, who are less likely to accept the vaccines, according to national surveys, or young people, who are less likely to be given priority to receive them. There are questions about the ethics of granting businesses access to peoples’ health records.</td>
