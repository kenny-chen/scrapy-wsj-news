But he did get a loan of 60,000 ariary, equivalent to about $16, via his account with French telecom giant  Orange SA .<br />By depositing more money into his mobile money wallet, he qualified for a loan and got an answer to his request for cash in about 10 seconds. He used the digital cash to stock up on rice.<br />“I am thankful…it was helpful in a critical moment,” he said.<br />African consumers have long been paying each other for goods and services on cellphones, making them among the earliest adopters of mobile money services in the world. The pandemic has turbocharged the usage of digital cash. It has also hastened the use of cellphones not just to transfer money, but also to take out loans and deliver government assistance.</td>

But this is just the start of a long journey before they fulfill their transformative potential.<br />Signs of very early-stage commercialization are emerging from the corporate science projects that want to remove human drivers from vehicles. Alphabet’s Waymo seems furthest ahead with its “robotaxi” project in the suburbs of Phoenix Customers used to have to sign a nondisclosure agreement to hail a ride with no backup driver, but Waymo opened the service up in October.<br />Others aren’t far behind. Motional, a $4 billion joint venture between South Korean car giant Hyundai and automotive supplier Aptiv, said last month that it will take safety drivers out of its taxis that operate on the  Lyft  platform around Las Vegas “in the coming months.” Cruise Automation, the driverless-car business controlled by  General Motors ,  has said it would remove backup drivers from its cars by the year-end. Cruise runs vehicles around busy San Francisco, but without passengers or cargo.<br />Doing without safety drivers is an important milestone, but there are plenty more. Once companies have worked out how to operate robotaxis safely in one urban district in good weather, they will need to adapt to new areas and a wider range of conditions. Eventually, this kind of gradual expansion should give driverless cars the scale necessary to drive down costs and compete with human-driven taxis, public transport and, in the very long run, car ownership.</td>

In January, days before the illness was first diagnosed in Europe, he used this knowledge to design a version of the vaccine on his home computer.<br />“The success of Ugur and Özlem is a fantastic combination of two people who complement each other,” said Rolf Zinkernagel, a Swiss Nobel Prize laureate who once employed Dr. Sahin in his Zurich lab. “He is an innovative scientist, and she is an amazing clinician with a great sense for running a business.”</td>

      <td>Bond market weighs whether the central bank will purchase more later-dated Treasurys to provide additional stimulus</td>
      <td>Some investors are betting that the Federal Reserve could start buying more long-term U.S. Treasurys as soon as its next policy meeting, a trend that has helped temper some recent selling and kept yields from rising higher.<br />One factor influencing such bets: the outcome of the Nov. 3 election, which resulted in the strong possibility of divided government in Washington and left investors thinking the Fed might need to assume more responsibility to support an economy increasingly buffeted by a surge in coronavirus cases.<br />Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s decision to not extend several emergency Fed lending programs beyond Dec. 31 also left the Fed with fewer alternatives to Treasury purchases for economic stimulus. Buying bonds helps boost the economy by reducing longer-term Treasury yields, lowering the cost of borrowing for individuals and businesses.<br />Minutes from the Fed’s Nov. 4-5 meeting released last week offered few clues about prospects for policy changes at the central bank’s next meeting on Dec. 15-16. Officials in early November didn’t think it was necessary to make immediate adjustments to their bond-buying program. But they “recognized that circumstances could shift to warrant such adjustments,” the minutes said.<br />Renewed hopes that Congress could pass some sort of coronavirus-aid package in a lame-duck session helped lift the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 0.933% on Tuesday from 0.845% Monday. But that remained below the 0.970% mark it reached three weeks ago, just after  Pfizer Inc.  released highly encouraging results from its coronavirus vaccine trial.</td>

      <td>Even if Covid-19 vaccines become widespread, business travel is likely to be changed by the pandemic. Travel budgets have been slashed and some meetings will remain virtual; conferences and conventions may be crimped.<br />But by how much? It matters not only to airlines and their employees but also their customers—travelers. That’s because higher fares paid by corporate customers actually subsidize cheap fares for vacationers. What’s more, less business travel means that airlines schedule fewer flights on business routes, like trips to New York, Chicago, London and Tokyo. That means fewer seats for leisure travelers.<br />Estimates of permanent change in the airline industry have ranged from the CEOs of American, United and Delta all saying business travel will come roaring back in full, though it may take a few years, to observers like Bill Gates who recently suggested half of all business travel will never return.<br />Guesses aside, a look at data suggests between 19% and 36% of all air trips are likely to be lost, based on a business-travel analysis I worked on with three airline-industry veterans.<br />“Brick-and-mortar retail has been devastated by ecommerce and I think this is a parallel story,’’ says Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorks, an airline-industry consulting firm and a member of our group.

The S&P 500 ended at an all-time high last week, its 26th for this year.<br />Contracts tied to the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 index rose 1%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 1.1%.<br />Investors’ sentiment has been buoyed in recent weeks by the development of Covid-19 vaccines, which could curtail infection levels and let social and business activity return to pre-pandemic levels.<br />“The mood of the market is rather optimistic,” said Eric Barthalon, global head of capital markets research at Allianz. “For the time being, markets have bought the news that vaccines are going to be rolled out earlier than expected.”</td>

      <td>BERLIN— Pfizer Inc.  partner BioNTech and U.S. drugmaker  Moderna Inc.  both applied for their coronavirus vaccines to be approved in the European Union, the EU’s chief medicines regulator said Tuesday, with officials expected to make a decision on at least one of the vaccines by the end of the month.<br />The announcement brings hope that the EU will soon be able to start vaccinating its 448 million people against a disease that has done some of its earliest and worst damage on the continent.<br />The European Medicines Agency said its officials will work through Christmas to review whether data from trials show sufficient proof of the two vaccines’ safety and effectiveness. If so, the vaccines could be marketed as soon as this month, according to people familiar with the discussions. The EMA is set to make a judgment on the BioNTech vaccine first, by Dec. 29 at the latest, giving that candidate a two-week edge in the vaccine race over Moderna’s candidate. The agency will then decide whether to authorize the Moderna vaccine by Jan. 12, officials said.<br />The submission marked a milestone in the race to supply the world with a working vaccine to end the pandemic, said Ugur Sahin, the chief executive of BioNTech.<br />“We will continue to work with regulatory agencies around the world to enable the rapid distribution, should the vaccine receive the approval, contributing to the joint efforts to let the world heal and regain its normal pace of life,” Dr. Sahin said.</td>

      <td>Martin Muoto’s new Black Impact Fund to focus on opportunity zones and nearby areas</td>
      <td>A California developer is trying to raise $1 billion to invest in Black and Latino communities. If successful, it would be one of the largest commercial real-estate funds ever to focus on minority neighborhoods.<br />Martin Muoto, chief executive of the real-estate firm SoLa Impact LLC, already runs three funds totaling $180 million. They focus on affordable housing and some commercial real estate in minority neighborhoods around South Los Angeles. The funds, which raised money from large investors like the private-equity firm General Atlantic, have recorded double-digit average annual returns since the first fund launched in 2014.<br />Now, Mr. Muoto is trying to use a similar approach in cities across the U.S. that suffer from a shortage of affordable housing and from what he said are regulatory barriers that make it tougher to build. His new Black Impact Fund is focusing on large metropolises like Philadelphia and Atlanta, as well as midsize cities like Fresno, Calif.<br />SoLa has been investing in opportunity zones, a program created by the 2017 federal tax overhaul that allows investors to defer and reduce taxes if they reinvest capital gains in designated low-income communities.<br />Critics of the program say it sometimes misses the mark, like when states earmark neighborhoods where development is already taking place. That could give investors a significant tax break without creating many new jobs or more affordable housing in poorer neighborhoods.</td>
