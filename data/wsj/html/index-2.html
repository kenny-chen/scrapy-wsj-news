      <td>China’s top diplomat warned the U.S. not to cross a “red line,” in an attempt to steer a delicate bilateral relationship toward areas of cooperation as President Biden signals continuity with the previous administration on hot-button issues including Hong Kong and Xinjiang.<br />Yang Jiechi on Tuesday Beijing time emphasized the potential for a healthy U.S.-China relationship on public health, trade and climate, echoing recent language from leader Xi Jinping. But he left limited room for negotiation on issues such as human rights, the coronavirus response and what he called U.S. interference in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang.<br />“These issues concern China’s core interests, national dignity, as well as the sensitivities of its 1.4 billion people,” Mr. Yang said in a video address to the National Committee on United States-China Relations in New York. “They constitute a red line which must not be crossed.”<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken had in an interview that aired hours earlier on MSNBC criticized China for having broken its promises on Hong Kong’s autonomy and handling of the Covid-19 outbreak with a lack of transparency.<br />Mr. Blinken—whose message deviated little from that of his predecessor, Mike Pompeo—described China as a significant challenge to the U.S. but said strong alliances are an advantage for Washington in confronting China.</td>

      <td>The former president plans to argue the process is unconstitutional because he is out of office</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Donald Trump and House impeachment managers will give the Senate details of their respective strategies Tuesday ahead of the trial on a charge that the former president incited a riot at the U.S. Capitol, with Mr. Trump’s team planning to argue that the entire exercise is unconstitutional.<br />Mr. Trump had until noon to respond to a summons, while the House Democrats prosecuting the case had until 10 a.m. to submit a trial brief. Under the rough rules sketched out for the trial, the parties are charged with answering two main questions: whether Mr. Trump can be tried in the Senate for acts committed when he was president, and how they respond to the charge of “incitement of insurrection.”<br />Forty-five of the Senate’s 50 Republicans last week sided on a procedural vote with the argument that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional because Mr. Trump is now a private citizen, and Mr. Trump’s legal team plans to emphasize that point. The key premise of Tuesday’s filing will be the argument that convicting Mr. Trump would be unconstitutional, adviser Jason Miller said. The defense team also plans to argue that the impeachment proceedings were conducted inappropriately, pointing to the fact that Democrats introduced no witnesses or evidence and didn’t allow Mr. Trump to have a lawyer present.<br />“He’s basically being impeached based on speeches made by politicians in Congress,” Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, said in an interview. Mr. Giuliani isn’t serving on the former president’s defense team.<br />House Democrats have been busy honing arguments that the trial is constitutional. “The whole argument defies common sense,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the lead impeachment manager, said in an interview last month. “It seems to say that if a president decides to commit the most atrocious act of trying to foment a violent insurrection or stage a coup against the country, but does it in the last couple weeks in office, that president cannot be impeached and tried in the Senate for doing it.”</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—Russia’s homegrown Sputnik V vaccine showed high levels of efficacy and safety in a peer-reviewed study released Tuesday, a potential boost for the Kremlin’s aim to promote the Covid-19 shot abroad and curb the pandemic at home.<br />The findings, from a preliminary analysis of a large-scale clinical trial published in the British medical journal the Lancet, demonstrated that the two-shot vaccine was 91.6% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 and offered complete protection against severe cases. There were no serious side effects, the paper said. The vaccine was also found to be similarly safe and effective in elderly people.<br />The study could be a significant milestone for Moscow in the global vaccination race, potentially offering President Vladimir Putin’s government geopolitical clout in the developing world and the chance to tap into the lucrative global vaccine market. Russia—the world’s fourth worst-hit country with nearly four million cases—has also banked on Sputnik V to avoid new costly lockdowns as authorities plan to vaccinate 60% of the domestic population by the end of the year.<br />The shot, which was approved by Russian authorities in August before undergoing large-scale clinical trials, has stirred questions in light of its fast-tracked development and lack of published trial data. So far, Sputnik V has been administered to more than two million people world-wide, including in Argentina, Serbia and Algeria, according to Russian authorities.<br />Tuesday’s results could help clear doubts surrounding the Russian shot.</td>

      <td>For oil  supermajor BP ,  one big obstacle stands out on the road to a greener future: its almost 20% stake in Russia’s top oil producer.<br />On Tuesday, the British company reported disappointing 2020 results, hit by lower prices, depressed demand and asset write-offs. The shares fell in early trading, having significantly underperformed peers since Chief Executive Bernard Looney announced a new strategy in September. The plan to move away from fossil fuels and into clean energy and convenience retailing has been sufficient to scare off some traditional investors, but not radical enough to attract green-minded ones.<br />The investment in Rosneft is a problem. The Russian state-backed company has a plan to develop the fragile Arctic region with 6,500 wells and 5,500 km of pipelines, as well as airports, ports, towns and highways, all working to produce and distribute 1 million tons of oil a year. The so-called Vostok project is kryptonite for the environmental investors BP is hoping to attract.<br />The company wants to sell $25 billion in assets by 2025 to pay down debt, but not the Rosneft stake. That is despite BP’s lack of control: It has two board seats and some influence, but Moscow is definitely in charge.<br />Mr. Looney said Tuesday that the Rosneft stake fits well with the new strategy. The Russian company’s production costs are about half of BP’s, and it plans to decrease its greenhouse-gas intensity. The stake is a “good financial investment,” he said, having contributed $4 billion in dividends to BP since 2013.</td>

Facebook first removed the Myawaddy television network from its platform in 2018 as part of a crackdown on hundreds of pages, groups and accounts—some tied to Myanmar’s military—that it said had abused its services, but a page promoting the station later reappeared.<br />After The Wall Street Journal asked Monday why the Myawaddy page was operational given its earlier ban, Facebook removed it and it now displays a message saying “This Page Isn’t Available.”<br />A spokesman for the military didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the page’s removal. A separate Facebook page for announcements from the military wasn’t banned in 2018 and remains operational.<br />The head of Myanmar’s military, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, took charge of the country Monday from its civilian-run government after the military detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of her party in a Monday morning raid.</td>

      <td>The eurozone’s economy is diverging sharply from the U.S. and China, as stubbornly high coronavirus infections, extensive Covid-19 restrictions and a painfully slow vaccine rollout delay Europe’s recovery from last year’s historic economic downturn.<br />Fresh data Tuesday highlighted an economic gap between the eurozone and the U.S. and China that is likely to widen this year, given that the U.S. is proceeding more quickly than the European Union in rolling out vaccines and China remains largely free of the virus.<br />The eurozone’s gross domestic product contracted by 0.7% in the three months through December from the previous quarter, resulting in an annual decline of 6.8% for the bloc in 2020, the EU’s statistics agency said on Tuesday. That compares with a 3.5% decline for the U.S. economy last year, supported by a strong rebound in the fourth quarter. China’s economy grew by around 2.3% last year.<br />Since the start of the pandemic, European policy makers have sought to balance saving lives and supporting businesses, but have generally pursued more draconian restrictions to stop the virus’s spread than has the U.S. Nonetheless, the death toll in Europe is approaching that of U.S., while its economic performance—already lagging behind the U.S. before the pandemic—has been much worse than other advanced economies.<br />Now, a sluggish rollout of vaccines, the threat of highly contagious new variants of the virus and the possibility of weeks or months of continued restrictions bode ill for the near term and could delay a recovery. EU countries have administered vaccines to less than 3% of their populations compared with 9% in the U.S. and 14% in the U.K., according to OurWorldInData.</td>

      <td>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  said an extended shopping event in November helped boost its profit and sales for the last three months of 2020, a period that also saw the technology giant and its founder attracting scrutiny from Chinese regulators.<br />The Chinese e-commerce giant’s annual 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, normally a one-day affair, ran from Nov. 1 to Nov. 11. That generated 498.2 billion yuan, equivalent to $74.1 billion, in gross merchandise value during those 11 days, excluding unpaid orders, up 26% from the same time frame in 2019, the company said Tuesday.<br />Sales for the fiscal third quarter rose about 37% to 221.08 billion yuan, ahead of the 214.29 billion yuan analysts polled by FactSet had expected.<br />The company’s cloud-computing revenue grew 50% to 16.12 billion yuan, a gain the company attributed to customers in the internet, retail and public sectors. Alibaba said it processed 583,000 orders per second during the 11.11 event.<br />The company’s results come after the suspension of a blockbuster initial public offering of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group Co. in November, a sudden halt to what would have been the world’s largest IPO. The move delivered an extraordinary rebuke to Jack Ma, the billionaire co-founder of both Alibaba and Ant who drew the ire of Chinese regulators when he gave a speech at a financial forum in Shanghai in October. Chinese authorities have launched a probe into Alibaba for alleged anticompetitive behavior on its e-commerce platform.</td>

      <td>Wood-pulp prices are soaring thanks to speculators in China, with help from paper takeout containers, a weaker dollar and people using restrooms at home instead of the office.<br />Bleached softwood kraft pulp futures have risen 48% on the Shanghai Futures Exchange since Dec. 1, to about $1,037 a ton. Meanwhile, producers around the world are boosting prices for the wood mash at unusually sharp rates.  Domtar Corp. , based in South Carolina, said it would raise prices this month between $100 and $130 a ton, depending on grade.<br />“Spot prices are really jumping,” said Brian McClay, a pulp-market consultant and a founder of pricing service Trade Tree Online. “I’ve been in the pulp business since 1978 and have been asking friends: No one has seen this before, no one has seen the scale of this.”<br />Prices are hottest for softwood pulp, the type that comes from coniferous trees and is used to make products such as premium toilet tissue, paper towels, junk mail and coffee cups. It is made from sawmill scraps as well as from trees too skinny, knotty or crooked to be cut into lumber.<br />China buys more than one-third of the world’s pulp and churns out paper products and packaging. Shanghai pulp futures, which began trading in 2018, serve as a price guide for an array of varieties and grades, similar to the way that West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude futures are reference points for oil prices.</td>

The project is part of Amazon’s more than $2.5 billion, 25,000-employee office campus, which the Seattle-based company calls its second headquarters.<br />While numerous tech firms have pledged to allow employees to work from home even after the coronavirus pandemic is contained, Amazon,  Facebook Inc.,   Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and others have continued to expand their urban office footprints.

The agency said the problem affected roughly 158,000 vehicles, including Model S sedans built between 2012 and early 2018 and Model X vehicles made from 2016 through early 2018.<br />The reason for the discrepancy between the NHTSA’s figure and the number of vehicles Tesla plans to recall wasn’t immediately clear.<br />Tesla said in a letter to federal regulators made public Tuesday that while it disagreed that the issue constituted a defect in the vehicles, it was going ahead with a recall to conclude the investigation and provide a better experience for customers.<br />“It is economically, if not technologically, infeasible to expect that such components can or should be designed to last the vehicle’s entire useful life,” Tesla said in the letter.</td>

The Atlanta-based company has tried to offset the costs with new delivery surcharges throughout the year and by negotiating higher rates with other customers.<br />For the fourth quarter, UPS posted a slight increase in overall operating margins to 11.5% on an adjusted basis, although margins dipped slightly in its main U.S. package segment.</td>

      <td>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny faces a court hearing Tuesday in which prosecutors have requested that a suspended sentence he received in 2014 be turned into real prison time. Russian authorities say Mr. Navalny repeatedly violated the terms of his parole, including when he was recuperating in Germany after he was poisoned.<br />Prosecutors made their request when Mr. Navalny was abroad. The opposition leader says it was meant to deter him from returning to Russia, where he had promised to resume his campaign against President Vladimir Putin.<br />Alexei Navalny is Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, a fierce anticorruption activist who has managed to galvanize Russia’s political opposition by exposing flaws in the more than 20-year rule of Mr. Putin.<br />Mr. Navalny first dove into politics as part of a broader ethnic Russian nationalist movement. But in 2012, he pivoted to become part of a wider coalition of opposition groups that sought to lead protests against Mr. Putin’s decision to return as president after serving for four years as prime minister.<br />Mr. Navalny is a skilled speaker who rouses crowds with ease, but his real weapon is his YouTube channel that gives him a nationwide platform to reach nearly 4 million subscribers and urge them to protest in the streets of Moscow and other big cities.</td>

      <td>India’s aggressive new fiscal plan will be a boon to its post-Covid recovery. But there is still no coherent longer-term plan for lifting the country into the upper-middle-income club.<br />First, the good news. The finance ministry has opted to generously lubricate the stuttering economy, setting a deficit target for the coming financial year significantly higher than expected, at 6.8% of gross domestic product. That means a plan to cut the deficit to 3% of GDP within five years has been effectively abandoned.<br />The expanded deficit isn’t just down to lower tax revenue, but higher spending on infrastructure, health and education. India suffered one of the world’s sharpest downturns during the pandemic, with second-quarter GDP down 23% from a year earlier. For now, the benefits of a supportive fiscal policy far outweigh the drawbacks.<br />What is less promising is what the budget suggests about the government’s overall strategy to lift incomes over the longer term, especially in the context of other recent policy decisions.<br />India now sits conspicuously outside both large Asian trade blocs: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the more recent Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. It is not the obvious choice for any manufacturer looking to expand operations outside of East Asia but within a unified supply chain.</td>

SPAC stands for special-purpose acquisition company, a vehicle for swiftly taking entities public.<br />Alameda-based Astra, which has about 120 employees, late last year blasted a rocket to the edge of space from a launchpad in Kodiak, Alaska. The booster failed to reach orbit velocity during that demonstration flight in December. Company founder and Chief Executive Chris Kemp, a former high-ranking NASA official, said he expects another test soon, followed by an initial commercial mission as early as summer.<br />In going public, Astra seeks to stand out from a bevy of small-rocket competitors by locking in funding despite fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and an anticipated shakeout of rivals targeting the same market segment.<br />The company says it is able to lift satellites weighing about 100 pounds into low-earth orbit, but gradually hopes to increase that capacity about fivefold. Astra’s move comes amid a boom in the use of relatively compact satellites for internet access, earth imaging, military applications and other purposes.</td>

      <td>LONDON— BP  PLC returned to profit in the fourth quarter but said the pandemic, which battered the oil-and-gas industry in 2020, would continue to challenge its business this year.<br />Covid-19 has sapped demand for oil, hitting prices, and prompted the world’s biggest energy companies to slash spending, cut jobs, write down the value of their assets and—in the case of BP and  Royal Dutch Shell  PLC—lower dividends. The crisis led U.S. oil giants  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Chevron Corp.  to discuss a merger, according to people familiar with the matter, although the talks didn’t progress.<br />BP said Tuesday its earnings had suffered from weaker gas marketing and trading results, while refining margins and utilization remained under pressure. However, this was partly offset by income from asset sales, including some proceeds from the $5 billion sale of its petrochemicals business to Ineos Ltd.<br />The company reported a replacement cost profit—a metric similar to the net income figure that U.S. oil companies report—of $825 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, from a loss of $4 million in the year-earlier period. For the full year, it reported a loss of $18.1 billion, from a profit of $3.5 billion in 2019.<br />BP said Covid-19 restrictions would continue to sap demand early in 2021 and that the pandemic may have an enduring impact on the global economy, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period.</td>

Instead, the actions signal a desire to balance competing pressures: immigration advocates hoping for swift action to undo former President Donald Trump’s policies and the danger that undoing too many restrictions at once could trigger a surge of migrants attempting to enter the U.S.<br />The reunification task force, which Mr. Biden pledged to create during his campaign, will charge the government with identifying all of the children who remain separated from their parents and locating those parents across Latin America, where they were likely deported.<br />The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the separated children in a continuing class-action lawsuit against the U.S. government, and other nonprofit organizations have been placing advertisements and making trips across the region to help locate deported parents.

      <td>So much for the “rigged” market, the supposed conspiracy to fleece Reddit traders, and other nonsense spouted about last week’s stock market ructions involving  GameStop  and other companies. It turns out the controversy was essentially about a larger than normal clearinghouse call for capital.<br />As David Battan explains nearby, that’s almost certainly the story behind the decision by Robinhood, the internet trading app, to limit trades in certain stocks for a time late last week. Politicians like Sen. Ted Cruz and bar-stool financial analysts claimed to see a plot by the new Robber Barons.<br />The reality is more prosaic. Robinhood and other brokers were deluged by traders looking to invest in GameStop and other shares, often with options contracts that can increase leverage and trading risk. A clearinghouse that processes and settles trades watched the volatile trading and demanded more collateral to cope with potential losses.<br />Robinhood Chief Executive Vlad Tenev explained the demand Sunday night in an interview on a livestream on Clubhouse, a social-networking app. “The request was around $3 billion, which is, you know, about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is,” Mr. Tenev said.<br />A margin call is not a conspiracy. A clearinghouse is an intermediary between buyers and sellers in a financial market. It “clears,” or finalizes, trades and makes sure the parties fulfill the contract and assets are delivered. It also mitigates risk by requiring that trades be backed by enough capital to reduce the chances that one of the trading parties goes bankrupt. This protects investors as well as brokers.</td>

She had entered the building as part of a crowd aiming to disrupt the certification of President Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.<br />The officer who shot her had been placed on leave soon after the riot while Ms. Babbitt’s death was being investigated, including on the question of whether it was a violation of her civil rights.<br />The Justice Department said in announcing the investigation that it was following routine procedure for whenever a police officer uses deadly force by having the Washington Metropolitan Police Department examine the shooting. The police investigators have made an initial determination that charges against the officer aren’t warranted, the people said, adding that Justice Department officials haven’t yet made a final determination on the matter. The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington is leading the broader investigation into the riot and prosecuting the more than 150 cases that have resulted to date.<br />A Justice Department spokeswoman had no immediate comment.

      <td>From protests in Moscow to Chinese air incursions over Taiwan, the world is wasting no time testing Joe Biden’s foreign policy team of liberal internationalists. On Monday Americans woke up to news of a swift and (so far) bloodless coup in Burma, whose transition to democratic government was touted by the Obama Administration as one of its major achievements.<br />Now the country’s generals are moving to reassert control after their party was walloped in November elections. Aung San Suu Kyi, the top elected leader of Burma (also called Myanmar), wanted to use her mandate to change the constitution to limit the generals’ power. That looks like the trigger for the military’s forced suspension of civilian government and communications blackout.<br />The Biden Administration is rightly denouncing the move, but the U.S. has limited leverage acting alone. The West has used market access as a carrot to urge Burma’s military rulers to cede power to Ms. Suu Kyi. Yet the extent that a power transition actually occurred was exaggerated. A return to economically isolating the country of 54 million on China’s southern border could hurt the Burmese people and play into Beijing’s hands.<br />As our Walter Russell Meadwrote in 2019, “Western fecklessness has made China look to Myanmar like a more stable and reliable partner.” President Trump’s great-power diplomacy was sometimes crudely transactional. Yet the Biden team might be tempted to pivot too far in the opposite direction, stressing liberal values at the expense of core American interests.<br />The top U.S. priority in Asia is limiting Beijing’s ability to control independent states like Burma, which is strategically situated in the Indo-Pacific. China is holding back from condemning the coup, likely in hopes of making diplomatic inroads with a military government.</td>

Mr. Blinken said Russians are fed up with “corruption” and “autocracy” and added that Mr. Biden delivered a similar message in a phone call with Mr. Putin.<br />Good to hear, but the Administration sent a very different signal by embracing an unconditional five-year extension of the New Start nuclear arms treaty, which Mr. Putin made formal on Friday. The accord is a classic 20th century arms-control treaty that was inadequate when it came into force a decade ago.<br />New Start limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and bombs at 1,550. It also caps the deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles and nuclear-equipped heavy bombers. The deal would have expired Feb. 5, but Mr. Biden took the longest extension possible.<br />This squanders useful diplomatic work by the Trump Administration. While Washington withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) and Open Skies treaties, which Russia was violating, it tried to negotiate a shorter extension to New Start last year.</td>

      <td>Europe wants to lure Yellen into a revenue raid on U.S. tech giants.</td>
      <td>Most world leaders hope the new Biden Administration augurs a more, how shall we say, “cooperative spirit” when it comes to allies. An early test, concerning tax policy, highlights how disappointed some may be.<br />The Biden team takes power as other governments are launching a push to grab more revenue from American tech companies. Fiscal jealousy has been rife for years as large U.S. companies such as Google,  Facebook  and  Apple  earned billions of dollars in high-tax-rate jurisdictions while existing tax rules allowed them to book the profits and pay tax in lower-rate countries.<br />This phenomenon provoked varied responses. The stick is an array of digital services taxes imposed by France, Spain and the U.K. targeting revenue—not profits—of the U.S. tech companies. The carrot is a negotiation led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development supposedly to provide tech companies legal certainty by revamping the rules governing taxation of global companies.<br />The Trump Administration cooled on that effort and threatened tariffs against governments imposing discriminatory taxes on U.S. tech firms. Foreign officials hope President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will be more amenable, and Ms. Yellen’s confirmation hearing was marked by promises to work with the OECD.<br />Look closer, however, and problems appear. One proposal would upend decades-old global rules that tax a company where it is headquartered rather than where it does business. The OECD and some governments want to base taxation on where revenue is earned. The OECD also wants a global minimum tax. Each country would commit to taxing at least 12.5% of the profits of companies headquartered there—primarily to make sure the company isn’t paying “too little” via legal planning.</td>

      <td>His ‘Buy American’ plan is worse than Trump’s for suppliers.</td>
      <td>President Biden doubled down on Donald Trump’s “Buy American” campaign, signing a Jan. 25 executive order that would not only maintain Mr. Trump’s destructive protectionism, but increase the burdens on international trade.<br />Mr. Biden’s new order will keep Mr. Trump’s mandate that the federal government buy goods made domestically. But it adds a new, highly disruptive mandate to raise the threshold for foreign components going into those finished goods, along with the establishment of a panel to reduce the many exemptions the Trump administration had made.<br />Despite its antitrade image, the Trump administration hadn’t even finalized its own “Buy American” rules until two days before leaving office, suggesting a gap between rhetoric and economic reality that the new administration seeks to close.<br />In the wake of Mr. Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, this was a second body blow to Canadian workers. This is because components are key to Canada’s exports to the U.S., which make up around 80% of all of Canada’s exports. Considering that Canada’s two largest exports are natural resources and automotive components, together accounting for nearly two-thirds of Canada’s total exports, the new president seems to be going for his neighbor’s jugular.<br />North American supply chains integrate industries on both sides of the border, especially in the automotive sector. U.S. scrap steel, for instance, is exported to Ontario, where U.S. manufacturers such as Ford and  General Motors  use it to produce vehicles for export back to the U.S. Mandates on where components are made risk shutting countries out of existing supply chains.</td>

      <td>The successful vaccine program followed the model of U.S. mobilization in World War II.</td>
      <td>Every day new questions and criticisms arise about Operation Warp Speed, the public-private vaccine development initiative launched by presidential order in May 2020. Most of that criticism focuses on the distribution bottlenecks that have developed in different states, as Americans are impatient with the slow pace of the rollout. Jen Psaki, President Biden’s press secretary, has claimed to see an “urgent need to address failures of the Trump team approach to vaccine distribution.” Some in the new administration even want to rename the program.<br />Nearly all these claims rest on a misunderstanding both of Operation Warp Speed’s mission and its nature as a government program. While President Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and others dubbed the original project MP2, or Manhattan Project 2, after the crash effort to build an atomic bomb, Operation Warp Speed’s leadership borrowed a more practical model: the industrial mobilization during World War II that produced the so-called Arsenal of Democracy.<br />That model can still push the vaccine rollout over the finish line. Governors and other state officials in particular need to realize the federal government is operating in the wake of a health-care version of Pearl Harbor, and adjust their operations accordingly.<br />From the beginning the principal mission of Operation Warp Speed was the development, manufacturing, and distribution—i.e., shipping—of coronavirus vaccines. To date, the program has managed to produce and deliver about 50 million vaccine doses—all made in the U.S.—with hundreds of millions more on the way. It also had 97,000 certified receivers distributing the vaccine across the U.S.<br />It is the most remarkable achievement in modern medicine, made possible by following the model of the World War II mobilization effort. That model rests on three principles.</td>

      <td>Team Biden will be disappointed if it mistakes them for starry-eyed idealists.</td>
      <td>Sooner or later every new presidential administration experiences that sinking feeling that one of its big ideas may not be working well. For Team Biden, that moment arrived last week as Germany, with widespread support in the European Union, made clear that Europe has no real interest in countering either Russia or China.<br />Warning against the “building of blocs,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told her virtual audience at the World Economic Forum that she thought Europe should not join with either the U.S. or China against the other. Coming on top of an earlier European refusal to defer moving on an EU-China investment accord until the incoming Biden administration could weigh in on the matter, Europe has made its views crystal clear. Uighurs, Hong Kong and the growing military threats in and around the South China Sea matter much less to European policy makers than their commercial interests do.<br />Alexei Navalny’s challenge to President Vladimir Putin has likewise prompted a European response that is less than robust. As democracy activists and human-rights organizations on both sides of the Atlantic sought to pressure Western governments to do something about Mr. Navalny’s detention and the arrests across Russia, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs announced that he was pressing ahead with a previously planned visit to Moscow for meetings with Mr. Putin. Light wrist slaps may follow, but little more.<br />For starry-eyed American liberals—in whose rich fantasies Europe’s chancelleries are inhabited by committed idealists—this may come as a shock. Europeans aren’t from Mars, and some may hail from Venus, as Robert Kagan put it in his 2004 essay “Of Paradise and Power.” But those who rule the Continent come mostly from Pluto, a cold and remote planet named for the ancient god of the underworld—and of wealth.<br />It’s a mistake to see Europeans as idealists merely because they like multilateralism and discount the importance of military power. Multilateralism is a realist program for Europe, not an idealist one. Even the largest European states know that they are too small to figure as great powers on their own; they must work together if they want to sway Washington and Beijing. As Mr. Kagan noted, they also understand that a rules-based international order grounded in multilateral institutions increases European world influence.</td>

      <td>Will Joe Biden speak up for those he credits with making him the man he is today?</td>
      <td>Amid all the pain and disruption, a year of coronavirus has given Americans a new respect for those working to keep daily life as normal as possible, from the frontline nurse to the Amazon delivery man. Near the top of this honor roll is an especially unsung hero: the Catholic-school teacher.<br />The National Catholic Education Association reports that its schools boast a total enrollment of 1,626,291. In ordinary times their teachers do an extraordinary job, especially for their poor and minority students. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor once said, “Catholic schools have been a pipeline to opportunity” for people like her—poor, Latina, raised by a single mom. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, Catholic-school administrators have moved heaven and earth to keep their classrooms open to new generations of Sotomayors.<br />“The science is clear that there is no substitute for in-person learning, especially for poor and minority children most at danger of falling behind,” says Tom Carroll, superintendent of Catholic schools for the Archdiocese of Boston. “Across the nation, the Catholic school approach is to stay open wherever we are allowed.”<br />It’s been a roller coaster. During the first days of the lockdowns, many Catholic schools closed forever because of a cash crunch. Kathy Mears, the NCEA’s interim president and CEO, reckons that Covid forced the closure of 107 Catholic schools, though an exact number is difficult because in many cases other factors were also involved.<br />But a funny thing happened after the shutdowns. Once moms and dads realized that the Catholic schools left standing were staying open through the pandemic, they began moving children out of public school. It’s not been enough to stave off the 6.4% drop in national enrollment the Catholic schools have seen since Covid-19 hit, but it does highlight that these schools are among the few real alternatives parents have today.</td>

      <td>A ‘reign’s length’ of social change in Britain, from the ascension of Elizabeth II to the Beatles, Brussels, Brexit and beyond.</td>
      <td>In one of many audacious assertions in a book that tells the story of Britain from 1952 to the present day, Andrew Marr writes that if Shakespeare was “the hot-glowing cultural figure of the first Elizabethan age, then the Beatles—John, Paul, George and Ringo—performed a parallel role in the second.” The second age is, of course, that of Elizabeth II, whose 69-year reign is the longest of any British monarch, exceeding by more than two decades (and counting) her Tudor namesake’s time on the throne.<br />Mr. Marr, a journalist of stature in Britain—where he is a TV and radio host on the BBC and a former editor of the Independent—calls his book “Elizabethans.” He spurns the definite article in his title, perhaps to make it more easily distinguished from “The Elizabethans” (2011), by A.N. Wilson, with its focus on the late 16th century. And yet, as you read Mr. Marr’s rich and ebullient account of “how modern Britain was forged,” you learn that it makes no sense, in our own time, to speak of an Elizabethan type or national character in the way we do (however superficially) of “the Victorians.” The Britons of today are notably—and sometimes jarringly—different from those of 1952, when a callow Elizabeth II, then 25, acceded to the throne upon the death of her father.<br />The packaging of Britain’s story into a “reign’s length” is attractive nonetheless, because it acknowledges that Queen Elizabeth has been the one truly constant factor in a nation that has been an outlier among major Western powers: Britain has attached and detached itself to and from Europe as it has pleased—while enjoying more enduring links on the wider map than even the United States. Contemporary Britain, writes Mr. Marr, is also “unusual in European terms in its porousness to migration from non-European parts of the world.” All of which make it an attractive national laboratory in which to measure social-political change over generations.<br />Mr. Marr has written an ambitious book in which he accords more attention to subtle social shifts than he does to “the big, visible changes”—things such as the disappearance of bowler hats, the emptying of churches and the springing up of mosques, of which we know already. What fewer of us know, by contrast, are the nuances and shades of change. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, notes Mr. Marr, “the British seem to become cheekier, even rebellious,” and “an insolent contempt for established authority begins to creep in.” The Beatles—whose language, he concedes, was more “banal” than the Bard’s—were part of that rebellion.<br />This shift in mood, though seemingly a spasm of youthful high spirits, would prove to be a herald of broader changes. The 1960s, Mr. Marr tells us, were a period of “generational conflict.” But for most working-class Britons, they were also “a period of greater material wealth.” The Britain of the previous decade, he reminds us, was “a quietly religious, homogeneous, stratified, socially conservative, proud and comparatively closed-off country.” The insular working classes, as he puts it, “had never been to Spain.” Over time, the country acquired the means to travel and eat better food.</td>

Lower courts found the Trump administration exceeded its authority, but the Supreme Court’s conservative majority allowed the reallocations to continue and construction to proceed while appeals were pending.<br />In the asylum case, Ms. Prelogar cited a Jan. 20 directive from the acting secretary of homeland security, David Pekoske, suspending new enrollment in the asylum program, which formally is called the Migrant Protection Protocols.</td>

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.)  from her committee assignments if Republicans don’t take action, according to people familiar with the plans.<br />The move increases pressure on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) at a time when he is caught in the party’s political cross-currents after former President Donald Trump’s loss. Stripping a lawmaker of committee assignments takes away an important venue to shape legislation and participate in panel debates, diminishing his or her influence.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said he has spoken to Mr. McCarthy, who has said he plans to meet with Mrs. Greene this week, likely on Tuesday. Mrs. Greene “must be held accountable for her reprehensible statements, and I am discussing with members the best course of action to do so,” Mr. Hoyer said Monday.<br />Mr. McCarthy didn’t respond to a request for comment on the Democrats’ push. If Mr. McCarthy doesn’t strip Mrs. Greene from her assignments on the budget and education committees, Democrats plan to bring up a measure to the Rules Committee on Wednesday afternoon, setting up a floor vote to remove her. The Rules Committee on Monday afternoon posted the resolution, scheduling it for a Wednesday meeting.<br />“It is my hope and expectation that Republicans will do the right thing and hold Rep. Greene accountable, and we will not need to consider this resolution. But we are prepared to do so if necessary,” Mr. Hoyer said.</td>

      <td>Exxon Mobil Corp.  is forming a business unit that will focus exclusively on technologies to lower carbon emissions, as the oil giant faces increasing pressure to step up its sustainability investments.<br />Exxon said Monday that the new business, dubbed “low carbon solutions,” would invest $3 billion through 2025 on lower emission energy technologies, primarily on carbon capture and storage projects, which gather carbon emissions from industrial processes or directly from the air and deposit them underground. Those investments would represent roughly 3% to 4% of Exxon’s planned annual capital expenditures.<br />Exxon has a large research-and-development division that has invested in carbon capture for years, and Exxon says it has captured more carbon than any other company. Currently, the only large-scale use for captured carbon is to help produce more fossil fuels by pumping in the gas to squeeze more oil and gas out of the ground.<br />“With our demonstrated leadership in carbon capture and emissions reduction technologies, Exxon Mobil is committed to meeting the demand for affordable energy while reducing emissions,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said.<br />Exxon is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday after previously disclosing that it would write down as much as $20 billion in assets. It endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020 and has already posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.</td>

      <td>GOP plan includes $300 a week in federal unemployment benefits through June</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A group of 10 Senate Republicans released new details of their roughly $618 billion coronavirus-relief counteroffer Monday, including a round of $1,000 direct checks for many adults, as Democrats began the process for passing President Biden’s $1.9 trillion plan along party lines.<br />The Republicans are meeting with Mr. Biden Monday evening to discuss their proposal, which would provide $300 a week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through June, include $20 billion each for child care and schools, $50 billion for small-business relief and $160 billion for vaccines, testing and protective equipment, according to a summary of the proposal’s spending released Monday morning.<br />The White House agreed to the meeting on Sunday after the Republicans requested it. On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the meeting between Mr. Biden and the Republicans “is not a forum for the president to make or accept an offer.” She added: “It is important to him that he hears this group out on their concerns, on their ideas.”<br />Pared down from Mr. Biden’s original plan, the proposal from the 10 Republicans omits measures favored by many Democrats, such as aid for state and local governments and raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Republicans said their plan was an opportunity for the Biden administration to follow through on its calls for bipartisanship.<br />“Mr. President, we recognize your calls for unity and want to work in good faith with your administration to meet the health, economic, and societal challenges of the Covid crisis,” the group of senators led by Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) said Monday.</td>

      <td>Iran tested a new rocket on Monday with improved technology that could be used in its missile program, its latest attempt to raise the stakes for the Biden administration ahead of potential negotiations over a new nuclear deal.<br />The new rocket, named Zuljanah, was developed under a government-backed program to send civilian satellites into orbit 310 miles above ground, according to a spokesman for the Iranian Defense Ministry’s Space Department. The technology is easily transferable to Iran’s military missile program run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, experts say.<br />The Zuljanah features a solid-fuel-propelled motor that is the largest yet exhibited by Iran. Motors propelled by solid fuel, rather than liquid, are a key component in intercontinental ballistic missiles, which the U.S. seeks to prevent Iran from developing.<br />“After tests…[it] will be ready to put operational satellites in orbit,” said Ahmad Hosseini of the Defense Ministry, according to the IRNA state news agency.<br />While Iran regularly tests new missile technology, Monday’s launch, which was broadcast on national television, was the first since President Biden took office.</td>

Tom Wolf said Monday.<br />Proposed constitutional amendments must pass during consecutive legislative sessions, after which they are put to voters in a referendum. The Department of State is legally required to advertise the proposed amendment in newspaper ads. Lawmakers first passed the measure in question in 2019 and were on track to pass it a second time, when officials in Ms. Boockvar’s agency realized they hadn’t placed the required ads.<br />As a result, the multiyear process of amending the state Constitution must start all over again, unless the state Legislature were to pass a bill creating the two-year window for lawsuits, the governor’s office said.<br />“The delay caused by this human error will be heartbreaking for thousands of survivors of childhood sexual assault, advocates and legislators, and I join the Department of State in apologizing to you. I share your anger and frustration that this happened, and I stand with you in your fight for justice,” Mr. Wolf said in a statement.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden said the Myanmar military’s seizure of power was a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and that the U.S. would hold the leaders of Monday’s coup accountable.<br />The U.S. has limited leverage against the military leadership in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Broad economic sanctions such as those used by the George W. Bush and Obama administrations could alienate the country’s population and hurt public attitude toward the West, analysts say.<br />U.S. trade with Myanmar is small. Meanwhile, Beijing enjoys a multibillion-dollar trade and investment relationship with its neighbor and has expressed less public concern than the U.S. about who is in charge. That raises the possibility that any U.S. action could further drive Myanmar toward China, exacerbating tensions between Washington and Beijing as they compete for influence in the region.<br />U.S. options include broadening human-rights sanctions against leaders of the coup that are already in place over the country’s treatment of its Rohingya Muslim minority, and tracking and disclosing the military leaders’ international business dealings.<br />The United Nations Security Council is set to meet on Tuesday to discuss Myanmar in a closed session.</td>

      <td>Online investors who spurred a trading frenzy in the shares of  GameStop Corp.  and  AMC Entertainment Inc.  have moved onto a bigger target: the global silver market.<br />Futures prices for silver in New York on Monday settled at their highest level in eight years, the latest work by a loosely knit group of speculators who congregate on social-media platforms including Reddit’s WallStreetBets. Some participants have been contending aggressive buying could power GameStop-like, quadruple-digit percentage gains in other arenas, with some chatter over the weekend focusing on the roughly $50 billion physical market for silver.<br />Many traders with experience in commodities say the trade is highly speculative. There is more than enough silver to meet industrial demand for everything from semiconductors to solar panels, and producers can raise output to take advantage of higher prices. Previous efforts to corner the market have ultimately preceded crashes, most famously when the Hunt brothers artificially boosted silver in 1979 and 1980.<br />Still, the recent wave of speculation is unlike anything many in commodities have witnessed in the recently past. Shares of miners like  First Majestic Silver Corp.  and  Hecla Mining Co.  have been among the stock market’s best performers recently—each rose 20% or more on Monday—while the largest exchange-traded fund tied to silver logged its biggest-ever daily inflow on Friday. Online silver dealers around the country have even reported soaring demand from retail buyers.<br />“It’s become like the GameStop of commodities,” said Edward Meir, a consultant focused on metals at brokerage ED&F Man Capital Markets. “It doesn’t make any sense… It could be equally ugly on the way down.”</td>

      <td>Even people with asymptomatic Covid cases can have after-effects in their bodies, research indicates, raising questions about possible risks later in life.<br />An estimated one-quarter to one-third of Covid infections are asymptomatic, according to recent studies. Multiple studies have shown asymptomatic patients can have irregular lung scans. A couple of small studies have found cardiac issues in student athletes, including those with asymptomatic infections. And a study looking at asymptomatic and mild cases of Covid in children found signs of possible small blood vessel damage.<br />It’s not yet clear what health consequences any of these after-effects may have, if any, doctors say. Few other viruses have been scrutinized as closely as Covid-19, so it’s possible other viruses leave similar effects without causing major problems. In many cases the damage will likely resolve on its own, doctors note. But they say more research needs to be done to determine what, if anything, the long term effects might be, and whether people should seek monitoring or screening.<br />“There is a risk of internal hits to these people that they are unaware of,” says Eric J. Topol, founder and director of Scripps Research Translational Institute, a medical research facility in La Jolla, Calif. “When things happen slowly in a person, below the surface, you can end up with a chronic situation.”<br />Dr. Topol co-authored a study published online in January in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that estimated that at least one-third of Covid-19 positive individuals are asymptomatic. The estimate was based on a review of 61 studies with more than 1.8 million people.</td>

Growth is likely to average 2.6% a year through 2025, the CBO said. The agency said a roughly $900 billion relief bill enacted in December would add about 1.5% to the level of GDP this year and next.<br />The latest projections will be closely watched by lawmakers weighing how much additional government support the U.S. economy might need as it recovers from the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact.<br />Senate Republicans released new details of their roughly $618 billion coronavirus-relief proposal on Monday ahead of a meeting later in the day with President Biden.

      <td>THERE’S AT LEAST one upside to not being able to attend a raucous Super Bowl party this year: no competition for the snacks. Perhaps in years past you arrived late to the party and ended up with the only chair without a back, far from the snack table, where the dip disappeared from the bowl long before you could fight your way to it. This year you can tweak the recipe measurements to provide your household personal-size batches of party food, or keep the measurements the same and enjoy the leftovers throughout the week. Whether you want to spice it up with an award-winning wings recipe or satisfy a sweet tooth with raspberry miso cheesecake, these recipes will have you dancing in the end zone.<br />A good rule of thumb for finger foods: The messier it leaves your hands, the better it tastes. Case in point: chicken wings. If you’re up for outdoor grilling try this tangy version tossed with Alabama white sauce and seasoned with plenty of lemon juice. Refine your taco-assembly skills with chef Chris Wallace’s mushroom tacos, which can be whipped up sans meat or with bacon, depending on your preference. For something lighter and highly munchable, try these highly customizable popcorn recipes, with flavors ranging from Bloody Mary to spiced caramel.<br />There aren’t many times in a year when it’s completely acceptable—encouraged, in fact—to count dips as dinner, so why not take full advantage? This buttery oven-baked crab dip carries just the right amount of celery crunch. Serve it with crisp toast rounds—and a simple green salad, if you must. A classic French-onion dip is always a touchdown, and this luscious version topped with caramelized onions scores the extra point. And we strongly encourage you to give the unjustly maligned cheese ball another chance.<br />A good drink goes a long way when it comes to alleviating game-day stress. If you’re craving a bar-quality cocktail but don’t necessarily have a bar-quality setup, don’t worry: with some Tupperware and a tablespoon you can do wonders. Here’s our guide on how to MacGyver a pro-level drink at home. Or maybe you’d rather keep it simple, in which case this recipe for the world’s easiest Margarita will keep your at-home viewing party well lubricated with minimal distraction from the game.<br />No snackadium is complete without a hefty dose of sugar. (There are four quarters to get through, after all.) If you like a dash of salt with your sweets, singer Kelis’s chocolate chunk cookies with potato chips only take 30 minutes to prepare. Or indulge this nutty, caramel-y, brown-butter blondie that will make any dessert-lover question their brownie loyalty.</td>

At-home tests are expected to be less precise than those done in a lab and will likely require a follow-up test in certain situations.<br />Ellume shipped out its first batch of 10,000 tests to the U.S. the week of Jan. 18, the company said last week.

Now oil investors are experiencing their own déjà vu.<br />Exxon Mobil  and  Chevron ,  the two largest descendants of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly, discussed a potential merger last year, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. The companies’ shares barely moved Monday morning, perhaps reflecting skepticism that such a deal can happen.<br />As over-the-top as the idea sounds—it could be the largest corporate merger ever—it isn’t inconceivable. Today’s oil market conditions look similar to those that made oil megamergers possible starting in the late 1990s, when the Asian financial crisis led to a sudden collapse in global growth and oil demand. The resulting glut considerably weakened energy giants, leading to cost cuts and paving the way for big tie-ups. Both Covid-19 and Asia’s crisis knocked about a third off the average Brent price in 2020 and 1998, respectively.<br />That backdrop was what preceded Exxon’s merger with Mobil in 1999, number one and two in the U.S. at the time. Chevron’s 2001 nuptials with Texaco brought together what were then numbers two and three. Combined, Exxon and Chevron would satisfy about 4.3% of global oil demand—only a percentage point higher than the combined share of Exxon and Mobil a year after their merger.<br />It is unclear how close the deal is to materializing. Antitrust concerns aside, Chevron investors might be cautious about merging with Exxon as it faces scrutiny from securities regulators and activist investors.</td>

Israel has agreed to give a total of 5,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the Palestinians to inoculate front-line medical workers, they added.<br />The shipment was approved out of health concerns resulting from the mixing of Israeli and Palestinian populations, the officials said. A local committee of professional health advisers last week told the Israeli government that vaccinating the Palestinians is a “clear necessity” for Israel’s battle with the pandemic.<br />Israel two weeks ago had sent the Palestinian Authority 100 doses of a coronavirus vaccine for Palestinian health staff as a one-time humanitarian gesture, according to an Israeli security official.<br />Palestinian Authority officials couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.</td>

      <td>An HBO true-crime series dramatizes the search for answers in the 2017 murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall aboard a Danish entrepreneur’s submarine.</td>
      <td><br /><br />As thriller titles go, “The Investigation” is hardly “Chinatown” or “Vertigo” or “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark.” It rings perversely generic. But by episode 3 of this six-part fact-based fiction, one realizes what exactly “The Investigation” is not, which is “The Murder,” “The Suspect” or “The Trial.” The accused is not only never shown but never named. It’s the detective’s-eye view of a particularly heartbreaking crime, the police procedural extraordinaire—a case that tests its Scandinavian sleuths’ capacity for keeping their cool while finding a killer.<br />The real-life outrage on which it is based—the 2017 dismemberment murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, aboard a Danish entrepreneur’s small submarine in the waters off Copenhagen—made the news world-wide and was a tabloid sensation in Denmark. “The Submarine Case,” as it was called, stymied investigators because of a literal lack of corpus delicti and the fatuous but not-quite-refutable stories of the sub owner: Wall hit her head on the hatch and died. No, there was a vacuum lock on board and she was killed by carbon-monoxide fumes. He couldn’t get the body through the tower, so he cut it up. He buried her at sea because he wanted to spare her parents.<br />No one believed any of it, but as the prosecutor, Jakob Buch-Jepsen (Pilou Asbæk), tells the police—specifically head investigator Jens Møller Jensen (Søren Malling)—without a body they can’t prove a cause of death. Without a cause of death they can’t charge someone with murder.</td>

Her money paid for the lion’s share of the roughly $500,000 rally at the Ellipse where Mr. Trump spoke.<br />Another far-right activist and leader of the “Stop the Steal” movement, Ali Alexander, helped coordinate planning with Caroline Wren, a fundraising official who was paid by the Trump campaign for much of 2020 and who was tapped by Ms. Fancelli to organize and fund an event on her behalf, organizers said. On social media, Mr. Alexander had targeted Jan. 6 as a key date for supporters to gather in Washington to contest the 2020-election certification results. The week of the rally, he tweeted a flyer for the event saying: “DC becomes FORT TRUMP starting tomorrow on my orders!”<br />The Ellipse rally, at which President Trump urged supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol, was lawful and nonviolent. But it served as a jumping-off point for many supporters to head to the Capitol. Mr. Trump has been impeached by the Democrat-led House of Representatives, accused of inciting a mob to storm the Capitol with remarks urging supporters to “fight like hell.”</td>

Fertitta Entertainment Inc., a holding company for Golden Nugget casinos and Landry’s restaurants, will go public by combining with  Fast Acquisition Corp. , it said, citing opportunities in the post-pandemic hospitality and online-gambling sector.

They use the proceeds to make an acquisition, usually within a couple of years, that converts the target into a public company.<br />Fertitta Entertainment’s deal with Fast will include only the majority of assets and businesses that comprise Golden Nugget LLC and Landry’s LLC—together valued at about $6.6 billion, including about $3.2 billion in net debt—and roughly 31 million shares, or nearly half of the shares outstanding, in the online-casino platform  Golden Nugget Online Gaming Inc.

      <td>In our hyperpartisan, post-truth, fit-any-fact-to-your-narrative world, everything is a Rorschach test.<br />Trump partisans can behold an election result they don’t like and see nothing but fraud, conspiracy and theft. Democrats can look at two sets of riotous mobs and see treason and insurrection in one and peaceful protest and urgent cries for justice in the other. Teachers unions can observe data that show them at infinitesimal risk from a virus and see a mortal threat to their members’ health. Almost the entire media class can contemplate a New York governor who presides over what is still the nation’s highest death toll from Covid-19, made worse by his own administration’s arrogant diktats, and see a hero of unerring sagacity and competence.<br />So it is with the Great  GameStop  Insurrection of 2021.<br />To the censorious, it’s the latest terrifying threat in the age of mobocracy. The spectacle of individual investors, freely associating on a public social-media platform to turn the tables on a risky bet by hedge-fund managers, has been too much for the more sensitive Wall Street titans and their supporters to watch.<br />Some commentators compared the Reddit rebels to flash mobs looting a convenience store. A former SEC commissioner said the incident was reminiscent of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. Forcing an obscure hedge fund into the arms of an obscure creditor isn’t, I suppose, as thrilling as posing for selfies with Nancy Pelosi’s lectern, but it can be more financially rewarding and is less likely to result in a federal prison term.</td>

      <td>They were minimizing their own financial and regulatory risk, not trying to bail out hedge funds.</td>
      <td>Robinhood, E*Trade, Interactive Brokers and others restricted trading in  GameStop  and other names last week after GameStop surged to $483 intraday—a 10,000% increase since August for a historically brick-and-mortar company with declining revenues and a now-downloadable product. The brokers came in for swift, intense—and misguided—criticism.<br />As with everything else, social media took an extraordinarily complex situation—involving technical aspects of the financial markets, unclear legal standards, and public and private sector actors with valid but differing agendas—and produced a simple morality tale with the online brokers as the evil empire crushing plucky rebels like “u/-_Han-Yolo_-” to protect the hedge-fund Jabba the Hutts who shorted GameStop. Redditors showered Robinhood with vitriol and one-star reviews.<br />Political and social-media opportunists jumped in. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deemed GameStop trading restrictions “unacceptable” and demanded an investigation. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of the Financial Services Committee accused Robinhood of “stealing millions of dollars from their users.” Sen. Ted Cruz took to  Twitter  to “fully agree” with AOC: “Let the people trade.” Elon Musk “absolutely” agreed that Robinhood should be investigated, and called for short selling to be banned as “a scam.” Dave Portnoy, Barstool Sports founder and frozen-pizza reviewer, said to Robinhood executives: “You deserve to be behind bars.”<br />It must be unsettling when most of the internet wants your head in a basket, but Robinhood and the other brokers are in a no-win situation. Brokers are financially liable to the “clearinghouses” that clear and settle U.S. stocks and options, whether or not the clients can pay for their losing trades (so that those clearinghouses can pay the winners on the other side when the trade settles one or two days later).<br />When clients trade, especially on margin, they use the broker’s money to play. Imagine a client buys 100 shares of GameStop for $400 a share, using $20,000 of his own money and borrowing $20,000 from Robinhood. If the stock drops from $400 to $120 (as it did on Jan. 28), the client’s position may be sold for $12,000 due to the margin violation, leaving Robinhood trying to collect an unsecured $8,000 debt from “u/Thicc_Ladies_PM_Me.” Good luck. Multiply this by hundreds or thousands of similar clients. Option trading is worse because the leverage is much greater.</td>

The PAC’s only expenditures since the election have been a little more than $340,000 in fundraising costs.<br />The Save America funds will be key to Mr. Trump’s efforts to retain his grip on the Republican Party as he considers running for president again in 2024.<br />Mr. Trump could use the money to support his preferred candidates or back primary rivals to Republicans he is unhappy with.

Those states that ranked high in implicit age bias had a larger percentage of adults with poor health and higher per capita Medicare spending.<br />“When considering what it is like to grow old in the United States, where people live matters,” writes Hannah Giasson, a research fellow at Stanford University and lead author of the study, which was published in July in the European Journal of Social Psychology.<br /></td>

The screen will be paired with an Apple prompt related to its new privacy policy, which is expected to be released in the next several months. Facebook plans to test the screen with some users beginning Monday before officially launching it when Apple’s new privacy tool rolls out.<br />“People deserve the additional context, and Apple has said that providing education is allowed,” Facebook said Monday. The company said agreeing to the prompt wouldn’t result in its collecting new types of data, and users who decline it would still see advertisements, albeit less relevant. Apple’s prompt will ultimately be the decisive tool over how user behavior is tracked across apps.<br />Facebook and Apple have been battling for months on several fronts and have become more personal in their criticism lately.<br />Under Apple’s new privacy changes, which will be released in a new software update, many apps will begin asking users whether or not they want their behavior on the web to be tracked for the purposes of personalized ads. Facebook, which relies on such tracking to power its advertisement business, has said the new rules will hurt small businesses. The update has been controversial among the broader advertisement industry, although Apple has said the changes wouldn’t prohibit tracking but would require app makers to obtain users’ permission to do so.</td>

      <td>The response to the first-ever Wall Street Journal Fitness Challenge has been enthusiastic. Since its Jan. 19 launch, tens of thousands of readers have signed up for the six-week program. Haven’t signed up yet? You can join here.<br />A number of readers wrote in to ask if we could review the basics of the program. Here they are in a nutshell:<br />After signing up, you receive a welcome newsletter asking you to test in by seeing how many steps you can take up and down in 20 seconds, leading with your right foot and then your left foot. Up, up, down, down counts as one step. For an idea on what it should look like, check out this video.<br />Arnie Kander, the NBA sports performance coach who developed the workout, suggests using a step around 7 inches in height. One reader wrote in saying the stairs in her home are 8 inches high, too high for her knees. “Does this mean I have to invest in a step platform?” she asks.<br />Seven inches is what Mr. Kander suggests for a baseline height, but if that feels challenging, go lower. Anything that raises you off the ground and is stable will work, including a sidewalk curb or a low step stool. A lower height might skew your step count compared with other participants, but this program is about improving your movement patterns more than trying to beat other step counts.</td>

      <td>While some hedge funds have been hit hard, ‘Wall Street’ writ large could well profit from the GameStop saga</td>
      <td>There is a widely held view that the  GameStop  megarally has been bad news for Wall Street. But that depends on one’s definition of Wall Street.<br />Certainly last week was challenging for many in places like Greenwich, Conn., or Midtown Manhattan, where many hedge funds are set up. Funds betting against shares of GameStop and other heavily shorted companies have logged big losses. But many others employed in finance and trading may not have had such a bad week.<br />For example, JPMorgan Chase analysts said in a note last week that a daily index they track measuring performance of hedge funds that go long and short equities experienced a decline of about 2% over Tuesday and Wednesday, which the analysts noted wasn’t unusually large and suggested that “any heavy losses in this space would most likely be confined to a few hedge funds.”<br />Individual investors also aren’t alone in the ability to trade beyond fundamentals: Many quantitative funds trade on data signals and price movements. Justin Zhen, co-founder of Thinknum Alternative Data, said he started getting calls from quant firms last week seeking to generate sentiment measures from Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, where much of the discussion among individual investors surrounding shares like GameStop has originated. His data firm began monitoring the forum and providing hourly updates. “I’ve never seen so much inbound for one data set in my life,” he said.<br />What kind of week will it prove to have been in Chicago’s Loop, New Jersey or lower Manhattan, where electronic market-making trading firms have traditionally clustered? The wider spreads, higher volatility and big volume sparked by the Reddit-fueled trades are typically ripe conditions for market makers, which aim to facilitate trading by rapidly buying and selling. At some point trading can become too wild, and technology has strained to keep up with the volume. The attention on Robinhood Markets’ relationships with wholesale market makers that pay for its order flow, such as Citadel Securities, also has been intense. But by at least one measure, it wasn’t a bad week for market makers: Shares of publicly listed electronic market maker  Virtu Financial  rose 12%, its best weekly gain since last March.</td>

      <td>President Biden and his Democratic Party face a big decision this week, on whether to start trying to push into law a larger coronavirus stimulus bill on their own, or a smaller one with some Republican support.<br />Behind that decision lies an even bigger question: How much of a mandate did Democrats win in November’s election?<br />Mr. Biden and his team are pressing, as a matter of utmost urgency, a $1.9 trillion plan to speed coronavirus vaccinations and help cities, states and the overall economy get past the virus’ economic stranglehold. A group of 10 Republican senators has countered with a much smaller, $618 billion proposal that essentially keeps intact the Biden plan’s funds for vaccination work, shrinks some of the economic stimulus pieces and jettisons others entirely.<br />The Republicans’ proposal leaves the president standing between his two main opening-round promises: to take fast and big action on the virus, and to foster more bipartisanship in Washington.<br />The sentiment among many rank-and-file Democrats is clear. They argue that the size and urgency of the coronavirus package calls for steaming past Republican efforts to slow and shrink the plan and using whatever measures they have at their disposal to pass it, with only Democratic votes if necessary. They fear Republicans will force a downsizing of the package in negotiations, and then oppose it in the end anyway.</td>

      <td>With more Americans wearing masks of all sorts this winter, the full-faced ski mask is back in fashion. Yet, contemporary knitters take pains to make their balaclavas look less off-putting.</td>
      <td>DURING AMERICA’S first winter in the era of widespread face coverings, the curious and sometimes menacing balaclava has surged in popularity. In December, the outdoor emporium REI saw year-over-year sales of the slinky, ninja-evoking items spike 40% and niche retailers and craftspeople have been quickly selling out of small-batch versions for the past couple months. (For anyone who needs a refresher, balaclavas encase one’s head, except for openings that leave the eyes—and less often the mouth—visible.)<br />Boosting the zeistgeisty design’s visibility, raffish sorts like the rapper Fabolous and the NBA’s Russell Westbrook have been photographed recently with their faces cloaked in ski masks (Mr. Westbrook’s was a $50 number from his own fashion label, Honor the Gift.) And it’s worth mentioning that RMR, a sultry singer who wears a black balaclava at all times to cloak his identity, has been fueling the surge since he emerged last February in a viral music video.<br />It would seem these “mug for the camera” stars are tapping into the imposing balaclava’s cool factor. But for your average errand-runner, pulling on a knit balaclava is a purely practical move. Not only does it keep you warm, some treat a mouth-concealing balaclava as a face mask in a pinch when rushing to the post office. Yet a knitted balaclava offers less protection from airborne viruses than an N95 or even a taut cloth mask researchers say. Conscientious adopters of the trend wear a proper face mask beneath their balaclava.<br />Of course, keeping people toasty in sub-zero climes is the ski mask’s original raison d’etre. “In Winnipeg, it’s really, really freaking cold in the winter. So [balaclavas] definitely serve a purpose,” said Shawnee Isaak, 29, a gardener in the notoriously frigid Canadian province of Manitoba who began crafting her own balaclavas this winter. Like many at-home knitters, Ms. Isaak first learned how to stitch by studying YouTube videos. This winter she’s been perfecting her skills—she can now run off a ski mask in about five hours rather than the two days it used to take.<br />With more folks escaping outside this winter to shake off Covid containment boredom, the insulating balaclava is more welcome than ever. Gillian Stadelman, the senior merchandising strategist at REI, noted that sales of gear for “socially distanced” outdoor sports like snowshoeing and cross-country skiing are up as much as 300% year over year. She sees the outdoor outfitter’s balaclava bump as part of the same dynamic. More customers are looking to safely get their fitness in outdoors, and they’re dressing the part in full-face ski masks.</td>

      <td>The growing collaboration between civilian and military projects—once rare—comes as threats from Russia and China grow</td>
      <td>U.S. government and aerospace-industry officials are removing decades-old barriers between civilian and military space projects, in response to escalating foreign threats beyond the atmosphere.<br />The Pentagon and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are joining forces to tackle efforts such as exploring the region around the moon and extending the life of satellites. Many details are still developing or remain classified.<br />Driving the changes are actions by Moscow and Beijing to challenge American space interests with antisatellite weapons, jamming capabilities and other potentially hostile technology. Those secretive systems, often operated by specially trained forces focused on space dominance, threaten both U.S. military and private assets in orbit, according to a series of reports from the Pentagon, the White House National Space Council and industry study groups. As a result, the Pentagon is intent on tapping civilian expertise and programs to help gain an edge in this emerging warfighting domain.<br />The Space Force is at the center of the action. Gen. John Raymond, the fledgling military branch’s chief of operations, recently unveiled a research partnership with NASA aimed at shielding satellites from lasers or cyberattacks. Eventually, according to government and industry officials briefed on the matter, civil-military cooperation is expected to extend to defending planned NASA bases on the lunar surface, as well as protecting U.S. commercial operations envisioned to extract water or minerals there.<br />Large and small contractors are maneuvering to take advantage of opportunities to merge military and nonmilitary technologies. They include established military suppliers that already have a foot in both camps, such as  Northrop Grumman Corp. , the Dynetics unit of  Leidos Holdings Inc.  and Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. Smaller companies such as Maxar Technologies Holdings Inc., closely held robotic-lander maker Astrobotic Technology Inc. and small-satellite producer Blue Canyon Technologies, recently acquired by  Raytheon Technologies Corp. , also seek to diversify in the same way.</td>

      <td>Day traders fueling enormous gains in popular stocks such as  GameStop  Corp.  are also powering big swings for another suddenly hot investment: so-called blank-check companies.<br />Special-purpose acquisition companies—shell companies planning to merge with private firms to take them public—are rising more than 6% on average on their first day of trading in 2021, up from last year’s figure of 1.6%, according to University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter. Before 2020, trading in SPACs was muted when they made their debut on public markets.<br />Now, shares of blank-check companies almost always go up. The last 140 SPACs to go public have either logged gains or ended flat on their opening day of trading, per a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of trading in blank-check companies through Thursday. One hundred and seventeen in a row have risen in their first week. The gains tend to continue, on average generating bigger returns going out to a few months.<br />The gains in companies that don’t yet have any underlying business underscore the wave of speculation in today’s markets. Merging with a SPAC has become a popular way for startups in buzzy sectors to go public and take advantage of investor enthusiasm for futuristic themes.<br />But lately, day traders are even putting money into SPACs before they have revealed what company they are buying. At that stage, they are pools of cash, so investors are wagering that the company will eventually complete an attractive deal.</td>

      <td>Attempts to push up the metal’s price seem guided by mistaken ideas about the depth of this market and the monetary value of precious metals</td>
      <td>In 1896, former U.S. lawmaker and silver lover William Jennings Bryan attacked those that would “crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.” Reddit investors now risk building their own cross of silver.<br />On Monday, the price of silver futures jumped about 11% to around $30 an ounce—its biggest one-day move since 2009—after becoming the latest target of the individual investors who spent last week foiling Wall Street’s short bets. By coordinating security purchases online, these amateur day traders have triggered surges in unloved stocks such as  GameStop ,   BlackBerry  and  American Airlines .<br />“Silver Bullion Market is one of the most manipulated on earth,” user RocketBoomGo wrote Saturday on Reddit, encouraging individual investors to push the silver price up to $1,000. “Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. We know [that a] billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation.”<br />The Reddit crowd may have—so far—been successful in upending the market for little-traded stocks. In the far more liquid silver market, though, they may have worse luck.<br />Previous attempts to corner the silver market have failed. Back in 1979, three of the sons of Texan oil billionaire H.L. Hunt managed to push silver prices up eightfold, only for them to crash following a change in rules on leveraged purchases of commodities—notably on March 27, 1980, known as “Silver Thursday.” That happened despite the Hunt brothers owning more than a third of the world’s non-governmental supply of silver, which speaks to the difficulty of manipulating this deep market. Also, official data suggests hedge funds are betting in favor of silver, not against it. The chances of retail investors inflating a bubble that hurts Wall Street more than themselves seem even slimmer than with GameStop shares.</td>

Activists and journalists in the country feared they might also be arrested after civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior officials were detained in a predawn raid. Residents, who lived under military rule until the shift toward democracy during the past decade, rushed to buy groceries and withdraw cash from ATMs.<br />Diplomats said the situation was tense and it was hard to predict what turn events would take. There’s “almost a surreal sense, are we really going back to something which we thought we had left behind?” said a United Nations official based in Myanmar.<br />President Biden, who was vice president under the Obama administration when the U.S. backed Myanmar’s democratic revival, faces difficult decisions about what actions to take. As news of the coup emerged, the U.S. and some other foreign countries called on the military to restore democracy and free detained officials. “The military must reverse these actions immediately,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.<br />Myanmar’s military didn’t respond to requests for comment.</td>

      <td>The company looks set to surpass its last record earnings year in 2009—but the fact that that was so long ago holds some warnings for the future</td>
      <td>Nintendo  has ridden the stay-at-home wave toward another high score, far exceeding market expectations. But if it doesn’t heed the lessons of its last record-breaking year over a decade ago, investors might need to wait a long time for the next adrenaline rush.<br />The Japanese game giant’s operating profit for the quarter ending in December almost doubled from a year earlier. That is even higher than the most bullish estimate on S&P Global Market Intelligence. It’s also within touching distance of its most profitable quarter ever in 2008, when its Wii and DS consoles were selling like hot cakes. The Covid-19 pandemic has driven stay-at-home demand for its Switch consoles as well as games like “Animal Crossing: New Horizons.” Production and delivery bottlenecks also limited shipments of new competing consoles from  Sony  and  Microsoft  during the holiday season. Nintendo sold 24.1 million of its Switch consoles in the past three quarters, taking the total to nearly 80 million. Wii’s lifetime sales, in contrast, were 101.6 million units.<br />Nintendo will almost certainly have its most profitable year on record when the fiscal year ends this March. The company raised its operating profit forecast for the fiscal year by 24% Monday to ¥560 billion, equivalent to $5.34 billion, already higher than the record notched in the fiscal year ending in March, 2009. But that is likely still too conservative. Nintendo’s share price is also near a record high, only 13% below its 2007 peak, after gaining 42% since the beginning of 2020.<br />Nintendo’s current winning streak is reminiscent of the Wii console boom days more than a decade ago. With the Switch console going into its fifth year, Nintendo should be careful to avoid the subsequent bust that followed last time. The financial crisis and the rise of smartphones aggravated the situation back then. But the company didn’t manage to keep up the momentum from the runaway success of the Wii console. Wii U, the successor to Wii, was a flop. Nintendo dipped into losses for two consecutive years in 2013 and 2014.<br />Keeping gamers coming back with Nintendo’s own exclusive titles or an upgraded version of the Switch console will be key. Better online services could be another way to hold on to capricious gamers: Nintendo’s digital sales accounted for 41% of its total game sales over the past three quarters, an improvement from previous years. The pandemic has boosted Nintendo’s game business, but has also undermined an alternative way to make money from the company’s popular franchises: the opening of Super Nintendo World in Universal Studios Japan has been delayed twice.</td>

It said Mr. Biden made the invitation in a conversation with Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), who helped organize the Republican proposal.<br />The meeting with Mr. Biden and GOP senators was set for 5 p.m. ET Monday, according to the president’s public schedule released late Sunday.<br />In a letter Sunday, the Republican senators asked to meet with Mr. Biden to present details of their proposal and said they were coming forward in response to his appeal for bipartisanship.<br />The GOP proposal would cost around $600 billion, according to Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), who signed the letter, less than one-third of what Mr. Biden has proposed. Republicans said they would retain the $160 billion the Biden package includes to increase vaccinations and take other efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus, but strip or scale back other measures. The GOP plan, for instance, would reduce the $1,400 direct payments to Americans Mr. Biden has called for to roughly $1,000, Mr. Cassidy said on “Fox News Sunday.”</td>

      <td>Internet giant’s results expected to shed new light on the costs of its cloud business</td>
      <td>As Google steps on the gas at its burgeoning cloud business, investors would do well to remember that this is no cheap ride.<br />When parent company  Alphabet Inc.  reports fourth-quarter results Tuesday afternoon, the company plans to break out its Google Cloud business as a reportable segment. That will include information on the unit’s costs and profitability; Alphabet has been reporting Google Cloud revenue for a year now. The additional details should bring the company more in line with its top cloud peers  Amazon.com  and  Microsoft ,  both of which report segment profitability for their respective—though not easily comparable—cloud operations.<br />Investors have typically welcomed such details. Amazon’s share price more than doubled in 2015, helped greatly by the company’s decision to break out numbers for its AWS cloud business. Those details showed AWS to be more profitable than expected—and way more profitable than Amazon’s retail business. AWS’s operating margins were 12% in the first quarter of 2015 and they climbed to 24% by the end of the year. Amazon’s retail side was generating operating margins of less than 2% at the time.<br />That will be very hard for Google to match, though. Amazon in 2015 had a very big lead in the cloud market, which gave it the ability to take some profits while still investing heavily in the business. Google—running a distant third to Amazon and Microsoft—is playing an expensive game of catch up. Its capital expenditures have averaged 14% of revenue over the past five years compared with 10% for both Amazon and Microsoft. Speaking of Google’s Cloud business, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on the company’s last earnings call that they “do intend to maintain a high level of investment given the opportunity we see.”<br />Google also has a much more profitable mainstay business. With 81% of revenue still coming from advertising, Alphabet’s core Google division has generated operating margins of 24% over the past four quarters. The cloud represents Google’s best shot yet to diversify that business, so Google is right to shine more light on it. Investors should just brace for some sticker shock.</td>

Wild moves in the value of those stocks and options prompted clearinghouses that process and settle trades to demand increased cash collateral to insulate themselves from possible losses.<br />“The request was around $3 billion, which is, you know, about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is,” Robinhood Chief Executive Vlad Tenev said. He spoke Sunday night in an interview alongside Tesla boss Elon Musk on a live stream of Clubhouse, an invitation-only social networking app popular in Silicon Valley.<br />A Robinhood spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the online interview.<br />Robinhood blocked trading in more than a dozen stocks and related options on Thursday. It loosened restrictions Friday but still allowed only limited trading. Mr. Tenev said the trading app will be able to further relax the “stringent position limits” on the securities on Monday after last week’s capital raise.</td>

      <td>Myanmar’s military seized control of the government on Monday, detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and senior members of her National League for Democracy party and dealing a major blow to the country’s historic transition to democracy.<br />Tensions with the military have risen in recent months after Ms. Suu Kyi’s party won national elections in a landslide, and the military-backed opposition party disputed the election process. The military alleged that the voter lists had false names and said its attempts to resolve the issue were rebuffed by the election commission. The election commission has denied there was widespread election fraud.<br />On Monday, which was scheduled to be the first day of parliament since the elections, the military said it was imposing a state of emergency.<br />Yes. Myanmar’s military never fully relinquished power, retaining control of key government ministries and a chunk of parliamentary seats even after Ms. Suu Kyi’s party was elected in 2015. But the coup puts the military fully back in control. Power has been transferred to army chief Min Aung Hlaing, according to an announcement made Monday on an army-run television channel.<br />Ms. Suu Kyi is the daughter of Aung San, a politician and military leader who helped the country gain independence from British colonial rule in 1948. She rose to prominence decades later when she took on the country’s generals and was put under house arrest in 1989, a year before the party she led won national elections. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 and spent 15 years in detention over two decades, becoming one of the world’s most prominent political prisoners. She was released in 2010 as the country began its transition to democracy. Her party, the National League for Democracy, came to power in a 2015 vote that marked a historic shift in the country’s politics. She has served in the role of state counselor rather than president, but effectively led the Southeast Asian country before Monday’s coup.</td>

      <td>CVS, Walgreens, Kroger and others will require appointments, hope to avoid logjams as they join national effort</td>
      <td>Some of America’s biggest retailers are preparing to take a central role in administering Covid-19 shots, hoping to avoid logjams and other complications that have slowed the vaccine rollout’s early days.<br />The U.S. fell far short of its initial goal of inoculating 20 million people by the end of 2020, with health departments, hospital systems and long-term-care facilities beset by supply-chain bottlenecks, vaccine hesitancy and confusing, scattershot systems for making appointments.<br />Not all Americans are eligible for the vaccines, and shots remain in short supply. But vaccines are becoming more broadly available in some states, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention aims to make them available in local pharmacies beginning next month. There is no cost to receive the vaccine.<br />(Check the WSJ’s state-by-state guide.)<br />The job of vaccinating large swaths of the population will fall largely on retail pharmacies, with companies such as  CVS Health Corp. ,  Walgreens -Boots Alliance Inc.,  Walmart Inc.  and  Kroger Co.  saying they are prepared to give tens of millions of shots a month.</td>

      <td>Investors have little way to gauge the likely success of new electric-vehicle ventures before they launch their make-or-break products</td>
      <td>Here’s a rule of thumb for investors looking for the next Tesla: Wait for the futuristic vehicles pictured in company presentations to hit the road.<br />Electric-vehicle startups are racing onto the stock market through special-purpose acquisition companies or SPACs. The latest is Faraday Future, which after years of financial troubles has finally bagged a deal to get its first luxury EV to launch next year. Shares in  Property Solutions Acquisition Corp. , the blank-check company acquiring Faraday, have risen 42% since the announcement Thursday.<br />The happy couple join at least a dozen other EV ventures and SPACs that have announced similar mergers over the past half year or so. The deals have triggered trading surges and stock-market valuations ranging from speculative to incomprehensible, underpinned by the rally in Tesla’s even more highly valued shares.<br />Not all of the startups will compete head on with Tesla like Faraday and Fisker, another Californian company with a luxury EV in the works. Others want to develop battery EVs for commercial transportation (Lordstown, Arrival,  Canoo ); trucks powered by hydrogen (Nikola); or next-generation batteries ( QuantumScape ).<br />What these companies have in common, though, is a reliance on big products to transform their finances and justify their valuations in two, three or more years’ time. In an increasingly crowded market, not all these products can live up to their billing, but some just might. How to know which?</td>

      <td>Hong Kong judge acquits Catherine Leung Kar-cheung of bribing a potential client by offering his son a job at the bank</td>
      <td>A former senior banker at  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. was acquitted of bribing a potential client by hiring his son, in a defeat for Hong Kong’s antigraft agency.<br />Deputy District Judge Emily Cheung on Monday ruled that Catherine Leung Kar-cheung, a former vice chairwoman of  JPMorgan ’s  Asia-Pacific investment banking business, wasn’t guilty of two counts of bribery.<br />Ms. Leung had been charged in May 2019 with bribing a businessman to win a mandate for an initial public offering, in a case brought by the city’s Independent Commission Against Corruption.<br />Her prosecution came after JPMorgan faced U.S. scrutiny for its so-called Sons and Daughters program, in which bankers in Asia offered internships and jobs to relatives of clients and prospective clients to win investment-banking business between 2006 and 2013. In 2016, JPMorgan admitted it had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and agreed to pay $264 million to resolve U.S. civil and criminal charges.<br />The ICAC’s case hinged on emails sent by Ms. Leung to colleagues, including one about the IPO which said: “We are a strong contender. Blink Blink nod nod, can we find a place for his son…” Another email that said while the young man “does not interview well,” he was likely to get a job offer from somewhere given an IPO mandate was up for grabs.</td>
