      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. on Tuesday blacklisted several Chinese companies for allegedly helping North Korea export its coal, part of a renewed effort by the Trump administration to stem critical revenue sources for Kim Jong Un’s regime.<br />The Treasury Department sanctioned six companies, including four Chinese firms and four ships they own, that officials said show China’s government is failing to adequately enforce United Nations sanctions against North Korea.<br />The sanctions block any assets the companies have within U.S. jurisdiction and could complicate their dealings overseas, including the ships’ ability to transport goods.<br />Tuesday’s action follows the November blacklisting of several Russian companies the Treasury said are exporting North Korean laborers to Russia and China, as well as a new reward program offering up to $5 million for reports on sanctions-evasion by Pyongyang and its facilitators.<br />The Treasury Department said Chinese authorities must implement and enforce the U.N. Security Council resolutions, including by taking action against companies, individuals, and vessels that engage in prohibited trade. Tensions between the two world powers over North Korea have added to diplomatic friction over a range of economic and national security issues, including sanctions against top Chinese officials levied by the U.S. Monday for what it says is Beijing’s erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy.</td>

      <td>“Closed GM Factory Spawns Wave of Industrial Migrants” (Page One, Nov. 30) left me in tears, as it reminded me of my father’s sacrifice for his family. In the early 1980s, my dad lost a good factory job with Clark Equipment Co. in Jackson, Mich. After two years of unemployment, he finally found another good-paying job 200 miles away with BorgWarner. During my freshman year in high school, my dad moved into an apartment in Muncie, Ind.<br />For much of the last five years of his life, he felt the pain and endured the challenges of being separated from his family. So much in the stories of these GM workers who left their families behind when the factory in Lordstown, Ohio, shut down—such as rooming with a workmate, taking a lot of overtime and coming home only on weekends—my dad experienced as well. His sacrifice kept an awkward and shy 13-year-old boy from being uprooted from his friends and the only home he had ever known.<br />At the time, I realized the benefit to myself. However, it was only in retrospect that I appreciated the high cost that my dad paid to provide for his family with the least disruption to our lives. I thank my dad, John Mullaly, for his sacrifice. I would also like to tell the GM workers that though Lordstown no longer makes cars, from what I read, it still makes great fathers and husbands.<br />Timothy Mullaly<br />Memphis, Tenn.</td>

The bill, which secures pay rates for troops and other crucial military spending items, has passed on a bipartisan basis for 59 years in a row.<br />The president said Congress must jettison a provision in the annual bill that would create a commission to rename military installations, monuments and paraphernalia honoring Confederate commanders, as well as include language to terminate Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which grants social-media companies broad immunity for the content they publish from users on their site.<br />Mr. Trump also added two demands he hadn’t made earlier, saying the bill must “allow for 5G & troupe reductions in foreign lands!”<br />While Republicans and Democrats in Congress have indicated in recent days that they intend to pass the bill over Mr. Trump’s objections, the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the chamber’s most conservative lawmakers, said Tuesday they would oppose the NDAA and support Mr. Trump’s veto.</td>

The headphones, which go on sale today and begin shipping next week, are coming a little more than a year after Apple introduced a high-end version of its AirPods wireless earbuds. AirPods are now one of Apple’s most successful new products.<br />The Cupertino, Calif., company also said it plans next week to begin selling a subscription fitness service around its Apple Watch costing $10 a month or $80 a year. The announcement puts Apple in steeper competition with  Peloton Interactive Inc.,  which in addition to its fitness equipment has invested in its digital platform that offers subscriptions to workout classes and more.<br />In recent years, Apple has been looking to broaden its offering of wearable products and services through them amid slowing iPhone sales, though the company has recently benefited from an uptick in demand for its laptops, iPads and digital services due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Apple’s over-the-ear headphone offerings for years had been centered on its Beats products.

      <td><br /><br /><br />Why go to an art museum? Yes, you can usually get a good lunch there, but this isn’t a trick question: You go there to look at great art, delight in it and learn more about it. Very few of us will ever own a Manet or a Mark Rothko, but you can see examples of their work hanging in American museums from coast to coast, an experience that is nothing like looking at a reproduction in a coffee-table book. Or, at least, you could see them: The Covid-19 pandemic has forced many major art museums to close or sharply limit their viewing capacity, and many art lovers are now understandably reluctant to visit those museums that remain open.<br />How, then, can people who love art continue to enrich their aesthetic lives in something like the manner to which they’re accustomed? New York’s Museum of Modern Art has a very good answer. “Virtual Views: Van Gogh’s ‘Starry Night’” is an online “exhibition” devoted to one of MoMA’s most familiar and best-loved paintings. It includes an introductory video and a Q&A session with Ann Temkin, the museum’s chief curator of painting and sculpture, followed by a “performative reading” by the actor-playwright Anna Deavere Smith of the correspondence between Vincent van Gogh and his brother Theo. The package also includes several other choice items, including “a cosmologist’s take on the painting’s famous sky.”</td>

But he also took aim at the way the Justice Department had tried to dismiss the case in May, suggesting that but for the pardon, he may have denied their bid and either forced Mr. Flynn to go to trial or to jail.<br />Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “Dismissal is, of course, the correct result.”<br />Sidney Powell, a lawyer who represents Mr. Flynn, accused Judge Sullivan of bias.

It also determined that the Army’s uniformed criminal investigators on base were undertrained and overworked, which prevented them from properly investigating sex crimes and soldier deaths.

      <td>A federal deadline Tuesday marks the latest formal step toward confirming President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, further reducing options for President Trump and his supporters to fight the results.<br />States were supposed to try to resolve any disputes over the presidential results and finalize their slate of electors for the Electoral College by Tuesday. It is known as the “Safe Harbor” deadline because, if met, Congress should accept a state’s results as conclusive and reject any further challenges, according to federal law.<br />The deadline usually passes with little notice. This year, the Trump campaign and its allies have so far unsuccessfully launched a battery of lawsuits and sought to persuade some state legislatures to overturn the election results, drawing extra attention to the arcane formalities that states and Congress take to confirm the next president in time for the inauguration on Jan. 20.<br />The “Safe Harbor” deadline doesn’t necessarily end those or other lawsuits. But given that Congress is supposed to respect the results of states that meet the deadline, and with the Electoral College vote coming Monday, it narrows the options for challenging the outcome, according to election law scholars.<br />“I don’t think it’s the kind of the deadline that’s going to bring true finality,” said Richard L. Hasen, an election-law professor at the University of California, Irvine. “It’s more like another nail in the coffin.”</td>

      <td>A Netflix series offers gripping documentary portraits of four remarkable doctors.</td>
      <td>As unlikely as it sounds, “The Surgeon’s Cut” is really about artists. Their métier may be on the margins of medical science—heart transplants, brain surgery, liver grafting, procedures inside the womb—but their personalities are as large, singular and even eccentric as the most “creative” individuals. They possess the same kind of vision and the same kind of drive. What they manage to do is create miracles. What the program’s four directors create—let’s call it a minor miracle—is something that does justice to their subjects.<br />The astonishments in the four-part production are manifold—the surgeries, of course, but the stories, too. Each doctor’s history, already the outcome of often uncanny happenstance and fortune, contains a wrenching twist in the plotline, a revelation that—coming as it does after every other remarkable thing—doesn’t seem possible. And wouldn’t be, if this were fiction.<br />Documentaries often succeed, rightly or wrongly, on the basis of how sympathetic their characters are. Each of the principals in “The Surgeon’s Cut” could be reciting an actuarial table and still be fascinating, but the things that they do explain, in clean, uncluttered fashion, are almost otherworldly. Kypros Nicolaides, the star of episode 1 (“Saving Life Before Birth,” directed by James Newton), is based at King’s College Hospital in London, where one of his specialties is endoscopic laser surgery on fetuses suffering “twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome”: One twin is getting too little blood, which means it is not developing; the other is getting too much, which means a strain on its heart. What Dr. Nicolaides does—through a lens we get to share—is breathtaking, and nerve-racking and not always 100% successful. But the efforts are, by definition, heroic. Likewise, Dr. Nicolaides.<br />Directed by Lucy Blakstad, episode 2 (“Sacred Brain”) is the most overtly cinematic of the four segments and perhaps the best story: Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., grew up in Mexicali, Mexico, within view of the U.S. border fence; as a kid he practiced climbing over it and at age 19 succeeded, only to be put in a detention center. Later, he became a migrant worker in California, took English classes, went to night school, entered the University of California, Berkeley, and later medical school. “I went from harvest to Harvard in seven years,” he says, in a way that tips us off that he’s used the line before (which only makes it more charming). What he calls the “faraway”—the place he and his friends would talk about as kids—turned out to be the human brain, which Dr. Quiñones-Hinojosa regards as a sacred space, “like the gateway to a magical temple,” and from which he excises the most intractable tumors.<br />The mystical aspect of the doctor’s art, rooted in his mix of Catholicism and indigenous culture, is invoked by Ms. Blakstad in several strikingly artistic moments—the doctor spinning around in the OR, for instance, and becoming a Mexican kid spinning around in an archival film. In another sequence, a truckload of migrant workers in the back of a pickup is being passed up by a camera in a car—a car that the camera then suggests is being driven by Dr. Quiñones-Hinojosa himself.</td>

      <td>Likely to captivate viewers young and old, an animated film roots its fantastical story in the island’s tortured history.</td>
      <td>‘Family entertainment” often means something parents can sit through without clawing the armrest off the couch. But the animated “Wolfwalkers” is a different sort of beast. With its enchanted forests, shape-shifting wood sprites and a plucky heroine named Robyn Goodfellowe, the film is terrific fare for kids. But the underpinnings of its fantastical story lie in tortured Irish history, English imperialism, and the use of religion to rationalize oppression; there’s a hum of yearning for a pre-Christian Hibernia of pagans, Druids and nature worship. Adults will be eager to see where it’s all going to go.<br />Where Robyn goes, early on, is the scullery. “Work is prayer,” she is told by the crone-in-chief—and it’s one of the more frightening moments in a film full of formidable action, near-calamity and wolf-imperilment. The setting is Kilkenny, Ireland, in 1650—the very year that capital of the Irish Catholic Confederacy fell to Oliver Cromwell. His name is never mentioned, but he is embodied in the evil Lord Protector (voice of Simon McBurney), who is on hand to enforce order and quell political dissent. The chief source of that dissent are the wolves who inhabit the surrounding forest, along with the Wolfwalkers—young Mebh, who sounds like a 2020 Dublin tween, and her mother, Moll (voices of Eva Whittaker and Maria Doyle Kennedy). They are human-like but possess wolf avatars that leave their sleeping bodies and roam the troubled countryside.<br />Robyn (voice of Honor Kneafsey) is a recent arrival from England, having come with her Roundhead father, who is the Lord Protector’s chief wolf exterminator. Robyn wants to be a wolf hunter, too, until she comes to understand the injustices being done to the wolves and the land. “What cannot be tamed must be destroyed,” says the Lord Protector, who is prepared to burn down the forest if he can’t control it. Cromwell’s policies in Ireland were genocidal, so the villainy is not misplaced.<br />The intentions of the Will Collins screenplay, and the direction (and art direction) of directors Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, aren’t anti-Christian, per se: As we are told early on, St. Patrick made a deal “with the pagans” to keep the locals close to home and leave the wolves and Wolfwalkers alone; it is the Puritans who are big-footing it around the woods. And the byproducts of worship are certainly celebrated: The visual elements of the animation include the Celtic spirals, interlacing patterns and stained-glass-evoking geometry that are found in the illuminated manuscripts of Dark Ages Ireland. (Mr. Moore also directed 2009’s “The Secret of Kells,” about the Book of Kells, with Nora Twomey, who is a producer here.) The style elsewhere ranges from Monet-like depictions of the wildest Ireland to naive depictions of the village of Kilkenny that suggest perspective-free medieval painting. The Wolfwalkers are aswirl in color and motion; the townsfolk are flat and more cartoonish. But even they seem inspired by the often simple representations of humans rendered by those anonymous illustrators of the monasteries.<br />Among the many clever and understated virtues of “Wolfwalkers” (politics, for instance, are never mentioned) is the way the animals are characterized. The Lord Protector calls the wolves “foul” and “wicked.” In one fulminating moment he says, “By God’s clarity and judgment He vanquishes thee,” though nothing of the sort happens. But there’s no anthropomorphizing by the movie itself: Wolves are wolves, even though the ones here do hang out with very enchanted people.</td>

      <td>Yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury declines for second straight session</td>
      <td>U.S. government-bond yields fell Tuesday, driven lower by investors’ concerns about the prospects for Brexit trade negotiations and a U.S. emergency economic relief package.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note finished trading Tuesday at 0.913%, according to Tradeweb. That’s the second-straight session decline and down from 0.928% at Monday’s close. The 30-year yield fell to 1.659%, from 1.687% Monday.<br />Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, retreated Tuesday as investors waited for developments on the Brexit trade negotiations. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that securing a trade deal at a coming summit with the European Union will be difficult before the Dec. 31 deadline. That uncertainty is driving some investors to havens such as U.S. Treasurys.<br />In the U.S., delays on bills covering economic relief and government spending are also pressuring yields, some analysts said. Lawmakers on Monday struggled to resolve stumbling blocks while seeking a deal on the emergency pandemic relief program. Congressional leaders said they plan to pass a one-week extension of government funding legislation to buy more time for negotiations.<br />Those strains have helped reverse a recent rise in Treasury yields, which tend to climb when investors expect economic growth and inflation. The prospect of a vaccine-fueled economic rebound recently helped push 10-year yields to their highest close in nearly a month near 1%, a level not surpassed since before the pandemic.</td>

      <td>New AirPods Max headphones may follow HomePod rather than AirPods trajectory</td>
      <td>Apple Inc.’s  new headphones are at least aptly named.<br />The company announced the AirPods Max on Tuesday morning. Its first Apple-branded entry into the wireless, over-ear headphone market carries an eye-popping price tag of $549—57% higher than the most expensive line of comparable headphones from its own Beats lineup. The new earphones begin shipping next week.<br />Apple has never been one for bargain hunters and its success so far with its AirPods lineup has likely emboldened its approach to the audio market. The company launched the first version in late 2016 for $159—a fair premium to other wireless buds at the time. But the AirPods sound quality and ease-of-use relative to the competition were enough to overcome ridicule about their design. The buds sold strong out of the gate and paved the way for an even more expensive Pro version that launched late last year. Apple credited AirPods as the top driver of growth for its wearables segment, which saw revenue surge 25% to $30.6 billion for the company’s fiscal year that ended in September.<br />But Apple’s premium pricing strategy doesn’t always work out so well. The company’s first HomePod smart speaker launched in early 2018 at $350—more than twice the price of  Amazon ’s  Echo that ruled the smart speaker category at the time. The HomePod sold poorly: Futuresource Consulting estimates it garnered about 4% of smart speaker sales that year. Apple has since cut the HomePod’s price by $50 and launched a much more price-competitive version last month called the HomePod Mini for $99.<br />The new AirPods Max seems more likely to follow the latter’s track. The over-ear headphone market is a fragmented one, with prices ranging from well under $100 to audiophile offerings costing well over $1,000. But the current average selling price for over-ear, wireless headphones with noise canceling is around $230, according to Ben Arnold of NPD Group. And sales in this category have been falling, with revenue down 45% for the first 10 months of this year compared with the same period last year as consumers have been showing a strong preference for wireless buds, according to NPD data.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said that Congress should take up a coronavirus relief bill that excludes Republican and Democratic priorities that currently lack bipartisan agreement and instead address those issues in an additional package next year.<br />Mr. McConnell on Tuesday said lawmakers should set aside aid for state and local governments and liability protections, two issues that have bedeviled lawmakers in the year-end effort to pass another aid package. He made the comments  as both parties are eager to strike a deal quickly but struggled to agree on details.<br />Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) rejected Mr. McConnell’s idea and accused him of trying to sabotage talks. He is “trying to pull the rug out from beneath” the negotiators, Mr. Schumer said.<br />In another development, Trump administration officials asked Senate Republicans to press to include $600 direct checks in any relief package, according to people familiar with the discussions. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin advocated for the $600 check, half the size of the first round of checks, while Mr. Trump would be willing to include a larger check, the people said. The current bipartisan framework doesn’t include any such direct payments.<br />Mr. McConnell said that a package this year should focus on money for vaccine distribution, health-care providers and small businesses, pointing to President-elect Joe Biden’s plans to work on another relief package in his administration as another opportunity to work out the outstanding issues.</td>

And I think they’re taking them for granted a little bit.”<br />Mr. Musk made the comments Tuesday during The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council annual summit in an interview with Editor in Chief Matt Murray.<br />Startup executives and employees have fled the San Francisco Bay Area for cheaper locales since the pandemic has led to remote working conditions.

And the more stressed, disconnected or lonely a person has felt, the greater the negative impact on his or her sex life has been.<br />It’s no surprise no one’s feeling sexy. We don’t like how we look, sitting around in our schlubbiest clothes, packing on pandemic pounds, getting hairier and smellier. (How long has it been since you bathed?) We’re not out in the world, doing the things that give us confidence, such as hobbies or travel. We’ve been deprived of so many daily moments of connection—the conversations, smiles or glances—that make us feel energized and alive.<br />And even if we’re not fighting with our partner—because, let’s face it, we’re in constant fight or flight mode—we’re still a little sick of the person we’ve been cooped up with 24/7.

It was the first of eight finished MAX planes expected to be delivered to United by end of the year.<br />The United spokesman said the airline would inspect and test-fly each MAX before reintroducing the aircraft back into passenger service in the first quarter of next year. Pilots also would have to undergo new training approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.<br />The resumption of MAX deliveries is crucial to Boeing’s effort to stop bleeding cash by the end of next year or early 2022. The world-wide grounding since March 2019 has left Boeing unable to hand over finished MAX aircraft to customers who pay much of the sales price upon receipt.<br />The manufacturer had sought to resume deliveries late last year before regulators approved fixes to the aircraft’s flight-control system and related pilot training. The push ultimately faltered.</td>

      <td>Labels like Burberry and Marni are selling curious men’s shirts cobbled together from motley fabrics and patterns. Enticingly trendy or just terrifying?</td>
      <td>THERE’S A JOKEY line that men’s fashion designers rely on when presenting a collection of glaringly ho-hum button-ups and blazers: “What do you expect me to create, a shirt with three sleeves?” The remark is hammy, reflexive, but I get it. When you consider anatomical limitations and the constraints of good taste, designers can only rejigger men’s staples so many ways.<br />Or, so I thought. This month I came across a clothing item that pushed this notion of mutant shirts out of the hypothetical realm.  Burberry ,  the brand best known for Bogart’s “Casablanca” trench coat, has created a plaid flannel shirt apparently designed for a three-headed creature.<br />It has three collars: the central one through which an actual human head goes, and then two dummy button-down collars tacked on each shoulder like a linebacker’s pads, purely for effect. Though startling, this Cerberus-friendly mishmash is merely the most extreme manifestation of a trend: Other labels, from the lofty (Milan fashion house Marni) to the egalitarian (Uniqlo), have been cobbling together their own Frankenshirts.<br />More tame, the Uniqlo shirt pieces together four panels of contrasting, but uniformly dark, patterns. This orderly collage evokes Brooks Brothers’s preppy “fun shirts,” early examples of refashioned tops that, starting in the 1970s, were birthed from leftover scraps lying around the label’s shirt factory.<br />A similar leave-no-scrap-behind ethos propels the patchwork shirts of today, said Damien Paul, the head of menswear at London-based retailer Matchesfashion: “The whole point of patchwork and piecing fabrics together is about using what is available.” The examples Matches sells are quite rambunctious. To construct one hectic button-up on offer, London’s Ahluwalia label crisscrossed fragments of old striped dress shirts in a pell-mell manner. Rebuild, a line by Japanese brand Needles, sews vertical strips of different vintage flannels into wearable mayhem.</td>

      <td>The coronavirus pandemic has wiped out this year’s edition of one of the most storied rivalries in college football, as Michigan announced Tuesday that it will not play Ohio State this weekend due to a continuing outbreak on the Wolverines roster.<br />The cancellation carries heavy postseason implications for No. 4 Ohio State, which is no longer eligible to play in the Big Ten Championship despite being the last undefeated team in the conference. The Buckeyes will finish the regular season with a maximum of six games. But absent a conference championship it’s unclear if that will be enough to convince the College Football Playoff selection committee that they should get a spot in the semifinal over a 9-1 Southeastern Conference team.<br />Iowa Athletic Director Gary Barta, who chairs the CFP selection committee, has previously said that the number of games a team plays isn’t necessarily a disqualifying factor for making one of the College Football Playoff semifinals. The fewer games a team plays, the more the committee will invoke the notoriously subjective “eye test.”<br />“It is a challenge and a problem to evaluate a team that is played three games and try to evaluate them side-by-side with a team that is played nine games,” said Barta upon release of the second edition of the committee’s rankings on Dec. 1. “We’re doing it, it is doable. But it clearly becomes one of the pieces of the puzzle.”<br />The cancellation also carries consequences for Michigan, which sits at a disappointing 2-4 and whose coach, Jim Harbaugh, is entering the last year of his contract. Harbaugh is 0-4 against Ohio State during his tenure, but at a program like Michigan a win over the Buckeyes can buy a lot of goodwill from passionate fans and university regents.</td>

A final vote to approve his nomination is scheduled for later Tuesday.<br />Mr. Simington, a 41-year-old Republican lawyer currently serving in the Trump administration, appears likely to clash with Democrats over issues from “net neutrality” rules to the agency’s role in overseeing social-media content moderation under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.<br />FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, has said he is leaving the agency on Jan. 20, President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration day.<br />That could leave the bipartisan commission with two Democratic and two Republican members, including Mr. Simington. Mr. Biden can immediately designate one of the sitting Democratic commissioners as chair. But the agency’s new leader wouldn’t hold a 3-2 majority until Mr. Biden names, and the Senate approves, a fifth FCC member—a process that could stretch months if Republicans control the Senate.</td>

McDonald’s executives said in a meeting with U.S. franchisees about the fees on Monday that owners are free to raise prices.<br />“The family business is absolutely a priority. We just believe the dollars are better invested elsewhere,” said Charlie Strong, chief field officer for McDonald’s U.S.A., during the call listened to by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Franchisees at hotels, restaurants and other consumer companies have fought with corporate offices recently over fees, promotions and supply costs.

      <td>Portugal’s benchmark bond traded with a negative yield, signaling investors’ increasingly relaxed attitudes toward a country that was once among the worst-hit by the European debt crisis.<br />The yield on the southern European country’s 10-year government bond on Tuesday fell to a low of minus 0.009%, according to  Tradeweb .<br />Portugal joins countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands whose debt also has subzero yields. It reflects that demand for the bonds is so high that investors who hold the bonds to maturity would get back less than they initially paid. It is also another sign of a turnaround in the market’s expectations for a more cohesive European Union.<br />A deep financial crisis in the early 2010s hit Portugal along with a number of other southern European countries, which resulted in government intervention in its banking sector. Divides emerged between northern and southern European nations, and concerns about the trade bloc fragmenting arose—resulting in significantly higher borrowing costs for countries seen as riskier and in dubious financial shape, including Portugal.<br />The coronavirus pandemic has had the opposite effect and is perceived to have brought Europe closer together, according to Rohan Khanna, a rates strategist at  UBS .  Policy makers have been actively supporting member states, both at the central bank and the European Commission, the trade bloc’s executive arm, which agreed on a €750 billion spending package, equivalent to $908 million, known as the recovery fund in July.</td>

      <td>CEO John Stankey expects coronavirus pandemic to scare many people away from theaters</td>
      <td>AT&T Inc.  Chief Executive John Stankey defended the decision to release all Warner Bros. movies online the same day they hit theaters next year, arguing that the film producer had to tweak a 2020 playbook that wasn’t working during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The telecom company’s Warner Bros. unit said last week that it will release its entire 2021 film slate on HBO Max, a new film and television library designed to compete with online services such as Netflix and Disney+. The plan covers 17 movies from the science-fiction epic “Dune” to another installment of the “Matrix” franchise.<br />The choice shocked a film industry accustomed to releasing big-budget films in stages, with cinema owners getting the first bite. But U.S. box-office ticket sales have cratered since coronavirus-related restrictions shut down many venues. Those that reopened are struggling to attract large audiences.<br />“We know we probably needed to try something different,” Mr. Stankey said Tuesday during a virtual investor conference hosted by investment bank UBS Group AG. “Our feeling was, in the theatrical business, based on our best discussion with experts, we were going to be in a situation where the psyche of the population and people’s willingness to go back into large venues—that’s going to be a little bit of a prolonged recovery.”<br />Hollywood and much of the creative community has reacted angrily both to Warner Bros.’s strategy and to the short notice its executives gave their business partners. Theater owners fear that releasing the movies simultaneously on HBO Max and the big screen will drive a stake through their business.</td>

      <td>Elon Musk is smart to turn paper gains into cash, and speculators would be wise to follow his example</td>
      <td>Tesla  is wisely ringing the cash register amid a stunning stock rally. Speculators should take notice.<br />The car company said on Tuesday morning that it plans to sell up to $5 billion in stock just two weeks before it is set to join the S&P 500. It would be Tesla’s second such share issue since September.<br />The sale is a no-brainer for Tesla’s long-term health. After all, the stock has more than doubled since August, when the company announced a share split, and it has rallied more than 50% in the three weeks since its planned index inclusion was announced.<br />The timing is no longer one of immediate need for liquidity: Tesla ended the third quarter with $14.5 billion in cash on its books. Still, opportunities to turn bubble stock gains into real cash shouldn’t be squandered. With this coming infusion, Tesla has likely assured its long-term corporate survival barring some extreme scenario.<br />But the long-term fate of its stock is far less certain. Tesla’s market value, which touched $600 billion on Monday, is nearly 10 times that of  General Motors ,  which dwarfs Tesla in terms of market share, profitability, and financial might. Tesla trades at more than 1,200 times trailing earnings, while established automotive industry peers go for eight times or less.</td>

      <td>‘Stakeholder capitalism’ allows the Davos crowd to obfuscate what counts as success for a business.</td>
      <td>The World Economic Forum knows never to let a good crisis go to waste. The organization behind the famous conference of politicians, executives, celebrities and “thought leaders” at Davos is now promoting an initiative called “The Great Reset.” The idea is to repackage shibboleths of the technocratic center-left for the marketing opportunity presented by Covid-19.<br />Quite a few of these policies are dangerous, but one deserves special attention: stakeholder capitalism.  Apple ,   Facebook ,   IBM  and  Walmart ,  all listed as corporate partners on the World Economic Forum website, are evidently on board with a vague and open-ended mandate for corporations to do good in the world. Yet beneath the lofty rhetoric, stakeholder capitalism is mostly a front for irresponsible corporatism. It is an attempt to siphon off cash flow from productive uses to advance the mission of “global governance” and create corporate and government sinecures for cronies along the way.<br />Milton Friedman famously fixed the modern paradigm of shareholder capitalism in a 1970 article. Writing against the dangers he perceived in popular notions of corporate social responsibility, Friedman argued that the chief duty of business was “to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception fraud.” Friedman noted correctly that, in a market economy, profits represent value created for customers. In their capacity as corporate officers, businessmen could do the most good by focusing on their bottom lines.<br />The self-perceived aristoi of Western liberal democracies hated this argument and have fought it ever since. Business leaders, eager to avoid the moral taint of greed, have often led the anti-Friedman coalition. In 2019 the CEOs of the Business Roundtable released a statement affirming that they “endeavor every day to create value for all our stakeholders, whose long-term interests are inseparable.” By stakeholders they mean “customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.”<br />As National Review’s Andrew Stuttaford notes, this vision of wide-ranging corporate beneficence introduces a host of principal-agent problems in ordinary business decision-making. Profit is a concrete and clarifying metric that allows shareholders—owners—to hold executives accountable for their performance. Adding multiple goals not related to profit introduces needless confusion.</td>

      <td>Covid relief is no ‘blue-state bailout.’ The virus doesn’t respect political boundaries.</td>
      <td>As Congress presses to complete an emergency Covid-19 relief bill, aid to states and localities continues to be a point of contention. But the novel coronavirus respects neither geographical boundaries nor partisan affiliations. Heartland states that thought they were safe turned rapidly into hot spots. As the costs of caring for the sick and trying to protect the healthy have surged, tax revenue has declined sharply. Most states and cities have responded by cutting their budgets while hoping for some assistance from the federal government. Without it, they will be forced to make even deeper cuts.<br />These cuts matter because governors and mayors are mostly in the business of delivering services their constituents need. No federal relief means less funding for education, roads, courts and police, firefighters and motor-vehicle departments. Libraries and public parks will be on the chopping block, as will the fight against opioid addiction. State and local payrolls, which have shrunk by 1.3 million, will be cut further, reducing consumer purchasing power and putting jobs in the private economy at risk.<br />This is a humanitarian challenge but also a macroeconomic problem. Reduced state and local revenue slowed the recovery from the 2007-09 recession, and the Federal Reserve chairman isn’t alone in fearing that it could happen again. Job creation has slowed for five consecutive months, and the economic recovery from the pandemic shock threatens to stall with employment almost 10 million jobs below its peak in February. The official unemployment rate is still high, and it would be higher if not for the distressing decline in labor-force participation. Millions of discouraged Americans have left the labor force, and a slow recovery will make it even harder to get them back into it.<br />Despite what some politicians are saying, federal assistance wouldn’t be a “blue-state bailout.” Some of the reddest states are among the hardest hit, not because they spend profligately but because their economies are especially vulnerable to disruption by the pandemic. Revenue in states that depend on energy taxes—Alaska, Wyoming and North Dakota, among others—have been hit hard by declining oil prices, as have revenues in states such as Florida that rely heavily on tourism.<br />Not surprisingly, governors have joined forces to advocate for continued federal assistance. The National Governors Association represents all 50 governors, 26 Republicans and 24 Democrats. On Dec. 4, the NGA’s leaders—New York Democrat Andrew Cuomo and Arkansas Republican Asa Hutchinson—issued a statement on behalf of its entire membership. It reads in part:</td>

His office declined to pursue more than 700 cases.<br />Top Justice Department officials in Washington, meanwhile, urged federal prosecutors to be aggressive in bringing a full slate of federal charges, even suggesting they consider sedition, or plotting to overthrow the U.S. government, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. A review of protest-related cases show no such charges have been filed.</td>

After outbreaks in multiple Chinese cities in recent months including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and elsewhere, authorities pointed to frozen-food packaging as the potential origin.<br />While infectious disease experts say cold surfaces can be vectors for virus transmission, the WHO and other health authorities say the risk of infection from food or its packaging is thought to be low.<br />On Tuesday, a Chinese diplomat based in India posted a story about the possibility of cold-chain transmission on Twitter while calling for further investigation into an unsubstantiated fringe theory that the U.S. military was involved in spreading the virus.</td>

Investors sent its shares surging 42% Tuesday morning following the report.<br />That reaction is likely less a reflection of the quarter itself—revenue growth of 10% was a far cry from the 21% pace Stitch Fix posted for the comparable period last year—and more the expectation that record client growth will pay off later. It likely also was exaggerated by very high short interest in the stock heading into earnings. The company still has to show that it can improve margins.<br />Stitch Fix, which offers algorithmically personalized clothing with the help of a stylist, for years has been asking new clients to ditch decade-old habits of trying clothing on in a store before paying for it. For the first several months of the pandemic, it seemed this was too big of an ask for many shoppers. Stitch Fix’s sales in the quarter ended Aug. 1 grew just 3% from a year earlier after falling by more than 9% in the prior period.<br />But the company’s latest results suggest that many more consumers are coming around, and it is happening just as a window of opportunity is about to close: When more shoppers feel comfortable visiting shopping malls as Covid-19 cases recede, Stitch Fix might have hooked customers for good.</td>

It continued trading its employees’ own money.<br />The SEC said BlueCrest created the proprietary fund, BSMA Limited, in 2011 and moved a majority of its best traders to work on it.

The company raised the same amount of money through a similar program it rolled out in September.<br />Tesla’s share price is more than nine times higher than it was a year ago after adjusting for a recent stock split, as the company has been able to improve its liquidity and keep its streak of profitable quarters going—now up to five—amid the coronavirus pandemic. Last month, S&P Dow Jones Indices said Tesla would be added to the S&P 500 index in December, boosting the stock’s mainstream appeal.<br />The fundraising coincides with significant investments in the company’s production capacity.

      <td>In a sign of investors’ meager appetite for driverless-car ventures,  Uber Technologies Inc.  isn’t so much selling its ill-fated project as paying a rival to take it on.<br />The ride-hailing giant said late Monday that its autonomous-driving unit ATG would be acquired by Aurora Innovation Inc., a startup with about half the staff. But this is no usual acquisition: Aurora isn’t handing over cash; in fact, it gets $400 million of extra capital from Uber as part of the deal.<br />For the ride-hailing giant, the appeal of the transaction is that it takes driverless cars off its balance sheet. It owned roughly 86% of ATG at the end of September, having sold small stakes to Toyota, its parts supplier  Denso  and to Japanese tech investor SoftBank last year at a valuation of $7.25 billion. After the deal with Aurora, it will only own about 26% of the venture, while the ATG minorities will own a further 14%.<br />Crucially, that means Uber, which is under pressure to trim losses, won’t have to consolidate the significant expense of developing driverless cars in its accounts. The deal also draws a line under an endeavor that gave the company endless public-relations grief: In 2017, Alphabet’s rival business Waymosued Uber for stealing trade secrets, and a year later one of Uber’s test vehicles killed a pedestrian.<br />Still, Aurora is the more obvious winner. The company has the credibility of being founded in 2017 by three veterans of the driverless-car industry, but was looking isolated after most big car makers found other startups to work with. Now it has Uber, Toyota and Denso as minority investors, all three among the largest players in their different fields.</td>

      <td>Direct payments to households aren’t included in the current $900 billion framework but could resurface</td>
      <td>While Democratic and Republican lawmakers have expressed new optimism that they will reach a coronavirus aid deal, the current round of talks excludes a second round of stimulus checks for households. Here is the latest on the negotiations, and a look at whether checks could still be on the table.<br />A bipartisan group of lawmakers has been working for weeks on a $908 billion package of coronavirus aid, much of which has been agreed upon. But lawmakers are still in negotiations over how to work out the two thorniest components: funding for state and local aid and what sort of legal protections to provide businesses, schools and other entities operating during the pandemic. Lawmakers have said they hope to finalize an agreement and turn it into legislative text in the next couple of days. Congressional leaders have been involved in the discussions, but could play a larger role in coming days.<br />The current bipartisan proposal includes enhanced jobless aid, but doesn’t include funding for another round of direct payments that would reach most households. Including payments similar to the $1,200-plus checks in the spring would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and Republicans have been clear that $900 billion is already more than they would like to spend. Many Republicans are terming this round of talks an emergency aid package, rather than a stimulus plan.<br />It’s not out of the question yet. Democrats and a few Republicans are still pushing to add a second round of stimulus checks into any agreement this year. And before the election, President Trump repeatedly urged Congress to send him additional coronavirus aid that included another round of direct checks. Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) said Monday he had urged Mr. Trump to veto any bill that didn’t include them. And many Democrats are still hoping to see them included.<br />“Direct checks are an excellent way to get money into the hands of people who desperately need it,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said.</td>

      <td>Food-delivery company DoorDash Inc. is set to go public this week, valued at more than $30 billion. Here is a look at how the San Francisco-based startup has leapfrogged rivals to become the dominant player in a competitive market.<br />DoorDash has benefited from an increase in ordering from home during the coronavirus pandemic and its prescient bet on the suburbs. The company commanded nearly half of the U.S. food-delivery market as of mid-October, up from one-third a year earlier.<br />Food-delivery companies started with largely separate geographic strongholds but increasingly began to eat into each other’s markets in recent years, wooing big restaurants with sweetheart deals and customers with deep discounts.<br />DoorDash’s strategy had been to expand into the suburbs as its rivals were focused on big cities. But the startup has pulled ahead of competitors in some big cities, too.<br />With little competition in the suburbs, DoorDash earned big bucks from families placing large orders. It also gave priority to expanding the number of restaurants on its app, while  Uber Technologies Inc.’s  Eats focused on restaurants with fast delivery.</td>

If earlier measures are a guide, the effect will be mostly symbolic.<br />The U.S. announced sanctions Monday against more than half of China’s 25-member top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, that officials in Washington said was central to China’s efforts to rein in freedoms in Hong Kong. The body has imposed a national security law and barred opposition legislators in recent months.<br />Hours after the U.S. move, Hong Kong police arrested eight activists, including opposition legislators and protest organizers, in dawn raids across the city, the latest in a series of arrests of prominent figures accused of crimes over their roles in last year’s antigovernment uprising. Pro-democracy groups say efforts to crush opposition in the city are increasing, despite the rising international condemnation of China.<br />“The Chinese will view the designations of 14 NPC officials as an irritant, but not consequential,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. “Beijing has already made the decision to impose its rule over Hong Kong. Such symbolic steps are unlikely to affect its actions.”<br />China expressed anger over the sanctions, with its foreign ministry Tuesday summoning Robert W. Forden, the U.S. chargé d’affaires in Beijing, to condemn the measures. A ministry spokeswoman told a regular briefing that it firmly opposed U.S. interference and said it wouldn’t affect China’s Hong Kong policies.</td>

      <td>As the Internet-of-Things proliferates, consumers want to know how their data will be used by the makers of devices—before they buy them</td>
      <td>Your milk and orange juice have nutrition labels. Soon your refrigerator and coffee maker could, too.<br />For years, consumer privacy advocates have pushed the idea of so-called nutrition labels for devices. Instead of telling consumers how much vitamin B or C a product has, these labels would tell the prospective purchasers how their data will be used and by whom.<br />Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab Security and Privacy Institute are floating a working prototype of how such a label could look. They’re providing their label—vetted by researchers and numerous privacy experts—free of charge to Internet-of-Things, or IoT, device makers, standards organizations and others. Discussions for adoption are still in the early stages. But advocates hope device makers will adopt this type of label, or that organizations such as Underwriters Laboratories, an independent safety-testing and certification company, or Consumer Reports will use at least portions of the label in their review processes, says Lorrie Cranor, the director and Bosch distinguished professor in security and privacy technologies at CyLab.<br />The label is designed to go on a product’s packaging or on the websites where the devices are sold. Products under consideration for carrying the label could include any smart device that is connected to the internet—including security cameras, refrigerators, speakers, home controllers, doorbells, toothbrushes, thermostats, light switches, smart plugs and much more, says Dr. Cranor, who is also a professor of computer science and a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon.<br />The idea of protecting data privacy becomes more of an issue as more products connect to the internet. On Dec. 8,  Apple Inc.  began requiring app developers to provide information about their applications’ privacy practices before submitting new apps and app updates to the App Store. What’s more, consumer organizations are increasingly incorporating data privacy into their ratings, while some states have enacted, or are considering, privacy legislation. The Federal Trade Commission, which also has raised the concept of a nutrition label for privacy, says it continues to support the efforts of industry groups in this area.</td>

These included “reduction in the risk of confirmed Covid-19 occurring at least seven days after Dose 2.” The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses for full protection.<br />In addition, the FDA said another benefit was reduction in the risk of confirmed Covid-19 after the first dose and before the second dose. Another clear benefit, the agency said, was “reduction in the risk of confirmed severe Covid-19 any time after dose 1.”<br />The reference to reduction in confirmed severe disease was important, as early critics of some of the vaccine trials were concerned that only mild to moderate disease was prevented.</td>

      <td>Advancing Women Artists was founded by the late pioneering philanthropist known as ‘Indiana Jane’; the closure comes as a surprise</td>
      <td>FLORENCE—Advancing Women Artists, the nonprofit devoted to rescuing the forgotten works of female artists and founded by the late pioneering philanthropist Jane Fortune, is folding. A message sent to AWA members on Dec. 1 and posted to its website said: “In June 2021, our much-loved organization will officially close its doors.”<br />Since its foundation in 2009, AWA has identified hundreds of works created by Italian women artists between the 16th and 20th centuries and financed the restoration of 70. Last year, the organization attracted world-wide attention with the unveiling of perhaps the most ambitious work known to have been painted by a woman during the Italian Renaissance: Plautilla Nelli’s Last Supper.<br />Many of the canvasses located by AWA were found, caked with grime, in dusty museum storerooms and dank Tuscan churches. The organization’s work earned Ms. Fortune the nickname in Italy of “Indiana Jane”—an allusion both to her native state and the intrepid fictional treasure hunter, Indiana Jones.<br />Ironically, the announcement of AWA’s closure has come at a time of unprecedented interest in women’s art. Twentieth century female artists have achieved record prices in the sale rooms; a work by the British painter Jenny Saville went under the hammer in 2018 for more than $10 million, the highest amount ever paid for a painting by a woman. Last February, Columbia University art historian Michael Cole published a substantial monograph on Sofonisba Anguissola, a 16th century Italian artist. And recently, the National Gallery in London inaugurated a major exhibition devoted to Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi.<br />Last week’s announcement from AWA, which gave no reason for its closure, came as a surprise to many supporters of the organization. The organization’s director, Linda Falcone, said AWA lacked the financial resources to continue with its work and had been unable to find a benefactor to succeed Ms. Fortune, who died in 2018.</td>

      <td>Fitness+, Apple’s new subscription service for on-demand workouts, arrives next week with 21 trainers across 10 disciplines.</td>
      <td>The fact that Apple’s six-country launch of a new connected workout platform, Fitness+, which arrives in the Apple store next week, is happening during a surge in a global pandemic that carved out a new market for home fitness is, Apple insists, pure coincidence (“Siri, what’s a synonym for providential?”)<br />“It does feel like people might think we built Fitness+ because of Covid,” Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of fitness technologies, tells me via a video call from the company’s fitness studio in Los Angeles. “But we’ve been working on it for a very, very long time.”<br />From the Apple Watch’s launch, more than five years ago, Blahnik says “fitness has been a really big part of [its] story.” With the launch of Fitness+, however, Apple aims to create a new ecosystem for the watch: a subscription-based, on-demand virtual-fitness studio, with an initial 21-person team of trainers (recruited after an intensive search, in which Apple says “no gym was too gritty for us to go into”), covering 10 disciplines—from high-intensity interval training to dance workouts to rowing to “mindful cooldowns”—offering a fresh slate of workouts, of varying lengths, every week (all set to the beat of Apple Music).<br />Apple doesn’t make fitness equipment—at least not yet—but the watch, arguably, is fitness equipment. Workouts and activity tracking are, Apple says, among the device’s most popular features. From the get-go, the watch had been making inroads into wearers’ wellness routines, not simply by keeping track of their daily movements but by encouraging them to “close your rings,” or complete three color-coded, adjustable-difficulty tasks: “Stand,” for spending at least a minute moving around every hour for 12 hours; “Move,” for burning a certain number of active calories; and “Exercise,” for doing at least 30 minutes of an activity as or more strenuous than brisk walking. It also offers gentle exhortations to pause for deep-breathing exercises.<br />In its fitness lab, the company has been closely tracking more than a hundred thousand hours of activity—across a range of workouts—all with the goal of improving the watch’s accuracy at discerning, say, what stroke you are employing as you swim laps.</td>

      <td>Getting boys to engage in virtual instruction doesn’t have to be a battle. Experts offer tips on how to make virtual school more bearable.</td>
      <td>We’re nine months into the pandemic and remote school is wearing on students. Boys, who are at greater risk of falling behind academically than girls, are having an especially tough time with all the hours spent behind screens. The challenges of staying focused and motivated in remote school carry even higher stakes for adolescent and teenage boys, who face more academic pressure than younger ones.<br />I reached out to child psychologists and education experts to find out how parents can help their sons—and daughters—remain focused and motivated in virtual school. They all said the first step is for parents to examine their own expectations and reactions to their children’s struggles. Here are some key pieces of advice:<br />“What you need to do as a parent is try to stay away from your own catastrophic thinking and use your foremost consultant, which is your child himself,” said Michael Thompson, a child psychologist and author of “Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys.” He added, “No one knows more about what he likes and what he hates about school than he does.”<br />How do you elicit meaningful feedback from an adolescent or teenager who responds with one-word answers? It’s all about how you ask the question. Dr. Thompson suggests saying something like, “I see you’re struggling with math and English. How can I help you with that?”<br />Experts caution parents against being accusatory. If a teacher has alerted you to missing assignments, you can say to your child, “I heard you’re having a hard time turning things in. What’s happening?” suggests Jeffrey Selman, vice president of clinical services at First Children Services, a behavioral health and special-education services provider for children in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</td>

In a November deal, the Los Angeles-based firm Hackman Capital Partners agreed to invest around £300 million (about $401 million) in a facility to be known as Eastbrook Studios, located about 14 miles east of central London. Work on the project is slated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 and be completed 18 to 24 months later.<br />“Content is a growth business, people are consuming more programming than ever before,” said Chief Executive Michael Hackman.<br />HCP  recently led a group of investors in a deal to acquire the New York studios where “The Sopranos,” “30 Rock” and “Sex and the City” were filmed. Mr. Hackman said he is also bullish on London.</td>

A number of recent Dutch narcotics raids have snagged Mexican nationals, including ones linked to the violent Jalisco New Generation Cartel, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.<br />Mexican cartels, which dominate drug trafficking in North America, are drawn to the Netherlands because it is a global trade nexus with sea and rail links to Asia that has long been Europe’s top manufacturer of synthetic drugs.<br />Piggybacking legitimate commercial channels, Mexican cartels are combining sophistication with ruthlessness to expand their reach world-wide. Their multinational drive is enabled by the advent over recent decades of highly potent synthetic drugs that don’t rely on crops or farmers and can be manufactured in compact facilities almost anywhere. Production experts instant-message instructions to overseas workers and hop the globe like factory troubleshooters in any industry.<br />With the U.S. drug market saturated and methamphetamine labs in Mexico already supersize, cartels that murder for market share see Europe as a new hub.

In contrast, triple-A coupon rates dipped to 4.09%.

More than a third of the total was made up of commercial paper, short-term debt that comes due in less than a year.<br />Chang Li, a Beijing-based director at S&P Global Ratings, said borrowing costs have risen in particular for companies in northeastern and western provinces where local governments have limited financial resources. Costs have also risen in industries burdened by overcapacity, he said. That would likely include companies specializing in areas such as mining, chemical production and heavy industry.</td>

People familiar with the matter said Sunday that the company plans to boost the proposed price range to $56 to $60 a share.<br />Airbnb set the initial price range after gauging initial demand from prospective investors.

      <td>Requirement to prove immunity raises practical and ethical issues: Should vaccinated people have greater freedom?</td>
      <td>As the West’s first authorized Covid-19 shots were administered in the U.K., an old ethical question in public health is gaining new relevance: Is there a case for issuing proof of immunity to people who have been inoculated?<br />The idea is that individuals could stop wearing masks and following social-distancing rules if they can prove they have been inoculated and so aren’t a risk to others. Restaurants, theaters and offices could reopen with confidence by admitting those certified as vaccinated, and international travel could resume. As the vaccinated population increases, normal life could gradually resume.<br />Scientists and public-health experts caution, though, that it is too soon to know whether the vaccines being raced into production will confer true and lasting immunity to infection. Nor is it clear if they will be as effective at preventing transmission as they were at reducing the severity of illness in trials. Such proposals raise ethical and political considerations, too, about whether it is wise or just to divide citizens into new categories based on their vaccination status.<br />This debate over the pros and cons of so-called immunity passports as a tool to combat the pandemic has been rekindled by the U.K.’s decision last week, the first by a Western country, to authorize the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine. Elderly citizens and health-care workers started receiving a shot developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and Germany’s BioNTech SE on Tuesday.<br />The Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency are evaluating the vaccine as well as several others and, if cleared, vaccinations in the U.S. and the European Union could begin late this year or early in 2021, health officials in both jurisdictions say.</td>

But stimulus from central banks and governments globally has sent fresh cash into funds that buy non-performing loans, reinvigorating the efforts.<br />“Many of the investors are in the process of fund raising or have raised additional funds for what they see as a wave of opportunity,” said Alok Gahrotra, a partner in the portfolio lead advisory team at Deloitte that advises NPL buyers and sellers. “There’s a lot of dry powder to deploy.”<br />In late November,  Alpha Bank ,  one of Greece’s  four dominant lenders, said it was in the final stages of selling a €10.8 billion gross loan portfolio—the equivalent of $12 billion—along with its loan-servicing unit. The preferred bidder is U.S. investment firm Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, which beat out Pacific Investment Management Co. and others for what would be the largest-ever NPL sale in the country. Two more big banks,  National Bank of Greece  and  Piraeus Bank ,  each aim to sell around €7 billion in loans next year.<br />The three transactions will tap a new state-supported securitization program called Hercules, which was first used by Eurobank SA in June to dispose of €7.5 billion gross loans, “paving the way for its peers,” said Eurobank chief executive Fokion Karavias.</td>

It has come as the city closes out its best year for listing activity in a decade—thanks both to IPOs and to secondary listings of companies whose stock already trades on other exchanges, such as JD Health’s parent, the e-commerce group  JD.com Inc.<br />JD Health stock closed 56% higher at 110 Hong Kong dollars a share, the equivalent of $14.19, giving the company a market value of about $44 billion, after earlier rising as much as 76%. Rival Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd., which is controlled by internet giant  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , has a market value of about $41 billion.<br />Individual investors placed orders for more than 420 times the stock offered to them, while institutional buyers sought more than 31 times the shares they were offered, JD Health said. The company operates China’s largest online retail pharmacy, as well as providing other health-care services.<br />Including JD Health, more than 130 companies have raised nearly $47 billion through IPOs and secondary listings in Hong Kong this year, according to Refinitiv. That is the highest total since 2010, even though Ant Group Co.’s blockbuster IPO was derailed in November.

      <td>China’s household debt ballooned in the first half of the year, rising by about $380 billion, according to new Bank for International Settlements data. That increase was almost four times as large as the second-place U.S. And it compounds one of China’s biggest economic vulnerabilities.<br />It has been widely reported that China’s industrial production and exports have helped to power its recovery this year. But the other leg of the recovery is the continued rapid rise of real-estate investment, which is set to outstrip GDP growth again in 2020, as it has in 16 of the past 17 years.<br />Interest rates this year fell sharply in most countries, but the People’s Bank of China has resisted this trend. That means that whereas borrowers in the U.S. were at least able to refinance real-estate loans, Chinese borrowers are left with largely unchanged debt-servicing costs.<br />The reluctance to cut rates reflects the government’s concerns about previous rounds of let-it-rip credit growth, which have left the housing market displaying telltale signs of rampant speculation.<br />Hundreds of millions of units, equivalent to about a fifth of the urban housing stock, are estimated to be vacant. The rental market is still underdeveloped, but where it does exist, yields are typically well below those offered by government bonds. Banks that once lent primarily to industry have recorded ever-growing mortgage books. That already appears to be eating into China’s economic potential, as funding is redirected toward real estate and away from more productive uses.</td>

President-elect Joe Biden received nearly 81 million votes, a record.<br />“They wanted a political leader in the president who would stand up for America, who would express a proud, deep and abiding love for our country, and who would not give in to the radical, politically correct liberals,” he said.<br />Mr. Cotton, who was speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit, provided a contrast to other Republicans who agreed that Mr. Trump’s coalition had proved durable but said that Mr. Trump’s popularity was an indicator of the appeal of his rhetoric and not his policies.<br />“Let’s not kid ourselves,” said William Kristol, who served as chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle during the George H.W. Bush administration from 1989 to 1993. “The demagoguery was what people liked.”</td>

Re-entering that agreement, which would mean lifting sanctions worth billions of dollars to Tehran, would lay the groundwork for a “follow-on negotiation” on broader issues, he said.<br />Mr. Sullivan, who hasn’t spoken publicly much since being named national security adviser, spoke to the CEO Council on Iran and a range of other national security and foreign-policy issues likely to confront the Biden administration.  He discussed reforming international institutions and strengthening ties with allies while confronting adversaries and global competitors like China. But all those efforts would be predicated on a strong domestic policy that focused on American workers to be competitive, he said.</td>

      <td>WELLINGTON, New Zealand—Months before Brenton Tarrantmurdered 51 worshipers at two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch, he sought help from hospital staff for wounds to his right eye and thigh from a firearm incident.<br />A jammed cartridge had exploded while Tarrant was cleaning a rifle in July 2018 at his rented home. Medical staff who treated the now 30-year-old Australian considered the accident to be unusual, but held back from reporting it to police because Tarrant wasn’t behaving aggressively and didn’t appear suicidal.<br />It was just one of several missed opportunities to intercept Tarrant before he gunned down the worshipers on March 15, 2019, that were outlined in an official inquiry into the massacre. The investigation also highlighted police failings in granting Tarrant a firearms license and intelligence agencies’ almost exclusive focus on Islamic extremists.<br />New Zealand banned semiautomatic weapons after the massacre—the deadliest peacetime shooting in New Zealand. Tarrant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in August, the first time New Zealand had imposed a punishment denying any chance of release.<br />Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Tuesday apologized to New Zealand Muslims and said the government would implement all of the inquiry’s recommendations, including the establishment of a new national intelligence agency and an overhaul of counterterrorism methods.</td>

Austin’s nomination would represent the second time a retired general has been chosen to lead the department in recent years, after retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis. In addition to Senate confirmation, Gen. Austin would be required under law to obtain a congressional waiver to serve in the post, as he has been out of uniform for less than seven years.<br />Gen. Austin didn’t respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Biden’s transition team didn’t respond to questions. Mr. Biden told reporters Monday that he planned to name a defense secretary nominee on Friday. Politico reported earlier that Mr. Biden was expected to choose the retired general.<br />Gen. Austin was chosen over at least two other nominees who were considered leading candidates for the post—Michèle Flournoy, who served as a top Pentagon official during the Obama administration, and Jeh Johnson, former Homeland Security secretary and onetime Pentagon general counsel.<br />Both Ms. Flournoy and Mr. Johnson came under criticism from some progressive groups within the Democratic Party, some of whom favored Gen. Austin because of his cautious approach to U.S. force deployment and his experience supervising the withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq in 2011.</td>

Inoculations in Canada could begin shortly afterward, the Canadian leader told attendees of The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit on Monday night.<br />“Our regulator says chances look pretty good that they are going to come to a decision this week,” Mr. Trudeau said, adding Canadian officials are conferring with the Food and Drug Administration and European drug watchdogs.<br />His remarks to the summit offered a defense of Canada’s decision to deploy an aggressive fiscal policy to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Canada has recorded the largest budget-balance deterioration this year among the Group of 20 because of its fiscal response, International Monetary Fund data indicate. Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government also plans to spend an additional 100 billion Canadian dollars, or the equivalent of $78 billion, over the next three years to fortify the recovery.<br />Mr. Trudeau also reflected on Canada’s deteriorating relationship with China, in part over his country’s role in detaining Huawei Technologies Co.

The judge in that suit, Wendy Beetlestone, blocked the restrictions on Oct. 30.<br />The Commerce Department had been set on Nov. 12 to restrict U.S. companies from conducting transactions with TikTok, including hosting the company’s data and delivering the company’s content, which would have essentially made the app inoperable in the U.S.</td>

      <td>Lawyers for the two countries say Jewish heirs’ Holocaust-era claims have no place in U.S. courts</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Germany and Hungary appeared before the Supreme Court on Monday, asking the justices to bar Holocaust-era victims from seeking compensation in U.S. courts for property allegedly confiscated by the Nazi government and its allied regime in Budapest.<br />The cases are separate, involving different  procedural arguments over distinct forms of property. Germany is defending the 1935 acquisition of the Welfenschatz or Guelph Treasure, a trove of medieval religious artifacts held by a Berlin museum, while Hungary is opposing claims against the state railway MAV for items seized from Jews transported to death camps.<br />But both cases boil down to this: The former Axis nations contend that these claims should be resolved through the German and Hungarian legal systems rather than U.S. federal courts. In general, foreign governments can’t be sued in U.S. courts, but there are exceptions for certain types of claims, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that both cases could proceed.<br />In the German case, the D.C. Circuit found the claim fell under an exception allowing suits for expropriation of property in violation of international law. The plaintiffs—heirs and successors of Jewish art dealers who claim they were coerced into selling the artifacts—contend that property confiscation was an element of the Nazis’ genocidal policies and therefore violated international law.<br />Jonathan Freiman, a New Haven, Conn., lawyer representing Germany, told the justices that the plaintiffs were trying to use the Holocaust as “a jurisdictional hook” for a property claim that couldn’t otherwise be heard, as international law doesn’t prohibit states from confiscations within their own borders.</td>

Lawmakers held hourslong phone calls over the weekend and said they came closer to a final agreement on many elements. They are still, however, hashing out the two most contentious portions: the liability protections, long a top GOP priority; and funding for state and local governments, sought by Democrats.<br />“There are still some issues that are outstanding and it’s no secret generally speaking state and local and liability have always been the difficult issues,” said Rep. Tom Reed (R., N.Y.), co-chairman of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of 50 House lawmakers, which endorsed the $908 billion proposal. “That’s where we stand right now. I think we can get there.”<br />Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) said the two issues were essentially paired together to satisfy each party’s demands.<br />“It’s clear that Democrats want additional state and local money and Republicans by and large are asking for some common-sense liability provisions and those are coupled together,” he said.</td>

Uber said it would hold a roughly 26% stake in Aurora on completion of the deal. Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi also is joining the company’s board of directors.<br />Mr. Khosrowshahi has moved to restructure Uber to deliver on a promise to make the company profitable, scaling back many of its expensive side businesses—spanning from electric bikes to flying cars—that haven’t gained much traction. Uber has wound down its product incubator and artificial-intelligence lab, exited e-bikes and sold a stake in its loss-making freight-hauling unit. The company has promised to be profitable on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the end of next year.<br />Uber said ATG, combined with other technology programs, lost $104 million in the third quarter on $25 million in revenue.<br />Aurora is led by autonomous-driving pioneer Chris Urmson, who helped launch Google’s autonomous-driving project. The acquisition bolsters Aurora’s position in an industry that has suffered under numerous technical setbacks.</td>

It also includes items related to anti-money-laundering efforts, cybersecurity, overseas military commitments, Space Force and the U.S. border wall.<br />In July, a Senate version of the bill passed 86-14, and the House version passed 295-125, more than the two-thirds supermajority needed to override a potential veto. Now, lawmakers are planning to vote on a compromise version and send it to the president’s desk.<br />The president has threatened to veto the NDAA for two reasons.</td>

      <td>Republicans should insist on using the $429 billion in Fed funds.</td>
      <td>Both parties in Washington seem intent on passing another Covid relief bill this month, but it matters what’s in it and especially how it’s paid for. Republicans above all need to repurpose the unused funds from the Treasury backstop for the Federal Reserve’s 13(3) pandemic lending facilities.<br />The two sides are focusing on something close to $900 billion, which is much more than needed given the imminent arrival of Covid-19 vaccines. But at least that’s down from the Chuck Schumer-Nancy Pelosi demand of $2.2 trillion. The Speaker last week came off that attempt at political extortion, proving that it had been a gambit to prevent a deal before the election.<br />The Speaker figured the lack of a deal would hurt the GOP, and she even refused President Trump’s pre-election offer of $1.8 trillion. She got too politically greedy. Voters decided to slash her credit-card limit by reducing her House majority and giving the GOP a chance to keep its Senate majority in the two Georgia runoffs on Jan. 5.<br />Senate Republicans have offered a bill for somewhere north of $500 billion that would be an ample bridge to the vaccine. It would extend jobless benefits for gig workers not covered by regular unemployment benefits. It would provide a second round of paycheck protection loans for small businesses hurt by shutdowns. And it includes tens of billions for Covid-related health care such as building stockpiles of medical supplies, as well as $31 billion for vaccines and therapeutics.<br />Even better is what it leaves out. There’s no repeat of the $1,200 checks to most Americans, most of whom never lost their job or are re-employed. There’s also no direct aid for profligate states, though the states would benefit from the other payments, including for child care and schools. No doubt Democrats will demand more in negotiations, most of which is intended to help the public unions that run Illinois, New York and California.</td>

      <td>One question hanging over the looming Biden Administration is whether its principals have learned from any of President Trump’s successes. Consider climate-envoy-to-be John Kerry’s Middle East views four years ago, shortly after Mr. Trump’s 2016 victory. Speaking at the Brookings Institution, Mr. Kerry, then Secretary of State, insisted that Palestinian peace was a precondition for Israel to make peace with its Arab neighbors.<br />“There will be no separate peace between Israel and the Arab world. I want to make that very clear to all of you,” Mr. Kerry said. “I’ve heard several prominent politicians in Israel sometimes saying, well, the Arab world’s in a different place now, and we just have to reach out to them and we can work some things with the Arab world, and we’ll deal with the Palestinians. No. No, no and no.”<br />He repeated: “There will be no advance and separate peace with the Arab world without the Palestinian process and Palestinian peace. Everybody needs to understand that. That is a hard reality.”<br />Well, this year the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan agreed in U.S.-brokered negotiations to normalize relations with Israel without a resolution in the Palestinian conflict. The Abraham Accords were achieved more or less by reversing team Obama’s Mideast policy, and closer Arab-Israeli cooperation puts the U.S. on a firmer regional footing.<br />Everyone makes mistakes, and Mr. Kerry was reflecting the consensus of professional Washington and the Mideast peace industry. Yet the deals show that hard power and shared interests matter more in world politics than center-left sentimentality. Israel and Sunni Arab states have a common threat in Iran and can benefit from mutual investment. Let’s hope the Biden Administration doesn’t throw away this progress.</td>

Progressives are ecstatic, but Mr. Becerra’s views and lack of health-care experience are cause for close Senate confirmation scrutiny.<br />The Democratic identity politics crowd has been clamoring for Mr. Biden to appoint another Hispanic to his cabinet in addition to Alejandro Mayorkas at Homeland Security. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo had been a top contender for HHS, but she was vetoed by progressives as too white, too moderate and apparently also too qualified.<br />Mr. Becerra is none of those.

In Congress he was a staunch progressive, co-sponsoring Medicare for All bills before the idea was in Democratic fashion.<br />He signed a letter in 2016 urging the Obama HHS to use “march-in rights” to invalidate drug-maker patents for medicines whose research was partly government funded. This could encompass most drugs. Earlier this year he pushed the Trump Administration to confiscate Gilead’s patent for its Covid antiviral remdesivir.<br />Mr. Becerra has no expertise in how drug and insurance markets function, let alone experience running a health-care bureaucracy. His apparent primary qualification is that he’s filed 100 some lawsuits against the Trump Administration, though he’s won relatively few and lost on health-care issues. In 2017 Obama-appointed federal Judge Vince Chhabria slapped down his lawsuit against the Trump Administration for ending cost-sharing reduction subsidies that Congress never appropriated and had to give the AG a tutorial in the Affordable Care Act and insurance markets.</td>

      <td>With a majority, Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders would resume cuts to vital military spending.</td>
      <td>The stakes in the Georgia U.S. Senate races on Jan. 5, 2021, between Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler and their respective challengers, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, are very high for a host of reasons. One that has not received enough attention is the readiness of our military. The U.S. faces rising threats from China, Russia and Iran, and continued robust funding of our military is clearly at stake in Georgia, which will decide the Senate majority. Nowhere is the divide between Democrats and Republicans more important.<br />For decades the Democratic Party has staked out a position of diminishing the importance of U.S. military readiness. President Jimmy Carter slashed defense spending in the first three years of his term. This created a hollow force, only to have the Soviets and Iranians take advantage of America’s weakened presence in the Middle East, which forced Mr. Carter to increase spending at the end of his term. President Bill Clinton cut the size of the military by a third, reversing a decade of progress under the Reagan and first Bush administrations.<br />More recently, Barack Obama and Joe Biden oversaw a 25% reduction in the military budget during their second term. The cuts were more than numbers—they dramatically undermined our military’s combat readiness and the morale of our troops.<br />In 2015, only three of the Army’s 58 brigade combat teams—the 5,000-strong deployable units in the Army—were combat-ready and capable of completing their missions. Less than half of the Navy’s and Marine Corps’ aviation fleets were flight-ready, and only half of the Navy’s amphibious ships were available to support contingency operations. The circumstances in late 2016 and early 2017 were so dire that the Army publicly expressed concerns about running out of bullets.<br />A main reason Mr. Perdue and I first ran for office in 2014 was to reverse these reckless cuts to our military. We were part of the class of 12 freshman who ushered in Republican control of the Senate and later worked closely with President Trump to give priority to the rebuilding of our military, its morale and readiness. We have made historic progress.</td>

      <td>CEO Douglas Yearley says housing market is strongest he has seen in 30 years at company</td>
      <td>Toll Brothers Inc.’s  sales rose in the latest quarter, fueled by low borrowing costs and shifting living preferences driven by the pandemic.<br />The luxury home builder said it generated $2.55 billion in sales, a 7% increase from a year ago and ahead of analysts’ projections of $2.08 billion, according to FactSet. Revenue from home sales, which represents a majority of the company’s total revenue, rose about 9% to $2.5 billion.<br />“We are currently experiencing the strongest housing market I have seen in my 30 years at Toll Brothers, and we continue to increase prices in nearly all of our communities,” Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said in prepared remarks.<br />The number of contracts for new homes increased 68% to 3,407 units from last year, while contract value rose 63% to $2.74 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31.<br />The U.S. housing market has gotten a boost from pandemic trends as many have left large cities in search of bigger homes in less crowded areas where they can work remotely and enjoy more space.</td>

      <td>They’ve called me ‘reckless’ and a ‘denier,’ but our numbers are much better than those of Illinois, New Jersey and New York.</td>
      <td>Pierre, S.D.<br />In the coming weeks, governors across the country will give speeches outlining their budget proposals. Following months of economic lockdowns, sheltering in place, and huge numbers of businesses being forced to close permanently, many of my peers are likely not looking forward to these addresses. Some will propose tax increases. Others will take on more debt, and a few will be forced to make significant budget cuts. In South Dakota, as we have done throughout this pandemic, we will forge a different path.<br />Rather than following the pack and mandating harsh rules, South Dakota provides our residents with information about what is happening on the ground in our state—the science, facts and data. Then, we ask all South Dakotans to take personal responsibility for their health, the health of their loved ones, and—in turn—the health of our communities. The state hasn’t issued lockdowns or mask mandates. We haven’t shut down businesses or closed churches. In fact, our state has never even defined what an “essential business” is. That isn’t the government’s role.<br />Since March, many of my peers have attempted to stop the spread of the virus without considering their citizens’ social or mental well-being or the state of their economies. Even amid a pandemic, public policy ought to be holistic. Daily needs must still be met. People need to eat and keep a roof over their heads. And they still need purpose. That means policy makers cannot have tunnel vision. They must balance public-health concerns with people’s mental and emotional needs, their economic livelihoods and social connections, and liberty, among many other important factors.<br />Many in the media have criticized this approach, labeling me ill-informed, reckless and even a “denier.” Some have asserted that South Dakota is “as bad as it gets anywhere in the world” when it comes to Covid-19—a demonstrably false statement. At the same time, my critics praise states that issued lockdowns, mandated masks and shut down businesses—lauding these states as having taken the “right” steps to mitigate the spread of the virus.</td>

      <td>It doesn’t promote public health when media and tech companies stifle scientific debate.</td>
      <td>Information has never been more plentiful or easier to distribute. Yet we are sliding into a new age of censorship and suppression, encouraged by technology giants and traditional media companies. As someone who’s been falsely characterized as a coronavirus “denier,” I have seen this crisis firsthand.<br />Since June,  Amazon  has twice tried to suppress self-published booklets I have written about Covid-19 and the response to it. These booklets don’t contain conspiracy theories. Like the scientists who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration, I simply believe many measures to control the coronavirus have been damaging, counterproductive and unsupported by science.<br />Amazon has said earlier that “as a bookseller, we believe that providing access to the written word is important, including books that some may find objectionable.” The company sells “Mein Kampf” and “The Anarchist’s Cookbook.” But when it comes to Covid, Amazon has a different standard. At least half a dozen other authors have emailed me that their books have been pulled. Amazon won’t disclose how many, or other details about how it picks books to censor.<br />Google-owned YouTube censors even more aggressively. The company disclosed in October that it had pulled more than 200,000 videos about the epidemic—including one from Scott Atlas, a physician who was advising President Trump.  Facebook  has not only censored videos and attached warning labels or “fact checks” to news articles, but removed groups that oppose lockdowns and other restrictions.<br />That online entertainment and retail companies have benefited financially from lockdowns adds to the ugliness of their suppression efforts. Interestingly,  Apple —whose mobile business means it gains less than other big tech companies—has been less aggressive.</td>
