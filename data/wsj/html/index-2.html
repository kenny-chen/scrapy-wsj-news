      <td>After-tax incomes for bottom 20% of households would rise by 20% under plan moving through House committees</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Congressional Democrats are using coronavirus relief legislation to advance a vision of federal aid to households that is focused on cash assistance with few restrictions, moving away from the work requirements and minimum-income thresholds that have been cornerstones of federal policies for decades.<br />The bill’s $1,400 per-person direct payments, expansion of the child tax credit and extension of unemployment insurance all would provide flexible cash to households. Democrats have emphasized the breadth of households’ needs during the pandemic and have rejected Republicans’ concerns that giving people money would discourage them from returning to work.<br />For lower-income and middle-income households, the combination of policies in the Democrats’ legislation could yield significant short-term increases in income. While unemployment benefits have an application process and eligibility restrictions, direct payments and the child tax credit expansion would have no strings attached, and they are available even to households with no income.<br />The bottom 20% of households by income would see their after-tax incomes rise by 20% because of the plan’s direct payments and tax credit expansions, according to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. That group would get an average benefit of $2,810, while the middle 20% of households would get an average of $3,360, or 5.5% of after-tax income.<br />Higher-income households would get smaller amounts, and for now, Democrats are waiting before advancing the tax increases on top earners they promised during last year’s campaign.</td>

The company’s North America beverage sales volume fell by 1.5% in 2020 and was flat in the fourth quarter.</td>

      <td>New federally mandated disclosures by California’s Sutter Health illustrate the wide disparity in healthcare rates negotiated by insurers</td>
      <td>When a woman gets a caesarean section at the gleaming new Van Ness location of Sutter Health’s California Pacific Medical Center, the price might be $6,241. Or $29,257. Or $38,264. It could even go as high as $60,584.<br />The rate the hospital charges depends on the insurance plan covering the birth. At the bottom end of the scale is a local health plan that serves largely Medicaid recipients. At the top are prices for women whose plans don’t have the San Francisco hospital in their insurers’ network.<br />The nation’s roughly 6,000 hospitals have begun to reveal the secret rates they negotiate with insurers for a range of procedures. The data offer the first full look inside the confidential deals that set healthcare rates for insurers and employers covering more than 175 million Americans. The submissions also illuminate how widely prices vary—even for the same procedure, performed in the same facility—depending on who is paying.<br />“It is shining a light on the insanity of U.S. healthcare pricing,” said Niall Brennan, chief executive of the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes medical costs. “It’s at the center of the affordability crisis in American healthcare.”<br />Under a Trump administration rule that took effect in January, nearly all hospitals must make their prices public, a move the industry sued to block. Courts rejected hospitals’ arguments that their prices should remain under wraps. Healthcare economists say these rates are a major driver of U.S. medical costs, the highest in the world, and they are largely paid by American companies and workers.</td>

      <td>Even before Gen. Min Aung Hlaing wrested control, the U.S. had slapped sanctions on him, and his army’s campaigns are the subject of a genocide case</td>
      <td>SINGAPORE—On the fifth day after Myanmar’s military chief seized power in a coup, his new foreign minister invited the diplomatic corps for a briefing via Zoom, the videoconferencing app. For Western officials, this presented a problem: Would attendance signal that they were in any way recognizing Gen. Min Aung Hlaing’s rule?<br />A flurry of discussions followed. In the end, many, including the U.S., sent deputies rather than ambassadors. Some kept their cameras off. Others expressed condemnation of the takeover, according to four diplomats with knowledge of the meeting.<br />“It was a statement—not to be there in any way to give the impression that this was OK, or that we were OK with the coup,” one of the diplomats said. “On the other hand, we want to keep diplomatic channels open.”<br />The episode captures the dilemma many in the international community face over if and how to engage with the regime of Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who last week ended Myanmar’s decadelong transition to democracy. Even before he wrested absolute control, Washington had slapped sanctions on him over alleged human-rights abuses, and his army’s brutal campaigns became the subject of a continuing genocide case at the U.N.’s top court.<br />Since the Feb. 1 coup, a number of foreign governments have tried to get him to back down. On Wednesday, President Biden said the U.S. would impose fresh sanctions against the military leadership. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke this week with officials from India and Japan, who have influence in the country, to apply pressure. New Zealand suspended all ties and declared the regime illegitimate.</td>

The Irvine, Calif.-based  Sunstone Hotel Investors Inc.  is among the bidders, say people familiar with the matter.<br />That purchase price would translate into a valuation of more than $2 million a key, which would make it one of the most expensive hotel acquisitions in history.<br />Hotel owners like to measure sales on a price-per-key metric, which enables them to compare properties of different size and room count. The highest valued U.S. hotel transaction ever was the 2018 sale of Edition hotel in Manhattan’s Times Square, which went for nearly $3.4 million a roomkey, according to lodging data tracker STR. Only two other U.S. hotels sold for more than $2 million a key, STR said.</td>

This time, it was former diplomat Michael Kovrig.<br />Since then, the two men have been thrust to the center of a high-stakes standoff between Canada, the U.S. and China, where they have been detained and accused of espionage. Hope had surged recently among family members and supporters that the men might be released if separate talks to resolve criminal charges against Meng Wanzhou, an executive at China’s Huawei Technologies Co., bore fruit. Canada has accused China of detaining the two men in retaliation for Ms. Meng’s arrest on a U.S. extradition request.<br />With both sides digging in on demands too far to bridge, those discussions stalled and are now dormant, according to people familiar with the matter. The Biden administration could revisit the talks in the coming months, the people said, but the timing of any such movement is unclear. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.<br />Vice President Kamala Harris told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on a phone call earlier this month that the U.S. would do everything it could to get the two men released.</td>

      <td>Drugmaker booked $2 million in sales in 2020 from end-of-year shipments of the shot</td>
      <td>LONDON— AstraZeneca  PLC said it was fixing problems with the manufacturing of its Covid-19 vaccine and expects to roughly double monthly production to 200 million doses by April, as it seeks to move past a rocky start to the shot’s rollout.<br />The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker reported strong full-year earnings and forecast increased 2021 earnings growth. The forecast doesn’t factor in sales of the pandemic vaccine it developed alongside the University of Oxford.<br />Like other vaccine makers, AstraZeneca and Oxford are working on new versions of the shot to target existing and emerging variants of the coronavirus. The drugmaker said Thursday it hoped to reach production of an adapted vaccine at scale within six to nine months, using clinical-trial data and manufacturing agreements already in place.<br />Last year, AstraZeneca stumbled in communicating clinical-trial results and more recently, suffered a shortfall in doses pledged to the European Union. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot and other executives said Thursday they were working out production kinks and would meet targets to deliver more than 400 million doses to rich and poor countries in coming months. That follows green lights in the U.K., Europe and beyond for the vaccine’s use, which isn’t approved yet for U.S. use.<br />This week, the World Health Organization recommended the shot for broad global use, including in countries battling a new strain of the coronavirus first detected in South Africa. Limited trial data have suggested the vaccine is less effective against that version of the virus, though its appears to hold up against a fast-spreading variant first seen in the U.K., particularly against severe symptoms.</td>

In time, BNY Mellon will allow those digital assets to pass through the same plumbing used by managers’ other, more traditional holdings—from Treasurys to technology stocks—using a platform that is now in prototype. The bank is already discussing plans with clients to bring their digital currencies into the fold.<br />“Digital assets are becoming part of the mainstream,” said Roman Regelman, chief executive of BNY Mellon’s asset-servicing and digital businesses.<br />It’s a big step for Wall Street’s back-office banks, whose concerns over regulatory, legal and stability risks left them reluctant to come into direct contact with crypto markets. But as prices of bitcoin and other digital assets have continued to rise, they have become more popular with asset managers, hedge funds and other institutional investors.<br />And those firms’ top executives started asking BNY Mellon and their peers to treat digital assets as they would their other holdings, Mr. Regelman said.</td>

      <td>Energy giant joins peers it pledging to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels while tapping the growing electricity market</td>
      <td>LONDON— Royal Dutch Shell  PLC said it would start reducing oil production, calling an end to a decades-old strategy centered on pumping more hydrocarbons as it and other energy giants seek to capitalize on a shift to low-carbon power.<br />Shell said Thursday its oil production had already peaked and it expects output to decline 1-2% a year, including from asset sales, reducing its exposure to commodity prices over the longer term. At the same time, the company said it would double the amount of electricity it sells and roll out thousands of new electric-vehicle charging points.<br />The strategy follows similar plans from rivals  BP  PLC and  Total SE  to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels while expanding in renewable power such as wind and solar, partly in response to growth in regulatory and investor pressure.<br />BP plans to reduce its oil-and-gas output by 40% in the coming decade. Over the same period, Total wants to reduce its sales of oil products such as gasoline and diesel by 30%, while increasing sales of natural gas, electricity and biofuels.<br />However, the pivot is seen by analysts as challenging because it requires investments in areas where major oil companies don’t necessarily have a competitive advantage and that have lower returns. Renewables projects typically generate returns of around 10%, compared with the traditional 15% targeted on oil-and-gas projects.</td>

The practice has long been common in the cryptocurrency market, where traders target an asset that can be easily moved. That behavior has increasingly spilled over into the stock market as millions of individuals, stuck at home over the past year because of the coronavirus pandemic, have turned to day trading through brokerages such as Robinhood Markets Inc.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco leader Mary Daly said the U.S. central bank is unlikely to pull back on its bond-buying stimulus this year, and that another round of government aid shouldn’t overheat the economy.<br />The official said she continues to expect the U.S. economy to pick up speed over the second half of the year, as vaccinations roll out and allow the economy to emerge from the shadows of the coronavirus pandemic. But even as the nation emerges from the crisis, it won’t yet be time for the central bank to pull back on its $120 billion a month in bond buying, she told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.<br />“For now, we have policy in a good place,” Ms. Daly said. “If you take the lens of my modal outlook, then it’s really continuing to purchase at the current pace through the end of this year.”<br />If the economy delivers the robust growth in the second half of the year that most central bankers expect, “then I can see the need to keep the current pace as not being as critical” starting some time next year, she said.<br />Ms. Daly was interviewed ahead of remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed leader also said he sees no reason for the central bank to pull back on aid for the economy, saying the asset purchases are “a key part of what we’re doing in providing overall accommodation to the economy…We’re not thinking about shrinking the balance sheet.”</td>

      <td>Return dates get pushed to September or beyond, keeping firms and employees in ‘moment of limbo’</td>
      <td>The hardest question to answer for American corporations: When should offices reopen?<br />From Silicon Valley to Tennessee to Pennsylvania, high hopes that a rapid vaccine rollout in early 2021 would send millions of workers back into offices by spring have been scuttled. Many companies are pushing workplace return dates to September—and beyond—or refusing to commit to specific dates, telling employees it will be a wait-and-see remote-work year.<br />The delays span industries.  Qurate Retail Inc.,  the parent company of brands such as Ballard Designs, QVC and HSN, recently shifted its planned May return to offices in the Philadelphia area, Atlanta and other cities until September at the earliest. TechnologyAdvice, a marketing firm in Nashville, initially told employees to plan on Feb. 1 as their return date. The company then pushed the date back to August. Now, TA has decided it will begin a hybrid in-office schedule in the fall of 2021, letting workers choose whether to work remotely or come in, the company says.<br />Return-to-office dates have shifted so much in the past year that some companies aren’t sharing them with employees. Shipping giant  United Parcel Service Inc.,  based in Atlanta, and financial-services firm Fidelity Investments Inc., based in Boston, haven’t announced return dates, instead telling workers signing on from home that the companies are monitoring the coronavirus pandemic and will call workers back when it is safe.<br />Nearly a year of makeshift work at home has weighed on employees, leaders say. While many companies say productivity is up, executives worry that creativity is suffering and say that burnout is on the rise. Even so, bosses struggle to say when things will change.</td>

Clubhouse, an audio-only social app featuring conversations with big names in Hollywood, politics and tech, is creating the biggest stir.<br />The app raised $100 million at a $1 billion valuation in January from investors including venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, less than a year after launching. Monthly downloads of the invite-only app jumped to 2.4 million last month from 2,000 in September, according to data provided by app-research firm Sensor Tower Inc.<br />Competition is on its heels. In perhaps the strongest sign of audio social networks’ rising status,  Facebook Inc.  is in the early stages of experimenting with social audio features and  Twitter Inc.  has added a voice feature for tweeting and is testing a separate audio chat-room product, called Spaces, a spokeswoman said. Entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban said he is involved with building an audio-focused social platform, called Fireside, which will compete with Clubhouse. A person familiar with the project said it would launch this year.<br />The new social apps are attracting prominent figures and an array of users, including performers seeking an audience, startup founders in search of mentorship, and videogamers looking for fellow players. They have also drawn users bumped off other platforms for spreading conspiracy theories, politicians drumming up support and pandemic-weary people seeking novel ways to connect amid lockdowns.</td>

      <td>Seventeen Republican senators would need to join all Democrats to convict Trump</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—House impeachment managers on Thursday will continue setting out their case against former President Donald Trump for allegedly inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, an effort aimed at persuading enough Republican senators to convict him.<br />On the third day of the impeachment trial, House Democrats have another eight hours to present evidence. Once the managers finish, Mr. Trump’s legal team will have 16 hours to present his defense.<br />Some Republican senators ended Wednesday concluding that the impeachment managers, through the use of video and audio, had painted a horrifying portrait of the rioters who stormed the Capitol, but many said that they hadn’t shown that the violence was a direct result of Mr. Trump’s rhetoric. If all 50 Democrats vote to convict the former president, 17 Republicans would be needed to join them to reach the necessary two-thirds threshold.<br />The House impeached Mr. Trump last month on an article of inciting an insurrection in a 232-197 vote, with 10 Republicans joining all Democrats. So far, only six Senate Republicans have broken with their party to side with Democrats and against Mr. Trump on a key issue related to his defense: the constitutionality of trying a former president. With the Senate voting that the trial of a former president was constitutional, House managers and defense attorneys are squarely in the middle of a fight over the merits of the charge against Mr. Trump.<br />Lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.) and his fellow managers haven’t said what their next move is, but one option would be to use their remaining time to more fully connect the dots between Mr. Trump’s statements, tweets and speeches and the riot. So far, managers have aimed to show that Mr. Trump planned the attack by cultivating a base of people he knew to be violent, issuing a “save the date” notice through a Dec. 19 tweet calling for his supporters to “be there, will be wild,” and then timing his speech asserting that “you’ll never take back our country with weakness” to conclude just as Congress met in a joint session to certify President Biden’s Electoral College win.</td>

It added that “the prospect of tighter markets ahead” has been responsible for a rally in oil prices in recent weeks.</td>

And that isn’t unusual internationally. Tech companies, those plugged into the supply chain for electronics and some biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms boomed in 2020.<br />The advocates for profit-sharing or something like it have a stronger case than advocates of high corporate profit taxes: Much of the dispersion between the strong and weak performers over the past year has been down to luck rather than business ingenuity or astute management.<br />Among South Korea’s best-performing companies during the past year is  Seegene Inc.,  which recorded profit growth of more than 1,000% year-over-year in the third quarter. As a producer of diagnostic kits, it would have struggled to do poorly in the circumstances. On the other end of the scale,  Korean Air Lines Co.  has seen profits collapse.

She has been leading the handling of the hack fallout since day one of the Biden administration, said Emily Horne, an NSC spokeswoman. Officials didn't say why Ms. Neuberger’s role leading the response wasn’t disclosed sooner.<br />Ms. Neuberger is focused on directing federal agencies compromised in the hack toward specific remediation solutions and identifying issues in how the government has responded.

Ms. Neuberger is also focused on launching a study of the SolarWinds breach to learn lessons and to prevent such incidents in the future, Ms. Horne said.<br />On Tuesday, Sens.

The mix of migrants stayed largely steady from previous months, with single adults from Mexico accounting for most of the arrests, and families and unaccompanied children ticking up.<br />That continues a recent shift from the trend since 2014, when children and families from Central America, who are more likely to seek asylum, comprised the majority of migrants at the border.<br />The overall rise likely has several causes. Poverty and gang violence were exacerbated by a pair of hurricanes that hit Central America late last year, devastating the region’s economies. Mexico is suffering its worst economic slump in decades, prompting people to seek work across the border.<br />Authorities also said smugglers in the region have been telling migrants that President Biden’s administration, which has reversed many of the Trump administration’s strict immigration policies, would be more likely to allow them to stay in the U.S.</td>

House managers played audio of a terrified officer saying, “They have breached the scaffold, they are behind our lines.” They showed pro-Trump rioters bursting into the Capitol saying “stop the count,” converging at the threshold of the House floor with chants of “we want Trump,” and one rioter telling another who had called for no violence “it’s too late for that.” Another rioter could be heard calling out “Where are you Nancy?” and others could be heard chanting “Hang Mike Pence.” Managers played video of the fatal shooting of Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt as she tried to climb through a shattered window into the House lobby, and closed their predinner session by playing a single clip of Officer Daniel Hodges letting out a bone-chilling cry as rioters trapped him in between two doors, blood dripping from his mouth as he struggled to breathe.<br />House Democratic managers aimed to show that Mr. Trump planned the attack by cultivating a base of people he knew to be violent, issuing a “save the date” notice through a Dec. 19 tweet calling for his supporters to “be there, will be wild,” and then timing his speech asserting that “you’ll never take back our country with weakness” to conclude around 1 p.m.—just as Congress met in a joint session to certify President Biden’s Electoral College win. In the weeks before the attack, Mr. Trump’s supporters responded that “the cavalry is coming,” according to social-media posts that managers used to show rioters had been primed by months of Mr. Trump’s assertions that he would only lose if the election had been stolen.<br />Republicans said that despite the presentation, they weren’t convinced that Mr. Trump had caused the violence. “I don’t think it was inciting the riot,” said Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.). Seventeen Republicans are needed to join 50 Democrats in convicting the president. With only a handful of GOP senators indicating they could vote to convict him, the question was whether any new Republicans would be moved. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican, did say that the managers had “done a good job connecting the dots.”<br />The managers personalized their arguments by showing the stakes faced by individual senators. One of the most compelling videos depicted Officer Eugene Goodman directing Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) to turn around and run in a different direction, away from a mob that was bearing down on the Capitol. Mr. Romney said he had remembered the encounter but hadn’t realized the officer was Mr. Goodman, and that it was the first time he had seen the video. After it played at trial, Mr. Romney could be seen talking to Mr. Goodman, where he said he expressed his appreciation to the officer and heard about Mr. Goodman’s trials on Jan. 6, including the nausea he felt after being subjected to tear gas and bear spray.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Gold-medal Olympic swimmer Klete Keller was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges related to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, as prosecutors pursue additional counts against the alleged rioters including one that comes with a potential 20-year sentence.<br />In indictments returned Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Keller was charged with seven counts, including obstructing an official proceeding. Similar charges were also brought against two brothers from Montana who allegedly climbed through broken windows at the Capitol and forced their way to the Senate floor, and an alleged QAnon adherent from Iowa who was among the first rioters to enter the Capitol.<br />The law cited in the obstruction count falls under the broad witness-tampering statute and carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Many of the more than 200 people who face federal charges to date related to the Capitol riot were first arrested on criminal complaints that carried charges with lesser penalties. Prosecutors said they planned to seek indictments against most of the alleged rioters, and could add counts as the investigation progressed.<br />The brothers, Joshua and Jerod Hughes, and the Iowa man, Douglas Jensen, were allegedly part of a mob that chased Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman up a set of stairs close to the Senate chamber. That episode figured prominently in video footage shown by Democratic impeachment managers during Mr. Trump’s Senate trial on Wednesday.<br />Mr. Keller was first identified several days after the Capitol insurrection in widely circulated screenshots of video footage and photos taken inside the building. He stood out in the crowd for his height, 6-foot-6, and the navy blue jacket he wore bearing the seal of the U.S. Olympic Team. In addition to the obstruction charge, Mr. Keller faces counts of civil disorder, entering and engaging in disorderly conduct in a restricted building, and other counts. A lawyer for Mr. Keller declined to comment.</td>

      <td>BEIJING—About 90 people were hospitalized with Covid-19-like symptoms in central China in the two months before the disease was first identified in Wuhan in late 2019, according to World Health Organization investigators, who said they pressed Beijing to allow further testing to determine whether the new virus was spreading earlier than previously known.<br />Chinese authorities performed antibody tests on about two-thirds of those patients in the past few months, according to the investigators, and said they found no trace of infection by the virus. But members of the WHO team probing the pandemic’s origins said any antibodies could have subsided to undetectable levels during the delay.<br />“Further studies are needed,” said Peter Ben Embarek, the food-safety scientist who led the WHO team, which wrapped up a four-week visit to China on Wednesday.<br />Team members said they urged China to conduct wider tests on blood samples collected in autumn 2019 around Hubei, the province that is home to Wuhan, to look for evidence about when the virus was first circulating. Chinese authorities said they hadn’t yet obtained necessary permissions to test samples, many of which are held in blood banks, WHO investigators said.<br />China’s disclosures to the WHO raise questions about the possibility that Covid-19—which has now killed more than 2.3 million people—was already spreading in China as far back as October 2019 and that earlier detection could have helped contain the outbreak before it became a global pandemic. Beijing says the first patient identified in China developed symptoms on Dec. 8, 2019.</td>

      <td>Even a $130 billion bribe won’t get them back in the classroom this school year.</td>
      <td>President Biden made an early pandemic show by promising that a majority of American schools would reopen in his first 100 days in office. But on Tuesday we learned that this depends on the meaning of the word “reopen.”<br />“His goal that he set is to have the majority of schools, so more than 50 percent, open by day 100 of his presidency and that means some teaching in classrooms,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. “So at least one day a week.”<br />One day out of five? We doubt that’s how working parents define open.<br />Ms. Psaki is trying to make a virtue out of a humiliating political embarrassment. Mr. Biden figured that his support for the teachers union agenda, along with more money, would get the unions to reopen the schools. Instead he’s discovering what America’s parents have learned in the last year: Unions run the schools, and no one—not parents, not school districts, not mayors, and not even a new Democratic President—will tell them what to do. So it’s one day a week, pal. Get used to it.<br />This really is one of the great scandals of the pandemic. At first unions demanded that cases drop in their cities before schools open. Now cases are falling almost everywhere. So unions are insisting that teachers must be vaccinated before returning.</td>

      <td>He might be acquitted, but he won’t live down his disgraceful conduct.</td>
      <td>Whether a former President ought to be subject to an impeachment trial is a matter of constitutional debate. Whether it’s prudent, if acquittal appears likely, is a related question. But wherever you come down on those issues, the House impeachment managers this week are laying out a visceral case that the Capitol riot of Jan. 6 was a disgrace for which President Trump bears responsibility.<br />Long before November, Mr. Trump was saying that the only way he could lose the election was if it were rigged. On the night of the vote, he tweeted, “they are trying to STEAL the election.” In his speech that night, he called it “a fraud on the American public,” and said, “frankly we did win.” Is it a surprise that some of his fans took his words to heart?<br />Instead of bowing to dozens of court defeats, Mr. Trump escalated. He falsely claimed that Vice President Mike Pence, if only he had the courage, could reject electoral votes and stop Democrats from hijacking democracy. He called his supporters to attend a rally on Jan. 6, when Congress would do the counting. “Be there, will be wild!” Mr. Trump tweeted. His speech that day was timed to coincide with the action in the Capitol, and then he directed the crowd down Pennsylvania Avenue.<br />Mr. Trump’s defenders point out that he also told the audience to make their voices heard “peacefully.” And contra Rep. Eric Swalwell, who argued the incitement to attack the Capitol was “premeditated,” it’s difficult to think Mr. Trump ever envisioned what followed: that instead of merely making a boisterous display, the crowd would riot, assault the police, invade the building, send lawmakers fleeing with gas masks, trash legislative offices, and leave in its wake a dead Capitol officer.<br />But talk about playing with fire. Mr. Trump told an apocalyptic fable in which American democracy might end on Jan. 6, and some people who believed him acted like it. Once the riot began, Mr. Trump took hours to say anything, a delay his defenders have not satisfactorily explained. Even then he equivocated. Imagine, Rep. Joe Neguse said, if Mr. Trump “had simply gone onto TV, just logged on to  Twitter  and said ‘Stop the Attack,’ if he had done so with even half as much force as he said ‘Stop the Steal.’”</td>

      <td>Biden is rethinking Trump’s reckless May 1 withdrawal.</td>
      <td>October will mark 20 years since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan to eliminate al Qaeda sanctuaries and its Taliban sponsors, and Americans are understandably eager to move on. But the difficulties that come with America’s current commitment are nothing compared with the chaos that would follow an abrupt departure.<br />In February 2020 the Trump Administration and Taliban signed a withdrawal agreement that requires all U.S. troops to leave by May 1, 2021. The move was driven by Donald Trump’s domestic political instincts—not a strategic calculation. President Biden is wisely reviewing that decision.<br />“I’m very pleased with what the Biden Administration is proposing for Afghanistan,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said on Sunday. “They’re re-evaluating our presence in Afghanistan to keep the footprint low, but not to walk away and lose all the gains we’ve achieved.” The White House hasn’t announced a final decision, but Mr. Graham expects the U.S. to remain beyond May.<br />Many Democrats and isolationist-leaning Republicans get attention for their calls to end “forever wars” immediately. But Mr. Graham’s comments are a reminder that there’s also broad support for a more careful approach. The question is not whether the U.S. will leave Afghanistan but whether it will do so responsibly.<br />The bipartisan Afghanistan Study Group has made a persuasive case for how to do that in its report to Congress this month. The group—former generals, Senators, ambassadors and national-security officials—suggests replacing Mr. Trump’s timeline with a conditions-based approach. “A withdrawal would not only leave America more vulnerable to terrorist threats,” the report says, “it would also have catastrophic effects in Afghanistan and the region that would not be in the interest of any of the key actors, including the Taliban.”</td>

      <td>The Biden spending bill will have governors swimming in cash.</td>
      <td>Governors—especially from Democratic states—have been pleading revenue poverty since the pandemic began. But as we approach the anniversary of Covid-19 in America, that tall tale is becoming more difficult to sell.<br />Even the left-tilting media are beginning to figure out what we’ve been reporting for some time. One of our sources is Dan Clifton, of Strategas Research Partners, who has been tracking state revenue trends and Covid relief from the beginning. His latest analysis shows that state revenues have been doing far better than advertised, especially states that have kept their economies largely open.<br />He estimates that a majority of the 50 states are seeing revenues arrive above their pre-Covid levels despite the 2020 economic damage. The big exceptions are states that had the most restrictive business lockdowns (New York), those that rely on sales taxes and have no income tax (Florida and Texas), and those that depend on travel and tourism (Nevada).<br />Add the $350 billion windfall that will soon flow to state and local governments from the $1.9 trillion Biden relief bill, and the states will be swimming in cash. Mr. Clifton projects that the states overall will have a combined budget surplus. The federal aid formula would provide an average of 20% of all state tax revenue.<br />California already has tax revenue coming in above its pre-pandemic level, thanks to a buoyant stock market and capital gains. But it will receive another $27 billion from federal taxpayers, or 17% of the state’s entire general fund revenue. Pennsylvania will receive $7.1 billion, or 20% of its tax revenue.</td>

      <td>He was a Marine, an economist, a diplomat, a patriot and a statesman. He was also my friend.</td>
      <td>George Shultz came into my life some 50 years ago and never left it. He was secretary of labor, but President Nixon asked him to study the trend in oil prices because before coming into government George had been an economist at the University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I was Nixon’s national security adviser and George called on me to discuss a conclusion he thought might affect my policy portfolio. The price of oil was then around $3.35 a barrel, but George warned me that U.S. production was projected to fall considerably; a greater reliance on imports was therefore inevitable. The price of oil would rise—perhaps precipitously. The bargaining power of foreign oil producers would skyrocket. Events proved George right.<br />His career in government continued as director of the Office of Management and Budget and Treasury secretary. His calm demeanor made him influential in interagency discussions. Colleagues knew that when he raised issues, it was out of deep concern. Never seeking personal advancement, always expressing sincere convictions, George invariably became a driving force on every committee. Our relationship evolved from association to partnership, and then to a friendship that lasted for the rest of our lives.<br />After the Nixon years, he served as president of the Bechtel Corp. before returning to government as secretary of state in the Reagan administration. In that capacity he built a cooperative relationship with China and greatly expanded cultural and economic relations. Contrary to today’s revisionist narrative, the U.S.-China relationship at that time was based on specific, shared strategic benefits. With his Soviet counterpart, George negotiated the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the only Cold War agreement that eliminated a category of nuclear weapons. The crowning achievement of George’s diplomacy was to see the Cold War to a peaceful conclusion.<br />For all his proximity to presidents and important roles, George was never seduced by the trappings of power. “It’s a great mistake to want the job too much, because then you do things to keep the job that you probably wouldn’t do otherwise,” he once said. His equanimity was not contrived; outer composure reflected an inner serenity.<br />In the last two decades of George’s life, the control of nuclear weapons became his chief preoccupation. He approached nuclear arms control the same way he tackled every other issue of public importance—by engaging in deep study, assembling the best group of advisers, and then making deliberate contributions to the public debate, often in these pages.</td>

From the back of the room, Ron Klain, the president’s chief of staff, shook his head vigorously in disagreement when Republicans raised issues, apparently signaling to the president how to react.<br />So when White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed afterward that Mr. Biden “welcomes the opportunity to work” with Republicans, it was, to use a favorite word of her boss, malarkey.<br />How do we know Team Biden’s stated desire for bipartisanship is folderol? Because the administration made no serious effort to consider GOP proposals. Instead, it quickly gave congressional Republicans the back of its hand by complaining publicly they weren’t mounting “a serious negotiating effort.” For this White House, the loyal opposition must fall in line—no compromise, only capitulation.</td>

This unanimity surprised Jonathan Marks because, as he puts it, professors “are nothing if not quarrelsome and contentious.” Mr. Marks published an open letter describing “the complete absence of dissent [as] a sign of disciplinary ill health.” He urged skeptics from within the group to break their silence.<br />“It has been seven years, and not one blog post or op-ed has surfaced,” reports Mr. Marks in “Let’s Be Reasonable,” an engaging apologia for liberal education from the perspective of “that rare beast, the conservative professor.” Rather than ranting against institutions that have turned his kind into an endangered species, Mr. Marks, who teaches politics at Ursinus College in Pennsylvania, blends humor with argument as he makes his case for a renewed vision of higher learning. What he proposes is attractive in its fundamentals, and certainly persuasive, but also perhaps too hopeful about the prospects for reform.<br />The anecdote about the Association for Asian American Studies would seem to provide more proof that progressives have turned yet another precinct of academia into a one-party state of left-wing dogma. Mr. Marks, however, insists that “the present is not as bad a time as the shouting of culture warriors and the lectures of consultants might lead us despairingly to believe.” When anti-Zionist activism arrived on his campus, for example, Mr. Marks enlisted “a colleague with whom I’d butted heads” to form discussion groups with students. They agreed to look at “the same evidence together and hold each other’s arguments up to scrutiny.” These efforts apparently reduced tensions. They also filled Mr. Marks with optimism: “I think the overwhelming majority of university people—students, faculty, staff—agree, most of the time, that rational inquiry is fruitful, even honorable.”<br />The lesson for Mr. Marks is that his fellow conservatives should stop disparaging colleges and universities and strive to salvage them. He notes that “The Closing of the American Mind,” the 1987 book by Allan Bloom, his former teacher at the University of Chicago and a hero to many conservatives, “was full of love for universities” even as it faulted them for becoming factories of moral relativism. Mr. Marks describes “God and Man at Yale,” the 1951 book by William F. Buckley Jr. that accused the professoriate of embracing socialism and secularism, as belonging to the same tradition. Today, by contrast, conservatism is done with the “lovers’ quarrel” that characterized its earlier critiques of the university. Now it’s “in the midst of a bitter divorce, and more inclined to murder its ex than to try to win her back.”<br />“Let’s Be Reasonable” isn’t a sequel to the books by Bloom and Buckley, but it’s written in much the same spirit, and its best quality is its thoughtful defense of liberal education. At a time when many people view colleges and universities as nothing more than “career development offices with classrooms attached,” Mr. Marks imagines something else: “The highest aim of liberal education is not a set of skills but a kind of person.” He recommends readings and conversations guided by wise professors who seek to help students “answer the question of what we are and what the best way of life is.”</td>

      <td>A gift horse arrives thanks to the Covid stimulus. Let’s look it right in the mouth.</td>
      <td>I never thought the old saying “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth” applied to me, since until last year I never received unexpected gifts. But now my wife and I find ourselves looking into the mouth of a “gift horse”—stimulus checks. To be precise, there were no checks; $2,400 and then $1,200 were deposited directly into our checking account. Apparently we’re going to get another $2,800.<br />Free money—wow! But we don’t want it. We don’t need it. The program is popular. According to a recent poll, nearly 8 of 10 Americans approve of giving out payments of $1,400. The trouble is that plenty of the people who qualify do fine without the handout.<br />We do because we have an adjusted gross income of $78,000, from Social Security and three small pensions. Our expenses are low. Our mortgage, $1,500 a month, is almost paid off. Our two adult children support themselves. Our seven-year-old car is paid for. My wife rarely drinks; I have one beer a day, which costs around $10 a week.<br />We can’t afford to take luxury cruises or go often to expensive restaurants, but we can travel to Europe every other year and rent a beach house for a week every summer.<br />“Anyone who lives within his means suffers from a lack of imagination,” the actor Lionel Stander observed. For many years we lived beyond our means, traveling frequently as we supported our daughters’ college education. But in the past 15 years we’ve had no credit-card debt. Most important, we have a superb medical plan. We rarely have copayments. We also have good dental insurance.</td>

      <td>Fed chairman also says monetary policy alone won’t be enough to restore the labor market to full strength</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve will continue bolstering the U.S. economy through low interest rates and hefty asset purchases, Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday, stressing that the labor market remains stunted by the pandemic.<br />The Fed is unlikely to “even think about withdrawing policy support” by raising rates or reducing its bond purchases for the foreseeable future, Mr. Powell said at a virtual appearance before the Economic Club of New York.<br />The Fed chief also repeated his call for more fiscal assistance for the economy, saying that monetary policy alone won’t be enough to restore the labor market to full strength. “It will require a society-wide commitment, with contributions from across government and the private sector,” Mr. Powell said.<br />“Workers and households who struggle to find their place in the post-pandemic economy are likely to need continued support,” he said. “The same is true for many small businesses that are likely to prosper again once the pandemic is behind us.”<br />The U.S. economy shrank 3.5% last year, its largest yearly contraction since just after World War II, the Commerce Department reported. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 6.3% in January from 6.7% a month earlier, the Labor Department said Friday. That compares with a 3.5% unemployment rate in February 2020, before the pandemic struck.</td>

      <td>A decision on case, argued in November, is pending before the high court</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration told the Supreme Court that the Affordable Care Act remains constitutional, reversing the Trump Justice Department’s position that the entire health-care overhaul was void because Congress reduced to zero the penalty for failing to carry insurance.<br />“Following the change in Administration, the Department of Justice has reconsidered the government’s position,” Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler said in a two-page letter to the justices Wednesday on the pending case.<br />The move was expected, as President Biden campaigned on expanding Obamacare along with a more vigorous federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. Former President Trump throughout his term denounced to the signature law of the Obama administration, although he never proposed any alternative healthcare program after the Republican-controlled Congress rejected legislation to repeal the measure.<br />Texas’s Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, sued to strike down the Affordable Care Act after Congress in 2017 reduced the penalty to zero. With Trump administration backing, he argued the law no longer was constitutional because it no longer generated revenue for the U.S. Treasury. The argument extrapolated from the 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding the law, which required most individuals to carry health insurance or pay a penalty along with their income taxes, under Congress’ authority to levy taxes.<br />The 2012 decision found that the insurance mandate effectively offered individuals a choice of paying a tax or carrying insurance, rather than a dictate to purchase a product against their will.</td>

A Saudi terrorism court in a secretive trial sentenced Ms. Hathloul in December to nearly six years in prison on charges of incitement against the regime and serving a foreign agenda.<br />She was released Wednesday on three years’ probation, with a five-year travel ban, after a reduction for time served. “She is not free. The fight is not over,” her sister tweeted.<br />Mr. Biden, speaking at the Pentagon, said Ms. Hathloul’s release was welcome news: “She is a powerful advocate for women’s rights, and releasing her was the right thing to do.”</td>

      <td>Released in conjunction with her movie of the same name, the pop artist’s new album is feel-good albeit generic.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />Sia Furler’s life in music has followed a strange and winding path. The Australian-born artist, now age 45, spent the 1990s and early ’00s in relative obscurity, playing with a few bands, landing the occasional guest vocal, and releasing a handful of solo records as simply Sia. Back then, much of her own work was loose and jazzy folk-pop, including “Breathe Me,” which in 2005 memorably provided the soundtrack for the closing scene from the acclaimed HBO series “Six Feet Under.” Later in that decade, she began writing for other singers and turned out to be very good at it. She topped the charts as a songwriter with Rihanna’s 2012 smash “Diamonds” and used that momentum to reboot her solo career. Her own hits, and those she’s written for others, represent an influential approach to pop craftsmanship, one in which hugely catchy melodic phrases are married to uplifting lyrics to generate anthems about empowerment.<br />Ms. Furler’s success as a songwriter has afforded her an opportunity to work in other mediums. “Music” (Atlantic / Monkey Puzzle), her ninth studio album, out Friday, is a companion to a film of the same name that she co-wrote and directed. It stars Kate Hudson, Leslie Odom Jr. and dancer Maddie Ziegler, who has appeared in many of Ms. Furler’s music videos, in a story about a child on the autism spectrum named Music. Following her grandmother’s death, the girl, played by Ms. Ziegler, is suddenly thrust into the care of her troubled sister (Ms. Hudson), a former drug dealer who is herself struggling to survive. (The movie has drawn fire for being insensitive in its handling of autism, and also in its casting, with some activists suggesting the title role should have gone to an actor with the condition.) The drama unfolds alongside elaborately staged fantasy sequences representing Music’s internal life.</td>

      <td>Sales have been surging since stores reopened and company had been bringing back many workers who were furloughed in April</td>
      <td>Best Buy Co.  notified workers this week that it was cutting some jobs at its big box stores, according to people familiar with the situation, as the retailer adapts to a world where more shopping happens online.<br />The company has reported skyrocketing sales in recent quarters as pandemic-weary shoppers stock up on appliances, videogame systems and other electronics. Comparable sales, those from websites or stores operating for at least 12 months, rose 23% in the quarter ended Oct. 31. Much of the gains came from online orders, which nearly tripled in the U.S. in the last quarter.<br />A spokesman for the company declined to comment on the details of the job cuts. “As we have said before, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital,” said the spokesman. “Our workforce will need to evolve to meet the evolving needs of customers while providing more flexible opportunities for our people.”<br />The company had 125,000 full-time and part-time workers as of January 2020. Best Buy furloughed about 51,000 of its workers early in April, including nearly all its part-time employees, as it closed most of its stores early in the pandemic to all but curbside pickup. In June, Best Buy began bringing back furloughed workers and in August raised its starting wage to $15 an hour.<br />After reporting strong third-quarter sales, executives said in November that the outlook was uncertain for the rest of the year. The company said it would resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter and close all its stores in Mexico, its smallest market. The company reports full year earnings Feb. 25.</td>

      <td>The administration aims to have more than 50% of schools open at least one day a week in its first 100 days, a bar Republicans call too low</td>
      <td>After President Biden made an ambitious promise to help reopen a majority of K-8 schools in his first 100 days, the White House said this week the pledge means opening more than 50% of schools for in-person teaching at least one day a week.<br />The comments drew criticism from Republicans and some parents, amid growing debate over how to define opening schools. The fresh tension comes as many districts around the country remain in virtual mode amid the winter jump in Covid-19 cases and deaths, the spread of new coronavirus strains, the slow vaccination rollout and clashes between state authorities and teachers’ unions.<br />White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the goal was “at least one day a week in the majority of schools, by day 100.” On Wednesday she stressed that this was “not the ceiling, that is the bar we’re trying to leap over and exceed.”<br />“Certainly, we are not planning to celebrate at 100 days if we reach that goal. That is our own effort to set our own markings, set a bold and ambitious agenda for how we’re going to measure ourselves and progress,” she said. “But we certainly hope to build from that, even at 100 days.”<br />Several congressional Republicans criticized that goal on Wednesday. “The Biden Administration’s stated goal of reopening 50% of classrooms for one day a week is unacceptable. Our students deserve more,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said on Twitter.</td>

      <td>Iranian breaches of the 2015 nuclear deal raise fears that the country is paving the way to start work on nuclear weapons, raising pressure on President Biden</td>
      <td>Iran has in recent months repeatedly violated the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reducing the time it would need to produce a nuclear weapon. The violations, a response to U.S. sanctions imposed after former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact in 2018, have put at risk the survival of an agreement that helped remove sanctions on Iran and open it to business with the West.<br />The latest development was revealed on Feb. 10 when the International Atomic Energy Agency told member states in a confidential report that Iran had begun producing uranium metal, a material vital for nuclear weapons. Iran had told the agency in mid-December that it planned to produce uranium metal, but that production would require four to five months to install the equipment to produce the powder from which uranium metal is made. Iran has said it would produce uranium metal for civilian purposes, though the uranium metal produced this month might not be related to this work.<br />In January, Iran made one of its biggest steps yet to breach the 2015 deal, announcing it had begun enriching uranium at 20% purity. That crossed a red line previously set by European powers that are still party to the accord.<br />The most recent disclosure of uranium metal production—which has limited civilian utility—has stirred concern among Western officials over whether Iran is preparing to restart work toward a nuclear weapon.<br />Uranium metal is often used in the core of nuclear weapons. Production of the material is a clear breach of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers, in which it agreed to a 15-year moratorium on uranium and plutonium metallurgical production.</td>

The net loss for the period narrowed to $968 million from $1.09 billion in the year-earlier quarter.<br />Uber’s adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization also narrowed in the latest quarter to $454 million, compared with a loss of $615 million a year earlier.

      <td>The author of ‘Detransition, Baby: A Novel,’ on how a vintage trench coat lined with nutria—or giant swamp rats—became her style trademark</td>
      <td>AUTHORS OFTEN become identified with an item of clothing—Zadie Smith, for instance, is known for her head wraps, and Fran Lebowitz is never without a blazer—so I have taken the pre-emptive step of wearing, everywhere I go, a long black vintage trench coat lined with the fur of nutria. For those of you who have never encountered them, nutria are giant swamp rats. It is the perfect coat for queer nightlife in New York City. You can put it on over a little outfit to stay warm and modest for the train ride; the boring raincoat exterior hides the fur so you don’t offend the vegans. And the coat doubles as bedding if you crash on someone’s couch. I own this perfect coat as a result of a long family saga and two failed fashion fur fads, one in the 1950s and one in the 1990s.<br />My mom grew up in the 1950s on a chinchilla farm just beyond the Minneapolis suburbs. My grandparents called their little enterprise a “ranch”—in actual fact, it was 300 of the fuzzy South American creatures nuzzling around in the basement of their two-story farmhouse. Chinchillas have more hair per square inch than almost any other mammal. Humans grow one to three hairs per follicle, chinchillas grow up to 75. The abundance of hair on a chinchilla made its fur a status item at the turn of the 20th century. Trappers hunted the chinchilla to near extinction in its native Andes. In the 1910s, the Chilean government attempted to conserve the last few chinchillas by trapping them alive to sell to breeders. In all, 132 of the animals made their way to the U.S. A colony of chinchillas was not found in the wild again until the 1970s.<br />After World War II, breeders in the U.S. began to market the animals not as pelts, but as a get-rich-quick scheme. They targeted young couples with claims that chinchillas could be raised with minimal effort in spare spaces around the home. At the time, my grandparents told me, a chinchilla pelt, still a rare luxury, could sell for over $100. My grandparents fell for it. They drove to Colorado and paid $3,000 for three mating pairs—more than they’d paid for their car. Other couples did the same, and the price plummeted in a chinchilla fur glut. My grandparents spent the next 16 years, my mother’s entire childhood, attempting to recoup their investment. My grandmother never earned enough money to own a chinchilla-fur coat herself.<br />My mom promised herself that when she could afford a fur coat, she’d buy one, to take pleasure in what had been only labor in her childhood. But by the 1990s, when she could afford it, fur coats had become suspect. One did not waltz around in fur in the ’90s without the risk of being shamed or even spray-painted.<br />At the same time, nutria, the large invasive South American rodents, were posing a serious environmental threat to the fragile wetlands of Louisiana. Traders brought nutria to the U.S. in the 1930s and some of the pests escaped into Louisiana’s swamps. The non-native animals eat the plants that hold the bottom soil together, leading to dangerous erosion. Louisiana began paying a $5 bounty for each nutria slain, and hunters often neglected to properly dispose of the bodies, leaving them in the swamps. Fashion furriers, noting this, began to buy the pelts to market as a “guilt-free” fur. Why not wear what would otherwise decay?</td>

      <td>Iran has produced material that is banned under the 2015 nuclear accords and could be used to form the core of a nuclear weapon, as it seeks to escalate pressure on the Biden administration to lift sanctions.<br />A confidential report by the United Nations atomic agency, seen by The Wall Street Journal, said Iran had started producing uranium metal on Feb. 6 at a nuclear facility in Isfahan that is under the agency’s inspection.<br />The material produced was a small amount of natural uranium metal, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported, meaning it wasn’t enriched. To use uranium metal, Iran would need around half a kilogram, or slightly more than one pound, of highly enriched uranium metal.<br />The Iranian government in December warned that it could start producing uranium metal within five months, following a law passed in Iran’s Parliament on Dec. 1, a threat that alarmed Western diplomats.<br />Iran has taken a series of recent steps in breach of the nuclear accord. It has increased its production of nuclear fuel, carried out enrichment in new sites and earlier this year produced 20% enriched uranium, the highest purity of the material it has made since 2013.</td>

In its Spring 2021 press presentation last November, retail site Net-a-Porter reported that, based on its sales data, customers were drifting away from faddish seasonal pieces and toward luxury classics, like eternally chic Saint Laurent blazers and sleek-but-relaxed pants from the Row. Key factors: All the time we’re spending at home (there’s no point trying to impress a cat with zeitgeisty trendiness) and a heightened awareness of how “in one season, out the next” clothing creates waste.<br />All this is driving women to invest in heirloom-quality clothing that will last not just for a few years, but for the next generation.

      <td>The U.S. budget gap totaled a record $736 billion during the first four months of fiscal 2021, Treasury says</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal spending climbed last month as the U.S. Treasury issued another round of stimulus checks and other federal aid following a December economic relief deal in Congress, widening the budget deficit for the fiscal year.<br />The U.S. budget gap totaled a record $736 billion during the first four months of fiscal 2021, an 89% increase compared with the same period a year earlier, as government spending outpaced revenue, the Treasury Department said Wednesday. Receipts totaled nearly $1.2 trillion, a 1% rise and a record from October through January, while outlays increased a record 23%, to $1.9 trillion, largely due to higher spending on safety-net programs such as jobless benefits and Medicaid.<br />For the 12 months that ended in January, the deficit totaled $3.47 trillion, or 16.2% as a share of economic output.<br />A surge of spending to combat the coronavirus pandemic and cushion the U.S. economy from the related downturn, coupled with weaker tax revenues, has sent deficits soaring over the past year to levels not seen since the end of World War II. Rising red ink is now at the center of a debate in Congress over whether lawmakers should approve more spending to bolster the economy, and support households and businesses until the pandemic is brought under control.<br />Congress enacted a roughly $900 billion bill at the end of December that began to take effect last month, boosting federal spending at the start of 2021. Among the costliest provisions was $142 billion in stimulus payments, of which $139 billion were made in January, the Treasury said, and $25 billion in rental-assistance grants to state and local governments.</td>

      <td>Some designers opt for two dining-room tables to shake things up and diversify the function of an underused room. Others find the look cold, or worse. Here, both sides.</td>
      <td>For the recurring series, That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and other emphatically opposed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />A single Downton Abbey- sized dining table is so last century, argue advocates for multiple tables in a dining room. “Clients tell us that the dining room is often one of the best rooms in the house but hardly gets used,” said Joe Nahem, a designer in New York. Modern families—especially during a pandemic—expect this space to tick a lot of boxes. A second table can function as a desk, kids’ craft area or a forum for jigsaw-puzzling. “Put bookshelves in the room and it becomes more than just a dining room,” said Benjamin Noriega-Ortiz, another New York designer. When only two or four people sit for dinner, a “four top” suffices, without leaving you with a disconcerting airfield of unused surface. When full-on dinner parties return, you can push the tables together. Or, other designers note, a hosting couple can divide and conquer, with each presiding over a more intimate group. “At one long table, conversations happen in smaller groups anyway,” said New York designer Kristen McGinnis. Mr. Noriega-Ortiz likes to mix styles and shapes so the resulting arrangement is “homey and doesn’t feel like you’re in a conference room.” In one project, he surrounded two pedestal tables with built-in seating, woven rush chairs and a modern Windsor chair. Mr. Nahem dispels conference-room connotations with a rug, big enough to embrace both seating arrangements. Of course, one needs a large, if not mansion-esque, room, he said, “maybe 12 by 18 feet.”<br />Sacrifice grand, center-of-the-room chandeliers. Overhead lighting, mounted flush or close to the ceiling, should illuminate both tables whether they are united or split apart.<br />It felt like a lobby of a hotel,” recalled Viktor Udzenija of a residential London dining room in which he and other guests were seated at multiple tables. Mr. Udzenija, an architect and interior designer with offices in Prague and Dubai, found the seating arrangement not only impersonal but embittering: Every time laughter broke out at a nearby table, he endured a case of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out, a condition more commonly induced by social media). His credo? “One table, no matter how big, is more inclusive, grand and [better] represents the idea of coming together.” In cases where a two-person household has a 10-foot table, Christopher Coleman, of Miami’s Sanchez + Coleman Studio, sees an opportunity to put blessedly beautiful possessions on exhibit. “One client had a collection of interesting candlesticks—all different sizes and materials—that took up a third of the table, another had stacks of books and we have a collection of 30 glass vases on ours,” he said. “You can still seat four to six people without moving [the objets].” Those who don’t want to dedicate a lot of square footage to a large table should invest in a smaller one with removable leaves. Designer Michelle Gerson of New York looks for “intentional” leaves that come together in a purposeful metal strip versus “ugly seams.”<br />Ms. Gerson feels diplomacy always dictates one table over two. That way, she said, “no one is hurt thinking they are at the good table or the bad table or the A table or the B table.”</td>

Mr. Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to lose the state since 1992; the loss was confirmed by two statewide recounts and a partial forensic audit.<br />The letters didn’t mention Mr. Trump by name but referred to media reports of contacts with the Georgia secretary of state’s office, the U.S. attorney’s office in Atlanta and others—indicating the probe is focused on the post-election efforts by Mr. Trump and his supporters to reverse his loss in the state.<br />Ms. Willis sent the notices to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who are all Republicans, according to a spokesman for the district attorney and copies obtained by The Wall Street Journal. The spokesman said he could confirm the investigation had been opened but couldn’t name the subjects of the probe.</td>

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (Unrwa) is the only U.N. body mandated to deliver humanitarian assistance, health care, education and protection to Palestine refugees living in the Middle East today. Contrary to the authors’ claims, under international law and the principle of family unity the children of Palestine refugees and their descendants are also considered refugees until a durable solution is found. Both Unrwa and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recognize descendants as refugees on this basis.<br />Governments around the world acknowledge Unrwa’s work is an important part of maintaining regional stability until a lasting political solution is found. In December 2019, when Unrwa’s U.N. mandate was up for its regular three-year renewal, member states voted overwhelmingly in support of renewing Unrwa’s mandate, recognizing the agency as a vital source of stability in a region rife with ongoing conflict.<br />Unrwa doesn’t perpetuate refugee status in the Middle East. Responsibility for the protracted nature of the plight of Palestine refugees lies squarely and clearly with the parties to the conflict. Eroding or erasing Unrwa doesn’t solve the refugee problem. It will, however, ensure that more than 530,000 children cannot attend school; that some 140 health clinics cannot provide vaccines; and more than one million refugees in Gaza don’t get food assistance. Destroying those services and programs is hardly a step toward peace and security.<br />Elizabeth Campbell<br />Unrwa</td>

She declined to say when the budget would be released or in what form.<br />Mr. Biden’s advisers raised concerns publicly in December that staff in Mr. Trump’s budget office had rebuffed requests for information necessary to help them prepare to take over the government.<br />Yohannes Abraham, then a senior Biden transition official, said OMB officials hadn’t shared sufficient details on “Covid-related expenditures” and were refusing to work with the incoming administration on developing a budget.<br />An OMB spokesman said at the time the department had provided Mr. Biden’s team with “everything they have requested,” including briefings on the government’s initiative to distribute a Covid-19 vaccine. The spokesman added that it was “not an OMB transition responsibility” to help Mr. Biden’s team draft budget proposals.

The tentative agreement is a stamp of approval for Archer, which said Wednesday that it will go public through a combination with a special-purpose acquisition company in a deal that values the combined company at about $3.8 billion.<br />United and  Mesa Air Group Inc.,  a regional carrier that is joining with United on the purchase, said they envision using the taxis to whisk passengers over congested highways to hub airports. The taxis, which Archer said will be capable of flying 60 miles at 150 miles an hour, could nearly halve carbon dioxide emissions for passengers traveling from Hollywood to Los Angeles International Airport, United said.<br />Airlines say technology like flying electric taxis can help them reduce emissions, though they say there isn’t currently a substitute for the jet-fuel powered engines that power most aircraft. Batteries cannot match the energy density of jet fuel, and airline executives have said that electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft may only be useful for short trips.</td>

The sales ended Fidelity’s run as the volatile stock’s largest shareholder.<br />It has been an eventful year for GameStop and its investors.<br />Shares of the company rocketed above $300 a share from less than $20 in January as individual investors turned to message boards on Reddit and urged one another to bid up the stock. The rally pressured other investors who were betting on a selloff. In the ensuing short squeeze, bearish investors had to buy more stock to close out their positions. Their purchases only drove the stock price higher.<br />Some bearish hedge funds, including Melvin Capital Management, took heavy losses—a development hailed by some individual investors as a triumph over Wall Street.</td>

      <td>Cryptocurrency is rising on a wave of enthusiasm. Yet its fundamentals have genuine value.</td>
      <td>Chances are in the past few weeks someone has given you a stock tip—maybe to buy bitcoin or invest in  GameStop .  In part because of Covid-induced boredom, the country is witnessing an unprecedented interest in financial speculation. This craze is fueled by business celebrities like Elon Musk, who announced Monday that his company Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin. Last Thursday Mr. Musk tweeted in support of the cryptocurrency dogecoin, which was created as a joke in 2013.<br />What is the average investor to make of all this? When stocks shift by hundreds of percentage points in a day, there’s only so much the government can do to protect you. Instead, investors should look past the tweets and Reddit posts and get back to fundamentals.<br />Yes, even bitcoin has fundamentals. There are two stories you can tell about Mr. Musk’s promotion of bitcoin. The first is a cynical one, in which he is using his media platform to pump an inherently speculative asset that he will dump, enriching himself at others’ expense.<br />The second story is honorable: Mr. Musk has keyed in on bitcoin’s value as an asset that can’t be manipulated by central banks. He understands bitcoin’s fixed supply, and in a world of seemingly unlimited monetary stimulus he’d like to promote the separation of money and state. The value of all money, even traditional currencies, is determined in part by public demand, and Mr. Musk’s driving up bitcoin’s price is no scandal in itself. Perhaps that’s what he meant when he tweeted, “Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money.”<br />Though bitcoin may be rising on a thin wave of enthusiasm, its fundamentals have real value. I teach a course on cryptocurrency, and I urge my students to look past the allure of easy money and focus on the philosophy, technology and political economy that differentiate bitcoin and its peers from traditional currencies.</td>

But the survey, which gauged responses from about 80,000 adults between Jan. 20-Feb. 1, shows geographic and demographic divides in the willingness to get vaccinated.<br />Residents of Southern states are least committed to getting a vaccine, while those in the Northeast show the most willingness to get a shot.<br />Conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and developed in concert with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics, the survey will continue with data released every two weeks.<br />While about 1-in-5 unvaccinated whites and Hispanics say they definitely or probably won’t get a shot, that number rises to about one-third among Blacks. Black and Hispanic populations have been among the hardest-hit in the pandemic. Less than 40% of Black respondents who hadn’t yet received a vaccine said they would definitely get one, compared with 59% of whites.</td>

And perhaps we were too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time,” she told the European Parliament on Wednesday.<br />The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, has come under intense criticism in recent weeks for how it has handled contracts on behalf of the EU’s 27 countries, after several pharmaceutical companies announced production shortages that further delay an already slow vaccination campaign in Europe.<br />The bloc is trailing far behind Israel, the U.K. and the U.S. with just 3.9 vaccinations per 100 inhabitants, in part because of a slow market-authorization process and patchy logistics. In addition, producers of the Oxford- AstraZeneca ,   Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have announced delays in deliveries to the EU.<br />Ms. von der Leyen defended the unprecedented decision by the bloc’s governments to centralize purchases, amid calls from some politicians in her native Germany to order vaccines on a national basis.</td>

      <td>The music industry distanced itself from the rising country star—but his latest album tops the charts. What the industry’s moves mean for his career and country music</td>
      <td>Before Big Loud Records suspended Morgan Wallen last week for making a racial slur, the 27-year-old singer was on his way to becoming country music’s next big superstar. Music executives say he ticked all of Nashville’s boxes: a compelling voice, well-crafted songs about small towns, drinking and relationships, a commercial sound made for radio and a little old-school swagger. Most importantly, he became a streaming giant—a rarity in country music, which historically has lagged behind hip-hop and other genres on streaming services.<br />His rapid rise appeared to falter last week after the East Tennessee star was captured on video calling one of the people in his group of friends the N-word as he said goodnight. (The video started circulating on Tuesday evening.) Mr. Wallen apologized immediately. But the reaction was just as swift: On Wednesday country-music radio stations dropped him from the airwaves and streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music removed him from important playlists, though he remained searchable. WME, his talent agency, dropped him, according to a spokesperson. Many believed the distancing would lay a blow to his streaming prospects.<br />On Sunday, however, Mr. Wallen’s latest album, “Dangerous,” hit No. 1 on Billboard’s all-genre album sales chart for the fourth straight week since its release—which hasn’t happened for a country album in about 18 years. Early indications suggest it could be No. 1 again next week. Music-industry experts answered key questions about Mr. Wallen and what the controversy means (and doesn’t mean) for country music:<br />It’s still early days. But Mr. Wallen’s sales are steady and even rising, albeit with some caveats.<br />Billboard’s album chart tracks numbers from Friday to Thursday. Mr. Wallen’s album “Dangerous” moved 149,000 “equivalent-album units” in the latest week ending Thursday, Feb. 4, a measurement that includes U.S. sales and streaming. That’s up 14% from the previous week.</td>

      <td>Fears of suppression grow, given the military’s history of deadly violence against pro-democracy demonstrations</td>
      <td>Protesters in Myanmar poured into the streets for the fifth straight day Wednesday to oppose last week’s military coup, despite an escalating use of force by authorities.<br />A day earlier, police fired gunshots to disperse protesters, and used rubber bullets and water cannons, causing injuries and raising fears of harsher suppression. The United Nations expressed strong concern over Tuesday’s police action, saying the use of disproportionate force was unacceptable, and the U.S. condemned violence against demonstrators.<br />Tens of thousands of people have participated in street rallies and marches against the Feb. 1 takeover. The coup ended a democratic shift in the country that began a decade ago and abruptly put Myanmar back into the hands of the military, which has ruled it for much of the past seven decades since independence from British colonial rule. In past years of army domination, security forces relied on arrests, batons, militias and guns to put down pro-democracy uprisings.<br />Protesters are demanding that the military release hugely popular civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whom they detained as her government was deposed, and hand back power. In a speech Monday night, the leader of the coup, military chief Min Aung Hlaing, promised to build a “genuine and disciplined democratic system.” New elections would be held, he said, though it isn’t known what the terms of any such vote would be.<br />Signs that authorities might use greater force to suppress protests have been growing since Monday. As demonstrations surged in towns and cities throughout Myanmar, an ominous message appeared on state television, saying action would be taken against those who were disturbing the country’s stability and that lawbreakers shouldn’t be tolerated. Later, authorities effectively banned protests in parts of the country’s two largest cities, Yangon and Mandalay.</td>

Payment company  Square Inc.,  which Mr. Dorsey also leads, recently acquired about $50 million worth of bitcoin for its corporate treasury.<br />Mr. Segal’s comments came days after electric-vehicle maker  Tesla Inc.  said it had purchased $1.5 billion in bitcoin.

That will fuel a debate, already under way, over whether the large amount of Covid-19 relief coming out of Washington adds up to more than the economy can safely handle.<br />What the debate might hinge on is the answer to one question: How long will higher inflation persist?<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that consumer prices rose 0.3% last month from December, putting them 1.4% above their year-earlier level. Prices excluding food and energy items—the so-called core aimed at better reflecting inflation’s underlying trend—were up 1.4% from a year earlier.<br />So for now inflation is well below the 2% the Federal Reserve is aiming for, especially considering that the Commerce Department inflation gauge the central bank favors runs cooler than the Labor Department’s.<br />But with Covid-19 cases already down significantly from a month ago while millions of Americans are getting vaccinated each week, the pandemic’s hold on the country could be far looser by the time spring arrives. As people lower their caution levels and restrictions ease, spending on services such as travel and restaurants could surge. And people will have a substantial amount of money to spend.</td>

      <td>As Americans tee up in record numbers this winter, resorts and clubs—from Oregon to North Dakota—are offering warmer-than-usual welcomes, with heated golf carts, shorter courses and a lot of whiskey</td>
      <td>THIS TIME of year, many golfers swap rounds on the course for rounds on the couch, unless they’re heading to Florida or Arizona. But 2021 looks different: Thanks to milder temperatures in January and Americans’ persistent desire to get outside amid the continuing pandemic, golf courses around the country have been experiencing an unexpected boon. They’re also adapting to this hardier breed of duffers, offering a warmer-than-usual welcome via heated golf carts, shorter courses and expanded whiskey menus.<br />“What we’re seeing this winter, particularly in colder markets, is an extension of what we’ve experienced throughout 2020...more new people enjoying the game than we’ve seen in a long time,” said PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, a Boston native who’s always considered golf a year-round sport.<br />Golf’s inherently socially distanced nature is fueling its surge in popularity. Total rounds played in the U.S. in 2020 were up 37% in December year over year, according to the research firm Golf Datatech.<br />Lena Land, 50, and Grace Lapena, 64, are part of the motivated year-round golfing crew. The two friends are committed to playing golf every week at their home course of Brasada Canyons outside Bend, Ore. One dreary mid-January day, it rained for 90 minutes during their round, but they still finished 18 holes. Mrs. Land, who battled breast cancer last year, said she’s excited to feel healthy again and not about to let weather stop her. “They won’t let us on the course in the snow; otherwise we’d get colored balls and give it a try,” she said.<br />Other courses don’t mind a little frost. Elsewhere in Oregon, Silvies Valley Ranch, a golf and spa resort in Seneca opted to stay open through winter for only the second time and is offering a “cool golf” option ($45 per person). Guests use high-loft clubs, whose higher launch angle makes them easier to hit, and neon-green tennis balls, more readily spotted in the snow, so players can move briskly around a five-hole course. Each green is equipped with extra-large cups, introducing a new kind of putting challenge. Winter bookings at the Ranch are up more than 200% from last year.</td>

      <td>Facebook Inc.  said it is beginning to reduce how much political content users see in their news feeds, potentially diminishing the role that the world’s largest social network plays in elections and civil discourse more broadly.<br />The announcement, made in a Wednesday blog post, follows Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s declaration on the company’s earnings call last month that most users wanted to see less political content. He said at the time that cutting back on politics would allow Facebook to “do a better job of helping to bring people together and helping to promote healthier communities.”<br />Facebook says that political content currently constitutes only 6% of what people see on the platform. It will begin running experiments to reduce that amount for a small percentage of people in Canada, Brazil and Indonesia immediately, with tests in the U.S. in weeks to come.<br />The company said it isn’t removing political content but rather exploring ways to reduce the exposure for users who would prefer not to see it. In practice, that means Facebook will still allow users to post about politics and argue among friends, but its algorithms will de-prioritize those conversations and spread them less widely across the network, especially for people who have not expressed interest in those topics.<br />The company didn’t specify how it will define political content.</td>

      <td>The company has enjoyed a soaring stock-market valuation on the back of its EV plans, but peers are ahead with product launches</td>
      <td>In 2019, there was the United Auto Workers strike; in 2020, the pandemic lockdowns; and in 2021, a shortage of semiconductors. It is fortunate that investors have come to see General Motors as a growth stock, otherwise they might worry more about its meager cash flows.<br />The largest U.S. auto maker by sales said Wednesday that it expected the global microchip shortage to cost it between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion in free cash this year.  Ford  made a similar projection when it reported quarterly results last week. Combined with high capital spending, the problem will reduce GM’s adjusted automotive free cash flow to just $1 billion-to-$2 billion in 2021, according to its internal forecasts. Its shares sank 6% in morning trading.<br />Last year, the company generated automotive free cash flow of $2.6 billion. The pandemic lockdowns that closed factories across the world caused GM surprisingly little financial trauma across 2020 as a whole—by most metrics, less than the shutdowns caused by the 40-day strike the previous year. One reason for that resilience was a strong rebound in vehicle demand in its key U.S. market. Another was tight financial management, including delaying some capital spending.<br />The tab for capital expenditures in 2021 will be correspondingly larger: The company expects to fork out between $9 billion and $10 billion, up from just $5.3 billion in 2020 and a pre-pandemic $7.5 billion in 2019. Catch-up spending isn’t the only reason; GM also is accelerating investments in electric and driverless vehicles. Last month, it made headlines with an aspiration to phase out tailpipe emissions from its light-duty vehicles entirely by 2035.<br />The company has attracted huge attention and a soaring stock-market valuation with its bullish EV plans, but the big gap in its pitch to Wall Street is a cutting-edge EV in car showrooms. The first vehicles GM will launch on its much-hyped Ultium battery platform, the Hummer truck and the Cadillac Lyric, are both slated for the 2022 model year.</td>

      <td>President has moved to undo many of Trump’s immigration policies, but curb on program prized by employers remains in effect</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Business groups and immigrant advocates say they are worried that a ban imposed last year on most forms of legal immigration in response to the Covid-19 pandemic could stick even as President Biden undoes many of his predecessor’s other immigration policies.<br />The ban, which former President Donald Trumpput in place in April and expanded in June, was intended to block the entry of foreigners who might take open jobs while U.S. unemployment was soaring. It covers workers in a range of industries—from tech and consulting to landscaping and seasonal resorts—along with most family members of U.S. citizens looking to immigrate.<br />During the campaign, Mr. Biden criticized the ban several times, writing in one June tweet that it was “yet another attempt to distract” from the Trump administration’s pandemic response: “The President can’t scapegoat his way out of this crisis.”<br />Mr. Biden has signed executive orders halting construction of Mr. Trump’s border wall and ending a ban on travel from several countries, including a number of Muslim-majority nations, but he hasn’t mentioned the legal-immigration ban.<br />It is set to expire at the end of March if not renewed, but several industry representatives say that is too long to wait, given the impact the ban is having. Business groups that argued during the Trump administration that the ban disrupted companies’ operations and slowed the country’s economic recovery are now offering another objection.</td>

      <td>Coca-Cola  shares should be like a shaken bottle, ready to burst with effervescence later this year as economies around the world reopen. But now, new uncertainties from a tax controversy threaten to keep the stock on ice.<br />While at-home sales have remained strong, out-of-home sales in places like restaurants, bars and sports venues have plummeted. As a result, Coca-Cola has been hit much harder by the coronavirus pandemic than rival  PepsiCo ,  which has a huge snacking business well suited to the stay-at-home economy. Over the past year, Coca-Cola shares are down around 16%, compared with a 4% decline for Pepsi.<br />The flip side is that Coca-Cola’s sales are primed for a stronger rebound as vaccinations continue and economies reopen. The company reported Wednesday that organic sales declined 3% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, in line with analyst estimates, according to Visible Alpha. That was an improvement from the 26% and 6% declines in the second and third quarters, respectively.<br />It was especially encouraging that having previously declined to give guidance while citing “known unknowns” around the pandemic, the company is now comfortable enough to guide for organic sales growth in the high single digits in 2021.<br />But a new unknown has arisen: On Nov. 18, a U.S. Tax Court judge ruled that the company placed too much of its profit in its lower-tax foreign operations. The ruling didn’t determine how much the company owes, but the Internal Revenue Service had been seeking more than $3.3 billion for the tax years 2007 through 2009.</td>

      <td>The best present this year? A bright outlook. Let her see the world through rose-colored glasses and other translucent bits of blush.</td>
      <td>A LOT has changed since last Valentine’s Day. Co-quarantining couples have likely spent more time together than might seem wise, navigating everything from online-schooling to pod-defining to “Might we achieve a more profound understanding of ‘Schitt’s Creek’ if we stream all six seasons for the third time?’ Meanwhile, couples with separate living arrangements have dealt for the past year with their own decidedly unromantic logistics. In short, we could all use a pick-me-up, so this Valentine’s Day, forget the milk-vs-dark-chocolate dilemma of years past and give your loved one a rosy outlook. And we mean that quite literally. Below, 12 of our strategically uplifting picks, from rose-colored glasses (of both sun and wine varieties) to diaphanously pink luxe skincare and jewelry.<br />Perhaps too good for Zoom, this gauze-y, billowy sweater will brighten up any outfit—yes, including sweatpants. Sheer panels allow whatever hue you’re wearing underneath to peek through, and the accordion pleating throughout gives the cardigan an extra degree of swishy movement. Cardigan, $285, ph5.com<br />Skip the generic paper wrapping from the florist and deliver that bouquet of roses in a vaporous vase. Brooklyn artist Paul Arnhold makes one-of-a-kind glass blown vessels, like this one, that will transform any drab bedside table or workaday kitchen counter. An added bonus: When the petals inevitably begin to wilt, it will look just as good as a standalone piece. Vase, $200, paularnholdglass.com<br />These literally rose-colored glasses from luxe fashion house Alaïa will give everything in her life a peachy veneer—you included. (And let’s face it, after 11 months of quarantine cohabitating, that would probably benefit you both.) Plus, the oversize butterfly-shaped frames will add a welcome glint of “glam” to a half-masked face. Alaïa Sunglasses, $483, mytheresa.com<br />For the truly decadent Valentine, this 18-karat rose-gold necklace, handmade in Los Angeles and bejeweled from end to end, is sure to bring the “wow” factor. The dainty pink flowers—all 23 of them—comprise petals carved from pink tourmaline and radiant center stones, also of pink tourmaline. Necklace, $73,640, ireneneuwirth.com</td>
