      <td>Long before probes discovered the truth about Mars, stories about its inhabitants helped us understand the best and worst of humanity.</td>
      <td>This afternoon, NASA’s Perseverance rover will attempt to land on Mars, making it just the fifth vehicle on a planet about half the diameter of Earth. But compared with the eons of total emptiness until 1997, when NASA landed its first Mars rover, Sojourner, the neighborhood is getting pretty crowded. In fact, Perseverance is the third spacecraft to reach Mars just this month. On Feb. 9, the UAE’s Hope Probe arrived in orbit around Mars, where China’s Tianwen-1 joined it the very next day. In May or June, Tianwen will attempt to land its own rover on the Martian surface, making China the second country to achieve that feat.<br />The purpose of these missions is to study the composition of Mars’s soil and atmosphere. The one thing they’re certain not to find is what humanity long dreamed of finding on the red planet: an intelligent species with a civilization and technology comparable to our own. For almost a century, from the 1880s to the 1960s, Martians were humanity’s favorite shorthand for extraterrestrial life. Science fiction as a literary genre grew up with Martians, starting with H.G. Wells’s 1898 novel “The War of the Worlds,” about invaders from the red planet. So did the movies, which have used Mars as a showcase for special effects since Thomas Edison’s 1910 film “A Trip to Mars.” Martians were so popular in the early 20th century that the word itself now has a nostalgic feel, conjuring the past’s dream of a future that never came to be.<br />That humanity would fixate on Martians rather than Venusians or Saturnites wasn’t inevitable. Before the rise of modern astronomy, writers who imagined journeys to outer space generally picked the moon as a destination—naturally enough, since it’s far more conspicuous than Mars to the naked eye. The earliest such tale is the 2nd-century Greek work “A True Story,” in which the narrator’s ship is caught in a whirlwind and carried through the air for seven days and nights until it lands on the moon.<br />The shift to Mars as the most popular setting for space fantasy began in 1877, when the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli published a map of the planet that included features he called canali or “channels.” Schiaparelli didn’t believe these were artificial or carried water, but when canali was translated into English as “canals,” it was easy for readers to assume that they must be large-scale engineering projects—which meant that there must be Martians capable of building them.<br />No one did more to popularize this idea than the American astronomer Percival Lowell, who claimed to have observed even more detailed canal networks. In his 1906 book “Mars and Its Canals,” he argued that they were built by the inhabitants of Mars to transport water from the polar ice caps. The fact that the canals spanned the whole globe proved that Martians weren’t divided into warring nations, like us, but knew how to cooperate for the common good: “Whether increasing common sense or increasing necessity was the spur that drove the Martians to this eminently sagacious state we cannot say, but it is certain that reached it they have,” Lowell wrote.</td>

      <td>Top executives of Robinhood Markets Inc. and other firms that played a role in the  GameStop Corp.  saga will face questions from lawmakers Thursday after a group of online traders helped send shares of the videogame retailer surging earlier this year before the firm’s stock then crashed.<br />The House Financial Services Committee is holding the hearing on GameStop’s stock action, which raised questions about the integrity of the U.S. stock market and the pitfalls faced by individual investors in the age of social media and smartphone trading apps. The Securities and Exchange Commission and other authorities are investigating whether the episode calls for policy changes or was fueled by criminal misconduct such as market manipulation.<br />Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) has portrayed the hearing as a fact-finding mission aimed at verifying the popular account of what happened: A horde of individual investors sharing information on a Reddit forum poured money into GameStop shares, inflicting billions of dollars in losses on hedge funds that had bet against the stock.<br />Among those set to testify are Vladimir Tenev, chief executive of Robinhood, whose commission-free brokerage platform facilitated some of the viral trades; Kenneth Griffin, CEO of Chicago hedge-fund Citadel LLC and market maker Citadel Securities, which pays Robinhood to execute its users’ trades; and Gabriel Plotkin, CEO of a hedge fund that lost money during the episode. Also scheduled to appear are Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and Keith Gill, whose posts about GameStop helped fuel the rally.<br />As GameStop’s rise and fall brought arcane subjects such as stock-market plumbing, securities law and short selling into the public awareness, some lawmakers have scrambled to get up to speed.</td>

      <td>Tyson, Cargill suspend some meat processing; ranchers race to save newborn calves</td>
      <td>Brutal winter weather continued to batter the U.S. agriculture industry, as companies and farmers contended with snow, ice and cold temperatures that disrupted processing, snarled transport and killed livestock across the Midwest and South.<br />Winter storms are sowing challenges from Kansas to Alabama, state and industry officials said. Energy shortages forced meat-processing plants to temporarily close, while ice buildups kept grain barges off rivers and cattle ranchers struggled to save calves born onto frozen ground in the middle of the night.<br />The processing and transport disruptions, as well as the loss of animal life, are projected to cost agriculture companies and farmers millions of dollars. Farmers and state agriculture officials said it remained too early to tally all the costs.<br />“Mother Nature is a really tough business partner, and she has been pretty unforgiving here the past few days,” said Blayne Arthur, Oklahoma’s state agriculture commissioner.<br />The storm and its aftermath strained electrical grids, forcing rolling blackouts and the direction of natural gas supplies to residential homes. Natural gas constraints led Cargill Inc., one of the biggest U.S. beef processors, to shut down three Texas meat plants through Thursday, a spokesman said, and transportation difficulties slowed its grain and animal feed businesses elsewhere.</td>

      <td>Walmart Inc.  reported strong holiday sales and said it would raise wages for about 425,000 of its employees after a year in which the Covid-19 pandemic boosted its business.<br />U.S. comparable sales, or those from stores and digital channels operating for at least 12 months, rose 8.6% in the quarter ended Jan. 29, an acceleration from the third quarter, when sales climbed 6.4%, and higher than most analysts’ forecasts. U.S. e-commerce sales, which include online grocery orders, increased 69% from a year earlier.<br />The country’s largest private employer said it would raise pay for U.S. workers to an average above $15 an hour. Its minimum starting wage for U.S. workers will remain at $11 an hour.<br />The pay raises will be for store workers in digital and stocking roles, said Walmart U.S. Chief Executive John Furner. That targets roles that have been especially important during the pandemic, including workers that gather products from store shelves for online orders picked up in parking lots or delivered to homes. Walmart has worked to keep shelves stocked as shoppers stockpile certain items such as food and cleaning supplies.<br />“We saw major changes to customer behavior last year we believe will be lasting, and we have to continue working to stay in-stock, deliver items on time and provide the best omni experience possible,” said Mr. Furner.</td>

      <td>The European plane maker has delivered good results, given that 2020 was the worst year in aviation history</td>
      <td>Despite all the turbulence,  Airbus  stock may be flying a little too low.<br />On Thursday, the European plane maker’s shares dropped about 3% after Airbus announced that it expected to deliver at least 566 commercial aircraft this year—matching 2020 levels. This means that free cash flow for the year would roughly break even. Analysts had loftier expectations, and had penciled in a rise in deliveries that would generate positive cash flow of €500 billion, equivalent to $602 billion, in 2021, but extra travel restrictions this quarter are clouding the outlook.<br />It is a blow for investors, who are trained to look forward. Yet positive past performance shouldn’t be disregarded either, and Airbus’ results during the worst year in aviation history are encouraging.<br />For the year as a whole, the company lost €1.1 billion, which is actually less than in 2019, when losses amounted to €1.4 billion due to a €3.6 billion bribery-settlement fine. Crucially, Airbus turned a €1.6 billion profit in the fourth quarter, which is almost 60% above the median forecast compiled by FactSet.<br />Delivering 566 jets may not seem like a lot—that number was 863 in 2019—but it is close to heroic during a crisis that has grounded a third of the global airline fleet. Under such circumstances, there is little that carriers want to do less than spend cash to buy more planes.</td>

      <td>It has rarely been more expensive to move sugar, coffee and copper around the world by sea.<br />Ocean freight rates began to soar last summer, and haven’t let up. That is partly because consumers, unable to spend money in restaurants, have splashed out on goods that move by sea. Retailers and manufacturers, meanwhile, have rushed to rebuild inventories.<br />The shortage of 40-foot steel shipping containers has snarled global supply chains for commodities, hiking prices for some raw materials. That is of interest to investors and economists, who have been on the watch for signs of inflation after governments and central banks flooded markets with cash to bolster the pandemic-hit global economy. So far, there hasn’t been a big increase in consumer prices.<br />Trading houses, though, are feeling the pinch. Firms such as U.K.-based metals merchant RJH Trading Ltd. are paying lofty rates to secure berths on vessels. They face delays before loading cargoes at ports in Asia, where the dearth of boxes is most acute.<br />Normally, it takes RJH between 30 and 40 days to get tin and antimony, a silvery metal used in the electronics industry, from Asia to Europe, said managing director Charles Swindon. In recent months, RJH has waited for several weeks to find containers at ports in China, lengthening the journey time to 70 days. Freight costs are three to four times higher, he said.</td>

      <td>Ignoring global warming risks will bring costs, Fed governor says</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard said Thursday the economy and financial system are already being affected by climate change, and said the central bank is ramping up work to ensure the financial system can deal with the risks that lay ahead of it.<br />“Climate change is already imposing substantial economic costs and is projected to have a profound effect on the economy at home and abroad,” Ms. Brainard said in a text of a speech. “There is growing evidence that extreme weather events related to climate change are on the rise—droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, and heat waves are all becoming more common,” she said.<br />“Future financial and economic impacts will depend on the frequency and severity of climate-related events and on the nature and the speed at which countries around the world transition to a greener economy,” she said.<br />The official said financial firms should now begin a process of adapting to this reality, and while the change needed by firms will vary by institution, putting off the transition will come with increasing costs later. Firms will also need to take steps to ensure their activities don’t have a negative impact on the environment, she said.<br />Ms. Brainard’s speech Thursday comes as the central bank has started moving forward more aggressively with efforts to shore up the financial system amid clear evidence disruptive environmental events are starting to take a toll. Ms. Brainard’s speech reaffirmed that the Fed largely sees its climate change role as part of its oversight of financial firms.</td>

It was neither. After some early Osaka wobbles and some brief exuberance for Williams—maybe this really is going to be her tournament—Osaka recovered to seize control.

      <td>SYDNEY—Marcey Papandrea spent more than 10 years cultivating a small following on  Facebook  to draw people toward her website—called the Super Network—where she posts movie reviews and podcasts. On Thursday morning, she woke at home in Melbourne to find her Facebook page blocked.<br />Ms. Papandrea had become collateral damage in a dispute between Facebook Inc. and the Australian government over payment for content. Facebook overnight had followed through on a threat to bar users in Australia from posting news. The move also cut off access to information such as the national weather service and some local health sites, though Facebook said that had been done inadvertently.<br />“I have no idea what Facebook’s algorithm would be that someone like me would be targeted,” said Ms. Papandrea, 36 years old, who blamed both Facebook and the government for the outcome. “At the end of the day, this is like a mudslinging contest.”<br />Facebook opposes legislation by the Australian government that would effectively require big tech companies to pay the country’s media outlets for content. The legislation, which is being watched globally and could offer a model for other governments to follow, is working its way through the country’s parliament.<br />To Australian users, the Facebook pages belonging to media outlets in Australia and overseas—including The Wall Street Journal—appeared blank on Thursday with a message saying, “No posts yet.” Users who tried to post a link to a news article got a notification saying the post couldn’t be shared. Some people tried to find workarounds, such as posting screenshots of articles. Links could still be shared on Facebook’s instant-messaging platform.</td>

      <td>BEIJING—Chinese consumers opened up their wallets over the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, energizing a domestic retail and service sector that has proved a stubborn laggard in China’s economic recovery.<br />Consumption at major retailers and restaurants over the seven-day holiday, from Feb. 11 to Feb. 17, hit 821 billion yuan, China’s Commerce Ministry said Wednesday. That figure, equivalent to about $127 billion, represented a 29% jump from last year’s pandemic-disrupted holiday, and a 4.9% increase from the same period in 2019, long before the coronavirus swept across China.<br />The rise in spending came as tens of millions of Chinese residents heeded authorities’ call to stay put during the Lunar New Year holiday because of the coronavirus, denting what is traditionally the busiest travel season of the year. Instead, they redirected their disposable income to gifts, food, entertainment and other sectors that suffered during the height of the pandemic last year.<br />Monthly retail sales, a key gauge of consumption, only returned to year-over-year growth in August last year, becoming the last economic pillar to reclaim its pre-virus levels. But for 2020 as a whole, retail sales were still lower than 2019’s level. Beijing’s stimulus attempts during other public holidays last year failed to meaningfully boost consumption, in part because the efforts were too piecemeal, economists said.<br />This time around, authorities in various Chinese cities offered cash handouts and other incentives to remain in place after a resurgence of coronavirus cases began sweeping across northern China last month.</td>

As rich countries have done, Covax made deals with vaccine manufacturers to buy doses before they had passed clinical trials and been approved by drug regulators. The money to buy the vaccines has been donated mostly by Western governments and charitable groups, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.<br />Covax aims to provide free Covid-19 vaccines to at least 20% of the populations of the world’s 92 poorest countries by the end of 2021. Just over 50 other nations, including Canada and upper-middle income nations such as South Africa and Mexico, have also ordered vaccines through Covax, but have to pay for the doses themselves.<br />Covax has made deals with most of the big manufacturers, including  Pfizer Inc.,   Johnson & Johnson  and  Novavax Inc.  But during the first half of 2021, the majority of planned deliveries from the facility are for the vaccine developed by  AstraZeneca  PLC and Oxford University. For the whole year, the AstraZeneca vaccine is forecast to make up about one-third of Covax supplies, assuming that the shots by J&J and Novavax and other manufacturers get authorized as expected.<br />Covax says it has negotiated deals for about 2.27 billion doses of vaccines this year, although many are for shots that have yet to be authorized or are still in clinical trials. All vaccines, except the J&J one, require two doses and some of them will go to the self-financing countries.</td>

      <td>EU leaders pressured AstraZeneca to deliver more doses of its vaccine, but now find some people balk at the shot</td>
      <td>Health-worker unions in Europe say thousands of their members refuse to take one of the three Covid-19 vaccines available in the region because of concerns over efficacy and reports of side effects, the latest setback for the continent’s slow vaccine rollout.<br />Organizations representing health professionals across Europe said this week that doctors and nurses shouldn’t be forced to take the vaccine developed by  AstraZeneca  PLC because it was shown to offer less robust protection against Covid-19 than the other two currently authorized in the European Union. They also expressed concern over reports that the AstraZeneca vaccine appeared to cause stronger reactions in recipients.<br />Hospitals said hundreds of health professionals scheduled to get the vaccines hadn’t shown up for their appointments in recent days while many who had got the shot were calling in sick after reporting painful headaches, fever and other symptoms.<br />Politicians and scientists insisted this week that the AstraZeneca shot had been proven to work safely and that not using it would undermine the fight against the pandemic in Europe. The vaccine showed efficacy of around 62% in late-stage clinical trial results reported last year. Further data suggested the overall effectiveness was around 70%, if doses were spaced out longer. That compared with over 90% effectiveness in trials of competing vaccines. However, trials of all authorized vaccines, including AstraZeneca’s, found that they offered 100% protection from severe illness, hospitalizations and death.<br />A spokesman for AstraZeneca, which developed its vaccine with the University of Oxford, said: “Our vaccine has been authorized in more than 50 countries across four continents. There have been no confirmed serious adverse events associated with vaccination,” the spokesman said.</td>

      <td>Borrowed from the literary and film series and popularized by Thai protesters in 2014, the gesture has become a prominent symbol against this month’s coup in Myanmar</td>
      <td>SINGAPORE—As protests against a Feb. 1 military coup have gripped Myanmar, one symbol has emerged as an icon: the three-finger salute. Civil servants on strike, student protesters, even refugees living abroad have made the gesture in a show of defiance.<br />The sign has an unlikely origin story, popularized in the wake of a different coup, in 2014, in neighboring Thailand. Protesters there borrowed it from the literary and film series “The Hunger Games,” in which it is shown as a symbol for a fictional uprising against tyrannical overlords. Images of political activist Rittipong Mahapetch—flashing the sign at a busy Bangkok intersection against the backdrop of a pedestrian overpass crowded with soldiers—went viral just over a week after the Thai coup.<br />The spread of the salute shows how the region’s youth-led movements against authoritarianism, seeing their own struggles reflected abroad, have looked to one another for strategies, support and momentum as they face powerful opponents. Hong Kong’s decentralized protests against Chinese control became a model for recent Thai democracy demonstrators, who have for months challenged their country’s military-backed establishment. The hashtag #MilkTeaAlliance emerged as an online campaign through which Asian activists from Taiwan to Myanmar show solidarity with each other.<br />The governments they stand against are learning from each other, too, analysts and historians say.<br />“Activists are watching each other and trying to get ideas from each other, but at the same time authoritarian states are watching one another and trying to borrow their tricks,” said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a professor of history at University of California, Irvine and author of the book “Vigil: Hong Kong on the Brink.”</td>

      <td>Apollo Global Management Inc.  has appointed former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton to the newly created role of lead independent director on its board, the latest step in a sweeping overhaul of corporate governance at the investment firm.<br />Mr. Clayton, who stepped down from his role at the SEC in December, will also return to Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, where he was a partner before entering government, according to an announcement planned for Thursday. He will be senior policy adviser and of counsel at that law firm.<br />At Apollo, Mr. Clayton, who is well regarded on Wall Street, will join a firm that is in transition following revelations of ties between Chief Executive Leon Black and the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. An independent review by the law firm Dechert LLP revealed that Mr. Black paid Epstein a total of $158 million for tax- and estate-planning services, far more than was previously known.<br />It found no evidence that Mr. Black was involved in the criminal activities of Epstein, who was indicted in 2019 on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls and later killed himself in jail.<br />Mr. Black last month said he would step down as Apollo CEO by the time he turns 70 in July, ceding the role to co-founder Marc Rowan. Mr. Black, who will remain chairman, recommended that the board appoint more independent directors and move to eliminate Apollo’s dual-class share structure.</td>

      <td>LONDON— Barclays  PLC posted a profit in 2020 as buoyant securities trading made up for a lackluster performance in the U.K., where the bank expects pent-up savings to give the economy a boost as the coronavirus pandemic wanes.<br />Net profit at the London-based bank fell 38% from a year earlier to £1.53 billion, equivalent to $2.12 billion. Profit at Barclays’s corporate and investment bank rose 29% to £2.55 billion.<br />Barclays shares traded 2% lower on the results. The bank said it intends to pay a dividend for 2020 and buy back up to £700 million of shares. The proposed dividend of one pence a share was less than some investors were expecting.<br />The results support the strategy of Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley, who has fended off demands from activist investor Edward Bramson to scale back the investment bank. Mr. Bramson’s Sherborne Investors says it owns 5.8% of Barclays. European lenders with large securities-trading units, such as Deutsche Bank AG and BNP Paribas SA, have fared better in the pandemic.<br />Barclays is the U.K.’s second-largest lender by assets after  HSBC Holdings  PLC, operating a large domestic retail and commercial bank as well as a trans-Atlantic investment bank that competes with the likes of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  Morgan Stanley .</td>

Rowe Price Group Inc.  and  Invesco Ltd.  are among the firms that have recently introduced semitransparent active ETFs, which combine features of mutual funds and traditional ETFs. The funds, which currently focus on U.S. stocks, are cheaper alternatives to mutual funds and give portfolio managers the chance to try to beat the market without running the risk of being copied or front-run. But they don’t disclose their daily holdings the way other ETFs do.<br />The funds have received a chilly reception so far from  Bank of America Corp. ,  UBS Group AG  and  Wells Fargo  & Co., which haven’t yet offered them to their wealth-management clients. Some bank executives say the strategy requires further scrutiny and a study of the funds’ long-term performance.<br />That has left the initial wave of fund launches cut off from a crucial source of support: BofA, UBS and Wells together manage more than $6 trillion in assets through their wealth-management divisions.<br />“It’s a process and a lot of work. We just don’t want to offer a lot of new products,” said Sandy Bolton, head of managed investments of Bank of America’s investment solutions group, of the approval process. “In this case, it’s in the best interest of clients.”</td>

      <td>Just a few weeks ago, Fernando Tatís Jr. didn’t want to talk much about his future. Asked about the possibility of signing a long-term extension with the San Diego Padres, he deflected.<br />“I’m not going to say much, but I’d love to stay in San Diego,” Tatís said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. “Hopefully we can work it out.”<br />Suffice it to say they did just that—and it will result in Tatís signing the longest contract in baseball history.<br />Tatís, the 22-year-old shortstop widely viewed as baseball’s brightest young star, agreed to a 14-year deal with the Padres worth $340 million Wednesday night, possibly tying himself to San Diego for most or all of his career. In terms of total dollars, Tatís’s deal ranks third all-time, trailing only Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts (12 years, $365 million) and Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout (10 years, $360 million).<br />In one crucial way, Tatís’s contract stands alone. Betts inked his pact at the age of 27, with six strong seasons for the Boston Red Sox and a MVP award on his résumé. Trout had already established himself as the undisputed best player on the planet when he signed his deal to remain in Anaheim the rest of his professional life.</td>

Low share prices allow small-time traders to more easily accumulate stakes and can sometimes signify cheap valuations. Share prices of lightly traded stocks can more easily be pushed higher or lower than shares of stocks that are more frequently traded.<br />Big companies with high stock prices and volume—like the third-most-mentioned company last year, Apple Inc.—tend to be unswayed by what happens on the message board, according to Hudson Cashdan, co-founder of TopStonks.com, a website that tracks equities mentioned on Reddit.<br />The success stories often share common traits with stocks selected by pros.

Central bankers and finance ministries have opened the cash sluices, and what looks like a speculative boom is under way in many corners of global financial markets. But over the past 12 months, the yellow metal—the original darling of skeptics of spendthrift governments—has underperformed the S&P 500.<br />At a bit below $1,800 a troy ounce, gold prices are far below the highs of around $2,050 reached in early August.<br />Watching bitcoin hit $50,000, SoftBank’s stock price surpass its dot-com boom high and even silver catch a bid from retail traders must be particularly difficult for holders of gold. Many had expected that the original speculative asset would prosper under the unusual market conditions of the past year.<br />Bank of America  commodity analysts announced an 18-month gold price target of $3,000 in April, before paring it back later in 2020. That forecast was made on the reasonable-seeming assumption that the bulging balance sheets of major central banks and huge fiscal rescue packages would be a boost to the asset most traditionally favored by investors worried about government profligacy.<br />But it simply hasn’t worked out that way. The metal’s recent performance should be confirmation, if any were really needed, that buyers of gold are really just buying inflation-protected government bonds under a different name. Since 2005, the yield on 10-year TIPS—inflation indexed U.S. government bonds—has had an R-squared relationship of 0.81 with the daily price of gold, meaning the moves in one explain the majority of moves in the other.</td>

He said the contracts called for compliance with environmental safeguards.<br />When The Wall Street Journal reported on the investigation into suspected dumping in 2019, Kanto Kosan denied any wrongdoing.

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s allies are preparing to create a new nonprofit advocacy organization, with the White House’s approval, that will be funded by donors and seek to build support for his policy agenda, senior administration officials said.<br />The nonprofit, whose working name is “Building Back Together,” is expected to run advertisements promoting the president’s policies and coordinate with existing nonprofit advocacy organizations on issues such as Covid-19, climate change and the economy.<br />White House officials won’t directly oversee the nonprofit, but senior Biden officials have been involved in discussions about its structure and have chosen a group of Biden campaign veterans and allies to establish it. The officials said Mr. Biden and senior White House advisers have been briefed on the planning.<br />Anita Dunn, a White House senior adviser and top campaign aide, said the nonprofit will work with existing advocacy organizations to try to build coalitions of support.<br />“This is not to replicate. It is not to duplicate,” Ms. Dunn said, but will work with those existing groups.</td>

      <td>An electricity grid that relies on renewables also needs nuclear or coal power.</td>
      <td>While millions of Texans remain without power for a third day, the wind industry and its advocates are spinning a fable that gas, coal and nuclear plants—not their frozen turbines—are to blame. PolitiFact proclaims “Natural gas, not wind turbines, main driver of Texas power shortage.” Climate-change conformity is hard for the media to resist, but we don’t mind. So here are the facts to cut through the spin.<br />Texas energy regulators were already warning of rolling blackouts late last week as temperatures in western Texas plunged into the 20s, causing wind turbines to freeze. Natural gas and coal-fired plants ramped up to cover the wind power shortfall as demand for electricity increased with falling temperatures.<br />Some readers have questioned our reporting Wednesday ("The Political Making of a Texas Power Outage") that wind’s share of electricity generation in Texas plunged to 8% from 42%. How can that be, they wonder, when the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot) has reported that it counts on wind to meet only 10% of its winter capacity.<br />Ercot’s disclosure is slippery. Start with the term “capacity,” which means potential maximum output. This is different than actual power generation. Texas has a total winter capacity of about 83 megawatts (MW) including all power sources. Total power demand and generation, however, at their peak are usually only around 57 MW. Regulators build slack into the system.<br />Texas has about 30,000 MW of wind capacity, but winds aren’t constant or predictable. Winds this past month have generated between about 600 and 22,500 MW. Regulators don’t count on wind to provide much more than 10% or so of the grid’s total capacity since they can’t command turbines to increase power like they can coal and gas plants.</td>

      <td>Oil’s recent rise above $60 a barrel will test the willpower of shale companies that pledged to slow drilling and repair balance sheets battered by the pandemic.<br />The highest prices since January 2020 have given U.S. drillers an unexpected opening to invest in oil patches considered unworkable just a few months ago. Some, such as  Devon Energy Corp. , have begun to loosen the purse strings as the market improves.<br />For now, though, many frackers are unable to take advantage of the rally as they work to restore as much as roughly one-third of the nation’s oil production. The winter storm that left millions without power this week knocked out as much as 2.5 million barrels a day in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford of Texas and one million in other oil-rich states, traders estimated.<br />Icy roads have blocked service crews from reaching wells, and analysts estimated the disruptions could affect production through March. It will take weeks to determine exactly how many barrels will have been lost to the storm, Devon Chief Executive Richard Muncrief said.<br />In earnings calls this week, shale executives said they are sticking to capital discipline, which has become a mantra of the industry following a yearslong push by investors.</td>

      <td>Classical Western values such as free speech and tolerance need all the defenders they can find these days, so kudos to French President Emmanuel Macron for volunteering for the mission. It’s hardly an easy task, but it’s an important one. Mr. Macron is right to conclude it’s vital to France’s future—and we'd add, to America’s.<br />Mr. Macron and ministers in his government in recent months have been fighting illiberal and divisive philosophies they say emanate from American universities. Mr. Macron in October decried the influence of “certain social-science theories entirely imported from the United States.”<br />He means in particular the habit of viewing most matters in racial terms—a core tenet of “wokeness”—and his government wants educational institutions to eschew it. Minister for Higher Education Frédérique Vidal this week promised an investigation into academics “looking at everything through the prism of wanting to fracture and divide.”<br />This is part of a broader drive to reassert French values after many years of Islamist terror attacks. Mr. Macron also is pushing for a new crackdown on religious extremism, and his law to that end passed through one chamber of the National Assembly this week.<br />Mr. Macron’s political and philosophical insight is to tie together the fight against violent extremism from outside France and the defense of democratic values within. His October speech detailing his new plan for combating Islamism included a warning that a focus on “post-colonial or anti-colonial” discourse constitutes a form of “self-hatred” of France that allows Islamism to flourish. Officials such as Ms. Vidal also warn against “Islamo-leftism.”</td>

      <td>Democrat are selling a $1.9 trillion spending bill as a Covid relief measure, but buried in the fine print are policy choices far removed from the pandemic, such as a $22 billion tax increase on multinational companies.<br />Daniel Bunn, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, has the details. When a U.S. company with foreign subsidiaries does its taxes, it attributes some of its interest expense to its overseas income. But that allocation might not reflect reality if the divisions abroad also take out their own debt.<br />“This could get to the point,” Mr. Bunn wrote last week, “that the company’s foreign tax credits do not accurately reflect taxes paid, resulting in double taxation.”<br />In 2004 Congress passed a law, which took effect this year, that allows interest allocations on a “worldwide basis,” meaning they might even flow from the subsidiary to the parent company, “depending on the level of expenses and where income is earned,” Mr. Bunn writes. “This allows better alignment of expenses and income for the purpose of calculating foreign tax credits.” The House version of the latest Covid-19 relief bill would permanently eliminate this provision.<br />Taxation of multinationals is complex, and the point here isn’t to defend every jot and tittle of the current internal revenue code. But this tweak is a tax increase, period. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will raise $22.3 billion in revenue through 2031. That’s also why this improvement to the tax code that passed Congress in 2004, the year  Facebook  was founded and before the iPhone existed, spent a decade and a half in limbo: It was repeatedly delayed by lawmakers scrounging for cash.</td>

After a seven-month, 292-million-mile journey, NASA’s biggest, fastest and brainiest rover ever—Perseverance—is nearing its highly anticipated touchdown on the Red Planet.<br />The $2.7 billion rover, which is scheduled to land at 3:55 p.m. EST on Thursday, embodies the latest and most ambitious effort by NASA to find evidence of past life on Mars. Though it is now a barren place of icy dunes, dust devils, dead volcanoes and subzero winds, scientists believe Mars in its remote past may have been a comparatively lush, warm world—one suitable for the chemistry of life.<br />“It will attempt to answer an age-old question that has eluded humanity for generations: whether life has ever existed elsewhere beyond our own planet,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the space agency’s science mission directorate in Washington, said of the Perseverance mission.<br />Bristling with sensors, cameras, microphones and a robotic arm, the one-ton, SUV-size Perseverance rover is designed to look for rock or soil specimens that might harbor evidence of ancient life and pack what it finds into small tubes, to be cached for retrieval by future missions and brought back to Earth for analysis. NASA and the European Space Agency are discussing several mission scenarios that might return these samples by 2031, NASA officials said.<br />During its two-year mission, Perseverance will roam the surface and look for traces of organic matter, which could be evidence of primordial microbes or other simple life-forms. Other places in the solar system—from the searing clouds of Venus to the frozen oceans of moons around Jupiter and Saturn—might also have the potential for life. But those places are considered even more inaccessible than Mars.</td>

      <td>Some economists warn about too much spending, but too little could hurt the economy more.</td>
      <td>A big tempest is brewing in a big teapot over President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan. Republican objections are to be expected. But some of the objections come from nominally Democratic economists, led by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. This is a surprise.<br />The Biden plan isn’t perfect. But with today’s enormous uncertainties, no one can possibly know what the “right” plan really is.<br />Here’s an analogy. I recently listened to a wonderful scientific seminar. At one point, a scientist who was obviously very knowledgeable about vaccines asked a scientist from the pharmaceutical industry how researchers had decided on the dosage in each shot (which struck him as large) and the interval between the first and second shots (which struck him as short).<br />I’ll paraphrase the answer: We were in the middle of a pandemic. We didn’t want to take any chances of underdosing people, and we wanted to get vaccines into people’s arms fast. That response both acknowledged the huge scientific uncertainties and displayed a keen sense of how asymmetric the risks were. Underdosing and waiting too long between shots meant more sickness and death. Overdosing and giving second shots at shorter intervals did not.<br />That is not unlike designing an economic relief program. No one knows either the exactly correct dosage or the precisely correct timing. Only history will judge whether the program was too small or too big—and even then with much guesswork. But the risks in each direction are not symmetric.</td>

      <td>China is funding massive projects all over the world, and gaining influence. The U.S. can do the same.</td>

But in defining America's future national strategy, the new administration should take this process a step further.<br />China’s long-term strategy stretches beyond the issues of trade policy, great power rivalry, nuclear proliferation and military expansion. Largely unexamined in the public debate is China’s pursuit of massive infrastructure projects in developing countries, where it seeks to cement long-term relations. These economic and diplomatic ties are an extension of power—with China’s military and security involvement justified as necessary to protect its interests.<br />China seeks to be the world’s most powerful country, and its Belt and Road Initiative is an important component of its strategy. As a safeguard to our diplomatic and economic health the U.S. should recalibrate its own approach to often ignored nations, even as we continue to meet the more traditional national security challenges that dominate the headlines.<br />Much of the world is becoming uneasy with China’s unremitting aggression on its home turf in Asia. Over the past decade China has been calling its own shots, rejecting international law and public opinion while signaling that it intends to replace the U.S. as the region’s dominant military, diplomatic and economic power. Beijing has taken down Hong Kong’s democracy movement; started military spats with India; disrupted life for tens of millions by damming the headwaters of the Mekong River; conducted what the U.S. government now deems a campaign of genocide against Muslim Uighurs; escalated tensions with Japan over the Senkaku Islands; consolidated its illegal occupation of islands in the South China Sea; and made repeated bellicose gestures designed to test the international community’s resistance to “unifying” the “renegade province” of Taiwan.<br />While any of these and similar moves could expand into major crises, they already have raised suspicions across the international community. The BRI has to date remained a separate matter, but the cumulative effect of Beijing’s relentless provocations has given pause to many of China’s third-world partners in economic development.</td>

Perhaps unsurprisingly, we became fast friends. He’s earned the nickname “Sunshine” among my friend group for his positive disposition and, like the character in “Remember the Titans,” his wholesome good looks.<br />Our shared interests came up again last month as Sunshine and I chatted while running together. I admitted that while my love of Jerry and Bob hadn’t waned, I had fallen out of the habit of saying the prayer that once brought me such calm. “Funny,” he said. “It was your sticker that first challenged me to up my game.” We jogged on in silence, and I didn’t think much more of the exchange.<br />Two weeks later, Sunshine found me in the narthex of our church right before Sunday Mass. There he pressed into my palm a handmade set of rosary beads he’d ordered for me. I was surprised because I hadn’t asked for them; not verbally, anyway. It was just his way of doing me a good turn.</td>

      <td>In the early 1980s, dressed in a bespoke dark velvet three-piece suit and ruffled white silk shirt, my young English friend met me for dinner at the prestigious 21 Club restaurant. He was detained at the door. Where was his tie? After a brief discussion, a 21 Club tie, festooned with jockeys, was draped over the ruffles and we were escorted to Siberia. Richard Thompson Ford calls that 21 Club tie a “badge of shame.”<br />There are many badges of shame recorded in “Dress Codes,” a sharp and entertaining history of the rules of fashion. In his introduction Mr. Ford, a Stanford law professor and cultural critic, writes that he learned his sense of style from his father, a trained tailor and an ordained minister. “For years my dad endured my sartorial misadventures (asymmetrical ‘new-wave’ haircuts, nylon parachute pants, the ‘punk’ look, which consisted of deliberately torn garments held together with safety pins or duct tape) in quiet despair.” In the end the author followed his father’s example and came to appreciate the virtues of tailored suits, polished dress shoes and crisp shirts. So much so that in 2009 he decided to enter Esquire magazine’s Best Dressed Real Man contest.<br />Among the book’s illustrations is a snapshot of the author in a smart pinstripe suit, his arms around his squirming daughter. It helped Mr. Ford gain sixth place in the contest, but he blew the interview. “I knew intuitively why I wore what I did, but I could not explain it to save my life.”<br />“Dress Codes” is his belated but eloquent response. In a jam-packed, fact-filled survey, Mr. Ford skillfully examines how fashion, far from being mere frivolity, has shaped people’s lives from the 14th century to the present. His wide-ranging research is punctuated with quotations from such cultural observers as the semiotician Roland Barthes, designer Miuccia Prada (who like Barthes saw fashion as “a wearable language”), historian Anne Hollander and economist Thorstein Veblen.<br />Joan of Arc was one of history’s first fashion victims, burned at the stake for heresy. Among her crimes: the wearing of men’s clothes. In some 15th-century Italian cities, Christian women were forbidden to wear earrings (symbols of sin), while for Jewish women it was compulsory. During the Renaissance, sumptuous attire—furs, velvet, silks—was a way of asserting social dominance, and sumptuary laws kept upstarts in their place.</td>

      <td>Millions of Americans remained without power for a third consecutive day, as another winter storm began blanketing parts of the South with more snow and freezing rain.<br />The new storm, which will move toward the East Coast later this week, will prolong icy conditions in some areas hit earlier this week by an Arctic blast of subzero temperatures and snow, according to the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center.<br />Predictions show snowfall of four inches and above from Oklahoma to the mid-Atlantic region, with Pennsylvania potentially seeing eight inches or more later this week. “Significant freezing rain is also likely from Texas to Tennessee and North Carolina to Virginia,” the weather service said on  Twitter ,  adding that parts of Texas, Mississippi and the Mid-Atlantic could accumulate swaths of ice a half-inch thick.<br />Hazardous weather will move into the Florida panhandle and the Carolinas on Thursday, including the possibility of tornadoes, the NWS warned. Ahead of the storm, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued a state of emergency, which will allow for quicker repairs to downed lines and other utility issues.<br />“This forecast for icy weather is a real threat for widespread power outages,” the Democrat said Wednesday. “People need to be ready to stay home and be prepared to lose power for a while.”</td>

      <td>After running as a moderate, he now promotes unlimited government spending.</td>
      <td>If any media folk are still interested in “fact-checking” presidents after the Trump era, they’ll have plenty of fodder from Tuesday night’s appearance by President Joe Biden on CNN. A favorite Biden habit is to appeal to the authority of economists, many of whom remain unnamed, to suggest that his policies are wildly popular among experts. And what would we do without anonymous experts?<br />Newsweek has a transcript of the event in which CNN’s Anderson Cooper hosted our 46th president at Milwaukee’s Pabst Theater. Here’s an excerpt:<br />Thank goodness this statement is not accurate. There is not an “overwhelming consensus” among economists that no amount of federal spending is excessive. This column is often skeptical of conventional expert opinion. But even for those who aren’t, the Biden economic plan is notable for the way it has drawn criticism not just from economists in the center and on the right but from Mr. Biden’s own former colleagues on the left. Many of the critiques specifically warn that he is indeed spending too much taxpayer money on a recovering economy which does not need another massive intervention.<br />Last month this column noted the criticism of Bidenomics from veterans of the Obama economic team. More recently one of the Biden plan’s enthusiastic backers also acknowledged the resistance coming from liberal economists. John Cassidy wrote in the New Yorker:<br />One can usually count on massive federal programs to be counterproductive, such as the one Mr. Biden helped oversee as Vice President in 2009 and which he reasonably described on Tuesday as “the last experiment we had with stimulus.” Unreasonably for taxpayers, the experiment failed as the plan burned through more than $800 billion and failed miserably to reach its employment goals.</td>

Mr. Kim also has said the Cuomo administration was engaged in a coverup related to nursing-home deaths.<br />“He attacked me and said that I obstructed justice in a letter today,” Mr. Cuomo said of Mr. Kim. “He said today that the immunity bill was because of my political contributors. Those are very harsh accusations.”<br />“If you don’t correct the disinformation, it perpetuates,” Mr. Cuomo added.<br />The governor has come under fire from Democratic and Republican leaders following the disclosure that his administration didn’t fully release information regarding Covid-19 deaths in the state’s nursing homes out of its fear that former President Trump’s administration would politicize the information. That concern prompted the Cuomo administration to withhold information from state lawmakers regarding how many nursing-home residents died from the virus after they were transferred to hospitals, citing the continuing probe by the U.S. Department of Justice.</td>

And vaccinating an entire town will counter Brazil’s growing anti-vax movement and demonstrate the wider benefits of mass immunization, such as a quick economic recovery expected with a fast reopening of Serrana.<br />“It will give us information about the percentage of people who need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity—no one knows this yet,” said Marcos Borges, a professor of medicine at the University of São Paulo in nearby Ribeirão Preto who is leading the study.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats are bracing for an internal battle over raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, as they grappled with the political and procedural constraints on reaching a long-held goal of the party’s progressive wing.<br />Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan proposes to do by 2025, faces opposition from some Democratic lawmakers and parliamentary hurdles. Democrats cannot afford to lose a single vote in the 50-50 Senate on the relief package, which also calls for sending many Americans a $1,400 direct check, bolstering federal unemployment aid, and offering funds for vaccine distribution and testing.<br />At a CNN town hall event on Tuesday, Mr. Biden floated the possibility of raising the minimum wage to $12 or $13 an hour by 2025, rather than $15.  “I do support a $15 minimum wage,” Mr. Biden said. “But that’s a debatable issue.”<br />Press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday Mr. Biden continues to back the $15 wage but noted his aid proposal “included many other components.” She added that the legislation “may not look the same way when it comes out of the sausage-making machine” in Congress.<br />While many Republicans have assailed the proposed wage increase, arguing that it would hurt small businesses and cost jobs, Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Tuesday they would soon introduce their own legislation to raise the minimum wage. The two Republicans said they would pair the gradual wage increase with a requirement that employers verify the immigration status of their employees—likely a nonstarter with Democrats. The pair haven’t yet specified what level they would raise the wage.</td>

      <td>A familiar voice in American media and politics has gone quiet. Rush Limbaugh, the most listened-to radio host in America for 30 years, died Wednesday at age 70.<br />We recall how bracing the Rush Limbaugh Show was in its early days. For decades the airwaves had been governed by the Fairness Doctrine, a federal regulation requiring stations to balance “controversial” claims with “contrasting viewpoints.” The rule gave incumbent candidates and mainstream news outlets a near-monopoly on public discourse. Ronald Reagan scrapped the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. By the 1992 presidential campaign, the radio star’s first name was known across the U.S.<br />Limbaugh, whose show ran on weekdays from noon to 3 p.m. East Coast time, was invaluable to the conservative movement in the 1990s. He would spend an hour explaining supply-side tax policy or making the case for deregulation. Millions of Americans had never heard a coherent argument against the welfare state or Roe v. Wade until they tuned in to Limbaugh’s show. He played an enormous role in popularizing conservative ideas and policies.<br />His critics called him a racist and about everything else, which was always unfair. His real offense was to gain millions of weekly listeners by mocking the left’s pieties. He dissected environmental scare campaigns, and he ridiculed the news media for finding epidemics of homelessness only during Republican administrations. In 1994 Bill Clinton called the show from Air Force One to complain about the host’s criticisms—not for the last time blaming scrappy radio hosts for his own political woes.<br />In recent years, with the rise of more acerbic competitors and a general souring of public discourse, Limbaugh took on a more exasperated tone. He also moved to the Trumpian right on issues such as trade, immigration and foreign policy.</td>

The directors’ departure could be announced as soon as Wednesday, this person said.<br />Mr. Collins, former chief executive of medical device-maker  Medtronic PLC ,  has been a Boeing board member since 2007. Ms. Schwab, a former U.S. trade representative, has been on the board since 2010.<br />The departures have been under consideration in recent weeks and are part of a longer-term push to bring new directors onto the board in the aftermath of the MAX crisis, some of the people familiar with the matter said. Four members of the expected 10-member board will have been added after the accidents.<br />Boeing’s board has faced scrutiny from investors and U.S. lawmakers ever since two of its 737 MAX jets crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, claiming 346 lives. A year ago, the board added two new directors with safety and engineering experience as two longtime members stepped down. Since the accidents, Boeing’s board has also added a permanent safety committee and split the roles of chairman and chief executive.</td>

      <td>Jackson Hole and other popular ski resorts in the West are up and running with varying Covid rules and limitations. For purists, that’s not such a bad thing.</td>
      <td>ON A RECENT Wednesday at noon, I stood in the middle of Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, peering over my skis at the run below us. At big resorts that time of day, every last new snowflake has usually been flattened by legions of skiers streaming off the lifts. But the trail below me, which dropped away at a perfect pitch between pine trees and cliffs, looked strangely pristine. It was clear that only a few people had skied here that morning.<br />Though my boyfriend, Andrew, and I, both zealous skiers, live just a few miles from Jackson Hole, with the Covid-19 pandemic still raging, we’d avoided the major commercial ski areas this winter in favor of the wide-open spaces of backcountry and Nordic skiing. But we were curious to see how the big ski resorts were managing the crowds a few months in and how the crowds were managing all the new Covid precautions. As we approached Jackson Hole that morning, our first impression wasn’t favorable: A line of cars with plates from Texas to Massachusetts crawled along the entrance road, waiting to enter the parking lot. Barely past 9 a.m., even on a weekday, all lots were close to full, usually indicating miserably long lift lines.<br />Next up was a five-minute bus ride in a shuttle designed to accommodate 45 people but limited to a maximum of 25. Plastered everywhere inside were signs requiring skiers to wear masks and our fellow passengers respected the dictate, save one man who stonily ignored a request from another skier to pull up his mask.<br />At the ticket office, we quickly picked up the prepaid passes we’d ordered online. But our hearts sank at the sight of the lift lines. The wait for the tram, limited to 25 riders instead of the normal 100, easily looked like a two-hour ordeal. We bypassed that crowd and trudged up a slight hill, bombarded by more signs and banners laying out resort-wide Covid rules and mask-required areas. Even though my mask was compromising my oxygen intake after the exertion and I longed to tear it off, the signs shamed me into lightheaded gasping instead.<br />The line at the next lift looked worryingly sardine can-like, but as we got closer, we saw that its snaking nature had made the widely spaced skiers appear more congested than they were. In the end, we only waited 15 minutes. Still, to minimize the time languishing on long lift-lines at the base, we headed to the upper mountain lifts, which had much shorter waits. To avoid dining indoors, we had picked up burritos from D.O.G. in town and tucked them into our pockets for lunch on the lift.</td>

Taylor and his son Peter M. Taylor sent a letter early this month to Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking for a delay of 30 to 60 days for the new administration to take a look at whether the pair should be extradited, according to a copy of the letter viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The State Department has the final say in extradition cases, which are considered diplomatic matters. The Trump-era State Department had cleared the Taylors’ extradition. The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday declined to take up the case, marking the end of any legal appeals.<br />If U.S. officials decide to proceed with the extradition, the Taylors’ lawyers asked the State Department to put conditions on the surrender, including that the nine months the Taylors served in a U.S. jail count towards any prison sentence they might receive in Japan. The letter also requests that the Taylors serve any Japanese prison sentence in the U.S. or a U.S. military detention facility in Japan.<br />The Taylors at minimum have requested a delay in extradition until at least Feb. 25, the day after they are scheduled to receive their second Covid-19 vaccine, according to Paul V. Kelly, one of their attorneys. There is a Covid-19 outbreak at the Norfolk County jail near Boston where the Taylors have been held since U.S. authorities arrested them in May at the request of Japanese officials.</td>

      <td>Vanderbilt University heads this list from the WSJ/THE College Rankings</td>
      <td>Vanderbilt University is the highest-ranked school in the South for academic resources, at No. 6 nationwide for this category of the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings.  Rice University is a close second in the region for resources, at No. 7 nationally.<br />Resources account for 30% of a school’s overall score in the WSJ/THE rankings.  Forty percent of each school’s overall score comes from student outcomes, including measures of graduate salaries and debt burdens, 20% from how well it engages its students and 10% from its environment, a measure of its diversity. The resources score is based on how much a school spends per student on teaching, the ratio of students to faculty and the number of published scholarly research papers per faculty member.<br />In addition to Vanderbilt and Rice, three other Southern schools made the top 20 nationwide for academic resources: Johns Hopkins University at No. 11, Duke University at No. 14 and Emory University at No. 19.  All five of the Southern schools in the top 20 for resources are also in the top 25 nationally in the overall ranking, led by Duke University at No. 5 overall.<br />See the full list of top Southern schools for resources below.

      <td>Unusually cold Texas weather is both good and bad for oil refiners as margins get a boost, but some are unable to capitalize</td>
      <td>The massive oil-and-gas complex along the U.S. Gulf Coast is built with extreme weather in mind—just not this kind. Bitter cold and resulting blackouts have shut in more production and refining capacity than any recent hurricane, delivering a windfall for some companies with the right assets in the right place.<br />Oil prices usually fall when refiners shut down unexpectedly—they are, after all, the only customer—but both U.S. crude supply and demand are being pinched. The picture is more bullish for the fuels refiners churn out. More than 3 million barrels a day of crude oil production, or about 27% of the total, have been affected, according to Raymond James, while about 18% of refining capacity has been shut. Front-month gasoline futures hit their highest level since October 2018 on Wednesday.<br />The crack spread, the difference between gasoline prices and crude oil, was up 5.13%, according to Robert Yawger, energy futures analyst at Mizuho Securities. That means higher profits for refiners still up and running.<br />Independent refiners, so badly battered by the pandemic, have seen a bump. The biggest gainers include shares of  PBF Energy  and  CVR Energy ,  both up by about a fifth compared with a week ago. Around 82% of PBF Energy’s total refining capacity is outside the Gulf Coast area. Other refiners with mixed footprints, such as  HollyFrontier Corp.  and  Valero ,  also have seen gains.<br />It isn’t clear how long the windfall will last and what the net benefit will be. For those that had to shut off substantial Gulf Coast refining capacity, a longer shutdown could just erase temporary profits. Meanwhile, market forces are at work. Mr. Yawger notes that European buyers have been purchasing crude oil to refine and export it to the U.S. as fast as they can. U.S. gasoline imports rose 20% this week compared with a week earlier, according to S&P Global Platts.</td>

      <td>Thrifty, functional tickers by brands like Timex and Swatch have become highly desirable—and it’s not just because John Mayer collaborated with Casio</td>
      <td>ONE OF THE more seriously sought-after watches released last year was the $180  Casio  G-Shock Ref. 6900 digital ticker made in collaboration with the musician John Mayer and the watch blog Hodinkee. Hodinkee is the sort of site that attracts horological fanatics who could spend hours ravenously reading up on the idiosyncrasies of different Omega reissues or uber-rare Swiss-made watches about to hit the auction block. These wonks regularly lust after four- or even five-figure timepieces, yet the modest Mayer G-Shock seduced them. (Tellingly, Hodinkee followed it up with a $14,400 Swiss dive watch by Blancpain.) When the limited-edition G-Shocks were released in December, they sold out in under 15 minutes. Like a rare pair of Nikes, the watch is still being flipped on eBay for nearly thrice its price tag.<br />Its profile was certainly boosted by its association with Mr. Mayer, a Grammy-winning singer and self-proclaimed “watch guy.” But these days, when the whole world has gone casual, choosy watch collectors are also falling for standard G-Shocks and other robust, thrifty timepieces like a $100 rubber-strapped  Timex  or $125 minimalist, metal-banded Swatches. “Everybody needs a utility watch...they’re great for washing dishes or any kind of tasks that you may not want to bang up your Swiss- or German-made higher-end timepiece [undertaking],” said Jason Buccieri, 28, a watch aficionado in Carmel, N.Y., who works in art operations and owns three beefy-cased, water-resistant G-Shocks.<br />Clayton Roth, 42, the owner of a professional dog-running business in Rhode Island, views decidedly undainty watches like his resin-coated G-Shocks as an occupational necessity. “I use them to time the dog runs...and I need something that is going to be light and not get destroyed if I do fall or get it wet if it’s pouring rain,” he said. When he’s off the clock, he savors his premium tickers like a stainless-steel Rolex Explorer and a handmade automatic number from Los Angeles’s Weiss Watch Company.<br />For many, the pandemic year jumbled the distinction between timepieces for work and weekend, letting prudent and practical watches occupy more wrist real estate. Mike DiAntonio, 28, an academic adviser in Boston who’s been working from home for around 11 months, straps on his down-to-earth G-Shock for work Zoom calls even if he otherwise dresses professionally. The casual watch—along with his off-camera slippers—puts him at ease.<br />That these watches offer a warm hit of nostalgia also elevates their appeal. Mr. DiAntonio’s battery-operated timepieces conjure the water-resistant Freestyle Shark watches he wore surfing as a child in New Jersey—minus the cartoonish neon colors. Mr. Roth likes that his G-Shock DW-5900 is the same design John Goodman’s character “Walter” wears in 1998’s beloved film, “The Big Lebowski.” And Mr. Mayer’s G-Shock 6900 delivers a double dose of nostalgia: The basic model was first launched in 1995, and the new release’s color scheme was inspired by the Casiotone keyboard Mr. Mayer played as a child growing up in the 1980s.</td>

      <td>Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would greatly hurt the economy, and the young and underqualified will be the ones to suffer if this is enacted.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Reality Check for a $15 Minimum Wage” (Feb. 9): Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would greatly hurt the economy, and the young and underqualified will be the ones to suffer if this is enacted.<br />I have been employed by a nonprofit gymnastics association for the past five years (since I was 14). As a student instructor (until high-school graduation) I made $7.25 an hour. An organization like the one I work for employs mostly students ages 14-18. Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would result in a reduction of staff, so much so that the services we provide wouldn’t be able to adequately be performed, ultimately leading to the demise of the organization.<br />Many of the employment opportunities my college-student peers and I seek are part-time and require little to no experience. These opportunities will disappear if the minimum wage is increased to $15 per hour. With that in mind, it is likely that America will see a decrease in employment and increase in poverty among young adults and inexperienced workers.<br />For the sake of the small businesses and the young and inexperienced workers, the proposal of a $15 per hour minimum wage needs to be fought and ultimately rejected.<br />Leah Bookser</td>

      <td>In “The Weekend Interview with Richard Alba: ‘Majority Minority’ America? Don’t Bet on It” (Feb. 6) John J. Miller notes that I believe we should quit counting racial/ethnic statistics. Correct, except that my subject was only the decennial census. It has seven questions, two about race, occupying 40% of the form. No room for questions on income, citizenship, immigration, etc. Is it not reasonable to conclude that the government cares about race above other issues? This is not the message we want sent to the entire population, including groups angry that race statistics, writes the Census Bureau, provide “services of particular interest to certain racial and ethnic groups.” Nor is the decennial robust enough to keep up with the demographic transformation Mr. Alba documents.<br />Ending racial discrimination requires new policies based on new statistics. The American Community Survey (ACS) is the source. It is the bureau’s largest sample survey, collecting data on 3.5 million Americans each year, and asking a wide range of questions: health, place of birth, veteran status, internet use, etc. Areas with a few thousand people can be studied by combining five years. The ACS’s scope, frequency and granularity can understand discrimination in ways not possible with the decennial census, the target of my “quit counting race”statement. The nation needs the decennial for its constitutional responsibility, the basic count used to reapportion, and for its capacity to provide a denominator for a vast array of statistical agencies. For policies responding to the institutional racism still with us and to the assimilation now unfolding before us the nation needs measures designed for those conditions. This is beyond the reach of the decennial, but not the ACS.<br />Kenneth Prewitt<br />New York<br />Mr. Prewitt was Census Bureau director 1998-2001.</td>

The output rise won’t kick in until April, given the Saudis already have committed to stick to cuts through March.<br />The advisers cautioned the plans still could be reversed if circumstances change, and the Saudis’ intention hasn’t yet been communicated to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the people and OPEC delegates.<br />“We are in a much better place than we were a year ago, but I must warn, once again, against complacency,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the Saudi energy minister, said at a conference Wednesday. “The uncertainty is very high, and we have to be extremely cautious.”</td>

Consumer activists say the disparity potentially leaves homeowners underinsured where they thought they were covered.<br />Many homeowners will learn that policies are anything but standardized across the industry, said Daniel Schwarcz, a University of Minnesota Law School professor.<br />Policies are more varied than they were a decade or two ago, he said. While some differences might work to homeowners’ advantage, a substantial majority could hurt them. As one example, some policies cover the risk that a structure collapses due to the weight of ice or snow, whereas others don’t, he said. Some may cover food spoilage resulting from the loss of power, though others don’t.</td>

He said later that year that the cancer was stage 4, terminal and progressing after months of several different treatment regimens. At the time he reiterated his intent to continue with his show, despite fatigue and other symptoms.<br />Ms. Rogers on Wednesday said Mr. Limbaugh had “proudly fought and defended conservative values in a way that no one else can. Rush often stood up and took arrows on his own because he knew it was the right thing to do.”<br />Beginning as a relatively unknown disc jockey at stations in Pennsylvania and Missouri, Mr. Limbaugh saw his star rise quickly after starting a talk show in 1984 in Sacramento, Calif., where he began espousing conservative political ideas during the Republican revolution of the Reagan era. In 1988 he began a new show at WABC-AM in New York that was syndicated nationally on AM and FM stations.<br />“The Rush Limbaugh Show,” marked by his signature brash and acerbic conservatism, was the most-listened-to radio talk show in the U.S., according to Nielsen Audio, reaching more than 20 million monthly listeners on more than 650 affiliates as of the end of 2020.</td>

      <td>In Tibet, writer Ed Douglas seeks out the true story of a mythical world and a long-vanished kingdom</td>
      <td>MOST OF US dream of a better world, even a perfect one. Not many of us, though, when challenged to locate our own utopia, would think of a ruined citadel in a half-forgotten corner of western Tibet. Yet here is where the myth of Shangri-La begins, at least in part, among the ruins of Tsaparang. Part monastery, part fortress, this eroded jumble of buildings and caves sits atop a promontory overlooking the silted gray waters of the Langchen Tsangpo, the “elephant river,” known in India as the Sutlej.<br />It rises to the east, near the sacred lake of Manasarovar, where a few years ago, my wife and I climbed stiffly out of a Land Cruiser to stretch our legs. It would be hard to overestimate the spiritual significance of this landscape. If there is, in T.S. Eliot’s phrase, “a still point of the turning world,” then this is it, a place profoundly sacred to Hindus and Buddhists alike. At the roadside was a vast billboard with an image of Xi Jinping and a slogan about fighting poverty.<br />We were three days into a high-altitude road trip, driving west from Lhasa, the mountains of the Himalaya unspooling to our left and ahead the desert hills of the rolling Tibetan plateau. At the wheel was Migmar, with his bouffant quiff and navy pea coat. He grinned for a selfie in front of the sacred peak of Kailas and we carried on.<br />Over the next pass the elephant river cut deep into a region of softer rock, creating a gorge half a mile deep. Migmar pulled into a parking lot to take in the view. Overlooking the valley, the local tourist office had put up an information board with inscriptions in Chinese, Tibetan and English. Travelers were instructed to admire the ‘stratums of earth forest’ with their ‘surrounding sonwy [sic] mountains that embodies the giant verve of land.’ There’s no shortage of land verve in the Himalaya.<br />Soon after, Migmar turned left off the main highway on a newly laid road so perfect I wish I’d brought my bicycle. It looped down through the stony wastes, dropping almost a kilometer in altitude to the banks of the Sutlej and the towering remnants of Tsaparang. This was once the thriving center of the Guge kingdom, which a thousand years ago rescued Tibetan Buddhism from extinction. Centuries later, Tsaparang fell prey to invasion and a changing climate. Now it slumbers in austere isolation, a brown tumble of ruins beneath an azure sky, like some art director’s dream of an alien dystopia, an impression enhanced during our visit by the presence of a whining camera drone that flitted like a mosquito among the ruined towers, operated by an excitable Chinese TV crew. (Rather sweetly, they apologized and turned it off when we complained.)</td>

      <td>The truth is coming out about Cuomo’s disastrous policy. Families like mine demand accountability.</td>
      <td>My mother, Joan Morris, died of Covid-19, which she contracted at a Brooklyn, N.Y., nursing home. She arrived there Jan. 24, 2020. She came down with Covid symptoms the week of April 5. She was sent to the hospital on April 10, was diagnosed with Covid on April 11, and died on April 17.<br />Last month the state acknowledged that 12,743 people died of Covid contracted in nursing homes because they were inexplicably put in harm’s way by the admission of new residents who were Covid-positive.<br />My mother’s death was entirely preventable. She had a treatable ailment (a broken vertebra) along with a pre-existing condition (advanced emphysema), and she would be alive today but for Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive order that forced nursing homes to accept Covid patients—which he issued despite the availability of thousands of beds in the empty Javits Convention Center, the largely unused Central Park field hospital, and the underused federal hospital ship USNS Comfort, which was stationed in New York for all of April. According to media reports, Mr. Cuomo and Health Commissioner Howard Zucker then undercounted, concealed and suppressed the nursing-home death toll.<br />My mother shouldn’t be a mere statistic on a dubious government chart. Unless there is meaningful accountability, the people Mr. Cuomo once called the most “precious” in our community will have died in vain. Families deserve to know the truth. State and federal prosecutors should open an investigation to determine if Mr. Cuomo’s executive response to Covid-19 was criminally negligent or a violation of laws against elder abuse.<br />Certainly it was an unprecedented public-policy disaster. Instead of owning its errors of judgment, the Cuomo administration pushed the Legislature to pass a measure shielding nursing homes from civil liability. This was a de facto grant of immunity for Mr. Cuomo’s policy decision, as lawsuits would have revealed the real numbers. The immunity was scaled back with another law in August, but it should be reversed entirely.</td>

      <td>Praising Trump’s record and criticizing his conduct isn’t ‘having it both ways.’ It’s simply common sense.</td>
      <td>Where does the Republican Party go from here? The party that abolished slavery, won the right to vote for women, and beat Soviet communism must continue to be strong and principled to move America forward.<br />But the liberal media doesn’t care about that. It wants to stoke a nonstop Republican civil war. The media playbook starts with the demand that everyone pick sides about Donald Trump—either love or hate everything about him. The moment anyone on the right offers the slightest criticism of the 45th president, the media goes berserk: Republicans are trying to have it both ways! It’s a calculated strategy to pit conservatives against one another. It’s also a ridiculous false choice. Real life is never that simple. Someone can do both good and bad things.<br />People feel strongly about Mr. Trump, but we can acknowledge reality. People on the left, if they’re honest, can find Trump accomplishments they like—a coronavirus vaccine in record time, Middle East peace, more accountability from China. People on the right can find fault with Trump actions, including on Jan. 6. Right or left, when people make these distinctions, they’re not trying to have it both ways. They’re using their brains.<br />Just as important, they’re proving people are more than their party affiliations. If we can’t make judgments beyond whether someone is Republican or Democrat, then America can’t face its biggest challenges. We separate into two camps that always hate each other. We become estranged from family and friends over politics.<br />Is that really what the anti-Trump media wants? Maybe. Hatred and polarization draw attention, ratings and clicks. But what’s good for them is bad for America. Some Never Trump and Always Trump Republicans also attack anyone who doesn’t join the all-or-nothing chorus. That’s not how I saw Mr. Trump conduct himself when I worked with him in the White House, where he engaged in internal debates, welcomed disagreements, and at times changed his mind.</td>

      <td>For the recurring series, That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and other emphatically opposed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />IN A PANDEMIC, the promise of automated indoor-gardening systems is compelling: Grow your own fresh herbs and veggies, with no need to brave superspreader supermarkets or dirty your fingernails. But is it worth devoting precious kitchen space to these devices—some as compact as a toaster, others as large as a bookshelf? Enthusiasts of hydroponic, or soil-free growing, say they’ll never go back to fretting over squirrels or hail. But naysayers argue that, given the investment of time and money, the economics might not add up. Here, both sides.<br />Laurie Stephans hasn’t bought lettuce or tomatoes from the grocery store in more than two years. Yet even in the depths of a Racine, Wis., winter—where temperatures struggle to reach the teens—she eats a salad filled with just-picked vegetables every day. Thank her fearsome fleet of 21 hydroponic planters.<br />These soilless devices have colonized many kitchens over the past year, their popularity stoked by alarming recalls of tainted produce and a desire to avoid crowded supermarkets. In the second quarter of 2020, revenue at  AeroGrow International ,  the parent company behind the AeroGarden brand of hydroponics, was up 245% year over year.<br />Unlike temperamental backyard plots, however, these planters promise to function as obediently as Keurigs. Simply pop in a few pods filled with seeds and growth medium, fill a water reservoir, hit a button and wait. The devices nourish, say, basil sprouts with a regulated supply of moisture and fertilizer while a canopy of sunlight-replicating LED lights shines down. After roughly 25 days, according to Click and Grow (and five times faster than seeds would sprout in the dirt, according to AeroGarden): Presto, pesto!</td>

      <td>LONDON—U.K. medical-ethics authorities gave the go-ahead Wednesday to controversial trials that will deliberately infect young, healthy volunteers with coronavirus with the aim of better understanding the virus’s impact on the human body and speeding vaccine development.<br />The trials, called human challenge trials, will be the first in the world targeting Covid-19 and will initially involve up to 90 volunteers between 18 and 30 years old, the government said Wednesday. They are set to begin in London by March, backed by $47 million in U.K. government funding initially announced in October.<br />With medics and scientists standing by 24 hours a day, researchers will inject closely controlled doses of coronavirus into the noses of quarantined volunteers. This set of volunteers won’t have received vaccines. The idea is to start with the smallest possible amount that allows researchers to gauge infection levels, symptoms and transmission methods while trying to ensure the volunteers’ safety.<br />If that goes well, a second stage of the trials is planned to include the use of vaccines—researchers haven’t specified which ones—to test how well they protect against symptoms and possibly transmission. Vaccines would be administered to healthy volunteers, who would then be purposely infected with coronavirus, again in closed-off quarters to contain the virus.<br />Scientific and medical-ethics views about the proposed trials have been mixed since the U.K. revealed its plans in October, with this week’s green light making the U.K. a pandemic outlier. Previous challenge trials have focused on malaria, typhoid, cholera and flu.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is warning that rising tensions with China could have serious consequences for U.S. businesses, laying out a worse-case scenario where some major U.S. industries would be crippled.<br />Full decoupling—meaning a complete cutoff of sales to China—would cost the U.S. aircraft and aviation industry between $38 billion and $51 billion in sales annually, the report estimates. That would translate to between 167,000 and 225,000 jobs lost.<br />Similarly, an end to U.S. semiconductor sales to China would cost the industry $83 billion in revenue and 124,000 jobs, according to the report entitled “Understanding U.S.-China Decoupling.”<br />The scenarios laid out in the 88-page report envision a complete end to sales between the two intertwined economic superpowers—the kind of outcome that is only likely to happen in an all-out war.<br />Still, the Chamber argues, it is important to contemplate extreme cases as a way to focus policy makers on the costs involved in battling China.</td>

Groomed his entire life to run the auto empire, Mr. Chung, the 50-year-old grandson of Hyundai’s founder, has shirked convention, down to often changing the color on his company car—occasionally opting for gold or navy blue—instead of keeping the standard-issue black. He earned his M.B.A. in San Francisco during the 1990s dot-com boom and has become one of the auto industry’s most outspoken technologists.<br />But negotiations between the iPhone maker and Hyundai and its subsidiary  Kia Corp.  broke down, according to South Korean regulatory filings last week. Hyundai’s discussions for self-driving cars continue with unspecified others, according to the filings.<br />The failure to seal a deal shows how challenging the terrain is for Mr. Chung and Hyundai, if not the broader auto industry itself, struggling to partner up or home-brew solutions for future technologies outside the traditional lines of business.</td>

It has never gotten off the ground in the U.S.<br />Instead, something similar in spirit but cheaper and more practical may be in sight. Both President Biden and Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) have proposed significantly expanding the child tax credit and dropping many of its restrictions, in effect turning it into a near-universal basic income for children.<br />The main aim of their proposals is to reduce child poverty, which is higher in the U.S. than in most advanced countries. Both would slash the number of children in poverty by around 3 million, or a third, according to the Niskanen Center, a center-right think tank.<br />In the process, it may also become the only major benefit in the U.S. that achieves near universality—testing traditional American notions of the safety net. “It would be a huge change in how we think about delivering benefits,” said Elaine Maag, principal research associate at the Urban Institute.<br />Federal benefits usually require the recipient to meet some criterion of need: poor (for food stamps, welfare and Medicaid), unemployed (for unemployment insurance), working or looking for work (the earned-income tax credit and some programs with work requirements), or disabled (Social Security Disability Insurance). Only Social Security and Medicare approach universality: Almost all elderly are eligible.</td>

      <td>Sales at the Italian brand have slipped further behind rival labels Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior in recent months</td>
      <td>During the pandemic, investors sought safety in a handful of top luxury stocks. Gucci’s owner  Kering  hasn’t made the cut despite its natural advantages.<br />On Wednesday the Paris-listed luxury company that also owns fashion labels Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta said sales in the three months through December fell 4.8% at constant exchange rates compared with the same period of 2019. Its most important cash cow, Gucci, reported a disappointing 10% drop in revenue. The worse-than-expected numbers sent Kering’s shares down 8% in early European trading.<br />Gucci had a much weaker fourth quarter than comparable brands at rival LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division, home to Louis Vuitton and  Christian Dior ,  increased sales by 18% in the fourth quarter. It isn’t just a recent phenomenon: Gucci hasn’t kept pace with LVMH’s fashion brands since early 2019 according to analysis by Bernstein. The pandemic is worsening the divide, though.<br />Gucci should have a competitive edge right now. Its owner has deep pockets to invest heavily in e-commerce, digital marketing and to expand in Asia where demand from Chinese consumers has rebounded quickly. That scale isn’t translating into clear market-share gains.<br />Kering has become too reliant on one brand—a problem investors have been pointing out for several years. Gucci generated 83% of group operating profit in 2019. While that level of exposure was a boon for shareholders in the early days of the label’s successful turnaround that kicked off around five years ago, performance is lagging now that the revamp appears to be running out of steam.</td>

Shopify appears to be one of Wall Street’s more controversial names, with roughly half its analysts now recommending the stock and half still on the sidelines.<br />The divide is illustrative of the broader controversy for post-pandemic investing: When a company enjoys a massive pull-forward in usage, just how much can it continue to grow?<br />One thing is for certain: 2020 was an epic win for Shopify.

Merchant sales on its platform were up nearly 76% amid the Black Friday/Cyber Monday period alone.

A 22% rise in net profit to $9.77 billion paved the way for a record final dividend and a special dividend in what was Mr. Stausholm’s first earnings update since succeeding Jean-Sébastien Jacques as CEO on Jan. 1. Mr. Jacques was ousted last year amid the fallout from the destruction of ancient rock shelters in a remote part of Australia.<br />Rio Tinto’s increased profit was driven by a rally in iron-ore prices to a nine-year high. Iron ore is used to make steel and has been one of the hottest commodities as China bets on infrastructure, such as new highways and apartment construction, to drive its economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.</td>

That followed results from a small clinical trial in South Africa that found the AstraZeneca vaccine didn’t appear to protect recipients from developing mild or moderate illness from the fast-spreading new strain of the coronavirus first detected in the country.<br />The J&J vaccine was found to be 57% effective at preventing moderate and severe Covid-19 symptoms in a larger trial held in South Africa, including from the B.1.351 variant, which has become the predominant version there. That was lower than the 72% efficacy rate observed during J&J’s trial in the U.K., which vaccine experts attributed to the South African variant’s ability to partially escape the immune response triggered by some Covid-19 vaccines.<br />When looking at just severe Covid-19 cases, the J&J vaccine was found to be 85% effective, including in South Africa.<br /></td>

      <td>A single digital address appears to have accumulated holdings in dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that was started as a joke</td>
      <td>The dogecoin market has a pack leader.<br />Records show that a person, or entity, owns about 28% of all of the cryptocurrency in circulation—a stake worth about $2.1 billion at current prices. The holder’s identity isn’t known, which is common in the opaque world of digital currencies.<br />It is hard to tell what to make of this giant position in what has long been a small and niche corner of the cryptocurrency world.<br />Dogecoin was created in 2013 as a satirical homage to bitcoin. Its developers were riffing off the meme of a Shiba Inu dog with bad spelling habits. It wasn’t designed to be used as a form of payment, or as anything except a joke. At the start of 2021, a dogecoin was worth about half a cent, even as bitcoin prices had surged to nearly $30,000.<br />Things have changed this year. Dogecoin surged in popularity after business and pop-culture icons including Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, rapper Soulja Boy and “Malcolm in the Middle” star Frankie Muniz began promoting it online. It isn’t clear what caught their attention.</td>

      <td>The NYPD says crime on trains and in stations is down, and city officials say the perception of crime is the main challenge</td>
      <td>The fatal stabbings of two homeless people in the New York City subway system over the weekend has sparked a debate between state and city officials over how to keep riders feeling safe.<br />Officials at the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority seized on the killings to call for the New York Police Department to deploy an additional 1,000 police officers in the nation’s largest public-transit system.<br />Sarah Feinberg, the MTA’s interim head of the subway and bus systems, said this week that she and her colleagues have made 30 requests in the past 18 months for more police officers and mental-health professionals to patrol transit. The authority says it would like to see 4,000 NYPD officers in the system.<br />City officials said Tuesday they would add 644 NYPD officers for a total of about 3,000 officers patrolling the sprawling system. They said such levels are sufficient and that the main challenge isn’t crime but the perception of crime.<br />NYPD officials say major crimes on the subway fell 31% last year compared with the previous year. “I think our subway system is the safest large transportation system in the world,” NYPD Chief of Transit Kathleen O’Reilly said at a news conference Tuesday.</td>
