Chief Executive Elon Musk said the company has suspended accepting bitcoin as payment for its vehicles.<br />“We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal,” Mr. Musk said Wednesday on Twitter.<br />Bitcoin’s value against the dollar fell more than 5% after Mr. Musk’s tweet.<br />Tesla earlier this year began to accept the cryptocurrency as payment for products sold in the U.S. The company also made a big financial bet on bitcoin when it bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency in the first quarter. Tesla has since sold some of those holdings, a move that boosted first-quarter earnings.<br />Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn has said the company opted to invest in bitcoin when it was looking for a place to store cash it didn’t immediately need as a way to preserve liquidity while also earning a return.</td>

      <td>Move comes amid a wave of major hacks, such as this week’s pipeline shutdown and SolarWinds espionage campaign</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden on Wednesday ordered U.S. agencies and software contractors that supply them to boost their defenses against cyberattacks that officials say pose a growing threat to national security and public safety.<br />The president signed an executive order that establishes baseline cybersecurity standards for U.S. agencies and their software contractors, including mandates to use multi-factor authentication and data encryption, and that requires federal information technology vendors to disclose certain data about hacks.<br />The order also establishes a cybersecurity safety review board, to be led by a mix of government and private-sector cybersecurity experts. The board will be empowered to investigate significant cyber intrusions and publish security recommendations. The board is modeled loosely on the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates airplane crashes and other transit failures, officials said.<br />The new order is intended to reorient the federal government’s approach to cybersecurity around prevention rather than crisis response, a senior administration official said. It came as Colonial Pipeline Co. restarted its 5,500-mile conduit—a major source of fuel throughout the East Coast—late Wednesday afternoon. The pipeline was taken offline on Friday in response to a cyberattack.<br />The order was written largely before that hack was disclosed and doesn’t specifically address critical infrastructure cybersecurity, like the energy grid or gas and oil pipelines.</td>

      <td>The dating app’s banter hasn’t delivered the picture it sold in its initial public offering</td>
      <td>For a company built around empowering its users to make the first move,  Bumble Inc.’s  first impression hasn’t exactly been a gentle letdown. Its shares have fallen nearly 38% from where they opened on the company’s Feb. 11 initial public offering. Wednesday’s first quarter results didn’t do much to rekindle investors’ love: The stock traded flat after hours after losing 6% on the day.<br />On paper, things look pretty enchanting: Bumble said revenue for both its namesake Bumble app and Badoo came in above Wall Street’s expectations for the quarter, as did total paying users. Second quarter and full-year guidance for revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization at the midpoint also beat analysts’ forecasts.<br />Taken on its own, those numbers sure make it sound like a keeper. But online dating is all about the next best swipe and, at 11 times forward sales, the case for Bumble still looks overvalued, even at a slight discount to its more mature peer  Match Group .<br />It comes down to shots on goal. While it operates the number two dating app in the world in Bumble, the company has just two dating apps. Match has more than 10 brands under its umbrella, including Tinder, the highest grossing dating app in the world; Pairs is the largest dating app in Japan, and Hinge tripled its revenue last year and is on pace to double it again, according to Match.<br />Ultimately, if you are betting on dating as the world opens up, Match simply has a larger grip on the market. It also beat Wall Street’s forecasts for the first quarter, even while one of its most significant markets in India remains highly challenged due to a recent spike in Covid-19 cases.</td>

U.S. officials have linked the attack to a criminal gang known as DarkSide.<br />“Colonial will move as much gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel as is safely possible and will continue to do so until markets return to normal,” the company said in a statement.<br />It previously said that it had restarted some smaller segments of the pipeline system by operating them manually, while its main line remained shut down. The company said that as of Tuesday afternoon it had delivered 41 million gallons of fuel to various delivery points.</td>

No one was injured, and the flight landed safely.<br />The progress in developing a fix for the engine covers comes as  United Airlines Holdings Inc.  hopes to return to service certain Boeing 777 jets that are powered by Pratt & Whitney engines. Boeing’s fix is expected to include metal components that would strengthen the engine covers, people familiar with the matter said.<br />United took 24 of the jets out of service after the Denver incident, and U.S. air-safety regulators ordered immediate inspections of those engines’ blades for cracks that could potentially lead to failures and their covers detaching. United has said it had another 28 of the jets with Pratt & Whitney engines in storage. Other carriers that operate 777s with those engines include South Korean and Japanese airlines.</td>

      <td>The Fed Chairman wanted higher prices. Lets hope it’s ‘transitory.’</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s inflation ship has come in, albeit more rudely than he probably wanted. The consumer price index rose a remarkable 4.2% at an annual rate in April, and 3% in the core measure that excludes food and energy. Mr. Powell wanted more inflation, and now he’s got it.<br />The surge in prices won’t surprise most Americans, who have been paying more everywhere from the grocery store to cars to the housing market. Prices in April rose across the board, but especially for goods and services in lower demand during the lockdowns. Hotel prices increased 8.8% for the month and 8.1% year-over-year. The monthly increase of 0.9% less food and energy was the largest since 1982.<br />As vaccines roll out, more people are going out and spending their savings and stimulus checks. Demand is increasing at the same time supply problems frustrate businesses. Used car and truck prices jumped 10%, which accounted for a third of the month’s CPI increase. One reason: New car production has slowed amid a global computer chip shortage. But that’s no consolation to middle-class Americans who buy used cars. The rich buy new Teslas.<br />Commodities have also been surging and are feeding into consumer prices. Corn prices are up 50% this year and some 125% year-over-year. Overall food prices climbed 0.4% from March and 2.4% over the past 12 months. Fresh produce and meat prices rose even more.<br />A worker shortage is also pushing up wages—average hourly earnings rose 0.7% in April—and may be starting to feed into higher consumer prices. Many small businesses were reluctant to pass on their increasing cost of goods and labor when demand was lower. But that may now be changing as consumers are spending more freely.</td>

      <td>Even as the 2020 stolen-election myth continues to tear at the GOP, the Biden Administration is elevating a key figure in the campaign to delegitimize Donald Trump’s election in 2016.<br />Susan Hennessey of the Brookings Institution announced this week on  Twitter  that she is joining the Justice Department’s national security division, where Politico reports she will be senior counsel. The post doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but it can play a role in election-related investigations and enforcement.<br />Ms. Hennessey made her name as a commentator by hyping Russian collusion allegations. A former National Security Agency lawyer, she bestowed phony credibility on the Steele dossier after the 2016 election. In 2017 she wrote that the unlawful leak of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador “posed a countervailing set of extraordinary circumstances.” She tweeted in 2019 that the decision to drop charges against Mr. Flynn was “an astonishing assault on the rule of law.”<br />Ms. Hennessey has an undisguised partisan interest in the Russia probe, which is still being investigated by U.S. Attorney John Durham. After the 2020 election, Ms. Hennessey tweeted that Mr. Durham’s work was “partisan silliness.”<br />Then there’s the investigation of Rudy Giuliani, who was recently the target of search warrants, apparently over dealings in Ukraine. Leaks to the press—perhaps from Justice—claimed falsely that the FBI had briefed him on a Russian disinformation campaign. Ms. Hennessey is the wrong person to be anywhere near these investigations, or anything that involves her miles-long list of people she loathes.</td>

      <td>Ousting Liz Cheney doesn’t end the GOP’s 2022 election problems.</td>
      <td>House Republicans ousted Liz Cheney from their leadership on Wednesday, but the GOP’s Donald Trump problem continues. They can’t win without his voters, but they also will struggle to win if the former President dominates the party and insists on re-fighting the 2020 election for the next four years.<br />Ms. Cheney was purged on a voice vote that was so overwhelming that no one even asked for a recorded tally. Her offense was challenging—too vocally for GOP comfort—Mr. Trump’s claims that the 2020 election was stolen and that the attempt to overturn the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6 was constitutional and warranted.<br />Many Republicans privately agree with Liz Cheney on both points, but they don’t want to get into a public fight with Mr. Trump. They want House leaders to focus on resisting the Biden agenda, and they think Ms. Cheney’s insistence on publicly rebutting Mr. Trump’s falsehoods was a distraction. She can now say what she wants as a backbencher.<br />But the GOP problem is less that Ms. Cheney won’t let Mr. Trump go than that Mr. Trump won’t let 2020 go. He can’t accept that he lost, so he’s busy rewriting history to convince everyone he was cheated. He’s making that claim a litmus test for GOP leaders or for candidates who want his endorsement.<br />That may please the Trump base but it won’t appeal to the swing voters the GOP needs to retake the House and Senate. Mr. Trump’s claim that he was cheated in November is the main reason the GOP lost two Georgia Senate seats in the Jan. 5 runoff. Trump voters stayed home after Mr. Trump told them their votes didn’t count. The pre-election polling and voter turnout couldn’t be clearer about this. Joe Biden’s agenda would be stalled now if Mr. Trump had put the party first after his defeat.</td>

      <td>Biden considers another waiver, but the real answer is to sink it.</td>
      <td>Every time America suffers a disaster that harms fuel distribution, we get a fresh reminder of the high price America pays for the 1920 Jones Act. So it is with the gas shortages caused by a cyber attack that last Friday shut down the Colonial Pipeline, which supplies roughly 45% of gasoline and oil for the East Coast. On Wednesday the Biden Administration said it “stands ready” to consider requests from shippers for a Jones Act waiver to allow more ships to transport fuel where it’s needed.<br />The Jones Act is a protectionist’s dream, requiring that any vessel transporting goods between U.S. ports must be American-built, manned and owned. The result is higher costs for everyone, and perverse inefficiencies such as making it cheaper for New England to import liquefied natural gas from places such as Trinidad and Tobago rather than from the Gulf Coast.<br />That’s why in a crisis Presidents rely on waivers. George W. Bush granted a waiver after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Barack Obama did it after Hurricane Sandy. Donald Trump did it after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.<br />The obvious question is why the U.S. keeps the law if it has to be suspended so often. The higher costs and inefficiencies don’t go away when the crisis does. The answer is that, like most protectionist legislation, the few who benefit want to keep it this way.<br />Mr. Trump found this out the hard way. At one point after Hurricane Maria he was considering a request from the Governor of Puerto Rico for a 10-year Jones Act waiver for LNG shipments. He abandoned the idea after a meeting with Republican politicians who vigorously opposed it.</td>

      <td>The Senate takes up a voting bill designed to rig the system in favor of Democrats.</td>
      <td>It was only a fundraising appeal, but Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) made a few big mistakes when he asked Tuesday, “Will we let today’s Republican Party revive Jim Crow, seize partisan control over how elections are run, and impose permanent undemocratic control of government?”<br />First, it dishonors those who fought real Jim Crow laws to suggest GOP voting reforms are synonymous with the effort—perpetrated by many white Southern Democrats—from the 1870s through the mid-20th century to wipe out black voting rights through poll taxes, literacy tests, and often violence and intimidation.<br />Second, Mr. Booker’s interest in election law is curiously recent. He never made voting reform a priority in any of the eight campaigns he’s conducted since 1998, though New Jersey has long had one of America’s more restrictive election regimes. Only this fall, for instance, will the Garden State start allowing in-person early voting, and for about half as many days as Georgia will.<br />Mr. Booker’s behavior seems to be the rule, not the exception, among Democrats these days. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also attacked Republicans Tuesday: “We are witnessing an attempt at the greatest contraction of voting rights since the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of Jim Crow,” he said. Hmmm. New York allowed early voting for the first time in 2020, but only for nine days, again about half the minimum period required in Georgia. And the Empire State hasn’t yet finally approved universal no-excuse mail-in ballots. Like the senator from New Jersey, Mr. Schumer never made his state’s restrictive voting laws a focus in any of his 16 campaigns since 1974.<br />But back to Mr. Booker. His accusation that the GOP wants to take permanent control of government undemocratically is a classic example of projection. That’s exactly what congressional Democrats seem to be trying to accomplish with S.1, the so-called For the People Act.</td>

      <td>BlackRock and others bill the cost to middle-income investors, in the form of lower returns.</td>
      <td>Workers with pensions or 401(k)s trust financial institutions to make the best investments for their retirement incomes. An increasing number of portfolio managers say they maximize returns with their Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance, or ESG, investment criteria. But is that true, and is it the proper role of financial institutions?<br />A recent analysis by Scientific Beta disputes “claims that ESG funds have tended to outperform the wider market.” Sony Kapoor, managing director of the Nordic Institute for Finance, Technology and Sustainability, a think tank, told the Financial Times that the research “puts in black and white what is only whispered in the corridors of finance—most ESG investing is a ruse to launder reputations, maximize fees and assuage guilt.”<br />BlackRock ’s  former chief investment officer for sustainable investing, Tariq Fancy, appears to understand this. He recently wrote in USA Today that he was concerned about portfolio managers exploiting the “E” of ESG investing because “claiming to be environmentally responsible is profitable” but advancing “real change in the environment simply doesn’t yield the same return.” Mr. Fancy criticized “stalling and greenwashing” in “the name of profits.”<br />This is a tacit admission that ESG investing upends the fiduciary duties portfolio managers owe their clients. As Mr. Fancy acknowledged, “no matter what they tout as green investing, portfolio managers are legally bound” to “do nothing that compromises profits.” As former Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia wrote on these pages last year, under the federal law that protects retirement assets, known as Erisa, “one ‘social’ goal trumps all others—retirement security for American workers.”<br />No one should be surprised when portfolio managers pay lip service to ESG investment criteria while in practice looking for companies that will generate higher profits. To the extent portfolio managers use ESG to justify investing in companies that are less profitable than alternatives, they are imposing a tax on their clients in the form of reduced returns. But shareholders don’t agree to pay this tax, and most have no idea the extent to which it’s being imposed.</td>

Auditors at OpenTheBooks.com found 82 county lifeguards earning at least $200,000 including benefits and seven making between $300,000 and $392,000. Thirty-one lifeguards made between $50,000 and $131,000 in overtime alone.<br />After 30 years of service, they can retire as young as 55 on 79% of their pay. The Los Angeles County Lifeguard Association makes all this possible. Since 1995 the union has bargained for better wages, hours, benefits and working conditions.<br />Over the past five years, lifeguard captain Daniel Douglas brought home $630,000 in overtime alone. His total employment costs in 2019 were $368,668—$140,706 base bay, $131,493 in overtime, $21,760 in “other pay” and $74,709 in benefits.<br />In 2009 the city of Santa Monica signed a 10-year, $25 million contract with the county for lifeguard services. In 2019 the city extended the contract for five years and $17 million. There were no identified competitors and the contract wasn’t put out for bid.<br />To be sure, being a lifeguard isn’t all fun in the sun: Some are EMTs and paramedics, and some are part of an underwater recovery team and participate in diving operations. Some are marine firefighters with specialized training for fireboat operations. Some are on duty for 24 hours at a time—though they’re allotted eight hours for sleep, and if they have a call that interrupts their slumber after five hours or less, “the entire 24-hour period shall be counted as hours worked,” the contract states.</td>

      <td>Representing a young nation, the ship descended on Antarctica. The crew made 20 landings before getting stuck in the ice.</td>
      <td>On Aug. 16, 1897, 20,000 Belgians lined the wharves of Antwerp to wave off the Belgica, a 113-foot three-masted steam whaler. She was departing for Antarctica, still a land of fable in the last years of the 19th century. Belgium had declared independence from Holland only 67 years earlier, and with the voyage of the Belgica, writes Julian Sancton, the young nation “was staking a claim to the next frontier of human exploration.”<br />“Madhouse at the End of the Earth” tells the story of the Belgian Antarctic expedition. Mr. Sancton, an American journalist who visited Antarctica for his research, structures his tale around three main characters: Adrien de Gerlache, a Belgian naval officer and the expedition’s leader; Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian polar explorer who served as the Belgica’s first mate; and Frederick Cook, the voyage’s “lone Yankee,” a New York doctor with a “peninsula of a nose.”<br />De Gerlache’s expedition “was sold as a scientific mission, but at its core it was a romantic endeavor.” The Belgian’s goals were to chart the uncharted; collect data on the region’s flora, fauna and geology; and locate the South Magnetic Pole, then thought to lie around the 75th parallel. Only three expeditions had ever sailed south of the 70th. The Belgica made stops in Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo, Uruguay, in October and November, before the men first sighted the Antarctic Peninsula, which extends toward the southern tip of South America, in January 1898. Over two months the crew discovered what is now the Gerlache Strait and made 20 landings, more than all previous expeditions combined. Then the ship traveled southwest and spent more than a year trapped in the Bellingshausen Sea.<br />Cook had joined the Belgica in Rio, having offered his services as the expedition’s doctor. He had been in Greenland with the American explorer Robert Peary in 1891-92, and was “famous among polar enthusiasts worldwide.” With Cook on board, the Belgica carried 14 Belgians, 11 foreigners and two cats. Before the expedition reached the ice, desertions and dismissals tipped the balance in favor of the non-Belgians.<br />Mr. Sancton conjures the fug of pipe smoke and unwashed men in the unventilated wardroom, the taste of kjøttboller—spongy canned meatballs resembling “soft, colorless gobs”—and the pearly sheen of fluted icebergs. Cook, who took a genuine interest in the well-being of every man aboard, quickly became “the most popular member of the expedition.” Mr. Sancton is pro-Cook throughout these pages, even when the man’s records are unreliable.</td>

      <td>Five things to expect from big concerts and festivals in the U.S. this summer and beyond</td>
      <td>When do big concerts return? It’s a complicated picture right now as some musicians sell out shows and others postpone them yet again. Just last week, Travis Scott’s fall Astroworld Festival sold out quickly, while Justin Bieber delayed his tour to 2022.<br />This summer, the concert business is expected to re-open gradually, thanks to vaccination efforts in the U.S. and U.K. But bigger concerts in arenas and stadiums could take until late summer and fall to gain  momentum. Here’s a guide to what to expect:<br />As more Americans get vaccinated and lockdown restrictions ease, concert tickets are selling briskly, in-person events, often socially-distanced ones, are proliferating and tour announcements are coming in fast. On Tuesday, Phish announced a 2021 tour that launches in July.<br />During an earnings call last Thursday, Michael Rapino, chief executive of  Live Nation Entertainment ,  the world’s biggest concert promoter, said that since February “our confidence has increased for our key markets,” including the U.S. and U.K. He pointed to “artists’ increasing confidence in performing this summer,” noting tours by Dave Matthews Band and Luke Bryan.<br />Just because a date is listed on your favorite performer’s website doesn’t always mean the show will happen.</td>

But her funds have sunk further than the broader market during May’s selloff in shares of technology and other fast-growing companies, suggesting their midwinter pullback was no fluke.<br />Her flagship innovation fund has fallen 15% in the first eight trading sessions of May. That is more than what the ETF shed in February and March when worries about a sharp rise in bond yields began to dent the allure of growth stocks. Shares of the fund are now down more than a third from their mid-February high after more than doubling last year.<br />The Nasdaq Composite, in comparison, has stumbled 6.7% in May and set a record as recently as April 26, while the S&P 500 is off 2.8% and hovers closer to its record highs.<br />Many of the stocks that sit in ARK’s funds are unprofitable tech and biotech companies whose lofty valuations are tied to bets that they will one day dominate their industries. Those stocks have stumbled lately on worries about rising inflation and an eventual tightening of monetary policy. The latest sign of inflation came Wednesday when the Labor Department said its consumer-price index jumped 4.2% in April from a year earlier, the highest 12-month level since the summer of 2008.</td>

      <td><br />New York<br />Will you leave “Awaken: A Tibetan Buddhist Journey Toward Enlightenment” profoundly changed? Probably not. The spiritual path the show outlines isn’t something you cram into an afternoon at the Rubin Museum of Art. You will, however, come away understanding some tenets and practices of Tibetan Buddhism and appreciating some of the roles art plays in this religious tradition.<br />The journey begins with a reflection on our ordinary state of mind and—warning—it isn’t reassuring. We are greeted by “Luxation 1,” a 2016 painting by Tsherin Sherpa whose jewel tones are as compelling as its composition is puzzling. Sixteen 18-inch canvases are hung in a grid, each presenting a fragment: bulging eyes here, grinning skulls there, and is that a horn? We sense an otherworldly creature—Vajrabhairava or “Lightning Terror,” the text informs us—but try as we might, we can’t piece him together. Opposite, monitors flash stills and videos plucked from daily life, from marches to trash-filled shorelines, sourdough bread recipes and passersby in masks. As in “Luxation 1,” nothing coheres; instead, the flickering images stir emotions and splinter our attention.<br />For Prince Siddhartha Gautama, it was old age, illness and death that did not cohere. But after a long and arduous meditation he understood the nature of suffering and declared himself “buddha,” Sanskrit for “awakened.” The show recaps this story with a relief carved around 800 to 900 and introduces some Buddhist tenets through, among others, an early 20th-century depiction of “The Wheel of Existence.” In it, various beings—demons, animals, humans, deities—revolve around a central hub in which a rooster, pig and snake chase each other. They symbolize attraction, confusion and aversion, the three poisons that drive the cycle of life, death and rebirth with the suffering these entail.</td>

The judge had frozen the funds in August while he considered the case.<br />Citi wanted the freeze to be maintained, saying it feared that even if it won on appeal, it might have difficulty recovering the money once the asset managers distributed it to their clients.<br />The dispute stems from a mistake in August in which Citi paid off—with its own money—a nearly $900 million loan balance owed by Revlon, when only an interest payment was due. When Citi asked for the money back, some of the recipients obliged, returning roughly $385 million.<br />Others—including Brigade Capital Management LLC, Symphony Asset Management LLC and HPS Investment Partners LLC—declined to return more than $500 million, touching off a legal dispute with the bank.</td>

      <td>Former acting defense secretary tells House panel the military’s response was proper when pro-Trump mob sought to prevent certification of Biden election</td>
      <td>Two former senior Trump administration officials defended their efforts to help secure the Capitol during the pro-Trump Jan. 6 riot in their first testimony about the attack.<br />Former President Donald Trump’s last acting defense secretary, Christopher Miller, and his acting attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, both of whom served in those posts for only a few weeks, said on Wednesday they had sent backup security personnel as soon as they understood the gravity of the breach of the Capitol’s perimeter. Mr. Trump’s supporters went on to overrun the Capitol as Congress started to certify President Biden’s Electoral College win.<br />“This isn’t a video game where you can move forces with the flick of a thumb,” Mr. Miller said, testifying before the House oversight panel. He said his actions that day reflected concerns, as expressed by former defense secretaries days earlier, about the military involving itself in election disputes. “Our nation’s armed forces are to be deployed for domestic law enforcement only when all civilian assets are expended, only as the absolute last resort,” he said.<br />Mr. Rosen said he was proud of the Justice Department’s response, noting that he told federal tactical teams to be on standby and deployed hundreds of federal agents after the building was breached. “I think the threat of violence was understood by everybody,” he said.<br />The hearing was part of several continuing inquiries into the riot. The Justice Department has charged more than 400 people with alleged offenses stemming from the attack, which left five people dead. Several government watchdogs and congressional committees are examining a law-enforcement response that experts across the political spectrum have said amounted to one of the biggest lapses since the federal security apparatus was overhauled following the Sept. 11 attacks nearly two decades ago.</td>

      <td>Can the short-term surge avoid inflicting long-term damage?</td>
      <td>Inflation is surging as Washington prints and spends money at historic levels. Meanwhile Covid-related policies are still making it hard for businesses to staff up and increase production. A former Trump economic adviser isn’t the only one concerned that too much money chasing too few goods may be more than a temporary problem.<br />The former Trump adviser, Kevin Hassett, served as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Now he’s outside government and watching the feds shovel cash to consumers while making life more difficult for producers. Today Mr. Hassett writes via email that “the Biden Administration is providing the biggest positive stimulus to demand since WWII, and at the same time doing everything it can to suppress supply. Higher [unemployment insurance] benefits, closed schools (which keep one parent at home), and promised corporate tax hikes practically guarantee that supply can not keep up with demand. It is a recipe for an inflation shock we have not seen in the U.S. in a generation.”<br />It’s not just the Biden administration’s reckless fiscal policy at issue. On the monetary side of the Beltway swamp, the Federal Reserve continues to maintain emergency easy-money policies even though the U.S. economy has been rebounding since last summer. And all of the money the Fed has created is not just showing up in markets for virtual coins and actual beach houses. Some Fed officials have dismissed general inflation as merely “transitory” following the pandemic. The Journal’s Gwynn Guilford reports today:<br />This column has been surprised that America’s asset managers have not reacted more aggressively in response to the inflation threat. Perhaps it is because so many of the people who run money are too young to remember the inflation of the 1970s or have only vague childhood memories of their parents’ anguished discussions on the topic. But if bond investors demand higher yields, consumers feel the pain when they borrow at higher interest rates. If both investors and consumers come to expect higher prices in the future, the problem will not be transitory.<br />Richard Fisher does remember the 1970s. As a young economist he joined the Carter Treasury Department while inflation was raging. More recently he spent a decade running the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. He’s undeclared on the question of whether the current inflation spike is transitory or not and says “we’re in a tug-of-war” between big near-term price pressures and long-run inflation expectations. “I hope the Fed is right,” he says in a Wednesday phone call.</td>

      <td>David Satter (“The Rhodes Scholarship Turns Against Its Legacy of Excellence,” op-ed, May 8) suggests that the world’s preeminent international graduate scholarship has been “corrupted” by being turned into a competition “rigged” by racial preference. His claims are false and misinformed.<br />The selection of Rhodes Scholars is focused on our criteria of excellence of intellect and character, sympathy for others and potential for leadership and positive impact. Our instructions to selectors make clear that committees should choose the strongest candidates. They are explicitly directed not to try to “balance” or seek diversity of gender, race, ideology, academic field or any other characteristic.<br />Competition for the scholarship, now available globally through 24 constituencies, is intense. For our U.S. constituency, 16 different committees interview outstanding finalists and select the two they believe best exemplify our criteria. Mr. Satter concludes that the system must be racially rigged to result in our 2021 cohort of U.S. scholars, in which 10 of the 32 were African-American, 11 were other students of color and 11 were white. The assumption that a meritocratic selection process could not possibly have produced this result is an insult to the remarkably talented young people who, to quote his own words, “survived a withering competition.”<br />His premises are further proven wrong by data about our selection outcomes. The number of winners by race, gender and other characteristics varies significantly each year, as one would expect in a system that chooses the strongest individuals. In 2019 four of the 32 Americans selected were black and 17 were white—which coincidentally reflects the percentage of U.S. college students who are white, and exceeds the percentage of whites within the Ivy League.<br />All our scholars were selected solely for their individual excellence. And while it is harder than ever to be admitted to Oxford, today’s Rhodes Scholars consistently outperform the graduate population overall. For eight of the past 10 years, Rhodes Scholars have earned more distinctions per capita than the Oxford average.</td>

This is a smokescreen to obscure the shameless effort of southern states—which recently experienced a substantial black voter-registration and turnout influx—to ensure that such powerful political participation by its most marginalized citizens cannot happen again.<br />Black voter turnout in Georgia was sky-high in 2020 and 2021, thanks to extraordinary organizing efforts. In 2020, election officials expanded access due to the pandemic. Yet voters still had to overcome significant barriers—including five-hour wait times in Fulton County—to vote. Georgia legislators reacted to this powerful civic engagement by trying to shrink the electorate with a voting bill transparently targeted at black and brown voters.<br />That some blue states have inadequate voting laws doesn’t justify Georgia’s actions. Recently, these states have moved to expand access. Georgia, joined by Florida and perhaps soon by Texas, Arizona and others, is taking the opposite approach: making voting harder. That’s why, when evaluating discrimination claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, courts apply the Supreme Court-approved “totality of circumstances” test. It examines a locality’s political reality, history of voting rights and the extent to which minority-group members bear the effects of discrimination when considering these claims.<br />Misused statistics can’t hide the concerted attack on voting rights, and “they do it in New York” is not and never has been a defense for Georgia’s discriminatory conduct.<br />Sherrilyn Ifill</td>

Now we find that taxpayers will be on the hook for billions of unpaid loans. How about if the schools themselves become the lenders?

A trade truce reached by both sides early last year has led Beijing to shift its economic focus from tariffs to pressing for the relaxation of sanctions against Chinese companies, especially telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co.<br />No final personnel decisions have been made, said the officials, who added that there are also reasons to keep Mr. Liu in this role. China’s Foreign Ministry referred questions to China’s Commerce Ministry, which oversees trade.

It was the first time that the association broke down the sales that way and comes amid questions about the strength of demand for Tesla’s electric vehicles in China after a run of adverse publicity.<br />Tesla didn’t immediately respond to questions. The company doesn’t publish monthly sales figures and releases only global sales data each quarter. On Tuesday, the association said Tesla’s April wholesale figure of 25,845 was down 27% from March, worse than the 12% month-on-month decline in overall electric vehicle sales.<br />Some analysts have questioned whether there would be enough demand in China to absorb most of the Shanghai factory’s planned output of 500,000 vehicles a year. While a portion of the company’s Chinese production could be earmarked for export, the bulk of buyers would likely need to come from China—the world’s largest auto market—for the factory to be sustainable. Demand from the rest of Asia is relatively weak, and Tesla is planning new production plants in Europe and the U.S., its other main markets.<br />Tesla started exporting Model 3s from China to Europe last year, with 7,000 cars arriving in two shipments in October and December, according to the company. Tesla’s new plant in Berlin is due to start production later this year. The company has said the Berlin plant will initially assemble the Model Y.</td>

What really jarred me was that the English that they spoke is an English that certain Black people speak even today in parts of South Africa.

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. budget gap widened in the first seven months of the fiscal year, as federal spending continued to outpace rising tax receipts while the nation recovers from the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The government ran a $1.9 trillion deficit from October through April, a record for the seven-month period and a 30% increase from a year earlier, the Treasury Department said Wednesday. Outlays rose 22%, to a record $4.1 trillion, driven by higher safety-net spending such as jobless benefits and nutrition assistance, as well as Covid-19 relief programs including emergency small business loans and stimulus checks.<br />Tax revenue rose 16%, to $2.1 trillion, primarily due to higher receipts from individuals and corporations, which are larger so far this year compared with 2020, when Congress delayed tax-payment deadlines until July. Federal tax receipts also hit a record for the seven-month period ending in April.<br />The economy is poised for robust growth this year as economic activity picks up and employers continue to add jobs, factors likely to boost government receipts. But Treasury officials warned the latest figures from April don’t give a true picture of the economic factors underlying government revenue because of changes to the traditional timing of tax payments during the pandemic.<br />Over the past 12 months, the U.S. deficit totaled $2.7 trillion, or 12.2% of gross domestic product, according to the Treasury data.</td>

      <td>This repetitive and highly pleasurable task is cooking and meditation in one</td>
      <td>THERE IS SOMETHING deeply calming about stuffing a grape leaf. Trust me, I know. In the early months of the pandemic, I found solace in my kitchen and, to soothe my nervous system, began to fold and roll cigarillos of vine leaves. I had learned the recipe in Cyprus while researching my latest book, a collection of recipes from all around the Eastern Mediterranean.<br />Biting my lip in quiet concentration, I’d unfurl each leaf onto a plate, smoothing out its wrinkles with the tips of my fingers before carefully placing a spoonful of rice at the base. I’d mold the rice into an oblong shape and turn the sides of the leaves in to meet each other. Then, deftly and—most important—confidently, I would tightly roll each leaf over itself and place it alongside others in a pot to braise.<br />Across the Middle East, variations on stuffed vegetables abound, but rice-filled grape leaves may be the most prized. Known as dolmades in Greece, yaprak sarmasi in Turkey, koupepia in the Republic of Cyprus and warak enab in Palestine, the dish gets a unique array of stuffings, spices and aromatics depending on the context. When I was growing up, my Iranian mother made dolmeh for special occasions, shaping them into fat triangles she filled with rice, ground lamb and yellow split peas, and steamed in a sweet and sour broth made with verjuice and sugar.<br />Yet dolmeh never became part of my own culinary repertoire. I found them fiddly, time consuming. Life is too short to stuff a grape leaf, I thought. Until, that is, I cooked them with Çizge Yalkın and her grandmother, Nahide Köşkeroğlu, in a village just outside the Cypriot capital, Nicosia. Their Turkish-Cypriot version, filled with tomato-and-mint-flecked rice, held the flavors of the region’s sun-kissed soil and turquoise waters. I was sold.<br />I had visited Cyprus to learn how the food culture of the island tells a wider story of migration. Cyprus’s position in the most easterly corner of the Mediterranean Sea—at the nautical crossroads of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa—has made it the object of conquest over millennia. The ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Persians, Romans, Arabs, Venetians, Ottomans and British have all laid claim to the island, and diverse flavors run through its food culture. Despite its long history of migration and exchange, however, the island has, since 1974, been split rigidly in two: the Republic of Cyprus in the south, predominantly Greek-Cypriot, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, predominantly Turkish-Cypriot. A UN-patrolled buffer zone divides them.</td>

Volvo didn’t say how big a stake it might float.<br />“A potential listing on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange could create an opportunity for global investors to participate in our journey to become a leader in the fast-growing premium and intelligent electric vehicle segment,” Mr. Samuelsson said.<br />Volvo Cars have long discussed a potential listing, but Wednesday’s announcement marks the first concrete step toward going public. The company said whether to go ahead with the offering would depend on market conditions.</td>

      <td>Costs of airfare, used cars and restaurant meals offer clues to inflation puzzle</td>
      <td>The surge in prices in April was a shocker. Excluding food and energy, the core index rose 0.9% from March, the biggest one-month increase since 1981, and three times more than Wall Street expected. This was as surprising as the subdued April payroll increase reported just five days earlier.<br />The 12-month core inflation rate jumped to 3%, the highest since 1995. This was partly due to “base effects” as price drops in April 2020, when pandemic closures were taking effect, exited the 12-month calculation. But base effects cannot explain the March-to-April jump.<br />Subdued jobs growth and strong price increases in April together suggest resurgent demand, fueled by vaccinations, stimulus checks and low interest rates, is bumping up against sluggish supply.<br />Some of this is clearly transitory and will reverse once the economy is fully reopened. At this point it’s impossible to tell how much, but there are signs that at least some isn’t transitory.<br />Three broad trends are apparent, as illustrated by airfares, used cars and restaurant meals.</td>

President Jeff Skoll, co-founded the social-impact Rise Fund.<br />He admitted earlier this year to paying $50,000 to college counselor William “Rick” Singer so a proctor could fix his son’s wrong answers on the ACT. Mr. McGlashan arranged to have his son take the test at a school in West Hollywood, Calif., in December 2017, where a proctor could improve his score after the teen completed the exam. Mr. McGlashan said his son didn’t know about the scheme.<br />Wednesday’s sentencing, done remotely in federal court in Boston, is the latest activity in the far-reaching college admissions cheating scandal that prosecutors unveiled in March 2019 and dubbed Operation Varsity Blues. Twenty-five other parents have been sentenced in the case, their punishments ranging from probation to nine months in prison. In total, 57 people were charged, including coaches, a university athletics administrator, a test proctor and test site administrators.<br />Parents who pleaded not guilty are scheduled to stand trial in September. Coaches and a University of Southern California administrator are slated for trial in November.</td>

      <td>Marginal rates have been a lot higher, but the actual share the top 1% pay stays remarkably constant.</td>
      <td>With deficits at levels not seen since World War II, the March $1.9 trillion stimulus only beginning to spend out, and President Biden calling for significantly higher marginal tax rates to help fund another $4 trillion of spending, maybe it’s time for a reality check on how high marginal tax rates, and the actual tax rates paid by Americans, can be raised without crushing economic growth. Proponents of massive tax increases will argue that economic growth and prosperity are compatible with high tax rates by pointing to the 35 years of postwar prosperity in America, when the top federal tax rate was 70% or higher.<br />But before accepting this as proof by example, it’s worth examining how many taxpayers actually paid those top rates and what percentage of their income high earners actually paid in taxes. Economists Gerald Auten of the Treasury Department and David Splinter of the Joint Committee on Taxation have compiled an extraordinary new database using Internal Revenue Service data on taxes actually collected since 1962. The top marginal income-tax rates and the taxes actually paid, including payroll taxes, as a percentage of income for the top 1%, top 10% and bottom 50% of income earners are shown in the nearby chart. The figures for 2016-20 are comparable estimates by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.<br />The top tax rate of 91% in 1962 applied to families with joint incomes, in today’s dollars, of $3.38 million. After deductions and credits, only 447 tax filers out of 71 million paid any taxes at the top rate. The top 1% of income earners paid only 16.1% of their income in federal income and payroll taxes, while the top 10% paid 14.4% and the bottom 50% paid 7%. This followed the pattern set by the top Depression-era and wartime tax rates. Only three filers out of six million paid any taxes at the top Depression rate and only 13 out of 50 million paid any taxes at the top wartime rate. The top 1% of earners paid 12.6% and 23.5% of their income in federal income and payroll taxes in 1938 and 1945, respectively.<br />President Kennedy recognized that while confiscatory tax rates collected little revenue, they stifled growth as resources were squandered in the “avoidance of taxes” rather than the “production of goods.” When the top tax rate was reduced to 70%, individual income-tax collections continued to grow and the actual percentage of income paid in taxes by high-income earners barely changed. Only 3,626 out of 75 million filers paid any taxes at the new 70% rate. When the Reagan tax cut reduced the top rate to 50%, gross domestic product grew. Taxes collected from high-income earners as a percentage of their incomes were largely unchanged, as the chart shows. Only 341,000 of 109 million filers paid any taxes at the new 50% top rate.<br />The 1986 tax reform reduced the top rate to the postwar low of 28%. The reform also closed loopholes, offsetting the rate reductions and other changes in the tax code. Revenues grew as the economy expanded and asset sales surged at the lower marginal tax rate. Twenty-six million out of 115 million filers paid taxes at the 28% rate. The top rate was raised to 39.6% in 1993 and has fluctuated between 39.6% and 35% since. Only 453,000 out of 123 million filers paid any taxes at the 39.6% rate in 1993.</td>

      <td>Covid has brought us back to the future, in which the University of Chicago was a 20th-century pioneer.</td>
      <td>The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated higher education’s move toward online classes. But as futuristic as Zoom and video streaming are, “distance learning” is nothing new.<br />Thomas Foster launched the International Correspondence Schools in 1890. He was publisher and editor of the Mining Herald newspaper in Shenandoah, Pa. Foster founded the paper after a series of coal-mining accidents and championed safety-training programs and lobbied hard for an 1885 state law requiring miners to pass safety tests.<br />The law was ineffective. Uneducated miners couldn’t pass the tests. To help give them a fighting chance, Foster started publishing test problems in his newspaper. Miners learned at home and mailed back answers to be checked. Seeing a business opportunity, Foster launched ICS, which eventually offered some 250 courses in mechanical engineering, electricity, architecture, plumbing and other trades. Foster was both president and a teacher. By the early 1900s ICS served one million students, more than 1% of the U.S. population at the time.<br />Later William Harper, a former Yale classics professor, became president of the University of Chicago and made correspondence classes a central part of its educational offerings. The university granted degrees in math, biology and the classics mainly through correspondence, though combined with some residential instruction. Between 1924 and 1925 the Correspondence School accounted for 29% of the university’s graduates. By 1926, 143 instructors were teaching 10,545 students, who could complete 50% of a bachelor’s degree and 33% of a master’s through correspondence. Correspondence teaching at Chicago was a victim of its own success: After contentious debates about financing and faculty pay, it spun off into multiple departments and was eventually discontinued.<br />Based on my own experience teaching university students, distance learning ought to work well in languages, math, statistics and perhaps the sciences—areas that focus on objective information—but not in fields requiring debate and discussion, such as history or politics. In the study of human behavior, historical events, models of society and philosophy, it is harder to separate the object of study from those participants debating it.</td>

      <td>Prices are rising at their fastest clip in years, but the Fed is relaxed because expectations aren’t embedded</td>
      <td>Inflation might be picking up, but it isn’t like people are singing songs about it.<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that consumer prices rose 0.6% in April from March, putting them 4.2% above their year-earlier level. Some of that gain on the year was driven by a rise in gasoline prices, but core prices, which exclude food and energy items, rose 0.9% last month and were up 3% from a year earlier. That marked the biggest 12-month rise in core inflation since 1995.<br />In some respects the pickup in inflation has been both predictable and predicted. Prices dipped in April last year as the Covid-19 crisis shut down much of the country. Now we have come up against the anniversary of those declines. Beyond those so-called base effects, the supply-chain problems brought on by the pandemic have been evident for some time. It wasn’t hard to guess what might happen when the rising demand brought on by a reopening economy met those bottlenecks.<br />That is why Federal Reserve officials aren’t acting at all alarmed about what is happening with prices. This week several of them have said they expect price gains to pick up this year, but that they don’t believe much of the rise in inflation will persist once the supply-chain snarls have been resolved. The central bank isn’t ready to start reducing its asset purchases yet, much less to think about raising rates.<br />Part of why is that, eye-popping as some of the price increases over the past year have been, higher inflation hasn’t embedded itself in consumer psyches. Americans under 60 have next to no experience of what it was like when inflation was such a problem that popular musicians were singing about it, like Marvin Gaye did in 1971 (“Inflation no chance/To increase finance”) and again in 1972 (“The nation’s taxation/Is causin’ all, all this inflation”).</td>

Last July the court similarly overturned Apple’s €13 billion bill for Irish back taxes on years’ worth of international earnings.<br />It won’t be the final word: The European Commission is likely to appeal both annulments to a higher court. Even more important, the decisions will feed European conviction that changes to the rules are necessary to ensure digital giants’ international profits are taxed at levels closer to what the companies pay in the U.S.<br />Some will face bigger bills if the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development project to overhaul global corporate tax rules reaches an agreement by its summer deadline. The  Amazon  ruling will likely boost those negotiations. Even if they fail, France, the U.K., Spain and a handful of other countries around the globe will likely start applying their own digital service taxes. Many capitals had delayed implementing the new levies in the hope an OECD agreement could be reached.<br />A new proposal from the White House revived talks last month. Hopes are high, but hurdles remain. One sticking point is ensuring the new rules will apply to all the U.S. tech giants. Amazon, in particular, has become a potent symbol in some capitals and Wednesday’s court victory will only fuel this fire.</td>

      <td>Central bank’s vice chairman sees inflation rising higher in coming months before moderating later this year</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—U.S. inflation could rise somewhat further in coming months before moderating later this year, a top Federal Reserve official said Wednesday, adding that the central bank’s easy-money policies will likely remain unchanged for some time.<br />Richard Clarida, the Fed’s vice chairman, said he anticipates inflation remaining consistent with the central bank’s inflation-targeting framework adopted last year, notwithstanding a flurry of factors that could push prices temporarily higher. These include both statistical effects and supply bottlenecks in some sectors.<br />“These one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on underlying inflation, and I expect inflation to return to—or perhaps run somewhat above—our 2% longer-run goal in 2022 and 2023,” Mr. Clarida said in a speech prepared for delivery to the National Association for Business Economics International Symposium. “This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework the Federal Reserve unanimously adopted in August 2020.”<br />Under that strategy, the Fed aims for annual inflation to average 2% over time. In the near term, that will mean letting prices rise faster than 2% a year to make up for lower inflation over the past decade.<br />Since last year, the Fed has held overnight interest rates near zero and purchased at least $120 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage bonds to smooth the economy’s recovery from the recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</td>

      <td>A growing gap between available workers and job openings has triggered a debate over whether pandemic-related unemployment benefits are keeping people from taking jobs. Several Republican-led states have moved to drop the enhanced benefits, and the Biden administration said it is taking steps to encourage more jobless people to seek employment. Here are some answers to questions about adjustments that are happening to jobless benefits.<br />At least nine states have said they are rejecting extra pandemic-related benefits. Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and South Carolina have sent letters to the Labor Department asking to end their participation in federal programs. Those include a $300 supplemental benefit, extended payments and benefits for gig-economy and other workers not typically eligible for unemployment benefits.<br />Alabama, Arkansas and Tennessee have said publicly they plan to opt out of the programs early, but they hadn’t sent letters to the Labor Department as of Tuesday.<br />Most states aren’t offering a bonus. However, Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte of Montana said residents would be eligible for a $1,200 “return-to-work bonus” if they were receiving unemployment benefits as of May 4 and subsequently took a job and completed at least four paid weeks of work.<br />Job-search requirements vary by state, but generally call for unemployment-benefits recipients to provide evidence that they are looking for work. That might include proof of applying for work online, attending a job interview or participating in a career fair. People can lose their benefits if they don’t document their searches.</td>

      <td>We tested new high-tech carafes that promise to increase users’ H20 intake using push alerts, redeemable point rewards and interactive tops. Some nudges worked better than others.</td>
      <td>‘DRINK MORE water’ has become a widely adopted healthcare mantra for a reason: Some doctors say that even mild dehydration can impair alertness and cognitive function. At this point, nearly a million Instagram posts are hashtagged #waterbottle and, after a particularly wellness-focused year, some people view their water bottles as high-status extensions of themselves.<br />To keep up with the hydration craze, carafe companies have released new, high-tech versions that promise to increase your H2O intake through virtual nudges and tops reminiscent of trendy fidget toys. “We’re so busy with our day-to-day lives that automatic reminders can be a welcome encouragement,” said nutritionist Rachel Paul. We tested three cutting-edge bottles to see if such prods were, in fact, motivating, or just irritating intrusions into our days.<br />This Jetsons-esque jug uses a bluetooth-enabled water-level sensor to keep you on track to meet your “daily water goal” (determined by a companion app that factors in your age, elevation and exercise frequency). If the app decides that you’ve gone too long without taking a swig, the bottle’s LED base will start flashing rainbow colors. Dare to ignore the drinking directive? You’ll also earn a push notification. We found the bottle’s  Technicolor  insistence a bit grating.<br />No apps here: Every time you refill this bottle, you twist and click its clever lid to reveal a new dot along the side. (Each dot equals one bottle gulped.) Think of it as an upgraded tally system that acts as what Jen Sincero, author of “Badass Habits,” calls a “habit-stacker.” Here, the desire for the tactile satisfaction of clicking another dot into place helps motivate you to drink more water. After a day of satisfying snaps, we were encouraged. The soft sippy straw—and a low price—don’t hurt, either.<br />While Closca’s borosilicate glass and grippy silicone design is comfortable to drink from, you might not be sold on the company’s insistence that you trek to specific hydration stations near you to refill your carafe. Checking in at these user-submitted water fountains (located via the Water App) earns points you can redeem for charitable donations to eco-friendly nonprofits. Another perk for environmentalists: The water-tracking feature on the app tells users how many plastic bottles they’ve avoided sending to a landfill. Still, we’re more motivated to fill our bottles from the taps in our kitchens.</td>

      <td>The Japanese auto maker hasn’t attracted the same excitement around its electric-vehicle plans as the likes of General Motors and Volkswagen, but in some respects it is technologically ahead</td>
      <td>Toyotas have a reputation for being reliable but unexciting, and the Japanese automotive giant that makes them can come across the same way. Yet it is likely more forward-thinking than it gets credit for.<br />The financial stability of  Toyota Motor  was on full show in annual results published Wednesday. The company reported net income for the year through March equivalent to $20.7 billion—roughly 10% higher than the previous period—and it forecasts further growth this financial year. Unlike other big auto makers, the company didn’t make any quarterly losses due to last year’s lockdowns and doesn’t expect to curtail production due to the chip shortage.<br />The stock rose about 2%, even as the wider sector was led down by a 10% drop for  Nissan .  After the Tokyo market closed on Tuesday, Toyota’s local peer unexpectedly forecast another year of losses amid the semiconductor drought.<br />Toyota’s steady performance belies the changes under way at the world’s largest car maker by sales. Although it advertises it less aggressively, the company is as focused as the likes of  General Motors  and  Volkswagen  on keeping pace with Tesla and Silicon Valley software. Toyota is also becoming more vocal about its response—perhaps with an eye to tech-obsessed U.S. investors.<br />In a break with tradition, the company gave the keynote speech in the presentation of its annual results to chief digital officer James Kuffner rather than Chief Executive Akio Toyoda. Toyota hired Mr. Kuffner—an American robot engineer with an academic background at Stanford, the University of Tokyo and Carnegie Mellon—in 2016 from Alphabet’s pioneering self-driving car project.</td>

Jay-Z is considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Tina Turner, who achieved stardom in the 1960s as part of the R&B duo Ike and Tina Turner, staged a hugely successful comeback as a 1980s pop-rock artist with a raspy voice. The Go-Go’s were the first all-female group who wrote their own music and played their own instruments to top the Billboard album chart. Carole King, a towering pop songwriter in the 1960s and beyond, influenced generations of singer-songwriters with her classic 1971 album, “Tapestry.” Foo Fighters, formed from the ashes of Nirvana and led by Dave Grohl, turned post-grunge rock into an arena staple. And for decades, the multifaceted art-rocker Todd Rundgren has been an experimenter and iconoclast, paving the way for boundary-crossing artists like Prince and Beck.<br />This year’s inductees won out over nominees that included influential hip-hop artist Mary J. Blige, Nigerian Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti and heavy-metal pioneers Iron Maiden. According to the Rock Hall’s rules, to be eligible, artists need to have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before induction.<br />Three of this year’s inductees were nominated for the first time: Jay-Z, Foo Fighters and the Go-Go’s. Meanwhile, Carole King and Tina Turner are now the second and third female artists to be inducted into the Rock Hall twice—following Stevie Nicks. Mr. Grohl also was previously inducted—as a member of Nirvana.<br />A voting body of more than 1,200 music executives, artists and past winners weighed in on this year’s nominees, based on the artists’ influence, innovation and other factors.</td>

At stake is Epic Games Inc.’s “Fortnite,” a videogame with hundreds of millions of players and control of the sprawling mobile app marketplace.<br />“Everyone wants to read her mind,” said Chris Sagers, a Cleveland State University law professor and an antitrust scholar.<br />The conflict erupted after Epic Games introduced an in-app payment system within “Fortnite” that skirted Apple commissions and its policy requiring developers to use its own payment processing services. That prompted Apple to expel “Fortnite” from the App Store, provoking Epic’s antitrust lawsuit and its claims that Apple is exploiting the popularity of its devices to squeeze developers.<br />Apple says that it isn’t a monopoly and that competition is flourishing in a distribution landscape that includes Google Android software and gaming consoles. The trial, which kicked off last week, is expected to run through May.</td>

      <td>Real estate 2.0 is still just knocking on disruption’s door.<br />For an industry that has historically relied upon a paper-intensive, time-consuming process of buying and selling homes, the past few years have brought a lot of progress. We can now see the value of a house in one click, tour it virtually with a few clicks or sell it with a few more. The promise is evident in the flood of companies coming to the public markets that tackle automated home flipping, like  Opendoor  and Offerpad, or seek to improve the fragmented brokerage model, like Compass.<br />Zillow  Chief Executive Rich Barton has said he and his co-founders realized people weren’t ready to buy and sell homes electronically on demand back in 2005. But 14 years later, with a human agent still at the center of most real-estate transactions, Zillow bet that a growing population of consumers were finally ready to embrace big change with iBuying.<br />Last year, the rise of remote work made Zillow and fellow real estate technology companies look smart. Investors started to believe that the pandemic was just the impetus the industry needed to transform on a large scale. In an 11-month span from mid-March 2020, Zillow shares soared nearly 700%—more than 2.5 times the rise of  Zoom Video Communications  over that period.<br />But now, as vaccination rates tick up and workers filter back into offices, investors are starting to waver. Zillow shares have shed 43% of their value in less than three months, while Opendoor shares have fallen more than 50% from their highs this year. Compass, which went public in April, is now valued at less than it was after its last private round in 2019.</td>

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has killed dozens of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives.<br />As tensions mount over the contested city of Jerusalem, which sparked the current cross-border violence, protests also broke out in Arab communities across Israel with some rioting in mixed cities. Israel’s government declared a state of emergency in one city and its military redeployed troops to contain the fallout.<br />Since Monday, Israel has struck over 500 targets in Gaza, including overnight raids targeting what Israel’s military said were senior Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad officials, some inside their houses.<br />Hamas has launched more than 1,000 rockets toward Israel, including 200 that fell short and landed inside Gaza, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman. Others have been intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome System. Col. Conricus said Israel sent two infantry brigades and an armored brigade to the border to prepare for possible ground operations. “No specific orders given yet as to what to do on the ground but…preparing for various scenarios,” he said.</td>

Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which suffered its biggest drop since late February, ticked 0.2% lower.<br />Signs of mounting inflation have weighed on stocks this week.

For their part, several Fed officials have said the economy still needs support from low rates.<br />Concerns that a burst of inflation may prove more intense and longer-lasting than investors had expected have sharpened focus on inflation data for April, due to be published at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the consumer-price index to have jumped 3.6% last month from a year earlier, up from 2.6% in March.

      <td>WASHINGTON—U.S. tariffs have led to a sharp decline in Chinese imports and significant changes in the types of goods Americans buy from China, new data show, with purchases of telecommunications gear, furniture, apparel and other goods shifting to other countries.<br />Nearly two-thirds of all imports from China—or roughly $370 billion in annual goods—were covered by tariffs imposed by the U.S. in 2018 and 2019. Tariffs now cover just half of Chinese exports to the U.S., or about $250 billion in goods annually, as U.S. companies buy more from other countries, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of information from Trade Data Monitor.<br />The Trump administration imposed the levies in 2018-19, aiming to boost U.S. factory production by making Chinese imports more expensive for the American companies that bring them in. That so-called re-shoring of manufacturing hasn’t happened in any appreciable way, economic data show, as U.S. companies instead turned to other countries in Asia for supply.<br />Vietnam has been an especially big beneficiary. It now ranks No. 6 globally for imports to the U.S., up from 12th as recently as 2018.<br />“If the goal was to reduce imports from China then it succeeded,” said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents U.S. companies that do business in China. “But if the goal was to increase manufacturing employment in the United States I don’t see any evidence that that’s happened. If the goal was to increase imports from other countries in Asia or increase manufacturing employment in Vietnam, it’s succeeded.”</td>

Tin last fetched as much at the height of the run-up in metal markets in 2011, when prices crested at more than $33,000 a ton.<br />Tin’s advance is one of the biggest moves in commodity markets that have ripped higher, feeding expectations among investors that inflation will accelerate, at least temporarily. Lofty commodity prices have acted as a brake on factories. Companies are looking to pass higher input costs through to consumers, some of whom are feeling the pinch. Worries about inflation have sent jitters through Wall Street, hurting stocks.<br />“Demand is wild across the board,” said Evan Morris, co-president of Nathan Trotter & Co., adding that he has never experienced such acute shortages of tin.<br />The Sadsburyville, Pa.-based manufacturer of solder wire and other tin products is racing to keep up with orders. Coronavirus has constrained supplies of raw metal coming out of Indonesia and elsewhere, while a snarl-up in container-shipping markets has led to weekslong delays in transporting tin from Southeast Asia and Latin America.</td>

      <td>Economists expect an extended upswing in prices as the recovery gains momentum and the pandemic continues to scramble supply and demand for goods</td>
      <td>U.S. consumer prices likely rose sharply in April as the economic recovery picked up, reflecting surging demand as the pandemic eased and higher prices due to supply bottlenecks.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the Labor Department to report its consumer-price index jumped 3.6% in April from a year earlier, up from 2.6% for the year ended in March. That would be the highest 12-month level since the summer of 2011. They expect to see the index rise a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in April from March. The index measures what consumers pay for goods and services, including clothes, groceries, restaurant meals, recreational activities and vehicles.<br />The so-called core price index, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, likely rose 2.3% in April from a year before, the economists estimated.<br />Consumers are seeing many prices jump for a variety of reasons as the U.S. economic recovery gains momentum. Used-car prices have surged, thanks to a global chip shortage that has dampened production of new cars. The average price paid for a used car exceeded $25,000 in April for the first time in the history of research firm J.D. Power’s tracking. Many companies are passing on to consumers the higher costs they are facing for crops, oil and truckers’ wages. Airfares and hotel-room rates are climbing as consumers start traveling again after a year of restraint during the pandemic.<br />More broadly, rising prices reflect strong consumer demand fueled by widespread Covid-19 vaccinations, easing business restrictions, trillions of dollars in federal pandemic relief programs and ample consumer savings. Real U.S. gross domestic product rose 6.4% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter and economists surveyed by the Journal in March forecast the second quarter to grow at an 8.1% annual rate, putting the U.S. economy on track for its best year since the early 1980s.</td>

      <td>With rocket barrage, militant group tries to court young Palestinians behind eviction protests</td>
      <td>When the secretive military chief of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas emerged from the shadows last week, he chose to weigh in on a land dispute in East Jerusalem, threatening to retaliate against Israel if Palestinian residents there were evicted from their homes.<br />“If the aggression against our people…doesn’t stop immediately,” warned the commander, Mohammad Deif, “the enemy will pay an expensive price.”<br />Hamas followed through on the threat, firing from the Gaza Strip, which it governs, over a thousand rockets at Israel since Monday evening. The barrage and the Israeli counterstrikes targeting Hamas positions in Gaza have set the two sides on a course for another conflict and escalated tensions across Israel and the Palestinian territories.<br />Hamas’s show of force is one way the militant group is trying to win over young and frustrated Palestinians like those who have led the protests over the evictions, but have been losing faith in their aging leaders and relinquishing hopes for an independent Palestinian state.<br />“I think Hamas right now is promoting a very calculated and very planned crisis,” said Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at the Moshe Dayan Center of Tel Aviv University.</td>

      <td>IEA cuts global demand growth forecast as India battles Covid-19 wave</td>
      <td>The oil supply glut that built up after the pandemic forced producing countries to slash output has almost returned to normal levels, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday.<br />But in its monthly report, the IEA cut its 2021 global demand growth forecast by 270,000 barrels to 5.4 million barrels a day. Demand in Europe and the Americas in the first quarter was weaker than previously thought, the IEA said. The agency cut its second-quarter forecast for Indian demand as the country struggles with high coronavirus infection rates.<br />The Paris-based organization left its demand estimates for the second half of the year unchanged, adding that vaccination rollout programs, rebounding economic activity and easing transport restrictions in the U.S. and Europe clear the way for crude demand to begin outstripping supply later this year.<br />The agency expects demand to outstrip supply even after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies raise output. The IEA cut its already moderate supply growth forecast for non-alliance producers to roughly half the amount of last year’s contraction, while also forecasting a further drop in U.S. production in line with OPEC’s forecast this week.<br />The supply stocks held by the wealthy nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development slipped to 1.7 million barrels above the five-year average of 2016-20, the IEA said. “Anticipated supply growth through the rest of this year comes nowhere close to matching our forecast for significantly stronger demand beyond the second quarter,” it said.</td>

      <td>TOKYO— SoftBank Group Corp.  smashed profit records in its home country, riding a series of blockbuster initial public offerings to an annual net income of 4.99 trillion yen, equivalent to $45.9 billion—the highest ever for any Japanese company.<br />The results, which include a record profit of ¥1.93 trillion for the quarter that ended in March, cap a wild year in which the Japanese technology investor rode roller-coaster stock markets from the lows at the beginning of the pandemic to recent highs.<br />The numbers were driven largely by an annual investment gain of ¥6.29 trillion at its $100 billion Vision Fund and its successor, whose portfolio companies have been listing in droves as the stock market soars. The Vision Fund’s biggest win was a ¥2.6 trillion investment gain from its nearly 40% stake in South Korean e-commerce company  Coupang Inc.,  which listed in March. SoftBank also logged ¥945.9 billion in gains from the sale last year of a controlling stake in U.S. telecom company Sprint Corp. as well as a rise in the value of its remaining holdings.<br />SoftBank said it has tripled the size of the capital it has pledged to its second Vision Fund, to $30 billion, amid the strong returns.<br />SoftBank shares ended at ¥9,180 on Wednesday, nearly double their price a year ago.</td>

But as it became clear Nissan couldn’t simply give Mr. Ghosn more money, Mr. Kelly said he and other Nissan executives examined ways to pay Mr. Ghosn after retirement, including by retaining Mr. Ghosn as a consultant for Nissan. Mr. Kelly said he reasoned that Mr. Ghosn might not quit if he knew another payday was coming.<br />“I did not conspire with Mr. Ghosn or others,” Mr. Kelly said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) said Republicans who ignored former President Donald Trump’s continuing false claims of a stolen election were undermining democracy, in a defiant speech on the House floor on the eve of a vote expected to oust her from the House GOP’s top ranks.<br />House Republicans are expected to vote Wednesday morning to remove her as chairwoman of the House GOP conference, after weeks of tension between Ms. Cheney and other party leaders over Mr. Trump’s role in inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol and his future in leading the Republican Party. GOP leaders have emphasized party unity, including with Mr. Trump, while Ms. Cheney has insisted that the GOP cut ties with the former president.<br />“Remaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar,” Ms. Cheney said on the House floor Tuesday evening. “I will not participate in that. I will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former president’s crusade to undermine our democracy.”<br />Mr. Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House earlier this year over actions related to the riot, in which his supporters stormed the Capitol building as Congress was gathered to formalize Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. Mr. Trump was acquitted in the Senate.<br />Mr. Trump has claimed that the election was stolen from him, and he has continued to make unfounded allegations after Mr. Biden took office. In a statement Tuesday, he said the election was “rigged and stolen from us.”</td>

      <td>China is aging more rapidly than many expected, posing a serious challenge to its economic model</td>
      <td>China is graying much more rapidly than many demographers expected. That won’t be enough to derail its rise—but it will pose a serious challenge to its savings and export-heavy economic model. It could also mean a markedly smaller Chinese economy by midcentury than most mainstream economists expect.<br />The top-line results of China’s once-a-decade census were released Tuesday, showing a sharp drop in births and a steeper drop in the working age population than expected. China’s fertility rate is now just 1.3 children per woman, in the same league as aging societies such as Japan and Italy. Originally the results had been due in April, prompting widespread speculation that the numbers would be bad.<br />China is far from the only major country with a demographic problem—the U.S. fertility rate dropped to just 1.64 in 2020. But what is striking about the latest Chinese figures is how fast they are now diverging from previous estimates. According to official figures, China’s population between 15 and 64 years of age was 967 million in 2020—down a full 35 million from 2015. The latest version of the United Nations’ core fertility scenario assumed China wouldn’t drop to that level until well after 2030.<br />Besides the obvious need to completely scrap the remaining vestiges of China’s longstanding policies to limit births, Beijing has some other levers it can pull to offset the drag on the labor force: raising the retirement age, easing controls on internal migration, helping companies increase automation, or dramatically boosting immigration. With the exception of automation all of these are politically very tricky, however—especially the last.<br />Moreover, a rapidly aging population presents unique challenges for China’s growth model, which until now has relied heavily on productivity-driving exports and a high savings rate to help offset the significant downsides of the very large state presence in the economy. Working-age populations often save more for the future, while the elderly spend down their savings or rely on their children or the government.</td>

      <td>Apprehensions in both groups dropped for first time in a year, but the number of single adults caught entering the U.S. illegally continued to rise</td>
      <td>The number of migrant families and unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally dropped in April for the first time in nearly a year, according to government data disclosed Tuesday.<br />Customs and Border Protection agents arrested 48,226 migrants traveling as families and 16,933 children who arrived on their own. Arrests for each of those groups of migrants declined by about 10% compared with March.<br />However, arrests of single adults rose by about 11.5% to 108,301. As a result, the number of arrests by CBP ticked up slightly from March, to about 173,400. That means the Biden administration is still on pace to preside over a 20-year high in illegal border crossings by the end of the federal budget year in September.<br />The number of adults crossing is likely lower than the arrest totals because many attempt to cross the border repeatedly after being caught and returned to Mexico.<br />There are likely multiple reasons for April’s dropoff in families and children crossing the border. Significant among them is stepped-up immigration enforcement by Mexico, which has been more carefully policing its southern border with Guatemala as well as common migrant routes through the country, at the behest of the U.S. government.</td>

That debate is coming to a head Wednesday, when House GOP lawmakers are expected to vote to remove Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) from her post as the No. 3 Republican in leadership.<br />Oren Cass, executive director of the conservative think tank American Compass and Mitt Romney’s former policy adviser, on Tuesday likened Mr. Trump to an earthquake that exposed “what was poorly built or outdated” but also presented an “opportunity to rebuild.”<br />Mr. Cass added that the GOP’s tensions aren’t just about personality but also about whether the party should think more intentionally about how the economy is divided by class.<br />“All of these debates get tangled up in the more personality-driven component. I think when you strip that out, you still find the conceptual debates there,” he said of the party, arguing that the gaps between middle-class Americans and so-called elites deserved attention from conservatives. “The reality is, we’re going to have to resolve those, if conservatism is going to move forward beyond Trump to actually provide a direction for the country.”</td>

      <td>The unconstitutional pieces of H.R.1 could blow up the midterms.</td>
      <td>Senate Democrats made a push Tuesday for their version of H.R.1, the House bill to seize control of election rules nationwide. How they imagine they have any mandate for this is a mystery. In a Senate divided 50-50, Democrats don’t even have the committee votes to amend their own bill.<br />At Tuesday’s session of the Senate Rules Committee, the two sides took turns offering revisions that, with minor exceptions, failed 9-9. GOP Leader Mitch McConnell knocked Democrats for trying “to hot-wire our democracy itself without a single vote from the other side.” Another worry: The constitutionally dubious parts of H.R.1 make it a time bomb for the 2022 midterms.<br />The bill has broad mandates that ostensibly apply only to federal elections. States would be forced to offer no-excuses mail ballots. They’d have to count votes straggling in 10 days late, provided the postmarks were stamped Election Day. They’d have to set up same-day registration and couldn’t withhold ballots from felons, except those imprisoned.<br />Where does Congress get the power to make such rules? As 20 state attorneys general said in a March letter, the Constitution grants Congress the authority to set “the Time of chusing the Electors.” But specifying the “Manner” is for state legislatures. For presidential elections, see you in court, H.R.1.<br />For other federal races, H.R.1 has more leeway: The Constitution lets state lawmakers set rules for electing Senators and Representatives, but “Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.” A legal problem here is that H.R.1’s mandates are so detailed that they can’t help impinging on state elections for Governor, Attorney General and so forth.</td>

      <td>A Labor Department survey rebuts their jobless benefit claims.</td>
      <td>White House economists say there’s no “measurable” evidence that the $300 federal unemployment bonus is discouraging unemployed people from seeking work. They were rebutted by Tuesday’s Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Jolts survey, which showed a record 8.1 million job openings in March.<br />That roughly equals the number that payroll employment is down from the February 2020 pre-pandemic peak. Job openings increased across the economy, but especially in food services and accommodation (185,000), state and local education (155,000) and arts and entertainment (81,000). Restaurants are reopening and expanding capacity as lockdowns lift and more people get vaccinated, so they need more workers. More schools are reopening, which means they need janitors, bus drivers and security officials.<br />But these jobs often pay less than what most workers could make on unemployment. That explains why the number of job openings in many industries increased more than the number of new hires in March. In leisure and hospitality, job openings increased by a whopping 267,000 but hires declined by 6,000. Hmmm. Job openings in state and local education grew by a sizeable 155,000—2.5 times as much as hires.<br />Overall job openings in March increased by about 600,000 while new hires ticked up a mere 200,000. The number of workers who quit their jobs also grew by 125,000. This is usually a sign of a strengthening labor market, but in this case some quitters may be leaving their jobs because they figure they can make more unemployed for the next six months after Democrats extended the bonus into September.<br />This week the governors of Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi and South Carolina announced they will forego federal funding for the $300-a-week supplement to unemployment insurance, joining Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, who did so last week. Businesses will be grateful to have workers back, and so will their customers.</td>

The Federal Bureau of Investigationhas opened a civil-rights investigation into the shooting.<br />Chance Lynch, a local lawyer representing the Brown family, said the videos showed Mr. Brown had been seated in a car in his driveway when the shooting began, then backed the car away to flee the officers. There were at least six bullet holes in the passenger-side window and one in the rear window, he said. There was no weapon visible, and after the shooting, deputies pulled Mr. Brown’s limp body from the car and placed it facedown on the ground, he said.<br />“At no point did we see Mr. Brown pose a threat to the law-enforcement officers,” Mr. Lynch said, describing the shooting as “unconstitutional and not justifiable.”<br />Sheriff Tommy Wooten II has placed three of the deputies who fired their weapons on administrative leave. In a video statement posted Tuesday on his Facebook page, Sheriff Wooten said he was committed to ensuring an outside, independent investigation and offered condolences to the family and support for his staff.</td>

      <td>Iran’s Palestinian ally reignites its conflict with the Jewish state.</td>
      <td>The jihadists of Hamas on Tuesday launched the biggest single-day rocket attack on the Jewish State in memory, with hundreds flying toward Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as well as the usual civilian targets in southern Israel. Israel struck back at 500 targets in Gaza, and this has the potential to become a larger conflict after a relatively long period of Mideast quiet.<br />The Hamas attacks come after days of Palestinian riots in Jerusalem, some prompted by long-running property disputes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Israeli courts ruled in favor of Jewish owners and against Palestinian leaseholders who claim rights to the property dating to Jordan’s occupation of East Jerusalem after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The case’s Supreme Court hearing was delayed.<br />Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the Palestinian West Bank region adjacent to Jerusalem, has been held up as a moderate negotiating partner for Israel. Yet his party fomented the Jerusalem violence, broadcasting that it “calls on everyone to raise the level of confrontation in the coming days and hours in the Palestinian lands,” according to Palestinian Media Watch.<br />The 85-year-old Mr. Abbas, who has headed the Palestinian Authority since 2005 without standing for re-election, may want to turn up the temperature to compensate for falling public confidence in his rule. He’s in competition with Hamas and even more extreme groups, which he shut out of power in the West Bank last month by postponing elections yet again. Hamas, which promises the destruction of Israel, one-upped Mr. Abbas’s riots by reigniting its military confrontation.<br />Regional politics are at work too. Hamas is funded and supplied by Iran, whose Supreme Leader last week praised “the pure blood of Resistance martyrs” in Palestine. The Biden Administration’s courtship of Iran in renewed nuclear negotiations has been met by Houthi escalation against Saudi Arabia and now Hamas escalation against Israel. The regime may think that the more its proxies clash with U.S. allies, the more eager the U.S. Administration will be to make concessions.</td>

      <td>President Xi Jinping has made no secret of his ambition to make China the dominant global power of the 21st century. But the latest Chinese census reveals a major vulnerability: What if the Middle Kingdom doesn’t have enough young people?<br />After some delay China finally released its census results Tuesday. Though the population grew a little last year—to 1.412 billion in 2020 from 1.4 billion—the more salient fact is that its population continues to gray as Chinese women are having fewer babies. The proportion of people 60 or older increased to 18.7% of the population (from 13.3% in 2010), even as it recorded the lowest number of annual births (12 million) since 1961.<br />Beijing has seen this coming. In 2016 Chinese couples were allowed to have two children instead of one, reversing a policy in place for 35 years. Last month the People’s Bank of China recommended the government abandon its population control policies if it hopes to compete with America, but even that may be too late. Once fertility falls, the trend is hard to reverse no matter what incentives governments offer.<br />Many governments have tried, and some believe that Poland or Hungary (which now spends nearly 5% of its GDP to encourage its citizens to have more children) may have the answer. But generally these policies have either failed outright, or shown at best modest fertility gains.<br />The social and economic implications are enormous, involving everything from the dynamics of the Chinese family to the growing demands on China’s already stressed and underfunded health and pension programs. In March the government announced it will gradually raise the retirement age from 60 today, no doubt in expectation of these results. The retirement costs would be difficult in any country, but China hasn’t achieved broad prosperity beyond its coast and major cities.</td>

      <td>Occidental’s first-quarter results show long-term investors hope for returns—even if that is sometime in the distant future</td>
      <td>A commodity producer will always be sensitive to factors beyond its control, but few ride the waves more dramatically these days than  Occidental Petroleum .<br />After reporting unsurprising first-quarter results, its shares tumbled by almost 8% Tuesday—a much steeper decline than other U.S. producers experienced after a cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline left the largest fuel conduit in the country shut down. The stock-market reaction appears overdone given the short-term nature of the problem rather than a structural decline in U.S. crude oil demand.<br />More important to flag is the progress Occidental Petroleum has made since last year. Part of that can be seen in the shift in forecasts: A year ago, analysts expected the company to turn a net loss of $660 million for the first quarter of 2021. Its actual net loss came in at roughly half of that. The real standout was its strong free cash flow of $1.6 billion, the company’s highest quarterly free cash flow in a decade and about double analysts’ expectations a year ago.<br />The Permian and DJ Basin assets underlying Occidental’s ill-timed Anadarko Petroleum acquisition are finally starting to shine. Permian production came in at the high end of guidance, for example. Another standout was Occidental’s chemicals business, which was its second-largest source of pretax income. Strong construction-related polyvinyl chloride demand, driven by robust housing starts, is one factor behind that performance.<br />All of that will help Occidental slowly but steadily whittle away the enormous debt burden it took on for the Anadarko purchase. The company has stuck to its debt-reduction promises thus far, closing on the sale of roughly $500 million worth of assets last quarter and repaying $174 million of debt. Sector investors focused lately on cash returns will have to look elsewhere, though: It will be some time before the company can direct that free cash flow back to shareholders’ pockets. Its single focus at the moment is to whittle down its $30 billion-plus net debt load to the mid-$20 billion range.</td>

      <td>Yes, the Trump approach to China was chaotic. But out of it came innovations, including whole-of-government problem solving.</td>
      <td>A National Security Council memo to President Trump, drafted in late 2016, laid out the facts very clearly: “China’s aspiration is manifestly not to settle for a balance of power with the United States, [it is] to achieve hegemony over its neighbors and the Western Pacific.” Moreover, this “goal of hemispheric supremacy isn’t the whim of President Xi Jinping,” since 2012 the head of the Chinese Communist Party. “It stems from Party aspirations going back decades; Xi is merely accelerating the timeline.”<br />While a few foreign-policy experts had long been alarmed by the CCP’s bid for primacy, it took the advent of the Trump administration, unconstrained by the conventional wisdom of the Sinocracy, to get Washington to counter Mr. Xi’s stepped-up ambitions. Josh Rogin’s superbly researched “Chaos Under Heaven: Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century” is the first book-length dive into that newborn competition.<br />The book’s main theme is that, even with all of its serious downsides, Trumpian chaos and a relentless disregard for “how things are done” actually enabled his national-security policy team to innovate. One outcome of this creativity was a new whole-of-government approach that brought in Attorney General William Barr and FBI director Christopher Wray. Both led efforts to uncover a vast CCP network of political influence, espionage, and technology theft in the U.S.<br />Indeed, a new American focus on the CCP’s campaigns of internal subversion might be the Trump administration’s most enduring policy innovation. Alongside Beijing’s military modernization and oft-flexed diplomatic muscle, China has also been spreading its influence inside the U.S. and throughout the West to weaken resolve and co-opt elites. Mr. Rogin, a columnist for the Global Opinions section of the Washington Post, reports that China “hawks” on Team Trump enlisted foreign experts such as Australia’s John Garnaut, who had helped confront the CCP’s malign influence in his own country, to educate Washington about how to deal with similar threats.<br />In what could be the plot of a thriller, Mr. Rogin traces Washington’s efforts to engage the CCP threat. The FBI and the Department of Justice began criminal investigations and prosecutions of U.S.-based scientists recruited by China to collect sensitive information. Meanwhile, working with a network of American academics, the Trump administration confronted the CCP’s influence on U.S. college campuses. In turn, Beijing gave no quarter, trying (unsuccessfully) to intimidate then U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley into silence on the Uyghurs of Xinjiang and threatening U.S. businesses with sanctions if they supported Taiwan or Hong Kong.</td>
