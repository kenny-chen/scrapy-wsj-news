      <td>Fed chairman also says monetary policy alone won’t be enough to restore the labor market to full strength</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve will continue bolstering the U.S. economy through low interest rates and hefty asset purchases, Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday, stressing that the labor market remains stunted by the pandemic.<br />The Fed is unlikely to “even think about withdrawing policy support” by raising rates or reducing its bond purchases for the foreseeable future, Mr. Powell said at a virtual appearance before the Economic Club of New York.<br />The Fed chief also repeated his call for more fiscal assistance for the economy, saying that monetary policy alone won’t be enough to restore the labor market to full strength. “It will require a society-wide commitment, with contributions from across government and the private sector,” Mr. Powell said.<br />“Workers and households who struggle to find their place in the post-pandemic economy are likely to need continued support,” he said. “The same is true for many small businesses that are likely to prosper again once the pandemic is behind us.”<br />The U.S. economy shrank 3.5% last year, its largest yearly contraction since just after World War II, the Commerce Department reported. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 6.3% in January from 6.7% a month earlier, the Labor Department said Friday. That compares with a 3.5% unemployment rate in February 2020, before the pandemic struck.</td>

      <td>A decision on case, argued in November, is pending before the high court</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration told the Supreme Court that the Affordable Care Act remains constitutional, reversing the Trump Justice Department’s position that the entire health-care overhaul was void because Congress reduced to zero the penalty for failing to carry insurance.<br />“Following the change in Administration, the Department of Justice has reconsidered the government’s position,” Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler said in a two-page letter to the justices Wednesday on the pending case.<br />The move was expected, as President Biden campaigned on expanding Obamacare along with a more vigorous federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. Former President Trump throughout his term denounced to the signature law of the Obama administration, although he never proposed any alternative healthcare program after the Republican-controlled Congress rejected legislation to repeal the measure.<br />Texas’s Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, sued to strike down the Affordable Care Act after Congress in 2017 reduced the penalty to zero. With Trump administration backing, he argued the law no longer was constitutional because it no longer generated revenue for the U.S. Treasury. The argument extrapolated from the 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding the law, which required most individuals to carry health insurance or pay a penalty along with their income taxes, under Congress’ authority to levy taxes.<br />The 2012 decision found that the insurance mandate effectively offered individuals a choice of paying a tax or carrying insurance, rather than a dictate to purchase a product against their will.</td>

Loujain has been released,” Ms. Hathloul’s sister, Lina, wrote on  Twitter .  Lina, who lives in Europe, posted a photo of a video call with Loujain showing both women smiling. Loujain, 31 years old, appeared noticeably older in another photo released by her family, with gray streaks in her otherwise jet black hair.<br />Ms. Hathloul was detained in May 2018, weeks before the lifting of a ban on women driving that she and other detained activists had campaigned against for years. A Saudi terrorism court in a secretive trial sentenced Ms. Hathloul in December to nearly six years in prison on charges of incitement against the regime and serving a foreign agenda.<br />She was released Wednesday on three years’ probation, with a five-year travel ban, after a reduction for time served. “She is not free. The fight is not over,” her sister tweeted.<br />Mr. Biden, speaking at the Pentagon, said Ms. Hathloul’s release was welcome news: “She is a powerful advocate for women’s rights, and releasing her was the right thing to do.”</td>

      <td>Released in conjunction with her movie of the same name, the pop artist’s new album is feel-good albeit generic.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />Sia Furler’s life in music has followed a strange and winding path. The Australian-born artist, now age 45, spent the 1990s and early ’00s in relative obscurity, playing with a few bands, landing the occasional guest vocal, and releasing a handful of solo records as simply Sia. Back then, much of her own work was loose and jazzy folk-pop, including “Breathe Me,” which in 2005 memorably provided the soundtrack for the closing scene from the acclaimed HBO series “Six Feet Under.” Later in that decade, she began writing for other singers and turned out to be very good at it. She topped the charts as a songwriter with Rihanna’s 2012 smash “Diamonds” and used that momentum to reboot her solo career. Her own hits, and those she’s written for others, represent an influential approach to pop craftsmanship, one in which hugely catchy melodic phrases are married to uplifting lyrics to generate anthems about empowerment.<br />Ms. Furler’s success as a songwriter has afforded her an opportunity to work in other mediums. “Music” (Atlantic / Monkey Puzzle), her ninth studio album, out Friday, is a companion to a film of the same name that she co-wrote and directed. It stars Kate Hudson, Leslie Odom Jr. and dancer Maddie Ziegler, who has appeared in many of Ms. Furler’s music videos, in a story about a child on the autism spectrum named Music. Following her grandmother’s death, the girl, played by Ms. Ziegler, is suddenly thrust into the care of her troubled sister (Ms. Hudson), a former drug dealer who is herself struggling to survive. (The movie has drawn fire for being insensitive in its handling of autism, and also in its casting, with some activists suggesting the title role should have gone to an actor with the condition.) The drama unfolds alongside elaborately staged fantasy sequences representing Music’s internal life.</td>

      <td>Sales have been surging since stores reopened and company had been bringing back many workers who were furloughed in April</td>
      <td>Best Buy Co.  notified workers this week that it was cutting some jobs at its big box stores, according to people familiar with the situation, as the retailer adapts to a world where more shopping happens online.<br />The company has reported skyrocketing sales in recent quarters as pandemic-weary shoppers stock up on appliances, videogame systems and other electronics. Comparable sales, those from websites or stores operating for at least 12 months, rose 23% in the quarter ended Oct. 31. Much of the gains came from online orders, which nearly tripled in the U.S. in the last quarter.<br />A spokesman for the company declined to comment on the details of the job cuts. “As we have said before, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital,” said the spokesman. “Our workforce will need to evolve to meet the evolving needs of customers while providing more flexible opportunities for our people.”<br />The company had 125,000 full-time and part-time workers as of January 2020. Best Buy furloughed about 51,000 of its workers early in April, including nearly all its part-time employees, as it closed most of its stores early in the pandemic to all but curbside pickup. In June, Best Buy began bringing back furloughed workers and in August raised its starting wage to $15 an hour.<br />After reporting strong third-quarter sales, executives said in November that the outlook was uncertain for the rest of the year. The company said it would resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter and close all its stores in Mexico, its smallest market. The company reports full year earnings Feb. 25.</td>

      <td>Iranian breaches of the 2015 nuclear deal raise fears that the country is paving the way to start work on nuclear weapons, raising pressure on President Biden</td>
      <td>Iran has in recent months repeatedly violated the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reducing the time it would need to produce a nuclear weapon. The violations, a response to U.S. sanctions imposed after former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact in 2018, have put at risk the survival of an agreement that helped remove sanctions on Iran and open it to business with the West.<br />The latest development was revealed on Feb. 10 when the International Atomic Energy Agency told member states in a confidential report that Iran had begun producing uranium metal, a material vital for nuclear weapons. Iran had told the agency in mid-December that it planned to produce uranium metal, but that production would require four to five months to install the equipment to produce the powder from which uranium metal is made. Iran has said it would produce uranium metal for civilian purposes, though the uranium metal produced this month might not be related to this work.<br />In January, Iran made one of its biggest steps yet to breach the 2015 deal, announcing it had begun enriching uranium at 20% purity. That crossed a red line previously set by European powers that are still party to the accord.<br />The most recent disclosure of uranium metal production—which has limited civilian utility—has stirred concern among Western officials over whether Iran is preparing to restart work toward a nuclear weapon.<br />Uranium metal is often used in the core of nuclear weapons. Production of the material is a clear breach of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers, in which it agreed to a 15-year moratorium on uranium and plutonium metallurgical production.</td>

Core prices were also flat in December after a downward revision to the earlier estimate.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.1% increase in core prices in January.<br />Overall, the data indicates that “there’s just no real significant underlying inflationary pressure,” said Thomas Simons, senior vice president and money-market economist in the fixed-income group at Jefferies LLC.</td>

While widespread shelter-in-place orders crippled Uber’s rides business, its food-delivery arm thrived as the same mandates kept people from going to restaurants. Revenue for the year declined 14% to $11.13 billion.<br />Uber overhauled its business during the health crisis, cutting a quarter of its staff and shedding noncore businesses, among other moves, leading to $1 billion in savings on fixed expenses last year.<br />The company’s fourth-quarter revenue declined 16% to $3.16 billion. The net loss for the period narrowed to $968 million from $1.09 billion in the year-earlier quarter.<br />Uber’s adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization also narrowed in the latest quarter to $454 million, compared with a loss of $615 million a year earlier. Uber has said it expects to become profitable by this measure by the end of this year.</td>

      <td>The author of ‘Detransition, Baby: A Novel,’ on how a vintage trench coat lined with nutria—or giant swamp rats—became her style trademark</td>
      <td>AUTHORS OFTEN become identified with an item of clothing—Zadie Smith, for instance, is known for her head wraps, and Fran Lebowitz is never without a blazer—so I have taken the pre-emptive step of wearing, everywhere I go, a long black vintage trench coat lined with the fur of nutria. For those of you who have never encountered them, nutria are giant swamp rats. It is the perfect coat for queer nightlife in New York City. You can put it on over a little outfit to stay warm and modest for the train ride; the boring raincoat exterior hides the fur so you don’t offend the vegans. And the coat doubles as bedding if you crash on someone’s couch. I own this perfect coat as a result of a long family saga and two failed fashion fur fads, one in the 1950s and one in the 1990s.<br />My mom grew up in the 1950s on a chinchilla farm just beyond the Minneapolis suburbs. My grandparents called their little enterprise a “ranch”—in actual fact, it was 300 of the fuzzy South American creatures nuzzling around in the basement of their two-story farmhouse. Chinchillas have more hair per square inch than almost any other mammal. Humans grow one to three hairs per follicle, chinchillas grow up to 75. The abundance of hair on a chinchilla made its fur a status item at the turn of the 20th century. Trappers hunted the chinchilla to near extinction in its native Andes. In the 1910s, the Chilean government attempted to conserve the last few chinchillas by trapping them alive to sell to breeders. In all, 132 of the animals made their way to the U.S. A colony of chinchillas was not found in the wild again until the 1970s.<br />After World War II, breeders in the U.S. began to market the animals not as pelts, but as a get-rich-quick scheme. They targeted young couples with claims that chinchillas could be raised with minimal effort in spare spaces around the home. At the time, my grandparents told me, a chinchilla pelt, still a rare luxury, could sell for over $100. My grandparents fell for it. They drove to Colorado and paid $3,000 for three mating pairs—more than they’d paid for their car. Other couples did the same, and the price plummeted in a chinchilla fur glut. My grandparents spent the next 16 years, my mother’s entire childhood, attempting to recoup their investment. My grandmother never earned enough money to own a chinchilla-fur coat herself.<br />My mom promised herself that when she could afford a fur coat, she’d buy one, to take pleasure in what had been only labor in her childhood. But by the 1990s, when she could afford it, fur coats had become suspect. One did not waltz around in fur in the ’90s without the risk of being shamed or even spray-painted.<br />At the same time, nutria, the large invasive South American rodents, were posing a serious environmental threat to the fragile wetlands of Louisiana. Traders brought nutria to the U.S. in the 1930s and some of the pests escaped into Louisiana’s swamps. The non-native animals eat the plants that hold the bottom soil together, leading to dangerous erosion. Louisiana began paying a $5 bounty for each nutria slain, and hunters often neglected to properly dispose of the bodies, leaving them in the swamps. Fashion furriers, noting this, began to buy the pelts to market as a “guilt-free” fur. Why not wear what would otherwise decay?</td>

To use uranium metal, Iran would need around half a kilogram, or slightly more than one pound, of highly enriched uranium metal.<br />The Iranian government in December warned that it could start producing uranium metal within five months, following a law passed in Iran’s Parliament on Dec. 1, a threat that alarmed Western diplomats.<br />Iran has taken a series of recent steps in breach of the nuclear accord. It has increased its production of nuclear fuel, carried out enrichment in new sites and earlier this year produced 20% enriched uranium, the highest purity of the material it has made since 2013.</td>

In its Spring 2021 press presentation last November, retail site Net-a-Porter reported that, based on its sales data, customers were drifting away from faddish seasonal pieces and toward luxury classics, like eternally chic Saint Laurent blazers and sleek-but-relaxed pants from the Row. Key factors: All the time we’re spending at home (there’s no point trying to impress a cat with zeitgeisty trendiness) and a heightened awareness of how “in one season, out the next” clothing creates waste.<br />All this is driving women to invest in heirloom-quality clothing that will last not just for a few years, but for the next generation.

The U.S. will announce the first rounds of sanctions targets this week, Mr. Biden said.<br />In addition, the U.S. is taking steps to prevent the military leaders of Myanmar from accessing about $1 billion in Burmese funds held in the U.S. by freezing those assets, Mr. Biden said.<br />In remarks at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Biden called on the military to release activists and political leaders, including popular civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi of the National League for Democracy. Alluding to widespread protests, he said: “Violence against those asserting their democratic rights is unacceptable, and we’re going to keep calling it out.”</td>

By a 5-2 vote, the board scrapped the merit-based system that made Lowell an educational treasure.<br />On Twitter, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Heather Knight has more   on Tuesday’s meeting of the people who for some reason have been given control of the San Francisco Unified School District:<br />A full seven hours into the meeting, the board finally got around to addressing the question of school reopenings. But much remains in doubt. Last week this column noted that the San Francisco city attorney, Dennis Herrera, has sued the board for having no reopening plan. This week the board reached a tentative deal with unions representing school employees, but it’s unclear when kids will return to classrooms and how  often they’ll be able to receive instruction in person.</td>

      <td>The U.S. budget gap totaled a record $736 billion during the first four months of fiscal 2021, Treasury says</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal spending climbed last month as the U.S. Treasury issued another round of stimulus checks and other federal aid following a December economic relief deal in Congress, widening the budget deficit for the fiscal year.<br />The U.S. budget gap totaled a record $736 billion during the first four months of fiscal 2021, an 89% increase compared with the same period a year earlier, as government spending outpaced revenue, the Treasury Department said Wednesday. Receipts totaled nearly $1.2 trillion, a 1% rise and a record from October through January, while outlays increased a record 23%, to $1.9 trillion, largely due to higher spending on safety-net programs such as jobless benefits and Medicaid.<br />For the 12 months that ended in January, the deficit totaled $3.47 trillion, or 16.2% as a share of economic output.<br />A surge of spending to combat the coronavirus pandemic and cushion the U.S. economy from the related downturn, coupled with weaker tax revenues, has sent deficits soaring over the past year to levels not seen since the end of World War II. Rising red ink is now at the center of a debate in Congress over whether lawmakers should approve more spending to bolster the economy, and support households and businesses until the pandemic is brought under control.<br />Congress enacted a roughly $900 billion bill at the end of December that began to take effect last month, boosting federal spending at the start of 2021. Among the costliest provisions was $142 billion in stimulus payments, of which $139 billion were made in January, the Treasury said, and $25 billion in rental-assistance grants to state and local governments.</td>

      <td>Some designers opt for two dining-room tables to shake things up and diversify the function of an underused room. Others find the look cold, or worse. Here, both sides.</td>
      <td>For the recurring series, That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and other emphatically opposed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />A single Downton Abbey- sized dining table is so last century, argue advocates for multiple tables in a dining room. “Clients tell us that the dining room is often one of the best rooms in the house but hardly gets used,” said Joe Nahem, a designer in New York. Modern families—especially during a pandemic—expect this space to tick a lot of boxes. A second table can function as a desk, kids’ craft area or a forum for jigsaw-puzzling. “Put bookshelves in the room and it becomes more than just a dining room,” said Benjamin Noriega-Ortiz, another New York designer. When only two or four people sit for dinner, a “four top” suffices, without leaving you with a disconcerting airfield of unused surface. When full-on dinner parties return, you can push the tables together. Or, other designers note, a hosting couple can divide and conquer, with each presiding over a more intimate group. “At one long table, conversations happen in smaller groups anyway,” said New York designer Kristen McGinnis. Mr. Noriega-Ortiz likes to mix styles and shapes so the resulting arrangement is “homey and doesn’t feel like you’re in a conference room.” In one project, he surrounded two pedestal tables with built-in seating, woven rush chairs and a modern Windsor chair. Mr. Nahem dispels conference-room connotations with a rug, big enough to embrace both seating arrangements. Of course, one needs a large, if not mansion-esque, room, he said, “maybe 12 by 18 feet.”<br />Sacrifice grand, center-of-the-room chandeliers. Overhead lighting, mounted flush or close to the ceiling, should illuminate both tables whether they are united or split apart.<br />It felt like a lobby of a hotel,” recalled Viktor Udzenija of a residential London dining room in which he and other guests were seated at multiple tables. Mr. Udzenija, an architect and interior designer with offices in Prague and Dubai, found the seating arrangement not only impersonal but embittering: Every time laughter broke out at a nearby table, he endured a case of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out, a condition more commonly induced by social media). His credo? “One table, no matter how big, is more inclusive, grand and [better] represents the idea of coming together.” In cases where a two-person household has a 10-foot table, Christopher Coleman, of Miami’s Sanchez + Coleman Studio, sees an opportunity to put blessedly beautiful possessions on exhibit. “One client had a collection of interesting candlesticks—all different sizes and materials—that took up a third of the table, another had stacks of books and we have a collection of 30 glass vases on ours,” he said. “You can still seat four to six people without moving [the objets].” Those who don’t want to dedicate a lot of square footage to a large table should invest in a smaller one with removable leaves. Designer Michelle Gerson of New York looks for “intentional” leaves that come together in a purposeful metal strip versus “ugly seams.”<br />Ms. Gerson feels diplomacy always dictates one table over two. That way, she said, “no one is hurt thinking they are at the good table or the bad table or the A table or the B table.”</td>

Mr. Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to lose the state since 1992; the loss was confirmed by two statewide recounts and a partial forensic audit.<br />The letters didn’t mention Mr. Trump by name but referred to media reports of contacts with the Georgia secretary of state’s office, the U.S. attorney’s office in Atlanta and others—indicating the probe is focused on the post-election efforts by Mr. Trump and his supporters to reverse his loss in the state.<br />Ms. Willis sent the notices to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who are all Republicans, according to a spokesman for the district attorney and copies obtained by The Wall Street Journal. The spokesman said he could confirm the investigation had been opened but couldn’t name the subjects of the probe.</td>

      <td>Richard Goldberg and Jonathan Schanzer’s “The U.N. Refugee Agency With Few Actual Refugees” (op-ed, Feb. 4) exhibits a deep misunderstanding of the agency it criticizes. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (Unrwa) is the only U.N. body mandated to deliver humanitarian assistance, health care, education and protection to Palestine refugees living in the Middle East today. Contrary to the authors’ claims, under international law and the principle of family unity the children of Palestine refugees and their descendants are also considered refugees until a durable solution is found. Both Unrwa and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recognize descendants as refugees on this basis.<br />Governments around the world acknowledge Unrwa’s work is an important part of maintaining regional stability until a lasting political solution is found. In December 2019, when Unrwa’s U.N. mandate was up for its regular three-year renewal, member states voted overwhelmingly in support of renewing Unrwa’s mandate, recognizing the agency as a vital source of stability in a region rife with ongoing conflict.<br />Unrwa doesn’t perpetuate refugee status in the Middle East. Responsibility for the protracted nature of the plight of Palestine refugees lies squarely and clearly with the parties to the conflict. Eroding or erasing Unrwa doesn’t solve the refugee problem. It will, however, ensure that more than 530,000 children cannot attend school; that some 140 health clinics cannot provide vaccines; and more than one million refugees in Gaza don’t get food assistance. Destroying those services and programs is hardly a step toward peace and security.<br />Elizabeth Campbell<br />Unrwa</td>

She declined to say when the budget would be released or in what form.<br />Mr. Biden’s advisers raised concerns publicly in December that staff in Mr. Trump’s budget office had rebuffed requests for information necessary to help them prepare to take over the government.<br />Yohannes Abraham, then a senior Biden transition official, said OMB officials hadn’t shared sufficient details on “Covid-related expenditures” and were refusing to work with the incoming administration on developing a budget.<br />An OMB spokesman said at the time the department had provided Mr. Biden’s team with “everything they have requested,” including briefings on the government’s initiative to distribute a Covid-19 vaccine. The spokesman added that it was “not an OMB transition responsibility” to help Mr. Biden’s team draft budget proposals.

      <td>Chances are in the past few weeks someone has given you a stock tip—maybe to buy bitcoin or invest in  GameStop .  In part because of Covid-induced boredom, the country is witnessing an unprecedented interest in financial speculation. This craze is fueled by business celebrities like Elon Musk, who announced Monday that his company Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin. Last Thursday Mr. Musk tweeted in support of the cryptocurrency dogecoin, which was created as a joke in 2013.<br />What is the average investor to make of all this? When stocks shift by hundreds of percentage points in a day, there’s only so much the government can do to protect you. Instead, investors should look past the tweets and Reddit posts and get back to fundamentals.<br />Yes, even bitcoin has fundamentals. There are two stories you can tell about Mr. Musk’s promotion of bitcoin. The first is a cynical one, in which he is using his media platform to pump an inherently speculative asset that he will dump, enriching himself at others’ expense.<br />The second story is honorable: Mr. Musk has keyed in on bitcoin’s value as an asset that can’t be manipulated by central banks. He understands bitcoin’s fixed supply, and in a world of seemingly unlimited monetary stimulus he’d like to promote the separation of money and state. The value of all money, even traditional currencies, is determined in part by public demand, and Mr. Musk’s driving up bitcoin’s price is no scandal in itself. Perhaps that’s what he meant when he tweeted, “Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money.”<br />Though bitcoin may be rising on a thin wave of enthusiasm, its fundamentals have real value. I teach a course on cryptocurrency, and I urge my students to look past the allure of easy money and focus on the philosophy, technology and political economy that differentiate bitcoin and its peers from traditional currencies.</td>

And perhaps we were too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time,” she told the European Parliament on Wednesday.<br />The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, has come under intense criticism in recent weeks for how it has handled contracts on behalf of the EU’s 27 countries, after several pharmaceutical companies announced production shortages that further delay an already slow vaccination campaign in Europe.<br />The bloc is trailing far behind Israel, the U.K. and the U.S. with just 3.9 vaccinations per 100 inhabitants, in part because of a slow market-authorization process and patchy logistics. In addition, producers of the Oxford- AstraZeneca ,   Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have announced delays in deliveries to the EU.<br />Ms. von der Leyen defended the unprecedented decision by the bloc’s governments to centralize purchases, amid calls from some politicians in her native Germany to order vaccines on a national basis.</td>

Demand and production in the industrial sector were both weighed down, hitting commodity prices.<br />Now, driven by improved domestic demand and rising prices for crude oil, iron ore and other raw materials, Chinese producer prices rose 1.0% in January compared with a month earlier, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday.<br />With industrial production and demand continuing to improve, China’s producer-price index will likely remain in positive territory for the rest of the year, said Zhang Ning, an economist at UBS.</td>

      <td>The music industry distanced itself from the rising country star—but his latest album tops the charts. What the industry’s moves mean for his career and country music</td>
      <td>Before Big Loud Records suspended Morgan Wallen last week for making a racial slur, the 27-year-old singer was on his way to becoming country music’s next big superstar. Music executives say he ticked all of Nashville’s boxes: a compelling voice, well-crafted songs about small towns, drinking and relationships, a commercial sound made for radio and a little old-school swagger. Most importantly, he became a streaming giant—a rarity in country music, which historically has lagged behind hip-hop and other genres on streaming services.<br />His rapid rise appeared to falter last week after the East Tennessee star was captured on video calling one of the people in his group of friends the N-word as he said goodnight. (The video started circulating on Tuesday evening.) Mr. Wallen apologized immediately. But the reaction was just as swift: On Wednesday country-music radio stations dropped him from the airwaves and streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music removed him from important playlists, though he remained searchable. WME, his talent agency, dropped him, according to a spokesperson. Many believed the distancing would lay a blow to his streaming prospects.<br />On Sunday, however, Mr. Wallen’s latest album, “Dangerous,” hit No. 1 on Billboard’s all-genre album sales chart for the fourth straight week since its release—which hasn’t happened for a country album in about 18 years. Early indications suggest it could be No. 1 again next week. Music-industry experts answered key questions about Mr. Wallen and what the controversy means (and doesn’t mean) for country music:<br />It’s still early days. But Mr. Wallen’s sales are steady and even rising, albeit with some caveats.<br />Billboard’s album chart tracks numbers from Friday to Thursday. Mr. Wallen’s album “Dangerous” moved 149,000 “equivalent-album units” in the latest week ending Thursday, Feb. 4, a measurement that includes U.S. sales and streaming. That’s up 14% from the previous week.</td>

      <td>Fears of suppression grow, given the military’s history of deadly violence against pro-democracy demonstrations</td>
      <td>Protesters in Myanmar poured into the streets for the fifth straight day Wednesday to oppose last week’s military coup, despite an escalating use of force by authorities.<br />A day earlier, police fired gunshots to disperse protesters, and used rubber bullets and water cannons, causing injuries and raising fears of harsher suppression. The United Nations expressed strong concern over Tuesday’s police action, saying the use of disproportionate force was unacceptable, and the U.S. condemned violence against demonstrators.<br />Tens of thousands of people have participated in street rallies and marches against the Feb. 1 takeover. The coup ended a democratic shift in the country that began a decade ago and abruptly put Myanmar back into the hands of the military, which has ruled it for much of the past seven decades since independence from British colonial rule. In past years of army domination, security forces relied on arrests, batons, militias and guns to put down pro-democracy uprisings.<br />Protesters are demanding that the military release hugely popular civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whom they detained as her government was deposed, and hand back power. In a speech Monday night, the leader of the coup, military chief Min Aung Hlaing, promised to build a “genuine and disciplined democratic system.” New elections would be held, he said, though it isn’t known what the terms of any such vote would be.<br />Signs that authorities might use greater force to suppress protests have been growing since Monday. As demonstrations surged in towns and cities throughout Myanmar, an ominous message appeared on state television, saying action would be taken against those who were disturbing the country’s stability and that lawbreakers shouldn’t be tolerated. Later, authorities effectively banned protests in parts of the country’s two largest cities, Yangon and Mandalay.</td>

Payment company  Square Inc.,  which Mr. Dorsey also leads, recently acquired about $50 million worth of bitcoin for its corporate treasury.<br />Mr. Segal’s comments came days after electric-vehicle maker  Tesla Inc.  said it had purchased $1.5 billion in bitcoin.

That will fuel a debate, already under way, over whether the large amount of Covid-19 relief coming out of Washington adds up to more than the economy can safely handle.<br />What the debate might hinge on is the answer to one question: How long will higher inflation persist?<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that consumer prices rose 0.3% last month from December, putting them 1.4% above their year-earlier level. Prices excluding food and energy items—the so-called core aimed at better reflecting inflation’s underlying trend—were up 1.4% from a year earlier.<br />So for now inflation is well below the 2% the Federal Reserve is aiming for, especially considering that the Commerce Department inflation gauge the central bank favors runs cooler than the Labor Department’s.<br />But with Covid-19 cases already down significantly from a month ago while millions of Americans are getting vaccinated each week, the pandemic’s hold on the country could be far looser by the time spring arrives. As people lower their caution levels and restrictions ease, spending on services such as travel and restaurants could surge. And people will have a substantial amount of money to spend.</td>

      <td>As Americans tee up in record numbers this winter, resorts and clubs—from Oregon to North Dakota—are offering warmer-than-usual welcomes, with heated golf carts, shorter courses and a lot of whiskey</td>
      <td>THIS TIME of year, many golfers swap rounds on the course for rounds on the couch, unless they’re heading to Florida or Arizona. But 2021 looks different: Thanks to milder temperatures in January and Americans’ persistent desire to get outside amid the continuing pandemic, golf courses around the country have been experiencing an unexpected boon. They’re also adapting to this hardier breed of duffers, offering a warmer-than-usual welcome via heated golf carts, shorter courses and expanded whiskey menus.<br />“What we’re seeing this winter, particularly in colder markets, is an extension of what we’ve experienced throughout 2020...more new people enjoying the game than we’ve seen in a long time,” said PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, a Boston native who’s always considered golf a year-round sport.<br />Golf’s inherently socially distanced nature is fueling its surge in popularity. Total rounds played in the U.S. in 2020 were up 37% in December year over year, according to the research firm Golf Datatech.<br />Lena Land, 50, and Grace Lapena, 64, are part of the motivated year-round golfing crew. The two friends are committed to playing golf every week at their home course of Brasada Canyons outside Bend, Ore. One dreary mid-January day, it rained for 90 minutes during their round, but they still finished 18 holes. Mrs. Land, who battled breast cancer last year, said she’s excited to feel healthy again and not about to let weather stop her. “They won’t let us on the course in the snow; otherwise we’d get colored balls and give it a try,” she said.<br />Other courses don’t mind a little frost. Elsewhere in Oregon, Silvies Valley Ranch, a golf and spa resort in Seneca opted to stay open through winter for only the second time and is offering a “cool golf” option ($45 per person). Guests use high-loft clubs, whose higher launch angle makes them easier to hit, and neon-green tennis balls, more readily spotted in the snow, so players can move briskly around a five-hole course. Each green is equipped with extra-large cups, introducing a new kind of putting challenge. Winter bookings at the Ranch are up more than 200% from last year.</td>

      <td>Social-media company says it lowering the visibility of political content to promote healthier communities and suit users who don’t want to see it</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.  said it is beginning to reduce how much political content users see in their news feeds, potentially diminishing the role that the world’s largest social network plays in elections and civil discourse more broadly.<br />The announcement, made in a Wednesday blog post, follows Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s declaration on the company’s earnings call last month that most users wanted to see less political content. He said at the time that cutting back on politics would allow Facebook to “do a better job of helping to bring people together and helping to promote healthier communities.”<br />Facebook says that political content currently constitutes only 6% of what people see on the platform. It will begin running experiments to reduce that amount for a small percentage of people in Canada, Brazil and Indonesia immediately, with tests in the U.S. in weeks to come.<br />The company said it isn’t removing political content but rather exploring ways to reduce the exposure for users who would prefer not to see it. In practice, that means Facebook will still allow users to post about politics and argue among friends, but its algorithms will de-prioritize those conversations and spread them less widely across the network, especially for people who have not expressed interest in those topics.<br />The company didn’t specify how it will define political content.</td>

      <td>In 2019, there was the United Auto Workers strike; in 2020, the pandemic lockdowns; and in 2021, a shortage of semiconductors. It is fortunate that investors have come to see General Motors as a growth stock, otherwise they might worry more about its meager cash flows.<br />The largest U.S. auto maker by sales said Wednesday that it expected the global microchip shortage to cost it between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion in free cash this year.  Ford  made a similar projection when it reported quarterly results last week. Combined with high capital spending, the problem will reduce GM’s adjusted automotive free cash flow to just $1 billion-to-$2 billion in 2021, according to its internal forecasts. Its shares sank 6% in morning trading.<br />Last year, the company generated automotive free cash flow of $2.6 billion. The pandemic lockdowns that closed factories across the world caused GM surprisingly little financial trauma across 2020 as a whole—by most metrics, less than the shutdowns caused by the 40-day strike the previous year. One reason for that resilience was a strong rebound in vehicle demand in its key U.S. market. Another was tight financial management, including delaying some capital spending.<br />The tab for capital expenditures in 2021 will be correspondingly larger: The company expects to fork out between $9 billion and $10 billion, up from just $5.3 billion in 2020 and a pre-pandemic $7.5 billion in 2019. Catch-up spending isn’t the only reason; GM also is accelerating investments in electric and driverless vehicles. Last month, it made headlines with an aspiration to phase out tailpipe emissions from its light-duty vehicles entirely by 2035.<br />The company has attracted huge attention and a soaring stock-market valuation with its bullish EV plans, but the big gap in its pitch to Wall Street is a cutting-edge EV in car showrooms. The first vehicles GM will launch on its much-hyped Ultium battery platform, the Hummer truck and the Cadillac Lyric, are both slated for the 2022 model year.</td>

      <td>President has moved to undo many of Trump’s immigration policies, but curb on program prized by employers remains in effect</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Business groups and immigrant advocates say they are worried that a ban imposed last year on most forms of legal immigration in response to the Covid-19 pandemic could stick even as President Biden undoes many of his predecessor’s other immigration policies.<br />The ban, which former President Donald Trumpput in place in April and expanded in June, was intended to block the entry of foreigners who might take open jobs while U.S. unemployment was soaring. It covers workers in a range of industries—from tech and consulting to landscaping and seasonal resorts—along with most family members of U.S. citizens looking to immigrate.<br />During the campaign, Mr. Biden criticized the ban several times, writing in one June tweet that it was “yet another attempt to distract” from the Trump administration’s pandemic response: “The President can’t scapegoat his way out of this crisis.”<br />Mr. Biden has signed executive orders halting construction of Mr. Trump’s border wall and ending a ban on travel from several countries, including a number of Muslim-majority nations, but he hasn’t mentioned the legal-immigration ban.<br />It is set to expire at the end of March if not renewed, but several industry representatives say that is too long to wait, given the impact the ban is having. Business groups that argued during the Trump administration that the ban disrupted companies’ operations and slowed the country’s economic recovery are now offering another objection.</td>

But now, new uncertainties from a tax controversy threaten to keep the stock on ice.<br />While at-home sales have remained strong, out-of-home sales in places like restaurants, bars and sports venues have plummeted. As a result, Coca-Cola has been hit much harder by the coronavirus pandemic than rival  PepsiCo ,  which has a huge snacking business well suited to the stay-at-home economy. Over the past year, Coca-Cola shares are down around 16%, compared with a 4% decline for Pepsi.<br />The flip side is that Coca-Cola’s sales are primed for a stronger rebound as vaccinations continue and economies reopen. The company reported Wednesday that organic sales declined 3% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, in line with analyst estimates, according to Visible Alpha. That was an improvement from the 26% and 6% declines in the second and third quarters, respectively.<br />It was especially encouraging that having previously declined to give guidance while citing “known unknowns” around the pandemic, the company is now comfortable enough to guide for organic sales growth in the high single digits in 2021.<br />But a new unknown has arisen: On Nov. 18, a U.S. Tax Court judge ruled that the company placed too much of its profit in its lower-tax foreign operations. The ruling didn’t determine how much the company owes, but the Internal Revenue Service had been seeking more than $3.3 billion for the tax years 2007 through 2009.</td>

Left the insurance companies in charge. The $831 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment stimulus bill from 2009? Too small and too timid. The Dodd-Frank financial overhaul? Not tough enough on big banks. The progressive message to Mr. Biden: Don’t make that mistake again.<br />That tension between Mr. Obama’s legacy and Mr. Biden’s agenda is at the heart of a fight over who should run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, regulator of most of the country’s biggest banks. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Mr. Biden is considering nominating University of Michigan public policy professor Michael Barr.<br />Activists on the left are trying to derail that nomination. With Mr. Biden prioritizing diversity, they are pushing Mehrsa Baradaran, a University of California, Irvine, law professor who has written on the racial wealth gap and is an immigrant from Iran. She has the support of Senate Banking Committee chairman Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), an advocate of breaking up the biggest banks.<br />They are also attacking Mr. Barr’s record as too friendly to financial companies when he negotiated the Dodd-Frank law while serving in Mr. Obama’s Treasury Department, and since. In fact their complaints about Mr. Barr are really a proxy for a broader indictment: that Mr. Obama missed a chance to fundamentally remake the financial system along more populist lines. But this relies on a selective reading of history that misjudges the complexity of the financial system and thus the challenges facing the people who oversee it.</td>

      <td>Beverage giant says worse-than-expected winter squeezed profit and revenue, but it predicts consumers will bounce back in second half of 2021</td>
      <td>The pandemic has been worse this winter than  Coca-Cola Co.  expected, but the beverage giant said it expects consumers to return to normal life in the second half of the year as Covid-19 vaccines roll out across many developed countries.<br />The company offered an outlook for 2021, saying the first half of the year would be challenging. Starting in December, “we saw more restrictions in place than we anticipated,” finance chief John Murphy said in an interview. But “we still think that with vaccine rollout building momentum in the coming weeks, the second half of the year will be very strong.”<br />“We also think there’s a pent-up demand on the part of people to get out and about,” he added. “There’s more light at the end of the tunnel this year.”<br />Coke expects high-single-digit percentage growth in organic revenue, which excludes currency swings and acquisitions or divestitures, in 2021. On that basis, Coke’s revenue fell 9% in 2020.<br />The company reported declines in both profit and revenue in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. Depressed sales from restaurants and bars more than offset gains from consumers drinking sodas at home. The company said world-wide volumes fell 3% in the fourth quarter.</td>

      <td>On the table in 25 minutes, this beef chow fun recipe gets its invigorating twist from fresh horseradish</td>
      <td>AS A CHILD, Brandon Jew looked forward to dinners out, which almost always featured an order of beef chow fun. It’s the sort of Chinese-American classic Mr. Jew celebrates today at his restaurant Mister Jiu’s, in San Francisco. After a brief hiatus, Mister Jiu’s will reopen next month, and the revamped menu will include the beloved beef-noodle stir-fry, which the chef has perfected during lockdown. “It’s my comfort food,” he said.<br />At the restaurant, the staff will make the rice noodles from scratch and marinate thinly sliced sirloin for two days in Shaoxing wine, sesame oil and oyster sauce. At home Mr. Jew makes this far speedier version, his first Slow Food Fast recipe.<br />A key step: cooking the noodles over high heat just long enough to brown them in spots. “It adds so much texture and flavor,” Mr. Jew said. Then they get a vigorous tossing with seared beef, chopped broccolini, bean sprouts and scallions until everything is coated in a sweet-savory brown sauce. It’s worth seeking out fresh horseradish root to grate over the dish before serving—a small gesture that really makes this chow fun pop. Mr. Jew’s hankering for it remains as strong as ever. “I just made this for dinner over the weekend,” he said. “I had a craving.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

      <td>Boeing 737-500 plunged into Java Sea with 62 on board, setting off an investigation into the cause</td>
      <td>Investigators in Indonesia are seeking to uncover why a Sriwijaya Air jet crashed into the sea shortly after taking off on Jan. 9. The incident involving a  Boeing  737-500 came more than two years after a Lion Air plane went down in the country, resulting in 189 deaths.<br />The Sriwijaya Air jet crashed into the Java Sea minutes after it took off from Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta. It was carrying 62 people, including 10 children, on a domestic flight to Pontianak, a city on Indonesia’s Borneo island.<br />The plane departed at 2:36 p.m. and climbed to a maximum altitude of 10,900 feet about four minutes later before beginning a steep descent, according to Indonesian investigators. It went missing at 2:40 p.m.<br />Divers and search crew located debris from the plane and human remains around an area known as the Thousand Islands, to the north of Jakarta. There were no survivors.<br />Investigations are under way and, at this stage, rely in large part on information downloaded from the flight-data recorder. That is one of the plane’s two so-called black boxes and was retrieved a few days after the aircraft went down.</td>

Demand from individual investors has driven Blip’s comparably inexpensive billboard ads up to 20 times its usual rate since Jan. 30, Mr. Tingey said, with a meme-stocks-related ad appearing every 2.5 seconds on its billboards nationwide.<br />“When this hit, it was over the weekend and, man, our website traffic just went nuts, with a 1,900% increase in traffic to that site,” he said. “They just blew it up.”</td>

      <td>The grand experiment of blocking the middle seat on airplanes has proved what we have known all along about air travel: More people care about a cheap fare than comfort, or even pandemic safety.<br />Delta announced on Monday that it was extending its middle-seat block for one more month, to the end of April. Delta, the last U.S. airline to block all middle seats in coach, will consider further extensions based on Covid-19 transmission and vaccination rates.<br />So far, Delta thinks it’s earning goodwill and confidence with customers, particularly business travelers, who aren’t traveling now but will come back. Some who’ve flown during the pandemic have been willing to pay Delta more for more space onboard. Most have been price-sensitive leisure travelers willing to sit shoulder-to-shoulder for cheap fares—on airlines not blocking middle seats.<br />“This is really about playing the long game and making sure that we are positioning this brand for greater success coming out of the pandemic,” says Bill Lentsch, Delta’s chief customer experience officer.<br />The bottom line for Delta during the pandemic has been bigger losses than rival airlines selling all their seats. Delta was the most profitable U.S. airline in the final six months of 2019. That flipped during the pandemic. In the last six months of 2020, Delta had the biggest losses, with a net loss of more than $6 billion, greater than United and Southwest combined.</td>

      <td>Pilots twice reported problems with automated engine controls on a Sriwijaya Air jet days before a malfunction involving the same system played a major role in the plane’s fatal January crash in Indonesia, according to the country’s investigators.<br />The preliminary report about the accident, which killed all 62 people on board and is likely to stoke new concerns about Indonesia’s air-safety record, indicates the cockpit crew didn’t recover the plane from a steep bank and sudden dive four minutes after takeoff. Investigators said that the upset came after the auto-throttle system, which is designed to automatically adjust fuel flow and thrust, failed to operate properly.<br />That means the pilots either didn’t recognize the problem or failed to deal with it in time, experts said.<br />Thrust from the left engine reduced as intended while the plane was climbing away from the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta, but thrust from the other engine didn’t, the report said. When the plane neared 11,000 feet—with the engines continuing to operate at significantly different power settings—it went from a normal nose-up position to a dangerously unstable, nose-down one within five seconds, it said.<br />The jet’s flight-data recorder—one of its so-called black boxes—stopped operating 20 seconds later, suggesting that this was  roughly when the plane hit the water.</td>

      <td>Groups who organize online and target a specific asset are a staple of the crypto world</td>
      <td>The flash mob that drove up the price of  GameStop Corp.  and other heavily shorted stocks took Wall Street by surprise. In the cryptocurrency market, such behavior is commonplace.<br />Groups of investors who organize on social media and target a specific asset—often one small and illiquid enough to be easily influenced—are a staple of the crypto world. Although digital currencies have made inroads with professional investors, they are also still subject to pumping schemes that proliferate on social-media platforms like Discord and Telegram.<br />The prevalence of such ploys, going back nearly a decade to the early days of the crypto industry, suggest that the mania surrounding GameStop on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum may not be an isolated event in the stock market. A similar, temporary spike also occurred last week in the silver market.<br />“It’s definitely an awakening of small retail traders that there’s power in numbers, and that’s come from crypto,” said Kain Warwick, the founder of Synthetix, a crypto-focused derivatives platform. “We realized that a long time ago.”<br />Another similarity between crypto and WallStreetBets: Free tools, like online trading apps and message boards, promote what early bitcoin adapters called the democratization of finance. Bitcoin was created 12 years ago as a decentralized currency that would be free from the interference of bankers and other middlemen.</td>

They have more than doubled in the past 12 months, gaining more than 30% since the start of 2021.<br />The rally has turned the liquor company into one of the world’s most valuable consumer-goods companies, outstripping giants such as  Procter & Gamble Co. ,  Nestlé SA  and  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE .<br />It is now roughly as important to the Chinese market as  Apple Inc.  is in the U.S., accounting for 7.3% of the Shanghai Composite Index while Apple makes up about 6.7% of the S&P 500.

They join others, from the makers of Purell hand sanitizer to Peloton bikes, in assessing their businesses.<br />Widespread lockdowns and a lack of social interaction boosted U.S. toy sales 16% last year to more than $25 billion, according to research firm NPD Group Inc. Parents diverted spending on canceled vacations and summer camps to in-home diversions. Stimulus payments helped the industry too.<br />Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner said there is a good chance households that became interested in board games during the pandemic will buy more games, which is what families that already played board games did during lockdown.<br />“We brought in these new families who may have had some prior experience with gaming, but it wasn’t really top of mind,” Mr. Goldner said in an interview. “We saw dedicated families certainly bought more deeply too.”</td>

Spot prices at both hubs have been similar to those of futures.<br />Prices for propane, a byproduct of natural-gas drilling and crude-oil refining, are up more than fourfold from the bottom in March, when lockdowns sent energy prices crashing and the market hadn’t yet contemplated cold-weather outdoor dining.<br />Without much winter weather until lately, the propane market has been buoyed by overseas buyers as well as sales to stuck-at-home Americans and restaurants trying to extend patio season with portable heaters. Residential prices are up about 20% since late November, averaging $2.21 a gallon last week, according to the Energy Information Administration.</td>

This week, private-equity firms Bain Capital LLC and Cinven Group Ltd. struck a $4.7 billion deal to acquire the specialty-ingredients business of Swiss life-sciences company  Lonza Group AG . That followed Friday’s $4.7 billion agreement for a  Blackstone Group Inc.  and Global Infrastructure Partners-led group to buy the U.K.’s  Signature Aviation  PLC, the world’s largest operator of private-jet bases.<br />So far this year, private-equity firms have generated 29% of global deal activity, measured by value, up from 24% in the year-earlier period, according to Dealogic, a data provider.<br />Advent, which oversees $66 billion in assets, is seeking a buyer for Laird’s performance-materials business, which develops products to protect and improve the performance of automotive components, consumer electronics and next-generation 5G  wireless telecom  networks. Carriers in the U.S. and elsewhere are spending billions of dollars on airwave frequencies and equipment to build out 5G networks as consumers seek faster speeds to download movies and other services.<br />Laird, which traces its roots back nearly 200 years from its beginnings in Liverpool servicing the shipping industry, also owns two smaller businesses. One is focused on wireless connectivity and the other develops thermoelectric cooling systems, according to the company’s website.</td>

      <td>Heineken thinks operating margins will only recover to pre-Covid levels in 2023, while smaller rival Carlsberg is already back on track</td>
      <td>Global brewers are recovering from the pandemic at unequal speeds.<br />On Wednesday,  Heineken  said it sold 8% less beer in the three months through December compared with the same period of 2019. After better-than-expected sales over the summer, fresh lockdowns in key markets such as the U.K. set the world’s second-largest brewer back again in the fourth quarter. Heineken estimates that less than 30% of bars and restaurants in Europe are currently open.<br />Its outlook for this year is cloudy. Although nightlife venues may begin to reopen in a few months, bars won’t be selling beer at normal volumes while social-distancing measures remain in place. That will weigh on Heineken’s sales, around one-third of which typically come from eating and drinking venues outside the home. The brewer doesn’t expect operating margins to get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023.<br />Its guidance for a grinding three-year profit recovery is at odds with what is happening at smaller rival  Carlsberg .  The Danish brewer, which reported full-year numbers last week, actually managed to grow its operating margins in 2020 compared with the previous year. After seeing the impact of the virus in China, its biggest market, Carlsberg didn’t delay in taking costs out of the business. Heineken is only now beginning a major drive to reduce its overheads by around €2 billion, equivalent to $2.4 billion.<br />Anheuser-Busch InBev  doesn’t report its 2020 numbers until later this month. However, Barclays analyst Laurence Whyatt thinks the Budweiser owner will make slow progress between now and 2025. “We don’t expect them to get back to their 2019 margins within our forecasting period…. We are concerned about their pricing power,” he said.</td>

      <td>To rivals’ chagrin, Toyota says it is doing just fine with the global automotive chip shortage</td>
      <td>A sharp rebound in car sales has paradoxically threatened the auto sector’s recovery as car makers contend with severe shortages of automotive chips. Except, apparently, for Japan’s automotive colossus:  Toyota  says it’s doing just fine.<br />Strong results at Japan’s largest car makers show the car market is back on track after the doldrums of early 2020. Toyota said on Wednesday that its operating profit for the quarter ending in December grew 54% from a year earlier while sales increased 7%.  Honda  and  Nissan  likewise reported earnings growth that were ahead of analysts’ expectations.<br />Toyota saw year-over-year growth in all regions. Operating profit in North America more than doubled from a year earlier thanks to higher sales of sport-utility vehicles. That helped push the company’s overall operating margin to 12.1% last quarter, from 8.4% a year earlier.<br />The strong rebound in car sales has brought an unexpected problem, however, for most car makers: a severe chip shortage. A quick recovery after the sharp declines in auto sales early last year means chip makers are now unable to meet sudden new demand from car manufacturers. Adding to the problem, chip manufacturers are already running at capacity to produce components for other gadgets like personal computers and data centers, all of which got a boost from stay-at-home demand. The problem could last for months as it takes time for chip makers to ramp up capacity and readjust their product mix.<br />Most Western auto makers expect the problem to dampen their production. Honda and Nissan also expect the shortage to hurt sales, though they still revised up their profit forecast for the fiscal year ending in March. Honda lowered its sales volume forecast but expects cost cutting to offset the impact. Nissan expects the continuing restructuring of its business to help narrow expected losses.</td>

      <td>Chinese vaccine makers are racing to meet the needs of China and a growing list of countries, but there are signs that inoculations are going slower than planned.<br />In the Middle East and North Africa, countries that were depending on Chinese vaccines are experiencing delays as they try to inoculate their populations. The U.A.E, the first country outside China to approve a vaccine by Chinese state-owned drugmaker  Sinopharm ,  has switched to giving priority to the elderly, chronically ill and other select groups. It had been offering shots to everyone, which left residents waiting weeks for appointments.<br />At home, Chinese authorities have distributed more doses than many other countries, but several Western countries are ahead per capita—and China hasn’t started inoculating the elderly because of a lack of clinical trial data for that age group.<br />China had administered more than 40 million doses as of Feb. 9, according to the country’s health commission. That is far short of the goal that health officials set in a December conference call with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, according to people familiar with the matter: distributing 100 million doses before the start of the Lunar New Year holiday on Friday.<br />China isn’t alone. Vaccine shipments have been delayed around the world. But many developing countries are counting on China’s vaccines as among the few affordable and available options, and Beijing has made vaccine diplomacy a part of its foreign policy.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A U.S. plan to force the sale of TikTok’s American operations to a group including  Oracle Corp.  and  Walmart Inc.  has been shelved indefinitely, people familiar with the situation said, as President Biden undertakes a broad review of his predecessor’s efforts to address potential security risks from Chinese tech companies.<br />The TikTok deal—which had been driven by then-President Donald Trump—has languished since last fall in the midst of successful legal challenges to the U.S. government’s effort by TikTok’s owner, China’s ByteDance Ltd.<br />Discussions have continued between representatives of ByteDance and U.S. national security officials, the people said. Those discussions have centered on data security and ways to prevent the information TikTok collects on American users from being accessed by the Chinese government, they said.<br />But no imminent decision on how to resolve the issues surrounding TikTok is expected as the Biden administration determines its own response to the potential security risk posed by Chinese tech companies’ collection of data.<br />“We plan to develop a comprehensive approach to securing U.S. data that addresses the full range of threats we face,” National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said. “This includes the risk posed by Chinese apps and other software that operate in the U.S. In the coming months, we expect to review specific cases in light of a comprehensive understanding of the risks we face.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats will begin formally making their case Wednesday to convict former President Donald Trump, a day after the Senate voted to proceed with Mr. Trump’s second impeachment trial.<br />After an afternoon of arguments Tuesday on whether it was constitutional to try a former president, six Republican senators joined all Democrats in a 56-44 vote asserting the Senate’s authority to try Mr. Trump, who was impeached by the House last month in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. He left office Jan. 20.<br />Starting at noon, Democrats will have 16 hours to make their case, after which Mr. Trump’s defense team will have another 16 hours. Each trial day is expected to last eight hours. Both sides will also have the option to call for a debate and vote on calling witnesses, but it isn’t clear whether either side will seek to do so. Democrats last week asked Mr. Trump to testify, which the former president’s lawyers shot down.<br />Democrats are expected to offer as evidence video and audio presentations of the Jan. 6 riot, as they make their case that Mr. Trump incited his supporters to storm the Capitol. On Tuesday, House impeachment managers played a 13-minute video of Mr. Trump encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol and of the subsequent violence that resulted in five deaths, including that of a Capitol Police officer.<br />“That’s a high crime and misdemeanor,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the lead impeachment manager, said before playing the video on Tuesday. “If that’s not an impeachable offense, then there’s no such thing.”</td>

      <td>The trade dispute has forced Chinese buyers to pay steep premiums for imports amid a supply crunch</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—China’s ban on Australian coal imports is intensifying a crisis in its coal market, which is battling surging prices, supply shortages, conflicting policy goals and a cold winter.<br />Locked in a diplomatic brawl over Canberra’s call for an independent global inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, Beijing imposed an informal ban around September that forced boatloads of Australian coal to languish at sea. China’s central government made the embargo official at a mid-December meeting with major Chinese electricity producers, who are big buyers of thermal coal.<br />The ban complicated a supply crunch that the meeting was convened to solve, government and state media reports show. China was short of thermal coal and officials urged the companies to import more—from anywhere except Australia, China’s biggest supplier. To comply, buyers in China have had to pay steep premiums for imports from farther afield, on top of prices that have risen 84% since midyear.<br />“Coal buyers are on tenterhooks watching the import market,” the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association, which represents importers, said in a statement. “It’s been hard to replenish low coal inventory and shortages, while demand is unabated.”<br />From Norwegian salmon to Mongolian commodities, Beijing has in recent years increasingly used China’s buying heft to apply political pressure abroad—but the coal market is showing that the strategy can backfire. Even as Chinese buyers obeyed Beijing, Australia’s coal prices rallied as other buyers from big coal-consuming nations, including Japan and India, stepped in.</td>

The 0.5% drop was just the second decline in 28 years.<br />Bank of America Corp.’s  loans and leases dropped by 5.7%.

Brisk lending typically suggests there is enough momentum in the economy to give companies and consumers the confidence to borrow. But the current weakness suggests questions remain about the vigor of the economic recovery.<br />For banks, this weighed on profit. Net interest income, the spread between what banks charge borrowers and pay depositors, fell 5% across the industry last year—a consequence of shrinking loan portfolios and near-zero interest rates. It was the biggest drop in more than 80 years of record-keeping, according to research by Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at Wells Fargo.</td>

      <td>Top moments and themes from Tuesday’s presentations and vote on the constitutionality of the proceedings</td>
      <td>Here are five takeaways from the first day of the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump.<br />1. Democrats Draw Some GOP Support, but Face Uphill Battle<br />Tuesday’s debate and vote focused on whether a former president can be tried by the Senate in an impeachment proceeding. After an afternoon of presentations by House managers and former President Trump’s lawyers, the Senate voted 56-44 that the case was constitutional and could proceed, as six Republicans sided with Democrats on that narrow question. But the vote total was well short of the 67 that will be needed to convict the former president on the broader question of whether he incited an insurrection at the Capitol. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana was the only Republican to shift to the Democrats’ position on the question of constitutionality. He had sided with Republicans in a test vote last month over the constitutionality of trying a former president. On Tuesday, he sided with Democrats in asserting that the Senate had jurisdiction.<br />2. Debating the ‘January Exception’ to Impeachment<br />Democrats said the trial was on solid legal footing and that the Constitution didn’t include a “January exception” that would allow presidents to go unpunished for improper actions in the final weeks of their tenure. Mr. Trump’s lawyers countered that the Senate can’t try Mr. Trump because he is now a private citizen and can’t be penalized by removal from office. “Presidents are impeachable, presidents are removable,” said Trump lawyer David Schoen. “Former presidents are not because they cannot be removed.” But lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.) argued that removal from office was never “the exclusive purpose of impeachment in America.’’ Democrats plan to hold a vote to bar Mr. Trump from office if he is convicted.</td>

      <td>Lead defense lawyer ‘just rambled on and on and on,’ says one Republican lawmaker</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Republican senators criticized former President Donald Trump’s impeachment lawyers’ presentations as underwhelming and ineffective, even as all but six GOP lawmakers sided with the defense team’s position that the case was unconstitutional.<br />In an afternoon session dedicated to the question of whether the trial was constitutional, Trump lawyer Bruce L. Castor Jr. had a rough start: He introduced himself as the “lead prosecutor,” before clarifying that he was Mr. Trump’s lead counsel and assuring senators: “I do understand the difference.”<br />In about 45 minutes of remarks, Mr. Castor veered from the fall of Rome and Greece to the trade-off between liberty and security, occasionally referencing his relationships with some senators while only briefly addressing the core questions of the case.<br />In an unusual concession, he said Democrats’ leadoff arguments had been better than expected. “I’ll be quite frank with you: We changed what we were going to do on account that we thought the House managers’ presentation was well done,” Mr. Castor said.<br />Republicans offered harsh assessments of Mr. Trump’s team, while many praised the Democrats’ lead manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, as well-prepared and impassioned.</td>

      <td>The president gives another bleak assessment on the economy while his Labor Department reports an increase in job openings.</td>
      <td>The young Biden administration has already settled into an odd pattern of dissonance between the economic data the government reports and the president’s characterization of the economy. Encouraging updates from federal agencies are followed by gloomy proclamations from the Oval Office intended to justify massive federal action. Tuesday brought another bleak political message on the heels of a positive market reading.<br />In the morning the Labor Department reported that U.S. job openings ticked up in December to 6.6 million. This not only represented a slight increase from November’s historically high reading of 6.5 million but also exceeded the prior-year level during the pre-Covid salad days.<br />Recently this column noted that, in the language of the Obama-Biden administration, our new President Joe Biden has received a sizable “inheritance” from his predecessor in terms of a rebounding economy.  Measured in terms of the number of open positions for U.S. workers, the last full month of the Trump presidency is the greatest “inheritance” any U.S. president has ever passed on to his successor.<br />December’s 6.6 million job openings exceed by more than a million the number in President Barack Obama’s last full month in office. And President Biden’s “inheritance” from Donald Trump is more than twice the size of the one President George W. Bushbequeathed to Mr. Obama.<br />But you would never know it listening to Mr. Biden at the White House  today. Prior to a meeting with corporate chieftains, the president didn’t mention the good news his government had reported just hours earlier. Instead, he offered essentially the same talking points he’s been using since last spring’s shutdowns.</td>

      <td>Shares have soared recently, but heavy investments show the social-media platform has some rough edges to smooth out</td>
      <td>Social media is often about appearing to be more polished than you really are.  Twitter  is no exception.<br />From the looks of its fourth-quarter report, the company hardly seems like one that has recently been embroiled in political controversy. In that quarter, Twitter was the subject of frequent criticism from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans. And in January, it booted Mr. Trump off its platform. His account was once followed by nearly half the company’s total base of monetizable daily users, and the move enraged many of them in the process.<br />On the surface, at least, it doesn’t seem to have mattered. The company said Tuesday it boosted the number of users by 27% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter and that people continued to flock to the platform throughout January despite the political criticism from both right and left.<br />But looks can be deceiving. In its shareholder letter, Twitter managed to avoid the elephant in the room, opting to share its outlook for the remainder of 2021 without much political context. But it did say it expects to see user growth slow from 27% in the fourth quarter to low-double digits in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, indicating the 34% pace the company posted in the second quarter of 2020 was about as good as it gets.<br />Twitter’s shares are up 39% over the last three months, even before they rose another 3% after hours on Tuesday. Those are roughly the same gains as  Pinterest ,  a social-media service that reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 76% last week and projected another quarter of 70%-plus sales growth for the first quarter. Twitter’s first-quarter guidance for revenue growth of just over 22% at the midpoint looks rather dull by comparison.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The second impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump opened with graphic videos of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Some of the clips played by the House impeachment managers featured the senators themselves and the same chamber in which they now sit in judgment.<br />Almost all 100 senators, most of them masked because of Covid-19, silently watched and listened in the hushed chamber as rioters on the screens rammed doors, attacked police, and chanted: “Treason!” and “Traitors!” and “Where the f--- are they?!”<br />The trial began 27 days after the House impeached Mr. Trump, accusing him of inciting the mob that stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn his loss to President Biden in the November election.<br />As the video played Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) watched from his front-row seat near the middle of the floor. He sat motionless, his hands clasped loosely in his lap, as the video replayed his own forceful speech from that same spot, shortly before rioters broke into the building.<br />In those remarks, Mr. McConnell said there was no doubt that Mr. Biden won the presidency on Nov. 3. He warned that overturning the election would send democracy into a “death spiral.”</td>

      <td>Democrats lobby Biden to write off debt for affluent borrowers.</td>
      <td>The Biden Presidency is quickly turning into Barack Obama’s third term, only more liberal. Consider the Democrats calling on President Biden to use the pandemic to cancel $50,000 in student debt per borrower. What they want everyone to forget is that in 2010 they used the last recession to justify a federal takeover of student loans that have since more than doubled to $1.6 trillion. Now they’re using the pandemic to justify loan write-offs they said would never happen.<br />The great student loan scam began in 2010 when Democrats used budget “savings” from ending the federal guaranteed-loan program to pay for ObamaCare. “By cutting out the middleman, we’ll save American taxpayers $68 billion in the coming years,” Mr. Obama declared. Where were the media fact-checkers then?<br />An analysis for the Education Department last year estimated that $435 billion in student loans (excluding private originated loans that are federally guaranteed) will eventually be written off. One reason: Democrats in 2010 created “income-based repayment plans” that limited borrower monthly payments to 10% of discretionary income and discharged the remaining balance after 20 years.<br />These plans now comprise a third of new undergraduate and nearly 60% of graduate loans. Since many borrowers are making only de minimis payments, their balances continue to grow and accrue interest, although most will be forgiven. In other words, the feds are already set to write down a large chunk of debt.<br />But unwilling to let the pandemic go to waste, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer and House Democrats are demanding that Mr. Biden go further and cancel as much as $50,000 in debt per person. Ms. Warren says this would cost taxpayers a wee $650 billion and “boost our economy right now.”</td>

The average yield on U.S. junk bonds dropped below 4% for the first time on Monday amid a market scavenger hunt for higher returns.<br />The Federal Reserve has pushed down long-term interest rates by buying bonds and committed to keep short-term interest rates at near zero through 2023. While the central bank’s interventions were needed in March, it continued to buy corporate bonds well into the summer when markets didn’t need the support.<br />Chairman Jerome Powell last month reassured investors that the Fed won’t take away its market support until the economy makes “substantial further progress” toward inflation above 2% and maximum employment. The rush into high-yield corporate and municipal debt has since accelerated with yields dropping due to great demand.<br />Junk-rated Chicago Public Schools and the city of Detroit recently floated bonds yielding less than 2%. Spreads with the AAA muni-bond benchmark have collapsed. The sages at  BlackRock  last month recommended high-yield munis for their “diversification benefits” and “high levels of income” and saw “significant value” in Puerto Rican bonds.<br />Investors are on the prowl for high-yield corporates, and money managers are cold-calling non-investment grade companies to pitch deals. January was a record month for junk-bond sales. Companies rated in the three lowest non-investment tiers before default have set records for weekly borrowing twice this year, says  Bank of America .  Investors are even snapping up junk bonds that fund dividends and those that allow borrowers to pay interest with more debt.</td>

      <td>Even Senate Democrats wonder why he ousted an Illinois U.S. Attorney.</td>
      <td>A new President abruptly fires a prosecutor overseeing high-level political corruption cases. That’s big news, right? Well, it was in 2017 when President Trump axed Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time and a media favorite. You can tell power in Washington has changed hands because of the muted response as the Biden White House ousts U.S. Attorney John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois.<br />Joe Biden is swiftly pushing out almost all U.S. attorneys who served under his predecessor, which is increasingly the norm for new Presidents. But even Illinois Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, staunch allies of Mr. Biden, objected to his firing of Mr. Lausch, who has been a scourge of corruption in Democratic-dominated Springfield.<br />“While we agree with the Biden Administration’s criminal justice agenda, we are disappointed with the decision to terminate U.S. Attorney Lausch without consulting us,” the Senators said in a statement Tuesday. They cited the need to “conclude sensitive investigations” and added that “Mr. Lausch should be permitted to continue in his position until his successor is confirmed by the Senate.”<br />Mr. Lausch’s corruption probes have implicated a Chicago alderman and Springfield politicians. In July 2020 his office announced a $200 million settlement with the state’s primary electric utility company for its efforts to buy off “associates of a high-level elected official for the state of Illinois.”<br />That official is reported to be Michael Madigan, who until last month had been Speaker of the Illinois House for all but two years since 1983. The investigation is continuing, and there’s no reason outside of politics that Mr. Lausch shouldn’t be kept on the job until the Senate confirms a successor. Mr. Lausch’s four-year term ends in November 2021, and getting a replacement could take that long.</td>

      <td>President Biden may not have buyers’ remorse over his executive order canceling the Keystone XL oil pipeline, but many others are raising the political price for his job-killing decision. And some of the second thoughts are coming from his own coalition.<br />On Tuesday West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin wrote Mr. Biden asking him “to reconsider” his executive order. Mr. Manchin, who introduced the first Keystone XL bill in 2012, noted that “pipelines continue to be the safest mode to transport our oil and natural gas resources and they support thousands of high-paying, American union jobs.”<br />Mr. Manchin’s call echoed remarks by Richard Trumka. In a recent interview with “Axios on HBO,” the president of the AFL-CIO criticized Mr. Biden’s decision and said the Laborers’ International Union of North America was right to say it would cost 1,000 existing union jobs and 10,000 projected construction jobs.<br />The union chief was also skeptical about the “green jobs” that Mr. Biden keeps saying will replace them: “You know, when they laid off at the mines back in Pennsylvania, they told us they were going to train us to be computer programmers.” Readers may recall that John Kerry, Mr. Biden’s climate envoy, recently said workers who lose jobs in fossil fuels will be able to make solar panels. Sure, if they move to China, where most solar panels are made.<br />Meanwhile, 14 Republican state attorneys general also wrote Mr. Biden asking him to reconsider his Keystone XL diktat. The AGs said Montana will lose $58 million in tax revenue, and “five of the six impacted counties are designated high-poverty areas. So your decision to shut down the project means less money for schools, less money for public services, and the elimination of business and job opportunities in those areas where they are most needed.”</td>

The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />The Greater Fool<br />The extent to which the Reddit users discussing investments do good is proportional to their participation in the price-discovery mechanism. At its best, social media serves as a forum for retail investors to conduct and share research. Investors, acting on the profit motive, will attempt to discover discrepancies between the price and long-term value of a security. If, say, a given security’s long-term value is greater than its current market price, investors will buy, raising demand and driving the market price up toward the long-term value. Minimizing price discrepancies encourages efficient allocation of capital, and collaboration through social media allows retail investors to take advantage of research otherwise available only to large institutions.<br />At its worst, social-media driven investors actively undermine the price- discovery mechanism. GameStop and AMC feature prominently in headlines, but  BB Liquidating Inc.  best illustrates the patent absurdity of Redditor investing. A remnant of the bankrupt Blockbuster Video, the firm’s latest Form 10-K states that it has “no ongoing business operations” and “will not have any operations in the future.” Nevertheless, in a few days in late January its share price rose 3,000%, giving the company an intraday high of $44 million in market capitalization.</td>

      <td>Begin with a goal, focus on the long term, talk to the other side, and never make empty threats.</td>
      <td>To the world, George P. Shultz was one of the 20th century’s most consequential people—a giant of economics and diplomacy. The man we knew had a unique ability to translate ideas into policies. Call it “the Shultz way.”<br />It always began with a goal. He wanted to expand liberty and prosperity and knew free markets were the best way to do it. At Princeton he’d been a varsity football player, and he often used sports analogies. The “accountability factor is unavoidable in all sports,” he’d say. “The free market system is one of accountability, which will work relentlessly against bad performance and reward the good.”<br />In developing policies, the Shultz way took account of the politics surrounding an issue but never lost sight of the goal. In 1971, as director of the Office of Management and Budget, he explained his approach to policy making in a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago. “Those of you familiar with sailing know what a telltale is—a strip of cloth tied to a mast to show which way the wind is blowing,” he explained. “A captain has the choice of steering his ship by the telltale, following the prevailing winds, or to steer by the compass. In a democracy, you must keep your eye on the telltale, but you must set your course by the compass.”<br />His policy approach focused on the long term. He sought to identify challenges as they emerged and develop policies to ensure that they didn’t become problems. He loved bringing people together to hash out policy solutions. Shultz was the “great convener.” He regularly gave dinners and lunches at his house on the Stanford campus or in San Francisco. He held seminars in his conference rooms at the Hoover Institution, bringing together diverse groups of academics. He hosted Nobel Laureates like Milton Friedman and Gary Becker at an annual economists weekend in Monterey, Calif. Policy makers of both parties—including former presidents—eagerly accepted his invitations and will miss them now that he is gone.<br />These get-togethers were, in part, social. But they also had a more important purpose: to develop big policies and figure out how to turn ideas to action.</td>

We drafted a constitution and planned for new elections.<br />We Yemenis have learned the hard way the price of a collapsed democratic transition. In 2014 Houthi armed factions, backed by Iran, seized power and plunged Yemen into civil war. The Houthis have attacked civilian targets, including schools, mosques, airports and parades. They have launched drones and ballistic missiles at neighboring countries, and have coordinated with U.S.-designated terrorist groups such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah. Last week we learned they are still obstructing international efforts to salvage the FSO Safer oil tanker and avert an environmental catastrophe.<br />Unfortunately, much of Congress’s attention—notably among Democrats—has focused not on the Houthis but on the Arab countries striving to restore Yemen’s legitimate government in line with multiple U.N. resolutions.<br />We welcome President Biden’s desire to accelerate a negotiated solution, even after announcing the end of U.S. assistance for the coalition’s “offensive” operations.</td>

Since the U.S. election in November, we have something more in common: We are both “back.” President Biden tweeted as much a couple of weeks after the election: “America is back.” The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, also tweeted a “Welcome back” to America that month. A couple of weeks ago, the Toronto Star featured an article with the headline “Joe Biden’s inauguration was a message to the world: America is back.”<br />Canada has been back since October 2015, when, on his victorious election night, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, “On behalf of 35 million Canadians, we’re back.” He was re-elected in 2019, and though his parliamentary majority was reduced to a minority, he and we remain back.<br />Where were Canada and the U.S. before coming back? Away, apparently. Gone baby, gone. The U.S. and Canada suffered through modern Dark Ages, dictatorial enemy occupations from which there was no respite and in which there was no hope. That is, until citizens voting in free elections, following years of open debate and criticism, ousted President Trump and Prime Minister Stephen Harper.<br />Canada has been back for longer than the U.S., but Americans have already gotten a taste of what’s in store. First, virtue signaling: Messrs. Biden and Trudeau both made a show of selecting diverse cabinets. Mr. Biden rejoined the powerless Paris Agreement and Mr. Trudeau tried to win Canada a U.N. Security Council seat. He failed, but we’re still back. You may get to know the feeling.</td>

      <td>Their rigid opposition to charter schools and in-person learning has parents and even politicians fed up.</td>
      <td>Perhaps it doesn’t receive much attention anymore because it’s become so commonplace. The best schools in New York state are again public charter schools. Ho-hum.<br />According to the most recent data from School Digger, a website that aggregates test score results, 23 of the top 30 schools in New York in 2019 were charters. The feat is all the more impressive because those schools sported student bodies that were more than 80% black and Hispanic, and some two-thirds of the kids qualified for free or discount lunches. The Empire State’s results were reflected nationally. In a U.S. News & World Report ranking released the same year, three of the top 10 public high schools in the country were charters, as were 23 of the top 100—even though charters made up only 10% of the nation’s 24,000 public high schools.<br />We are told constantly by defenders of the education status quo that the learning gap is rooted in poverty, segregation and “systemic” racism. We’re told that blaming traditional public schools for substandard student outcomes isn’t fair given the raw material that teachers have to work with. But if a student’s economic background is so decisive, or if black students need to be seated next to whites to understand Shakespeare and geometry, how can it be that so many of the most successful public schools are dominated by low-income minorities?<br />Some will argue that charter schools obtain these results by picking the best students, which isn’t true. Of the 43 states that have charters, all but three—Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming—mandate that lotteries be used to choose students randomly. Washington Post education writer Jay Matthews reports that even states that don’t officially require the use of lotteries use them anyway or employ “other impartial ways of admitting students.”<br />A second popular argument against charter schools is that they benefit from having motivated students, which is true but misleading. Numerous empirical studies have shown that charter students outperformed similarly motivated peers in traditional public schools who applied to a charter but weren’t admitted. But there’s an even more fundamental problem with the “motivation” explanation of charter success, as Thomas Sowell explains in his most recent book, “Charter Schools and Their Enemies.”</td>

      <td>It was the ﬁrst time that a black man in the South had dared to sue a white mob for damages, and it caused a sensation.</td>
      <td>Around 12 o’clock on the cold, moonlit night of Jan. 21, 1897, a 42-year-old black farmer named George Dinning, his wife, Mollie, and seven of their children were sleeping in their cabin near Price’s Mill, Ky., when they were awakened by two dozen white men surrounding the house. Wielding pistols and shotguns, the mob accused Dinning of some recent thefts and ordered him to vacate his 125-acre farm, which he had purchased 20 years before from the family that had enslaved him.<br />When Dinning called out that he wasn’t guilty, and could prove it, the men fired into the cabin, grazing him in the head and arm. Still in his underclothes, he grabbed his shotgun, ran to an upstairs window and got off a single round of birdshot, killing 32-year-old Jodie Conn, the son of a wealthy planter. The mob fired another volley and then retreated. The next morning Dinning surrendered to the Simpson County sheriff, Bud Clark. That same day, several men returned to the farm, evicted Mollie, and torched the fields, house and outbuildings. She and the children fled to relatives in Tennessee.<br />Kentucky (birthplace of both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis) had declared neutrality in the Civil War, but racist violence was common there in the 1890s, with 10 lynchings recorded in the 13 months before the attack on George Dinning. As Ben Montgomery relates in “A Shot in the Moonlight,” his deeply felt, copiously researched chronicle of this episode and its repercussions, what made Dinning’s case extraordinary, even more than his forceful self-defense, was his unprecedented search for justice.<br />Dinning was aided by a surprising number of whites, starting with Sheriff Clark, who spirited his prisoner to distant Louisville for safekeeping. Later, when Dinning was conveyed back to Simpson County to be tried for murder, many doubted that he would live to see the verdict. But Republican Gov. William Bradley, who had recently signed an anti-lynching law, dispatched two companies of soldiers to guard the accused, along with a pair of cannon.<br />When the trial began, in June, the prosecution witnesses admitted to being in the crowd that night but claimed that they had gone with friendly intent and were leaving when Dinning fired. The defense attorney, a local man known for fairness, seized on the implausibilities and inconsistencies in their testimony. Why would Dinning shoot if the men were dispersing? When the white jury returned, they found the defendant not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, sentencing him to seven years at hard labor.</td>

The group holds a combined 6.3% stake in the Greeneville, Tenn., company, the people said.<br />Forward Air, which has a market value of around $2.3 billion, specializes in expedited less-than-truckload services, including airport-to-airport shipments of high value products such as automotive parts and electronics equipment. It also has smaller intermodal and pool-distribution segments. Like other trucking and logistics companies, its volumes dropped sharply in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, though they have since been recovering.<br />The activist group believes the company has other problems. It argues that Forward Air’s performance has lagged behind that of peers like XPO Logistics Inc. and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. because it has diversified instead of staying focused on its core expedited business, the people said. The group blames this on acquisitions and capital expenditures over the past decade or so that have hurt the company’s return on invested capital.<br />The activist’s goal is to get its four director candidates voted in at the annual meeting so they can affect changes including strengthening management and improving margins. Its candidates are Forward Air’s founder Scott Niswonger, former CFO Andrew Clarke, Ancora’s James Chadwick and leadership consultant Dawn Garibaldi, the people said.</td>

      <td>The Biden administration plans to ramp up a public safety campaign focused on social distancing and mask wearing to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the coming weeks as states begin relaxing public-health measures, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />But the administration will delay a broad national campaign it had been planning that would promote vaccine awareness until more doses are available, the person said, and will instead launch a limited version targeting smaller groups where skepticism is pervasive.<br />The decision to focus on masks and distancing and to temporarily narrow its vaccine campaign announced Jan. 21 reflects what health authorities have been saying for weeks: Mask wearing, social distancing, and testing are critical as new variants spread, because there may not be enough vaccines to inoculate most people in the U.S. until late summer. Meanwhile, states including New York, Massachusetts, Iowa, North Dakota, Minnesota, New Jersey and Washington have relaxed mask mandates or indoor-dining restrictions.<br />Scarcity of vaccine doses and complications in the rollout have led to long waits for shots in many states.<br />Vaccine skepticism remains a barrier to getting shots to populations most at risk. About one-third of Black adults say they plan to avoid the vaccine, compared with about one-fifth of Hispanic and white adults who don’t plan to get vaccinated, according to recent survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</td>
