In that role, she worked closely with then-Vice President Biden, including during daily intelligence briefings.<br />Mr. Biden’s transition team announced four other nominees on Thursday, two of them Obama administration veterans.<br />Mr. Biden will nominate former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to return to his role leading the federal agency and Denis McDonough, who served as White House chief of staff in the Obama administration, to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.<br />He will also nominate Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development and Katherine Tai, the chief trade counsel for the Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, as U.S. Trade Representative. The Wall Street Journal had previously reported Mr. Vilsack, Ms. Fudge and Ms. Tai’s new roles.</td>

The day’s fourth decision dismissed on procedural grounds a challenge to Delaware’s unique requirement for partisan balance on the state courts.<br />The no-fly case brought together two sometimes different legal threads on the Supreme Court: a conservative push to expand protections for religious expression and the liberal interest in accountability for misconduct by law enforcement.<br />Three Muslim men, a U.S. citizen and two permanent residents, alleged that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents pressured them to serve as informers on fellow Muslims. After they refused, the agents retaliated by placing them on the no-fly list, a secret roster of people U.S. authorities forbid from boarding commercial aircraft over terrorism concerns.</td>

Under the newly announced rules, it could take two or three days, he said.<br />Covid-19 has killed about 180,000 people in Brazil so far, second only to the U.S. The average daily death toll peaked at more than 1,000 people in July and had steadily been in decline, but a sharp rise over the past few weeks has raised concerns about a possible second surge in the country.</td>

Mr. Sarkozy insisted, to the surprise of his contemporaries, that religion must have some serious role in French society. His endorsement was strongly seconded by Pope Benedict XVI who both in France and the U.S. spoke of a “healthy secularism,” one in which the government, while always maintaining its autonomy, recognized the spiritual and transcendent dimension of humanity. Failing such recognition, Islam will remain a polarizing and unassimilated element within French society.<br />Rev. Prof. Thomas G.

      <td>Net new supply of new bonds could hit the lowest level since 2002 next year—a potential headache for bond fund managers</td>
      <td>The record corporate borrowing boom fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pandemic response may be coming to an end. Wall Street bankers and investors are preparing for a sharp drop in corporate bond sales next year.<br />Companies with investment-grade credit ratings will likely issue $1.1 trillion of new bonds in 2021, a 32% reduction from this year, according to research by  Barclays  PLC. Many are flush with cash after borrowing to bolster their balance sheets through the pandemic’s economic shutdowns.<br />The anticipated decline becomes even sharper after accounting for expected debt repayments, which offset new bond sales. Analysts at  Bank of America Corp.  forecast that net new corporate bond issuance will be $63 billion next year. That would be the lowest total since the bank began tracking it in 2002.<br />The Fed has eased borrowing conditions throughout the pandemic by dropping interest rates near zero, saying it expects to keep them there for years, and by implementing other measures, such as buying corporate bonds for the first time. The efforts have helped keep the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below 1% for months. It settled Thursday at 0.907%, according to Tradeweb.<br />A steep decline in bond borrowing would be a sign that corporate chieftains feel less need to buffer balance sheets and that they will be spending some of the $2.1 trillion amassed earlier this year. For portfolio managers, it would be a mixed blessing: A declining supply of new bonds would drive up prices of those investors already own, but make it tougher to find new securities to buy with the cash that continues to pour into bond funds.</td>

Donald Trump and Senate Republicans increased the debt by $6.7 trillion over the last four years. To put that in perspective, the Obama administration increased the debt by $8.6 trillion over eight years. In real dollar terms, the last four years saw the greatest spending increase in U.S. history. In other words, apart from perhaps Rand Paul, the redistributionists on the right long ago lost the ability to cry foul over spending.<br />Matt Elbert<br />Houston</td>

The idea, it says, is to equip people with the education needed to work in cloud-computing at a number of employers seeking to fill high-tech positions. While some participants might find jobs at Amazon, it is more likely they would get hired at other companies, including many that use Amazon Web Services, the online retailer’s cloud division.<br />The free training could support those looking to prepare for entry-level support positions or in helping existing engineers broaden their expertise in areas like machine learning or cybersecurity, the company says.<br />Teresa Carlson, a vice president at Amazon Web Services, says the company hears almost daily from its clients that they can’t find the right people to fill technical jobs as many organizations move their applications and processes to the cloud.</td>

A decision about whether to hear the case likely will follow as soon as Thursday afternoon or Friday.<br />In the filing, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accuses the four states of “rampant lawlessness,” claiming they violated their own election laws when officials adjusted voting procedures to process mail-in ballots, which millions of voters employed to comply with public-health guidance to reduce transmission of Covid-19. Texas contends that in making such accommodations, the states violated federal constitutional provisions that direct state legislatures to determine the “manner” of appointing electors.<br />Mr. Trump called the lawsuit “the big one” in a tweet Wednesday. “The Supreme Court has a chance to save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States,” the president tweeted Thursday.</td>

      <td>BRUSSELS—British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a strong possibility that negotiations over a new trade agreement with the European Union would fail as the European Commission set out contingency plans to maintain basic rail, air and freight links between the U.K. and the bloc in case talks collapse.<br />Both sides are preparing for significant border disruption on Jan. 1 affecting trade worth close to $900 billion a year, along with personal and business travel, as the U.K.’s current commercial and security ties with the bloc fall away on Jan. 1.<br />New obstacles at the frontier would be lessened—though not disappear—if a deal over their future relationship can be agreed. Mr. Johnson’s public pessimism and the EU contingency plans laid out Thursday reflect a mutual assessment that an accord might not be reached in time.<br />In a video clip issued by his office Thursday, Mr. Johnson indicated there was a good chance the negotiations would fail. “We need to be very, very clear there is now a strong possibility—a strong possibility—that we will have a solution that’s more like an Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU,” Mr. Johnson said.<br />An Australian relationship is the term the British government has increasingly used to describe the two sides trading with no trade agreement but under terms laid out by the World Trade Organization. That would impose customs duties on goods such as food, clothing and cars that have traded tariff-free between the U.K. and the EU since 1973.</td>

Nearly all the equipment he needed fit neatly into a couple of rolling cases. “It’s a reminder that you don’t need all that stuff,” he said. “If you have a story and you have good actors, with the technology now you can make something that looks amazing for nothing.”<br />Here, the director talks film homework and the price of making movies.<br />What I look for as a filmmaker is: freedom and momentum. Shooting on an iPhone gave me that. I wanted the ability to put a lens anywhere in seconds.

Eric Swalwell to be removed from office over allegations that the lawmaker was targeted by a suspected Chinese spy, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to rise to the defense of her fellow California Democrat.<br />Mr. Swalwell was named in a report by Axios earlier this week that said a Chinese intelligence operative developed ties with local and national California politicians, in what U.S. officials believe was a political intelligence operation.<br />The operative, known as Fang Fang or Christine Fang, fundraised for Mr. Swalwell’s 2014 re-election campaign and helped put an intern in his office, according to the report. It said Mr. Swalwell hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, or of sharing any classified information. Mr. Swalwell said on CNN that he was told about Ms. Fang and offered to help with the investigation.<br />“All I did was cooperate and the FBI said that yesterday,” Mr. Swalwell said Wednesday. He didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Wall Street Journal.<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment on details of the case involving Ms. Fang, but an official confirmed that the FBI had briefed Mr. Swalwell on the issue. “Congressman Swalwell was completely cooperative and he was under no suspicion of wrongdoing,” the official said.</td>

      <td>Brent crude prices topped $50 a barrel for the first time since early March on Thursday, the latest milestone in a remarkable oil-market recovery fueled by supply curtailments and drivers returning to the road.<br />The global gauge of oil prices advanced 2.8% to $50.25 a barrel, continuing a monthslong rebound from its April lows around $19 during global economic shutdowns. While Brent started the year above $65, its recent rally shows how hopes for coronavirus-vaccine distribution and economic-stimulus programs are helping to heal global energy markets.<br />Oil has risen in tandem with stocks and other commodities in recent weeks, part of a broad market rally fueled by investors’ anticipation for a 2021 global economic resurgence. Buoyant demand from China also is boosting oil prices after the world’s largest commodity consumer largely contained the pandemic.<br />Traders are now hoping that travel picks up in the U.S. and Europe next year, boosting energy consumption while large suppliers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries remain disciplined with production cuts.<br />OPEC and allies including Russia agreed to modest output increases last week, instilling faith that the group won’t bring back supply too quickly and adding momentum to the oil-price rally. Recent gains come despite a recent surge in coronavirus cases around the world and data showing a drop-off in U.S. fuel demand, showing how investors are looking past those concerns and instead focusing on vaccine hopes.</td>

      <td>George Clooney directs and stars in this post-apocalypic saga that intertwines the stories of an Arctic researcher, returning astronauts, and a mysterious little girl.</td>
      <td>Toward the end of “The Midnight Sky”—a haunting post-apocalyptic adventure starring George Clooney, who directed, and Felicity Jones—astronauts aboard a space ship that’s been forced to change course discuss using the slingshot effect, getting a boost in velocity from the gravitational field of a planet, in this case Earth. The film, showing in select theaters before its debut on Netflix later this month, gets a boost from the gravity of Earth’s plight. In the past it was easier to see end-of-civilization sagas as entertainment. Now, at a time when the United Nations secretary-general has called the state of our planet “broken,” a movie like this one hits closer to home. That’s not to suggest it is nothing more than a cautionary tale. Mr. Clooney and his colleagues have crafted an elegant screen version of a novel by Lily Brooks-Dalton with a resonant performance at its center—his own.<br />He plays Augustine, an aging scientist and the last person left at an Arctic observatory after a catastrophe, described only as “a mistake,” has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. Grievously ill and dependent on blood transfusions that he manages himself, he turns down an offer of evacuation in order to face his solitary fate. But Augustine’s isolation doesn’t last. He’s jolted by a status-board notification of the astronauts’ impending return from deep space; they’ve been away for two years, exploring a planet for possible colonization, and have no idea what has happened at home. Then he’s startled by the sudden appearance, right there in the observatory kitchen, of a little girl in a yellow dress and sneakers. (She’s played delightfully by Caoillin Springall, who was only 6 years old at the time of production.) Who is she? Was she left behind by evacuees? Impossible to know, because she doesn’t speak, and no way to ask, since all communications are down.<br />Solitude—existential and seemingly implacable—provides the film’s theme; the urgent human need to break out of it provides the action. The astronauts, including Ms. Jones’s Sully and David Oyelowo’s Adewole, the mission commander, don’t understand why they can’t reach mission control or anyone else on Earth. Augustine can’t tell them what happened, let alone warn them off. When a radio link is finally established it quickly fails, prompting the scientist to embark—yes, with the little girl bundled up in a parka—on a perilous trek to another Arctic station with a stronger transmitter.<br />That’s the most suspenseful part of the film, but also the most conventional, a sort of “Revenant Redux.” (No accident, since the screenplay was written by Mark L. Smith, who adapted “The Revenant” with its director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu; Mr. Smith’s adaptation here is, in the main, astute and admirably spare.) The most affecting part is Augustine’s reaching out to the space ship, with its precious human cargo. He’s had one quasi-fatherhood thrust upon him by the mysterious child, who draws a flower to tell him that her name is Iris; another father-daughter relationship is implicit in his desperate concern for Sully, whose fate becomes intertwined with his own.<br />Seeing Mr. Clooney in the role is a shock. Gone is the jauntily handsome figure we’re accustomed to. Augustine is weary, frightened, regretful of a loveless past evoked in flashback, and just plain old, with a beard so luxuriant it looks animated. He is also, now and then, warm and funny. It won’t give away too much to tell you that Augustine and Iris can’t connect fully until, sharing a wordless dinner that includes potatoes and green peas, they line up their peas on the table, then flick them at each other like kids shooting marbles.</td>

      <td>In Will Arbery’s singular, sympathetic play, young conservative intellectuals gather to discuss their post-graduate lives and political concerns in the age of Trump.</td>
      <td>Will Arbery’s “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” was one of the most talked-about plays of 2019, and I fully intended to review Playwrights Horizons’ New York premiere in this space. Unfortunately, a family crisis made it impossible for me to do so, and the coming of the pandemic subsequently prevented regional theaters from taking up the play. I’ve been crossing my fingers ever since that somebody out there would mount a webcast version. Now Philadelphia’s Wilma Theater, one of the East Coast’s leading drama companies, has taped a fully staged site-specific production of “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” at a private location in the Poconos, turning the cast and crew into a closed quarantine “bubble” so that they could work together face-to-face instead of taping their performances separately via Zoom or green screens. The result, which looks more like a small-scale movie than an online webcast of a stage show, is a flawless, impressively well-cast production of a work of singular distinction, one for which the word “remarkable” is, if anything, an understatement.<br />The play, directed by Blanka Zizka, is set in rural Wyoming in 2017. It centers on Emily (Campbell O’Hare), Kevin (Justin Jain) and Teresa (Sarah Gliko), who are in their mid-to-late 20s and are meeting at the off-the-grid shack of Justin (Jered McLenigan), a somewhat older but like-minded man. The young people are all in the familiar process of discovering themselves, but there is nothing else ordinary about them: They are conservative Catholic intellectuals-in-the-making who have been girding themselves for battle in the coming culture wars.<br />Kevin and Teresa went to the same school, Transfiguration College, and have come to Justin’s house to meet with Gina (Mary Elizabeth Scallen), Emily’s mother and Transfiguration’s incoming president, and tell her about their post-graduate lives in the age of Trump. Like them, Transfiguration is very unusual, a school where, as Teresa says, “you got wilderness training, where you spoke conversational Latin and locked your phone in a safe for four years.” Not surprisingly, it produces alumni who make casual mention in bull sessions of Martin Heidegger and “my gal Flannery O” (that’s O’Connor to you), ask each other questions like “How’s your soul? Is it in peril?” and believe it to be the destiny of those unwilling to do battle with the rise of postmodern secularism to degenerate into “a throbbing mass of genderless narcissists….Everyone working for any business or public school will be frog-marched through diversity and inclusion training. It won’t just be about tolerating, which we do, it will be about affirming their disorder. Which is a sin.” Notwithstanding their avowed religious conservatism, though, the characters have mostly come to view Donald Trump with skepticism, even though they all supported him in 2016, albeit unenthusiastically (“After I voted for Trump I vomited next to my car”).<br />Part of what makes Mr. Arbery’s play so good is that its characters are portrayed on their own terms. No one shows up at evening’s end to make these-people-are-100%-evil noises meant to calm the horrified audience. (I would love to know what Tony Kushner, a wholly different kind of playwright but one from whom Mr. Arbery appears to have learned valuable lessons, made of it.) While I feel sure that many of those who saw “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” in New York found the characters, not entirely without reason, to be potentially dangerous extremists, they are far more complicated and interesting than that, for life in urban America has nibbled away at their orthodoxies, and none of them now takes the carved-in-stone truths of Transfiguration College at face value. Not at all surprisingly, Mr. Arbery grew up in the kind of cultural environment he describes here, which makes it possible for him to portray it with the deep comprehension and distanced sympathy that give “Heroes” its dramatic power.<br />“Heroes” is a conversation piece that runs for 2 1/2 hours, and those with no appetite for intellectual talk will doubtless find it far too long. But it is a real play, not a pretentious gabfest, and Mr. Arbery is a greatly talented writer who has given us a drama as exciting and challenging—nay, daring—as any new play I’ve ever reviewed. I intend to see “Heroes” onstage as soon as the pandemic ends and it starts to be produced by regional theaters. Don’t wait for that, though: This is a play you must see, right now.</td>

Household debt rose 5.6% to $16.4 trillion, its fastest pace in at least two years.<br />Stock-market gains have driven much of the increase in net worth. The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 8.5% and 7.6%, respectively, in the July-September period, building on even bigger advances in the second quarter.<br />Many economists have described a K-shaped recovery from the coronavirus-induced shock early this year. More affluent Americans are doing well, while millions of others—including lower-paid workers in vulnerable jobs in retailing and restaurants—are seeing their incomes and net worth decline.<br />“We’ve seen home prices rise, market prices for tradable instruments rise and savings increase because people haven’t been able to spend money on everything from sporting events to weddings,” said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG LLP. “But those gains skew to upper income people.”</td>

A person familiar with Mr. Tarbert’s plans said he would retain his seat until he decides on his next move. His term expires in 2024.<br />That means Republicans will keep their 3-2 majority at the CFTC, possibly until 2022.<br />Republican commissioner Brian Quintenz hasn’t said when he plans to depart and is legally allowed to remain in the role until Jan. 3, 2022, according to a CFTC official.<br />Mr. Biden will likely appoint one of the commission’s two sitting Democrats—Dan Berkovitz or Rostin Behnam—as acting chairman while the Senate mulls an eventual nominee. But a Democratic chairman’s ability to pass tougher rules on banks, clearinghouses or derivatives traders would be held in check by the need to get at least one Republican vote.</td>

      <td>Steven Soderbergh’s microbudget, improvised comedy about old friends reuniting on a trans-Atlantic cruise stars Meryl Streep, Candice Bergen and Dianne Wiest.</td>
      <td>Making a studio feature can be arduous— relentless pressure, constant script revisions, the deployment of vast technical resources, the tyranny of marketing strategies. Any actor who values artistic freedom would jump at the chance to make a movie almost spontaneously, which is the way the HBO Max comedy “Let Them All Talk” was made, and to make it with Steven Soderbergh, a filmmaker with a special affinity for directing actors. And look who did jump: Meryl Streep, Candice Bergen and Dianne Wiest, three legends of our time. Mr. Soderbergh, serving as his own cinematographer, shot the film in two weeks on a microbudget; the main location was the luxury liner Queen Mary 2 during a trans-Atlantic crossing So how did such an adventurous production turn out? Not very well, though it’s certainly a curiosity, a chance to see what happens when superb performers improvise their lines in the absence of a conventional script.<br />Ms. Streep is Alice Hughes, a celebrated, and famously secretive, novelist who has just received a prestigious literary prize. But she’s in New York, the award ceremony will be in England, and she doesn’t fly. The problem is on its way to being solved when one of her agents, Karen (Gemma Chan), suggests that the Cunard Line might offer complimentary passage to Alice, and perhaps to several companions of her choice. (Unlikely? Hey, it’s a movie.) Seeing an occasion for some serious freeloading, Alice invites her nephew, Tyler (Lucas Hedges), and two college friends she hasn’t seen for at least 30 years—Ms. Wiest’s Susan, who advocates for incarcerated women, and Ms. Bergen’s Roberta, who sells brassieres in a department store. Thus is the stage set for a reunion, presumably fond, and for the trio to take stock of how far they’ve come in their mortal journeys and where they still hope to go.<br />How you feel about the film depends on how much sense you want it to make. What’s there for ready enjoyment is the spectacle of three women, no longer young, dishing about their lives and loves. There’s also a subplot involving Tyler and Karen, who has booked her own passage to spy on Alice and find out more about the novel she’s currently writing. (Fuzzy or improbable? Hey, it’s still a movie.) And at the center of it all is Ms. Streep’s literary lioness, at once witty, petty, vain, vulnerable, mercurial, manipulative and wise.<br />Those adjectives, though, are listed in no particular order of importance because it’s impossible to know who Alice really is in her heart of hearts, despite Ms. Streep’s beguiling efforts to sketch her in. And sketchiness is the film’s dominant quality because of how the story evolved. The writer and actress Deborah Eisenberg provided an outline, rather than a formal script, and discussed scenes with the actors during production as they improvised their dialogue.<br />Mr. Soderbergh, who directed one of my favorite films, “Out of Sight” (from Scott Frank’s brilliant screen adaptation of a terrific Elmore Leonard novel, I should add), has made a number of features, with varying success, that were partly or wholly improvised. This one, though, feels flat and slack, with scenes that drift off oddly, or aren’t there at all.</td>

      <td>Conflicts over political power and indigenous rights lie at the center of Sundance Now’s new drama.</td>
      <td>The physical and social backgrounds essential to this dark political tale exert their powers early. “Total Control” (begins Thursday, Dec. 17, Sundance Now) is a six-part drama set in the Australian Outback. A place, we’re shown, where people spend their days swatting at the flies circling their heads, and where conversation is dry and to the point, and jokey, though without cruelty. It’s the way of this society to be wary of strangers but not impossibly so, as one government representative discovers in episode 1, when he comes knocking on the door of a house in the small town of Winton. He’s met with suspicion by the woman who opens it—she quickly decides he’s a Mormon, seeking converts, and informs him that he’s wasting his time.<br />Still he’s invited in. The visitor explains that he’s looking for the woman’s daughter, who isn’t home yet, he’s informed. And so the two wait for her together. The visitor, who’s been supplied with tea and cookies, looks approvingly at the array of pictures on the wall, among them that of the queen.<br />“Ninety-three years old and never missed a day of work—now you show me someone else who will give that kind of service,” the lady of the house declares. Her visitor beams—he’s a massive fan of the queen, he informs her. The walls of this modest home are filled with mementos, testaments to experience, to memories, to a life lived. This scene—which comes less than five minutes after the horrifying dramatics of the show’s opening segment—is the first indicator that this series has something more on its mind than heroics and high principles. Something, for example, like recognizably human characters: for right here is a woman who clearly belongs in exactly such a category.<br />The lady of this house is Jan Irving (a memorable performance by Trisha Morton-Thomas), a member of Australia’s indigenous community, whose daughter is Alexandra Irving (Deborah Mailman), one of the two female characters at the heart of this tale. A place, it’s soon clear, that threatens to grow ever more crowded as the show’s various plot lines weave their way through the action, the most important of which concern Prime Minister Rachel Anderson (an elegant and persuasive Rachel Griffiths) and Alexandra. Another character shows up only briefly, but in the most haunting way—a young woman, alone, making her way in the dark through that vast lonely territory with just a knapsack. Where is she going, this young native woman who appears and disappears? She’s clearly an escapee from detention, a girl who carries with her the filmed evidence of guards administering a lethal punishment to her friend, another Aboriginal girl.<br />But the series amounts to far more than a catalog of injustices. (It was written by Stuart Page, Darren Dale, Ms. Griffiths and Miranda Dear. Director, Rachel Perkins.) It’s an enterprise mightily enlarged by its merciless focus on political combat, its depiction of longtime trusted alliances—they can die overnight, given the right impetus—its biting vision of the prevailing codes, and what passes for right and wrong in political society.</td>

      <td>Victor Kossakovsky’s documentary takes a sow as its subject to tell the story of agriculture and industrial farming.</td>
      <td>The star of Victor Kossakovsky’s “Gunda” is a pig. Gunda is her name, and lactating is her game; she’s a mammary mountain with what I counted to be 10 piglets on her slope. I had time to count piglets, and reflect on their lives and fate, because time flows slowly in this one-of-a-kind documentary feature, shot in luminous, almost magical-realist, black and white. It would flow at a turtle’s pace if the cast included turtles, but there’s only Gunda and her brood, plus a one-legged chicken who hops around a field with surprising grace and a small herd of cows, seemingly happy—or at least not unhappy—to be standing or sitting in the rain. These creatures are in no rush either. Watching them, you get some sense of their life rhythms while readjusting your own.<br />Last year I wrote about the vivid, almost hallucinatory images in Mr. Kossakovsky’s “Aquarela,” a documentary about water in all its power and various forms. Now he has turned his camera on the residents of a pigsty and the farm that surrounds it. (Actually filming took place on several farms and sanctuaries in Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom.) The filmmaker has a great gift for helping us to see, assuming that we’re willing to stick with a 93-minute film with no plot and no dialogue, only the presence of animals we’re accustomed to seeing as cute characters in commercial entertainments. (Think “Babe,” which I loved, or countless docs about pandas and penguins.)<br />The invisible element in “Gunda” is time, the unstated subject is the life these animals live—as individuals, not just animate objects—and the industrial processes that kill them. Mr. Kossakovsky’s film is ultimately political, a quiet polemic, even though the killing takes place offscreen; all we see is what Gunda sees, that one moment her piglets are there and the next moment they are gone. Pigs are smart. She’s surely aware that something terrible has happened. An improbably beautiful work of barnyard art, “Gunda” figures that we’re smart too.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the need for liability protections that Republicans have sought in negotiations over the next coronavirus relief package, as the hunt for a compromise continued in the Capitol.<br />A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate had wrapped up an agreement on much of a $908 billion package of emergency coronavirus relief on Thursday, but were still haggling over the biggest sticking point: how to structure legal protections for businesses, schools and other entities operating during the pandemic.<br />Lawmakers led by Sen. Angus King (I., Maine) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) were working on hammering out a deal on some form of limited protections, but it wasn’t clear how much GOP support their idea would draw, aides said.<br />For weeks, lawmakers have operated under the principle that any relief package would need to include some form of liability protections, long a top priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), as well as additional funding for state and local governments, a key condition of Democrats.<br />That pairing came into question this week. First, Mr. McConnell suggested dropping both measures from this package. Democrats rejected that tradeoff, arguing that liability protection wasn’t as urgent as aid to states and localities whose revenues have been hammered by the pandemic.</td>

      <td>The U.S. budget deficit widened 25% in October and November from the same period last year to $429 billion, a record for the first two months of the fiscal year, the Treasury Department said Thursday.<br />Higher spending and shrinking revenue tied to the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic downturn pushed the deficit higher. Federal spending rose 9% to $887 billion during October and November from the same period a year earlier, while revenue declined 3% to $457 billion.<br />The Treasury said the deficit would have been even wider if not for calendar quirks that moved up the timing of certain benefit payments. If not for those timing issues, the deficit in October and November would have risen 47% from the same period a year earlier.<br />Higher spending to combat the coronavirus was driven largely by increases on safety-net programs. Spending by the Agriculture Department, which administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, rose 36%, while spending on Medicaid increased 16%. Labor Department spending on jobless benefits rose to $45.1 billion in October and November, compared with $3.7 billion during the same period a year earlier.<br />Federal tax revenue declined largely as a result of lower individual income tax withholding, which senior Treasury officials attributed to high levels of unemployment tied to the pandemic, and deferred payroll taxes the government authorized through the end of this calendar year. Individual withholding was down 4% in the first two months of the fiscal year, which started on Oct. 1.</td>

      <td>The pop star’s ninth studio album, due at midnight Friday, is her second surprise release of 2020</td>
      <td>For Taylor Swift fans, Christmas is coming early: Ms. Swift on Thursday announced her ninth studio album, “Evermore,” which is the second unexpected release of the year for one of music’s most notoriously meticulous pop stars.<br />Released just five months after her intimate Grammy-nominated blockbuster “Folklore,” the new album, which Ms. Swift describes as “folklore’s sister record,” features many of the same collaborators, including The National’s Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff and Bon Iver. That continuity suggests a collection of “Folklore” leftovers and more songs written in a similarly hushed and folksy indie-rock vein.<br />“I’ve never done this before,” Ms. Swift said on social media. “In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore.”<br />“I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales,” she continued. “So I just kept writing them.”<br />The quick arrival of “Evermore” reflects a reality of today’s streaming-music economy: More is more. Like fellow pop star Ariana Grande, Ms. Swift has pivoted from carefully plotted-out releases to more spontaneous and less precious ones—borrowing from the playbook of hip-hop & R&B stars.</td>

A tax investigation focused on the Biden family’s highly questionable sources of income may finally force them to answer precisely how such income is generated in the first place.<br />The Journal’s Ken Thomas and Sabrina Siddiqui report:<br />Exactly one year ago, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and six Democrats chairing House committees unveiled their plan to charge President Donald Trump with impeachment articles which did  not claim he had committed any crimes. Mr. Trump’s alleged offense was suggesting that a foreign government look into Hunter Biden dealings which any reasonable person would say deserved examination. A source now tells the Journal that the feds began investigating Biden taxes in 2018.

Perhaps there’s a difference of opinion within the family about whether Tuesday is a plausible moment for the subject of a two-year-old investigation to learn about it.</td>

But it signifies further momentum for bitcoin, which has surged this fall. The price of a single bitcoin peaked in late November at $19,835, topping its 2017 high, and currently trades around $18,000, up 150% year-to-date.<br />MassMutual purchased the bitcoin through a New York-based fund management company called NYDIG, which has about $2.3 billion of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under management. MassMutual also acquired a $5 million minority equity stake in NYDIG, which was formerly known as New York Digital Investment Group.<br />The insurance company, founded in 1851, said the bitcoin investment was based on a broad strategy to take advantage of new opportunities while remaining diversified, “giving us measured yet meaningful exposure to a growing economic aspect of our increasingly digital world.”<br />Bitcoin, launched in January 2009, is a software program that operates across a network of linked but independent computers. It allows any two people to exchange value directly without the use of a middleman like a bank.</td>

      <td>Regulator says it isn’t necessary to extend precautionary action taken as the pandemic began</td>
      <td>U.K. banks can resume paying dividends next year after regulators ended a ban introduced in March to make lenders conserve capital during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The share prices of Britain’s biggest banks have been battered this year as they set aside billions of pounds in provisions for bad loans and curbed payouts to shareholders. Industry leaders including  Barclays  PLC Chief Executive Jes Staley and Santander Chairman Ana Botín in recent months urged regulators to allow them to start paying dividends again.<br />“An extension of the exceptional and precautionary action taken in March is not necessary,” the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority, or PRA, said in a written statement Thursday. “Any distributions should be prudent, reflecting the still elevated levels of economic uncertainty.”<br />Canceling dividends helped banks to shore up their balance sheets. The capital ratios of the U.K.’s biggest banks improved in the first half of 2020 even though they were hit with £18 billion, equivalent to $24 billion, of impairment losses, the Bank of England has said. The European Central Bank also asked banks to stop paying dividends earlier this year.<br />The dividend cancellations displeased many shareholders—particularly Hong Kong-based investors in  HSBC .  The London-based bank, which makes most of its profit in Asia, said in August that it faced lawsuits in connection with dividend cancellations.</td>

      <td>For five decades, under two very different regimes, Tehran has built up the infrastructure for a bomb but stopped short of making one</td>
      <td>Iran’s nuclear ambitions are again looming over a new American administration. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to resuscitate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that President Trump unilaterally discarded. But after four years of enduring sanctions and targeted assassinations, the Islamic Republic may no longer be listening. Some experts fear that Iran’s pragmatists—led by President Hassan Rouhani, who negotiated the nuclear agreement—have been discredited and that Iran’s hard-liners are too suspicious of the West to reengage with another American leader.<br />As usual, the debate in Washington misreads the realities in Tehran. For the past five decades, under two very different regimes, Iran has pursued essentially the same nuclear strategy. While many Westerners fret over the tussling between Iran’s moderates and hard-liners, the most striking aspect of Iran’s nuclear-arms policy over the decades is its consistency. Mr. Biden is trying to return to diplomacy at the precise time when significant arms-control breakthroughs are all but impossible.<br />Iran’s nuclear program ramped up in earnest during the 1970s, when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi concluded that his ambitions to dominate the region might require the ultimate weapon. In 1975, the shah told the  New York Times  that while he wasn’t seeking the bomb, “if 20 or 30 ridiculous little countries are going to develop nuclear weapons, then I may have to revise my policies.” In his chatty way, the shah was hinting at a nuclear hedging strategy: Iran would build a sophisticated nuclear infrastructure but defer assembling a bomb, depending on events in its dangerous neighborhood.<br />In 1979, Islamist revolutionaries overthrew the shah. The new theocracy destroyed much of the old order but proved protective of its nuclear inheritance. The Middle East was still a disorderly region, and the revolutionaries were as much Persian chauvinists as the monarch they overthrew.<br />Iran’s new clerical oligarchs never made nuclear ambitions a matter of factional dispute. The reformist President Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005) was as committed to the nuclear program as his reactionary successor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-13). Under the watchful eye of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the nuclear program didn’t fall prey to Iran’s poisonous domestic politics.</td>

On Thursday, Team USA signaled that it believes such a punishment shouldn’t happen again.<br />The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, backing the recommendations of a council on racial and social justice it helped form earlier this year, called for an end to the International Olympic Committee rule that prohibits protest at Olympic sites and venues.<br />“The USOPC values the voices of Team USA athletes and believes that their right to advocate for racial and social justice, and be a positive force for change, absolutely aligns with the fundamental values of equality that define Team USA and the Olympic and Paralympic movements,” USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland said. Team USA won’t sanction athletes for protesting at the Games in support of those causes, it said.<br />The announcement sets up a showdown ahead of next summer’s Tokyo Games between the world’s most powerful Olympic nation and the IOC, which has resisted relaxing protest rules on the biggest Olympic stages.<br />The IOC responded to a request for comment by sharing a statement from Kirsty Coventry, chair of the IOC Athletes’ Commission. She said the commission would consider the U.S. feedback and that of other nations’ athletes before providing recommendations to the IOC Executive Board. So far, the majority of athletes have said they want to preserve the Olympic podium and field of play, Coventry said.</td>

Kovrig and Spavor, who were later indicted on espionage charges, had stood trial. The reports cited a statement from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, who said in a regular briefing that Chinese authorities had “carried out the arrest, indictment and trial” of the two Canadians, according to the Chinese transcript of the briefing posted on the ministry’s website.<br />The English transcript of the briefing, posted some time after the Chinese on Thursday, says the two Canadians “were arrested, prosecuted and will be tried.”<br />According to a spokeswoman from Canada’s Foreign Department, there has been “no development” in the two Canadians’ cases. The spokeswoman said that Canadian officials in Beijing spoke directly with the Chinese Foreign Ministry and said the confusion was the result of an “inaccurate characterization” of the process.</td>

      <td>THERE’S NEVER been a better time to buy seafood online. With the crushing impact of the pandemic on the hospitality industry, seafood purveyors that once counted on wholesale business to restaurants and hotels have pivoted to direct-to-consumer online retail.<br />“It’s been survival mode,” said Peter Jarvis, president, CEO and chief fishmonger of Peter’s Florida Seafood. His company relied primarily on wholesale for 30 years, up until March of this year. Wholesale business in 2020 is still down by about 75% from what it was by this time last year, but online-retail sales of Florida stone crab claws and other fish caught in the state’s coastal waters have kept Mr. Jarvis in business and customers happy. “People are excited to get chef-quality seafood on a consistent basis, and it means a lot because they aren’t going out,” Mr. Jarvis said.<br />At Island Creek Oysters in Massachusetts, president Chris Sherman said, “We lost 98% of our core revenue overnight, which was selling oysters directly to top chefs around the country.” While Island Creek has run an online-retail operation as well for the last decade, “there were some years when it didn’t make sense to keep it going.” Beginning in March, that changed: “Within weeks of the shutdown, that [retail] part of the business really sprang to life.”<br />The companies below provide access to pristine seafood you would otherwise have to visit a restaurant to get. They’re transparent about their sourcing and vigilant about maintaining sustainable fisheries—though the profusion of packaging required to keep seafood cold and fresh in transit can be daunting to eco-conscious consumers. Whether stocking up for a holiday celebration or with an eye to healthier, omega-3-packed eating in the new year, cast your line here.<br />This outfit offers monthly subscription plans with choices of salmon, white fish (such as halibut and cod), or a combination. All seafood is wild-caught sustainably in Alaska, flash frozen and packed in coolers with dry ice. Active members have access to special offerings including Dungeness and snow crab, which come broken down and pre-cooked for easy prep; Alaska’s cold waters make for highly flavorful and subtly sweeter meat. And the sablefish is exceptionally buttery. Monthly plans are easy to set-up thanks to a straightforward website and start at $132 for a 12-pack of 6-ounce portions. wildalaskancompany.com</td>

      <td>Investors shrugging off government’s lawsuits might be missing the bigger picture</td>
      <td>Don’t scroll past  Facebook ’s  latest bit of melodrama.<br />On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission and 46 states sued the social-media company over anticompetitive practices, seeking to force the world’s largest social network to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook arguably has been in lawmakers’ sights since the contentious 2016 presidential election, and the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 certainly didn’t help matters. After years of threats, investors seemed to view the main event as almost anticlimactic, skeptical that such lawsuits will amount to any material change in the near term. Shares of Facebook were down less than 2%, on pace with a selloff affecting big tech peers on Wednesday, with an even more muted drop on Thursday.<br />While all large tech companies face pressure from regulators, Facebook seems to be the easiest target given its structure as three distinct apps. But investors’ doubts about the feasibility of a breakup certainly have merit. Both of Facebook’s acquisitions, for instance, were approved by the FTC itself, and proving that competitors and consumers were harmed, as the suits say, won’t be easy. If anything, the cases will likely take years to resolve.<br />But that doesn’t mean Facebook will skate by in the meantime. The company, which has made its fortune by spending big money to make big money, needs to prove out a fresh strategy to keep growing.<br />Facebook’s advertising business, which still accounted for nearly 99% of its overall revenue in the third quarter, appears to be reaching a saturation point. Ads served on its platform have been increasing by a quarterly average of almost 30% year on year for at least the last five years. Filling its acquired Instagram with them has contributed to that growth, first on the main feed and more recently in the app’s Stories feature. In some cases, users are seeing more ads than the new content they came to the app for. With other social platforms such as Tik Tok, Snapchat and  Pinterest  gaining traction, Facebook already walks a fine line between engaging its users and annoying them.</td>

      <td>There’s no substitute for finding candidates who capture voters’ hearts. No, not even a 30-point plan.</td>
      <td>It is tempting to treat elections as math problems, while ignoring the art required to assemble winning coalitions. Pollsters sort data along demographic groupings, data analysts dissect precinct-level trends, and ad makers consult focus groups to craft appealing messages. The result is policies designed to appeal to enough voters to win, presented by disciplined politicians in sound bites that are repeated relentlessly.<br />To win a primary, policies must appeal to chronic voters with strong single-issue preferences without turning off enough swing voters to lose the general election. Conservatives have to appeal to gun owners and evangelicals to win the primary, but take care not to alienate socially moderate suburban voters in the process. Liberals have to appeal to teacher unions, global-warming activists, pro-choice feminists and minorities to win the primary, but avoid losing fiscally moderate suburban voters in the general. This mechanical, calculating approach to politics is one reason voters discount political promises and the politicians who make them.<br />Donald Trump upended all this. He doesn’t carefully tailor his message or stick to tested and approved sound bites. His more straightforward, undisciplined approach elicits a visceral reaction from voters. Mr. Trump’s supporters are famously loyal, and his opponents suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. Nobody is ambivalent about the president. He has his base’s trust precisely because he isn’t judicious with his words. While they often cringe at his demeanor, they trust him to say what he thinks.<br />Mr. Trump isn’t unique in harnessing his emotional connection with voters to create a durable bond. Policy has always been necessary but insufficient in politics. People vote in large part based on feelings, in addition to policy views. Mr. Trump gives his supporters permission to believe in America and be proudly patriotic. The working-class voters who form his base cheer his opposition to unfair trade deals and liberal immigration policies that they think threaten their jobs, but also adore him for his willingness to fight the elites that look down on them and him. Similarly, there are people who prefer Mr. Trump’s fiscal policies, but voted for Joe Biden because the president made their hearts recoil.<br />Liberals have long contended that conservatives use emotional appeals to manipulate working-class voters into voting against their own economic interests. These appeals, supposedly grounded in patriotic, faith-based or racist rhetoric, are held to fool voters into supporting Republicans who do the bidding of the rich. How else can Democrats explain the millions of multiethnic, working-class voters who refuse to vote for their candidates and won’t support tax increases on the wealthy, redistribution programs and entitlement expansion?</td>

      <td>Unions might resist, but most Democrats now agree that economic isolation is a losing proposition.</td>
      <td>President-elect Joe Biden probably wishes he could avoid trade policy. He can’t. To re-establish partnerships with allies, devise rules for a changing world economy, and prepare the American labor force for the future, Mr. Biden will have to defuse Donald Trump’s trade wars and connect his economic and foreign policies. The press reported on Wednesday that Mr. Biden will nominate Katherine Tai, a talented trade lawyer with experience in Congress, to be U.S. Trade Representative. Ms. Tai has an opportunity to reshape policy and realign trade politics.<br />Since 1947, America’s leadership has included setting the world’s trade agenda. Yet last month, without U.S. participation, 15 other countries in the Asia-Pacific, including China and U.S. allies, signed a new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership to establish rules for the most dynamic 30% of the world economy. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, launched in 2018, drew from provisions in U.S. free-trade agreements. But President Trump dropped out.<br />Countries around the world are negotiating the business standards of the future. The new architects of international economics are adapting to changes in supply chains, including the move to digital platforms and services. The U.S. has instead been preoccupied with raising tariffs. If the U.S. doesn’t show up for modern trade negotiations, it can hardly expect to set the rules.<br />The Biden administration has an opportunity to build a new domestic coalition for trade. In a 2020 survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75% of Democrats agreed that the economic connections of globalization are “mostly good” for the country. A bipartisan 74% said trade is good for the economy and 59% think trade creates jobs at home. Groups ranging from digital denizens to farmers know that economic isolationism is a loser. Even so, Mr. Biden’s political advisers may be inclined to bury the trade topic to avoid fights with labor unions.<br />A new Biden approach should highlight the digital economy, environmental goods and services, and health supplies, as well as intellectual property and agriculture. Accords can advance American values by including terms that boost transparency, fight corruption, and strengthen the rule of law, including for labor rights. The administration should combine its trade agenda with development plans, for example with Africa and Central America, and with carbon and biodiversity goals.</td>

      <td>As the coronavirus shuttered cinemas, first-run films moved online, and while home-viewing might not equal a packed theater, there were still plenty of standout movies to see.</td>
      <td>I remember the days. Of driving off to screening rooms and watching movies on big screens. Of going to multiplexes around town for previews of action adventures on enormous screens. Plenty of new movies have been released for streaming since the Covid-19 pandemic shut down theaters in March. Obviously, though, it hasn’t been the same. There’s a gnawing sense of loss for movie lovers. Of the spectacle that was usually pleasurable, even if the substance wasn’t so great. Of the nourishing ritual—not the popcorn or Milk Duds, though they were swell too, but the social ritual of sitting in the dark and sharing movies with people you did and didn’t know. (This is not the time to dwell on negatives like sticky floors and spectators chattering on their cellphones.)<br />There is also, speaking personally, a sense of fear—that the theatrical experience I’ve thrilled to since childhood may not be long for this world, even after the virus is gone. The outlook grew much darker when Warner Bros. announced that it would release its entire 2021 slate of theatrical films simultaneously in theaters and on its HBO Max streaming service. So much for movie theaters as a sacred domain of motion pictures; that quaint notion was already endangered by other studios shrinking the length of time new movies play in theaters before being released to home video.<br />Will the new Warner Bros. strategy apply only to next year’s films, or will it become the permanent normal? Will competitors follow suit? Whatever happens, the handwriting is on the big screen. Theater chains are already staggering under unprecedented debt loads, and their long-term survival depends in large part on shopping malls whose own prospects are iffy. And many independent theaters may not attempt to reopen, indie films having begun an inexorable transformation into online-only events.<br />As if corporate maneuverings weren’t sufficient reason to worry about the medium’s future, the pandemic has accelerated our national embrace of streaming channels at home. And no wonder, given vast program choices, fees that are reasonable compared with multiplex ticket and concession prices, and hurtling advances in home-theater technology. Watching films on the spacious flat screen in my living room—I’ve just upgraded to 65 from 55 inches—can be a very pleasant experience. It is almost, dare I say it, like going to the movies. There, I’ve said it, so let me remind you of a few films I’ve enjoyed thus far in this strangest of years—not the usual Ten Best, since the holiday release season hasn’t run its full course, but enough good ones to help keep movie love alive.<br />“First Cow” was the first victim of Covid-19 closings. Kelly Reichardt’s poetic vision of frontier life and entrepreneurship circa 1820 opened in four theaters, to ecstatic reviews, on March 6. Nine days later it was pulled from what would have been expanding national theatrical release as the pandemic exploded and movie theaters shut down. Partial justice was done in July, when the film went on streaming platforms for rental or purchase.</td>

      <td>EMMA Grueskin, a 25-year-old project manager for a furniture dealer, recently moved into her first apartment, a Brooklyn walk-up. Decorating indecision plagued her, but she couldn’t afford an interior designer. Then she stumbled on an unexpected source of personalized décor advice: Instagram.<br />As the app has become a thriving marketplace, the account owners behind some design “boutiques” have started serving as personal shoppers and on-demand decorators. They’ll happily scour estate and garage sales for clients in hopes of forming fruitful bonds, as Ms. Grueskin discovered.<br />In the accounts recommended to her by Instagram’s algorithm, she came across a shop called Frost Road House that fellow Brooklynite Gina Reese had launched in June, eager to turn her thrifting hobby into a lockdown side hustle. Ms. Grueskin eyed a photo of tempered glass bottles and trays, then realized it had been sold. She direct messaged Ms. Reese, who offered to create a custom bundle of bottles based on Ms. Grueskin’s specs and a photo of her bedroom. “It’s hard starting from scratch,” Ms. Grueskin admitted. “Having a relationship with someone who I know has good taste and is sourcing quality items is really helpful and cool.”<br />Covid-19 has inspired other Instagrammers to offer similar services. Mirrors of Magic’s Emma Rhoads, who paints custom designs on vintage mirrors, and Lucite Lust’s Jenny Ko, who sells contemporary and vintage homeware, also launched their shops in the past six months. “There’s so much space-shifting with the pandemic. I love helping people figure out who they want to be visually for this new stage in their life,” said Mx.

      <td>The timing of the vaccine rollout could make things awkward for the Federal Reserve</td>
      <td>U.S. inflation readings are almost certainly heading higher next year. The trick will be figuring out whether they are signal or noise.<br />The Labor Department on Thursday reported that consumer prices rose 0.2% in November, putting them 1.2% higher than a year earlier. Prices excluding food and energy items—the so-called core that economists see as a better reflection of inflation’s underlying trend—were up 0.2% on the month and 1.6% on the year.<br />The inflation indexes the Federal Reserve focuses on, from the Commerce Department, run a bit cooler than the Labor Department measures, so for now inflation isn’t within spitting distance of the 2% the central bank is aiming for. That could change soon.<br />A big reason the year-over-year inflation readings are low now is that there was a dip in prices in March through May, when the Covid crisis first struck. Come next March, that shock will start reaching its first anniversary, and the year-over-year comparisons will appear souped-up as a result. If over the next half year prices on a monthly basis rise by just half as much as they did in November, for example, the Labor Department’s headline inflation measure would be up 2.6% on the year by May, with core prices up 2.3%.<br />But the cycling out of last year’s inflation dip won’t be the only thing going on next spring. By then millions of Americans will likely have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, relaxing safety measures just as warm weather returns. The likely result is a surge in demand, particularly in services categories such as travel.</td>

      <td>For the Time Capsule series, we spotlight a cherished restaurant, hotel or landmark that’s changed remarkably little over the years. This week, we visit Great St. Bernard Hospice in Switzerland.<br />Switzerland’s Great St. Bernard Hospice is a bona fide antiquity. A complex of structures perched above the tree line at 8,114 feet—cradled in the aptly named Valley of Desolation—it predates the Swiss-Italian border, just a few yards away. The oldest parts of the structure date to the 11th century, when an Italian vicar, later canonized as St. Bernard of Menthon, built it as a monastery and a refuge for Rome-bound pilgrims crossing the precarious, bandit-riddled transalpine pass. By the 1670s, the monks weren’t just sheltering weary travelers but a breed of jowly pups, descendants of Asiatic hounds. Christened St. Bernards, the dogs were trained to help rescue wayward wanderers and bred at the hospice until 2004. They were hardly the only famous guests. In 1800, Napoleon was nursed back to health in one of the rooms while crossing with 40,000 men and 500 horses. Years later, Charles Dickens, thoroughly chilled by the hospice and its mortuary filled with “the unclaimed,” described Great-St.-Bernard as a “great hollow on the top of a range of dreadful mountains.”<br />A still-active monastery and inn (and part of the Via Francigena pilgrim route running from Canterbury to Rome), the hospice can only be reached by car from June to mid October. In winter, visitors must snowshoe up steep slopes from the shuttered Super St. Bernard Resort, about a two-hour drive from Geneva or Turin. The 90-minute climb is arduous, but the backcountry ski back down is rewarding. Ditto for the hospice’s hospitality. The exteriors might retain their colorless austerity, but they harbor an interior with crackling fires; carved wood ceilings; long, unexpectedly convivial lunches; and generously refilled wine carafes. While a fancy 30-room auberge opened within the hospice a few years back, it only operates in summer and early fall. Otherwise, standard dorms and a few private rooms make for a spare stay. Winter guests must bring their own sleeping bag, or purchase one there. Now, under the Covid-19 regulations, masks are mandatory too, but even that isn’t new: This isn’t the hospice’s first pandemic.<br />A brief history of St. Bernard dogs<br />1670s The monks at Great St. Bernard Hospice begin breeding Swiss alpine dogs.</td>

      <td>How can investors who missed out on  Tesla Inc.  sleep at night? The electric-car company is up 12,551% since the close on the day of its 2010 IPO, enough to turn a modest $10,000 holding into a $1.3 million luxury beach house. It was possible to make the same return by buying the broad market—but only if you invested in 1973. This was the deal of a lifetime; regret, thy name is Elon.<br />If you missed it, you’re in good company. Tesla has only recently stopped being the most-shorted major stock, and only because those betting against it lost too much money. I missed Tesla too, initially seeing it as only a niche sports-car stock and later scoffing at Elon Musk’s grand ambition. And while obviously I’d like an extra $1 million as much as the next guy, I’m not distressed that I missed out.<br />Investors can’t afford regret. Every day brings new opportunities to become very rich, most of which we are bound to miss. Tesla’s 125-fold increase isn’t even the best gain since it listed. That honor, at least among the top 3,000 stocks in the U.S., goes to  Xpel Inc.,  which makes film to protect car paintwork. It was a penny stock with a market value of a bit more than half a million dollars when Tesla came to market, and has since soared almost 170,000%, leaving Tesla in the dust.<br />None of us who missed Xpel are kicking ourselves. Penny stocks—even those on reputable markets like the Nasdaq, as Xpel is—don’t usually do anything special. They are difficult and costly to trade, hard to find information on and often deeply troubled. Many vanish without a trace.<br />There is plenty of scope for disappointment among larger stocks, too. There are nine companies trading today that have lost more than 99% of their value since June 2010. Plenty of others fell to zero.</td>

Europe has been hit much harder than the U.S. and other advanced economies as strict lockdowns have repeatedly closed businesses and hurt the south’s large tourism industry.<br />Together with a new €750 billion joint fund that European Union leaders are expected to finalize this week, the decision underscores Europe’s willingness to combat this year’s economic downturn using new debt. That marks a shift in strategy from the region’s debt crisis a decade ago, when many governments sought to quickly tighten their purse strings.<br />Markets were muted following the ECB’s decision, though yields on Italian government debt, the riskiest among the area’s major economies, hovered near multiyear lows, indicating that investors were comfortable with the bank’s efforts to keep the financial system flush with cash.<br />They will now turn to ECB President Christine Lagarde’s news conference, starting at 8:30 a.m. ET, where she will explain the reasoning behind the decision and unveil fresh forecasts for economic growth and inflation.</td>

The catalog will also no longer be published online.<br />Like an international version of the  Sears  catalog, which ceased publication in 1993, the IKEA book sold not only housewares, but a lifestyle. Each year’s version usually took on a theme connected to the home—2020’s was “sleep”—while promoting the company’s compact, Scandinavian aesthetic for everything from cheap futons to custom kitchen redesigns that can cost thousands of dollars.<br />“It was an opportunity to sit down and dream,” said Marthinus Strydom, who previously worked as creative director on IKEA’s ad campaigns. “A lot of people are sad to see it go. It occupied a cultural spot in brand marketing. It was special.”<br />As web shopping surged over the past two decades, IKEA said fewer and fewer people were using its catalog. A spokeswoman said that, in the course of testing new formats and ways to distribute the catalog, the company found it wasn’t worth the investment anymore.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—When  Facebook Inc.  acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, U.S. antitrust enforcers reviewed the deals but made no attempt to block them.<br />So why is the government challenging those acquisitions now?<br />The question drives at the heart of lawsuits filed Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission and 48 states and territories. The lawsuits accuse Facebook of acquiring the Instagram photo-sharing app and WhatsApp messaging service as part of an illegal strategy to monopolize social networking and foreclose competition.<br />Effectively, officials are arguing this: Look at the forest, not the individual trees.<br />“Our enforcement action challenges more than just the acquisitions: We are challenging a multiyear course of conduct,” the FTC wrote in a question-and-answer document published Wednesday.</td>

      <td>Worker applications for unemployment benefits rose sharply last week, an indication layoffs remain at a high level nearly nine months into the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, rose by 137,000 to a seasonally adjusted 853,000 in the week ended Dec. 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. That marked the highest level of applications since September, but was still well down from a peak of nearly seven million earlier in the March 28 week.<br />Jobless claims have mostly trended down since the spring, when the pandemic caused widespread business shutdowns. That matches with other measures showing the economy is recovering, but at a slower pace in recent months.<br />Jobless claims data has been viewed as a bellwether for economists and policy makers for a half-century. However, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, last month said jobless claims have contained inconsistent data because of the pandemic-related surge in applications and attempted fraud. The Labor Department said it doesn’t plan to change its methodology. Economists also caution the claims figures can be volatile from week to week, especially around holiday periods.<br />“Job destruction has not come to an end,” Andy Challenger, senior vice president at outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., said before Thursday’s data. “We might be gaining jobs overall, but thousands of people are losing their jobs every week because demand has not returned.”</td>

A van driven by Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham was found to contain an undetonated pipe bomb. Officials said the two had planned the attack for months while traveling and living in Bayonne, N.J., and Ohio, and had a history of making statements against police and Jewish people.<br />Mayor Steven Fulop, who is Jewish, said in an interview that the incident left deep wounds across the city, traumatizing Jewish residents, members of law enforcement and members of the city’s Black community.<br />In the months since the attack, city officials have worked to counter anti-Semitism and strengthen tactical preparedness, Mr. Fulop said, by holding meetings with community leaders and residents, and implementing training for officers.</td>

The nearly six-year-old company billed itself as a technology provider and used an online platform to transact with property owners and tenants. It went public in the U.S. in January this year.<br />Danke also relied heavily on an unusual financing model. Most tenants of the more than 419,000 apartments it manages took out rental loans from online lenders. The lump sums these individuals borrowed—typically for a year’s rent—went to Danke, which paid some of it to landlords monthly or quarterly, and used the rest to help fund apartment renovations, maintenance services and its operations. Renters paid down the loans in monthly installments to lenders.<br />At the end of 2019, Danke had the equivalent of $420 million in short-term liabilities from “rent financing,” making up a little more than half its total borrowings.</td>

The U.S. and Australia have taken more forceful stands against pressure from China, sparking public fights and trade battles.<br />The annual China-EU CEO and Former Senior Officials Dialogue—a closed-door event that includes around 40 chief executives, top officials and academics from Europe and China—would have been its fourth edition and taken place this year by videoconference.<br />In previous years, participant lists weren’t controversial, organizers say. But this year, European organizers at BusinessEurope, an umbrella organization for the European Union’s national business lobbies, rejected Chinese demands to exclude certain participants.<br />The event’s cancellation offers a fresh sign of Europe’s hardening stance toward Beijing, a shift that became evident last year when the bloc described China as a systemic rival, and was underscored during the coronavirus pandemic with senior EU officials blaming China for disinformation. But the reluctance on both sides to escalate this conflict and the organizers’ insistence that another dialogue should take place again next year highlight the conflicting forces at play.</td>

Costs jumped five-fold between 2015 and 2019. The pandemic forced the company to shed a quarter of staff, remove noncore businesses and drastically cut sales and marketing, a big expense.</td>

Russia expects to produce just two million doses by the end of the year, down from the 30 million promised over the summer.<br />“We were all excited when 30 million doses were promised,” said Dmitry Kulish, professor at Moscow-based private research institute Skoltech, which focuses on pharmaceutical innovation. “But that was a hyper-optimistic forecast. We are more realistic now.”<br />To help ramp up production, Russian authorities have turned to a clutch of companies including BIOCAD, a private-sector pharmaceutical company that hasn’t been involved in vaccine work before. Hundreds of its scientists and technicians are now racing to find ways to transform small amounts of the vaccine into tens of millions of doses.<br />“Scaling is a complex process,” said Dmitry Morozov, BIOCAD’s chief executive. “What was effective in the lab may not be replicated in large volumes.”</td>

It fined Amazon €35 million for the same violations.<br />Since the CNIL informed Google and Amazon of its investigations earlier this year, each company has updated its website in Europe to stop placing advertising cookies before asking for consent, the CNIL said Thursday. But the regulator added that the companies still don’t properly explain how the cookies are used, and ordered both companies to better inform users within three month—or face further fines of €100,000 a day.<br />Google stands by its privacy efforts in Europe, a company spokesman said, and is considering whether to appeal the CNIL decision. The decision “overlooks these efforts and doesn’t account for the fact that French rules and regulatory guidance are uncertain and constantly evolving,” he said.<br />An Amazon spokesman said the company disagrees with the decision, and complies with privacy laws. “We continuously update our privacy practices to ensure that we meet the evolving needs and expectations of customers and regulators,” he said. He didn’t reply when asked if the company plans to appeal.</td>

She didn’t say when the sanctions would take effect.<br />Beijing’s announcement comes after the White House placed 14 senior Chinese officials on its sanctions blacklist on Monday. The Trump administration said the officials had been responsible for eroding Hong Kong’s political autonomy.<br />Asked for comment on the Chinese sanctions, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing referred to a statement published on their website earlier on Thursday, expressing “the United States’ deep concerns over Beijing’s ongoing assault against the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people guaranteed to them in the Sino-U.K. Joint Declaration.”</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—As they prepare to roll out Covid-19 vaccines, governments world-wide are grappling with how to keep track of those who have been immunized.<br />Many developed countries maintain lists of who has received vaccines, but those registries can rely on incomplete data provided voluntarily by doctors, pharmacies and even health-care providers that distribute flu shots to corporate clients in winter. The U.S. doesn’t have a national database, but states and some localities maintain their own.<br />Health experts say it will be crucial for governments to monitor accurately who gets inoculated, particularly because many vaccines are under development and some are expected to require multiple doses. Widespread tracking would also enable health officials to detect any adverse reactions, which is important because the vaccines are being developed much faster than usual.<br />“It is mandatory to have this kind of information to protect the health of the population,” said Terry Slevin, chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia. Government health officials there plan to require health-care providers to report who gets a coronavirus vaccine to that country’s register.<br />Requiring reporting presents several challenges to authorities, including the security of patient health data. Early in the pandemic, an Australian government initiative to develop an app that would record whether someone was in contact with anyone infected with the coronavirus foundered when many people avoided it on privacy grounds.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY— Rio Tinto  PLC’s destruction of two ancient caves in Australia to expand an iron-ore mine could have ramifications for global commodity markets if local lawmakers intensify scrutiny of mining activities that threaten heritage sites.<br />Among the most controversial recommendations made by a federal-government inquiry into the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia in May is a moratorium on expansions of existing mines or new pits that encroach on sites of cultural or historical significance. Even if lawmakers opt for a less hard-line approach, experts warn of potential delays to production and higher costs that could affect supply of key raw materials such as iron ore, used to make steel.<br />None of the recommendations handed down by the inquiry in its interim report on Wednesday are binding, but miners risk inflaming tensions with some investors who feel the industry needs to show greater sensitivity to environmental and cultural issues if they don’t accept them. They also face sensitive negotiations with indigenous groups that are the traditional owners of the land.<br />Metals prices have been rallying as China’s economy bounces back strongly and other major markets recover from the coronavirus crisis. Copper prices have risen to their highest level in almost eight years. Iron ore is one of the best-performing assets this year, fetching $150.75 a metric ton on Wednesday, its highest price since early 2013.<br />China’s unexpectedly strong appetite for these commodities has raised concerns over whether there is enough supply, with many analysts predicting market deficits for iron ore and copper through at least the middle of next year.</td>

      <td>A favorable recommendation is expected, paving the way for FDA to grant emergency authorization</td>
      <td>A panel of outside medical experts is set to convene Thursday to advise the Food and Drug Administration about the first Covid-19 vaccine the agency is considering for broad use among the American public.<br />The vaccine, from  Pfizer Inc.  and its German partner,  BioNTech SE ,  has already been shown in clinical research to reduce the rate of symptomatic disease by 95% and seems certain to get a thumbs-up from both the committee and the FDA. The FDA isn’t required to accept the decision of an advisory panel, but generally does so.<br />The 23-member Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is likely to authorize use of the vaccine, according to Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan health researcher who chairs the advisory committee.<br />Dr. Monto said that assessment is based on data released Tuesday showing that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and 95% effective, with adverse reactions rare despite a range of modest side effects such as headaches and fatigue that occur soon after injections.<br />The panel’s meeting will be public and live-streamed. FDA officials hope the discussion will show the care with which the vaccine’s safety has been reviewed—part of a broader effort to convince the public that the vaccine hasn’t been rushed to market for political expediency.</td>

      <td>Lawsuits filed by FTC and 46 states allege company engaged in campaign to acquire or stymie nascent tech companies that could become rivals</td>
      <td>The Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against  Facebook Inc.  puts the regulatory spotlight on the deal-making history of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, who has personally engineered the tech giant’s biggest acquisitions.<br />The FTC and a group of 46 states in separate antitrust lawsuits on Wednesday alleged that Facebook engaged in a yearslong campaign to acquire or stymie nascent technology companies that it feared could become rivals. The FTC said it was seeking court relief that could include forcing Facebook to sell two of its biggest acquisitions: messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing app Instagram, which competition authorities previously chose not to challenge.<br />The claims put the CEO’s competitive behavior front and center. Since co-founding the social network in his dorm as a Harvard sophomore, Mr. Zuckerberg has closely managed its approach to rivals, including the deals for Instagram, WhatsApp and virtual-reality company Oculus VR, which have helped make Facebook into a giant with a market value of around $800 billion.<br />Facebook said that the complaints amounted to “revisionist history” and that the company’s success was based on investment, innovation and value to users and customers. The Instagram and WhatsApp deals “were intended to provide better products for the people who use them, and they unquestionably did,” Facebook General Counsel Jennifer Newstead said in a statement.<br />Mr. Zuckerberg’s internal discussions about some of those deals, made public through Wednesday’s complaints and through previous litigation and inquiries into Facebook’s practices, have laid bare his competitive concerns over the years with upstarts that had comparatively tiny user bases.</td>

      <td>Military endorsement could bring novel electric vehicles closer to reality</td>
      <td>Flying taxis, which one day may whisk passengers around town without pilots, are getting a boost from the U.S. military.<br />The Air Force has issued a first-of-its-kind safety endorsement of an electric-powered vehicle similar to a helicopter, opening the door to using such commercially developed equipment for military missions. This initial stamp of approval is meant to lay the groundwork for eventual civilian certification of the technology and even approval of autonomous flights crossing American cities, industry and military officials said. The current version does require a pilot.<br />For now, the impact of the Air Force’s decision, expected to be announced as soon as Thursday, is limited. It means Joby Aviation, a Northern California startup, will become the first maker of novel vertical-takeoff-and-landing craft providing transportation for the U.S. armed services.<br />The Air Force will help accelerate safety analyses by conducting flight tests, pledging to pay for contracts seeking to verify vehicle reliability and generally vetting the capabilities of vehicles through direct and indirect funding of the company.<br />The Air Force intends to help jump-start the budding industry to enhance American competitiveness. The process is expected to take years, but the race to develop air taxis already has attracted significant investments from companies including  Boeing Co. ,  Toyota Motor Corp. , South Korea’s  Hyundai Motor Group  and  Airbus SE .</td>

      <td>The Taiwanese dollar, Chinese yuan and Korean won are each up by around 6% against the U.S. dollar so far this year, climbing as the countries’ trade surpluses have ballooned during the pandemic. On Wednesday, the yuan briefly moved below 6.50 to the U.S. dollar for the first time in about 2½ years.<br />The rally is taking those Asian currencies to levels the countries’ exporters and governments are less comfortable with, raising the possibility of renewed tension with the U.S. Treasury Department if they try to damp the pace of appreciation.<br />In November, China recorded its largest month-on-month increase in foreign-exchange reserves in seven years, South Korea the largest rise in 10 years, and Taiwan the largest increase ever. Foreign-exchange reserves tend to rise when countries intervene to prevent appreciation by buying dollar-denominated assets.<br />Both South Korea and China are already on the Treasury Department’s monitoring list for being designated as currency manipulators, which means they fit at least one of the three criteria—significant current account surpluses, significant bilateral trade surpluses with the U.S., and persistent one-sided intervention in the foreign-exchange markets.<br />The incoming U.S. administration is likely to have a different attitude to currency manipulation, but that won’t necessarily mean an easier ride for Seoul, Taipei or Beijing. As with trade-related issues, the incoming administration is expected to be more predictable and rules-oriented but not necessarily any more permissive.</td>

      <td>Tsinghua Unigroup Co., a key player in China’s push for self-reliance in semiconductors, is in default on nearly $2.5 billion of international bonds, in the latest instance of financial stress in China spilling over into global markets.<br />Late Wednesday, a unit of the company said it expected not to repay principal or the last chunk of interest on $450 million of bonds due Thursday. A separate filing said that would trigger cross-defaults on a further $2 billion in dollar bonds—three issues, coming due between 2021 and 2028.<br />The missed payments come as China’s central and local governments become more selective in bailing out ailing borrowers, both at home and abroad. Some analysts and investors believe authorities are pushing forward with a campaign to clear out unviable companies and dispel the idea that government-backed companies’ creditors will always be made whole.<br />Last month, Tsinghua Unigroup defaulted on a privately placed domestic bond worth 1.3 billion yuan, or the equivalent of $199 million. Alongside defaults by a major coal company and the parent of  BMW AG’s  Chinese joint-venture partner, it unsettled participants in China’s bond markets.<br />The chip maker’s dollar debt has been trading at deep discounts to face value, suggesting investors already doubted they would be repaid in full. The unit that issued the $450 million note said that it and Tsinghua Unigroup were “looking into various ways to solve their current liquidity issue.”</td>

Under the resolution, the company also must report to the SEC for a one-year period on its policies and controls related to accounting and disclosure.<br />GE said no changes to prior financial statements are required. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement that puts the matter behind us,” the company said. “Under the current leadership team, we have significantly enhanced our disclosures and internal controls and are a stronger company today.”</td>

      <td>CEO Elon Musk says test flight, without crew, validated rocketship’s launch, ascent and some key airborne maneuvers</td>
      <td>Elon Musk’s space-transportation company SpaceX blasted its Starship spacecraft nearly 8 miles high and maneuvered it back seemingly to a pinpoint landing, but then suffered a spectacular explosion as the vehicle failed to slow down before smashing into the ground.<br />Wednesday’s sequence of events even prompted an elated Mr. Musk initially to post a message on Twitter that the 16-story Starship prototype executed a key airborne maneuver precisely and made it back to the designated landing point. Checking the craft’s ability to control its direction during descent was one of the main reasons for the flight, the first high-altitude test of the private vehicle designed to explore the solar system.<br />But within minutes, after a video feed showed a fireball at the instant of touchdown, Mr. Musk posted a follow-up tweet explaining that low fuel pressure “during the landing burn contributed to the high touchdown velocity and the massive explosion.”<br />Still, the company’s founder and chief technical officer added there was good news because the team “got all the data” it needed during the mission. “It appears everything is in order for future tests,” he said.<br />Weeks before launch, Mr. Musk had sought to tamp down expectations by predicting a 1-in-3 chance of success for the test of the reusable craft, which uses a complex midair maneuver that flips it from nose-down to a final nose-up descent. That abrupt movement—which industry officials say hasn’t been successfully executed before by any other big booster—is one of the most challenging aspects of Starship’s flight profile. Preparing for the flight, Mr. Musk promised the company would show real-time footage of the test, “warts and all”—something he had eschewed for some earlier Starship tests.</td>

The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “AI.” The IPO raised $651 million for the company.<br />“This was a financing to enable the company to meet growing demand,” said Mr. Siebel, the company’s chairman and chief executive. “We have the funds sufficient to do our job.

      <td>Netflix reveals the top ten lists for non-English films and series in the U.S.; comedies and romances are out, action is very much in</td>
      <td>One of the most popular foreign movies on  Netflix  in the U.S. is “Kidnapping Stella,” a German thriller about a pregnant hostage who battles and outwits her captors. It’s relatively low on subtitles or dubbed dialogue, lacks obscure cultural references and fits into an easily recognizable genre. Americans are one of its biggest audiences.<br />“We tried to make the film look international and not German,” said writer-director Thomas Sieben, adding that Americans helped his film reach nearly 19 million global views in its first four weeks on the platform. “You have to really work hard to give the film the best look so that people don’t say, ‘Ugh, this looks like a typical German movie, I hate it.’ ”<br />The global hits on Netflix in the U.S. are a long way from the esoteric fare that has defined foreign art on screen for years. Gone are the days of French bohemians (“Jules et Jim”), Italian clowns (“La Strada”) and a German horse head full of eels (“The Tin Drum”). Now it’s high-speed car chases, invincible heroes and post-apocalyptic showdowns.<br />In an effort to grow its world-wide audience, Netflix has been steadily increasing its catalog of foreign programming, giving Americans access to more international films and series than ever. Netflix shared with The Wall Street Journal the top 10 foreign-language films and TV shows most popular with U.S. audiences. Not a single comedy or meet-cute romance made it onto the lists. Instead, the rankings were dominated by gritty fare like thrillers and action movies.<br />Deadly viruses propel the plots of the South Korean film “#Alive,” the Russian series “To the Lake” and the Danish show “The Rain.” Children go missing in the German series “Dark” and “Kidnapping Stella,” a German remake of a British movie. Corrupt police drive the action in the French films “Lost Bullet” and “Rogue City.”</td>

      <td>U.S. antitrust authorities have been examining for more than a year whether Facebook used its market position to stifle competition</td>
      <td>The Federal Trade Commission and a group of 48 attorneys general have filed antitrust lawsuits against  Facebook Inc.  The Wall Street Journal previously reported that a focus of antitrust probes were the company’s past acquisitions of potential competitors, such as photo-sharing service Instagram. Here’s a look at why Facebook’s past deal activity is under scrutiny:<br />What does the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit allege?<br />The FTC alleges Facebook, founded in 2004, maintained a monopoly in the U.S. by acquiring companies that presented competitive threats. “After identifying two significant competitive threats to its dominant position—Instagram and WhatsApp—Facebook moved to squelch those threats by buying the companies, reflecting Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s view, expressed in a 2008 email, that ‘it is better to buy than compete,’” the lawsuit said.<br />The agency also accused the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company of anticompetitive conduct in how third-party apps access information from Facebook. In the lawsuit the FTC said the company made certain application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-party apps only if they refrained from providing core functions similar to what Facebook offered.<br />What do the state attorneys general allege?</td>

      <td>Decades of cuts left the U.S. fleet at almost 1916 levels, but President Trump is changing all that.</td>
      <td>The Trump administration this week is taking an important step to quicken the U.S. Navy’s buildup after its disastrous decline under previous administrations. By the Obama administration’s last year, after decades of cuts to shipbuilding and maintenance, the Navy had been stripped down to a fleet barely larger than it was 100 years ago. These 275 ships struggled to meet America’s national-security needs, leaving crews stressed, basic maintenance deferred, and the country at risk. The shipbuilding industrial base shrank to a fraction of the manufacturing might that won the Cold War.<br />Mr. Trump has made it a priority to expand the fleet to 355 battle-force ships and strengthen America’s maritime supremacy. This “blue water” strategic approach deters U.S. adversaries, allows America to project power abroad, and over time offers a cost-effective alternative to endless deployments overseas. As a maritime nation, the U.S. depends on control of the sea to protect its people as well as the flow of cargo.<br />The Trump administration has steadily increased the number and readiness of battle-force ships and Thursday will move to accelerate that buildup. The White House will release a 30-year shipbuilding plan that devotes the resources necessary to making a 355-ship fleet a reality.<br />The seminal document is the result of an unprecedented nine-month study of naval force structure by the Pentagon. It provides a detailed blueprint to lawmakers and industry partners, reinforcing the American commitment to maintaining maritime supremacy.<br />The plan will provide a battle force of 355 vessels within 10 years and nearly 400 within 20 years. It will end the decadeslong decline in attack submarines by building three a year beginning in 2025, with a goal of 80. It will more than double the number of small multimission ships to nearly 70. The backbone of this ship class will be the new Constellation-class frigates, and the Navy will need a second shipyard to increase the pace of construction. The workhorses of the fleet, Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, will be modernized.</td>

      <td>His current Covid relief demands contradict his own bill from July.</td>
      <td>Democrats are outraged this week that the White House rejected their demand for four more months of $300 in weekly enhanced jobless payments in Covid relief talks. “That is unacceptable,” thundered Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in a statement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Would he say the same about legislation he introduced in July with Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden?<br />The Senators’ bill would set up a tiered system to replace the Cares Act’s $600 extra in weekly federal benefits, which expired July 31. Folks in states with an unemployment rate of 11% or higher—calculated as a three-month average—would continue to get the extra $600. But that amount would decrease by $100 for each percentage-point drop in a state’s unemployment rate.<br />Jobless workers in a state with a 6% to 7% unemployment rate would receive only an extra $100 a week. The bill “would tie the extension of enhanced UI benefits to economic data—not politics,” Mr. Schumer said at the time. “As the need goes down, so will the benefits. As the need goes up, so will the benefits.”<br />He should look at the data now. Sixteen states including Virginia and South Carolina now have three-month-average unemployment rates (August through October, the latest data available) below 6%—meaning they wouldn’t be eligible for extra benefits under Mr. Schumer’s bill. Eleven states would land in the $100 tier. Only 11 states and Washington, D.C., would qualify for $300 or more.<br />Unemployment has been falling, especially in states that haven’t reimposed lockdowns. Mr. Schumer’s New York has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country at 9.6%. Like California (9.3%), it continues to enforce some of the strictest limitations on businesses and restaurants.</td>

Nasdaq is now offering “Limited time, complimentary access” to “The Equilar Diversity Network.”<br />No one objects to board diversity, but Nasdaq wants to force Americans to pay for its political signaling. The exchange said last week in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing it wants companies to have at least two “Diverse” directors. That’s defined as “one director who self-identifies as female,” and “one who self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.”<br />Oh, and if a director is gay—or has one parent who is Vietnamese—but is not interested in announcing his sexual orientation or ethnicity in public documents for enforcers at the Nasdaq to review, it doesn’t count. The directors must “self-identify” in a Nasdaq preferred category.<br />Nasdaq claims, including in a letter to these pages Wednesday, that it is only aiming for “transparency.” But the names of board members already must be disclosed. Nasdaq wants companies to list how many board members fit in each category. If companies don’t meet Nasdaq’s quota, then they must “explain why they do not” in filings or on their website—or face delisting. That’s intended as a public-relations sanction even if Nasdaq pretends it isn’t.<br />Nasdaq doesn’t have authority to order companies to comply with any political fashion, so it claims in its SEC filing that these new mandates are designed to promote “a free and open market.” This market will apparently benefit Nasdaq’s new diversity enterprise with Equilar.</td>

      <td>It’s been a rough year for California government: catastrophic wildfires, power outages, and now massive unemployment benefit fraud. It appears the progressive paragon can’t even make transfer payments without making a hash.<br />Many states have reported more fraudulent jobless benefit claims due to the pandemic Cares Act, which allowed independent contractors to qualify based on purported lost earnings. State systems weren’t designed to handle these claims. But California seems to be the biggest sap.<br />On Monday  Bank of America ,  which contracted with the state government to issue benefit debit cards, identified some $2 billion in suspicious activities with many claims filed in the names of infants, centenarians and people living outside the U.S. The bank said fraudulent payments may be financing terrorists and illicit arms purchases. “The scale of program fraud in California is unique,” the bank wrote to legislators, who are (of course) blaming the bank for freezing suspicious accounts.<br />In October federal authorities arrested a Los Angeles rapper for allegedly stealing identities to swipe $1.2 million in federal jobless benefits. The rapper flaunted his heist in a music video he posted to YouTube in which he held up stacks of pre-loaded debit cards: “You gotta sell cocaine, I just file a claim.”<br />Local law enforcement has busted several criminal rings. Last month nine district attorneys sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom warning of rampant benefit fraud in prisons. More than $140 million in benefits have been paid in the names of 20,000 state prisoners, including 133 on death row. Unlike most states, California doesn’t check claims against prison rolls.</td>

      <td>Complaint is the first enforcement action pursued under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Trump administration filed a complaint against Canada over the market access for U.S. dairy products, in the first enforcement action under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.<br />U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Wednesday that Canada has hampered the ability of American dairy farmers and producers to sell their products, by using quotas that prefer Canadian producers.<br />In a letter to his Canadian counterpart, Mr. Lighthizer said the U.S. was exercising its rights to enforce the USMCA, adding that Washington may request the establishment of a USMCA dispute-settlement panel if the U.S.’s concerns aren’t addressed.<br />“Canada’s measures violate its commitments and harm U.S dairy farmers and producers,” Mr. Lighthizer said in a written statement. “We are disappointed that Canada’s policies have made this first ever enforcement action under the USMCA necessary to ensure compliance with the agreement.”<br />A spokeswoman for Mary Ng, Canada’s minister of small business, export promotion and international trade, said her country was “in full compliance with its commitments” under the USMCA.</td>

      <td>It’s poetic that when the U.K. began its Covid vaccinations Tuesday, the second person to receive an injection was 81-year-old William Shakespeare from Warwickshire, his famous namesake’s home county.<br />“When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions,” the Bard wrote in “Hamlet,” using words that aptly describe this awful year. The coronavirus has brought death, suffering, sorrow, isolation, despair and economic ruin. But even as dark winter approaches, we’re sustained by something else: hope.<br />It comes in the form of vaccines, which typically take years, even decades, to develop—never mind manufacturing and distributing them in quantities large enough to achieve “herd immunity” and make viral spread highly unlikely.<br />Yet here we are, less than a year after the coronavirus hit, with multiple effective vaccines tested, approved in some countries, and mass-produced. It’ll take months to make billions more, distribute them and inoculate people in numbers large enough to end this global pandemic, so we aren’t out of the woods yet. But we’re witnessing modern science’s amazing ingenuity, creativity and results.<br />Credit for the unprecedented speed in developing these vaccines goes to scientists and researchers who worked endless hours and showed incredible skill. Credit also goes to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, which gave critical resources and expeditious approvals to pharmaceutical companies.</td>

      <td>Stripping OMB staffers of civil-service protection will make it harder for the president to do his job.</td>
      <td>We served as presidential appointees in the Office of Management and Budget under Republican and Democratic administrations, and we disagree on plenty. But we are in complete accord that OMB’s career professionals are essential for effective government. They bring deep knowledge—built up over years, sometimes decades—of how government works, which approaches to policy have succeeded or failed, and why.<br />That’s why we are alarmed by reports that OMB Director Russell Vought has, in the waning days of the administration, reclassified 88% of the OMB’s career staff into a new Schedule F category that means they can be hired and fired at will on political grounds. The move was a hasty effort to implement an executive order from President Trump that overturned more than a century of civil service law to exert greater political control over government employees in “policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions.”<br />The OMB is a unique government institution in that it is located in the Executive Office of the President but is staffed largely by career civil servants who don’t change with each administration. Unlike agencies with particular missions, like environmental protection, agriculture, energy, etc., the OMB has a crosscutting perspective that covers the whole executive branch—coordinating budgets, regulatory policy, management priorities, information policy, and more.<br />The OMB office we each headed, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, has a staff of fewer than 60 career civil servants. Many have served multiple presidents, and can help political officials better understand when federal regulations are consistent with the president’s priorities as well as with longstanding law and administrative practice. Their nonpolitical positions allow them to provide objective and informed advice. The OMB’s political appointees make the ultimate policy decisions, but those decisions can and often do reflect the sound, evidence-based advice and institutional memory of the career staff.<br />The role of career OMB staff is particularly critical during transitions between administrations. A new administration couldn’t possibly produce a budget within a couple months of taking office without a staff of experienced budget examiners with institutional knowledge of the myriad federal programs and agencies. Presidents throughout their administrations, and especially at the beginning and end of their terms, need career OIRA staff to advise on regulatory actions to ensure they are defensible and durable.</td>

      <td>The digital economy should have a code of conduct that enhances competition and encourages innovation.</td>
      <td>The antitrust cases against Google and now  Facebook  are a welcome reinvigoration of the government’s power to stop monopolization. The cases, however, aren’t enough. They will become drawn-out legal battles and will likely leave many anticompetitive practices unchanged. The U.S. should complement its litigation approach by following the lead of the British government, which recently announced the creation of a new regulatory body, the Digital Markets Unit, to enforce a code of conduct for the digital economy.<br />Digital giants like Google and Facebook dominate the internet in part because they have developed great products. But they are also gigantic because they make it harder for other companies to enter the market and compete. This reduces the quality of their offerings, limits choices for consumers, and inhibits innovation.<br />The challenge for policy makers is how to preserve what’s good about the digital giants while moving the digital economy toward the promise of capitalism, in which competition supports vibrant innovation and benefits consumers. Better enforcement of merger and antitrust law can play a role, but the best approach would be to establish new pro-competition regulation to specify the rules of the road, providing greater certainty for companies large and small, expanded opportunity for new companies to enter the market, and greater choice and control for consumers.<br />Numerous industries have become more concentrated in recent decades, increasingly dominated by smaller numbers of companies. Sometimes this happens for good reasons, like when the increased efficiency of large retailers enables them to grow and expand, leading to rising productivity and lower markups and prices. Sometimes it happens for bad reasons, such as U.S. hospital mergers that have led to minimal efficiency gains but higher prices.<br />The tech industry has become increasingly consolidated for a combination of good reasons—the network effects that accrue when many people use the same products, and economies of scale and scope—but also for bad reasons, such as a small number of companies leveraging their power in some areas to extend and protect it in others. For an example, see Google’s deals to feature its search engines on  Apple  devices.</td>

      <td>Scottsdale, Ariz.<br />The loud, boisterous house parties filled with drunk guests yelling endless profanities have stopped for now. Long-term renters, a couple from San Francisco and their dogs, have moved into the “hotel” next door.<br />Over the past few years  Airbnb  has grown up as a company. The global short-term rental platform has more than four million hosts in more than 200 countries, offices in 24 cities, and more than 2,000 employees. It has changed its practices to accommodate pandemic safety, cracked down on house parties, and set up a team to deal with issues that many neighbors of short-term rentals face daily. There’s now a 24/7 neighborhood support hotline.<br />Airbnb is set to go public Thursday, and I’ll be buying stock. My dad taught me  to invest in what I understand. After living next to a short-term rental for years, I have learned that people are always eager to unwind, relax and go on holiday. Now more than ever, many people, including me, are looking forward to traveling again once the pandemic is over.<br />If history repeats itself, the 2020s will be a big party much like the 1920s. Already many luxury travel companies are taking bookings for African safaris and trips to Antarctica through 2021 and 2022.</td>

      <td>A professor argues that we should engage with the classics, not only in spite of, but even because of, our moral differences with them.</td>
      <td>Alan Jacobs reports that, though he has been teaching old books to classrooms full of students for many years, lately when he walks into a classroom “fairly regularly the first thing I see is every head bowed before a glowing screen.” Ever-present screen-based entertainment, a 24-hour news cycle and the constant connectivity of social media place us in a constant sensory flux. This is not a hospitable environment for the study of great books, but Mr. Jacobs argues that our current predicament provides even more reason for turning to them: Reading old books promises to lengthen our “now,” situating and stabilizing us so that we become possessed of more tranquil minds and less dominated by impulse. Those who can tie themselves to the great minds of the past, Mr. Jacobs tells us, will achieve greater “temporal bandwidth.”<br />Mr. Jacobs, a professor at Baylor University, frames his book “Breaking Bread With the Dead” as an expansion of the humanistic classroom: Set aside your phones, I will teach you to pay attention to Homer, and Horace and Milton. As a fellow teacher, I was eager to see how he would encourage and invite the uninitiated reader, the one beset by an internet of distractions, to “overcome the gravitational pull of the moment” by “breaking bread with” such difficult authors. His book, a loosely linked series of essays, does not exactly deliver on this promise.<br />Much of it is given over to illustrating and defusing a potential worry: You might think we shouldn’t read old books because, to put it gently, ancient authors do not have modern moral sensibilities. Aristotle argued in favor of slavery; Shakespeare seemed to think shrews needed taming. Mr. Jacobs spends a lot of time telling us that it is possible to take the moral failings of a work seriously without dismissing its virtues, but he rarely pauses to mount a thorough defense of any particular author.<br />Mr. Jacobs’s concern is not so much to tell us how to sort through individual cases as to encourage and exhort us: Serious engagement with old books is possible not only in spite of, but even because of, our moral differences with them. But why did this point need to be hammered home? In my classroom experience—and I would be very surprised to hear that Mr. Jacobs’s differs—the problem that the uninitiated have with “The Iliad” is not that they are offended by its sexism. Yes, it is true that women are conceived as prizes, but this is not why people struggle to partake of the wonders of Homer. Students struggle because they are bored and confused.<br />Mr. Jacobs is right that there are real wonders in “The Iliad”; he is right to say that when “old King Priam goes to his knees to beg his son’s killer for his son’s body, a powerful electrical current leaps across the millennia.” But this scene comes in Book 24, and that means you have to get through 23 books of Greek epic first. I would describe getting through those 23 books as the main problem my students face in relation to “The Iliad.”</td>

Failure to reach a deal would mean from the start of next year tariffs would be applied for the first time in almost a half-century on some trade between the U.K. and the EU, to which it sends 43% of its exports.<br />After the discussion, a senior U.K. government official said “very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged.” The two leaders “agreed that by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks.”<br />Mrs. von der Leyen also said in a statement that the two sides were “far apart.” She said that negotiating teams would immediately resume talks “to try to resolve these essential issues.”</td>
