      <td>DeVos says President Trump’s rhetoric contributed to deadly mob attack on Capitol Hill</td>
      <td>Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resigned Thursday night, becoming the second member of President Trump’s cabinet to quit since the deadly mob attack on Capitol Hill, which she said was fueled by Mr. Trump’s rhetoric.<br />“We should be highlighting and celebrating your Administration’s many accomplishments on behalf of the American people,” Mrs. DeVos wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump obtained by The Wall Street Journal. “Instead we are left to clean up the mess caused by violent protesters overrunning the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the people’s business. That behavior was unconscionable for our country. There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me.”<br />Her resignation is effective Friday. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said earlier Thursday she would resign, citing the “entirely avoidable” storming of the Capitol building.<br />Mrs. DeVos had been one of the administration’s longest-serving cabinet members—and one of its most polarizing. When the Senate confirmed her nomination in February 2017, she was the first cabinet nominee in U.S. history to require a tiebreaking vote from the vice president—in this case, Mike Pence.<br />Teachers’ unions and progressive activists had strongly opposed her for her lifelong work promoting charter schools, which are publicly funded but often run by private firms. Mrs. DeVos, a Michigan billionaire, also supported vouchers, which use tax dollars to enable students to attend private schools.</td>

Warnock to congratulate him and to wish him well in serving this great state,” Ms. Loeffler told supporters in a video released by her campaign Thursday evening.<br />Ms. Loeffler pledged to continue fighting for conservative values and against “the radical agenda of the left.”<br />“I fully intend to stay in this fight for freedom, for our values, and for the future of this great country,” she said.<br />Ms. Loeffler—appointed last year to fill a Senate seat vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson, who retired due to illness—ran in a special election against Mr. Warnock, the pastor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s former church in Atlanta, to finish two years of that term.</td>

      <td>Readers may recall when James Bennet was sacked as Opinion editor of the  New York Times  last year for running an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton suggesting that the military should be called in to quell urban riots. We disagreed with Mr. Cotton at the time but defended Mr. Bennet.<br />Well, the editor returned from exile Thursday with a guest appearance writing Politico’s daily newsletter. “You may have last seen me getting bounced out of The New York Times for running an opinion piece by Sen. TOM COTTON (R-Ark.) arguing for the use of military troops to prevent the rioting that accompanied some of the peaceful protests over the summer,” Mr. Bennet wrote. “As our editorials made clear, I disagreed with Cotton then (that’s one reason I supported running the piece). And so I hope it doesn’t make me a hypocrite now to say that I wish the military had been out in force Wednesday to stop the rioting and protect what Biden called the ‘citadel of liberty.’”<br />Fair point, sir, and welcome back. We’d note that many Democrats are also lamenting the failure of the Capitol police to stop the mob (see nearby). Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan is predicting that some will be fired. We’re also glad to publish Mr. Cotton nearby making a similar point about policing, even if others find it too controversial.</td>

      <td>Americans deserve to know why Congress’s police force failed.</td>
      <td>Pro-Trump rioters shamed the nation Wednesday as they stormed Congress. The chaos was also a failure of law enforcement, and Americans deserve answers about how a violent mob could breach the barricades, enter the Capitol and interrupt the counting of electoral votes.<br />Four people died, with one woman shot by police and three others succumbing to what officials described as “medical emergencies.” D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department says some 56 officers were injured, including one who remains in the hospital after a crowd beat and tased him.<br />Police found pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican party headquarters and they discovered a cooler with Molotov cocktails and a gun on Capitol grounds. Rioters set off chemical irritants, attacked law enforcement with metal pipes, shattered windows, and broke into lawmakers’ offices. Americans watched in horror and adversaries with glee.<br />The question is how the U.S. Capitol Police force of some 2,300 officers was overwhelmed. A Capitol Police spokeswoman didn’t respond to our emails or phone calls. Chief Steven Sund said in a statement Thursday that officers’ actions were “heroic given the situation they faced,” adding that “the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was unlike any I have ever experienced in my 30 years in law enforcement here in Washington, D.C.”<br />Mr. Sund has promised a “thorough review." In a failure of intelligence, the Capitol Police seems to have underestimated the potential for violence. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that “talk of guns and potential violence is rife” on Telegram messaging channels, the social-media website Parler, and the online forum thedonald.win.</td>

      <td>The only description that makes sense is a venting of pent-up resentments.</td>
      <td>Insurrections are common but Wednesday’s aborted insurrection on Capitol Hill was unique. The usual purpose of mobilizing a mass of people and deploying their sheer momentum against the edifices of power, a royal or presidential palace, or a parliament is to seize power—through the act of seizing that iconic building. But that is logically impossible when the ruler is not the enemy to be replaced but rather the intended beneficiary of the insurrection.<br />What happened was certainly not an attempted coup d’état, either. Coups must be subterranean, silent conspiracies that emerge only when the executors move into the seats of power to start issuing orders as the new government. A very large, very noisy and colorful gathering cannot attempt a coup.<br />There have been quite a few cases around the world of what is best described as mass intimidation directed against parliaments. But in all such cases it was some specific law that was wanted or not wanted, which legislators under the gun might then vote for or against. For that to happen, the legislators have to be all gathered in the legislature and kept there to be coerced. Most recently in Beirut last August, Lebanon’s Parliament was besieged by a crowd demanding and forcing the government’s resignation. This conspicuously did not happen in Washington on Wednesday because it was a crowd that invaded the building, not snatch teams sent to seize individual legislators to be cajoled or forced into their seats.<br />Given all these exclusions, only one description remains: a venting of accumulated resentments. Those who voted for President Trump saw his electoral victory denied in 2016 by numerous loud voices calling for “resistance” as if the president-elect were an invading foreign army. These voices were eagerly relayed and magnified by mass media, emphatically including pro-Trump media.<br />Then they saw his victory sullied by constantly repeated accusations of collusion with Russia from chairmen of intelligence committees and ex-intelligence chiefs who habitually accused Mr. Trump of being Vladimir Putin’s agent, claiming they had secret information, which, alas, they could not disclose. They deplored Mr. Trump’s “subservience” to Mr. Putin weekly for four years while refusing to entertain the possibility that in a confrontation with China, it might be a good idea to overlook Mr. Putin’s sins, as Nixon embraced Mao to counter the Soviet Union.</td>

      <td>Alejandro N. Mayorkas was only 1 when his parents, fleeing communist Cuba, came to the U.S.  His mother’s family had escaped the Holocaust in Romania, arriving in Cuba in the 1940s. From an early age, Mr. Mayorkas learned to love America, inspired by parents who knew tyranny all too well. Now President-elect Biden has nominated him to lead the Homeland Security Department. If confirmed, he will be the first immigrant to hold the job.<br />Mr. Mayorkas grew up in Los Angeles and went to law school. After a few years in private practice, he began his career of public service as an assistant U.S. attorney specializing in white-collar crimes—including Operation Polar Cap, the largest money laundering case in the nation at that time. He would go on to lead the Central District of California as U.S. attorney from 1998-2001.<br />He returned to federal service in 2009 as director of citizenship and immigrations services at Homeland Security and was responsible for the largest and most complex immigration system in the world. In this role, he realigned the agency’s organizational structure. He enhanced and streamlined many of its programs, including the electronic immigration system and the initiative to police the unauthorized practice of immigration law.<br />In 2013 Mr. Mayorkas was appointed deputy secretary. In that role, he developed strong relationships with the law-enforcement community, including the Fraternal Order of Police.  Thanks to his vision and leadership, we strengthened cooperation between local and state police agencies and their federal counterparts at DHS. His professionalism, integrity and commitment to just and fair enforcement of the law makes him an ideal candidate to lead the department.<br />Mr. Mayorkas has pursued criminal wrongdoers and has protected the rights of the innocent with indefatigable vigor. His work reflects all that is right in government.</td>

      <td>Last year was one of the weariest we can remember. It brought school conducted behind screens, fewer trips to restaurants, and no escapes to the ballgame. The weekly routine of sitting in a church pew on Sunday morning is gone for many. How can we not be weary?<br />Having both worked in the National Football League for decades, we are creatures of routine. Our habits and the structure they create provide us with steadiness, but this went out the window in 2020. We would handle this better if we knew when the pandemic will end, but we do not know what tomorrow holds.<br />Our weariness goes far beyond schedule changes. The challenges drained our collective spirit: violence in American cities; a seemingly never-ending divisive election cycle; apparent helplessness in the face of the virus. Americans’ trust in government, media and even the church continued to diminish. This heightened our anger and left us searching for answers.<br />The racial injustice and division in this country weighs heavily on us too. We acknowledge the progress made, but we are not blind to the long road ahead. We have been buoyed by so many who have become willing to have difficult discussions, learn about this country’s past and present, and acknowledge that all of us need to listen more than we talk.<br />As men of means with strong families, we had it relatively easy. Frontline workers were stretched beyond capacity in 2020. Many friends and family have lost jobs and even lives. The communal grief normally shared at funerals and memorial services is often borne alone.</td>

      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />If you flipped on the morning talk shows last Sunday to hear Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious-disease expert, you’d be forgiven if you momentarily thought he was spinning a yarn from science fiction.<br />“We’ve isolated multiple examples of the mutant being in this country, so there’s no doubt it’s here,” Dr. Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” And on ABC’s “This Week,” he said, “That mutant is already here in the United States. It’s been well-reported.”<br />The “mutant” that Dr. Fauci was describing doesn’t come out of the pages of a comic book. Rather, it is the dangerous new strain of coronavirus that emerged in the U.K. and has rapidly spread to other countries. Many epidemiologists have observed that the latest mutation is a more contagious form, though it does not appear to make the resulting disease more severe.<br />The word “mutant,” much like a mutant virus strain, has evolved in unexpected directions over centuries of usage. It originated in Latin as “mutantem” meaning “changing,” from the verb “mutare.” That same root for “change” also spawned such words as “mutate,” “commute,” “transmute” and even “molt.”</td>

      <td>In Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó’s English-language debut, a woman struggles to cope after her home birth ends in tragedy.</td>
      <td>‘Pieces of a Woman,” streaming on Netflix, poses a startling question with shattering force. What does a woman do after her pregnancy has ended in a death instead of a new life? Vanessa Kirby is Martha, a Boston woman whose home birth goes disastrously wrong. No mainstream production has ever depicted a childbirth like this one, and Ms. Kirby’s performance is remarkable—not only when Martha is in extremis but once she’s back in what used to be her life, mourning her loss as she surveys the world around her like a benumbed alien from a distant planet. Yet another question is posed by the spectacle of Martha’s delivery, which was shot in a single take that occupies most of the first half hour of running time. Does the rest of the film live up to such an agonizing and yet commanding beginning? Unfortunately it does not, despite the presence of a star who manages to navigate a cluttered narrative with clarity and solemn grace.<br />This is Ms. Kirby’s first leading role in a feature, although anyone who saw her as Princess Margaret in the first two seasons of “The Crown” knows she illuminated every scene she was in with a quicksilver mix of ambition, sardonic wit and heedless passion. Here she’s working, often powerfully, with a much darker emotional spectrum. Martha’s anxiety billows out into horror as she realizes that her obstetric complications are spinning beyond the control of her terrified midwife, Eva (a fine performance by Molly Parker). During the year that follows, Martha is either shut down, acting out melodramatically or lashing out at her explosive, immature partner, Sean (Shia LaBeouf), a recovering alcoholic unable to cope with his own grief, and at her manipulative mother, Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn), a Holocaust survivor obsessed with revenge in the form of a trial that will send the midwife to prison.<br />It’s a lot, to say the least, and there’s also a mercifully brief subplot involving Sean and a criminal attorney, Suzanne (Sarah Snook), who is part of Martha’s family. The strange thing, though, is that after being moved and frightened by the birth scene (“You’re doing so great,” Sean keeps saying anxiously when that’s clearly not the case); after following Martha through a succession of new torments on her journey toward an elusive peace that proves to be absurdly unconvincing, we still have no real understanding of who she is. Or how her relationship with Sean may have worked before the tragedy; it’s hard to imagine they were ever a natural fit. Or why they decided on a home birth in the first place.<br />Instead of creating the kind of texture and narrative flow that allows characters to reveal themselves gradually and fully, the film devotes increasing attention and lots of clumsy plotting to the question of litigation—can anything be gained by making someone pay for an irretrievable loss? It’s a subject addressed with far more finesse in “The Sweet Hereafter,” Atom Egoyan’s 1997 screen version of the Russell Banks novel.<br />“Pieces of a Woman” was directed by Kornél Mundruczó, working from a screenplay by his real-life partner, Kata Wéber. (A few years ago Mr. Mundruczó did a brilliantly original Hungarian-language feature called “White God,” a parable of ethnic and racial hatred in contemporary Europe in which an army of dogs turns Budapest into a sister city of Pamplona.) Their new film, which was photographed in elegant chiaroscuro by Benjamin Loeb, grew out of the couple’s own loss of a child, an experience they first dramatized in a 2018 stage play of the same name that she wrote and he directed in a successful Warsaw production.</td>

      <td>The Mint Theater streams its exceptional 2018 revival of a Lillian Hellman strike-breaking drama that all but vanished for eight decades.</td>
      <td>One of the few welcome surprises of 2020 was the announcement by New York’s Mint Theater that it had spent the preceding seven years taping broadcast-ready three-camera archival videos of its off-Broadway productions, and that in lieu of live performances during the pandemic, it would stream these videos for free. As regular readers of this column know, the Mint specializes in small-house revivals of unjustly forgotten 20th-century plays. I have been reviewing one or two of its shows most seasons for the past decade and a half, and each one I’ve seen has been well chosen and flawlessly acted and staged. No other theater company in America has a more consistently high record of artistic quality.<br />“Days to Come,” the second of 10 plays by Lillian Hellman to open on Broadway in her lifetime, is one of the most significant of the Mint’s recent revivals, for the original production closed in 1936 after just seven performances and disappeared almost without a trace (prior to the Mint’s 2018 staging, which I saw and reviewed, it appears to have had only one revival anywhere). Most flops close for self-evident reasons, but there is no obvious reason why “Days to Come” did so: It is an extremely strong piece of work, worthy of direct comparison with such better-known Hellman scripts as “The Children’s Hour” and “The Little Foxes,” and the Mint’s production, directed with lean clarity by J.R. Sullivan, makes so powerful a case for it that I am at a loss to understand why so excellent a play vanished from view.<br />This is all the more puzzling in light of the fact that “Days to Come” is a political play, one whose point of view is all of a piece with that of “The Little Foxes,” Hellman’s greatest stage success and one that never fails to please frequent playgoers who share her left-of-center views. It tells the tale of the Rodmans, a factory-owning family of liberals who, faced with the possibility of a strike, make the mistake of hiring a firm of tough detectives (“It’s not a tea-room business,” one of them explains to the Rodmans) who are prepared to do anything, murder very much included, to keep the men at work. Into this volatile situation walks Leo (Roderick Hill), an out-of-town labor organizer, who is no less determined to keep the strike peaceful.<br />What follows, as always with Hellman, is the stuff of solidly built melodrama, drawn with a broad brush but far from cartoonish. I think it’s fairly safe to assume that she got the idea for the play from Dashiell Hammett, her longtime companion, who had worked as a union-busting Pinkerton operative before embracing hard-left politics (and, later in life, unabashed Stalinism) and, in 1929, published “Red Harvest,” a hard-boiled mystery novel whose plot unmistakably prefigures that of “Days to Come.” But Hammett had no gift for playwriting, while Hellman was a master of the well-made play, and though “Days to Come” occasionally stoops to progressive sermonizing, it mostly sticks to down-the-center storytelling.<br />Reviewing a Mint production is a nightmare for critics who thrive on picking flaws. The cast is very well chosen, especially Janie Brookshire, who plays the matriarch of the Rodman family. Harry Feiner, the set designer, has fit two naturalistic interiors onto the Beckett Theatre’s revolving stage—a neat piece of scenic prestidigitation for a 99-seat off-Broadway house, and one of a kind for which the Mint is justly celebrated. (You can actually see the set being changed during the intermission.) Some of the camera angles show the first row of the audience, whose presence is audible without being in any way intrusive. That’s a happy, even comforting touch: You’ll come away from “Days to Come” feeling as though you’ve seen a real stage show, not a telecast.</td>

      <td>Loosely based on a bestseller by the same name, this stunning documentary reveals the inner lives of nonverbal children with autism who nonetheless find ways to express themselves.</td>
      <td>Some of the most thrilling films I know have explored or discovered the intellectual and emotional life of people who cannot express what they’re thinking or feeling. The list starts with “The Miracle Worker” and Helen Keller trapped in her head until a young teacher finds a way to release her. It includes “My Left Foot” (about the severely disabled writer and painter Christy Brown), “Awakenings” (long-catatonic victims of an encephalitis epidemic suddenly released from their frozen state) and “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly” (a French editor paralyzed except for his left eyelid by a rare condition called “locked-in syndrome”). Now another film joins the list, “The Reason I Jump” (in select and virtual theaters). Its newly expressive subjects have also been locked in, to varying degrees; young people on the autism spectrum, they cannot or do not speak. There’s a difference, though. This is a documentary, not a dramatized version of factual history, so we’re getting news bulletins direct from hearts and minds.<br />The title is taken from the Naoki Higashida book that gives the film its form, a slim but celebrated volume, at once concrete and poetic, whose subtitle is “The Inner Voice of a Thirteen-Year-Old Boy With Autism.” When the book came out in an English translation in 2013 it was a revelation, a first-hand, first-mind account of the young Japanese author’s passionate, turbulent and phenomenally rich inner life. The film, directed by Jerry Rothwell, interweaves spoken excerpts from the book—the English-language narrator is Jordan O’Donegan—with intimate portraits from around the world of other nonspeakers with autism. Nonspeakers of out-loud words, that is, since these five remarkable youngsters make paintings, or spell out, letter by letter with pointer boards, written words and eloquent sentences that bespeak the centrality of communication in our gloriously gabby species.<br />The concept is inspired, and inspiring—kids with a misorchestration of neurons, if that’s what it is, escaping from solitary confinement. More than that, the film is beautiful—the cinematography, by Ruben Woodin Dechamps, combines objective views of the subjects and their parents or teachers with startling visual analogues of the ways people with autism perceive the world they inhabit. And “The Reason I Jump” is deeply informative. I thought I had a rudimentary understanding of the repetitive gestures or extreme introversion that may be manifestations of autism, but I tacitly assumed that being on the spectrum implied some degree of emotional impairment. So much for assumptions. Seeing the film, then reading the book that prompted it, swept all of that away.<br />In 2006 Mr. Rothwell co-directed, with Louise Osmond, a haunting documentary called “Deep Water.” The subject was an Englishman named Donald Crowhurst who, in 1968, set off on a solitary circumnavigation of the globe. Delusional about his skills as a sailor, Crowhurst had no aptitude for the months of spiritual isolation that lay ahead, and his voyage became a suicide mission. “The Reason I Jump” is also about spiritual isolation, and what’s required to transcend it.<br />The instrument of literal breakthrough for several of the film’s subjects has been the pointer board. It helps to enhance motor control for people who can’t write, let alone speak, and to organize cyclonic swirls of thoughts by reducing them to the basic units of written language, i.e. letters. One of the most stirring moments of the film comes when a previously uncommunicative and obviously bright young man named Ben declares joyously, “I never thought this was possible.”</td>

      <td>A documentary examines the life of Elizebeth Friedman, who helped take down Nazis and bootleggers like Al Capone; James Herriot’s tales of an English vet are adapted, winningly, once again.</td>
      <td>Hoping to inspire ambition in his U-boat captains in 1942, Adolf Hitler offered a prize of $250,000 to any who succeeded in sinking the Queen Mary, a passenger liner converted into a troop ship. Guided by coded messages, the U-boats found their intended target off the coast of Brazil. This would lead, of course, to no prizes, nor would the Queen Mary suffer any damage; decrypted messages delivered to the captain enabled him to maneuver the ship to safety. These were warnings made possible—as “The Codebreaker” (Monday, 9 p.m., PBS) reveals—thanks to Elizebeth Friedman, a suburban wife and mother, and a skilled cryptanalyst. Friedman—who had long led a double life—initially put her skills to work for the police, and went on to serve the U.S. military. “The Codebreaker” (an “American Experience” film) delivers an irresistible picture of her life and career in all its complexity.<br />Friedman first became something of a celebrity during the Prohibition era, when the Coast Guard—faced with a ceaseless flood of liquor coming into the country by ship—persuaded her to turn her attention to the secret messages used by the transporters of this illegal cargo. The gangsters in charge had developed impressively sophisticated codes for their business transmissions, though none were a match for Friedman. She delivered so much hard evidence of criminality, all of it the bulletproof kind, that the Coast Guard built a code-breaking unit especially for her in 1931—the first to be run by a woman. When criminal elements put a hit out on her, the Coast Guard arranged for a protective detail. A commentator notes that “It would never have occurred to her not to testify.” These people had to be put away. “That was the whole point of breaking the codes.” No comment in this affecting work better expresses the film’s regard for its subject.<br />Friedman would go on to become the chief witness in sensational criminal trials, including that of Al Capone—whose defense attorneys regularly suggested that she was engaged in a female flight of imagination, if not some version of witchcraft, and that breaking codes had nothing to do with science. She did manage, against the protests of the defense attorneys, to persuade a judge to give her access to a blackboard, whereupon she delivered a detailed lesson on codebreaking. The defense attorneys were left with little to say.<br />Nothing in Elizebeth Friedman’s early life—she was the youngest of 10 children born to a Quaker family in Indiana—had ever given her cause to imagine that she would one day have an essential role in defeating Hitler’s plan to sink the Queen Mary, or that her work would lead to the destruction of a Nazi spy ring in Latin America, or that she would become an immense threat to some of America’s most notorious criminals.<br />During the war, she came to know the meaning of a woman’s place even within a team of her own creation. After Pearl Harbor, her codebreaking unit was shifted from the Coast Guard to the Navy, which put a uniformed male officer with far less cryptanalytical experience than she had in charge of her unit. The Navy, the film explains, had a rule that women couldn’t be in charge of men.</td>

      <td>Yield on 10-year note at highest since March; worries over securities ban drag down Chinese corporate bond prices</td>
      <td>U.S. government-bond yields rose faster than many expected after Democrats won control of the Senate, with traders focusing on the potential of more economic stimulus and the return of long-muted inflation.<br />The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note closed at 1.07% Thursday, according to data from Tradeweb, up from 1.041% Wednesday and 0.955% Tuesday before a pair of runoff elections in Georgia gave Democrats slim majorities in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Thursday’s closing level is the highest since March and marks the largest four-day yield gain since after the U.S. elections in November.<br />“The move is clearly on the larger side of what we expected,” said Timothy High, an interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas, who had anticipated before the vote that a Democratic victory would boost yields by 0.05 to 0.10 percentage point.<br />How much higher yields can go depends in large part on whether the incoming Biden administration rolls out stimulus packages that go beyond pandemic relief into other areas, such as infrastructure construction, Mr. High said.<br />Increased fiscal spending would be financed through the sale of more Treasury bonds, a supply surge that many expect to push prices down and yields up. A combination of rising rates and mounting debt loads increases investors’ expectations for inflation as the government prints money to cover higher debt costs.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The electronic filing system used by federal courts has likely been compromised in the massive  SolarWinds  hack, federal judiciary officials said, extending to another branch of government the impact of a suspected Russian cyber-espionage campaign that has breached more than half a dozen Trump administration agencies.<br />The federal judiciary was working to immediately add new security procedures to protect “highly sensitive confidential documents filed with the courts,” according to a statement Wednesday by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.<br />“An apparent compromise of the confidentiality of the [filing] system due to these discovered vulnerabilities currently is under investigation,” the statement said. “Due to the nature of the attacks, the review of this matter and its impact is ongoing.”<br />Beginning Wednesday, highly sensitive court documents filed with federal courts on paper or via secure electronic devices will be stored in a stand-alone computer system, according to the statement, and won’t be uploaded as usual to the electronic case-filing system. The new procedure wouldn’t change public access to court records because sealed records already aren’t available to the public, it said.<br />Gaining access to confidential judiciary records could be especially valuable to foreign spies, analysts said, because of the extreme sensitivity of information they often contain, including investigative techniques described in search warrants or specific email accounts or phone numbers being surveilled.</td>

Since then, the Trump administration has used sanctions and other censure, though Beijing has pressed on with its crackdown on the democracy camp.<br />While those tools remain available, Beijing’s decision to conduct the sweep weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office shows that control over Hong Kong takes priority over resetting relations with the U.S.<br />“If one had hoped that Beijing might pause on the Hong Kong crackdown in order to create better conditions to engage with the incoming Biden administration, that hope has been dashed,” said Tom Kellogg, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law. “The fact that one of the arrestees is an American citizen will further strain ties once the Biden administration takes office.”<br />A spokesman for the Biden transition had no immediate comment on what steps could be taken to support democracy advocates in the Chinese territory. Mr. Biden’s pick for secretary of state, Tony Blinken, said in a tweet that the Biden administration “will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing’s crackdown on democracy.”</td>

      <td>Removal of widely followed president may hurt engagement, but social network needs to bear the cost</td>
      <td>Twitter  investors may be worried about a future without President Trump. They should instead consider it the cost of doing business.<br />The social-media platform was in sharp focus Thursday following a tumultuous day in which the president encouraged supporters at a rally to march on the U.S. capitol just as Congress was working to formally certify his opponent’s election victory. That march turned into a riot that resulted in the building’s security being breached and attendees being evacuated.<br />The day’s events resulted in Mr. Trump’s Twitter account being suspended. Rival platform  Facebook  suspended Trump’s account for twice as long before Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced Thursday morning that the suspension would hold “indefinitely”—at least to the end of the president’s term in two weeks.<br />But only Twitter paid a price with investors. The company’s stock slipped 1.8% by the closing bell while Facebook’s gained 2%—a rise roughly in line with a broad uptick for major tech stocks. The difference makes some sense given Trump’s outsize impact on the platform he favored for years even before becoming president. Mr. Trump’s main Twitter account has nearly 89 million followers, which represents about 48% of the company’s total base of monetizable daily active users last reported at the end of the third quarter. Mr. Trump’s Facebook account boasts about 35 million followers—less than 2% of the company’s 1.8 billion daily active users.<br />Mr. Trump’s future on Twitter is certainly debatable—even if the company allows him to remain for now. He has established a long record of skirting the platform’s rules about posting misinformation and harmful content. And the legitimately thorny question of whether to deplatform the world’s most powerful political leader no longer holds after he leaves office later this month. Twitter already faces the risk of weaker user engagement in the months ahead, with the prospect of a less volatile U.S. political environment and a weakening pandemic as vaccines get rolled out. A strong spike in usage in early 2020 as the pandemic flared creates a very challenging comparison, at least for this year’s first two quarters.</td>

      <td>Suspended tariffs grew out of digital-services tax dispute with France</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. on Thursday suspended plans to impose tariffs of 25% on French luxury goods in response to France’s tax on big tech companies like  Facebook Inc.  and  Amazon.com Inc.,  saying it wants to coordinate its response with its efforts in similar disputes with other countries.<br />The U.S. Trade Representative threatened to impose the tariffs last year, in retaliation for France’s 3% levy on certain revenue from big technology companies, which the U.S. said unfairly targeted American businesses. The tariffs had been scheduled to take effect Wednesday.<br />The suspension of the tariffs on French products was welcomed by U.S. importers and retailers that had criticized such punitive tariffs as a tool that aims to protect one industry at the expense of another, while hurting American consumers.<br />The decision puts the onus on President-elect Joe Biden and his administration to address increasing demands by other countries for global technology companies to pay more taxes where their customers are located.<br />“The Biden administration is being given the opportunity to implement their own strategy on discriminatory digital taxes,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), the likely next chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “America is going to have to respond. Many of these unilateral taxes have been designed to target American companies that are generating high-skill, high-wage jobs.”</td>

      <td>Researchers warn that the new variant may spread faster and could reduce the efficacy of vaccines</td>
      <td>A new variant of the coronavirus is driving a powerful second wave of infections in South Africa. The variant has already spread to other countries in Africa and Europe and raised concerns over how it will respond to Covid-19 vaccines.<br />It’s normal for viruses to mutate, and variants observed so far in the coronavirus sweeping the globe have made little difference to how it functions. The South African variant, known as B.1.351, has worried scientists because of its unusually large number of mutations, especially in the spike protein, which the virus uses to attach to and infect human cells.<br />The discovery and spread of the South African variant has coincided with a powerful surge in infections in the country. New daily cases and deaths have already surpassed those seen in the first wave, which peaked in July, and infections are still going up. South African researchers say they also believe that the new variant is more transmissible, since it has quickly crowded out other versions of the virus circulating in the country. Still, they say human behavior—with thousands of South Africans crowding into bars, restaurants and beaches—is likely the main reason for the sharp rise in infections in recent weeks. They are now racing to understand how much more transmissible the new variant is and whether it leads to more severe cases of Covid-19.<br />No cases of the South African variant have been detected in the U.S., but that may be because not enough positive test samples have been sequenced. In the past two weeks, laboratories in Finland, the U.K., Australia, Switzerland, Japan and South Korea have found the South African variant in coronavirus tests conducted there. Researchers in neighboring Zambia say the South African variant now also appears to be the dominant virus there.<br />The scientists who sequenced the South African variant’s genome say it has a mutation—known as N501—that it shares with a separate variant discovered in the U.K. British scientists say that mutation may be responsible for making the variant there much more transmissible.</td>

More than 12,000 health workers took part in Phase 3 trials in Brazil, the first country to complete tests of Sinovac’s vaccine.<br />“It’s a great result,” said Luiz Carlos Dias, part of a Covid-19 task force of researchers at the University of Campinas in São Paulo state. “If it can prevent severe cases, hospitalizations, deaths, it will help get us out of this pandemic.”<br />CoronaVac’s vaccine is less effective then those being developed by Moderna Inc. and jointly by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE that have shown to have efficacy rates of 94.5% and 95% in testing, respectively. But CoronaVac can be kept in a standard refrigerator between about 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, making it easier and cheaper to transport and store in less developed countries, infectious disease specialists said.<br />Prashant Yadav, a global health specialist at Washington-based think tank Center for Global Development, said 78% is a high enough rate for many developing countries to consider using the vaccine and potentially good enough for the World Health Organization to consider incorporating CoronaVac into its global distribution system.</td>

      <td>WITH AMERICANS desperate to escape their cramped confines, bike sales have soared along with Covid-19, increasing by 62% between January and October 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, according to market research firm NPD Group. If you’re a fair-weather cyclist, however, winter’s chill poses a bump in the road—unless you protect your pandemic purchase.<br />Just like you might outfit a car with snow tires, you may need to swap in sturdier bike tires for traction on icy surfaces. Look for a thicker tread and extra siping—the thin slits that bite into ice, snow or slush—as well as built-in puncture protection to withstand debris that gets flushed into the roads, said Dylan Varekamp, service manager of NYC Velo in New York.<br />“In winter, you want to get the biggest possible tires that can fit your frame,” said Eric Jones, a bike mechanic at Boulder Bicycle Works in Colorado. They require less air pressure, which drops in cold temperatures, and cover more surface area. Continental’s Top Contact Winter II Premium tires, made of high-tech synthetic fibers, resist tears and have deep treads that grip slippery roads. You can also protect your standard tires with Tannus Armour’s foam inserts (from $70, tannusamerica.com), which fit between the tire and the tube and make a wheel “almost unflattable,” said Mr. Jones.<br />Pedaling on wet roads can kick a muddy stripe up your back and make a mess of your drivechain (which includes cranks, cogs and derailleur). Fenders, like the clip-on SKS Raceblade Pro XL set, are your first line of defense against this and weather-related rust and corrosion, said Mr. Jones.<br />That kicked-up mess isn’t just water and dirt; winter roads are rife with magnesium chloride, salt and de-icer. Those corrosive elements make cleaning your ride crucial to its longevity. “You don’t need to take a toothbrush to the cogs every day, but you should at least rinse and wipe down your bike once a week,” said Mr. Varekamp. Using isopropyl alcohol on the braking surfaces can extract winter grime, boosting your braking power and elongating the lifespan of the pads, added Mr. Jones.</td>

      <td>JOHANNESBURG—South Africa will start rolling out Covid-19 vaccines without requiring local regulatory approval of the shots, a step that other low- and middle-income countries scrambling to inoculate their populations against the coronavirus are expected to follow.<br />South Africa’s health ministry said the country will in January receive 1 million doses of the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC from the Serum Institute of India, which has an agreement to manufacture and distribute the shots. A second shipment of 500,000 doses is expected for February. The vaccine requires two doses to reach its full effect.<br />Other countries across Subsaharan Africa and the developing world are likely to emulate South Africa’s decision to bypass local regulators in an effort to expedite getting shots for at least some of their most-at-risk citizens. Some lack their own national drug-approval authorities and are expected to rely on certification from the World Health Organization for rolling out Covid-19 vaccines.<br />The shots South Africa has ordered from India will be given to health care workers, who have borne the brunt of a surge in new cases of Covid-19. Researchers believe that the new wave in infections has been exacerbated by a new, likely more transmissible variant of the coronavirus discovered in the country. In December alone, 5,000 health care workers tested positive for the disease, placing an additional burden on hospitals already struggling.<br />South Africa, a country of 60 million people, reported on Wednesday 21,832 fresh cases of Covid-19, its highest daily count, and 392 deaths. Nearly one-third of coronavirus tests are coming back positive—an indication that the true number of infections is likely much higher—and the South African Medical Research Council said it recorded nearly 7,000 excess deaths in the week of Christmas, most of them likely due to Covid-19.</td>

Every parent (or grandparent) has seen such comical yet deeply serious “experiments.”<br />Through these investigations, babies learn how to translate the jumble of photons that pass through our tiny pupils and impinge on our two-dimensional retinas into the three-dimensional world of objects that we navigate in everyday life. Other babyish meditations build up our concept of self and our explanatory models of other minds inside other bodies. These are great achievements. Researchers in artificial intelligence have struggled to replicate them, with limited success.<br />To understand reality, it’s efficient and reasonable for children to take lessons from the way things behave in the everyday world.

The electromagnetic waves that power radios and microwave ovens pass unnoticed, as do the electric flows that power our muscles and encode our thoughts. We do not have the infrared vision of snakes, the ultraviolet vision of bees, or bats’ ability to pick up ultrasound.<br />The physical world revealed by modern science is fundamentally different from the model we construct as babies. Scientific instruments let us perceive the world better than we can using only our bodies. We can use microscopes, telescopes, spectroscopes, magnetometers, particle accelerators, atomic clocks and other tools to explore the physical world’s reality.</td>

In 2019, she became the director of California’s Office of the Small Business Advocate, where she helped implement a grant program for businesses affected by the pandemic.<br />If confirmed, Ms. Guzman would lead an agency that is best known for its loan programs to provide small firms with capital and has more recently helped businesses affected by the pandemic.

Through its Office of Advocacy, the SBA also aims to advance small-business interests throughout the federal government.<br />The relatively small bureaucracy played a key role in the federal government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.

      <td>Chinese and Russian state media criticized the U.S. following the storming of Congress, calling out what they described as hypocrisy from a country whose leaders have long denounced Moscow and Beijing for undermining democratic values.<br />In pointed coverage from both countries, Chinese reports drew parallels between the scene at the Capitol and protests in Hong Kong, while Russian state-controlled outlets gloated over Wednesday’s chaos in Washington.<br />Chinese media compared Wednesday’s events and the 2019 attempt by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong to charge into the legislature, demanding the right to hold free and fair elections. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that year described the pro-democracy demonstrations then rocking the Chinese territory as “a beautiful sight to behold.”<br />In China, this phrase has become an official shorthand for a propaganda theme under the Chinese Communist Party that alleged falsehood and hypocrisy in American democracy, wrote David Bandurski, co-director of The University of Hong Kong’s China Media Project.<br />On Weibo, a Chinese social-media platform akin to  Twitter ,  the Chinese Communist Youth League captioned photos on Thursday depicting the violence and destruction in the U.S. Capitol with the same words.</td>

      <td>Some people insist fragrant skin care fosters spalike relaxation. Others find it noxious and irritating. We argue both sides.</td>
      <td>For the recurring series, That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and other emphatically opposed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />Having a stranger touch your face in a tiny, enclosed space sounds like a social-distancing nightmare today. Just a year ago, however, some people equated it with relaxation bliss. When they’d walk into a facialist’s studio and catch the aroma of rose or bergamot, all their built-up tension would melt away. That particular form of Zen might be eluding fragrance fans in 2021, but many are still turning to scented lotions, face masks and more to conjure spalike calm in the sterile safety of their bathrooms.<br />According to some beauty devotees, aromatics amp up an otherwise lackluster at-home routine. “Like a very luxe store or restaurant…[a skin-care regimen] is about the experience as much as a result,” said Phoebe Hausser, 25, who works in social-media marketing in Birmingham, Ala. She’s partial to botanic scents, like that of  Shiseido ’s  Eudermine Revitalizing Essence lotion.<br />For others, aroma enhances the “treat yourself” aspect of skin care. “You can find some really nice herbal scents” in creams and serums, said Alexis Hester, 34, a Houston attorney. “I love lemongrass and eucalyptus…You feel like you’ve just walked out of the spa.” Ms. Hester can even be transported by a tomato-based Burt’s Bees toner. If you close your eyes and inhale, you might feel like you’re in a vegetable garden—or, as Ms. Hester put it, a Whole Foods.<br />Many people—even those who enjoy olfactory stimulation—find scented skin care overpowering and unnecessary. “I already have perfume,” said Jane Lappin, 65, an automated-vehicle safety consultant in Belmont, Mass., who “recoils” from scented facial products. “Why would I put anything onto my skin that isn’t specifically enhancing its appearance or longevity?”</td>

      <td>Last quarter’s numbers for the retailer look worse than they are, but there still are good reasons to approach with caution</td>
      <td>Bed Bath & Beyond has really started to spruce the place up. It is a shame its housewarming party drew so few guests.<br />The retailer logged a 5% decline in total revenue and a 2% gain in comparable-store sales in the quarter ended Nov. 28. Both figures were lower than what analysts polled by FactSet had expected. Furthermore, the company posted a net loss of $75.4 million. Analysts had expected a profit.<br />The disappointing numbers are partly a result of Bed Bath & Beyond’s housecleaning efforts, which could make numbers worse before they get better. Without impacts from divestitures and store closures, the company would have posted a positive bottom line.<br />Below the surface, the company is showing signs of improvement. Gross margins, for example, improved by more than 3 percentage points last quarter compared with the same period a year earlier and held steady from the preceding quarter. That is actually quite a feat considering that sales were weaker compared with both periods and a much higher share of the retailer’s sales today come from e-commerce.<br />Digital sales surged 77% year over year for the entire company, which includes Buy Buy Baby. Expanding gross margins are a solid sign that the retailer has gotten savvier about promotions and merchandising. The other number to watch is the retailer’s inventory turnover, a measure of how quickly it sells and replaces items. That metric improved last quarter both compared with the prior quarter and a year earlier.</td>

      <td>Workers continued to apply for unemployment aid at an elevated level at the end of 2020 and holiday-season demand for imported consumer products pushed the November trade deficit in goods to a record, signs of the uneven economic recovery.<br />Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits from regular state programs, a proxy for layoffs, fell by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 in the week ended Jan. 2, the Labor Department said Thursday. The prior week’s figure was revised up by 3,000. Unemployment claims have been holding at about four times their pre-pandemic average through the fall and into the winter.<br />The foreign-trade gap for goods in November was the highest on records going back to 1992. The overall deficit for goods and services expanded a seasonally adjusted 8% from October to the highest level since August 2006, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The data reflects that consumers’ demand for imports outpaced global demand for U.S. exports.<br />Job losses in the past year have been particularly severe among lower-earning restaurant, hotel and mall-retail workers. Meanwhile, workers in other areas were more likely to shift to working from home and have maintained incomes to help drive demand for goods, while spending less on dining out, travel and other services.<br />Imports of consumer goods reached the highest level on record in November, led by increased shipments of cellphones, appliances, jewelry and toys, the Commerce Department said.</td>

Pharmacists lack the expertise to second-guess doctors’ judgments about the appropriate necessity of a medication and the proper dosing for a particular patient.”<br />The prospective drug-utilization-review provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, however, require pharmacists to evaluate prescribed medication to ensure it is “appropriate, medically necessary, and not likely to result in adverse events.” Ensuring pharmacists are proficient at fulfilling this responsibility is core to the training of every pharmacist.<br />The pharmacy practice act in every state actually requires the pharmacist to judge the appropriateness of the medication order and take appropriate action to ensure patient safety, including refusing to dispense the prescription, if necessary. Requiring the clinical indication or diagnosis be placed on every prescription order would dramatically improve pharmacists’ ability to fulfill this essential legal and professional responsibility.<br />Prof. Michael T.

Hunting isn’t a sport, it’s a violent and unnecessary form of entertainment. Hunters cause animals unimaginable suffering, especially when you consider that multiple studies have found that bow hunters wound but don’t kill their targets about half the time. They tear families apart, orphan the young and, for animals including wolves and geese who mate for life and live in close-knit family groups, destroy entire communities. And animals don’t need hunters to manage their herds. Deer reproduce based on food and habitat availability, so when more resources become available due to hunting, deer multiply at higher rates. Natural predators do help maintain healthy populations, selecting the sickest and weakest animals. But hunters go after the largest set of antlers to hang on their walls. “Game” managers also frequently kill off natural predators to ensure plenty of targets for hunters to shoot at.<br />Michelle Kretzer<br />People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Foundation<br />Norfolk, Va.<br /></td>

      <td>Wall Street banks have had a decent crisis so far. That is unlikely to translate to bumper bonus payments for bankers and traders, as chief executives and boards grapple with the optics of big payouts amid economic hardship on Main Street.<br />At Bank of America Corp. the bonus pool is likely to be flat, according to people familiar with the bank’s plans. Bonuses for some  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. traders are expected to rise, according to a person familiar with the situation, but not as much as the 39% increase in trading revenues at the New York-based bank in the first nine months of 2020.  Morgan Stanley  has said it would pay $1,000 bonuses to most employees making less than $150,000, but hasn’t given any guidance on payouts for higher-earning staff.<br />“It’s a bad year to have a good year,” said Gilbert Swann, a recruiter at Sheffield Haworth in London whose clients include global investment banks. “It’s not a year that people are going to get paid significantly up, so flat might be the new up.”<br />Payouts to bankers and traders are especially contentious this bonus season. Millions lost their jobs as economies were closed and businesses were bankrupted in the coronavirus pandemic. But the banking sector has largely withstood the crisis thanks to trillions of dollars of funding and support for borrowers from governments and central banks. Investment bank revenue surged as trading increased in volatile markets and companies raised fresh debt and equity.<br />Now, traders and bankers expect to be rewarded for their efforts. That is creating a dilemma for chief executives and boards who worry about how their companies are perceived by politicians, regulators and the taxpayers who will be paying for the crisis for years to come. Even the best performers may find their bonuses curtailed because of this public-perception problem.</td>

Morgan  health conference, which historically has been a preferred moment for splashy announcements, is scheduled for next week.<br />The shopping spree coincides with the dissipation of potentially disruptive threats that have spooked Wall Street in the past. Haven Health, a venture aimed at reducing health costs backed by  JPMorgan Chase ,   Berkshire Hathaway  and  Amazon.com ,  is folding roughly three years after its formation, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week.

      <td>The snarling grille on the front end of BMW’s M440i is bound to raise eyebrows. But the car’s lively engine and smooth ride will put any concerns to rest, says Dan Neil.</td>
      <td>WHEN  BMW  shows you this ink blot, what do you see? Buck teeth? Butterfly wings? Kevin Bacon? When I step back from the new M440i xDrive Coupe’s visually insistent grille to take in the whole car, I see one of those green piggies from “Angry Birds”—the rounded nostrils, the lidded eyes (laser headlamps), the broom mustache (lower grille). Is that just me?<br />I know a few Vulcans out there think matters of exterior styling are a waste of words, especially when there are slightly revised torque curves to talk about. They are so wrong. Fresher, younger, bolder styling is pivotal to BMW’s global product initiative; the großer grilles of the M440i and other new cars—signaling endowment, privilege, mammon—put a face on Munich’s edgier mood. Call it Swaggerfreude.<br />The thing about controversial BMW styling is it doesn’t stay controversial for long. The shock of the new quickly gives way to something like inevitability. When the first iteration of the mega- grille appeared—the X7 SUV, in concept and production form—it just seemed bonkers. Now, after a brief period of renormalization, it looks about right. BMW product design has frequently ventured just slightly ahead of public taste. Besides, if any aspect of the M440i should be controversial, it’s the rear aspect, not the front.<br />First, a bit of housekeeping: BMW names its sedan models starting with odd numbers (e.g., the 330i four-door) and coupes with even. Our specimen was a second-generation 4 Series coupe, sharing architecture with the 3 Series, with a big sloppy kiss from the M performance division. That includes sportier algorithms for the eight-speed transmission/AWD; the M Sport rear differential; the adaptive multi-mode M suspension; the M Variable Sport steering; the M Sport brakes. Thus the M prefix. Since all-wheel drive comes standard on M440i, I will dispense with the pleasure of the “xDrive” suffix.<br />Behind those nostrils breathes a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six (382 hp, 369 lb-ft), with an uber-fancy computerized valvetrain—fully variable valve timing and cam phasing—and high-pressure fuel injection. Lusty and gusty, with a 7,000 redline and an effectively flat torque curve from 1,800-5,000 rpm, the turbo six is an all-star, a rupturing hydrant of twist. Zero-to-60 mph is clocked at 4.3 seconds, and then it’s a brisk Bavarian elevator up to where they take your fingerprints and picture.</td>

      <td>Georgia victories give president-elect a chance to implement policies that had looked dead</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Democratic control of the Senate gives President-elect Joe Biden a much stronger chance of raising taxes on corporations and high-income households.<br />Until this week’s Georgia runoff elections, Mr. Biden’s plans for tax increases were running into solid opposition from the Republican-controlled Senate. But now, Democrats will hold the White House, Senate and House simultaneously for the first time in more than a decade, and they are poised to use that power.<br />During his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden proposed raising taxes on corporations, estates and high-income households, reversing key parts of the 2017 tax cuts passed by Republicans and reprising policies that the Obama administration couldn’t get through Congress. Democrats had spent the time between November’s election and this week’s runoffs looking at bipartisan compromises and examining what the administration could do unilaterally.<br />Now, some of Mr. Biden’s ideas are much more likely to become law, said Steve Wamhoff of the progressive Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, who said that the president-elect’s plans are less far-reaching than some Democratic alternatives and are broadly popular with the public.<br />“The issue was always, could Democrats get something on the floor? And the answer to that is now clearly ‘yes,’” Mr. Wamhoff said. “Biden did win after campaigning on raising taxes on corporations and raising taxes on the rich.”</td>

      <td>Struum aims to give customers à-la-carte access to content from hundreds of lesser-known platforms</td>
      <td>As the streaming landscape keeps getting more crowded, a new entrant is looking to help declutter it.<br />Struum, a streaming service co-founded by former  Discovery Inc.  and  Walt Disney Co.  executives, won’t offer its own slate of original programming when it launches this spring. Instead, it will aim to give customers à-la-carte access to all content from hundreds of niche streaming services, offering users a way to stream individual shows and movies from various platforms without having to subscribe to each plan separately.<br />Co-founder Paul Pastor said Struum would give more visibility to lesser-known services, which he said have “fantastic content” but have trouble “being part of someone’s daily habit,” because there is only so much money households will spend on streaming services every month.<br />The coronavirus pandemic has been a boon for major streaming services, including  Netflix Inc.,  Disney’s Hulu and  Amazon.com Inc.’s  Prime Video, whose subscriber base soared last year in the midst of growing demand for content from shut-in customers. Some 95% of U.S. households subscribe to at least one of these three services, according to Parks Associates, a research firm.<br />Former Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner, whose Tornante Co. is Struum’s main financial backer, told The Wall Street Journal that the decision to invest was a no-brainer.</td>

      <td>JPMorgan Chase’s deal for a loyalty and rewards business is the latest example of payment providers betting on the payment itself being just a part of the value chain</td>
      <td>With people traveling less and spending more on digital platforms, banks with big credit-card units may have lost some relative luster with investors. But they still have cards to play.<br />JPMorgan Chase  recently acquired the global loyalty division of cxLoyalty Group Holdings. That business serves credit-card rewards programs and helps connect them to a number of ways that rewards can be used.<br />The move suggests in part that JPMorgan Chase sees travel and cards continuing a long-running association, and the deal includes travel services. Americans may have started using different cards or scrambled to find other uses for points in 2020, and lenders have responded by upping rewards for activities such as grocery shopping and streaming. But many firms are betting that a pent-up desire for escape still exists, and spenders will be eager to use points as much as ever once more movement is feasible.<br />The deal is also notable for coming during the emergence of many technology players in payments and rewards. PayPal has been beefing up its platform that gives its users ways to use their card points, and investing in other inducements to shop, such as the digital coupon-clipping service Honey. Meanwhile, part of the buy-now-pay-later platform Afterpay’s success is that shoppers can find merchants through Afterpay, rather than just the other way around. The company said this week that referrals to partner merchants this holiday season more than doubled versus the prior year through its Shop Directory service. Afterpay also has a rewards program for users related to on-time payments.<br />A risk of this emerging payments ecosystem to card issuers is that they become somewhat secondary to the e-commerce value chain. Even if people will be traveling again, they might be shopping for that travel quite differently. By buying a rewards business, JPMorgan Chase can have a broader role, with a two-sided platform connecting customers to a wider network of merchants and ways to use rewards.</td>

      <td>Company needs new growth model. But a road trip into the frothy electric-vehicle industry might prove bumpy.</td>
      <td>Electric vehicle hopes have supercharged shares of Chinese search giant Baidu, long a laggard among Chinese tech stocks. Such a move would make a certain amount of sense for a tech company with plentiful cash and investments in artificial intelligence and automated driving. But given the lack of detail or official confirmation, investors may be getting ahead of themselves.<br />Baidu shares have surged 25% in less than a month after a report from Reuters last month said the company is considering making its own EVs and has held talks with other auto makers. Baidu’s shares had been languishing for the past couple of years and were trading at nearly half a peak in 2018 before the recent rally.<br />Baidu’s core search business is still profitable, but growth has been elusive as ByteDance, owner of short-video app TikTok, has drawn away advertising dollars with its viral content. Baidu’s search for new bright spots has turned up empty. Its online-video business  iQiyi  has been growing but remains deep in the red. Baidu’s proposition to acquire YY Live from  JOYY Inc.  in November for $3.6 billion represents an attempt to diversify into the live-streaming business.<br />Baidu’s shares indeed looked cheap before the rally. Excluding iQiyi, it has more than $10 billion in net cash and generated $1.2 billion in free cash in the September quarter. But the market doesn’t have much interest in classic value plays. It took potential involvement in EVs to finally get investors excited.<br />EV stocks skyrocketed in 2020: Tesla had a nearly 7.5 times increase, while China’s Nio had more than an 11 times increase. It makes sense for Baidu to consider making its own cars, especially when investors are paying attention to anything and everything EV-related. And a move in that direction wouldn’t be out of the blue. The company has long invested in its self-driving technology platform, Apollo. Baidu has rolled out an autonomous taxi service called Apollo Go in three Chinese cities, beginning in 2019. The company got permission in Beijing last month to deploy five vehicles for road tests without safety drivers inside the cars, a first for the country. A fully autonomous vehicle may still be years away, but having its own EVs could help showcase Baidu’s technologies.</td>

      <td>Attracting more women will be key to its growth. But getting more women to trade can be a tall task for all online brokerages.</td>
      <td>Fast-growing online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc. just capped a blockbuster year, one that saw seemingly anyone ranging from college students to retirees transform into stock-market traders.<br />Now, the company has its sights set on another demographic: female customers. Attracting more women to Robinhood’s platform will be key to its growth, especially as the company aims to evolve beyond its retail trading roots.<br />Already, some expansion is under way. The company points to its cash management feature as well as fractional trading and recurring investments features. Company executives said Robinhood would be open to expanding to new products, such as financial planning. The hope is that these will widen Robinhood’s appeal among potential customers, including women.<br />But as the broader investment industry continues shifting to holistic wealth planning that addresses investors’ long-term goals, Robinhood may be playing catch-up to other players, such as  Charles Schwab Corp.  and Fidelity Investments Inc. that already offer those services. Fidelity ended the third quarter with some $8.8 trillion in assets under administration, already has name recognition among many individual investors, thanks to its 401(k) platform, and has been operating for decades longer. Fidelity said 41% of its nearly 26 million retail brokerage accounts are held by women.<br />During 2020, the number of women on Robinhood tripled, according to the company, to reach its highest share of customers yet. Even so, they still account for a minority of users. Robinhood declined to say how many new customers it gained in 2020 but said in May that the company had more than 13 million users.</td>

      <td>Property investors want to buy grocery stores, but may struggle to convince retailers to part with them</td>
      <td>Unlikely as it may sound, grocery stores are becoming dream properties—coveted but hard to prise away from their owners. Changes to accounting rules are just one reason why it has become less appealing for supermarkets to sell their real estate.<br />In Europe, food shops have been among the few retailers allowed to trade throughout the pandemic and business has been strong. U.K. grocer J Sainsbury reported Thursday that over the nine weeks to Jan. 2, sales increased by 9.3%, sending its shares up 4%. Britain’s supermarkets have had their highest Christmas sales on record, based on data released this week by Nielsen.<br />That strength has fed through into real-estate markets, where superstores are in demand. Landlords haven’t struggled to collect rents from grocers as they have from other retailers. U.K.-listed  Supermarket Income REIT  received 100% of rents owed in the three months through September, compared with just 79% for Europe’s biggest shopping mall landlord,  Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield .  The former’s stock is roughly flat over the last 12 months, while Unibail’s has more than halved in value.<br />Growing competition to buy grocery stores is already nudging up prices. European prime supermarket rent yields tightened to 5.63% by the third quarter of 2020, according to  Savills  data, compared with 5.67% at the end of 2019. In contrast, the yield on prime shopping malls moved out over the same period as investors grew jittery about future cash flows.<br />For investors such as U.S.-listed Realty Income, which has been trying to build a portfolio of grocery stores in Britain, supply of the best assets could remain tight. Supermarket giants like Carrefour and  Tesco  have property worth billions of dollars on their books. But selling up is less appealing today than it was during the big wave of deals in the 2000s.</td>

      <td>Republicans objecting to state electors should stop and certify Joe Biden’s election by acclamation.</td>
      <td>Fueled by lies about a stolen election, protesters overran police and stormed America’s seat of government on Wednesday, forcing a lockdown of the U.S. Capitol and a 6 p.m. city curfew. This sounds like a dispatch from some foreign correspondent in an unfortunate land. Instead it was President Trump’s parting gift to Washington, and the country, for denying him a second term.<br />Wednesday’s joint session of Congress was supposed to be a ritual of American democracy, memorializing Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. As lawmakers met, Mr. Trump was speaking at a “Save America March,” where he vowed never to concede. “We’re going to the Capitol,” he urged the crowd, to “try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.”<br />There the protesters marched—and then some. After Rep. Paul Gosar and Sen. Ted Cruz objected to the counting of Arizona’s 11 electors, the two chambers retired to consider it. The Senate debate lasted less than an hour. Rioters breached the building, and the Vice President was suddenly whisked from the floor. In the House, lawmakers said they were given gas masks and told to lie on the floor. A woman was shot and killed, and police officers were injured.<br />What a disgrace. The trespassers should be arrested, and the maskless ones can probably be identified long after the fact. Where was the police presence in Washington? Once the mob was inside, the call went out for backup from Virginia and Maryland, and the National Guard was activated. But it’s a scandal that the U.S. Capitol wasn’t better protected on such a significant day.<br />To the extent that the congressional debate was allowed to happen, it went in the right direction. Mr. Trump has been publicly pressuring Mr. Pence, the presiding officer of the joint session, to invalidate Mr. Biden’s electors. As Congress gathered, Mr. Pence released a statement saying he would refuse to do so. “My oath to support and defend the Constitution,” he wrote, “constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.”</td>

      <td>National Guard, FBI and others sent to the scene after the U.S. Capitol was breached</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal authorities had planned to deal with protests this week with a relatively small, minimally visible presence, according to law-enforcement officials, hoping to avoid inflaming tensions as a show of force had done during unrest earlier this year in Portland, Ore. and other cities.<br />That approach seemed to have backfired on Wednesday, when thousands of pro-Trump rioters surrounded the U.S. Capitol and some easily breached the barricades and stormed the building, leaving at least one person shot and others injured. Some fired what the city’s police chief described as “chemical irritants” at officers who were guarding the complex to gain access to the building.<br />That left a smaller group of Capitol police officers to guard the building as lawmakers began a joint session of Congress to count the 2020 electoral votes. Those officers were quickly outnumbered as rioters approached the building. Once inside, they broke into lawmakers’ offices and roamed freely.<br />Officials said they had expected a repeat of relatively minor scuffles between far-right and far-left factions that broke out after dark at similar protests in November.<br />“The Capitol Police were unprepared for the sheer size of the protest,” said David Gomez, a retired FBI executive. Once the rioters barged into the Capitol, other federal law enforcement agencies were slow to respond, either out of deference to President Trump or because of a lack of experience with dealing with riots, which isn’t their primary mission, Mr. Gomez said. “Up until they breached the Capitol, the possibility existed that it was going to be a large protest that didn’t cross those barricades. Once they did that [law enforcement personnel] were overwhelmed and couldn’t respond quickly enough,” he said.</td>

They were in the early stages Wednesday afternoon when rioters disputing Mr. Biden’s victory over President Trump overtook the Capitol, forcing lawmakers and aides to seek shelter.<br />“We always knew this responsibility would take us into the night. The night may still be long but we are hopeful for a shorter agenda, but our purpose will be accomplished,” Mrs. Pelosi wrote.<br />Many lawmakers had been eager to resume the certification of the vote, saying they didn’t want to let the mob prevent them from fulfilling their constitutional role.</td>

The developments came on a day when congressional allies of Mr. Trump challenged the election results from several states. Vice President Mike Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have rejected calls to overturn election results.<br />James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of  JPMorgan Chase  & Co., the country’s largest bank, said the violence doesn’t represent the U.S. “Our elected leaders have a responsibility to call for an end to the violence, accept the results, and, as our democracy has for hundreds of years, support the peaceful transition of power," Mr. Dimon said in a statement.<br />Marc Benioff, the chief executive of  Salesforce.com Inc.,  tweeted: “Our leaders must call for peace and unity now. There is no room for violence in our democracy. May the One who brings peace bring peace to our country.”</td>

      <td>The D.C. Circuit judge could bring sober leadership to Justice.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden promised to lower the temperature of America’s partisan hothouse, but some of his nominations have not lived up to that promise. One that does is his selection of Merrick Garland as Attorney General, perhaps now the most important cabinet post for domestic politics.<br />Public confidence in the Department of Justice has been severely damaged in recent years, not least the last four, as it became clear that President Trump’s partisan adversaries manipulated the FBI and Justice Department to try to handicap his Administration. Mr. Trump toward the end of his term also increasingly demanded that the Justice Department be weaponized in reverse. Attorney General Bill Barr refused and did his best to depoliticize prosecutorial decisions.<br />The Biden Administration will face pressure from the left to pursue Republicans who worked in the Trump Administration, banana-republic style, along the lines Sen. Elizabeth Warrencalled for in her presidential campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris said in 2019 she would have “no choice” but to prosecute Mr. Trump for obstruction of justice if elected President.<br />But Mr. Garland, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judge whom President Obama unsuccessfully nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016, is unlikely to have signed up for a job of political recrimination. For more than two decades he has been a mainstream center-left judge with a calm temperament and no demonstrated interest in settling scores or legal “Resistance.”<br />Mr. Garland’s experience as a prosecutor during the high-crime 1990s may help balance anti-police sentiment in the Administration. His vaunted status among Democrats, who feel he was wronged by the 2016 Republican decision not to seat him on the Supreme Court, might give him more credibility to make decisions that disappoint progressives.</td>

      <td>His relentless attacks on the state’s election apparatus likely depressed Republican turnout.</td>
      <td>The Democrats’ twin victories in Tuesday’s Georgia Senate runoffs create a political dynamic in Washington that isn’t out of line with recent precedent. Joe Biden will enter the presidency, after wresting it from the other party, with majorities for his party in both houses of Congress. Bill Clinton managed the same feat in 1993. So did George W. Bush in 2001, Barack Obama in 2009 and Donald Trump in 2017. Indeed, the Bush Republican majorities in 2001 (51-50 in the Senate and 221-213 in the House) were almost identical to the Biden Democratic majorities now (51-50 in the Senate and 222-211 in the House).<br />In no case did these majorities lead to long-term control of the federal government. Messrs. Clinton, Obama and Trump saw their parties lose one or both houses of Congress two years after taking office. In 2001, Mr. Bush’s Republicans lost their Senate majority in five months when Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords switched parties. The GOP regained its Senate majority in 2002 and 2004, in both cases picking up a seat in Georgia.<br />For nearly two decades, Georgia seemed an impenetrable Republican stronghold. The party’s candidates won every presidential, gubernatorial and senatorial race there from 2002-18. But this year, affluent voters in metro Atlanta, like their counterparts in Houston, Dallas and Phoenix, started inching away from the Republicans, as affluent voters in the Northeast, Midwest and West Coast did starting in the 1990s. An increasing black population—many moving from cities like Chicago and Detroit—has contributed to the rising Democratic tide across the South. Georgia, Texas and Arizona are now presidential target states.<br />Voters in Georgia’s cities and suburbs recoiled against Mr. Trump, for reasons of both style and substance. He lost Georgia to Mr. Biden in November by a margin of 49.5% to 49.3%, then he lost his party’s two Senate seats in the runoff.<br />Tuesday’s result wasn’t inevitable. In November Sen. David Perdue edged Democrat Jon Ossoff 49.7% to 47.9%. In the special all-party election for the vacancy created by the resignation of Sen. Johnny Isakson, Republican candidates led Democrats by an almost identical margin: 49.4% to 48.4%. But under Georgia law, Mr. Perdue’s failure to win an absolute majority put him in a runoff against Mr. Ossoff. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, appointed to replace Mr. Isakson, squared off in a head-to-head battle with the lead Democrat, the Rev. Raphael Warnock.</td>

      <td>The jailed Hong Kong democracy activist isn’t giving up.</td>
      <td>Jimmy Lai began 2021 in jail. The detention last month of the prominent Hong Kong businessman and democracy activist suggested that the Chinese Communist Party was looking to crack down on dissent. The hammer dropped Tuesday morning, with the mass arrest of 53 other democracy proponents in Hong Kong.<br />The jailings may lead to an early test for the Biden administration. While Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were celebrated as Time magazine’s “Persons of the Year” for winning an election, it is not clear if they will stand with those fighting for the right to have elections at all.<br />From a global perspective, the big story of 2020 was China’s government: its duplicity around Covid, the continuing expansion of its surveillance state, and its mass forced incarceration and indoctrination of Uighurs in 380 detention centers across the Xianjing region. China is flexing its muscles in Hong Kong unchecked. It is time the rest of the world stood up for the norms of free societies, including free speech and the rule of law.<br />Mr. Lai’s case should draw world-wide attention to what is being lost in Hong Kong. At 12, he smuggled himself out of mainland China by boat, reaching Hong Kong penniless but ambitious. Sixty years later, his success embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of a free Hong Kong; from nothing he built a clothing store empire, then a newspaper and media conglomerate. His newspaper,  Apple  Daily, is the second-most read paper in Hong Kong.<br />Those accomplishments are impressive, but what he is most passionate about, and what keeps him up at night, is Hong Kong’s democracy movement. When I interviewed him in early November, he said “I really appreciate the freedom in Hong Kong. This freedom has given us all that we have. Hope. Inspiration. This is so precious. With my gratitude to this place, it is my duty to do whatever I can to fight for freedom and the rule of law here.”</td>

      <td>The Senate is lost, the GOP is bitterly split and Trump’s actions have consequences.</td>
      <td>President Trump may have been correct at his Monday rally when he said of Georgia Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler: “If they win I’ll get no credit, and if they lose they’re going to blame Trump.” But Tuesday’s election and Wednesday’s mob assault on Congress were stark examples of the destructive reactions the president can generate.<br />One Trump effect was felt in Atlanta’s suburbs. In Clayton County in November, Democrat Jon Ossoff had a 71-point lead; on Tuesday it was 77. In DeKalb Mr. Ossoff led by 64 points in November; on Tuesday he led by 67. In Gwinnett he led by 16 points in November and 20 on Tuesday. In Fulton, the state’s most populous county, Mr. Ossoff’s November lead was 41.6 points; on Tuesday, 43 points. These were enough to erase Mr. Perdue’s 88,000 vote lead in November and propel Mr. Ossoff to a narrow victory.<br />Mr. Trump tried to turn out his rural Georgia supporters, but the results were uneven and insufficient. Take the 14th Congressional District, which the president visited Monday. In November it had roughly 328,000 voters turn out; on Tuesday only 282,000 voted there, though there are several thousand ballots still outstanding.<br />A key factor was the decision by many independents and soft Republicans to vote Democrat—largely, it appears, in response to Mr. Trump’s actions since the presidential election. These helped Democrats make the race about Mr. Trump and undermined GOP efforts to highlight the Democratic candidates’ left-wing views and present a Republican Senate as a check on Democrats in Washington.<br />Mr. Trump’s unrelenting personal attacks on Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger also drew attention away from the Senate race while igniting an intraparty civil war. That rarely leads to anything productive. It didn’t here.</td>

      <td>Most companies benefiting from the Fed’s bond buys didn’t need the cash, and didn’t spend it well either.</td>
      <td>Conservatives accuse progressives of wanting to destroy capitalism. Yet a greater threat than Bernie Sanders is the prospect of serial market bailouts by monetary authorities—first the banking system in 2008, and now the entire business world amid the pandemic. The Treasury Department and Congress have moved to curtail the Federal Reserve’s ability to prop up already bloated corporate debt markets. That’s a step in the right direction—the Fed’s corporate credit facilities should be left to die.<br />The creation of the corporate facilities last March marked the first time in history that the Fed would buy corporate debt. The plan went far beyond previous quantitative easing, in which the Fed bought up government-backed securities. The purpose of the corporate facilities was to help companies access debt markets during the pandemic, making it possible to sustain operations and keep employees on payroll. Instead, the facilities resulted in a huge and unnecessary bailout of corporate debt issuers, underwriters and bondholders.<br />The disruptions in the corporate debt market had largely dissipated by the end of March. Since that time, there has been no liquidity shortage for large companies. Corporate bond issuance in 2020 reached $2.3 trillion, exceeding the previous yearly record by more than 35%. In fact, large companies raised more money from private lenders during the difficult early months of 2020 than they raised during the same period in 2019.<br />There isn’t much evidence that all of this cash went toward creating and preserving jobs in the U.S. And the Fed did nothing to ensure that, declining to limit its corporate debt purchases to companies with significant U.S. workforces or prevent debt proceeds from being used for outsize executive compensation or shareholder distributions, even though Congress considered such limits when it approved the facilities. A House committee report found that companies benefiting from the facilities laid off more than one million workers from March to September. That includes  Boeing ,  which laid off 16,000 employees, and  Sysco ,  a food service company that laid off a third of its workforce while continuing to pay its shareholders a dividend.<br />While there’s little evidence that the Fed’s corporate debt buy-up benefited society, its costs and unintended consequences are significant, with clear damage to competitiveness and productivity.</td>

      <td>The hot new way to take companies public hurts most investors, and its track record is now clear.</td>
      <td>There’s a growing fad on Wall Street: special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Touted as a better way to take companies public, SPACs have raised more equity in 2020 than over the entire preceding decade. But please, take a minute before jumping in—our research suggests that this trend will end poorly for a large majority of investors.<br />A SPAC is a shell company that a “sponsor” investor or group organizes and takes public in an initial public offering. Once public, the company has no operations. It simply holds cash—typically, $200 million to $400 million—and has two years to find a private company with which to merge and thereby bring public. The sponsor invests some of its own capital in the SPAC as well but takes an additional 20% interest in the SPAC at a nominal price.<br />Most investment in SPAC IPOs comes from hedge funds known in the market as the “SPAC Mafia.” The sponsor’s pitch to these funds is simple: Invest in “units” containing one share and one or two additional securities—a “right” and/or a warrant. The price is $10 per unit, but if you don’t want to participate in the merger, you can redeem your shares for $10 plus interest and keep the warrants and rights for free.<br />This is a tremendous deal for IPO investors who redeem their shares. A right gives a unit holder an additional one-tenth of a SPAC share when the merger is complete. A typical warrant gives the holder an option to buy between one-half and one share at an exercise price of $11.50 any time over five years following the SPAC’s merger. On average, if an investor buys units in a SPAC public offering, redeems its shares and keeps or sells its warrants and rights, the investor’s annualized return is more than 10% with no downside risk.<br />We studied SPACs that completed mergers between January 2019 and June 2020 and found that, on average, they lost 12% of their value within six months following the merger, while the Nasdaq rose roughly 30%. Even with these drops in share price, the 20% that the sponsor gets essentially for free provides a nice return on its investment. The sponsors of these SPACs enjoyed a return on investment of more than 500% as of the end of 2020.</td>

      <td>The greatest threat to Donald Trump’s legacy is if his American presidency is seen by future historians as ending in farce and tragedy. We may be there.<br />For the last half of his Monday evening rally in Georgia for Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Mr. Trump read from the teleprompter a detailed description of the ways he believes election fraud was committed in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The two Republicans then lost.<br />On Wednesday in Washington, Mr. Trump delivered the same speech to a massive crowd, which then invaded the Capitol building, forcing the evacuation of Vice President Mike Pence and a general lockdown.<br />Political mockery is merciless, and so it was this week with the appearance of a viral video that recreates Mr. Trump making these election-fraud accusations seated at his desk in the Oval Office—“the numbers are corrupt, it was a rigged election, 100%”—as workmen remove the desk, with him attached to it, out of the office, down a White House hall and into the back of a truck, while he insists: “There’s tremendous fraud here. Wait just one second . . .”<br />That second has passed.</td>
