      <td>LIMA, Peru—Peru’s Health Ministry said Saturday it has suspended a trial for a Chinese Covid-19 vaccine after a participant presented health problems.<br />The Healthy Ministry said a trial with 12,000 volunteers for China’s  Sinopharm  vaccine has been temporarily put on hold as it investigates whether the vaccine caused what it described as a “serious adverse event” in one of the participants. The trial was expected to finish in the coming days.<br />Germán Málaga, a health researcher at the Cayetano Heredia University in Lima, where the trial is taking place, said a volunteer presented neurological problems, resulting in difficulty moving his legs. Dr. Málaga told radio station RPP Noticias that he didn’t believe the health problem was due to the vaccine, but more information was needed.<br />“We are concerned about the situation, and we are providing all of our help and support to ensure that it is cleared up,” he said.<br />The United Arab Emirates said this week that its own trial for the Sinopharm vaccine had shown that it was 86% effective in protecting people from Covid-19.</td>

While the reasons aren’t entirely clear, people familiar with the matter cited the extreme first-day pops this past week in the shares of DoorDash Inc. and Airbnb Inc. and delays at the Securities and Exchange Commission amid a flood of listing requests.<br />The move comes just a day after The Wall Street Journal reported that videogame company Roblox Corp., which was on a similar IPO timetable, put its listing on pause until early next year.<br />Roblox decided to wait because of challenges arising from the first-day jumps, according to people familiar with the offering. When shares jump like Airbnb’s and DoorDash’s did, the companies miss out on billions of dollars they might have raised and instead hand it to select investors lucky enough to get IPO allocations.<br />Roblox’s board met Friday and determined that, given those considerations, the company and its underwriters should rethink how to price the offering, one of the people said.</td>

      <td>The drug giant’s bid for rare-disease specialist Alexion should please shareholders if the company doesn’t find itself in a bidding war</td>
      <td>AstraZeneca ’s  $39 billion splurge to acquire Alexion Pharmaceuticals  looks like a winner—as long as it can hang on at that price tag.<br />The European pharmaceuticals giant said Saturday it would acquire the rare-disease specialist for $175 a share, with just over one-third of that payable in cash and the remainder in stock. AstraZeneca is paying a 45% premium to Alexion’s Friday closing price.<br />The deal has obvious benefits for both sides. AstraZeneca’s big prize in this deal is the blood disorder treatment Soliris, which generates roughly $5 billion in annual sales. That would rank right alongside the cancer drug Tagrisso as one of the company’s bestselling products. Competition for Soliris is unlikely to reach the market for several years, and rare-disease patients have historically been reluctant to switch treatments, even if a drug with superior data reaches the market.<br />Much of the public attention that AstraZeneca has received recently has surrounded its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, but it is unlikely to be a significant part of company sales for a long time. Alexion is far more material. AstraZeneca expects the deal to increase earnings per share by at least 10% over the next three years. The company also said that the acquisition “supports” its “progressive dividend policy,” signaling a higher payout eventually.<br />As for Alexion, its stock price is down 40% since its 2015 high, despite those huge cash flows. Drug companies with one product accounting for the majority of their sales tend to trade at low earnings multiples. In the case of Alexion, Soliris accounts for more than 80% of 2020 estimated revenue. Its shares fetch just 10 times this year’s adjusted profit forecast. By that logic, an asset like Soliris is more valuable to a larger, more-diversified company like AstraZeneca, in the eyes of Wall Street.</td>

      <td>Our unique ability to analyze patterns is at the root of a psychological disability and the talent that drives human development</td>
      <td>On the face of it, we shouldn’t expect any link between a neurological disability and one of the crowning talents of our species. But new research is revealing a surprising connection between autism and the uniquely human capacity for invention.<br />As the archaeological record shows, our ancestors started inventing things 70,000 to 100,000 years ago. This was when humans evolved the capacity to seek patterns—particularly to spot and experiment with the basic cause-and-effect relationship of if-and-then. With the development of this ability came the earliest examples of jewelry making (75,000 years ago) and the first bow-and-arrow (71,000 years ago). By around 44,000 years ago, we find the first evidence of counting.<br />The idea that if-and-then systemizing lies at the root of such technological invention derives from the work of George Boole, a 19th-century English logician. To get a simple idea of how it works, consider the earliest musical instrument, a flute made from the hollow bone of a bird, found in a cave in Germany and dated to about 40,000 years ago. Its maker must have thought: If I blow down this hollow bone, and I cover one hole, then I make sound A. That would be repeated with variations: If I blow down this hollow bone, and I uncover one hole, then I make sound B.<br />Proceeding this way can create something new—an invention. If we think that the new device is better than a previous one, we retain it. This same exquisite if-and-then logic underlies the engineering of any complex tool or system, from agriculture and cooking to math, medicine and music.<br />It happens that inventors and autistic people both love to repeat their observations of such patterns, over and over again, to uncover timeless laws. At Cambridge University’s Autism Research Centre, which I direct, we set out to explore this convergence. Our research found an overlap between the minds of those gifted in invention and the minds of autistic people. Both are more likely to be pattern seekers, or hyper-systemizers, strongly driven to analyze or build systems by identifying and experimenting with if-and-then patterns.</td>

      <td>Shut in at home, many of us had more time than ever to watch great TV—and there was more than enough of it, from ‘I May Destroy You’ to ‘The Queen’s Gambit.’</td>
      <td>The first show I reviewed in 2020 was the Netflix miniseries “Dracula,” which now seems like a foreshadowing too obvious even for a 19th-century potboiler. As in any adaptation of the 1897 Bram Stoker novel, vampirism was a kind of contagion; intimacy could be lethal; evil was poised to go viral; death lay in the story’s DNA. It’s probably fortunate, for both the series and the critic, that this “Dracula” preceded the explosions of the pandemic, because Covid-19 would have been perceived as lurking around every Transylvanian corner.<br />Almost everything on the small screen this year was made well before the disease was public and raging, and yet coronavirus intruded on the consciousness nonetheless. How could it not? One of the best shows of the year, the eight-part documentary epic “Lenox Hill,” portrayed the medical maelstrom inside the New York hospital of the title—before the virus hit. All one could think was “What kind of hell is it now?” (Wisely, a ninth episode, called “Pandemic,” was added by Netflix a little later.) “Transplant,” the NBC series imported from Canada, was also hospital-themed and inadvertently raised all kinds of issues in the mind of the viewer—among them, “Where’s your mask?” But even during the buoyant comedy series “Never Have I Ever,” I was thinking: Oh yeah, remember when teenagers crowded into high-school corridors and worried about crushes, first kisses, what clothes they wore and who was cool? And, BTW, when they actually went to school?<br />Divorcing oneself from current events wasn’t really possible. There just seemed to be more current events this year. And more television. Lots more. Even with a lockdown to help you out, there was no way to watch it all, or even to get one’s head around what was happening here and there among the multifarious platforms and services, from video-on-demand to the oh-so-quaint world of network television. Or with an outfit like Netflix, just for instance, delivering half-a-dozen new shows a week.<br />Presumably—and it seems a safe presumption—people were watching more television: Self-preservation required more time at home, and there often wasn’t much of an entertainment choice, given that museums, concert halls, movie theaters and clubs were shuttered. The critic’s curatorial responsibility, in turn, seemed to grow, and grow a bit confusing: If readers were watching more, what were they watching more of? And why? Was it purely to escape? Were they catching up on series they’d missed? Were they just happy to binge their way through a health-crisis tunnel with no discernible light at the end?<br />In the limited number of social situations I found myself in this year, talk invariably gravitated to television, and not just because I monopolized the conversation. People were enthusiastic about things they’d been able to discover, or rediscover, during their time at home. Knowing this, my critical calculation was to try to steer readers in the direction of shows that they’d be kicking themselves later for having missed the first time around. Shows like “The Queen’s Gambit,” which is my personal favorite drama of the year, or other first-rate fictional series that made their debuts throughout 2020—“I May Destroy You,” “The Great,” “I Know This Much Is True,” “Normal People” and the gripping “Baghdad Central.” One of the upsides of our time is that most everything can be viewed at one’s leisure, through an array of providers.</td>

Mr. Wilkie and top aides refused to fully cooperate with the probe and a top aide unsuccessfully tried to plant a story with a major newspaper discrediting the woman, investigators said in the report.<br />Investigators said they didn’t find that Mr. Wilkie actively tried to seek negative information about the woman. But they said they couldn’t resolve a number of discrepancies because of his and other VA officials’ lack of cooperation.<br />A spokeswoman for Mr. Wilkie said Saturday he will continue to lead the department. He said Thursday that he denied wrongdoing and the investigation was unfounded.</td>

      <td>Dividend-paying stocks haven’t been superstars lately and in theory they shouldn’t be, but companies that pay them could shine once more</td>
      <td>What do you call an investment strategy that would have left the likes of  Amazon ,   Facebook ,   Tesla ,   Netflix  and Google parent  Alphabet  out of your portfolio?<br />Aside from some unprintable words, “stodgy” might come to mind. But until recently, a portfolio that mechanically excluded such nonpayers of dividends would have done very well. They might again in practice, even if they shouldn’t in theory.<br />Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, pioneers of modern financial theory, argued decades ago that investors should in theory be largely indifferent to dividends. Since the 1980s, the payouts have become quaint in the U.S. as companies have been able to freely buy back their shares. In the second quarter of this year, the yield from buybacks in the S&P 500 was 2.52% whereas the dividend yield was just 1.75%, according to Yardeni Research.<br />The decision to pay out cash comes down to how much money investors think management can earn if they keep it. Activist investors have split on the issue recently with D.E. Shaw pushing  Exxon Mobil  to cut expenditures to maintain its fat dividend and Third Point asking Walt  Disney  to suspend its payout and invest in streaming instead.<br />Yet for something that theoretically shouldn’t matter, dividend-paying stocks have done swimmingly. The key seems to be focusing on those with high but sustainable payouts. Slicing large U.S. companies into quintiles by dividend yield found that the second-highest-yielding group beat the market most consistently each year over many decades. Measured from 1928 through 2019, a basket of dividend payers in that quintile saw a $1 investment turn into $25,395, according to Dartmouth College professor Kenneth French. A basket of nonpayers would have been worth just $2,139.</td>

The border had reopened only 48 hours earlier, after closing at the outset of the pandemic. This was one of the first flights to make the trip.<br />Passengers were told they would either have to pay for a return flight to South Australia or commit to a 14-day quarantine on arrival in the city of Perth.<br />Health officials and lawmakers in Australia say they are convinced that the country’s success in suppressing the coronavirus owes much to a series of border controls that are among the strictest in the Western world, although it has come at a cost to businesses.<br />Now, as Australia and other governments prepare to roll out vaccines and reopen their economies, deciding when to let people travel freely is proving difficult.</td>

The vaccine is being reviewed by U.K. and European medicines regulators, and could be authorized for emergency use in the U.K. within weeks, scientists involved in it have said.<br />The company has embarked on one of the most ambitious efforts to manufacture and distribute the vaccine among a handful of Western pharmaceutical giants, assuming it gets the green light for its shot. With the Alexion deal, it is now also pursuing one of the biggest drug industry deals of the year.<br />AstraZeneca said Alexion will give it a greater scientific presence in immunology, with a rare-disease unit based in Boston. Directors of both companies have approved the acquisition, which they expect to close in the third quarter of 2021.<br />AstraZeneca has reinvented itself in recent years as a cancer-drug powerhouse.

      <td>The indefatigable mogul describes her approach to beauty, wellness, social media and aging. She’s a fan of CBD products and ring lights.</td>
      <td>IN NEARLY 30 years of appearing on television and lending her name and expertise to 97 books, a magazine, Christmas trees, crafting supplies, dog beds and CBD gummies, Martha Stewart, 79, has always been the face of her ventures. But during our collective quarantine, her already significant use of social media as a personal branding tool grew. Her long-standing interest in wellness, skincare and beauty became newly relevant as she connected with millions of followers, many of them a fraction of her age. She invested in more sophisticated lighting for her Zoom calls; she lost some weight; she posted a viral selfie at the edge of her East Hampton swimming pool (after learning the term, she admitted that the alluring picture was a “thirst trap,” or purposefully enticing post). For a woman approaching her ninth decade, when CEOs of all genders typically shrink back, she is placing her own image front and center.<br />“When you are the face of the brand there are a lot of obligations to look good at all times,” said Ms. Stewart when we spoke last week.<br />That’s especially true in the Instagram era, with its nonstop narrative potential—and scrutiny. “A picture [on social media] tells a big story and generally those pictures can be zoomed in on, so people are zooming in on the tiniest details,” said Ms. Stewart. “They’re zooming in on your pores of your face, and they’re zooming in on your teeth and your ears and your hair, and it’s never been like that before. Once there was a picture in a magazine and you looked great, and they couldn’t zoom in on anything.”<br />With her fans zooming in on her photos and livestreams as well as watching her on multiple high-definition TV shows, (“Martha Knows Best,” “Chopped” and “Clipped,” an upcoming topiary series) her regime is more important than ever. In addition to a conscientious skincare routine which typically begins with a 4 a.m. face mask, she says she’s been eating healthily and spending time horseback riding during quarantine. Facials, haircuts and color and manicures have all resumed cautiously after a long pandemic break. Every morning she drinks a green juice made in her Breville juicer (ingredients: celery, parsley leaves, spinach, cucumbers, ginger, pineapple, the skin and the pulp of a half of an orange or a grapefruit, and sometimes persimmon, mint, carrot or pear).<br />On most mornings when she is shooting, her makeup artist Nicole Daisy Toye, 39, will drive the hour-plus out to Westchester from New York City to do her makeup. Ms. Toye has been doing Ms. Stewart’s makeup for 10 years, and they’ve traveled extensively together (her mother wrote the mogul a letter thanking her for showing her daughter the world). Now that Ms. Stewart has shared her limelight with Ms. Toye on social media, the makeup artist is bombarded with questions from women about how to get the Martha look. Ms. Toye repeats the basics constantly: take care of your skin, wear sunscreen, invest in a good foundation, a bronzer and a blush. If there’s a secret sauce, it’s getting serious about lighting: Ms. Toye and Ms. Stewart buy their ring lights and Light & Motion LED lights from professional photo equipment store B&H.</td>

      <td>New York<br />Visitors to “Working Together: The Photographers of the Kamoinge Workshop” at the Whitney Museum of American Art are likely to have two immediate reactions.<br />The first will be to wonder why this group of African-American photographers is not better known. What took so long for major museums to take note of their contributions?<br />A second reaction should then override the first. Walking through the galleries on the eighth floor, which feature some 140 black-and-white photographs and relevant ephemera by 14 artists, people may begin to forget that most of the names are unfamiliar and instead bask in the sheer luminosity of the prints. This was a group of men (and one woman) that cared deeply about exploring the nuances and depths possible with monochrome film and paper. (If you can’t see the show in person, the Whitney has a digital feature on its website where visitors can see nearly all of the photos in the show and learn more about each artist.)<br />“Kamoinge” is a word borrowed from the Kikuyu language of Kenya and translates as “a group of people acting and working together.” The photographer and teacher Louis Draper (1935-2002) chose the name in 1963 when he founded the collective in New York. He had studied with the leading photojournalist of the day, W. Eugene Smith, and wanted to portray Black communities with the same emotional scope found in the work of Smith, Gordon Parks and Roy DeCarava brought to their subjects.</td>

Both companies said the mouthwashes dissolve the outer protective layer of virus particles, preventing them from attaching to cells and infecting them.<br />But based on tests so far they can’t definitively say how long the benefit would last or what impact coughing would have. That makes it hard to judge how useful oral-hygiene products could be in curbing transmission.</td>

The upgrade, which the company calls interactive teaching, could represent a significant advance in the way AI-powered voice assistants interpret and learn from everyday conversation, experts say.<br />Interactive teaching is powered by deep-learning models, and it works by having Alexa ask questions about a task-relevant phrase it is encountering for the first time.<br />For instance, if a user asks Alexa to set the lights to “reading mode” and the device hasn’t heard that phrase before, it will ask what it means. If the user says it means to set the lights at 50% brightness, Alexa will remember that for the next time.<br />Before this, teaching Alexa new terms required manual steps, such as having engineers program updates, or having users type in verbal triggers for actions in the Alexa app.<br />But with the new capability, Alexa is able to recognize gaps in its understanding and initiate the learning process, said Rohit Prasad, vice president and head scientist for Alexa AI at Amazon. The upgrade is available  in all U.S. Alexa devices.</td>

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has banned outdoor patios in most areas too. Mr. Cuomo said Friday that he’s shutting down indoor dining in New York City as of Monday.<br />According to state contact tracing data, restaurants and bars account for 1.4% of the virus spread in the state while household gatherings make up nearly 74%. That’s not surprising. In New York City, restaurants were limited to 25% capacity. Who limits capacity in their living rooms during football watch parties or Thanksgiving?<br />Restaurants and other small businesses have spent heavily to comply with government Covid regulations, including buying personal protective equipment for staff and improved ventilation systems. But now they are being punished because, well, government can’t control the virus and Democratic leaders feel they must appear to be doing something.<br />Democratic governors probably expect Congress to pass a Covid relief bill with more aid for small businesses. But this won’t cover all their rent, utilities and other overhead. The National Restaurant Association this week said 110,000 restaurants have permanently shuttered in 2020, notwithstanding forgivable government loans.</td>

Mr. Ellison is known for his lavish homes in the region.<br />Oracle, which was founded in Santa Clara, Calif., in 1977, most recently had its headquarters up the road in Redwood City.

Palantir Technologies Inc.,  founded in the Bay Area in 2003, moved its headquarters to Denver this year.

The Trump Administration is speaking up, and let’s hope the Biden crowd does too.<br />Hong Kong police said Friday that Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy publisher who has written for these pages, has been charged under a new national security law. Police said Mr. Lai had colluded with foreign forces without providing any details. His real offense is that he has criticized the Beijing government and endorsed foreign sanctions for its assault on the autonomy China promised Hong Kong in its treaty with the U.K.<br />Any dissent now is a crime in the city. The national security law allows a defendant to be tried in secret or transported to Chinese courts and jail. The political pressure from Beijing will be enormous on Hong Kong’s courts, which are supposed to be independent, to convict Mr. Lai. A bail hearing was scheduled for Saturday for Mr. Lai, who is 72 years old.<br />Meanwhile, the Journal reports that Hong Kong democratic activist Sixtus Leung is seeking asylum in the U.S. Mr. Leung, who is 34, was elected to the city’s legislature in 2016 but was disqualified after a ruling from Beijing. He has advocated self-determination for Hong Kong, which would also put him on Beijing’s target list for violating the national security law.<br />Bloomberg News reports that Chinese security officials have also detained Haze Fan, a Chinese staffer in Beijing, without explanation. Most foreign publications operating in China employ expatriates and Chinese nationals. Chinese citizens are especially vulnerable, and the arrest could be intended to intimidate other Chinese to stop working for Western publications.</td>

      <td>An Obama-era solar failure could cost taxpayers $510 million.</td>
      <td>Move over, Solyndra. Another green boondoggle from the Obama era has failed, and taxpayers are out as much as $510 million. Late last week Judge Karen Owens approved a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization by Tonopah Solar Energy. Tonopah operated the Crescent Dunes solar plant in Nevada that received $737 million in guaranteed loans from the Obama Administration.<br />The plan includes a settlement with the Department of Energy that leaves taxpayers liable for as much as $234.68 million in outstanding debt, but the total public cost is even higher. Crescent Dunes also received an investment-tax credit, and the 2009 stimulus legislation allowed it to receive a cash payment in lieu of credit. In 2017 the plant received more than $275.6 million from Treasury under the Section 1603 program, which it used to service its outstanding liabilities. So taxpayers already gave Crescent Dunes cash to pay off its taxpayer-backed loans.<br />This is one more cautionary tale in climate subsidies. The sun doesn’t deliver power when it’s cloudy or dark. Crescent Dunes promised to solve this problem by using molten salt to retain the heat from the sun and produce steam, so the plant would generate power 24/7.<br />But Crescent Dunes struggled to get financing from commercial lenders—not least because it was “the first of its kind in the United States and the tallest molten salt tower in the world,” as the Department of Energy gushed in a September 2011 news release.<br />Uncle Sam still rushed in, and the problems soon began. Because of construction delays, Crescent Dunes missed its deadline to begin commercial operations. Equipment failures meant the plant generated no energy through the first half of 2017. Outages were so frequent that the sole buyer of its power, the utility NV Energy, told regulators that Crescent Dunes posed “the most significant risk” to its ability to meet its renewable portfolio goals.</td>

      <td>An new state effort to overturn a law banning race preferences.</td>
      <td>No matter how many times voters reject racial preferences in law, the advocates won’t stop trying to fool the public with another tricky rewrite. The latest example comes from Washington state, where voters defeated an effort to overturn a ban on race preferences in 2019. Now there’s a new initiative, I-1300, which may be the most deceptive.<br />The disguise begins with its name, the Manuel Ellis Washington Anti-Discrimination Act. Ellis was a black man who died in March while being arrested by Tacoma police in what the Pierce County medical examiner says was a homicide. I-1300 would ban police chokeholds and other uses of force it considers excessive.<br />If that’s all it did, the use of Ellis’s name would be understandable. But the initiative also rewrites state law to overturn the state’s ban on race preferences for public contracting, public employment and admissions to public colleges. It buries this in 22 pages whose topics range from breastfeeding in public and free Covid-19 vaccinations to Donald Trump’s refusal “to denounce white supremacists during the first nationally televised presidential debate with former vice president Joe Biden.”<br />The operative language doesn’t come until Part VII, 16 pages in, where it redefines “preferential treatment.” Current law says the “state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, or national origin.” The new language forbids preferential treatment only when it is solely based on these categories.<br />The addition of “solely” is a giant loophole because it sets no real limits. It is the same loophole Harvard and other schools cite to justify their own discrimination in admissions, arguing that race is merely one of many considerations.</td>

Excitement revved up over the summer and fizzled, only to start again last month when S&P initially unveiled its plan to add the electric-car maker to the index. The final piece of the puzzle was which stock would be removed.<br />Tesla shares have skyrocketed this year, up more than 600%, with much of those gains coming in the past month. Individual investors and fund managers who actively buy stocks pounced on the news that the stock would join the index, anticipating a surge in demand that would push Tesla shares even higher. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts initially said such activity would push Tesla shares up to $600 by the inclusion date. But shares have already blown past that estimate, closing Friday at nearly $610.<br />Changes to the index are usually a mundane affair. But in the case of Tesla, the switch isn’t as simple as buying one stock and selling another for the fund managers who track the index.</td>

Mr. Nolan is the director behind three Batman blockbusters, “Inception,” “Dunkirk” and several other movies you’ve heard of. And yet he probably never thrilled any audience as much he did movie-industry insiders this week with his denunciation of Warner Bros. and its corporate parent,  AT&T .<br />Citing the pandemic, Warner announced that its full slate of 2021 releases would appear on its affiliated HBO Max streaming service on the same day as theaters. Warner did not say this would become routine. Much of Hollywood’s output in recent years has been destined for streaming rather than theatrical release. But such considerations did not hinder the colorful declarations of Mr. Nolan. Previously known for pledging that he would never do business with  Netflix ,  he was quoted everywhere saying the once-storied Warner Bros. studio had soiled its relation with talent and that its decision “makes no economic sense.”<br />Actually, it makes plenty of sense. Hollywood is a business. If theater owners could make it worth Warner’s while to debut its movies exclusively in theaters, Warner would happily do so.<br />In fact, much of the noise is routine posturing in advance of predictable negotiations. Many parties, including actors and directors, will need to be compensated for box-office shares they originally expected to receive from the movies playing on big screens. Still, the studio is not obliged to compensate them for sales lost to the pandemic, only for sales lost to HBO Max, which is found in less than a third of America’s homes and has little overseas distribution, where much of Hollywood’s ticket revenue nowadays is generated.<br />The end of the world this isn’t. Movie professionals might even start to appreciate a new term, “churn.” Instead of fussing over changes to the distribution model that were coming anyway, the Hollywood talent pool ought to see this as yet another pile of money to drive up fees, salaries and payouts to the talent pool.</td>

      <td>Jill Biden should think about dropping the honorific, which feels fraudulent, even comic.</td>
      <td>Madame First Lady—Mrs. Biden—Jill—kiddo: a bit of advice on what may seem like a small but I think is a not unimportant matter. Any chance you might drop the “Dr.” before your name? “Dr. Jill Biden” sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic. Your degree is, I believe, an Ed.D., a doctor of education, earned at the University of Delaware through a dissertation with the unpromising title “Student Retention at the Community College Level: Meeting Students’ Needs.” A wise man once said that no one should call himself “Dr.” unless he has delivered a child. Think about it, Dr. Jill, and forthwith drop the doc.<br />I taught at Northwestern University for 30 years without a doctorate or any advanced degree. I have only a B.A. in absentia from the University of Chicago—in absentia because I took my final examination on a pool table at Headquarters Company, Fort Hood, Texas, while serving in the peacetime Army in the late 1950s. I do have an honorary doctorate, though I have to report that the president of the school that awarded it was fired the year after I received it, not, I hope, for allowing my honorary doctorate. During my years as a university teacher I was sometimes addressed, usually on the phone, as “Dr. Epstein.” On such occasions it was all I could do not to reply, “Read two chapters of Henry James and get into bed. I’ll be right over.”<br />I was also often addressed as Dr. during the years I was editor of the American Scholar, the quarterly magazine of Phi Beta Kappa. Let me quickly insert that I am also not a member of Phi Beta Kappa, except by marriage. Many of those who so addressed me, I noted, were scientists. I also received a fair amount of correspondence from people who appended the initials Ph.D. to their names atop their letterheads, and have twice seen PHD on vanity license plates, which struck me as pathetic. In contemporary universities, in the social sciences and humanities, calling oneself Dr. is thought bush league.<br />The Ph.D. may once have held prestige, but that has been diminished by the erosion of seriousness and the relaxation of standards in university education generally, at any rate outside the sciences. Getting a doctorate was then an arduous proceeding: One had to pass examinations in two foreign languages, one of them Greek or Latin, defend one’s thesis, and take an oral examination on general knowledge in one’s field. At Columbia University of an earlier day, a secretary sat outside the room where these examinations were administered, a pitcher of water and a glass on her desk. The water and glass were there for the candidates who fainted. A far cry, this, from the few doctoral examinations I sat in on during my teaching days, where candidates and teachers addressed one another by first names and the general atmosphere more resembled a kaffeeklatsch. Dr. Jill, I note you acquired your Ed.D. as recently as 15 years ago at age 55, or long after the terror had departed.<br />The prestige of honorary doctorates has declined even further. Such degrees were once given exclusively to scholars, statesmen, artists and scientists. Then rich men entered the lists, usually in the hope that they would donate money to the schools that had granted them their honorary degrees. (My late friend Sol Linowitz, then chairman of Xerox, told me that he had 63 honorary doctorates.) Famous television journalists, who passed themselves off as intelligent, followed. Entertainers, who didn’t bother feigning intelligence, were next.</td>

      <td>Defunct coal company Blackjewel LLC, which left hundreds out-of-work when the business collapsed last year, has filed a lawsuit accusing its founder and former chief executive of using his position to enrich himself and his family members at the company’s expense.<br />Jeff Hoops Sr., who resigned as CEO days after the coal producer filed chapter 11 last July, signed deals with other companies he or his family controlled that extracted millions of dollars from Blackjewel in the years leading up to the bankruptcy, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of W.Va., by lawyers who are liquidating the company.<br />The lawsuit seeks to recover money from Mr. Hoops and his other businesses for what Blackjewel said were transactions that placed his financial interests above the company he founded and led until its failure.<br />A lawyer for Mr. Hoops didn’t respond to requests for comment. Mr. Hoops has previously denied allegations that he used Blackjewel for his benefit, testifying in bankruptcy court last year that “my interest is always in the best interest of Blackjewel and never in my personal interest.”<br />Blackjewel’s investigation of Mr. Hoops is one of the open-issues remaining in the company’s bankruptcy, which attracted national attention and scrutiny from the U.S. Labor Department after laid-off workers in Cumberland, Ky., spent weeks blocking a shipment of coal in protest of not receiving their final paychecks. Ultimately, the business receiving the coal shipment agreed to pay more than $5 million to cover the workers’ back pay.</td>

      <td>Can a group portrait of modern tyrants tell us how to  prevent their outrages?</td>
      <td>In the very first sentence of “Strongmen,” its author, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, declares that her book “reflects a lifetime of thinking about authoritarian rulers.” This revelation of an extensive personal timeline of toil—a lifetime, no less—places a burden on Ms. Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University. Many readers—and not just the most exacting among them—are likely to say to themselves: “This book had better be good.”<br />Alas, misgivings surface at the outset, when Ms. Ben-Ghiat provides a list of her “protagonists.” They span from “Mussolini to the Present” (as the book’s subtitle states) and include, apart from Il Duce (about whom Ms. Ben-Ghiat has written elegantly in her previous books) such stalwarts of the strongman species as Hitler, Franco, Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein and Vladimir Putin. Many will take delight in the fact, which others will find irksome, that Donald Trump is also on her list, whose members number 17 in all. Of these, only three—Somalia’s onetime dictator Siad Barre, Gaddafi and Saddam—are not of the political right. And of those three, only Barre might be called a straightforward leftist. Gaddafi professed a “revolutionary” ideology never before known to man; and Saddam, an ostensibly pan-Arab Baathist, reposed greater faith in terror than in dogma.<br />So where—you might ask—are Xi Jinping, Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez? Or Lenin, Stalin and Mao? Where on earth are the Korean Kims? Certainly not in Ms. Ben-Ghiat’s book, except mentioned in passing. She offers a blithe but unconvincing explanation for the omission of the Communist ilk: “To illuminate the entire arc of authoritarian rule,” she writes, “starting with how democracies are degraded or destroyed, I do not include Communist leaders like Xi who take power in an already-closed system.” Try telling the Turkic Muslim Uighurs or the Tibetans that Mr. Xi is not a strongman because he is the product of an established process.<br />Even by Ms. Ben-Ghiat’s litmus test—that of an “already-closed system”—the exclusion of Castro and Chavez is baffling. Both men established communism and “Bolivarian” socialism from scratch in their respective countries. There was no such system before them in Cuba and Venezuela. They are unlike Mussolini or Franco, say, only in the specific credo they espouse.<br />If wobbly in its analytical structure, Ms. Ben-Ghiat’s book is rich in anecdote. Mobutu Sese Seko, the strongman of Zaire/Congo, kept as his mistress the twin sister of his own wife. Gaddafi had a “sex dungeon” at the University of Tripoli for “instant gratification” with female students brought to him (against their will) by aides. Augusto Pinochet frequently spent time with female journalists who, in the words of a former Chilean minister, “came to interview him, but never published anything.” One of Saddam’s sons raped the daughter of his father’s favorite mistress. Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi reportedly described Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, as an “unf—able lardass” in a phone conversation he was having as she stood within earshot. In another incident, which Ms. Ben-Ghiat regards as “misogynist,” Mr. Putin unleashed his dog near Ms. Merkel to trigger her well-known fear of canines.</td>

      <td>How the Prussian explorer, naturalist and polymath taught America about itself.</td>
      <td>The history seems barely credible. A Prussian aristocrat, born in 1769, works for five years as a mine inspector. After his mother’s death, he uses a good chunk of the family fortune on a five-year expedition through the primeval forests and uncharted waterways of South America and Mexico. On his way home, in 1804, he spends a scant six weeks in the United States. But by virtue of his American contacts, his German and French writing, his research and his generosity of spirit, Alexander von Humboldt inspires a century of American writers, artists, explorers and scientists, championing America’s exceptionalism while also assessing its flaws.<br />The American landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church, for example, embarked on an expedition that followed in Humboldt’s footsteps; he also hung Humboldt’s portrait in his home above the Hudson River. Ralph Waldo Emerson called Humboldt “one of those wonders of the world . . . who appear from time to time, as if to show us the possibilities of the human mind.” Emerson introduced Humboldt’s writings to Thoreau, who was haunted by them. The inventor (and painter) Samuel F.B. Morse, along with Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper, made pilgrimages to visit Humboldt. On the centenary of his birth, in 1869, 25,000 people gathered in New York’s Central Park to hear speakers sing his praises and see a bust unveiled. He never returned to the U.S. but his name is attached to counties, towns and parks across the country.<br />How did such a figure become central to 19th-century American art, culture and science? Why was he then nearly forgotten in the English-speaking world? What brings him to our attention now? This confluence of phenomena, personalities, ideas and history is the subject of this grandly executed, profusely illustrated volume by Eleanor Jones Harvey, senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, based on a major exhibition.<br />Unfortunately the exhibition has now fallen victim to the coronavirus, though its cancellation doesn’t consign it to oblivion, thanks to this catalog. When I saw the show before the latest shutdown, it impressed with its range, majesty, seriousness and political significance. It included the first American appearance in 170 years of an enormous mastodon skeleton excavated in 1801 in Orange County, N.Y., by Charles Willson Peale, which took on symbolic importance for the new nation and its president, Thomas Jefferson, and was mounted in Peale’s museum (the nation’s first). This “mammoth,” now in a German collection, was hailed as a reproof to European naturalists who believed the New World offered only corrupted, weakened versions of the Old.<br />There was also a copy of Humboldt’s stupefyingly detailed map of New Spain, illustrating territory from Mexico northward, which gave Jefferson invaluable information about the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase and the boundaries to be negotiated with Spain. Frederic Church’s magnificently scaled “Niagara” (1857) was mounted along with some of his South American landscapes, creating an imagistic conversation with Humboldt’s sketches of the same scenes. On one wall were some of George Catlin’s classic oil portraits of American Indians from the 1830s and ’40s; so important was Humboldt’s friendship that Catlin’s published account of his own travels was embossed with an image of Humboldt greeting an American Iowa. And then there were reminders that the Smithsonian Institution itself was partly inspired by—and associated with—Humboldt and his ideas.</td>

      <td>Unsentimental looks at human adaptation and the life of a mother polar bear in a changing Arctic.</td>
      <td>Ibegan reading “Ice Walker” with trepidation. How could this story, whose main character is a female polar bear, avoid anthropomorphism and sentimentality? Would it devolve into a rant about melting ice and habitat destruction?<br />I need not have worried. Within a few pages I was hooked on a fascinating exploration of ice and snow, seen from the perspective of an apex predator peculiarly adapted to one of the world’s harshest environments. In deceptively simple prose, poetic yet precise, James Raffan invites us into the world of Nanu—short for Nanurjuk, which means “the bear-spirited one” in Inuktitut—as she hunts for seal on Hudson Bay in Canada’s Arctic.<br />The story begins on a frigid day in February, when Nanu is 7 years old and weighs 500 pounds. It is minus-37 degrees Celsius (or minus-35 degrees Fahrenheit) on the vast expanse of ice; at this temperature, we are told, human flesh freezes within minutes. Yet the blood running through the veins and arteries of Nanu’s massive paws remains around plus-37 degrees Celsius. Her feet are not only adapted to the temperature difference, they also leave signals, through her skin glands, to potential mates, announcing that Nanu “is healthy and coming into season.” The drama begins.<br />The ice is “talkative” at this time of year, Mr. Raffan tells us, grinding and crackling, moved by winds and currents. Nanu can feel the vibrations of the ice through those amazing feet and hear them with her ears. These senses also help Nanu hunt for prey, but when it comes to tracking seals nothing beats her extraordinary sense of smell.<br />At a seal’s breathing hole, Nanu quiets her breath, coils back onto her haunches and waits, completely still. “And then, in an explosion of energy, cold air, and flying snow, she rises up and crashes down, punching through the new snow and the crusted dome of the lair onto the unsuspecting adult seal.” Soon she is gulping down mouthfuls of the blubber she needs to sustain herself for the next year, as she births and rears cubs.</td>

      <td>Joseph Simons, who doesn’t seek limelight, previously rebuffed Trump over alleged suppression of conservative speech on tech platforms</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Joseph Simons has navigated an agitated White House, criticism from Congress and colleagues who are difficult to wrangle since becoming chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. The filing of the FTC’s antitrust lawsuit against  Facebook Inc.,  though, was a career-defining act.<br />Not that he wants any of the attention.<br />When the FTC and 46 states unveiled their tandem lawsuits against Facebook Wednesday afternoon, the commission held no press conference, and Mr. Simons said nothing at all. Instead, the FTC posted online a pre-recorded two-minute video by one of Mr. Simons’ deputies, who, with two model sailboats in the background, announced the case from his home.<br />The FTC lawsuit alleges Facebook engaged in an anticompetitive campaign to buy up and shut out rivals. The company rejects the claims as revisionist history and is preparing to battle the FTC in court. The case came on a 3-2 vote, with Mr. Simons, a Republican, joining two Democratic commissioners in the majority. The FTC’s other two GOP members voted no.<br />Mr. Simons, 62 years old, “is not flamboyant. He doesn’t stand up and claim credit. He did not take this job in order to get another job,” said George Washington University law professor William Kovacic, a former FTC chairman who previously worked with Mr. Simons at the commission. “I think he’s done a brilliant job in the hardest possible circumstances.”</td>

      <td>What Brit Bennett, Douglas Stuart, Rahm Emanuel, Kim Cattrall and others read this year</td>
      <td>Each year we ask more than 50 leaders and luminaries from literature, business, politics and the arts to name the best books they’ve read during the year. You could spend all day reading the full list—and all year reading the books.<br />The best part about rereading Chekhov at a moment of national crisis, as I did this year with “Lady With Lapdog and Other Stories,” was to be reminded that the best authors see the world not as it wants to be seen, but as it is. So often fiction diminishes that which is baffling about human behavior down to that which is logical in the confines of a story. Chekhov’s great talent was to reflect people as they are, even when they don’t make sense. The better author knows a hopeful lie often masks a more painful truth. This is probably why I was so deeply affected this year by Isabel Wilkerson’s towering, gorgeous “Caste,” which seeks to explain the hidden and complex system of inequalities at the foundation of American life. It’s this clear-eyed reporting on the truth of America rapt by its prevarications (among which one might now list equality and even democracy itself) that was so refreshing and powerful. And though we seem to be at a moment of change, the painful truth may be that we are more like the lovers in that beguiling final paragraph of “Lady With Lapdog” who realize they have still “a long, long road before them, and that the most complicated and difficult part of it was only just beginning.”<br />— Mr. Jollett is the author of the bestselling memoir “Hollywood Park.”<br /><br />I’ve been reading a lot about women artists this year, so I loved “Actress” by Anne Enright and “Feast Your Eyes” by Myla Goldberg. “Actress” follows an Irish theater legend who leaves behind a messy legacy after she commits an act of violence. “Feast Your Eyes” is centered on a midcentury photographer who takes a controversial picture of her daughter, and the daughter who tells the story of her late mother’s life. Both novels center on mother-daughter relationships complicated, in part, by the pressures of artistic ambition. And both books are about daughters reclaiming the artistic legacies of their brilliant but derided mothers. I also loved “The Glass Hotel” by Emily St. John Mandel, which was the first novel I was able to finish when the lockdown began in the spring. It’s a propulsive story about a Ponzi scheme that weaves in and out of the lives of the scammer, his co-conspirators and his victims.</td>

Now let’s look at how Robinhood may encourage risky behaviors that could backfire.<br />Consider some exchange-traded funds. Leveraged ETFs magnify the daily return of a market index, typically doubling or tripling it. Inverse ETFs deliver the opposite of a market’s one-day return, often amplifying that gain or loss with leverage. Volatility ETFs are a pure play on the short-term fluctuations of stocks or other assets.<br />Such funds are fireballs that can heat up a portfolio—or scorch it. ProShares UltraPro QQQ, or TQQQ, seeks to deliver three times the daily return of the Nasdaq-100 index. It gained 35% in November. During the February-March market panic, it lost 70%.<br />The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, which oversees brokerage firms, has warned these ETFs “typically are unsuitable for retail investors who plan to hold them for longer than one trading session.”</td>

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s office didn’t respond to questions about why it decided to join the suit now.<br />Mr. Becerra’s move could help placate Republican critics as he seeks confirmation next year as President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.</td>

The confidence level in America’s election process has fallen to the level of confidence the electorate has in Congress—dangerous for a form of democratic governance.<br />James Bullard<br />Brighton, Mich.<br /><br />In my little, 80-home neighborhood, the roll of registered voters shows at least five homes with two sets of families, reflecting both the previous and current owners. An additional two people who have died are on the roll. And several young adults who have moved away from their parents’ home are still on the roll. If they had been automatically mailed ballots, more than 10% of homes would have received extra ballots. This is the reality in a state that actually maintains the voter rolls, in a stable neighborhood of mostly middle-aged adults. Imagine what the rate is in, say, an apartment complex.</td>

Much of the media coverage on the “Schedule F classification” has bordered on the hysterical—claims of “massive government purges” and other easily dismissed boogeymen. Only in D.C. is it this controversial to suggest that federal employees be held accountable for the quality of work they perform.<br />For decades administrations have failed to achieve meaningful civil service reform. Federal employees themselves complain that it is far too difficult to get rid of poor performers. President Trump has found a way to maintain the institutional knowledge and expertise of career professionals who serve permanently and inject accountability for those closest to setting policy.<br />Most people in America serve at the will of their employer and learn to “provide objective and informed advice” while being committed to the organization’s success. This isn’t an unreasonable or outrageous request of federal employees.<br />OMB’s work won’t change: Hard questions will be asked, analysis provided and institutional memory maintained. But the men and women of OMB are not a priestly caste set apart; rather, we are the tip of the spear for implementing a president’s agenda. And that is why OMB must lead in executing this important reform.</td>

      <td>Qualcomm and other chip makers’ shares drop on latest report of Apple’s modem efforts</td>
      <td>Chip makers supplying  Apple  should have learned by now to always consider that business temporary. That doesn’t mean it’s worthless.<br />Intel is only the most recent example, finally losing its place in some of the Mac computer lineup to in-house central processors developed by Apple.  Qualcomm  might be next on the chopping block. Apple’s senior vice president of hardware technologies, Johny Srouji, told employees in a company town hall Thursday that Apple is working on its own modem chips, according to a report by Bloomberg. Modem chips are Qualcomm’s largest business with Apple, with the two companies having recently re-established their relationship following a bitter, multiyear legal dispute.<br />The news took down Qualcomm’s share price by 7.4% Friday. It also seemed to hang over other prominent Apple suppliers such as  Broadcom ,   Qorvo  and  Skyworks Solutions .  All supply radio frequency, or RF, components used in the iPhone. Broadcom shares were down 1% in morning trading despite the company having reported strong results for its fiscal fourth quarter late Thursday. Atif Malik of Citi predicted that Apple would likely look to in-source RF chips after it develops its own modem, given how tightly those components have to work together.<br />But even for Qualcomm, the pain of being replaced by Apple is still some way off—if it happens at all. Mr. Srouji said Apple’s modem effort just kicked off this year, and he described it as a “long-term strategic investment.” The settlement the two companies struck last year included a six-year licensing deal and a “multiyear” chip-supply agreement. Qualcomm’s strong lead in 5G technology was a key factor in driving that settlement, and it isn’t an area in which even Apple will be able to catch up quickly. Tim Arcuri of  UBS  noted Friday that “broad proliferation of a captive modem” on Apple’s part would likely require more expertise in radio-frequency technology that the company may have to acquire through M&A.<br />Apple is ambitious and has deep pockets, along with a well-known desire to control as much of its key technology as it can. That is a risk hanging over any chip company doing business with the tech giant. But those efforts don’t happen overnight: It took Apple a decade to field a competitive PC chip after building its first in-house central processors for the iPhone. That leaves a lot of business that can be done in the meantime, and chip makers who keep their technology well ahead of the pack can maintain their position even longer.</td>

      <td>Out-of-state groups drop millions in support of a job-killing ballot measure to soak small businesses.</td>
      <td>Phoenix<br />Much of the dust has settled from the 2020 election, but in Arizona one legal battle is just beginning. It’s a fight over the largest tax increase in the state’s history, and it’s a cautionary tale for the rest of the country—or at least for those who care about protecting their states from an onslaught of job-killing progressive policies.<br />That fight centers on Proposition 208, a ballot initiative that imposes a billion-dollar tax hike. It nearly doubles the income taxes imposed on small businesses and individuals making more than $250,000 a year, raising the marginal rate from 4.5% to 8%, with the funds supposedly going to education (though there’s no guarantee that will actually happen). What is certain is that the tax will have disastrous economic consequences, including the loss of more than 100,000 jobs and a significant drop in revenue to local and state coffers, according to a study published by the Goldwater Institute.<br />Late last month, a coalition of legislators, taxpayers, and small-business groups filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 208. The Arizona Constitution clearly limits how the state can raise and spend money on education. Proposition 208 attempts to evade those limits.<br />Proponents of Proposition 208 could have asked Arizonans to amend the Constitution. They had plenty of time to collect the necessary signatures to get such a question on the ballot. Instead they decided to put their tax increase proposal before voters as ordinary legislation. They did so even after warnings about the measure’s constitutionality, including from the nonpartisan Legislative Council. Because Proposition 208 was passed as a statute rather than a constitutional amendment, it can’t override the Arizona Constitution. Proposition 208 also attempts to invade the Legislature’s ability to pass a budget and allocate funding for everything from higher education and public safety to government responses to the coronavirus pandemic.</td>

      <td>Andrew Colborn says  Netflix  ruined his life. As a sheriff’s sergeant, he helped convict a murderer in 2007. Eight years later, the streaming service debuted a documentary series suggesting Mr. Colborn and his law-enforcement colleagues had framed an innocent man. Tens of millions watched, the show won four Emmys, and Mr. Colborn became infamous.<br />Before “Making a Murderer” aired, a Google search of his name “would have revealed two nondescript news articles about routine local crime,” he alleges in a lawsuit. Now it turns up hundreds of thousands. He and his family have received violent threats that “fill the capacity of 28 compact discs,” the lawsuit claims. (Mr. Colborn, who retired in 2018, declined an interview request.)<br />Netflix has made a major push into original documentaries. Lisa Nishimura, who oversees the effort, has said the company’s objective is to “create a cultural moment” and “allow people to enter a distinct experience to help us try to better understand the world around us.” In 2018 Barack and Michelle Obama cut a multiyear production deal with Netflix, and Mr. Obama said last year that their productions would touch “on issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights.”<br />“Making a Murderer” is the streaming giant’s most famous documentary. I examined thousands of pages of courtroom transcripts, police reports and other public records. They leave little doubt that the series is dishonest. Examples abound of selectively edited footage and omission or distortion of key facts.<br />“Making a Murderer” is particularly egregious, but it’s part of a broader campaign by Netflix against police and in support of progressive causes. Former prosecutor Linda Fairsteindescribed in these pages last year how another documentary, “When They See Us,” was “so full of distortions and falsehoods as to be an outright fabrication.” Texas Ranger Bob Prince has also complained about significant omissions and distortions in the 2019 series “The Confessions Killer.” The Netflix cultural moments always tilt in the same political direction.</td>

Disney unveiled an array of new shows and bullish revised guidance Thursday that made clear its trio of streaming services—Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+—would seek to take on market leader  Netflix Inc.  in several arenas, including spending on content and the hunt for subscribers around the world.<br />In addition to announcing plans for 100 new titles to debut annually, Disney revised guidance that had previously predicted Disney+ could hit 90 million subscribers by 2024. The new projection was an earthquake: as many as 260 million. Netflix currently has 200 million subscribers, but it isn’t growing as quickly.

Congress has passed it on a bipartisan basis for 59 years in a row. Earlier this week, the House approved final passage by a veto-proof 335-78 majority. The bill will now go to the president’s desk<br />The lopsided votes in both chambers came in the face of Mr. Trump’s strong opposition, as most GOP lawmakers—including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and other Republican leaders—rejected his demands to alter the bill’s text in the waning weeks of his presidency. Among the exceptions were a few Republican senators whose names have been floated as possible future presidential contenders: Sens. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) and Josh Hawley (R., Mo.). A total of 7 Republicans and 6 Democrats voted no.<br />Mr. Trump has said he would veto the NDAA unless Congress eliminates language that creates a commission to rename military installations, monuments and paraphernalia honoring Confederate commanders. He also has insisted on including language in the bill to terminate Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which grants social-media companies broad immunity for the content they publish from users on their sites.<br />In a statement of opposition issued Tuesday, the Trump administration said it strongly opposes the NDAA because it “fails to include critical national-security measures, includes provisions that fail to respect our veterans and our military’s history, and contradicts efforts by this Administration to put America first in our national-security and foreign-policy actions.”</td>

      <td>The Sassoon family, a commercial and financial dynasty of Baghdadi Jewish origin, cut a globalized path through the 19th and early 20th centuries on a scale remarkable even by today’s standards. The family did business everywhere from British India to pre-Communist Shanghai, while putting down roots in Britain. They were also prodigious collectors of Jewish ritual objects and manuscripts. On Dec. 17, key pieces of Judaica owned by members of the Sassoon family will be auctioned at Sotheby’s New York.<br />The Sassoons became prominent in 18th-century Baghdad, where they served as financial advisers to local Ottoman rulers. David Sassoon, who oversaw the family’s move from Baghdad to India in the 1830s, flourished thanks to Britain’s expanding mercantile power, though he never learned to speak English. Even in Bombay (today’s Mumbai), however, “the family staunchly maintained Baghdadi traditions,” says Sharon Liberman Mintz, senior consultant for Judaica at Sotheby’s. One item in the auction is a gold-brocaded silk robe made for Ezekiel Gubbay, son of another prominent Baghdadi Jewish family, for his marriage to David Sassoon’s granddaughter Aziza in 1853; though made in India, it was designed in a Baghdadi style.<br />Flora Sassoon, Aziza’s daughter, became the matriarch of the most pious branch of the family in Britain, and her son, noted London bibliophile David Solomon Sassoon, expanded its collection of Jewish objects and manuscripts. The member of the family who is best known today, the World War I poet Siegfried Sassoon, belonged to a different branch; his father was disinherited after marrying outside the Jewish faith.<br />Two 18th-century parcel-gilt silver and enamel Torah shields, starring items in the auction, were bequeathed to Flora by a Sassoon relation. In the Ashkenazi Jewish tradition of Central and Eastern Europe, such breastplate-like shields are placed on the textile mantle covering a Torah scroll. Jewish religious life in early modern Europe was rich in such ornamental objects, but Ms. Liberman Mintz says that more often than not they were made by Christians, since Jews usually weren’t allowed to join craftsmen’s guilds.<br />These Torah shields are an exception. Here “we have a Jewish artisan looking at Jewish sources,” Ms. Liberman Mintz says. One shield is signed by its maker, Elimelekh Tzoref of Stanislav, a Polish town now in Ukraine. The front shows the figures of Moses and Aaron, while the back displays biblical scenes and imagery surrounded by a rococo arch. The piece has a pre-auction estimate of $600,000 to $900,000.</td>

      <td>A newly finished restoration of the Empire State Building gives us the chance to again appreciate the structure’s glittering brilliance.</td>
      <td>The Empire State Building is an expression of Jazz Age exuberance so familiar we can easily miss it. Be sure to look at it now, though, because the building has never appeared brighter. A bottom-to-top restoration, 15 years in the making, has just wrapped up at the circular observation level on the 102nd floor and returned the building to its original wonder.<br />And what a wonder it is. An encrustation of obsolete radio equipment and dunnage has been removed from around its spire, or “mooring mast,” and relocated to the single top antenna spike. The sky-high work has revealed the full glistening form of this faceted glass lantern and its four aluminum wings. Cleaned, sealed and repainted, the building now never stops shining, again able to reflect sunlight by day just as it glows from inner illumination by night.<br />The final, astonishing masterpiece of the Roaring ’20s, the Empire State Building opened in the Depression-plagued 1930s as “the eighth wonder of the world.” Its appeal has always seemed historic, not just of one particular age but one for the ages. Ninety years ago, returning to New York for the first time since the Crash, F. Scott Fitzgerald observed this “last and most magnificent of towers” as rising “from the ruins, lonely and inexplicable as the sphinx.” From the moment it was first sketched out to its completion just 18 months later, on up to the travails of the present day, Empire State has been there to elevate us out of our street-level depressions.<br />The term “mooring mast” should suggest the particular magic of Empire State’s design. When a former General Motors executive named John J. Raskob wanted to construct a singular office building at 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, he looked to the architect William Lamb to design a tower that would rise with unprecedented speed from this central plot of Manhattan Island. Lamb edited his tower back to the essentials of machine-made form. The design cut every corner but the ones that mattered. An army of actual skywalkers would slot in 600 million pounds of prefabricated steel, limestone, and chrome-nickel panels. Light, strength and lift were everything as the enterprise aimed to become the tallest building in the world.<br />The office-level floors of Empire State wear these considerations right on their face. The building’s smooth skin has little want of setbacks or shadows. Its minimal articulations balance height and mass in classical proportions with only the most distilled Art Deco details. What matters are the window lines of glistening metal all connecting, all pointing up.</td>

BlackRock, however, hasn’t signed onto this initiative.<br />Many of the recent green commitments haven’t specified consequences for companies that don’t meet the emissions targets.</td>

      <td>Bidders have little to lose in the first auction of federal leases for oil production in California in eight years.</td>
      <td>In what was either expensive political point-scoring or an absolute steal in the energy market, the first federal leases for oil and gas development in California in eight years were auctioned on Thursday.<br />The Trump administration announced plans last year to auction leases on about a million acres of federal land in California, setting off a flurry of legal challenges in the environmentally conscious state. In the end it came down to just 4,133 acres in Kern County, where there are existing oil fields. The Bureau of Land Management estimated that up to 10 wells could be drilled on the newly leased parcels.<br />Taxpayers didn’t get much for all the trouble—only $53,562, the price of less than 1,200 barrels of crude. That could be an amazing deal for the companies that purchased the leases, even after paying rent plus royalties on any oil produced. Federal leases adjacent to producing properties have fetched prices 30 or more times as much per acre.<br />The purchases are a bet that legal challenges won’t stop development. President-elect Joe Biden has said he will ban new leases on public lands; so there also could be attempts to reverse such deals, but the buyers would largely be made whole. They may annoy some government officials, and ultimately the purchasers don’t have much to lose.<br />Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com</td>

      <td>With concerts and festivals canceled due to the pandemic, musical artists moved performances online and still released a trove of outstanding records.</td>
      <td><br />On Feb. 28, the K-Pop band BTS canceled its April tour dates in South Korea because of the coronavirus. It was one of the earliest instances of a major musical name realizing that putting on concerts in 2020 was about to get difficult, and live music in the U.S. was upended shortly thereafter. By the time the SXSW Festival was canceled on March 6 and then Coachella on March 10 postponed its event until October—only to remove it from the calendar entirely in June—it became clear that live shows weren’t coming back anytime soon.<br />And so 2020 turned into the year each of us, individually, reconfigured how music fit into our lives. If your fandom extended to concerts in any form, you felt that loss, deeply. Musicians pivoted, experimenting with streaming shows and unconventional events of all kinds. Verzuz, a webcast series started by veteran producers Timbaland and Swizz Beats, found high-profile artists in hip-hop and R&B facing off in DJ battles where they played the best songs from their own catalogs in live-streamed competitions. Paid performances included sets from artists including Billie Eilish, Nick Cave and many others. Oklahoma psychedelic rock band the Flaming Lips even staged a show in which they encased each audience member in a one-person plastic bubble.<br />Though online events allowed fans to gather virtually to hear music together and also sometimes offered financial support to cash-strapped artists—a year without shows devastated those who depend on concerts to pay the bills—the gap between watching music digitally and seeing it in person is enormous. Live gigs create a space where anything can happen, and the uncertainty raises the excitement. A screen, which drastically reduces the amount of information that reaches our senses, inevitably shrinks possibilities.<br />Even in this altered reality, albums from artists big and small kept coming all year. If only a few releases seemed like true events, we might blame our fragmented attention and the difficulty of promoting new music when live performance was off the table. Absent the typical spate of extra-musical activity—television appearances, festival gigs—it was easy to lose track of records just weeks after they came out. To remedy that, here’s a rundown of 10 of the best from this strangest of years.</td>

      <td>An author of cookbooks devoted to the gastronomic potential of plants still eats meat occasionally</td>
      <td>In the late 1970s, vegetables were garnish, a way to add color to a meal’s main event. Meat-averse diners were a nuisance at restaurants and tedious at dinner parties. Tofu was for hippies.<br />So what could one possibly serve at a fine-dining restaurant if meat wasn’t on the menu? For Deborah Madison, the founding chef of Greens, an upmarket vegetarian spot that opened in San Francisco in 1979, this question kept her up at night. “I tried to imagine some tired man dully anticipating a plate with a big hole in the middle where the meat would have been,” she writes in her recently published memoir, “An Onion in My Pocket: My Life with Vegetables.” Crafting nice salads and appetizers from local produce was easy enough, as most diners had lower expectations for smaller plates. But what entree would sate the habitual carnivore who had been dragged by a loved one to Greens?<br />Ms. Madison’s elegant answers to this question not only made Greens a success but helped redefine plant-based dining in America. Decades before “farm-to-table” food became chic, she loaded her car with fresh herbs and vegetables grown nearby and planned her menu by the “sweet perfumes” wafting from the back seat. To create a sense of occasion, she often folded, wrapped or stacked her main dishes and used plenty of butter, cream and cheese. Meals that sound familiar today—such as a mushroom ragout or an artichoke, leek and goat-cheese tart—were revelatory then.<br />“People didn’t miss the meat,” says Alice Waters of the famed restaurant Chez Panisse in nearby Berkeley, Calif. “They came for the flavors, the ambience and the sense of beauty in the food.”<br />Having recently revisited the cookbook of Greens recipes she co-wrote in 1987, Ms. Madison admits that she was “horrified” to see so much cheese. “We were really insecure,” she says with a chuckle over the phone from her home near Santa Fe, where she has lived for the past 30 years with her husband, Patrick McFarlin, a painter and graphic designer. In her eagerness to ensure that Greens’s patrons felt satisfied, she says she added cheese to nearly everything.</td>

Fighting broke out again in November after nearly three decades in which a United Nations-brokered cease-fire helped maintain relations between Morocco and Algeria, the main backer of the independence movement. Both countries are important security partners of both the U.S. and Europe.<br />If the violence goes unchecked, observers warn it could damage security in the broader region, drawing in criminal networks smuggling weapons and contraband that could link it with conflicts in Libya, Mali and Niger.<br />“This is an issue that needs attention, needs resolution, and is moving from a simmer into a low boil. Trump has just turned up the fire,” said Hannah Rae Armstrong, an independent expert on the conflict.<br />Mr. Trump’s proclamation on Thursday backed Morocco’s claim to Western Sahara in return for opening diplomatic relations with Israel, the fourth country to do so since August as a part of a White House effort to broker relations between the Jewish-led state and Middle Eastern neighbors.</td>

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a reading of 75.5.<br />Rosier expectations for the economy drove the index’s rebound, though respondents’ views on current economic conditions improved as well.<br />“Most of the early December gain was due to a more favorable long-term outlook for the economy, while year-ahead prospects for the economy as well as personal finances remained unchanged,” said Richard Curtin, the survey’s chief economist.<br />A partisan skew in views was responsible for much of the upward shift in sentiment, Mr. Curtin said, with Democrats becoming more optimistic about the economy and Republicans more pessimistic, following President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election.</td>

      <td>The paradox of ‘a jewel in the midst of a marsh.’</td>
      <td>In late antiquity, even before the fall of the western Roman empire, all roads began to lead away from Rome. Emperors abandoned the old capital and moved closer to the frontiers. In the east, they resided at Nicomedia, Thessalonike and eventually Constantinople, Constantine the Great’s “New Rome” on the Bosporus, founded in A.D. 330. Trier was their preferred headquarters in Gaul, and Milan their city of choice in northern Italy. In the fifth century, as the empire began to collapse and was invaded by barbarian armies who threatened Rome’s food supply, ordinary people also moved away from the former capital, whose population gradually declined. In the summer of 402, with Goths crossing the Alps, the western emperor Honorius moved his court to Ravenna, a naval base on the Adriatic. It had an excellent harbor from which he could (and did) receive reinforcements from his brother at Constantinople. The place was surrounded by swamps and rivers, making it famously difficult to besiege, and its “undeveloped urban plan . . . allowed the imperial court to impose its presence.”<br />Judith Herrin’s recent book contains a sweeping and engrossing history of Ravenna from the moment Honorius took up residence there, through the thriving period of Gothic rule (493-540), and culminating in the two centuries (540-751) when the city was a western outpost of the eastern Roman empire. In that last phase, the city was the capital of a territory called the exarchate, whose commander, the exarch, was sent from Constantinople. Ms. Herrin, a professor emerita of classics at King’s College London, is a past master at writing histories of the early medieval world that combine Eastern and Western perspectives and show why we should not study the one without the other. “Ravenna” offers an accessible narrative that brings to life the men and women who created the city during this period and who fashioned its hybrid Christian culture of Latin, Greek and Gothic elements. The narrative is periodically elevated by discussions of the city’s most famous attractions and its glorious churches, brilliantly illustrated in the book’s 62 color plates. It is also enlivened by recurring digressions on daily life in the city at each phase in its history, insofar as that is revealed by documentary papyri containing wills, donations and contracts that fortuitously survive. These local perspectives are complemented by a global outlook: Ms. Herrin’s argument is that Ravenna passed its unique hybrid culture on to the imperial centers all around it, to Rome, Constantinople, and later to Aachen, the capital of Charlemagne in the north. This made the city the “crucible of Europe.”<br />Ravenna, a jewel in the midst of a marsh, was a place of paradox. It was, to allude to a collection of Ms. Herrin’s previous studies, simultaneously both metropolis and margin. In the era of the late Roman emperors (fifth century), the city hosted the court but had a relatively small population compared to Rome and was always looking toward developments at Rome and Constantinople. It was, at first, an administrative center with no identity, a kind of Brasilia that was only slowly built up by the court in its own imperial Christian image. The place had no prestige past of its own, either classical or Christian. Under the rule of Theoderic the Great (493-526), Ravenna was briefly the capital of a power structure that stretched from Spain to the Balkans, but Theoderic still had to maneuver carefully between Rome and Constantinople. In theory, he was ruling the former on behalf of the latter, and his followers, who were barbarians (Goths) and heretics (Arians) in the eyes of the Romans, were an occupying force that were stationed in the north and away from the old capital. The Gothic experiment did not last once the eastern emperor Justinian decided to end it in the 530s. Under Byzantine rule, Ravenna was the capital of the exarchate, and gradually developed its own civic traditions and identity, but still it received its governing class from abroad, and people at the real center of power, Constantinople, saw it as a remote outpost. Ravenna “could not generate and direct its own future” and “was never fully its own agent.” It was a capital of convenience, we might say.<br />And yet each successive regime that ruled in Ravenna not only left its mark there, it was in that city more than anywhere else that it left its most iconic images. No late Roman imperial church can compete with the mosaics of the churches of Ravenna. Likewise no barbarian kingdom that emerged in post-Roman Europe left anything that can compete with Theoderic’s palace church of Sant’Apollinare Nuovo or his mausoleum, capped by a 230-ton block of Istrian stone (the only actual Gothic building in Europe, apart from some minor chapels in Spain). Finally, the most spectacular images of Byzantine imperial power are the famous panel mosaics of Justinian and Theodora in the church of San Vitale. Why was Ravenna endowed with such a density of exemplary images?<br />One explanation is that its successive rulers were trying to leave their mark on a place that was previously undemarcated, to project their power onto an urban topography that did not already convey the desired message in the way that Rome and Constantinople did. Moreover, as Ms. Herrin argues, they were competing with each other in a visual arms-race. Galla Placidia, Honorius’ half-sister, had adorned San Giovanni Evangelista with images of her many imperial ancestors, which led Theoderic to put his own image in Sant’Apollinare Nuovo. This, in turn, provoked Justinian to put his and his wife’s images in San Vitale. (An eastern Roman emperor would otherwise not normally put his image in a church.) As Ravenna wound its circuitous historical route from west Roman to Gothic and then to east Roman rule, it acquired the visual armature of all three, as they competed to own this marginal centerpiece.</td>

      <td>The photographer known for his images of the celebrated was also a chronicler of subterranean fears.</td>
      <td>In the middle of September 1952, Charlie Chaplin came to Richard Avedon’s photo studio. Avedon, then 29, had been chasing him for years, but Chaplin never answered his letters. And then the phone rang. Avedon thought it was a joke and hung up, but Chaplin called back and said he was coming right over. Avedon sent his assistants out of the studio so that there would be no distractions.<br />At first, Avedon shot a few pictures straight on, “almost as though I was doing a passport picture.” When Avedon thought he had his shot, Chaplin asked, “Now, I could do something for you.” He lowered his head, and came up grinning in extreme closeup, with his fingers forming horns on the side of his head—the great god Pan. Or, if you believed Joe McCarthy, J. Edgar Hoover and their anticommunist minions, Satan incarnate. Chaplin did it once more, and the second time was the keeper. That night Chaplin and his family left for London to premiere his film “Limelight.” Two days out of New York, Chaplin’s re-entry permit was revoked by U.S. authorities. He wouldn’t come back to America for 20 years.<br />“I can’t take responsibility for this picture,” Avedon would write. “It was one of those perfect moments when the light was right, and I was there, and the sitter offered the photographer a gift . . . the kind of gift that arrives once in a lifetime.”<br />The photographer was being unnecessarily modest. There were too many pictures like that in Richard Avedon’s life for them to have been glorious accidents. All photographers want to get a great shot, but Avedon went a step beyond: he wanted to get the definitive shot, and he often did. Think of his Marilyn Monroe, looking off-camera and lost, as if her dog had just died. Avedon’s best work came from a place of joy, or, failing that, enthrallment—Chaplin of course, Jean Renoir, Dovima and the elephants.<br />His most uncomfortably startling work derived from contempt—his series of portraits of his elderly father, a man he disliked and for good reason. Jack Avedon thought his son was soft and overly sensitive, and provided a grim counterexample by dumping Avedon’s mother and refusing to support her.</td>

      <td>Selected by Phillip Lopate, editor of ‘The Glorious American Essay.’</td>
      <td>By Mary McCarthy (1961)<br />1. These essays, accumulated from 1946 to 1961, offer a vivid, stimulating challenge to that “age of conformity.” If variety is a charm of essay collections, their bane can be a random unevenness—here overcome by a furiously cool, contrarian intelligence, which unifies this assortment of pieces about politics, literature, sex, theater and fashion. Questioning with aphoristic zingers the Kinsey Reports’ mechanistic approach to the female orgasm, the journalistic pieties of John Hersey’s “Hiroshima,” the upwardly mobile aspirations of women’s fashion magazines, the genius of Tennessee Williams, the anti-American tourist reports of Simone de Beauvoir, the outrages of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Mary McCarthy spares neither the right nor the left—nor herself. In “My Confession,” she describes how, starting out from the wrong motives—ignorance, shallowness, vanity, social snobbery—she arrived at a coherent liberal anticommunist position. “I realized, with a certain wistfulness, that it was too late for me to become a Marxist. Marxism, I saw, from the learned young men I listened to at Committee meetings, was something you had to take up young, like ballet dancing.”<br />Edited by Katharine Ogden Michaels (2009)<br />2. A master of the short story, whose tales conveyed high anxiety, urban violence and exuberant intellectual analysis, Leonard Michaels was also an extraordinarily fine essayist. This collection, assembled posthumously by his widow, Katharine Michaels, is divided between critical and autobiographical essays, though everything Michaels wrote was deeply personal. Whether seeing as a boy the movie “Gilda,” where the heroine marries a sadist played by George Macready (“I didn’t want Macready to unzipper Rita Hayworth’s dress”), or his father offering him some money before his date (“He gave. I took.”), Michaels gets to feelings of vulnerability and shame with astonishing speed. Raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan by Jewish immigrant parents, speaking only Yiddish until he was 5, he perfected a terse English sentence that carries traces of Yiddish’s ironic, singsong, questioning shrug. “Paradox as a cognitive mode is everywhere in Yiddish. It’s probably in the genes and may explain the Jewish love of jokes.” His humor is both hilarious and dark, issuing from an evolved persona that had elements of the street-savvy hipster, academic and Talmudist. Above all, he was a storyteller—proof positive that good essays are at bottom stories about the mind at work.<br />By Vladimir Nabokov (1951)</td>

      <td>National politics may be paralyzed by partisanship, but states, cities and ordinary citizens are coming together to get things done.</td>
      <td>As debate about police behavior raged over the summer in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, the nation’s elected leaders in Washington seemed unable to agree on any response, except perhaps to amplify the shouting.<br />In Kansas City, Mo., however, Mayor Quinton Lucas took the simplest of steps to build public confidence in police accountability: He moved to make it easier for a citizen to file a complaint about police behavior, in part by removing a strange legal requirement that any complaint had to be notarized. “Washington did not become a place for positive results in law-enforcement reform,” says Mr. Lucas, who is a Democrat.<br />Similarly, while the national debate over abortion rights has escalated in response to Donald Trump’s Supreme Court appointments, Kathleen Wilson, the founder of a program in Fredericksburg, Va., that provides homes for pregnant women seeking an alternative to abortion, raised enough money to finish buying a house for expectant mothers. She had enough funds left over to help young mothers unable to make rent payments amid the coronavirus economic slump. “I don’t think of this ministry as being political,” she says of her organization, Mary’s Shelter. “We try not to be.”<br />And while national politicians lapsed into finger-pointing over shortages of masks and surgical gowns during the pandemic, two businesswomen in Morganton, N.C., organized a network of small textile companies in the area to begin producing half a million masks and surgical gowns for the region’s doctors, hospitals, businesses and citizens. “In the early days it was like Rosie the Riveter,” says Sara Chester, one of the businesswomen. “Everybody wanted to do their part.”<br />There are potentially big lessons in such small steps. At a time of deepening national divisions and political tribalism, many Americans have decided to rely less on Washington to deal with problems and have turned for answers to local institutions, state governments, business leaders, their own communities and one another.</td>

In their first day of trading, shares of Airbnb closed more than double where they were priced just one day earlier. DoorDash closed Thursday 82% higher than its own initial-public-offering price. Airbnb is now worth more than five times the implied post-money valuation of its debt raise back in April, according to PitchBook, and more than the combined market values of several of its largest hotel competitors.<br />Day traders aren’t rushing into these names just for the fun of it. Low interest rates have almost forced anyone looking to make meaningful returns this year into the public markets, explaining in part the record number of blank-check companies that have recently listed. But this week’s traditional listings seem to be at the center of all that is trending in 2020, most notably the acceleration of the shift toward online commerce.<br />The pandemic has made businesses which have brought safety and ease to how we travel and eat seem not only attractive but essential in the near term. And as opposed to fellow unicorns like Uber and  Lyft ,  who have yet to turn a profit, both DoorDash and Airbnb have managed to turn a profit on a select basis for some period of the year and have outshone their competitors.<br />With so many consumers fleeing the big cities over the last several months, Airbnb has pared down its ambitions to become a broader hospitality conglomerate to emphasize its homestay accommodations in more remote locations. DoorDash has welcomed the urban exodus with open arms, having built their business to capitalize on suburban markets from the beginning.</td>

      <td>In Burning Questions, we expertly answer your pressing (and not-so-pressing) queries on topics related to fashion and style.<br />Early-20th-century skiers mostly layered up in bulky sweaters and wool gabardine pants. But after Alpine skiing made its Olympics debut in 1936 and gained popularity, sleek new styles began to appear. A savvy, newly mobile community embraced the pastime during the post-WWII years, triggering an explosion of technical, fashion-forward mountain-wear brands.<br />During this midcentury era, designers like  Christian Dior  and Emilio Pucci introduced sport lines for their jet-set clients, while now-classic ski labels like Obermeyer and Bogner took off. Maria Bogner (wife to Olympics skier Willy Bogner, who founded the brand) took issue with existing bulky alpine design and created the first stretch ski-pant in 1948, a style the Bogner catalog still features today.<br />In the ’70s and ’80s, silhouettes slimmed down even further, a movement led by racing brands like Spyder, launched in 1978. Boot-cut pants and neon colors glided into the on-slope mix. In the rebellious ’90s, splatter prints were popular, and the early 2000s welcomed the baggy, oversize look favored by snowboarders.<br />Today, anything goes. Brands like Perfect Moment offer retro, tightfitting ski pants with padded racing knees, while environmentally conscious companies like Helly Hansen and Patagonia are investing in chemical-free production and recycled fabrics.</td>

In our 70s and 80s, we are happier than when we were strong and beautiful 20-year-olds.<br />There are a couple of theories about why this is. We may get better at avoiding stressful situations—we figure out how to dodge that tense work meeting or family squabble. Or there may be something about aging that makes it easier to tolerate stress, even when we can’t avoid it.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic is a test case for this principle. It’s a terrible threat that is stressful for everyone, but it’s especially dangerous for older people, who are far more likely to die from the disease. Does the association between aging and happiness still hold?</td>

Two decades of House maps show how Democrats have become the party of metropolitan America, particularly in the Northeast and the West. By contrast, Republicans are dominant in the heartland and in less-populous places outside the big metros, particularly in the South and much of the Midwest.<br />The chart below shows that in almost every election, the party that gains seats does so in all regions of the country. But amid those changes, the nation’s geographic divide has widened. While the Northeast and West in 2000 showed much different political profiles than the South, those differences are substantially wider today.<br />House maps over time show the changing contours of the parties’ strength in different parts of the nation.<br />The House map produced by the election of 2000 shows Democratic blue in North Dakota and northern Minnesota as well as splashes of blue in central Missouri, West Virginia and the Carolinas. Many of these regions were represented by “Blue Dog’’ Democrats, or centrist members of the party who won support from voters in rural communities, small towns and smaller metros.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Congress is grappling with whether lawmakers should be among the first to receive the coronavirus vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve on an emergency basis in coming days.<br />The authorization is expected to lead to distribution by year’s end to limited groups such as health-care workers and the elderly, with several months until the general public is able to get vaccinated. Now policy makers face the question of whether lawmakers should receive priority as important elected officials and to give the public confidence in the vaccine—or whether they should wait in line with their constituents.<br />“There are ongoing discussions,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said on Wednesday. “Of course, many qualify in terms of the high-risk groups, in terms of age. But in addition to that, clearly, it is critical that we have the Congress in a condition where it can operate on a continuing basis, given the challenges that confront us of great immediacy.”<br />The Senate’s health-panel chairman, Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), said he had early Wednesday told Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and other public officials they needed to decide when lawmakers should be vaccinated.<br />“If they want public figures to take the vaccine early in order to reassure Americans that it’s safe, I’m sure many of us will do that,” Mr. Alexander said he told Mr. Redfield. “They need to say it’s more important for public figures to take it in order to encourage people to do it.

      <td>After 287 days, a bubble, and a non-bubble, Major League Soccer is finally game away from closing out 2020.</td>
      <td>The 2020 Major League Soccer season—in its normal, pre-pandemic form—lasted less than two weeks before grinding to a halt. Teams in early March were barely two games in. NYC FC was still waiting for its first goal. Inter Miami hadn’t even broken out its home jerseys.<br />As it turned out, that was only a false start. What followed over the next nine months was the wildest schedule attempted by any professional sports league in America.<br />When resuming the regular season seemed impossible, MLS rushed back to the field before the NBA or Major League Baseball to play a brand new tournament, invented specifically for 2020, inside a bubble in Florida. Once that worked out, MLS doubled down. Not only would it pick up its regular season—it would send teams back to their home markets to finish the interrupted season. While they were at it, MLS tacked on a full playoff slate for them too.<br />By the time the 2020 season ends, after Saturday’s MLS Cup final between the Seattle Sounders and the Columbus Crew, the league will have somehow organized 324 games in the year of the pandemic.<br />“We had no sense whatsoever that we’d be able to pull that off,” MLS Commissioner Don Garber said this week, looking back on the longest season in the league’s 25-year history.</td>

      <td>Entertainment titan’s ambitious new subscriber targets could put it past streaming pioneer</td>
      <td>Walt Disney Co.  only seems like a cautious company.<br />Fairly new to the streaming world, the entertainment giant has caught on quick. Disney+, its first streaming service under its flagship brand that only launched last November, now has 86.8 million paying subscribers. That’s about where the company first thought it would land after five years, and the success of the effort has convinced Disney to rethink its priorities—and pour some gas on the fire. The company announced late Thursday that its new target for Disney+ is a range of 230 million to 260 million paid subscribers by the end of its fiscal year 2024.<br />Even streaming pioneer  Netflix  hasn’t reached close to that level yet. And if you factor in Disney’s other streaming properties like Hulu and ESPN+, the company sees the full base of paid subscribers for its direct-to-consumer offerings hitting a range of 300 million to 350 million by September of 2024. Wall Street analysts currently expect Netflix’s global subscriber base to just be crossing the 300 million mark by that time, according to consensus projections tabulated by FactSet.<br />It is an ambitious goal, and hardly a sure thing, especially since both Disney and Netflix can chalk up a good deal of their recent success to the pandemic that has shuttered movie theaters, theme parks, restaurants and other entertainment options. Netflix has explicitly warned investors that much of its recent growth was likely pulled forward from future periods. And while Netflix is a streaming-only company, Disney made clear at a four-hour investor event Thursday that it is not throwing in the towel on theatrical movies. The company maintains plans to release big-budget movies next year and beyond from its properties including Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar and Disney.<br />But Disney now has a lot of ways to play both sides of the fence. The company previewed several shows and movies from its blockbuster franchises coming to Disney+. This includes a full Star Wars movie called “Andor” from Bourne movies screenwriter Tony Gilroy, coming in 2022. It also has several series coming from its Marvel universe, while its ownership of the old Twentieth Century Fox business and channels such as FX give the company plenty of material to appeal across audience types. The success of Disney+ gives the company options to stay flexible, contrasting with a recent move by  AT&T ’s  WarnerMedia division to move the full slate of its Warner Bros. theatrical movies targeted for next year to its HBO Max service, which has seen much lower adoption.</td>

      <td>Moderna, Pfizer now include children in trials, as health experts urge more such research to help curb transmission and reopen schools</td>
      <td>Pharmaceutical companies and health officials are homing in on a key sector of the population that has been largely left out of planning for Covid-19 vaccines: children.<br />Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  whose jointly developed vaccine is now being rolled out in the U.K., became the first Covid-19 vaccine developers to include children in U.S. trials in September.  Moderna Inc.,  whose vaccine has also shown to be effective in adults, said Thursday it began a trial for children 12 to 17 years old.  AstraZeneca  PLC also plans a U.S. trial for children.<br />The omission of children in U.S. vaccine trials so far worries public-health experts, who say they don’t know whether the vaccines are safe for children or need changes to dosage levels. While children are less likely than adults to fall gravely ill or die because of Covid-19, researchers say, vaccinating them will help prevent the spread of the virus and achieve herd immunity.<br />Yet some experts don’t expect a children’s vaccine will be ready by the 2021 school year because of how long trials take, even on the accelerated timeline for Covid-19 vaccines. “I’m pretty worried that the window’s closing if it hasn’t already closed,” said Evan Anderson, a pediatrics professor at the Emory University School of Medicine. “The timing then becomes a challenge in order to achieve enough data such that you’ve had a vaccine fully tested and evaluated over the spring and summer.”<br />The American Academy of Pediatrics recently sent a letter to federal officials urging children to be included in clinical studies. In the letter, AAP noted that more than two-thirds of the children who died from Covid-19 infections were Black or Latino.</td>

The charge of collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.<br />The police didn’t give further details, but a story in Mr. Lai’s newspaper, Apple Daily, said the charge was “reportedly based on Lai’s acceptance of interviews and calls for sanctions from foreign governments.”<br />Enforcement actions against pro-democracy figures have been accelerating in Hong Kong. In recent weeks, authorities expelled opposition lawmakers from the legislature and jailed prominent activists including Joshua Wong on crimes related to the mass protests that rocked Hong Kong last year.<br />On Monday, Hong Kong police arrested eight men related to a peaceful protest at a university this year, three of them on suspicion of national security crimes. On Tuesday, police arrested seven pro-democracy activists, including a former lawmaker, related to participation in a protest on July 1, the day after the national security law was imposed.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—For a year that started out with a share crash, a record loss and a global pandemic, 2020 is turning out to be very good for  SoftBank Group  Corp.<br />The Japanese technology investor, best known for its $100 billion Vision Fund and its mercurial chief executive, Masayoshi Son, this week scored an estimated $11 billion paper gain when U.S. food-delivery company  DoorDash Inc.  went public. It was the latest in a series of wins as soaring tech stocks pushed up the value of many of  SoftBank ’s  holdings.<br />Cashing in on another investment, SoftBank said Friday that it agreed to sell an 80% stake in Boston Dynamics, a company known for dog-like robots that can maneuver through rooms, to  Hyundai Motor Group .  The deal valued the robotics company at $1.1 billion. SoftBank has said more of its portfolio companies are poised to list or go on sale next year.<br />SoftBank’s share price has increased, too—around 9% this week alone and 66% this year. That puts this week’s stock level at its highest in 20 years, but still more than 20% below the bubble peak. The shares, which finished trading at 7,913 yen, equivalent to $76.04, on Friday, were pushed up by the overall market swell as well as a roughly $23 billion share-buyback program that is one of the world’s largest.<br />As of Friday, SoftBank has bought back around $14 billion of that total. The company is considering further buybacks that will lower the amount of shares outstanding and raise Mr. Son’s stake, said people with knowledge of the strategy. That in turn could make it easier for Mr. Son to realize a long-held idea of taking SoftBank private, they said.</td>

      <td>High prices will require capital discipline from the U.S. shale industry as well as a rebound in global demand</td>
      <td>Vaccines have buoyed hopes that oil demand will soon recover, and the Brent global benchmark is back above $50 a barrel. But traders may be underestimating the responsiveness of U.S. supply.<br />It has been a terrible year for the oil industry. A price war followed by a global pandemic forced many producers to slash spending on the search for new oil reserves. Historically, significant underinvestment in drilling has prompted a price spike when demand eventually rebounded, given the long lead time to find and develop new oil sources.<br />U.S. shale oil has changed that dynamic in recent years, though. The sector’s ability to ramp up production rapidly means the high prices that historically resulted from big cuts to capital expenditure no longer look to be such a sure thing. Also, the U.S. industry has for years frustrated efforts by Moscow and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase prices by cutting production, creating a glut. A recent proposal to add the main U.S. export price, WTI Midland, to the global oil benchmark from 2022 is a testament to shale oil’s importance in global supply.<br />True, shale producers have consolidated this year and come under investor pressure to focus on cash flow rather than growth. “The rules of the game have changed” and the industry no longer has access to the “incredible amounts of capital” it did just a year ago, says Benjamin Shattuck of energy consultant Wood Mackenzie.<br />Yet any newfound discipline may not last. Oil is up about a quarter since early November, when the first effective vaccine was announced. At the current U.S. benchmark price of just under $47, many reserves could be profitably lifted, particularly with today’s lower drilling costs. “As you move above $45 a barrel it gives you way more commercial drilling,” says Alisa Lukash of energy consultant Rystad Energy, referring to U.S. shale.</td>

      <td>With help from tech startups, the concept of timeshare vacation homes is shaking off its stodgy old image. Even commitment-phobes might be tempted.</td>
      <td>EARLIER THIS fall, Devin Florez, who lives in St. Louis, took his 8-year-old niece to Disney World. He felt safe heading to the park, he said, knowing both he and his niece would be masked, most of their time would be spent outdoors and they would be able to maintain social distancing. But with Covid-19 raging, he worried about booking nights at a hotel, where they’d encounter any number of other guests and staff. When first planning the trip, Mr. Florez, 34, began browsing  Airbnb s in Orlando, but costs were high. Then he saw a promo on the Points Guy, a blog focused on travel-club loyalty points, for $150 off bookings with Koala, a new platform that follows Airbnb’s model but allows individuals to rent one-time stays in timeshares that would otherwise sit unused.<br />Through Koala, Mr. Florez booked a week stay in a two-bedroom condo that put him within minutes of Disney World and came with amenities like a swimming pool and concierge. Thanks to the Points Guy promo, the cost was a mere $475, or about $68 a night.<br />Covid-19 has battered the travel industry. One-third of American hotels face potential bankruptcy. U.S. air traffic has stalled—in October, U.S. airlines carried 62% fewer passengers than the same month last year. But one sector of the industry continues to grow and is actually thriving in the face of the pandemic: the stodgy old timeshare industry.<br />Traditional timeshares—vacation rentals where ownership is split among several parties—took root in the 1960s. The Hilton Hale Kaanapali, a 253-room condo hotel on Maui, was among the first. Advertised as a “whale of a place to play,” it opened in 1966, with studios priced from $26,000 that could be booked for a maximum of 30 days a year. The timeshare model started popping up in all the usual vacation spots as eager developers lured potential buyers to sales presentations with free toasters and discount helicopter tours. The bait paid off. According to the American Resort Development Association (ARDA), there are currently more than 5,000 timeshare resorts in 121 countries.<br />In early 2020, fear and lockdowns kept customers away from traditional hotels and rental properties. But because timeshares are like second homes for their owners, they didn’t experience the same extreme drop-off, even at the height of coronavirus lockdowns in spring 2020. “Once regulations began to be lifted in July, some places saw occupancies of 100%,” said Jason Gamel, president and CEO of the ARDA.</td>

      <td>Proposal would add accountability, transparency to process by having constituents work with lawmakers to apply for ‘community-focused grants’</td>
      <td>A BIPARTISAN GROUP of lawmakers makes a push to bring back a form of earmarks—lawmakers’ ability to direct federal funding to specific projects —but with more transparency and accountability. The 12 members of the bipartisan House Select Committee on Modernization, a group responsible for updating how Congress operates, are pushing to start a program of “community-focused grants,” which they hope would help restore Congress’s role in making specific decisions about spending taxpayer money.<br />“We laid out a framework that we thought could avoid some of the abuse of the past,” the group’s chairman, Washington Democratic Rep. Derek Kilmer told The Wall Street Journal’s Kristina Peterson. Under the proposal, local communities would work with their members of Congress to apply for a grant through a public database. If approved through the appropriations process, the funds would be subject to congressional oversight and could even be clawed back if lawmakers deemed they were being abused.<br />“It has to be uniquely derived from a local community,” said committee vice chairman Rep. Tom Graves (R., Ga.). For-profit entities wouldn’t be eligible to apply. “The member now becomes more of an advocate for or a shepherd for something that’s important to a local community.” The House banned earmarks in 2011, after the GOP won the majority in Nov. 2010.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) has spoken in favor of restoring some form of earmarks, but it’s not clear how receptive GOP leaders would be in the House or Senate. “Earmarks cause members to vote for excessively expensive spending bills that cost tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in exchange for a few earmarks worth a few million or sometimes just thousands of dollars,” says the Citizens Against Government Waste, an influential conservative group.<br />MAKE FOUNDATIONS SPEND? A coalition of progressive multimillionaires, foundation heads, think tanks, and donor-advised fund managers is calling on Congress and the incoming Biden administration to make a temporary change to tax law to make private foundations give away more of their money  if they want to qualify for tax deductions. They urge the Biden administration and Congress to double the minimum required disbursement by private foundations, set by the Internal Revenue Service. Foundations are now required to pay out 5% of their endowment each year; the letter calls for raising it to 10% for the next three years to raise around $200 billion for struggling charities, without the use of taxpayer funds.</td>

Though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidance on which Americans should be first in line for the initial doses, state governors have the final say—meaning the makeup of the priority line could vary widely by state.<br />Front-line health workers and residents of long-term care facilities are expected to get the first batch of shots, which could come within days pending emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration.<br />Businesses are focusing on where their workers rank in the subsequent wave of recipients, referred to in the federal rollout plan as group “1B.” That group includes essential workers needed to maintain basic services and spans professions as diverse as grocery-store cashiers, bus drivers, teachers and utility workers.<br />The chief executives of Cargill Inc., Smithfield Foods Inc. and Perdue Farms Inc. have said in recent weeks that food workers merit priority for vaccines.

Money manager Jacinto Hernandez has doubts.<br />The partner at Capital Group Cos. liquidated $1 billion in oil and gas stocks as Covid-19 spread around the globe in February, according to regulatory filings. Mr. Hernandez said he suspected the new coronavirus was about to crush global demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel—and with it, any near-term thesis for investing in oil companies.<br />Adam Waterous, a Canadian private-equity investor, looked at the same circumstances and came to the opposite conclusion: This was the time to buy. Demand will eventually bounce back, he said, and when it does, prices will spike sometime later this decade. He backed up that conviction in July when his Waterous Energy Fund purchased a big stake in an oil sands company.<br />“There is absolutely a stigma about investing in oil and gas,” Mr. Waterous said. “It hasn’t been a sexy industry for a while.”<br />The question of whether to invest in oil and gas has become a polarizing issue in the world of money management. Even before the pandemic sapped the world’s thirst for fuel, the future of the fossil-fuel industry was already under threat due to the rise of electric cars, the proliferation of renewable energy and growing consciousness about the long-term impact of climate change.</td>

That will boost the status of already-powerful brands, as well as tech giants like  Amazon  that are eyeing the industry.<br />The luxury business got a crash course in e-commerce when boutiques were closed this year. “Brands made the mental switch from treating digital as 5% of their current business to 35% of future revenue,” says Ian Rogers, the outgoing chief digital officer at  LVMH  Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which poached him from Apple in 2015.<br />Traditionally, high-end brands have been cautious about selling online. While they were growing rapidly, digital transactions were a relatively low 12% of global luxury sales in 2019. They are expected to hit 23% in 2020 and up to one-third by the middle of the decade, according to Bain & Co. projections.<br />Paris-based LVMH, which owns  Christian Dior  and Fendi as well as its namesake brands, spent heavily on e-commerce during the lockdowns. Although the company reduced its overall investment budget this year to save cash, digital’s share of the spending doubled to roughly 25%.<br />Boundaries between store and website sales also blurred in new ways this year. With boutiques closed, shop assistants resorted to contacting customers through messaging apps or arranged digital consultations to drive business. Gucci’s parent company, Kering, expects these so-called “distance sales” to stick. In the future, store workers may log on during quiet times and interact with online shoppers to improve the low sales conversion rates that afflict many luxury-brand websites.</td>
