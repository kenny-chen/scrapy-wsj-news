      <td>President Joe Biden’s empty boasts about his economic plan are going to make Americans long for the understatement of Donald Trump. They may already be longing for Trump-era policies on job creation.<br />One Trump proposal that never came to fruition is nonetheless instructive in demonstrating the modesty of the Trump economic team compared with the Biden braggadocio.<br />In March of 2018, the Trump White House’s Council of Economic Advisers sketched out a plan and described the likely results:<br />As President, Mr. Trump did implement some valuable regulatory reforms, but never reached an agreement with Congress on new infrastructure spending. Now consider the $2.7 trillion Biden plan, which doesn’t include the Trump regulatory reform agenda and spends far more in total but less on actual infrastructure. On Thursday in Lake Charles, Louisiana President Joe Biden said, according to the official White House transcript:<br />If newspapers still wanted to do “fact-checking” after the Trump era and tried to address all the flaws in this one short paragraph, they’d run out of space for Pinocchios.</td>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s decision Monday widens the vaccine’s use to children as young as 12.<br />The move comes after a study of 2,260 adolescents found the two-dose shot worked safely in that age group.<br />Its expanded use is expected to boost a vaccination campaign seeking to immunize as many people as possible before dangerous variants able to elude shots emerge. Wider use of the vaccines also could permit easing of pandemic measures.<br />The expansion “is a significant step in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock. “Today’s action allows for a younger population to be protected from Covid-19, bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic.</td>

      <td>The Colonial Pipeline shutdown is a warning of worse to come.</td>
      <td>The economic damage from the cyber attack that shut down the 5,500-mile Colonial Pipeline—the country’s largest fuel pipeline—should be limited. But it’s a glaring reminder that cyber vulnerabilities in U.S. energy and other systems are the real infrastructure problem that President Biden should be addressing.<br />Colonial transports about 100 million gallons of refined products each day from the Gulf Coast to New York Harbor, supplying nearly half of the East Coast’s fuel. The pipeline’s private operator says it learned Friday that it was hit by a ransomware attack and took “certain systems offline to contain the threat.”<br />In ransomware attacks, criminals use computer code to seize control of information systems and then extort businesses to unlock them. Sometimes they also threaten to dump sensitive intel on the web. The FBI says the DarkSide criminal network believed to be based in Eastern Europe perpetrated the attack.<br />Some in the media are minimizing the attack by noting that DarkSide is only after money and purportedly doesn’t extort schools and hospitals. Small consolation. These thieves are bent on causing damage and have exposed an enormous vulnerability in the U.S. energy system by taking down a critical fuel artery.<br />Fortunately, there was plenty of fuel in storage before the shutdown, and the pipeline should be back online this week. But meantime gasoline will have to be transported by trucks, which is less efficient. Tankers are temporarily storing gasoline off the Gulf Coast. Transportation bottlenecks were already snarling supply-chains, and the pipeline shutdown won’t help.</td>

      <td>The President sees no problem from bonuses not to work. He needs to get out more.</td>
      <td>After a disappointing April jobs report, President Biden on Monday told employers they have nothing to worry about. His view from Mt. Olympus, er, the White House tells him there’s no problem with the federal unemployment bonus, and if there is, the answer is more spending.<br />The usually camera-shy President briefed the press on short notice to address the claim that expanded payments are slowing the jobs recovery. “There’s been a lot of discussion since Friday’s report that people are being paid to stay home rather than go to work,” Mr. Biden said.<br />That’s an understatement. Employers nationwide have complained for months that Washington’s $300-a-week bonus has made it harder to find willing workers. Yet Mr. Biden brushed aside the complaints, saying he and his staff “don’t see much evidence” that the payments are a “major factor.”<br />The perverse incentive of the bonus is clear, and the evidence goes beyond the anecdotes from tens of thousands of employers. The 266,000 net new jobs in April far undershot economists’ forecasts, and the Labor Department’s latest Jolts survey showed some 7.4 million unfilled positions. Bank of America economist Joseph Song notes that any worker earning less than $32,000 annually would get a raise by going on unemployment, according to a Fox Business report.<br />Mr. Biden could reduce the self-inflicted damage by asking Congress to repeal the bonus, which is available through Labor Day. Instead he assured employers that more government aid is the key to more rapid hiring.</td>

      <td>The Trump Administration cited China’s “total control” of the World Health Organization as it walked away from the international body, but rejoining was among Joe Biden’s first acts as President. Watch this month for the first major test of the new Administration’s ability to influence or reform the WHO.<br />The World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body, will meet virtually beginning May 24. At issue is whether Taiwan will be able to participate—or whether China will succeed in blocking its attendance once again.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinkensaid Friday there is “no reasonable justification for Taiwan’s continued exclusion from this forum,” and in a statement last week the G-7 nations supported Taiwan’s inclusion. Mr. Blinken rightly noted that “Taiwan offers valuable contributions and lessons learned from its approach” to global health.<br />As of last week, Taiwan had a total of 12 Covid deaths, and last year it went more than eight months without a known domestic transmission. These numbers are the envy of the world. But China, which covets the island democracy, wants to deny Taiwan any international recognition. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman last week condemned the G-7’s statement as “anachronistic block politics” and “gross interference in Chinese sovereignty.” China may have enough support from member nations to block Taiwan’s participation.<br />That would be a loss for global health and an embarrassment for the Biden Administration. Americans should question whose interests are served by their colossal financial contributions to the WHO.</td>

      <td>Clinging to an emergency policy after the emergency has passed, Chairman Powell courts asset bubbles.</td>
      <td>With Covid uncertainty receding fast, and several quarters deep into the strongest recovery from any postwar recession, the Federal Reserve’s guidance continues to be the most accommodative on record, by a mile. Keeping emergency settings after the emergency has passed carries bigger risks for the Fed than missing its inflation target by a few decimal points. It’s time for a change.<br />The American economy is back to prerecession levels of gross domestic product and the unemployment rate has recovered 70% of the initial pandemic hit in only six months, four times as fast as in a typical recession. Normally at this stage of a recovery, the Fed would be planning its first rate hike. This time the Fed is telling markets that the first hike will happen in 32 months, 2½ years later than normal. In addition, the Fed continues to buy $40 billion a month in mortgages even as housing is clearly running out of supply. And the central bank still isn’t even thinking about ending $120 billion a month of bond purchases.<br />Not only is the recovery happening at record speed, excesses of fiscal policy are already visible. Consumers are spending like never before, construction is booming, and labor shortages are ubiquitous, thanks to direct government transfers. Two-thirds of all relief checks were sent after the vaccines were proved effective and the recovery was accelerating. Opportunistic politicians didn’t let the pandemic go to waste. Especially after the Trump years, Congress has decided to satisfy its long list of unmet desires.<br />Isn’t the Fed’s independence supposed to act as a counterbalance to these political whims?<br />The emergency conditions are behind us. Inflation is already at historical averages. Serious economists soundly rejected price controls 40 years ago. Yet the Fed regularly distorts the most important price of all—long-term interest rates. This behavior is risky, for both the economy at large and the Fed itself.</td>

      <td>Their election bill tries to game the judiciary by routing all legal challenges to the District of Columbia.</td>
      <td>Congress probably won’t pack the Supreme Court. But court picking poses a real threat to Americans’ rights.<br />Court picking is when Congress uses its authority over federal-court jurisdiction to stuff politically sensitive cases from throughout the country into one court that leans its way, to be buried there for as long as possible. Court-picking’s evil genius is its stealth. Americans would notice four new justices, but not changes to technocratic statutes that excite only civil-procedure professors. Despite featuring in Congress’s most radioactive bill—the so-called For the People Act, or H.R.1, which would transform elections and limit Americans’ rights to speak about them—court-picking has escaped notice.<br />It shouldn’t. H.R.1’s court-picking provision would shut courthouse doors throughout the country, attempt to game the outcome in critical cases, deny the Supreme Court the benefit of the federal judiciary’s broad and diverse perspectives, and repeal measures that expedite important lawsuits questioning government power.<br />In one neat court-picking trick, the bill would strip 93 of 94 local federal district courts, and 11 of the 12 regional appellate courts that review their decisions, of their power to hear First Amendment challenges to Congress’s regulation of political speech. All such claims—by Alaskans, Floridians or anyone in between—would be confined to the District of Columbia. Appeals would be heard only in the D.C. Circuit—the court over which Senate Democrats exercised the “nuclear option” in 2013, ramming through four judges who shifted its ideological balance. Imagine if Republicans had passed a voting-rights bill that forced Californians wishing to challenge it to sue in Louisiana, and appeal to some of the country’s most conservative judges.<br />Some complex and discrete legal fields are best assigned to specialized courts. The D.C. Circuit has some unique authority to review administrative cases involving federal agencies, and Congress created the Federal Circuit in 1982 to hear appeals in patent cases nationwide. But all federal judges should be conversant in the Constitution, and Washington-based judges are no better than those elsewhere at interpreting the First Amendment.</td>

      <td>China’s opening to grab supremacy will vanish once its neighbors develop.</td>
      <td>The American debate over China policy is heating up. Last month, Foreign Affairs published an article by Charles Glaser calling on the U.S. to retreat from East Asian commitments as American power declines. In prominent publications ranging from the National Interest to the Atlantic, analysts argue that the U.S. should moderate its China policy for the opposite reason: Beijing is a paper tiger and doesn’t deserve this attention. Further out in the liberal mists, some blame hotheaded China hawks for violence against Asian-Americans and want a softer American China policy as a way of building community at home.<br />The pushback is understandable—the American discussion has moved very far, very fast. Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass has urged Washington to make a formal commitment to defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, while George Soros has termed Xi Jinping the most dangerous enemy that open societies face. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken repeated his predecessor Mike Pompeo’s characterization of Beijing’s treatment of Chinese Uighurs as a “genocide.”<br />The doves are right that something as consequential as U.S.-China policy should be thoroughly debated. They are right, too, that unless that policy stands on a realistic assessment of the costs and consequences, America could find itself committed to policies that voters at home and allies abroad might be unwilling to support when the going gets tough.<br />But the biggest problem with the U.S. China policy debate today is not that it is too hawkish. It’s that the discussion is framed too simplistically. It overstates the danger of war, minimizes Washington’s chances of obtaining its objectives peacefully, exaggerates Beijing’s assets, and inflates the challenge into an inexorably growing, almost unbeatable threat. In the long run American prospects are much brighter than many hawks or doves understand, but for that reason the short-term perils may be greater even than some hawks have acknowledged.<br />The simplistic framing is wrong to cast the U.S. as a declining hegemon increasingly fearful of an inevitably rising China. Beijing is not the predestined ruler of Asia. As with Japan in the 1930s, China is merely a country tempted to exploit a temporary window of opportunity to transform the region in a way it hopes could guarantee its primacy for the long term.</td>

      <td>A judge’s ludicrous tirade targets former Attorney General William Barr.</td>
      <td>Federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson has an answer for all those hoping to heal and move on from the Trump years: Nothing doing.<br />Her answer comes by way of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the left-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. In her ruling, Judge Jackson orders the Justice Department to make public an internal March 2019 memo to then-Attorney General Bill Barr about whether to prosecute President Trump.<br />The pretense is that this is about Mr. Barr, whom the judge accuses of being “disingenuous” about his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In reality, her tirade is but the latest expression of Mueller Madness: the great liberal frustration that, in the end, there was no “there” there in the Mueller report.<br />We know this not from Mr. Trump or Mr. Barr but from their fiercest foes. When Democrats finally did get around to impeaching Mr. Trump, they made a conscious decision to ignore the Mueller report. Instead, their (first) impeachment was over a phone call Mr. Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.<br />On Dec. 10, 2019, the  New York Times  reported that, after consulting with her caucus, Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided the House would move ahead with two articles of impeachment. Each would focus narrowly on Ukraine. A third impeachment charge, tied to Mr. Mueller’s report, was “too much of a reach.”</td>

      <td>Some historians argue that the British could have escaped defeat and might have eventually dealt a mortal blow to the rebellious colonists.</td>
      <td>Americans from childhood are regaled with stirring tales of Lexington and Concord, the crossing of the Delaware, Saratoga, and Valley Forge. They are told almost nothing, unfortunately, about what took place during the Revolutionary War after that. These storied events occur, and then—abracadabra!—Yorktown, with little in between and few connections drawn. In “Winning Independence,” historian John Ferling seeks to fill in the blanks.<br />More than three years passed between the last major battle in the North (Monmouth, June 1778) and the surrender at Yorktown. The war was in fact won during those years, when the British, stalemated in the North, shifted to a “Southern strategy,” based on the notion that vast numbers of loyalists in Georgia and theCarolinas would rally to the cause of King and Country and put down the rebellion.<br />Thousands did fight for the British, but not enough. After shocking losses at Kings Mountain and the Cowpens, as well as in numerous skirmishes, it became increasingly evident to the Tories that the momentum was not with the Crown, and any eagerness to fight plunged. The Continental Army’s war of attrition took its toll. After Yorktown, the British will to win drained away completely.<br />These events and their consequences receive a thorough going over in “Winning Independence,” and in Mr. Ferling’s reconstruction of the Yorktown campaign, he shows how the choices the British faced might have led to different outcomes.<br />In August 1781, when Lord Cornwallis, the British commander in the South, had taken his army to Yorktown, Va., he had an opportunity, however fleeting, to get his army out of danger. French warships allied with George Washington’s Continentals had been spotted in the Chesapeake Bay, and their arrival would make escape impossible. Until then, Cornwallis might still break through the forces under the Marquis de Lafayette surrounding the port.</td>

Du Pont served as governor of Delaware (1977-85), was a candidate for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, continued his Journal column until 2014, and died Saturday at 86:<br /><br />In short, the 2000 election was not primarily about “the economy, stupid,” nor the efficiency of government, nor the number of programs proposed or their cost, nor just how government should be reinvented. It was about values like the quality of education, family and ethics, and the character and trustworthiness of the man who will next lead us. Those are not bad ways to pick a president.<br />It is also clear that these concerns are not evenly spread across the country. There are indeed two Americas, one bicoastal, urban, industrial, and politically very liberal; the other rural, with smaller cities and towns, traditional beliefs about family and morality, and a moderate-to-conservative political outlook.<br />Regardless of whether Mr. Gore is successful in his attempt to overturn the result in Florida, this basic division is going to bedevil American society for some years to come. The Democratic Party is being pushed left. Mr. Gore, as either president or leader of the party, is more liberal than Mr. Clinton; newly elected senators like Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine are very left. People in the rural center will not take kindly to this leftward tilt and will be in continual tension with the other America.</td>

The company didn’t issue a new outlook for the current quarter, but has previously warned that growth is likely to slow as social-distancing guidelines ease. It is working to attract users of older demographics and expand geographically in regions such as Western Europe and East Asia.<br />Roblox is attracting more users to its platform, with the number of average daily users at 42.1 million in the quarter, up 79% from last year, driven by growth outside of its core market of the U.S. and Canada.

Mr. Kelly’s backing came two days after a 4-year-old girl in a stroller and two women were shot in Times Square, adding to concern about gun violence and crime in the city.<br />“Liz Crotty is the whole package, someone who knows the courtroom from both sides as a prosecutor and a defense attorney, and knows that police officers are an irreplaceable partner in keeping the city safe,” said Mr. Kelly, who worked as commissioner under two mayors, David Dinkins, a Democrat, and Michael Bloomberg, who ran as both a Republican and independent.<br />Ms. Crotty is among eight candidates running in the June 22 Democratic primary to replace Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., a three-term Democrat who announced this year he wouldn’t seek re-election.

      <td>WASHINGTON—A U.S. Coast Guard ship accompanying a Navy guided-missile submarine fired more than a dozen warning shots at a swarm of Iranian fast boats during a tense encounter in the Strait of Hormuz on Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said, in at least the third such incident in five weeks.<br />The Coast Guard cutter Maui and five other surface ships were escorting the submarine, USS Georgia, as it surfaced and entered the strait, when 13 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy fast in-shore attack craft armed with machine guns, or FIAC, approached the American ships, John Kirby told reporters Monday.<br />Two of the Iranian boats broke away toward the Maui and the USS Squall, a coastal patrol ship, at high speed with their weapons uncovered and manned, the Navy said in a statement. The remaining 11 FIAC positioned themselves near the American ships, the U.S. Navy said.<br />After the crews of the Maui and Squall issued bridge-to-bridge warnings, blasted the ship’s horn, and used an acoustic warning device, the Maui fired roughly 30 warning shots from a .50-caliber machine gun, the Navy said. The Iranian fast boats, which were roughly 300 yards from the American ships, didn’t retreat but rather moved in within 150 yards, leading the U.S. to fire a second round of warnings, the Navy said. The two boats then withdrew.<br />The encounter is the third between Iranian and U.S. craft since April 2 and came as the U.S. and Iran are engaged in negotiations toward renewing the 2015 multilateral nuclear accord. Those talks began last month in Vienna,and the U.S. and Iran began their latest round of indirect talks on Friday.</td>

The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group of international journalists and critics that has bestowed the awards since the 1940s, has been criticized for a lack of diversity and concerns about its nomination process.<br />NBC’s move comes after viewership of the most recent Globes ceremony sustained a 62% drop, much of which could be attributed to apathetic audiences during the Covid pandemic and a glitchy show that unfolded mostly online. The network, which has an eight-year deal to air the Globes, beginning with the 2019 ceremony, left the door open to a return of the telecast.<br />“We continue to believe that the HFPA is committed to meaningful reform. However, change of this magnitude takes time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. As such, NBC will not air the 2022 Golden Globes. Assuming the organization executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023,” NBC said in a statement.<br />“Regardless of the next air date of the Golden Globes, implementing transformational changes as quickly—and as thoughtfully—as possible remains the top priority for our organization,” HFPA board members said in a statement Monday. “We invite our partners in the industry to the table to work with us on the systemic reform that is long overdue, both in our organization as well as within the industry at large.” The organization has an estimated 87 members.<br />NBC’s announcement comes amid boycotts of the HFPA by major studios, including  Amazon  and  Netflix ,  and WarnerMedia.</td>

The organization created the malicious computer code that resulted in the shutdown, officials said.<br />“The FBI confirms that the DarkSide ransomware is responsible for the compromise of the Colonial Pipeline networks,” an Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman said Monday. “We continue to work with the company and our government partners on the investigation.”<br />The hack of Colonial Pipeline Co., disclosed over the weekend, has prompted intense concern among senior U.S. officials within the Biden administration, many of whom have already viewed ransomware as a digital blight capable of jeopardizing national and economic security. Ransomware is a practice hackers use to lock up computer systems and demand a payment from victims for their release.<br />Speaking briefly Monday, Mr. Biden said ransomware was a growing problem in need of a global response and said more investment in critical infrastructure was necessary to safeguard critical systems from debilitating cyberattacks.</td>

The attack on a school in Kabul over the weekend is a likely preview.<br />Even in Afghanistan, Saturday’s bombings stood out as particularly depraved. It began when a suicide bomber detonated a car at the gates of a mixed-gender school. As surviving students fled, two more bombs exploded nearby. This left more than 80 dead and nearly twice as many wounded.<br />The bombings were timed to ensure that schoolgirls, who attend classes on a different schedule than boys, were the primary victims. And it’s no accident that the attack took place in a predominantly Shiite Hazara part of Kabul. Religious minorities and women were among those who suffered the most under Taliban rule in the 1990s. They won’t fare any better if the group retakes control of the country.<br />Expect even more violence as U.S. and allied forces complete their withdrawal sometime this summer: Attacks on girls for going to school and on religious minorities simply for existing, and terrorist violence to scare anyone who thinks of resisting.<br />After the weekend bombings the U.S.-backed government in Kabul blamed the Taliban, which blamed Islamic State’s Afghan affiliate. These extremist organizations have clashed in the past, but the Afghan government accuses them of coordinating attacks on the capital. Some have argued that the Taliban would control Islamic State. Good luck with that.</td>

The variant has already spread to more than 30 countries, according to the WHO, including the U.S., the U.K., France and Japan.<br />The surge in India rose rapidly last month, overwhelming hospitals in the country’s hardest-hit cities. Anecdotally speaking, “the pattern now is that one person in the family gets it, the whole family seems to get it,” said Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO’s chief scientist, in an interview. “This is unlike the first wave. And so I think what we’re seeing is more transmissible.”<br />The variant became the fourth so classified by the WHO.

      <td><br /><br /><br />New records by St. Vincent, the project of 38-year-old singer-songwriter Annie Clark, are one part of a larger multimedia work. Like David Bowie, one of her influences, Ms. Clark views each album as an opportunity to present a new persona, with songs linked by in-jokes and references. As an artist, she favors complexity. Her melodies are always a little knotty, the production has two or three more layers than some might find advisable. And her music smacks of effort. You can hear the strain in her voice and in her arrangements as she tries to squeeze things in. Ms. Clark’s songs sound built rather than channeled, and they rarely go down easy. On 2017’s “Masseduction” she collaborated with Jack Antonoff—the busy songwriter and producer who has worked closely with Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey and Lorde, among others—but she certainly wasn’t doing so hoping to make the pop charts. That record hit No. 10, her highest placement so far, but she’ll never quite swim with the mainstream.<br />In press notes and early interviews the sixth St. Vincent album, “Daddy’s Home” (Loma Vista), out Friday, is described as especially personal, though we’ve heard that before. She is not a confessional artist, and she builds her creative worlds from the ground up. This time, however, the record comes with a highly specific backstory: Ms. Clark’s father served nine years in prison for financial crimes and was released in 2019. But a few details aside, the record isn’t “about” his imprisonment or the relationship between father and daughter. Rather, the event gives her license to explore a world of sin, cheap thrills, regret and, here and there, redemption.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden pushed back Monday against Republicans and business groups who say enhanced jobless benefits are discouraging Americans from working, defending his economic prescriptions and saying his administration would make clear that people can’t turn down suitable jobs and keep collecting benefits, except in specific circumstances.<br />“I never said and no serious analyst ever suggested that climbing out of the deep, deep hole our economy was in would be simple, easy, immediate or perfectly steady,” Mr. Biden said at the White House Monday.<br />The U.S. economy is poised for rapid growth this year as vaccination rates climb and consumer and business activity picks up, spurred in part by a flood of federal aid. But Friday’s lackluster employment report has fueled concerns among policy makers that a shortage of workers could restrain the pace of the recovery.<br />U.S. employers added a seasonally adjusted 266,000 jobs in April, the Labor Department said, a sharp slowdown from the previous month and well below the one million jobs economists expected to see. A separate report showed there were 7.4 million unfilled jobs in the U.S.<br />Republicans on Capitol Hill have argued enhanced benefits for unemployed workers are holding back the recovery by making it harder for businesses to fill openings, especially in low-wage sectors where the benefits may be bigger than the paycheck. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week called on Congress to end the extra payments now, several months before they are set to expire.</td>

      <td>Fuel prices are already high, for reasons unrelated to gasoline supply. The pipeline’s shutdown could mean an expensive summer for drivers.</td>
      <td>There is no good time for a major fuel conduit, such as Colonial Pipeline’s, to go out of service. But with the newly vaccinated U.S. population ready to get out and travel, this is a lousy one.<br />The 5,500-mile artery, which carries roughly 45% of the gasoline and diesel fuel consumed on the East Coast, shut down on Friday after a ransomware attack—the type in which attackers gain control of systems and demand payment in return for unlocking the victim’s networks and data.<br />The attack’s impact will depend on how long the disruption lasts. If the pipeline is up and running by Wednesday, it won’t be significant or lasting, said Roger Read, equity analyst at Wells Fargo, in a report. That is because refiners typically have some crude oil and refined product inventory on hand.<br />A longer outage has the potential to increase already-high fuel prices as the industry resorts to more expensive workarounds with limited capacity. One immediate option is relying more on East Coast refining capacity. The share price of  PBF Energy ,  which has refineries in the East Coast, rose as much as 4.3% on Monday. That is only a limited option because the majority of U.S. refineries are on the Gulf Coast. Another option is sourcing locally through rail and road, though both have limited capacity. Ships could provide supplies, but the number of available vessels is constrained by the Jones Act, which bars foreign-flagged ships from moving between U.S. ports. Another alternative is sourcing refined products from Europe.<br />Just as Americans gear up for summer travel, U.S. retail gasoline prices are already around the highest they have been in three years, according to data from GasBuddy. Gasoline cracks—or the difference between the price of crude oil and the price of gasoline—touched multiyear highs in recent weeks, according to a recent report from BofA Global Research. Compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets annual quotas for the quantity of ethanol and biodiesel that must be blended into fuels, has been the main driver of that price surge, analysts have said. But if the pipeline disruption lasts longer, it would start tightening inventory levels as well. As of last week, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed that U.S. gasoline inventory was at 235.8 million barrels, which is at the lower end of the five-year range.</td>

In April, Democratic lawmakers also sent Mr. Zuckerberg a letter criticizing the plan.<br />Facebook now prohibits children under the age of 13 from joining its apps and websites, but Mr. Zuckerberg has acknowledged that many children join by lying about their age.<br />A Facebook spokesman said Monday that the company would work with regulators and lawmakers as its plans for the Instagram children’s version evolve. The company hasn’t said when it would launch the service.</td>

The daily rate of Covid-19 symptomatic infections has jumped to more than 300 cases, bringing the cumulative total to 8,172 and forcing the government to reinstitute lockdown measures.<br />Although that number is low, it is an outsize problem for a tiny geographically isolated nation with a population of just 100,000. The daily case rate is a higher number of infections per capita than India’s outbreak.<br />On Sunday, with hospitals in the capital Victoria overwhelmed with patients, the health ministry issued guidelines on how people who have tested positive for Covid-19 should treat themselves from home while the government scrambles to build more makeshift treatment centers.<br />The islands’ renewed infection surge comes as a shock after the government vaccinated more than 60% of the population. Some 38,000 of the population was given the shot from Chinese state-owned firm Sinopharm and the remainder received  AstraZeneca  shots produced at the Serum Institute of India.</td>

The size of Elliott’s position couldn’t be learned.<br />Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke, which has a market value of around $79 billion and some $55 billion of long-term debt, provides electricity to nearly eight million customers in six states including the Carolinas, some Midwestern states and Florida. It distributes natural gas to 1.6 million customers in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and the Carolinas.<br />In recent months, Moody’s Investors Service and others have lowered Duke’s long-term debt rating, partly in response to the recent settlement of litigation concerning the cleanup of ash from the company’s coal-fired plants.<br />Duke in a written statement didn’t comment on Elliott’s stake but cited its “strong progress over the last year that has cleared a path forward for growth, resolved equity needs at a premium valuation, settled rate cases and coal ash litigation, and accelerated our clean energy transformation, all of which has led us to increase our long-term EPS growth rate and outperform the S&P Utility Index.”</td>

It runs from the Gulf Coast to Linden, N.J.<br />It isn’t the first cyberattack that  the U.S. energy industry has suffered, but it is a dramatic example of what can happen when malicious software affects the computer systems of an energy company.

The authors point to a Canadian study written by economists instead of looking to U.S. research by those who study child development and education. As a parent and pastor who values the foundation my university-educated children received attending a state-licensed child-care center, I don’t look to economists for child-development expertise.<br />As a community member I have come alongside low-income working families to help them apply for child-care programs sponsored by federal and state governments, only to find out there are not nearly enough spots to meet demand, transportation is often an obstacle and the half-day program offered doesn’t help parents who are at work all day.<br />Less than half of eligible children have access to pre-K programs in their communities. Longitudinal studies point to the value and effectiveness in quality early childhood education to affect children’s cognitive, emotional and social development. I have personally helped families transition their young children from a neighbor’s apartment where they were watching television for hours on end while their parents were at work, to child-care classrooms where they are engaged in developmentally appropriate care.<br />The Biden administration’s plan to expand child care isn’t compulsory.

      <td>Readers react to Biden’s targeting of like-kind exchanges.</td>
      <td>Regarding “New Proposal Takes Aim at Real-Estate Tax Loophole” (U.S. News, April 29): A 1031 like-kind exchange has never been a tax loophole. Like-kind exchanges allow investors to exchange one property for another similar “like-kind” property and pay gains taxes later when the property is liquidated. Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code is an established statute as legislated by Congress originally as part of the Revenue Act of 1921. Like-kind exchanges facilitate the overall flow of the real-estate-investment industry, with about 15% of all commercial-real-estate transactions in the U.S. being like-kind transactions. Additionally, those who rely most on section 1031 aren’t large corporations, but individual Americans who own investment property, from urban apartments to farms to forests.<br />According to a study by Profs. David C. Ling and Milena Petrova, nearly 88% of exchanged properties are sold after one round, often resulting in higher paid tax amounts over time than would have otherwise been due. This reinvestment accelerates the velocity of money and prevents extended holding periods that lead to stagnation. Furthermore, the study states that the repeal of section 1031 would harm tenants, property owners and the economy overall with a decrease in real-estate prices and long-term rent increases, to name a few.<br />John Harrison, DBA<br />Alternative & Direct Investment Securities Association<br />Indianapolis</td>

      <td>HHS uses authority under Title IX of Civil Rights Act, cites Supreme Court ruling last year prohibiting discrimination against LGBT workers</td>
      <td>The Biden administration said it would enforce legal protections against discrimination for gay and transgender patients seeking healthcare under the Affordable Care Act, reversing a Trump-era policy that sought to more narrowly define the scope of sex discrimination under the health law.<br />The Department of Health and Human Services said Monday that the administration was using its authority under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act to enforce the ACA’s prohibition based on sex discrimination. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said the department’s decision was based on a Supreme Court ruling last year that allows the agency to interpret the antidiscrimination section of the ACA, which bans bias “on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability,” in a more expansive way.<br />The Supreme Court ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County said a bedrock federal civil-rights law prohibited employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The 6-3 opinion, by Justice Neil Gorsuch, rejected administration arguments that federal civil rights law provides no protection to LGBT employees.<br />“Fear of discrimination can lead individuals to forgo care, which can have serious negative health consequences,” Mr. Becerra said. “It is the position of the Department of Health and Human Services that everyone—including LGBTQ people—should be able to access healthcare, free from discrimination or interference, period.”<br />That section of the healthcare law concerning discrimination has been the source of debate in recent years. In 2016, a federal judge in Texas said the law didn’t extend civil-rights protections to transgender people.</td>

      <td>After the trauma of the presidential election and its aftermath, watching election results out of Britain can feel like a soothing exercise in escapism into a gentler and weirder world of Anglo-Saxon politics.<br />With place names out of Harry Potter, characters out of P.G. Wodehouse, and intertwined political and personal narratives out of Anthony Trollope, politics over there can look like a plotline of semifictional idiosyncrasy. That its leading protagonist is a prime minister of distinctly Falstaffian manner only adds to the general sense of a country inhabiting a political imaginarium.<br />But for all the national eccentricities, the deeper trends at work in British politics have global resonances—not least for bemused observers on this side of the Atlantic.<br />The U.K. remains culturally and politically the closest nation on earth to the U.S., and the larger trends at work over there—pandemic and postpandemic governance; the path to economic recovery; the rapidly shifting alignments of two-party politics and the intensifying culture wars over identity, history and social cohesion—carry distinct echoes over here.<br />So when Brits went to the polls last week, the results demand some scrutiny. Because last year’s local elections were postponed on account of the pandemic, this was the first nationwide election since December 2019, when Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party returned with a thumping majority. Voters across almost the entire U.K. got a chance to participate in something like a U.S. midterm election.</td>

Yet in making the accusation in an April 27 report, the group brazenly acknowledges that it has “detached the term apartheid from its original South African context.”<br />This is immoral. “Apartheid” has a sacred historical meaning, sanctified by the blood and suffering of millions of South Africans who were oppressed and discriminated against on the basis of race. In appropriating the word, Human Rights Watch presents a grotesquely distorted picture of both South African history and the current reality in Israel.<br />Apartheid was a state-enforced national system of racial discrimination that manifested in a slew of oppressive laws aimed at obliterating the human rights of an entire race—among them the Population Registration Act, the Group Areas Act, and the Separate Amenities Act. Black South Africans were denied the vote and equality before the law until 1994.<br />In contrast, within the borders of the state of Israel, all citizens—Jews, Arabs or otherwise—have the right to vote and complete equality before the law. They participate side by side in elections, and Israeli Arabs hold high-ranking positions throughout the Israeli government, including the Knesset and the Supreme Court. After the recent election, an Arab-led party holds the balance of power in the Knesset, and it was an Arab judge that convicted former Israeli president Moshe Katzav.</td>

      <td>For the second time in three years, the Kentucky Derby winner might not be the first horse that crossed the finish line. Now the question is whether Medina Spirit will be allowed to run in Saturday’s Preakness Stakes after a failed drug test put its Kentucky Derby win in peril.<br />Medina Spirit held off Mandaloun by a half-length to win the 147th running of the Kentucky Derby on May 1. But on Sunday, trainer Bob Baffert revealed that Medina Spirit had failed a post-race drug test, which could ultimately lead to the horse’s disqualification. In 2019, Maximum Security was disqualified after veering off course and impeding two rivals during the race.<br />Baffert said Medina Spirit was found to have 21 picograms of betamethasone, which is twice the legal threshold allowed in Kentucky. Betamethasone is a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation and joint pain in horses. Baffert denied wrongdoing and said that “at no point in time, has anyone in my barn or any of my veterinarians” administered betamethasone to Medina Spirit.<br />According to Kentucky regulations, the horse won’t be disqualified until a split sample—collected at the same time as the first sample—confirms the initial test result. The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission didn’t respond to a request for comment on when the split sample results would be available but it isn’t expected until after the Preakness. In a statement,  Churchill Downs  said that if the findings are upheld, Medina Spirit’s win would be invalidated and Mandaloun declared the winner.<br />The situation forces organizers of the Preakness at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore to make a decision on whether to allow Medina Spirit to run before the investigation in Kentucky is fully completed. The post-position draw for the second leg of the Triple Crown was initially set to take place on Monday but was postponed until Tuesday afternoon.</td>

Mr. Ryan became Speaker but he, too, eventually left Congress in frustration. Mr. Cantor was beaten in a Republican primary by a tea party upstart.<br />That left Mr. McCarthy, who today is the top House Republican.

Installing more efficient lighting, heating and cooling systems are proven ways to cut energy usage and emissions. Integrating them into “smart” digital systems offers additional gains, though it can be complex.<br />Buildings can generate their own energy, cut bills and reduce emissions with rooftop solar panels, and combining them with storage batteries builds resilience to power cuts. Local solar installations also avoid the costs and power loss associated with transmission lines and face fewer permitting hurdles than stand-alone solar farms.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration plans to revive an immigration program that lets foreign entrepreneurs work in the U.S. by withdrawing a Trump administration proposal that aimed to kill the program.<br />The International Entrepreneur rule, proposed by President Obama’s administration three days before he left office in 2017, allows foreign entrepreneurs to work in the country for up to five years, so long as their startups attract at least $250,000 in U.S. venture capital, hire 10 employees or meet other benchmarks.<br />The Trump administration opposed the program because it relies on an authority known as parole, which allows the U.S. to let in foreigners without visas so long as there is a “significant public benefit.” It published a notice saying it intended to terminate the program, though it ultimately never did. The program withered anyway because startup founders and venture-capital firms interpreted the notice as a sign the Trump administration wouldn’t approve applications.<br />The Biden administration plans to market the program as part of its efforts to revive it. Those moves respond to requests from venture-capital firms, which want the administration to put resources behind a program that could allow thousands of foreign startup founders to move to or remain in the U.S. to grow their businesses.<br />“Immigrants in the United States have a long history of entrepreneurship, hard work, and creativity, and their contributions to this nation are incredibly valuable,” said Acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Tracy Renaud.</td>

      <td>JERUSALEM—Fresh clashes broke out between Israeli police and Palestinians at a flashpoint holy site in Jerusalem on Monday, exacerbating tensions ahead of a planned Jewish nationalist march that passes through Muslim areas of the Old City.<br />At least 180 people were injured as the police fired flash grenades, tear gas and sponge tipped bullets at Palestinian worshipers at the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, according to Palestinian medics and social media videos. Israeli police said they used riot control methods after hundreds of Palestinians began throwing stones and shooting fireworks at them near an entrance to the site.<br />The compound has become a focal point of Palestinian anger over what they see as years of efforts to push them out of Jerusalem and limit their access to land they claim, as well as infringe on their basic rights. The situation has been aggravated by right-wing Jewish Israeli efforts to assert control in East Jerusalem, which Israel claims as part of its undivided capital.<br />Earlier Monday, Israeli police restricted Jewish visitors to the holy site complex—known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary—which has long been a source of conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.<br />Monday’s violence comes after days of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police amid tensions over a looming court decision on whether to evict Palestinians from their homes in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. Israel’s Supreme Court delayed a planned Monday hearing on the evictions, owing in part to the heightened political tensions associated with the decision.</td>

      <td>Tiered commissions may be more of a deal for delivery platforms than the restaurants they serve</td>
      <td>After a very hard year for U.S. restaurants, food-delivery platforms appear to be giving them a break. They aren’t expecting to make any less money, though.<br />Last month,  DoorDash  publicly introduced a three-tiered commission structure for U.S. restaurant partners. And while it hasn’t made a formal announcement,  Uber Technologies ’ Uber Eats also has been experimenting with similar tiered structures domestically for months.<br />Delivery platforms say tiered plans are meant to give restaurants more options. They could use the goodwill. Having long argued against steep fees, regulators have implemented temporary commission caps across many urban and suburban areas over the past year. Data show food-delivery platforms added fewer restaurants between April and December last year amid the pandemic than they did during the same months in 2019.<br />Some of that has to do with restaurants’ pinched budgets. But it is also likely because the common practice of adding restaurants to platforms without explicit agreements has fallen out of favor. In California, platforms now need agreements in place with restaurants to deliver their food. Delivery workers often showed up and crowded kitchens unexpectedly, while delivery platforms received orders for items restaurants no longer served. This was a problem more broadly last year when restaurants unexpectedly closed to cut costs, unbeknown to delivery platforms still listing their menus.<br />The bet on tiered pricing has to be that options are more palatable for restaurants initially, opening the door for an upsell down the road. DoorDash’s new tiers start as low as 15% of the order—a far cry from the 30%-plus that some restaurants have reported paying for services in the past. But for a restaurant looking for a plan that includes comprehensive discovery and delivery services, not all options make sense. DoorDash itself has said it expects most restaurants to opt for its most expensive tier.</td>

      <td>Value stocks are outperforming pricier growth stocks by the greatest margin in over a decade</td>
      <td>Value stocks globally have just recorded their strongest short-term performance against growth stocks in over a decade. In a market riddled with signs of froth and euphoria, that’s a healthy development.<br />The MSCI All Country World Value Index—heavy on less-expensive financial, healthcare and industrial stocks—is beating its growth-stocks equivalent by 11.3 percentage points over the past 12 weeks. That’s its biggest advantage since mid-2009, when the equity market was climbing off the floor following the global financial crisis.<br />Of course, that follows last year’s even-larger outperformance by richly valued growth stocks, the greatest since the heat of the dot-com bubble. In general, growth stocks—led not just by the U.S. FAANG set but also the emerging Chinese tech sector—have trounced their more staid peers globally over the last decade.<br />There is no magic formula that says value and growth stocks must equilibrate. Tech stocks carry a premium price, but the companies are experiencing tremendous earnings growth. Still, after last year’s rally, a period of rebalancing would be positive for the market in general, making it less dependent on a handful of high-price names.<br />Bank of America analysts see an analogy with the rotation toward value after the internet stock bubble burst in 2000. But there is a clear difference so far: Broad stock indexes both in the U.S. and the rest of the world in aggregate are still at or near record highs.</td>

      <td>Politics and capacity constraints are behind the surge in iron ore prices but neither will necessarily play out how investors think</td>
      <td>Iron ore prices have jumped to new highs on steel supply concerns in China—and politics. That might not last.<br />Iron ore futures on China’s Dalian exchange rose 10%—the daily trading limit—Monday to a record high. The rally comes against the backdrop of buoyant commodity markets. Copper prices, for example, have also notched record highs as the metal is seen as a beneficiary of the transition to renewables and electric vehicles. Goldman Sachs analysts called the red metal the “new oil” last month.<br />Concerns about supply seem to have driven the latest gains in iron ore. China indefinitely suspended a strategic economic dialogue with Australia on Thursday, signaling no end in sight for the worsening relationship between the two countries. Australia is by far the world’s largest iron ore producer while China is the biggest consumer. Last week, China also stepped up measures to curb capacity at local steel mills to prevent “blind investment.” The expectation is that this could drive stockpiling of iron ore and steel before the coming restrictions kick in.<br />The short-term supply and demand situation for many commodities is indeed out of kilter, partly because of the pandemic. The supply disruptions caused by Covid-19 and heavy rainfall, for example, have affected iron ore production in Brazil, the second-largest iron ore producer. Demand, however, has remained strong in China, which has recovered from the pandemic.<br />The imbalance might linger for a while, but a fundamental shift toward a tighter Chinese market over the long run looks more questionable. If futures prices are moving higher because investors expect Aussie iron ore to become scarce on the mainland for political reasons, they will probably be disappointed.</td>

Copper, a cog of industry found throughout the home and in electronics, hit record prices Friday. Crude oil hasn’t cost so much since 2018 and soybeans are trading at their loftiest level since 2012.<br />With corn climbing toward a record, Americans can expect to pay more for all sorts of items at the grocery store as well as at the gasoline pump. Corn is a key ingredient in making products ranging from tortilla chips and chicken wings to bourbon and  Coca-Cola .  About 40% of the U.S. crop is blended into motor fuel.<br />Analysts say high corn prices are lifting makers of fertilizer and farm equipment while helping consumer products and food companies justify their own price increases. U.S. farmers, who are seeding fields for a big autumn harvest, are also benefiting.</td>

      <td>Investors balance robust economic recovery with China trade tensions and impact of border closures</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—Australia’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has passed another milestone with its benchmark share index closing at a record high, its first in 15 months.<br />The S&P/ ASX  200 index lifted 1.3% to 7172.8 on Monday after another rise in iron-ore prices drove demand for shares in mining companies including  BHP Group Ltd.  and  Rio Tinto  PLC. The index beat its previous record of 7162.5 set on Feb. 20, 2020, and continued a comeback that began on March 24 last year when the index had languished below 4550.<br />For investors, it hasn’t been a smooth ride. Early in the pandemic, Australia’s economy was exposed to a rapid slowing in global demand that threatened its exports of industrial commodities such as iron ore and coal. Investors had to navigate trade tensions with China, which followed Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s call for an international investigation into the origins of Covid-19, and the impact of Australia’s border closure on tourism and education.<br />However, Australia’s success in crushing the coronavirus—it has recorded fewer than 30,000 cases since the pandemic began—and the central bank’s lowering of interest rates to record lows as part of its pandemic response made equities increasingly attractive. The economy has also emerged from recession with its fastest growth rebound in 70 years, helped by government stimulus programs.<br />Overseas moves have further helped to stoke demand for Australian equities. China’s investment in infrastructure to drive its own economic recovery has pushed prices of iron ore, Australia’s top export, to a record high above $200 a metric ton. Accelerating vaccine rollouts in the U.S. and Europe have fueled a greater appetite for risk.</td>

The Western province has attracted attention from public-health experts in Canada and abroad, with many saying decisive actions by the provincial government in recent weeks helped slow the spread, alleviating stress on the healthcare system and reducing the overall Covid-19 caseload.<br />Experts said British Columbia’s strategy focused in part on traditional methods of dealing with Covid-19, such as banning indoor dining and placing further limits on indoor fitness activities.<br />“I think that [British Columbia] did a really good job of combining effective nonpharmaceutical interventions with the vaccination strategy of getting vaccines to as many people as possible,” said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious-diseases physician and co-director of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “It’s an important lesson showing that the tools that we already have at our disposal…also work against P.1 and even some of the more concerning variants.”<br />The P.1 variant is a strain of the Covid-19 virus that is estimated to be as much as 2.2 times more contagious and as much as 61% more capable of reinfecting people compared with previous versions of the coronavirus, according to studies in Brazil. P.1 is believed to be a major factor in the surge of Covid-19 cases in Brazil earlier this year and, more recently, across South America, making many younger people gravely ill.</td>

Order books, which track demand for new bonds and help determine the prices, have ballooned since hedge funds began to pile into this trade.<br />The debt-management offices of Spain and Italy have placed caps ranging from 500 million euros to 1 billion euros, equivalent to $608 million to $1.2 billion, on orders from hedge funds for bonds directly issued by countries in the primary market, according to bankers who worked on the deals. France has also limited order sizes, an official said.<br />Millennium Management, Brevan Howard, DoubleLine, Tenaron Capital Management and BlueBay Asset Management are among the hedge funds that have been active in the primary market for sovereign bonds in recent months, according to bankers.

Countries issuing bonds typically seek to avoid investors with a short-term horizon. That is because hot money flowing quickly in and out of their debt can make prices volatile and potentially drive away other buyers, which could increase their borrowing costs.</td>

Power. It also was the first time ever that the average used-car price had exceeded $25,000, the firm said.<br />The climb, which began last year, has surprised some dealers who say they don’t see the trend ending soon.<br />“What is normally a depreciable asset has been appreciating,” said Phil Maguire, who owns Maguire Family Dealerships, a group of 13 stores in New York state. “It’s certainly surreal, and I guess we can all agree that it’s an anomaly.” Dealers say they are having to pay more to keep their lots stocked.<br />The surge is being driven in part by the global chip shortage, which is straining inventories on the new-car side and leading more consumers to shop the preowned market. At the same time, used-car supplies were tight heading into the year because people were hanging on to their leased vehicles longer, according to analysts, executives and dealers. Rental-car companies also had pared back their fleets early in the pandemic, leaving them with fewer vehicles to sell later in the year.</td>

His illness brought new urgency to succession planning on the part of both Mr. Swensen and Yale.<br />In the years after his diagnosis, Mr. Swensen gave regular updates on his health to Yale’s investment committee. He also kept and regularly revised a list of potential successors. He discussed what he viewed as their strengths and weaknesses with people who will play a role in determining who gets the job, including Yale President Peter Salovey and some members of the endowment’s investment committee, said some of the people.<br />Some of these candidates work at the Yale Investments Office, as the endowment is known, while others were external candidates. Mr. Swensen’s thoughts are expected to inform how Yale’s leadership weighs how to replace the unofficial dean of endowment investing.<br />Yale on Friday said it would announce a process for appointing a new investment chief; the people familiar with the matter said Yale plans to conduct a search. University trustees recognize that the role will evolve with a new investment chief, said one of the people. Still, the person said trustees believe Mr. Swensen built an endowment culture and framework that will endure.</td>

The company didn’t release any information regarding the cost of the project and the scale of government support.<br />The fact that it is likely to take two years to set up the production line underlines the complexity of manufacturing the so-called mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. The companies have pointed to this complexity as an argument against waiving the patent on their shot for it to be manufactured in developing countries, a move the U.S. is pushing for.<br />BioNTech, a small German drugmaker focused on cancer treatments, came up with the first coronavirus vaccine to be approved in the U.S. and Europe. BioNTech and Pfizer market the shot together, except in Germany, Turkey and China, where BioNTech operates alone.<br />The company said in a written statement that it selected Singapore for its regional headquarters and would build a highly automated mRNA manufacturing site for vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases and cancer.</td>

Star is offering 2.68 of its own shares in exchange for every Crown share and a cash option of A$12.50 per share for up to 25% of Crown’s shares on issue.<br />Blackstone, which already has real-estate assets in Australia and a gambling footprint in other countries, such as the Cosmopolitan casino and resort in Las Vegas, has also increased its bid, Crown said. Blackstone is now offering A$12.35 per share for Crown, up from a proposal worth A$11.85 per share, with the increased bid valuing Crown at roughly $6.5 billion. Blackstone already owns nearly 10% of Crown, making it the second biggest shareholder.<br />A Blackstone representative didn’t have an immediate comment on Star’s bid.

II .  Benson Hill says it can develop breeds of crops like soybeans and yellow peas that mature faster, have higher protein content or taste better, saving growers time and resources.<br />Such ingredients are key for plant-based meat alternatives, and the company is also developing products for animal feed.

It also has a unit that sells fresh produce to grocery stores and food distributors. The roughly $625 million in expected cash proceeds from the deal will accelerate Benson Hill’s bid to bring down plant-based food costs, Chief Executive Matt Crisp said in an interview.<br />“It’s positioning us to really gear shift into another level of growth,” he said.</td>

Corral.” He may want to retire that analogy because the city’s streets are looking more like Tombstone all the time despite having one of the nation’s strictest gun laws.<br />The mayhem made it to Times Square on Saturday as a gunman shot three innocent bystanders at about 5 p.m., including a four-year-old girl. All three survived. Wendy Magrinat, 23, who was visiting from Rhode Island with her two-year-old and husband, was shot in the thigh.<br />She told the New York Post that she and her family were waiting in line to enter a store when she became aware of men arguing and the shooting began. Here’s a way to attract tourists to the city as the pandemic eases: Come to Times Square on Mother’s Day weekend, and maybe you too can get shot.<br />Similar incidents are multiplying across the city as politicians have vilified police and made it hard for cops to stop and frisk potential suspects for illegal firearms. The New York Police Department reported that shootings tripled in the week before last to 42 incidents. Police figures show shootings are up 83.3% so far this year, and 93.5% over 2019.<br />The evidence is undeniable that New York is trending back to the high-crime days before Rudy Giuliani became mayor in 1994. That was the era when a police precinct in the Bronx was known as Fort Apache. Mr. Giuliani and successor Mike Bloomberg cleaned up the city’s streets, including Times Square. Now the area is beset again by the homeless, panhandlers, and too often criminals.</td>

      <td>A new study finds more virus spread inside homes than work places.</td>
      <td>Covid-19 lockdowns shaved 3.5% off U.S. GDP in 2020 even as the federal government spent more than $2.6 trillion in relief measures. Millions of children fell behind in learning and nearly 100,000 businesses closed for good.<br />Conventional wisdom holds this was worth it because lives were saved by shutting workplaces and schools and telling people to stay home. But a new study by University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan shows the opposite. After the first month of the pandemic, organizations that adopted prevention protocols became safer places than the wider community. Officials who didn’t see that coming forgot that organizations are rational and look for cooperative solutions that improve the welfare of the group, such as reducing the risks of communicable disease.<br />In “The Backward Art of Slowing the Spread? Congregation Efficiencies during COVID-19,” Mr. Mulligan uses empirical data to test the presumption that the workplace was less safe than the home. He recognizes that “absent costly prevention activities, larger groups naturally have more infections per member.”<br />Yet as he notes, people join firms “in part because they value the group’s management of local externalities and public goods.” That’s an economist’s way of saying that the human capital of a company is tied to its capacity to protect employees and serve customers.<br />There is little doubt that infection would spread faster in congregations than in smaller groups if both engaged in similar practices. But since larger groups have an incentive to spend on expensive methods of prevention, larger organizations might be better at prevention than households with fewer people.</td>

So far, no evidence has emerged that the attackers penetrated the vital control systems that run the pipeline, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />But the consequences of an infection spreading to that deeper layer are dire for any energy company. Many machines that control pipelines, refineries and power plants are well past their prime, have few protections against sophisticated attacks and could be manipulated to muck with equipment or cause damage, cybersecurity experts say.<br />Last year, a ransomware attack moved from a natural-gas company’s networks into the control systems at a compression facility, halting operations for two days, according to a Department of Homeland Security alert. The company, which Homeland Security didn’t name, didn’t have a plan to respond to a cyberattack, the agency said.<br />The Colonial ransomware attack is a high-profile example of the online assaults that U.S. companies, schools, hospitals and other organizations now face regularly. It should also serve as a wake-up call for the energy industry’s particular exposure, according to consultants and others who work with companies to shore up cybersecurity.</td>

      <td>The president can’t afford to ignore trade, lest friends in Asia conclude they should work with China.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s new international policy is missing one big pillar: trade. The administration would like to dodge the politics; Democrats have only a narrow majority in Congress, and the party includes many economic isolationists. But America can’t afford to drop out of the competition to write the world’s new trade rules and commercial designs.<br />North America is an immediate opportunity. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Nafta rewrite, enables Americans to challenge labor conditions in individual Mexican plants. The administration could use this power to help build honest Mexican unions—or as an excuse to block exports from America’s southern neighbor. The new infrastructure bill should include “Buy North America” procurement rules to lower costs, fight uncompetitive bid-rigging, and encourage reciprocity. U.S. and Canadian steelworkers share the same union, so they should support continental cooperation. Washington could also lower the soaring costs of home construction by removing penalty tariffs on Canadian lumber.<br />As companies redirect supply chains, the U.S. should make it easier to shift production from China to Mexico. Canadian railways are competing to buy  Kansas City Southern  to streamline the continent’s transport network; Mr. Biden’s team should expedite border and regulatory procedures to capitalize on such private investment.<br />The president knows that Central Americans will keep fleeing north if they are fearful and desperate at home. In addition to assisting with security and the rule of law, the administration should expand provisions in the U.S.-Central American free-trade agreement of 2005 that encourage the region’s cross-border investment and production with Mexico.<br />The U.S. will never compete economically with China in Asia if Americans don’t show up to design regional trade policies. China and 14 other countries have agreed on a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that lowers trade barriers and establishes common rules of origin. Both China and Britain aspire to join the higher-quality Trans-Pacific Partnership, an 11-nation pact based on U.S. standards. But President Trump withdrew from the TPP, and Mr. Biden has shrunk from making the case to rejoin.</td>

On his Fox Business show, the former Trump economic adviser lampooned a climate-change study from the University of Michigan, which argues that to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, Americans will have to cut back severely on “red meat, poultry, fish/seafood, eggs, dairy, and animal based fats.” To which Mr. Kudlow quipped: “OK, got that? No burger on July 4. No steaks on the barbecue. I’m sure Middle America is just going to love that. Can you grill those brussels sprouts?”<br />It was funny, but the climate lobby wasn’t laughing. Media “fact checkers” called it a “false story . . . another example of a closed ecosystem of information affecting public opinion,” in the Associated Press’s words. The  New York Times ’s  Paul Krugman tweeted: “This is what right-wing politics is down to. It’s all false claims about evil liberals, which the base is expected to believe because it’s primed to believe in liberal villainy.”<br />Hold on a minute. Liberals constantly insist they “follow the science.” Apparently “the science” says if we don’t stop eating meat, cow flatulence will doom the planet. The war on meat is no figment of the right’s imagination.<br />It’s true Joe Biden hasn’t stated he wants to curtail meat production or consumption. But people he listens to have. During a CNN “Climate Crisis Town Hall,” Kamala Harris was asked if she favored changing “dietary guidelines to reduce the consumption of red meat in light of the impact of the climate change.” She said yes: “The balance that we have to strike here, frankly, is about what government can and should do around creating incentives and then banning certain behaviors.”<br />The United Nations Environmental Agency’s newsletter claims that “every bite of burger boosts harmful greenhouse gases.” A tweet from the U.N. last summer warned: “The meat industry is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the world’s biggest oil companies.” Greenpeace asserts on its website that eating meat “makes the planet sick. The livestock sector—raising cows, pigs and chickens—generates as much greenhouse gas emissions as all cars, trucks and automobiles combined.”</td>

      <td>The solution is to ease restrictions on exporting shots and build more production capacity.</td>
      <td>While the U.S. Covid pandemic has been contained, the situation in many countries, particularly India, is dire. It’s essential to get as much of the world vaccinated as quickly as possible to save lives and prevent new variants from emerging. The Biden administration’s support for breaking vaccine patents is a bad precedent that would do no immediate good and substantial long-term harm.<br />There isn’t enough vaccine supply to meet world-wide demand. Many countries have access only to inferior vaccines produced in Russia or China. Understandably, they want the same safe and effective vaccines that are available to Americans. By the end of 2022, U.S. manufacturers will produce more than 12 billion doses of high-quality vaccines, enough to satisfy global needs. And other vaccine candidates are in the pipeline and may be authorized over the next year. But over the next six months, global supply will remain tight.<br />The Biden administration caved to pressure at the World Trade Organization to support waiving intellectual-property protections for Covid vaccines. Some activists have declared victory, even though patent breaking wouldn’t solve the immediate problem and could make a global agreement much more difficult. France, Germany and the U.K. all oppose the idea, and the WTO should reject it. Here are four productive steps the developed world could take instead:<br />First, the U.S. government should stop hoarding doses and make them available for export. Some of the biggest vaccine makers have shown that their manufacturing is stable and growing. The supply chain is reliable, and the U.S. doesn’t need to stockpile hundreds of millions of doses. More can be made available on a rolling basis to countries like India and Brazil.<br />Second, countries that produce quality vaccines such as Belgium, France, Japan, Australia and the U.K., to name only a few, should invest in a major expansion of manufacturing facilities and the attendant supply chain, in return for a guarantee that a high percentage of the vaccines that flow from these efforts go to low- and middle-income nations. This would secure stable production and guarantee a steady supply of high-quality vaccines for vulnerable nations.</td>

      <td>From “The Liberals Who Can’t Quit Lockdown” by Emma Green, the Atlantic, May 4:<br /><br />Policy makers’ decisions about how to fight the pandemic are fraught because they have such an impact on people’s lives. But personal decisions during the coronavirus crisis are fraught because they seem symbolic of people’s broader value systems. When vaccinated adults refuse to see friends indoors, they’re working through the trauma of the past year, in which the brokenness of America’s medical system was so evident. When they keep their kids out of playgrounds and urge friends to stay distanced at small outdoor picnics, they are continuing the spirit of the past year, when civic duty has been expressed through lonely asceticism. For many people, this kind of behavior is a form of good citizenship. That’s a hard idea to give up.<br />And so as the rest of vaccinated America begins its summer of bacchanalia, rescheduling long-awaited dinner parties and medium-size weddings, the most hard-core pandemic progressives are left, Cassandra-like, to preach their peers’ folly.</td>

The activity was bolstered in part by investors who were flush with capital thanks to a thriving initial-public-offering market, as well as from strong demand for innovation and digital acceleration amid the pandemic.<br />Here’s a look at what venture capitalists and entrepreneurs see as the biggest trends to look for in the year ahead.<br />Venture capitalists predict another stellar year for raising capital, on the winds of a healthy IPO market and favorable regulatory changes that open doors to new investment.<br />“Venture-fund returns in 2020 were spectacular compared with public-market returns,” says Steven N.

      <td>Inflation is in focus with this week’s round of economic data.<br />China’s factory-gate prices are expected to surge in April. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal are forecasting a rise in the producer-price index of 6.5% from a year earlier, in part because of a low base for comparison—prices sank in April 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic—but also due to rapidly climbing costs for metals, oil and other materials. The country’s consumer-price index is expected to climb for the second consecutive month.<br />The U.K. economy likely contracted in the first quarter after the government in December responded to rising Covid-19 cases with fresh restrictions on social and economic activity. But a strong vaccination campaign and steady reopening of the economy suggest the downturn was short lived. Economists expect growth to return in the second quarter and the Bank of England is forecasting U.K. gross domestic product will grow by 7.25% in 2021.<br />U.S. consumer prices in April are expected to post their largest annual increase in nearly a decade. Costs are rising for goods and services in high demand and short supply, but the figures will also be amplified by the comparison to prices from a year earlier—when the economy was in a pandemic-induced tailspin. Federal Reserve officials are forecasting only temporary inflation pressures, though not all economists agree with the Fed’s benign outlook.<br />U.S. consumer spending jumped in March as federal-stimulus checks sent household incomes soaring. Economists are forecasting more gains in April, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month. Retail sales—a measure of purchases at stores, at restaurants and online—will likely be helped along as Covid-19 related restrictions are relaxed, vaccination campaigns advance and the broader economy expands.</td>

But in some wealthy countries where the supply of those vaccines has been more constrained, AstraZeneca doses have been offered to people as young as 30, showing the wide variation even among wealthy countries in vaccination campaigns.<br />On Friday, the U.K.’s vaccines advisory body said the vaccine produced by AstraZeneca, which has raised concerns among health experts due its possible link to rare blood clots, should preferably not be given to people under 40. Previous guidance suggested the vaccine should preferably not be given to people under 30.<br />In Canada last week, members of a national expert panel referred to the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna as the preferred option after elected officials had earlier encouraged citizens to get the first vaccine available, which for some age groups was AstraZeneca’s shot.<br />Meanwhile, German officials on Thursday took the opposite tack, saying they would make the vaccine available to all adults after earlier limiting it to those 60 years and older, as it sought to speed up a vaccination campaign that had gotten off to a slow start.</td>

The money will help, but it doesn’t obviate the need to scrutinize who will be leading the government’s scientific efforts, as many of us did during President Trump’s term in office. The current emphasis in academic hiring on affirmative action shouldn’t be of concern here. We should expect that merit and accomplishment will guide promotion to the highest levels of scientific leadership. Even if the Biden administration may appear more in touch with the concerns of the scientific community, it isn’t excused from the duty to appoint qualified people to leadership positions.<br />Many don’t realize that the largest funder of physical science in the country isn’t the National Science Foundation, whose 2022 budget the Biden administration has proposed to increase by 20%, but the Energy Department. Here, too, the Biden administration is proposing a major funding increase.<br />The DOE Office of Science’s $7 billion budget, set to rise by $400 million, supports research in high-energy and nuclear physics with large accelerators, materials physics with X-ray synchrotrons, fusion and advanced scientific computers, and runs 10 national laboratories employing thousands of researchers.<br />President Biden has nominated Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, a soil biogeochemist from the University of California, Merced, to lead the Office of Science. Ms. Berhe will be the first black woman to lead the science office, happily lending a more diverse face to science in this country.<br />Ms. Berhe’s research program on soil chemistry, exploring the capture of carbon dioxide, is relevant to climate-change policy. But her research expertise isn’t in any of the Office of Science’s major programs, and she has no experience as a scientific administrator and minimal experience with the Energy Department itself. Past directors have been established researchers from one of the major fields supported by the department, or they have administered large private laboratories like Bell Labs—in line with the demands of the job. It is hard not to wonder whether Ms. Berhe is the right choice for a leadership role at the DOE.</td>

The court said Mr. Mandelblit must decide what role he would play in the case by June 8 and planned May evictions will be suspended meanwhile.<br />Even with the court case delayed, the potential for escalation remains with a show of Jewish right-wing strength that is planned for Monday. Right-wing Jewish Israelis typically march through the Old City, including Muslim areas, waving Israeli flags to mark Israel’s capture of East Jerusalem. The event, an Israeli holiday known as Jerusalem Day, is intended as a show of Israeli claims to the contested city.<br />Israeli police said Sunday the march can go ahead.</td>

The plans would be paid for through increased taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans.<br />On Wednesday, Mr. Biden will hold his first formal meeting since taking office with top congressional leaders: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).

As long as the Republican Party emphasizes social matters that many of the younger generation do not believe in, they will get fewer and fewer votes, as older voters decline in numbers<br />The Republican Party already has voters who vote Republican because of the party’s more conservative social stances.

Republicans should emphasize they are for equality for all, but not artificially imposed quotas when it comes to race or gender; that they are against pitting one race against another; that they are pro-immigration, but immigrants must comply with our laws; that they are against defunding the police so that our cities don’t descend into anarchy; that most police shootings involving minorities are not the result of inherent racism; that they favor free speech and do not condone people being shouted down or fired from their job for expressing opinions others do not agree with.<br />These are ideas that most people, young or old, agree with.

Of course, he and his fellow Senate Democrats have also made Supreme Court nomination hearings a national disgrace. They’re the ones assaulting our judiciary, a co-equal branch of government.<br />Charles D. Eden<br />Atlanta</td>

      <td>Regulator questions payment for order flow, in which firms pay brokers such as Robinhood for opportunity to execute investors’ orders</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The electronic-trading firms Citadel Securities and  Virtu Financial Inc.  have become pillars of the stock market in recent years, rivaling the role played by stock exchanges.<br />Wall Street’s new top regulator is putting pressure on them by questioning a key service they provide: executing the orders of millions of ordinary investors whose trades go to their black boxes, instead of being routed to public exchanges.<br />Testifying before Congress last week, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler criticized the system that funnels orders to Citadel Securities and Virtu, which pay for the opportunity to trade with retail stock and options orders. Mr. Gensler said such incentives—called payment for order flow—represent a conflict of interest for online brokerages, which collectively make billions of dollars a year from the practice. He voiced concern that the trading firms handling most individual investors’ orders control too much of the business.<br />In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Mr. Gensler went further, comparing the retail wholesalers unfavorably with public exchanges whose prices are considered “lit” because they appear publicly for all traders to see.<br />“A lot of these are really just going to the wholesalers, they are not as lit, they’re not as competitive,” he said. “So it’s not as clear we are actually getting best execution in an unlit, internalized wholesaler as contrasted to the lit markets.”</td>

      <td>Kabul residents on Sunday buried dozens of schoolgirls killed by explosions outside a school</td>
      <td>KABUL—Zainab Maqsudi, 13 years old, exited the library and walked toward the main gate of the Sayed Shuhada school to go home on Saturday when she was blown backward by an explosion. When she stood up, the air was thick with dust and smoke, and she was surrounded by shattered glass.<br />“Suicide attack!” everyone yelled, she said, reflecting how common such attacks have become in Afghanistan. She noticed she was bleeding from her arms. An older sister took her to hospital.<br />“I’m not sure if I will go back to school when I recover,” Zainab, who is in seventh grade, said from her hospital bed Sunday, with her parents by her side. “I don’t want to get hurt again. My body shakes when I think about what happened.”<br />Preventing girls like Zainab from going to school was the likely goal of the terrorists behind Saturday’s attack in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Kabul. Widening access to women’s education was one of the most tangible achievements of the 20-year U.S. presence in Afghanistan—progress that could be reversed once American forces leave the country later this year.<br />Afghan authorities on Sunday raised the official death toll from Saturday’s attack that targeted schoolgirls at Sayed Shuhada to 53. It was the latest assault on the area’s mostly Shiite Hazara minority, which in recent months has suffered horrific attacks by Islamic State’s Afghan affiliate, including on a maternity ward and an education center.</td>
