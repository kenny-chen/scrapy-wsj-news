      <td>Microsoft Corp. board members decided that Bill Gates needed to step down from its board in 2020 as they pursued an investigation into the billionaire’s prior romantic relationship with a female Microsoft employee that was deemed inappropriate, people familiar with the matter said.<br />Members of the board tasked with the matter hired a law firm to conduct an investigation in late 2019 after a Microsoft engineer alleged in a letter that she had a sexual relationship over years with Mr. Gates, the people said.<br />During the probe, some board members decided it was no longer suitable for Mr. Gates to sit as a director at the software company he started and led for decades, the people said. Mr. Gates resigned before the board’s investigation was completed and before the full board could make a formal decision on the matter, another person familiar with the matter said.<br />“Microsoft received a concern in the latter half of 2019 that Bill Gates sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000,” a Microsoft spokesman said. “A committee of the Board reviewed the concern, aided by an outside law firm to conduct a thorough investigation. Throughout the investigation, Microsoft provided extensive support to the employee who raised the concern.”<br />A spokeswoman for Mr. Gates said, “There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably.” She said his “decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter. In fact, he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier.”</td>

The merger could be announced as soon as this week.<br />Founded in 2018, Bright Machines says that its “microfactories” can be programmed to complete electronics-manufacturing tasks and continue improving as they repeat them. They make supply chains more efficient, removing the need for as many human workers and saving resources in many technology-dependent industries, the company says.<br />The San Francisco-based company currently has about 25 customers, according to its website. Its existing investors include BMW iVentures—the venture-capital arm of auto maker BMW AG—Eclipse Ventures and Lux Capital.<br />If the deal is completed, Bright Machines would be expected to generate about $435 million in cash proceeds from the roughly $230 million held by the SPAC and $205 million from a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, associated with the merger, the people said.  SoftBank Group Corp.  and Fidelity Investments are expected to participate in the PIPE.</td>

At Home’s shares have been hovering above $36 since, suggesting shareholders expect the price tag could rise.<br />CAS said in the letter the deal “grossly undervalues the company and deprives stockholders of anything resembling a fair premium.” It suggested that a price above $70 a share would be more realistic based on its projections and said it is prepared to try to block the current deal if needed. The deal requires signoff from a majority of its shareholders.<br />At Home sells furniture, décor and other home goods such as bedding and seasonal decorations in more than 200 stores in 40 states. For the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, At Home posted a narrower loss of $149.7 million compared with the prior year as sales grew.</td>

      <td>The U.S. needs to give Israel time to degrade the rocket threat.</td>
      <td>As the latest war between Hamas and Israel enters its second week, the narrative is following a familiar script. Hamas fires rockets at Israeli cities, Israel retaliates by bombing the source of the rockets in Gaza, Hamas plays up the civilian casualties, and the world leans on Israel to stop defending itself.<br />Let’s hope this isn’t the trap the Biden Administration falls into as the fighting continues. So far the White House has supported Israel’s right to self-defense. But the weekend bombing of a building in Gaza that housed media offices, including reporters from the Associated Press and Al Jazeera, has led to cries of outrage and an admonition from the State Department to Israel about protecting journalists in combat zones.<br />But who’s really endangering the journalists? Israel’s government says the multistory building was also used by Hamas for intelligence purposes. AP says it had no knowledge of this, but this wasn’t the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Using civilians and journalists as shields is a common Hamas tactic, and Hamas isn’t likely to have shared its plans with Western journalists.<br />Israel also warned the journalists and others in the building to clear out an hour before the attack. They did and there are no reports of casualties. This also let Hamas’s militants escape, but it shows how far Israel has gone in this conflict to avoid killing civilians. Inevitably there will be mistakes in war, and civilians will die, but it’s remarkable how discriminating Israel’s targeting has been.<br />The truth to keep in mind is that this conflict was started by Hamas and another radical outfit, Islamic Jihad. They are attempting to kill Israeli civilians with rockets supplied by Iran, or manufactured in Gaza with parts supplied by Iran. Hamas’s rocket arsenal is larger and more sophisticated than ever, and the Israel Defense Forces said that as of Sunday the Islamists had fired some 3,000 rockets into Israel. The miracle is that more Israelis haven’t died, and that’s due in large part to Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system.</td>

      <td>Progressives are promoting President Biden’s waiver of U.S. Covid vaccine patents as necessary to save lives. So full marks for candor to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who last week explained the real goal: set a precedent that erodes all pharmaceutical intellectual property protections in the U.S. and around the world.<br />“Special [IP] protections for drug companies are an even bigger issue than COVID-19 alone,” the Massachusetts Senator said at a Senate Finance hearing with U.S. Trade Rep Katherine Tai on Wednesday. “I think it’s time now for our trade negotiators to take leadership and actively set rules that lower drug costs for American families.”<br />What special protections? Drug makers receive less IP protection than other businesses under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, which allow low-income countries to force drug makers to license patents during emergencies. But progressives believe IP protections shouldn’t exist at all for drugs and that their makers shouldn’t be rewarded for years of risky investment and innovation.<br />As Ms. Warren explained: “We’re fighting over a waiver to [IP] rules—rules that never should have existed in the first place.”<br />Or as Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden put it: Intellectual property rules should “promote the common good,” which will presumably be defined by . . . Ron Wyden.</td>

      <td>A judge says the federal takeover of state fiscs is likely unconstitutional.</td>
      <td>Pieces of the Biden Administration’s aggressive agenda are starting to make their way before judges, and an early ruling points to trouble for the Democratic takeover of state fiscal policy.<br />The case concerns a provision in the $1.9 trillion spending bill passed in March. It said that states can’t use their share of the funds to “directly or indirectly offset a reduction” in “net tax revenue.” The command, intended to deter legislatures from reducing tax burdens, is so vague it could allow the federal government to second-guess almost any state fiscal policy choice through 2024.<br />Ohio, which is slated to receive $5.5 billion from the bill, sued to invalidate that restriction as an abuse of Congress’s power under the Spending Clause. And in a preliminary opinion last week, federal Judge Douglas Cole found the state has a “substantial likelihood of success on that argument.”<br />One way the Constitution limits federal intrusions on state sovereignty, the opinion explains, is by requiring that Congress set clear conditions for state aid. It quotes a 2006 Supreme Court precedent (Arlington Central School District v. Murphy): “States cannot knowingly accept conditions of which they are ‘unaware’ or which they are ‘unable to ascertain.’”<br />Yet that’s exactly what Congress and the Biden Administration are asking Ohio to do as it decides to either forfeit federal funds or forfeit its ability to cut certain undefined taxes. “The Court honestly has no idea what an ‘indirect offset’ to net tax revenues may be,” wrote Judge Cole, referring to the statute’s restriction on state use of the funds. “It became clear at oral argument that the federal government was largely unwilling to hazard a guess as to what it meant either.”</td>

      <td>Consumers are doubting that prices will remain ‘well-anchored.’</td>
      <td>You’ve heard it a thousand times: Inflation expectations remain “well-anchored.” So goes one of the mantras used by Chairman Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve to explain its monetary adventurism of the last decade or so.<br />For many years this proved to be correct, as the Fed benefited from the lessons of the central bank’s performance in the 1980s in breaking the great inflation of the 1970s. Even then it took years for consumers and businesses to adjust and trust that inflation wouldn’t return. But how about now when the Fed’s monetary accommodation is making even the post-recession policies of the last decade look restrained by comparison?<br />Nearby is a chart of one proxy for inflation expectations to watch in the months ahead: the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers. As the chart shows, expectations for rising prices have jumped this year and now anticipate an increase of more than 4%. This monthly consumer data can be volatile. But another signal is from the Philadelphia Fed’s survey of economic forecasters, which showed five-year average inflation expectations popping in May to 2.4%. That may not seem like much, but that survey rarely moves. The Fed’s inflation target is 2%.<br />The risk is that as inflation expectations rise, they become embedded in consumer behavior and business decisions. Workers demand higher wages to keep up with prices no matter the underlying productivity; businesses pay to keep those workers and then raise prices to compensate. Workers then demand high wages, as expectations are hard to break.<br />Mr. Powell says never fear because all of this is “transitory.” But Americans will judge that for themselves based on what they are paying for goods and services. They may not focus on the nuances of the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, but they know what they are paying for groceries, a new or used car, or to call in the plumber. They’ll decide what’s “well-anchored” or not.</td>

      <td>Many unvaccinated Americans aren’t ‘antivaxxers,’ but need incentive and information.</td>
      <td>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new guidance advising vaccinated Americans that it is safe to shed their masks is a milestone. The prevalence of Covid-19 is declining rapidly; older Americans are largely vaccinated. The task now is to learn to live with Covid. The virus won’t threaten America in the same way again, though neither will it disappear. Forbearance and persuasion will be essential.<br />Soon preventive measures won’t be prescribed by governors or mayors. People and businesses will decide what risks they are comfortable with. Critics of the CDC guidance say it’s too soon to stop masking or worry that there’s no way to tell who is vaccinated and who isn’t. It’s true that some unvaccinated Americans won’t wear masks. But many Americans are following public-health advice in good faith and may now see more incentive to get the shot.<br />The vaccines are remarkably effective. For most Americans, Covid will be a preventable disease. Some will need to continue to take precautions, such as those with compromised immune systems or certain pre-existing conditions like heart or lung disease.<br />Those who are fully vaccinated may want to guard against the remote risk that they could become infected and pass on the virus to someone else. Some will continue to wear masks in certain situations that are perceived to be high-risk—public transit, for instance. Such prudent behavior should be accepted and encouraged.<br />For all the finger pointing at politicians, the past year has included remarkable successes. Americans rose to a difficult challenge, developed highly effective vaccines in record time, and took on burdens to slow the spread until inoculations arrived.</td>

      <td>Biden’s plan to get corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share is popular.</td>
      <td>Sometimes what people don’t say tells you more than what they do. That’s what’s happening with the Republican Party’s reaction to President Biden’s plan to ensure tax fairness. The president has performed political jujitsu by forcing Republicans to minimize their well-worn strategy of attacking Democrats for tax hikes. Far from a merely tactical retreat, the GOP’s decision to play down the issue in public even while maintaining some semblance of the fight behind closed doors highlights a political and substantive crisis.<br />For the past two generations—even before Walter Mondale’s 1984 shellacking—tax cuts have been the most important knot holding the Republican Party together. Wall Street executives never cared much for the social conservatism that drove rural Americans into the GOP. Social conservatives were never that concerned about deficits and wasteful spending outside the welfare state. But Midwest populists and CEOs alike wanted low taxes. For conservatives, it was good politics to harp on the fear that Democrats would reach further into people’s wallets.<br />No more. As Republicans struggle to punch back, they are focused on questions of what is and isn’t “infrastructure” and the laughable notion that they care about deficits. Their old bogeyman isn’t effective anymore. Not only is Mr. Biden’s proposal to make federal tax policy fairer popular with the public; so are the initiatives the new revenue will fund—infrastructure, community college, universal pre-K, public health. Democrats don’t have to run scared on taxes anymore.<br />Public polling tells the story. Nearly 60% of Americans are bothered “a lot” that corporations and rich people don’t pay their fair share, according to a Pew Research survey—and only a third are bothered by the amount they pay themselves. Navigator Research finds 69% support raising taxes on the rich (those making $400,000 or more), on corporations or both to support infrastructure investments—and that includes a majority of Republicans earning less than $50,000 a year. Taken as a whole, 58% of Americans back Mr. Biden’s plan, including 25% of Republicans, according to a Morning Consult poll. This isn’t Ronald Reagan’s coalition anymore—and that works to the Democrats’ advantage.<br />As public attitudes change, Republicans are in a precarious position—and they know it, as revealed by their rhetoric, or lack thereof. The Trumpist base is hip that they don’t get much directly from the sort of tax cuts that Reagan championed, that George W. Bush signed in 2001 and 2003, and that Mr. Trump touted in 2017. A party hoping to refashion itself as a champion of blue-collar voters and the struggling middle class is quickly realizing that the other elements of its economic agenda don’t resonate either. Republicans can rail against waste, as they’re doing. But complaints about deficits are ridiculous when Messrs. Trump and Bush both sent the federal government deep into the red.</td>

      <td>Why did Randi Weingarten pull an about-face? Because not all parents would choose in-person learning.</td>
      <td>When Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers called last week to reopen public schools fully in the fall, she was like an arsonist seeking praise for extinguishing a fire she lit. But it’s increasingly clear the AFT set its own house ablaze. When the unions pressed school districts to offer virtual options last fall, they inadvertently spurred the largest experiment in the history of U.S. education policy. To stop it, they’re condemning the education technique they imposed.<br />Teachers unions have fought for decades against charter schools, scholarship programs, education-related tax credits and other policies that would empower families to seek alternatives to government-run schools. But last fall, thanks to the unions’ obstinance, a large swath of American families suddenly got to choose between in-person and remote instruction. Much to Ms. Weingarten’s chagrin, many of them liked having a choice. “Remote instruction,” she claimed last week, “is not on par with in-person teaching and learning.” But AFT’s own polling this month found 23% felt remote learning “worked just as well” and 6% preferred it.<br />Schooling from home can be an attractive option for students facing obstacles from medical conditions to bullying and long bus rides. Ms. Weingarten’s bucket brigade has been working at the state level to smolder the demand they ignited for virtual schools, particularly in states that didn’t offer them before.<br />Members of the Connecticut Education Association mobilized against a legislative proposal to study virtual schooling and set guidelines for its continued use. One teacher urged lawmakers “to reject normalizing online learning for the sake of students, teachers and society,” while another warned that “continuing virtual learning beyond times of emergency would be detrimental.” The bill died in committee. Connecticut schools won’t have to offer a virtual option after school ends in June.<br />As Corey DeAngelis of the American Federation for Children has noted, teachers unions in Oregon and Pennsylvania worked to prevent students from accessing existing virtual options.</td>

      <td>Political instability is raging again in the Americas, due in part to limited checks on executive power.</td>
      <td>American progressives want to do away with the Electoral College. They say it’s undemocratic because a candidate who gets the most electoral votes can win the presidency without winning the most votes cast by citizens.<br />Yet the genius of the U.S. political system is that it puts the brakes on both majoritarianism and the concentration of power. The Electoral College doesn’t eliminate such risks to domestic peace, but it tempers them.<br />To view presidential systems without the mitigating effects of the Electoral College, see Latin America, where presidents are chosen by popular vote. While the first-past-the-post rule can’t fully explain the failure of democracy to deliver stability and growth in the region, it’s surely part of the puzzle.<br />Latin political instability is raging again. The latest real-time horror show is in Colombia, where violence has surged since the government’s late April announcement of its intention to raise taxes on the middle class. Guerrillas and pro-Venezuela thugs have used the popular backlash against the tax reform to block roads, vandalize property and battle with police. Similar terrorism took place in Chile in 2019. In that case, too, the perpetrators who unleashed the chaos and savagery were trained anticapitalists with the single-minded goal of destruction.<br />Majorities in both countries reject this extremism. Yet the assault on the establishment seems to be working. Democratic capitalism is teetering in both countries as the political class cedes ground to socialists who reject property rights and the rule of law. In Peru a hard-left presidential candidate leads in the polls—though now narrowly—ahead of a June 6 runoff election.</td>

      <td>The men of the Marblehead Regiment rowed Washington across the Delaware and ‘saved the Continental Army multiple times.’</td>
      <td>The military historian Patrick O’Donnell is known for his books on 20th-century elite units, including “First SEALs.” In “The Indispensables,” his second foray into the American Revolution, he does for the soldier-mariners of Marblehead, Mass., what he earlier accomplished for the Continental Army’s First Maryland Regiment in “Washington’s Immortals.” Readers who have enjoyed Mr. O’Donnell’s earlier books will not be disappointed with this one, his 12th.<br />The climax of Mr. O’Donnell’s novel-like account unfolds on Christmas night, 1776, when the “weathered, salty” men of the Marblehead Regiment—many of them veterans of the French and Indian War—rowed George Washington, his 2,400 troops and their artillery across the “fast-flowing, ice chunk-filled” Delaware River. By facilitating the Continental Army’s surprise attack on Hessian and British forces at Trenton, N.J., they turned the tide of the war. Washington is typically the focal point of that momentous scene, as he is in Emanuel Leutze’s painting “Washington Crossing the Delaware.” But Mr. O’Donnell’s gaze remains fixed on the valiant men who delivered him.<br />The author begins their story on the Atlantic Ocean in 1769, off Massachussetts’ Cape Ann, where the Royal Navy has stopped the Pitt Packet. Boarding the Marblehead-based brig under pretense of searching for contraband, a British press-gang is instead intent on kidnapping colonists and compelling them into service for Britain. The American sailors are not fooled. Mayhem ensues. One of the Marbleheaders, Michael Corbett, hurls “his harpoon with the practiced skill of an experience mariner,” impaling and instantly killing Henry Panton, a British lieutenant. Corbett, writes Mr. O’Donnell, was one of the first to offer “deadly defiance against the Crown.” He epitomizes the sea-hardened men of Marblehead.<br />Not all Marbleheaders were as obscure as Corbett. Elbridge Gerry, an “ardent abolitionist” and the “intellectual mainspring behind Marblehead’s revolutionary movement,” signed the Declaration of Independence and later became vice president under James Madison. (Today he is remembered mostly for the term “gerrymandering.”) John Glover, “short, scrappy, and tenacious,” was commander of the Marblehead Regiment and instrumental in forming Washington’s navy. Capt. John Manley—who captured the British brigantine Nancy, one of the war’s greatest prize ships—was celebrated in prose and song. Caleb Gibbs led Washington’s Life Guard, “a small, hand-picked, elite unit.” Nor were those associated with Marblehead all revolutionaries. We also meet the treacherous Dr. Benjamin Church, whose mistress lived in Marblehead, and the loyalist Ashley Bowen, a Marblehead sail-rigger and “prolific diarist” of the Revolution.<br />Some of the events in this history are not well known. The Redcoat seizure of gunpowder from the magazine on Quarry Hill, in present-day Somerville, Mass., in September 1774, for instance, led to the “forgotten first shots of the Revolutionary War,” fired when Marbleheaders stormed Fort William and Mary to get the powder back. Battles at Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill are more famous, as is the siege of Boston and, later, the battles of Brooklyn, Trenton and Princeton. But even when retelling those renowned encounters, Mr. O’Donnell remains focused on the men of Marblehead, whose actions often decided outcomes.</td>

      <td>The social-media site seeks to discredit a review of my book on climate science.</td>
      <td>This paper published Mark Mills’s review of “Unsettled,” my book on climate science, on April 25. Eight days later, 11 self-appointed “fact checkers” weighed in with a 4,500-word critique on the website ClimateFeedback.org.  Facebook  is waving that fact check as a giant red flag whenever the review appears in anyone’s feed.<br />By branding Mr. Mills’s review with “very low scientific credibility,” the company directs its billions of users to a website that claims to discredit the review and, by direct implication, my book. This action adds to the growing suppression of open discussion of climate complexities.<br />ClimateFeedback bills itself as “a worldwide network of scientists sorting fact from fiction in climate change media coverage.” Its modus operandi is to label necessarily brief media statements as misleading or inaccurate, often because they lack context. While acknowledging that “global crop yields are rising,” for instance, they add the untestable claim that yields might have been greater absent human-caused climate change.  The gang of enforcers who “fact checked” Mr. Mills’s review included professors from Stanford, UCLA and MIT.<br />The oddest element of Facebook’s action is that the “fact check” doesn’t challenge anything I wrote in “Unsettled,” but rather provides “context” for Mr. Mills’s statements.<br />The “fact checkers’ ” motivation is apparent in their criticism of a statement about extreme weather events. Two of three fact-checking contributors, Daniel Swain and Andreas Prein, acknowledge that “tornado frequency and severity are also not trending up; nor are the number and severity of droughts,” and go on to explain why it might not be true in the future, as I do in “Unsettled.” Highlighting the absence of global trends in most types of severe weather is a rebuttal of the widespread claim that the climate is “broken.” But another contributor, Kerry Emanuel, an MIT professor who hasn’t read my book, disapproves of the statement because “it sets up a strawman” to disparage climate predictions. It seems Mr. Emanuel would allow media to discuss only deleterious climate trends.</td>

      <td>Regarding “Catholic School Enrollment Plunges” (U.S. News, May 11): The global pandemic clearly took its toll on families and children across the country and in every kind of school. However, Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of New York have been open for in-person instruction five days a week since September, and our dedicated professional educators are even more committed today to ensure every family has the opportunity to access the high-quality education and spiritual enrichment that Catholic schools offer young minds. During this pandemic, our Catholic schools have become the envy of the nation and model to government schools on how to safely and effectively remain open in service to the educational community.<br />Families have specifically shown an appreciation for Catholic schools’ prioritization of safe in-person teaching, which coincides with a significant increase in enrollment numbers ahead of the next school year. More than 2,700 current public-school families have inquired about applying in one of the Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of New York during the current academic year. More than 1,000 new families have already enrolled.<br />As the Journal’s reporting notes, many families who rely on the Catholic-education system are low-income, working-class households. As those families recover from the pandemic’s effects, which have already had a disproportionate impact on many of their communities, Catholic schools offer holistic, reliable and forward-thinking curricula. We’re proud to continue to be a resource for the thousands of New York families who want all children to thrive and achieve their fullest potential.<br />Michael J.

He said BCG executives would be holding more meetings to think through the company’s plans on Sunday and Monday.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated guidance on Thursday threw a new wrinkle into reopening plans, raising questions about whether to speed up office-return dates. Whether companies change course quickly depends, in part, on local laws governing office capacity and masks, as well as the comfort level of employees being asked to return, executives said.<br />Some retailers made a switch on Friday.  Walmart Inc.  said it would no longer require vaccinated workers and shoppers to wear masks in stores and warehouses outside of municipalities that require it, and  Costco Wholesale Corp.  announced a similar policy.</td>

      <td>This week’s data will show how economies around the globe are faring at different stages of recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />In China, investment, industrial output and retail sales are expected to advance at a slower pace in April than March—partly because of the comparison to figures from a year earlier, when the world’s second-largest economy was slowly emerging from its coronavirus lockdown. Retail sales are expected to have risen 24.9% from a year earlier in April, according to a median forecast of 15 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Fixed-asset investment likely rose 19.2% in the first four months of the year, and industrial production, often considered a proxy for growth, is forecast to jump 9.1%.<br />In the first quarter of 2021, Japan’s economy likely contracted 1.2% from the previous quarter, according to economists surveyed by data provider Quick. Economists say private consumption weakened in the three months to March due to the government’s state of emergency in some major prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka.<br />U.S. housing starts rose to a nearly 15-year high in March, underscoring strong demand for homes amid low interest rates, millennials entering their prime homebuying years and a desire for more household space driven by the pandemic. Builders, however, have complained of rising lumber costs and labor-supply constraints, and economists are forecasting a small step back in April construction numbers.<br />U.S. jobless claims fell to a fresh pandemic low during the first full week of May. Another step down during the week ended May 15 would be a sign businesses are hiring new workers and holding on to the ones they have as the labor market steadily improves.</td>

DuBois wrote in 1903, “is the problem of the color line.” The problem of the 20th century turned out to be totalitarian ideologies, which killed scores of millions of people. The killing was baked into the ideology. Mass murder seemed to be a necessity of the century’s Big Ideas.<br />The problem of the 21st century, you might say, is the problem of the narrative line. If you study the manner in which the 20th century’s color line morphed into the 21st century’s narrative line, you may grasp an aspect of the struggle for power today—“for the soul of America,” as the parsons of the left like to say.<br />It isn’t that the complaints of black Americans weren’t or aren’t valid. But common sense tends to be a casualty of political story lines. When DuBois published his statement about the color line, Jim Crow ruled in much of the country. It certainly was the law in Georgia, where blacks didn’t dare try to vote and where white men rode around in sheets and terrorized the countryside. The South in those days was, for blacks, totalitarian indeed.<br />Yet more than 100 years later, in a decisively changed America, President Biden annulled the interval between 1903 and 2021 and pronounced Georgia’s new voting law to be “Jim Crow on steroids.” It was demagogic nonsense. The Georgia voting law bore no more resemblance to Jim Crow than Mr. Biden bears, let us say, to Neil Kinnock.<br />But in the 21st century, the country has been all but lost to the politics of whoppers. It’s always Saturday morning in America now, and the TV is always playing cartoons. Donald Trump has a genius for the form. Since November, his big story line has been that the 2020 election was stolen from him.</td>

Now, in quick succession, natural gas finds itself threatened with the same kind of disruption, only this time from cost-effective batteries charged with wind and solar energy.<br />Natural-gas-fired electricity represented 38% of U.S. generation in 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, and it supplies round-the-clock electricity as well as bursts during peak demand. Wind and solar generators have gained substantial market share, and as battery costs fall, batteries paired with that green power are beginning to step into those roles by storing inexpensive green energy and discharging it after the sun falls or the wind dies.</td>

After first being spotted off Morocco, it passed Gibraltar and made its way as far as Italy before doubling back along the French and Spanish coasts toward the Atlantic, cut off from its usual food sources and growing thinner with each sighting. Researchers worry whether the whale will survive.<br />Aerial photographs showed Wally passing over reefs, almost within touching distance of people’s coastside gardens and resort beaches as it looked for a way out. One showed it near the sea wall at a popular beach in Barcelona.<br />The mystery, though, is how the whale got to the Mediterranean in the first place.<br />Gray whales were thought to have been extinct in the Atlantic since the early 18th century because of overhunting; they were long prized for their rich oil. Today, the only known population is in the Pacific, where they migrate 6,000 miles between the waters off Mexico, where they mate and reproduce, and the rich feeding grounds in the Bering and Chukchi seas, where they dive to the ocean floor to fatten up on crustaceans and shrimp.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve and Biden administration officials say economic inequality is bad and they aim their policies in part at helping to reduce it. In the short run, at least, those policies might be widening inequality, not shrinking it.<br />In recent months, inflationary pressures have caused the cost of living to rise faster than paychecks, meaning a paycheck hasn’t been going as far as it did before. Consumer price inflation in April rose 4.2% from a year earlier, while hourly pay for production workers rose 1.2%, the Labor Department reported last week.<br />The department also said that, after adjusting for inflation, wages of production workers and nonmanagers fell 3.3% in April from a year earlier, the largest such decline since an inflation shock and recession in 1980.<br />Economists, policy makers and many in the voting public have differing views about income inequality, and the increasing concentration of wealth in the top 1%. Some see inequality as a sign of an unfair economic system that the government should address; others say a healthy capitalist economy rewards its most productive citizens.<br />A fall in inflation-adjusted wages hits low- and moderate-income households especially hard, because they dedicate a larger share of their paychecks to covering daily living costs. The numbers might be temporarily skewed, but if inflation persists and is fueled by the Fed or the Biden administration’s policies, it could raise questions about the costs and benefits of those policies for working Americans.</td>

      <td>Republicans and experts say the free-college part of the American Families Plan fails to address deep-seated problems</td>
      <td>President Biden’s plan to offer Americans the opportunity to attend community college for free is running up against political obstacles over who should pay for it and skepticism on whether it would broaden access to higher education.<br />His proposal—unveiled in April as part of his $1.8 trillion American Families Plan—would waive tuition for two years of public community college. It would also provide many students more cash to cover living expenses that often deter students from lower-income families from attending.<br />As with other aspects of the overall Biden plan, the $256 billion community-college proposal represents a gamble on big social spending. It could reduce inequality and boost wages of lower-income households, as the White House envisions, or it might shovel more taxpayer money into a system that some academics across the political spectrum say chronically underperforms.<br />The White House says spending more on community college will lead to more Americans enrolling, gaining skills and landing well-paying jobs—in turn boosting incomes and the U.S.’s economic competitiveness. By shifting education costs to taxpayers, supporters say, the plan would ease reliance on student debt, which has soared in recent years.<br />Republicans and some academics on both the left and right say that community college is already inexpensive and making it free wouldn’t sufficiently address deep-seated problems with the system: high dropout rates and entering students being unprepared for college-level work.</td>

Markets think the answer is that the Fed will accept far more than consumers would like, and the market is probably right: Inflation could easily be at 5% early next year without prompting any change of strategy. So long as the Fed expects inflation to come back down and investors and workers have faith, it is under no pressure to move. The danger is that high inflation shakes that faith.<br />Investors were shocked by the jump in inflation reported last week. The core inflation that economists tend to focus on, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.9% month-on-month in April, an annualized rate above 11%. (Year-over-year, core inflation was 3%.)<br />Bond yields duly jumped, but the 10-year Treasury yield is still below where it stood in March. There is no sign that investors expect the Fed to be anything but super-dovish.<br />“The bar’s going to be really high for the Fed to deviate from the path they’ve laid out,” said Andrew Balls, chief investment officer of global fixed income at Pimco.<br />To see why, consider one fairly rosy scenario for inflation. Over the next six months we have a smooth reduction in monthly core inflation, as supply constraints—shipping, lumber, microchips, cars, worker shortages, everything—ease and consumers have less leftover stimulus to spend. By November, assume prices are rising at a modest 0.17% a month, where they need to be to reach 2% a year. In this scenario the year-over-year rate, the one we usually look at, would peak at 5.2% next February, and still be above 3% next July.</td>

      <td>When Google Photos free storage ends June 1, should you upgrade to a paid plan? Here are your cloud photo-backup options</td>
      <td>Google  Photos had me from the start with a killer feature: free, unlimited photo and video backup. The caveat? It compressed image files larger than 16 megapixels.<br />I knew, when the service launched in 2015, that the perk couldn’t last forever. Millions of people dumping all their snapshots into the cloud? It wasn’t sustainable, even for Google.<br />Next month, Google Photos is ending its free tier. After June 1, any newly uploaded media will count toward the 15 gigabytes included with any Google account—unless you currently own a Pixel phone. That means your photos compete with your Gmail and anything in your Google Drive. If you have had the account a while, you might already be close to full. Many people will need to upgrade to a paid plan or back up their photos elsewhere.<br />The change gives us freeloaders the opportunity to rethink the future of our digital memories. Here’s one option for archiving your photos offline, plus a look at different online backup options.<br />While online services are the easiest way to back up and access your photos, we first need to discuss a way to store photos yourself. If you don’t choose to use an online option, you would still have this, and even if you do, it’s nice to have an offline backup. Your memories are too precious!</td>

      <td>Behind decorator Beth Diana Smith’s colorful signature style is a career path in accounting and corporate finance that’s all business</td>
      <td>For interior designer Beth Diana Smith, the path to home décor began with numbers. Math came easily to her and by age 10, she said, “I knew I wanted to become an accountant.”<br />She received a bachelor’s in business administration and a master’s in professional accounting from Seton Hall University. “I like understanding the rules, processes and definitive answers,” said Ms. Smith, 41, who grew up in Montclair, N.J. “No one in my family is creative.”<br />At age 23, she bought a two-bedroom townhouse, in part because becoming a young homeowner seemed financially astute. Another incentive: Her mother, who had recently become ill with dementia and heart issues, could come live with her. Ms. Smith gravitated to corporate finance in her mid-twenties, while working at  Johnson & Johnson .  “It’s more strategic than accounting,” she said. “I had to figure things out, and I liked figuring things out.”<br />In 2008, she joined MTV International’s finance team, based at parent company Viacom’s New York headquarters. “It was a step up from what I was doing, and it sounded interesting,” Ms. Smith said. She became director of finance for international digital media in 2010 and less than a year later became director of finance for MTV’s international programming. Ms. Smith hesitated before accepting the position because her mother had just died. But she threw herself into the job and soon was working with MTV International’s CFO and president as well as traveling the world. “I was staying in hotels enough that I started to miss my home,” she said.<br />In her scant spare time, Ms. Smith redecorated, indulging a passion for interior design that was kindled by home-ownership. “With my mother gone, I felt like I had to change the feeling of the house,” she said. “This is a common thing, I’ve learned. Whenever someone loses someone in the home, they’re inspired to redo things.” Poring over design blogs and magazines, she realized she could do something useful with her knack for organizing small spaces. In early 2009, she hung out her shingle as a professional organizer. Over time, clients began to ask for help beyond their closets and pantries, and by year’s end the business evolved into an interior design firm, which Ms. Smith ran alongside her corporate career.</td>

      <td>Antitrust lawsuit targets how much the iPhone maker collects in fees from developers, as mobile app marketplaces have grown into multibillion-dollar businesses</td>
      <td>If there is one thing Epic Games Inc. and  Apple Inc.  can both agree on even as they battle each other, it is that the app economy is worth fighting over.<br />In the 13 years since Apple launched its App Store, the number of apps has exploded. The business of delivering them to people’s smartphones has grown into a revenue stream worth tens of billions of dollars annually for Apple and the other main marketplace operator,  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google.<br />App stores have become critical gatekeepers in accessing software that lets users do everything on the internet, including watch television, read books and check the weather. Key to the stores’ business models is that they collect a commission on consumers’ purchases of digital goods and services. They don’t take a portion of sales of real-world goods and services, like T-shirts or car rides purchased through an app from their stores, but when someone spends on a videogame perk or subscribes to an online fitness program, the gatekeepers get their cuts.<br />The fees that Apple and Google charge—30% in many cases—are at the center of lawsuits filed by “Fortnite” creator Epic Games against the tech giants. Epic claims that Apple’s App Store rules stifle competition and run afoul of antitrust law. Apple disputes Epic’s allegations, saying that its rules are applied evenly and that charging a commission is legal and covers expenses such as maintaining user privacy.<br />The trial in Epic’s case against Apple started May 3 and has the potential to upend a key part of the iPhone maker’s services business.</td>

      <td>The electric-car revolution is reaching the streets of Africa.<br />A handful of startups in several countries are building small electric-vehicle fleets of light carriers and motorcycles—vehicles well suited for the continent’s challenging roads—for taxi and delivery services.<br />In February, Kenya-based ARC Ride launched electric two- and three-wheelers for Uber Eats deliveries in Nairobi, a city of 4.4 million. While the company currently has 35 vehicles operating, Chief Executive Joseph Hurst-Croft, a former environmental activist in Nigeria, says he expects the fleet to grow to 300 by August. ARC also is building its own charging network across the city fed by thermal energy generated from volcanic heat along East Africa’s tectonic rift.<br />Proponents of electric vehicles and renewable energy see motorcycles as the fastest way to promote inexpensive, clean-energy transportation in Africa, where roads are often traffic-clogged and potholed. The executives at ARC hope that their efforts in Nairobi will be a launchpad for a broader expansion throughout Africa—akin to the way the cellular telecommunications revolution bypassed wired lines in many areas. ARC’s chairman is Johannesburg-based retired investment banker Richard Douma.<br />Rob de Jong, head of sustainability for the United Nations Environment Program, or UNEP, says that “two- and three-wheelers are the low-hanging fruit” of EV mobility in Africa. UNEP is funding EV projects in seven African countries. “The potential leapfrog is massive,” says Mr. de Jong, who is based in Nairobi.</td>

      <td>Proponents say they should be part of a low-carbon future. But cost and efficiency remain hurdles.</td>
      <td>Maybe the combustion engine isn’t dead after all. Synthetic fuels are attracting growing interest as a way to make industries ranging from jets to ships to cars greener without having to rethink or replace their traditional engines.<br />Known as electrofuels or e-fuels, these synthetics are made by mixing hydrogen derived from renewable sources usually with captured carbon dioxide to create a virtually carbon-neutral version of fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene.<br />Some airlines, cargo shippers and oil companies already have pilot projects under way to produce e-fuels, or are experimenting with blends of e-fuels and conventional fuels. Auto makers also are investing in the technology, with some saying e-fuels could be a way to keep older passenger cars on the road, alongside electric and hybrid vehicles, as a cleaner form of transportation.<br />The technology underlying e-fuels isn’t new. Nearly a century ago, German scientists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch invented a method, known as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, that mixes carbon monoxide with hydrogen to create synthetic petroleum.<br />Synthetic fuels have many advantages, according to supporters: They can be blended with conventional fuels—density and quality are similar—or replace them completely without altering existing pipelines, refilling stations and engines. They also can be easily transported and stored for extended periods.</td>

      <td>If we never forage beyond what’s sweet and accessible, we miss out on worlds of zesty excitement, from elderberries to mangosteen</td>
      <td>The other day, I bought a large bunch of delicious seeded black Muscat grapes. They reminded me of the grapes of my childhood, when grapes with seeds were normal and seedless grapes were still a luxury. But when I gave some to my 12-year-old son, I was startled to find that he actually gave up eating them halfway through, commenting that it was just too boring avoiding the seeds.<br />This got me thinking about how different fruit is now from what it was in the past, even the recent past. We have become accustomed to the idea that fruit is something sweet, likable and eternally available, almost like candy. With supermarket fruit, there are no bony seeds or prickles to navigate, and much of the time our fruit even comes pre-peeled and pre-chopped.<br />But fruit doesn’t have to be easy. There’s a special kind of joy to eating fruit that makes you work slightly harder for the payoff. I have a damson tree in my garden, and one of the pleasures of late summer for me is picking the dusty-blue fruits, which are like plums only much, much tarter and smaller. Stewed with a little sugar and sieved, these damsons yield a dark magenta purée that makes every supermarket plum taste bland by comparison. I keep damson purée in the freezer and have it over yogurt or oatmeal in the morning, and every time I taste it, I marvel at its acerbic power.<br />If we only ever eat fruit that is sweet, soft and accessible, we miss out on whole worlds of fruit excitement. It’s a bit like only listening to music in a major key. “The Book of Difficult Fruit: Arguments for the Tart, Tender and Unruly” by Kate Lebo (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) is a fascinating new book that celebrates the edgier side of fruit. Ms. Lebo wants us to consider fruits that are mouth-puckeringly sour (rhubarb or gooseberries or yuzu), fruits that are mildly poisonous (like the pits of cherries and apricots), fruits that are as stinky as cheese (durian) and fruits so inky-dark they will stain your clothes (elderberries).<br />The whole nature of fruit has changed in modern times. Fruit used to be something that was deeply seasonal and mostly wild, whereas now it is mostly domesticated and available year-round. But there are still wild fruits around if you know where to look. Ms. Lebo writes about the many varieties of native huckleberry in the U.S., a fruit so stubborn that they “refuse to be domesticated.” The word is sometimes used just to mean wild blueberry, but huckleberries are really several families of small woodland berries, some of which grow in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest (Vaccinium membranaceum) and some of which grow more on the East Coast (Gaylussacia baccata, for example). No one has found a way to grow “hucks” commercially. As Asta Bowen wrote in “The Huckleberry Book,” the huckleberry is “wildness in your hand.”</td>

      <td>Nothing says “re-entry” quite like a brand new bag, an accessory that’s kept a low profile for a year. As you cautiously prepare for post-pandemic life, consider bolstering your wardrobe with these women’s, men’s and children’s options.</td>
      <td>IT’S ALWAYS a good time to buy a bag,” said Sarah Newkirk, a mortgage underwriter in Waterford, Wis. Last year, some prominent fashion observers disagreed, wondering if we’d ever embrace handbags again, with Australia’s Daily Telegraph, for one, suggesting the pandemic might bury the accessory for good. Unaware of these death knells, Ms. Newkirk did a lot of embracing just last month, treating herself to a pink nylon Kate Spade bag for her 40th birthday as well as a black-and-rust Coach crossbody. “I’ve been buying bags [throughout the pandemic] to cheer myself up. And, like everybody else, I gained weight,” she said. “But a handbag always looks good.”<br />Ms. Newkirk is not in the minority. “In the beginning, the world seemed to stop altogether,” said Hallie Spradlin, director of accessories at Fashion Snoops, a trend-forecasting agency. But by last summer, cooped-up men and women “were looking for a mood boost…and started investing in bags.” Yumi Shin, chief merchant of New York department store Bergdorf Goodman, called handbags “pandemic proof”—particularly, she added, when they’re in perky hues like tangerine or neon green. Perhaps that’s because they represent optimism: Buying a bag designed to tote essentials between home, school, the office and even the airport suggests that we’ll soon return to some version of our bustling former lives. Paul-Sebastian Japaz, a New York painter, said he began building “an arsenal” of bags last summer. His buys range from Telfar’s vegan Shopping Bag to an as-yet-unused leather Prada tote. Mr. Japaz, 29, cheerily called it the “back-to-school bag.”<br />However, as our lifestyles have shifted, so too have our handbag tastes. The awkwardly bulky, top-handle work bags so prevalent pre-pandemic have been ousted by smaller, more versatile options that facilitate a lighter existence. Giana Ballard, 29, who owns a New York photography studio, recently splurged on a canvas Balenciaga bag with a long shoulder strap. Before the pandemic, she used different bags for day and night, work and play. Now she wears her roughly 8-inch-tall bucket bag (which fits her iPhone, camera, lipstick and a crucial can of pamplemousse LaCroix) for morning walks, afternoon errands and outdoor dinners. Once she needs to carry heftier cargo like, say, a laptop, again, Ms. Ballard plans to team her modest new pal with a roomier tote.<br />Curt Myers, a Boston public-affairs consultant and erstwhile traveler, has bought three bags during the pandemic—a leather duffel and two backpacks. Mr. Myers, 28, admitted that he “never really looked at bags” before, but with a surfeit of time and a new, social distancing-inspired love of hiking, he sought pieces that fused style and utility. His usual habit of searching for cities to visit was irrational, he said. “The alternative was to buy [these bags] that symbolized travel.”<br />Katrina Tracy waited until she was vaxxed to splash out on a faux-snakeskin Steve Madden crossbody-cum-fanny pack. “It was a little bit of an affirmation of, ‘We’re getting back to it!’” said Ms. Tracy, 34, who works in human resources in Los Angeles. She debuted the chain-embellished bag when visiting her grandmother, whom she’d seen only once in the past year. “It was fun to have a conversation with her about my shiny new purse,” she said. Her grandmother thought it was adorable.</td>

That’s one reason several chains premiered the Netflix zombie-heist movie “Army of the Dead” Friday, one week before it becomes available on the service.<br />The unlikely alliance between movie houses and the streaming giant is another sign of the ways Covid-19 has upended the decades-old dynamic between Hollywood entertainers and the theaters that show their movies. Pandemic-related production shutdowns and a strategic shift away from the big screen have resulted in a programming crunch likely to last years, leaving theaters with no choice but to make deals with Netflix and other streaming services that allow them to play movies at home soon after their big-screen premieres.<br />Theaters are now compromising on terms they once considered sacrosanct, especially the length of time studios must wait before making movies available to watch at home.<br />“Pre-Covid there were these rules,” said one theater executive. “Post-Covid there’s a whole new ballgame.

He denies wrongdoing.<br />But the past six days of national turmoil have offered the Israeli prime minister a political lifeline. When Arab parties and a right-wing politician pulled out of talks this week to join or back a rival coalition, the threat to unseat Mr. Netanyahu appeared to collapse.<br />“Netanyahu has always thrived in environments of uncertainty, of chaos and crisis,” said Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and director of Keevoon Global Research, who worked as an aide to Mr. Netanyahu in the 1990s. “He basically goes from crisis to crisis.”<br />Even before the recent conflict and internal tensions, Mr. Netanyahu has had to navigate the country through a difficult year. Israel had one of the worst coronavirus rates per capita before a successful vaccination campaign; its economy was battered by pandemic-related shutdowns; and it has faced off against Iran, hitting its allies in Syria and its ships at sea.</td>

The paper’s website, too, has been restricted by Venezuela’s telecommunications regulator on numerous occasions since then.<br />But the paper’s seizure could have greater implications for the Maduro regime’s attempts to turn a new page with the Biden administration. Under former President Donald Trump, the U.S. levied a rash of sanctions against the government and top Maduro confidants for alleged human-rights violations, election fraud and corruption. The punitive actions failed to unseat Mr. Maduro but have cut the country off from its traditional oil partners and pummeled an economy that was once Latin America’s richest.<br />Human-rights and press-advocacy groups called the ruling the latest action meant to quash critical media in a country where dissidents have faced jail and intimidation and have been forced to flee. Diosdado Cabello, a top honcho in Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party who had filed the civil defamation suit against the media outlet, has said that he wants to convert the publication’s headquarters into a pro-regime communications school.</td>

      <td>After more than a year of being glued to their devices, a lot of kids will have trouble easing up on the tech that brought them comfort and connection during the pandemic.<br />In a recent survey of 325 parents conducted by market-research firm Ipsos, 22% reported that their children spend an average of 10 or more hours a week on entertainment-related screen time—far more time than many of the surveyed parents said they would like. It’s also hard for many adults to put down their devices, which is why I’m offering tips from experts on how families can do a digital reset together.<br />Here are the best suggestions:<br />Create spaces for conversation. “The biggest tech problem many families have is losing conversation and family time to phones,” said Sherry Turkle, founding director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self. That’s why she advises designating certain spaces just for conversation. These can include the kitchen and the dinner table.<br />She also suggests that kids not bring devices with them in the car. I agree with this one—to an extent. Some of the best conversations I’ve had with all three of my kids together have occurred when we were driving to the store or to activities. However, I’m in favor of taking tablets on long road trips. Even though I always pack activity books for the kids, some screen time cuts down on the “Are we there yet?” whining.

      <td>Six charts show how a hasty reopening, new variants and a struggling vaccine rollout allowed the  coronavirus to stage a comeback</td>
      <td>India is in the middle of a devastating Covid-19 surge that has set records for new infections and deaths and severely strained its healthcare system. Last week, India became the second country after the U.S. to surpass 20 million cases.<br />The current situation is a far cry from just five months ago, when the country had seemingly tamed a first surge of the pandemic. What’s different this time around? A look at the factors behind India’s deadly second surge:<br />India’s first surge peaked in September, when newly reported cases were approaching 100,000 a day. By the start of this year, that number had dropped by 80%. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Brazil, the two other countries hardest hit by Covid-19, were facing rapidly rising caseloads.<br />With the outbreak ebbing this winter, Indians eased up on mask-wearing and social distancing. Life was returning to normal, with visits to malls, movies and restaurants approaching pre-pandemic levels. Political rallies and religious festivals, where masses of people crowded together, potentially served as “super-spreader” events.<br />Just as India was opening up, new coronavirus variants were gaining hold in the population. These include the one first detected in the U.K., as well as B.1.617, which was first identified in the state of Maharashtra and has since gone on to become the dominant variant on the subcontinent.</td>

      <td>More of the energy we use will come from the electric socket. And we aren’t ready.</td>
      <td>If you’ve lost power anytime recently, you’ve come face to face with one of the fundamental truths about energy today: There are a lot of things we once could do without electricity that now require it.<br />You’ve also come face to face with one of the hottest, and most poorly understood, buzz phrases in energy—the “electrification of everything.”<br />The concept, most simply put, is that more of the energy we use will come from the electric socket. Instead of having fuels like natural gas or oil or gasoline flow directly into our homes, offices, manufacturing facilities and cars, those fuels—and other sources of energy—will increasingly be converted to electricity first.<br />The idea is being pushed by several groups with a vested interest in seeing it happen—most notably, environmentalists and the tech industry. But in some sense, consumers have already made the choice to move toward at least the “electrification of a lot more things,” if not everything. That’s because our smartphones and computers and all the other devices that attach to them require electric power. So electrification is happening, whether we’ve made a conscious decision to electrify or not.<br />And that trend will only accelerate. The Biden administration’s infrastructure bill, for instance, has set aside $174 billion for electric vehicles and related public charging stations. An additional $100 billion is allocated to bringing broadband to those who currently lack it. In California, electric heat pumps are gaining traction as more than 26 of the state’s counties and cities have enacted bans on natural-gas hookups in new construction. Other places have done the same, and there’s no doubt many others across the country will follow.</td>

She typically tips $3.<br />“Sometimes, I walk away and I’m like, I probably could have gotten an appetizer at a restaurant for that price,” says Ms. Seroka, a 29-year-old who works as an advertising account manager.<br />Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, she says she has found herself tipping service workers 30% or more to champion businesses that have struggled to stay afloat.<br />“I feel good about it for supporting them but sometimes, by the time the tip is done and your different specifications with your coffee, you’re like, ‘Oh my God, I need to get my spending under control.’ ”<br />Tipping on credit cards increased nationwide last summer, according to Mike Lynn, researcher and professor at Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration. Analyzing data from payment company Square, Prof. Lynn found that credit-card tips for quick-service and full-service restaurant delivery orders jumped from below 11% before the pandemic to above 15% in May of last year.</td>

His departure followed complaints by some workers at Apple about sexist and misogynistic passages in a memoir Mr. García Martínez wrote about his time at  Facebook .<br />“At Apple, we have always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted. Behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here,” the iPhone maker said.<br />Mr. García Martínez, however, disputed Apple’s version of events. “I did not ‘part ways’ with Apple. I was fired by Apple in a snap decision,” he wrote on his verified  Twitter  account Friday. “Apple has issued a statement that clearly implies there was some negative behavior by me during my time at Apple. That is defamatory and categorically false.”<br />In one passage of his book, “Chaos Monkeys,” which was marketed as nonfiction, Mr. García Martínez wrote: “Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit.”</td>

The target landing site had been the southern part of Mars’s Utopia Planitia, a large plain. It descended from the Tianwen-1 orbiter that has been circling Mars since February.<br />The landing—and automated process lasting minutes—was the most challenging aspect of China’s most ambitious space mission to date. The probe had to rely on parachutes, retrorockets and its blunt shape to decelerate and touch down on the planet, the China National Space Administration has said.<br />The country’s space program has been a source of pride in China as President Xi Jinping continues to preside over an era of nationalism. China has largely had to go-it-alone in space exploration after being shut out of NASA-related initiatives since 2011 by U.S. law.<br />“This is a crowning moment for China,” said Namrata Goswami, a co-author of the book “Scramble for the Skies: The Great Power Competition to Control the Resources of Outer Space.” “It sends a signal to the world that it has caught up with the U.S. in capacity for interplanetary exploration, and that it can be an alternative to the U.S. for space leadership.”</td>

The lawsuit continued once Mr. Biden took office, but would likely be rendered moot by the revocation of the order.</td>

      <td>The policy that is raising pump prices about 30 cents a gallon.</td>
      <td>Gasoline prices hit a six-year high this week amid the Colonial Pipeline shutdown and a rebound in demand as more people hit the road. But one overlooked cause of higher prices at the pump is Congress’s ethanol mandate.<br />Economists aren’t the best at predicting how markets or technologies will evolve, but politicians are worse. In the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, Congress required gasoline sold in the U.S. to contain increasing volumes of “renewable” fuel—i.e., ethanol from corn, algae and cellulosic waste.<br />The bill, in its unwisdom, tasked the Environmental Protection Agency with assigning refiners and importers annual quotas for ethanol they must blend into gasoline or diesel fuel. The businesses get tradeable credits known as renewable identification numbers (RINs) for each gallon of renewable fuel. Those that don’t meet their quotas have to buy RINs from other parties to comply.<br />Congress’s ethanol requirements were never realistic, though its real goal was to boost corn farmers in the Midwest and the nascent “advanced” biofuels, which are still nascent. The blending mandates have become increasingly unattainable as fuel economy has improved, which is harming smaller refiners and pushing up gas prices.<br />Refiners are crashing into what’s known as the “blend wall”—i.e., the volume of ethanol that can be sold given existing cars and infrastructure. Warranties don’t allow older cars to run on ethanol blends higher than 10% because it can corrode engines. Ditto storage tanks and pumps at the gas station. The EPA has repeatedly reduced the targets—last year by 33% overall—though small refineries have still struggled to meet their quotas. Some spend more on compliance and RINs credits than on payroll, electricity and utilities.</td>

      <td>California shows that Democratic claims of fiscal hardship were a political trick.</td>
      <td>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday again spun the fiction that states and localities are drowning in red ink. Apparently she missed California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s news that the state has an astonishing $75 billion budget surplus.<br />“During the Great Recession, when cities and states were facing similar revenue shortfalls, the federal government didn’t provide enough aid to close the gap. That was an error,” Ms. Yellen said as she rolled out expansive guidance on how states can use their $350 billion booty from the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion spending bill.<br />“Insufficient relief meant that cities had to slash spending, and that austerity undermined the broader recovery,” she added. “With today’s announcement, we are charting a very different—and much faster—course back to prosperity.”<br />Talk about fighting the last war. Most states and localities were already prospering financially before Democrats handed them $350 billion in direct aid plus $129 billion for schools and tens of billions more for Medicaid, colleges and public transit, among other things, in March. The Census Bureau recently reported that 2020 state and local revenues overall were 3.7% higher than in 2019.<br />Tax revenues have been surging in the first several months of this year, especially in Democratic-leaning states that tax their rich more. New Jersey’s general fund revenues for the fiscal year are running 15% higher than a year ago, letting Gov. Phil Murphy for the first time make his state’s full actuarially required pension payment.</td>

      <td>Montana moves to let doctors dispense prescribed meds directly to patients.</td>
      <td>One down, five to go. This week Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a reform bill letting doctors dispense prescribed medicine directly to their patients. This leaves only five states—Massachusetts, Texas, New Hampshire, New York and New Jersey—that force citizens to go to a pharmacy instead of getting their medicine straight from the doctor.<br />This victory for competition and common sense is the result of a lawsuit filed last June by the Institute for Justice (IJ), on behalf of three Treasure State doctors seeking the freedom to dispense “non-controlled medications directly to their patients at cost.” Montana, like other states with similar bans, has allowed exceptions for doctors when the nearest pharmacy is 10 miles or more away. And studies, such as a 2014 National Evaluation of Prescriber Drug Dispensing, have made clear that getting meds from a doctor is as safe as getting them from a pharmacy.<br />The Montana Pharmacy Association deserves credit for ultimately endorsing this legislation. Support for the new law grew after an association spokesman testified before a state Senate committee that “at the root of our previous opposition to similar bills was protectionism.” The same spokesman said another deciding factor was the IJ lawsuit pending in state court.<br />Now that the law has passed, IJ is withdrawing its suit. But it has a similar suit in Texas, and both Texas and Massachusetts are considering legislation like Montana’s that would normalize a practice that is legal in most every other state. As the Montana Pharmacy Association made clear, the sole point of the restriction was to use government power to limit competition—which hurt patients far more than doctors.</td>

      <td>It is an incredible pleasure to shut out the media for 25 hours, and I actually dread the end of day when then electronics come back to life.</td>
      <td>As a lifelong Sabbath-observant Orthodox Jew, I’ve found that the Covid-19 pandemic has only strengthened my emotional relationship with Shabbos, which is the Ashkenazi pronunciation of Sabbath (“What We’ve Lost in Rejecting the Sabbath,” Review, May 8). I have to admit that when I was a child Shabbos was something to be endured, 25 hours of no TV, plowing through my library books and hoping the pages would outlast the hours of the day. As an adult, however, it became the oasis in a hectic workweek, a chance to reconnect with the family over food and conversation. Covid has elevated the experience to a whole new level. In the early weeks and months of the pandemic I found myself glued to the news, unable to look away, wondering if my practice would ever reopen, what would happen if someone got sick? I can’t begin to explain what it felt like, what it still feels like, to systematically shut off my two iPads, my iPhone, my smartwatch and the laptop in the seconds before sunset. It is an incredible pleasure to shut out the media for 25 hours, and I actually dread the end of day when the electronics come back to life. Having been raised this way certainly makes it easier to be religious, so to speak, about not “cheating” and turning something on, but the mental and physical payoff for having a true day of rest is incalculable.<br />Chani Miller<br />Highland Park, N.J.</td>

The increase of millions resulted almost entirely because of immigrants and their descendants.<br />You further state that: “Existing entitlements will be harder to fund if the population grows more slowly.” Medicaid is one of those entitlements. According to the CDC, Medicaid funded 59% of Hispanic women’s deliveries in 2018 and 46% of those women were foreign born, mostly from Mexico and Central America.<br />The largest entitlement is a free public education. U.S. schools aren’t suffering from a student shortage. America isn’t suffering from a worker shortage. America isn’t suffering from a people shortage.

      <td>Nero is remembered as a villain, but a new exhibition suggests there was more to the Roman ruler than meets the eye.</td>
      <td>After the Roman emperor Nero committed suicide in 68 AD, at the age of 30, a hostile Senate made a concerted effort to suppress any record of his existence. This act of damnatio memoriae, “condemnation of memory,” consisted of defacing or destroying images bearing Nero’s likeness, and it has made things difficult for the curators of “Nero: The Man Behind the Myth,” a new exhibition opening May 27 at the British Museum.<br />The marble portraits on display in the show aren’t always what they seem. For instance, a bust of Vespasian, who became emperor in 69 AD after a brief civil war, is actually a recarved bust of Nero, says lead curator Thorsten Opper. Small traces on the surface of the marble at the back of the neck indicate “where a longer section of hair, characteristic of Nero’s coiffure, was removed.”<br />Another marble bust in the exhibition, from Rome’s Musei Capitolini, is one of the best known portraits of Nero, the model for how the emperor was portrayed in the Hollywood epic “Quo Vadis” (1951). But “only the central part of the face is ancient,” Mr. Opper says. “Everything else is a brilliant 17th century restoration, and he looks big, and he looks mean and gluttonous and tyrannical. But it’s based on distorted sources.”<br />The premise of the exhibition is that Nero’s reign, from 54 to 68 AD, was a lot more accomplished and less tyrannical than we think. The stories about his depravity—for instance, that he had his mother Agrippina murdered—come from historians like Tacitus and Suetonius, members of a senatorial elite that was jealous of imperial power. Both wrote roughly 50 years after Nero’s death, “when there was a new dynasty in power, which made it extremely important to paint the previous dynasty that ended with Nero in the worst possible light,” says exhibition curator Francesca Bologna.<br />The exhibition includes over 200 artifacts contemporary with Nero’s reign, including statues, wall paintings, graffiti, armor, writing tablets, coins and jewelry. Several of these objects come from a mass of new finds made over the last 15 years, including three of the so-called “Bloomberg tablets,” a collection of 405 preserved wooden writing tablets that were found at the site of the new Bloomberg building in London in 2010-13.</td>

The position doesn’t require Senate confirmation.<br />The officials said Ms. Tanden will be responsible for preparing for various contingencies that could arise from the Supreme Court’s consideration of Republican lawsuits aimed at undoing the Affordable Care Act. The Biden administration has argued that the Obamacare law is constitutional and a decision on the case, which was argued in November, is pending before the court.<br />Ms. Tanden also will review the United States Digital Service, which seeks to make the federal government more accessible to people online, the officials said.<br />Ms. Tanden’s nomination was withdrawn in March after Senate Republicans and a key Senate Democrat opposed her nomination over past social-media comments, which included criticism of senators. The White House said after the withdrawal that it planned to find a position for her that didn’t require Senate approval.</td>

      <td>Many businesses aren’t budging on face masks for now; others say they are reviewing new CDC guidance</td>
      <td>American companies began to rethink their requirements for face masks after federal health regulators relaxed their guidelines this week, and on Friday Walmart Inc. made the first big move to bend to the new view.<br />The U.S.’s largest private employer said it would no longer require vaccinated workers and shoppers to wear masks in stores and warehouses outside of municipalities that require it. Walmart’s new no-mask policy for its 1.6 million U.S. workers goes into effect May 18, the company said, while vaccinated customers could shop maskless immediately.<br />That made the country’s largest retailer by revenue an early mover in response to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new guidance. Executives in sectors ranging from autos to grocers said they were still wrestling with how to respond to the new guidelines, which they note conflicts in many cases with state, local and other protocols specific to certain industries.<br />Car makers  General Motors Co.  and  Toyota Motor Corp.  said they are sticking with existing policies while awaiting guidance from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has jurisdiction over their workplaces and still requires face coverings and social distancing. The agency didn’t immediately update its guidance based on the CDC announcement. OSHA representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.<br />Some national retailers said they were reviewing the CDC’s changes.  Kroger Co. , the nation’s biggest supermarket chain, said it would continue requiring masks and encouraging social distancing.

      <td>A strange apology from DarkSide indicates where crime-for-profit ends and national security begins.</td>
      <td>Newt Gingrich would like to send SEAL Team Six busting through the doors of whoever authorized the Colonial Pipeline hack. Or maybe a Hellfire missile through the sunroof of some hacker godfather’s Lexus. Many Americans would likely agree and favor similar treatment for robocallers and email spammers, which sounds good until you remember that this would involve U.S. troops carrying out military actions on the soil of Russia or its satellites.<br />One universal prescription for every kind of mishap is resilience. The Jones Act, a foolish, century-old law that reserves domestic ship-borne trade for U.S-crewed ships, is anti-resilience. If gas station owners weren’t bound by anti-gouging laws, they likely would never run out of gas. They’d jack prices high enough to persuade their customers that filling up every jerry can and topping off the Tahoe when it’s three-fourths full isn’t so necessary after all.<br />As with the SolarWinds hack, the public can expect to be scantily informed about the Colonial Pipeline hack compared with other major crimes and news events. News outlets can only speculate that the hack started with a typical email phishing scam. If so, this would be good to know. If the vulnerability in the overwhelming number of cases now is a human being clicking on an email link or foolishly confiding a password, then we are making progress on system security. The weak point is us.<br />Colonial has said its pipeline shutdown was precautionary, hinting that malware didn’t infect its industrial controllers. This would explain a few things. Hackers likely don’t know much about the companies they’re attacking—might have had little idea what Colonial does or that freezing its HR and customer accounts data might lead to gasoline shortages on the East Coast. Don’t dismiss the weird statement from a presumed Russia-associated hacking group apologizing for the Colonial complications and “creating problems for society.”<br />All sophisticated national governments and many that aren’t sophisticated operate continually in the cyber sphere, collecting intelligence, engaging in cyber operations. Let’s not kid ourselves about this. The U.S. tends publicly to disclose Chinese and Russian hacking exploits, perhaps because our system is more open but also likely for strategic reasons: Hiding such attacks, perversely, connotes weakness. Try to think of a case where Moscow or Beijing owned up to or publicized a cyber intrusion at the hands of the U.S. It’s not because such intrusions don’t happen. In all likelihood, the U.S. is the biggest, baddest cyber actor out there and these governments don’t want to advertise their vulnerability to their own citizens.</td>

      <td>The upbeat former presidential candidate is a frontrunner to become New York’s next mayor.</td>
      <td>Brooklyn, N.Y.<br />The few small polls that track New York’s mayoral election show Andrew Yang shaded into second place. Yet rivals at the first Democratic debate on Thursday treated him as the candidate to beat. Shaun Donovan, a former Obama cabinet member who’s trailing badly in the polls, went so far as to accuse Mr. Yang of not loving “citywide composting” enough. The debate was that picayune.<br />Mr. Yang’s appeal isn’t hard to explain—up to a point. He’s the only one of an eight-person Democratic field whose photo needs no identifying caption. Every American who follows politics knows who he is, thanks to his quixotic—but not charmless—run for president in 2019. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams—the tenuous mayoral front-runner, with 19% support to Mr. Yang’s 16%—is unknown to most New Yorkers. The other six could walk down Broadway without turning a single head—even after a televised debate.<br />A frisky, upbeat arriviste stands out in a herd of longtime public servants and activists. These include Mr. Adams, a former cop; Scott Stringer, the city’s comptroller; and Kathryn Garcia, a former sanitation commissioner (whom Mr. Yang has said he’d hire to work for him if he becomes mayor). There’s also another nonpolitico: Ray McGuire, a former  Citigroup  executive who polls in the single digits. Amid candidates who pay obeisance to all the leftist pieties—with occasional exceptions from Mr. Adams—Mr. Yang purports to offer a palate-cleansing alternative. While everyone at the debate brandished the view that New York is a hostile place for minorities, Mr. Yang steered clear of racial ululation. That may prove attractive to voters who are tiring of lectures on “equity.”<br />Mr. Yang might have had reason to feel relieved at the debate. He went into battle under a cloud of his own making, with a little help from New York’s Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Three days earlier, he tweeted that he “condemned Hamas terrorists” and stood with “the people of Israel” in its current state of siege. Hours later, he was dodging fire from AOC, who called his statement “utterly shameful.” Other critics lit up  Twitter  with a #YangSupportsGenocide hashtag, an incongruous charge to hurl at a nerdy start-up-guy who made his modest fortune running a GMAT prep company.</td>

      <td>The U.S. IPO market, unstoppable for nearly a year, has hit a speed bump.<br />Shares of rapidly growing companies have fallen increasingly out of favor with investors. Many newly listed firms, whose stocks rose after their initial public offerings, have dropped below their IPO prices. At least three companies, leery of jumping into a volatile stock market, postponed their IPOs after the S&P 500 started the week with its biggest three-day swoon in nearly seven months.<br />Some investors and bankers think next week could be a turning point. If the stock market calms and the public debuts of celebrity-backed Swedish oat-milk maker Oatly Group AB and software company Squarespace Inc. go well, that could shore up confidence in IPOs, they say. If volatility continues and those offerings sputter or get postponed, the IPO market could pump the brakes.<br />“Volatility makes deals more harrowing to launch,” said Eddie Molloy, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at  Morgan Stanley .  “Ultimately what we’d like to see is stability in the markets and see deals perform and hold their performance. Investors making money off of the latest deal is always helpful for the next deal.”<br />For the past 11 months, that has been the case. The IPO market, which raised a record $168 billion in 2020, has already raised a staggering $158 billion in 2021, according to Dealogic data through Thursday, the latest available. But the tides turned recently as fears of inflation came into focus and caused investors to seek havens outside of growth companies.</td>

Researchers have long argued that they need to study a wider variety of the plant to know if it can be effective in alleviating pain, fighting seizures, combating depression and relieving post-traumatic stress.<br />“This is a monumental step,” said George Hodgin, a former Navy SEAL who has been waiting more than two years for his business, Biopharmaceutical Research Co. in Monterey, Calif., to receive permission to conduct studies. “This type of long-term thinking from the government will allow companies like ours to pioneer a federally legal cannabis market for products that are tested and approved to help the public.”<br />Steven Groff, a physician in York, Pa., said he intends to study whether cannabis can be used to kill bacteria and viruses such as drug-resistant staph infections. DEA officials contacted him Friday to let him know he had been selected.<br />“We will be growing research cannabis to sell to the whole world for the first time,” said Dr. Groff, who has an 80,000-square-foot growing facility. “I know the power of this plant, but we need to find some data to back it up.

It will likely be especially difficult in public settings like stores or workplaces, health researchers say, since there isn’t an easy way to determine who is fully vaccinated.<br />“There are states that I believe will continue to require masks in public spaces, simply because we cannot tell who is vaccinated or who is not,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers someone fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of the  Pfizer Inc.  and BioNTech SE or  Moderna Inc.  vaccines or two weeks following the single dose of the  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine.</td>

Matt Gaetz and other Florida political figures, according to court documents filed Friday in federal court.<br />Joel Greenberg, who resigned as Seminole County tax collector last June, will plead guilty to one count of sex trafficking involving a person under 18 years old, along with counts of wire fraud, identity theft and stalking, according to an 86-page statement of facts filed by federal prosecutors. The plea agreement requires Mr. Greenberg to cooperate in the investigation—which is being run out of Florida and Washington, D.C.—including the “prosecution of other persons.”<br />The investigation is looking at whether Mr. Greenberg, an associate and political ally of Mr. Gaetz, arranged for sexual encounters between the Florida Republican congressman and young women, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Investigators are looking at whether Mr. Gaetz violated sex-trafficking laws, the Journal reported.<br />“Congressman Gaetz has never had sex with a minor and has never paid for sex,” a spokesman for Mr. Gaetz said.<br />A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Florida didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>

      <td>Boris Johnson says June reopening could be in jeopardy as country races to vaccinate more people</td>
      <td>LONDON—The U.K.’s plans to cast off almost all public-health restrictions next month are in peril after a highly contagious coronavirus variant first identified in India sparked new clusters of Covid-19, highlighting the risk of outbreaks even in countries where vaccination is widespread.<br />Prime Minister Boris Johnson said some restrictions in England would be eased Monday as planned, but a bigger reopening scheduled for late June is under threat unless the spread of variant B.1.617.2 can be brought under control. More than 1,200 cases and four deaths had been linked to the variant in the U.K. as of May 12, after it hitched a ride among returning travelers.<br />British scientists now think B.1.617.2 is more transmissible than B.1.1.7, which was first detected in the U.K. last year and has since spread around the world, England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty said Friday, referring to evidence including the variant’s genetic mutations, the growth in cases and modeling of its potential spread. Exactly how much more transmissible B.1.617.2 is isn’t yet known. “That will have implications for the prospects of this epidemic in the U.K. and internationally,” Prof. Whitty said.<br />With more than two-thirds of adults in the U.K. vaccinated, the outbreak makes the U.K. a test case for the U.S. and other big nations for how effective vaccines are at keeping all the variants of the coronavirus at bay. The shots aren’t 100% effective at stopping the pathogen in its multiple forms and the U.K. immunization drive hasn’t yet reached all age groups, leaving millions of potential hosts.<br />“The race between our vaccination program and the virus may be about to become a great deal tighter,” Mr. Johnson said Friday.</td>

His “Carolina Shout” became a test piece among professional pianists and set new standards of virtuosity and musicianship.<br />Johnson (1894-1955) spent his early years in New Jersey and moved to Manhattan when he was 14. He listened intently to church hymns and to ring shouts, dance music whose call-and-response patterns traced back to West Africa. Born with perfect pitch, he played and sang for school assemblies and minstrel shows, studied classical piano, attended New York Symphony concerts and idolized cabaret and sporting-house pianists. By age 18, he himself was playing at casinos, brothels and cabarets and was winning piano-playing contests.</td>

      <td>Generation Z is lonelier than millennials and more reluctant to embrace the responsibilities and joysof adulthood. Life online seems to be a reason.</td>
      <td>San Diego<br />Moral panic about the young is at least as old as the trial of Socrates, so let’s resist catastrophic thinking about Generation Z and begin with good news: The generation born between 1995 and 2012 is far more risk-averse and more physically safe than its elders. It is more tolerant of other races and sexual orientations. Most surprising, in the early months of the pandemic lockdowns that often took a toll in mental health, this generation managed to show an improvement.<br />In a survey of eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders conducted in May through July 2020 by the Institute for Family Studies and the Wheatley Institution, only 17% reported feeling depressed while school was in session and 20% while it was out for the summer, compared with 27% in a similar survey during the school year in 2018. Loneliness declined to 22% with school in session and 27% in the summer from 29% in 2018. Unhappiness and dissatisfaction with life rose, but not as sharply.<br />Why? “Two reasons,” says the study’s lead author, Jean Twenge—an academic psychologist who specializes in “iGen,” a term she coined for the first generation to grow up amid ubiquitous iPhones. First, without commuting and with few extracurricular activities, they slept more: “Sleep is crucial for mental health.” Second, spending more time with their families was good for them. Forced to stay home, quarantined around the dining-room table with parents and siblings, their time online held steady, and the added in-person time conferred significant mental-health benefits.<br />Yet this improvement proceeds from a low base; Generation Z exhibits higher rates of suicide and depression since studies began in 1950 and far higher rates of general pessimism than any generation dating to 1960. According to Ms. Twenge’s research, between 2005 and 2017 rates of major depression increased 52% in adolescents (12 to 17), and 63% in young adults (18 to 25).</td>

      <td>Neutral application of property law becomes an international incident because a landlord is a Jew.</td>
      <td>Hamas never needs a special occasion to bombard Israel with rockets. Yet the progressive narrative connects the terrorist group’s current onslaught to eviction proceedings in Israeli courts concerning a few properties in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren claim these are stark human-rights violations by the Israeli government, and illegal under international law. Even the State Department expressed “serious concern.”<br />The truth about Sheikh Jarrah is the opposite. It is an ordinary property dispute between private parties. The Jewish claimants’ ownership of the few plots of land has been confirmed repeatedly in court, following laws that apply equally regardless of ethnicity. Israeli courts have gone out of their way to avoid evicting the Palestinian residents who haven’t paid rent for half a century.<br />In the case now before Israel’s Supreme Court, the owner is an Israeli corporation with Jewish owners whose chain of title is documented back to an original purchase in 1875. Until 1948, the neighborhood now known as Sheikh Jarrah was home to both Jewish and Arab communities. Jordan invaded Israel in 1948 and occupied half of Jerusalem, expelling every one of its Jewish inhabitants and seizing their property.<br />When Israel reunited Jerusalem and ended the Jordanian occupation in 1967, it had to decide what to do with these properties. In the many cases in which Jordan had officially transferred the title of Jewish-owned properties to Palestinians, Israel respected the new titles—and still does—even though they are based on forcible takings in a war of aggression followed by ethnic cleansing against Jews. Where title had never been transferred, however, Israel returned properties to their owners. Critics of Israel claim that Arabs can’t recover property under the same law, but the law is entirely neutral—it is simply the case that Jordan took property from Jews, not Palestinians.<br />Title to the properties in dispute in Sheikh Jarrah was never given by Jordan to Palestinians, so Israeli law respects the unbroken title of the plaintiffs. This case has nothing to do with ethnicity or religion. The only discrimination in the legal treatment of Sheikh Jarrah property is historic, by Jordan, and against Jews to the benefit of Palestinians.</td>

      <td>Modern computing has sought to mimic the error-correction success of the natural world, and quantum weirdness may now provide new solutions</td>
      <td>Nobel Prize-winning physicist Frank Wilczek explores the secrets of the cosmos. Read previous columns here.<br />Precision is a powerful tool, but it can be hard to come by. That theme, with variations, is a leitmotif of science, organic life and modern technology. It is sounding again today, at the frontier of quantum computing.<br />Consider biology. Complex organisms store their essential operating systems—instructions for how to build cells and keep them going—within long DNA molecules. Those basic programs must be read out and translated into chemical events. Errors in translation can be catastrophic, resulting in defective, dysfunctional proteins or even in cancers. So biology has evolved an elaborate machinery of repair and proofreading to keep error rates low—around one per billion operations. A series of complicated molecular machines examine the progress and correct mistakes, in a process aptly called proof-reading. The creation of this machinery is one of evolution’s greatest achievements.<br />Many applications of computers also need precision. (For instance, in bank transactions it’s important to get passwords and transfers exactly right!) Modern computer technology came into its own when small, reliable solid-state transistors became available. Here, the basic distinction between “0” and “1” gets encoded in two alternative locations for buckets of electrons. When there are many electrons per bucket, errors in the position of one or a few don’t spoil the message.<br />But in doing computations the computer must move the buckets around. Making those buckets of electrons smaller makes the job of moving them around easier. Indeed, the computer industry’s spectacular record of ever-faster speed is largely the story of lowering the number of electrons used to make a bit; nowadays we’re approaching ten or fewer. Unfortunately, at this frontier the near error-immunity that stems from having many “redundant” electrons is less automatic. To maintain nearly error-free, precise operation, new tricks will be necessary.</td>

      <td>An artist known for folk-inspired songs has released her first cabaret album, recorded at Manhattan’s swanky Cafe Carlyle.</td>
      <td>In an ordinary year, Suzanne Vega would have followed up the release of her latest album, “An Evening of New York Songs and Stories,” by going on the road. “It was my intention that once I started to tour to promote the album I would have this new look and this new attitude,” she says. “But we never quite got that opportunity.”<br />Recorded in 2019 at Cafe Carlyle, the storied New York cabaret room, “Evening” came out last September, in the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now Ms. Vega has finally been able to announce a new tour of Northeastern cities starting in September, but she’s not sure which of her many musical personas will be on stage. “By the time we get to the end of the pandemic, I may be ready to try some other thing,” she says. “But on the other hand, maybe I’ll get that dress out of the closet.”<br />Ms. Vega’s reputation as an experimental, adventurous artist dates back to 1990, when her third album, “Days of Open Hand,” was struggling to get attention. “The record had no traction,” Ms. Vega recalls with a laugh. “Nobody liked it or wanted to hear it,” even though her previous album, “Solitude Standing,” had gone platinum thanks to the hit single “Luka.”<br />One day, she remembers, she was taping Arsenio Hall’s late-night show when her manager appeared backstage and told her that two British producers had made a bootleg remix of “Tom’s Diner,” an a cappella track from “Solitude Standing.” A&M Records was about to file a lawsuit to have the song pulled, but he thought she might want to hear it first. Ms. Vega put on headphones and immediately loved the remix, which spun a driving dance beat around her original vocal. Her song was transformed in a way that embraced and enhanced the original. “I thought it sounded really cool and suggested that instead of suing these kids, we buy the track and put it out,” Ms. Vega recalls. “That worked out great.”<br />“Tom’s Diner” 2.0, released by “DNA featuring Suzanne Vega,” became an international smash that took Ms. Vega into dance clubs and continues to get frequent play. She followed up that success with two sonically adventurous albums, “99.9F°” and “Nine Objects of Desire,” which stand as high points of 90s alternative music. Both albums were produced by Mitchell Froom, whom Ms. Vega married. Their daughter Ruby Froom, now 26, sometimes sings with her.</td>

      <td>The highest-ranked small and midsize colleges in the West are both among the top 10 schools of any kind nationwide in the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings, and the region’s top large colleges include five of the country’s top 10 public schools.<br />The WSJ/THE rankings are based on 15 factors across four main categories: Forty percent of each school’s overall score comes from student outcomes, including measures of graduate salaries and debt burdens, 30% from the school’s academic resources, including how much it spends on teaching, 20% from how well it engages its students and 10% from its environment, a measure of the diversity of its students and faculty.<br />Schools with fewer than 3,000 undergraduates are considered small in these rankings, those with 3,000 to 10,000 undergrads are midsize and those with more than 10,000 are large.<br />The top small college in the West is the California Institute of Technology, ranked No. 7 among all schools nationally. Two other small schools in the region are among the top 50 colleges nationally, Pomona College at No. 24 and Claremont McKenna College at No. 35.<br />The region’s top midsize school is Stanford University, ranked No. 4 among all schools in the country. The next-highest-ranked midsize school in the West is Santa Clara University, at No. 83 among all schools nationwide.</td>

      <td>“TRADITION IS GREAT, but I don’t think you should be beholden to it,” said chef Rashida Holmes. “It’s fun to play.” In her final Slow Food Fast recipe, spiced and fried whole red snapper, a dish with Caribbean roots, is sauced with a mango chimichurri of the chef’s invention. “I love the way the mango’s acidity works with the spices,” she said.<br />Before cooking the fish, Ms. Holmes rubs on an aromatic paste of garlic, ginger, turmeric and other spices. After a quick fry in a shallow pool of oil, the snapper is crisp on the outside, succulent and flaky within; frying it whole guards against overcooking.<br />Ms. Holmes recommends using a heavy pan for frying and leaving the fish alone until its crust sets. If some seasoning falls off as you flip it, no worries. A good dollop of mango chimichurri will cover up any inconsistencies. Forgiving, visually impressive and full of vibrant flavor, this will make a stunning dish for the return of dinner parties. But it’s also quick and low-pressure enough for any weeknight.<br />WSJ+ Members: Sign up for a seafood cooking class with Rashida Holmes here.<br />—Kitty Greenwald is a chef, food writer and the co-author of ‘Slow Fires’ (Clarkson Potter)</td>

      <td>Food prices are sky high, restaurants don’t have enough workers and shoppers are sending clothes back too fast for apparel makers to keep up. Labor shortages and production bottlenecks are weighing down companies just as the economy begins to surge again.</td>
      <td>A revival in the U.S. economy is driving up demand for everything from plane tickets to dinner reservations. Many companies that stand to benefit can’t keep up.<br />Diners are streaming into restaurants but owners can’t find enough people to cook or serve their food. People are shopping for cars in record numbers but dealers can’t fill their lots. Americans are getting back on planes but the future of the more lucrative business of ferrying international and business travelers remains in doubt.<br />The reasons companies are struggling to cash in on the surging demand range from labor shortages and supply-chain woes to an uneven global recovery from Covid-19.<br />The checkered nature of this economic resurgence is a fresh challenge for certain corners of the business world, particularly restaurants and retail, that are playing from behind. After a lost year, they can’t afford a lost opportunity as the country reopens. On Thursday federal health officials said fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear a mask or physically distance in most settings, the fullest easing of pandemic recommendations so far.<br />Here is how the disjointed recovery is playing out, and what each industry is doing about it.</td>

      <td>Don’t wonder why U.S. retail sales missed expectations in April. Wonder how strong they will be in coming months as the Covid pandemic fades.</td>
      <td>U.S. retailers took in about as much money in April as they did in March. You should actually be impressed.<br />The Commerce Department on Friday reported that retail sales—spending in stores, at restaurants and online—was unchanged last month from March, adjusting for seasonal swings. That was short of the 0.8% gain economists were looking for, but then again, the March sales increase from a month earlier was revised to 10.7% from 9.8%.<br />That March gain was fueled by the arrival of the latest round of stimulus checks from the government which, in concert with the easing of the pandemic, gave many Americans the wherewithal and the willingness to spend more.<br />An analysis conducted by  Bank of America  economists on their firm’s credit and debit-card data shows that it was poorer people—those that by nature have the most unmet needs—who increased their spending the most in March. They have since settled down.<br />Yet for sales to merely be flat after a surge like March’s, particularly in the midst of a monthslong recovery, is somewhat remarkable. Compare it with, for example, the pattern that followed the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. That October, sales rose 6.7% from a month earlier, then fell 2.5% in November and kept dropping over the next two months.</td>

      <td>KABUL—A blast at a Sunni mosque on the outskirts of Kabul killed at least 12 people on Friday, Afghan officials said, wrecking a three-day cease-fire that was declared between the government and the Taliban during the Muslim Eid holiday.<br />The Afghan government didn’t immediately comment on the attack. The Taliban denied a role in the bombing and blamed the Afghan government.<br />The attack was the first major outbreak of violence in Kabul after a triple bombing at a girls’ school last weekend in a Shiite neighborhood of the Afghan capital. Those blasts killed at least 85 people, including many children, Afghan officials said.<br />While mosques attended by members of the country’s Shiite minority have been repeatedly targeted by the regional Islamic State affiliate and other militants, Friday’s was the first such attack on a Sunni place of worship in months.<br />Afghans increasingly fear the U.S. military withdrawal, slated to be completed by September, could tip the country into a renewed conflict along sectarian lines.</td>
