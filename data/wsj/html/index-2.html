      <td>The U.S. and European Union are applying pressure on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with Washington planning sanctions over Turkey’s acquisition of a Russian air-defense system and the EU targeting people involved in Ankara’s energy exploration activities in the eastern Mediterranean.<br />The EU measure, approved by leaders at a Brussels summit, put a temporary end on fissures within the bloc over how to deal with Mr. Erdogan’s assertive military moves in the region and his push for energy resources in waters claimed by the bloc’s members, Greece and Cyprus. The EU compromise stopped short of adopting broader economic sanctions requested by some of its member countries.<br />The U.S. is also expected to impose sanctions on Turkish entities, in this case in response to Ankara’s acquisition of the advanced S-400 Russian-made air-defense system, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />U.S. officials are expected to roll out the sanctions Friday under a 2017 U.S. law for procuring weapons from a blacklisted supplier, the person said. The State Department reiterated its policy of declining to comment on future sanctions.<br />Despite pressure from some lawmakers, the Trump administration had held back on sanctions over the missile system, although President Trump said last year the U.S. would withhold sales of advanced F-35 stealth jet fighters to Turkey.</td>

Mr. Barr has staved off pressure from Republicans in Congress for information into the investigations, the person said, without elaborating on his actions.<br />One investigation became public this week after federal investigators served a subpoena on Hunter Biden. The subpoena sought detailed financial information in connection with a criminal tax investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Federal prosecutors in Manhattan had also been looking at Hunter Biden’s business and financial dealings, as part of a broader criminal investigation that two people familiar with the matter described as an international financial investigation that had been going on for at least a year. Hunter Biden is implicated in that investigation but was never a specific target for criminal prosecution, the people said. They declined to provide details on the substance of the probe.<br />The federal scrutiny dates back to 2018, the people familiar with the matter said.</td>

      <td>The feds want a do-over for acquisitions they previously approved.</td>
      <td>Facebook ’s  motto in its early days was to “move fast and break things.” That’s also one way to describe the Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Facebook that was seconded this week by 46 state Attorneys General. That so many lawyers could come up with such a weak legal case is remarkable.<br />CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t have many political friends these days in either party. He has been criticized for restricting speech on his platform both too much and too little. Facebook has helped to destroy the advertising market for newspapers, and the world might be better off without it.<br />But the purpose of U.S. antitrust law isn’t to remedy social or political problems. That’s essentially what the FTC on a 3-2 vote and the AGs are seeking with their lawsuits that asks courts to force Facebook to divest its Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014) acquisitions.<br />According to the FTC complaint, Mr. Zuckerberg sought to buy Instagram and WhatsApp to neutralize competition. Well, sure. “It is better to buy than compete,” Mr. Zuckerberg emailed in 2008. Any business must adapt as technology and consumer tastes change. Mr. Zuckerberg saw how smart phones increased photo sharing and private instant messaging.<br />It was less expensive and easier for Facebook to acquire apps than build copycats. But bigger companies buy upstarts all the time. Note also that Instagram and WhatsApp were complementary apps to Facebook, not direct competitors. Many people use parallel social-media platforms with distinct features such as TikTok,  Twitter ,   Pinterest ,  Reddit and Snap.</td>

      <td>Guess who’s Goya’s “Employee of the Month?” The honor goes to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), who famously supported the boycott of Goya Foods earlier this year after CEO Robert Unanue visited the Trump White House as part of a Hispanic Prosperity Initiative.<br />Mr. Unanue broke the news Monday during an interview with “The Michael Berry Show.” “When she boycotted us, our sales actually increased 1,000%,” Mr. Unanue said. “So we gave her an honorary. We never were able to hand it to her, but she got employee of the month for bringing attention to Goya and our adobo.”<br />Ms. Ocasio-Cortez now denies that she ever called for a boycott, tweeting that all she did was tweet about learning to make her own adobo, and that any suggestion otherwise is a matter of Fox News indulging in “their made up fantasies.” Adobo happens to be one of Goya’s most popular seasonings and her search for an alternative came in the thick of the boycott calls. CNN reported at the time that “Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet that she’d boycott Goya.”<br />We’re glad that Mr. Unanue, who pointed out he’d participated in similar initiatives for Barack and Michelle Obama, never backed down and his company wasn’t harmed. Maybe the Congresswoman needs a better sense of humor.</td>

      <td>Can a state be harmed by the way other states conduct their elections?</td>
      <td>Ken Paxton, the Texas Attorney General, seems intent on developing a name for himself as the patron saint of lost legal causes. He’s the father of the recent and long-shot case against ObamaCare, and this week he launched another implausible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn state presidential election results.<br />In Texas v. Pennsylvania, Mr. Paxton, joined by 17 other states and President Trump, claims that four states have harmed Texas by violating their election laws in ways that poisoned the result. He wants the Court to take the case directly, in “original jurisdiction,” and order the legislatures in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia to overturn election certifications for Joe Biden.<br />The Court asked the four states to reply by 3 p.m. Thursday, but it would be a legal and political earthquake if the Court took the case. Cases of original jurisdiction—when a state bypasses lower courts and goes directly to the Supreme Court—are rare and typically involve interstate disputes. This one concerns election law in states other than Texas.<br />The first issue is whether Texas has the legal standing to sue. To have standing, a plaintiff must point to a specific injury and there must be some possibility of a remedy. In this case, what is the injury? No one is interfering with Texas’s authority to deliver its Electoral College votes.<br />Mr. Paxton argues that the four states have harmed his state and violated the Electors Clause of the Constitution by holding elections with major procedural irregularities. He’s saying Texas can be harmed by the way another state manages its elections. But if Texas can sue on these grounds, then some unhappy state will sue another state after every close election whose outcome it doesn’t like.</td>

      <td>The story the press ignored returns in time for Joe’s Presidency.</td>
      <td>So Hunter Biden’s business is news after all. Who knew? Well, the New York Post did, and so did we and a few others.<br />But in October when the Post broke the story of an email, allegedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop, referring to a meeting he’d arranged between his father and an executive from a Ukrainian energy company, Democrats and most of the press told Americans it was Russian disinformation. The story was banned on  Twitter .  But with the election over, presto, even CNN’s Jake Tapper is a born-again bloodhound.<br />That is itself a scandal. When the younger Mr. Biden’s business relationships first surfaced—e.g., his highly paid position on the Burisma corporate board, despite no background in Ukraine or energy—it should have provoked serious reporting. Instead, the people who spent years claiming Donald Trump was a Russian agent ignored much stronger evidence that the younger Mr. Biden had been getting rich on his father’s name. He sometimes traveled to business meetings as a tag-along with his Vice President dad on Air Force II.<br />These latest reports are no surprise to Sens. Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley, the chairmen of investigating Senate committees. In September they released a joint report detailing some of Hunter’s million-dollar dealings with politically connected foreigners. The report said they raised “serious counterintelligence and extortion concerns relating to Hunter Biden and his family.”<br />The press yawned. One who did not was our Kimberley Strassel. On Oct. 22 she wrote a column headlined “The Biden ‘Family Legacy,’” based on email and texts between Hunter and business partner Tony Bobulinski that suggest Joe Biden’s son knew exactly what he was cashing in on. At one point he reminded Mr. Bobulinksi that the heads of CEFC China Energy, a Shanghai-based conglomerate closely entwined with the Chinese government, are “coming to be MY partner to be partners with the Bidens.”</td>

      <td>Judiciary will have the last word on bipartisan allegations that Facebook illegally maintains a monopoly</td>
      <td>The sweeping government antitrust lawsuits against  Facebook Inc.  laid down a new bipartisan marker for enforcement after years of hesitancy, but they will be tested by a federal court system that has proved skeptical of broad antitrust intervention.<br />The lawsuits, filed Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission and 46 states, allege the social-media giant illegally preserved a social-networking monopoly through a years-long campaign of freezing out potential rivals and buying nascent competitors such Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook vowed a vigorous court battle, saying its acquisitions made those apps better. It accused the government of attempting to rewrite history.<br />The cases come amid a national debate about whether a handful of tech companies have become too dominant—and whether antitrust enforcers should have done more to police powerful firms and concentrated industries. Criticism of the FTC and Justice Department, which share antitrust authority, has come from Democrats and Republicans alike.<br />The agencies, however, can’t impose their will by fiat, and must instead prove their cases in court. With the current calls for more enforcement, the DOJ and FTC have shown more willingness to test those waters. Weeks before the Facebook suit, the Justice Department and 11 states brought an antitrust case against Google. More states may join soon with additional claims against the search giant.<br />The last few years, however, also showed the pitfalls antitrust enforcers face with the courts, which have become more conservative and have weakened antitrust precedents in recent decades. In August, a federal appeals court ruled the FTC didn’t prove that  Qualcomm Inc.  unlawfully preserved a monopoly in cellphone chips. A New York federal judge in February rejected a bid by a group of state attorneys general to block  T-Mobile US Inc.’s  takeover of Sprint Corp.</td>

      <td>Waiting on the Covid booster would allow more people to be vaccinated sooner.</td>
      <td>Recent days brought good news and bad news about coronavirus vaccines. The developments could add up to months of delay in getting most Americans inoculated. But there’s a way to make use of the good news to speed up herd immunity.<br />The bad news is that in July the U.S. passed up an opportunity to secure by June 2021 more than 100 million doses of the  Pfizer  vaccine, now expected to receive emergency-use authorization in the next few days. Instead, officials followed a balanced-portfolio strategy that reserved as many as 300 million doses of the  AstraZeneca  vaccine, whose prospects are unclear.<br />The good news is that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines performed at the upper end of expectations, with 95% efficacy after two doses. And intriguingly, Pfizer’s submission to the Food and Drug Administration shows that the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing disease had largely kicked in by two weeks after the first dose, and there was no dramatic increase in efficacy after the booster was given three weeks later.<br />The protocol in Pfizer’s clinical trial was to give all participants two doses. The FDA is likely to approve this protocol, and standard procedure is to prescribe a drug according to protocol. But we are in a pandemic and supplies of vaccine are inadequate. There’s an alternative: vaccinating as many people as possible with a first dose and waiting on the booster until supplies are plentiful.<br />The Pfizer study wasn’t designed to put a number on first-dose efficacy, but the data in Pfizer’s “cumulative incidence curves” suggest at least 75% efficacy for two weeks after one dose. The question is whether to use the 100 million doses on 50 million people, of whom two doses would protect roughly 47.5 million, or to give one dose each to 100 million people and protect at least 75 million.</td>

      <td>Whether American forces stay or leave, the fighting is guaranteed to continue. Why not cut our losses?</td>
      <td>It was the shot of a lifetime. A lone Taliban fighter, armed with a cheap rocket-propelled grenade launcher, had destroyed the enormous surveillance blimp tethered to our patrol base. The $500 rocket tore through the blimp from end to end, obliterating $25 million of vital cameras and sensors. The explosion sounded like the sky itself was being ripped apart.<br />The destruction of the blimp left our little outpost vulnerable at the worst possible moment. The long-planned withdrawal of U.S. Marine units from northern Helmand province was scheduled to begin in weeks. Preparations had been under way for months; the impending operation was no secret to either side. Robbed of our critical eye in the sky, we braced ourselves for what we assumed was the next step in an audacious Taliban plan to maximize our casualties as Marines and allies withdrew from our patrol bases to the relative safety of Camp Leatherneck, a few hours drive south.<br />Our worst fears never materialized. That cold winter of 2013 witnessed the largely undisturbed departure of thousands of American and allied troops from Afghanistan’s deadliest province. In the end, the Taliban chose to keep most of their powder dry, conserving resources to fight their fellow Afghans rather than sacrificing fighters in high-profile but tactically meaningless attacks against departing foreigners.<br />In the rest of Afghanistan, whenever American troops finally do depart for home, a similar scenario is likely to play out. Yet President Trump’s decision to commence a new Afghanistan troop drawdown has prompted bipartisan outrage. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth raised the specter of more “Americans in body bags,” while Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio invoked the chaos of Saigon in 1975. Retired generals and journalists added their voices to the chorus, condemning this supposedly precipitous withdrawal. But our own experience suggests that this consternation is overblown.<br />Mr. Trump’s troop drawdown may well be politically motivated, but it also reflects a realistic appraisal of the facts on the ground. The Taliban are increasingly ascendant on the battlefield; they now control or contest nearly half the country. Civilian casualties in October were the highest in more than a year. Continued civil war is likely to be the next chapter of Afghanistan’s story, whether U.S. forces stay or leave.</td>

      <td>Advent and Epiphany are also holy days. Why not call them all what they are?</td>
      <td>The season of good tidings often brings an awkward moment. It has happened in the checkout line, on a phone call, during a quick conversation with a neighbor. I’ll say, “Merry Christmas.” The other person will respond, “Happy holidays.” Tranquility turns to tension. A simple exchange of well wishes ends uncomfortably.<br />But this year will be different. I’m going to say “happy holidays”—not only in response to others but as my default December greeting. Far from being an effort to avoid religious language, I’ve come to understand that the phrase is inherently religious and respectful.<br />Many of the evangelical Christians I grew up with, and the Catholics whom I have since joined, feel hesitant about “happy holidays.” Sometimes that hesitation becomes outright hostility. This attitude comes from the justifiable fear that Judeo-Christian traditions and cultural trappings are being swept away by a secular tide. Language has the power to shape what we believe and think, the argument goes, so abandoning the word “Christmas” speaks to a broader abolition of the Christian faith in the public square.<br />There’s no doubt that secularism is rising, and plenty of Americans say “happy holidays” to steer clear of religion, although many others use it to be inclusive of other religious traditions, including Hanukkah.<br />Yet those two words can’t be divorced from the reality of the Christmas season. Drawn from Old English, the word holiday is a combination of “holy” and “day.” It is an unwitting acknowledgment that this is, in fact, a transcendent season. As far as season’s greetings go, the phrase seems warm and true and perfectly apt.</td>

      <td>A British neurologist explores his passionate identiﬁcation with the reckless adventurer Percy Harrison Fawcett.</td>
      <td>Like the late Oliver Sacks, Andrew Lees is a British neurologist who is also a talented writer of memoir, medical reportage and travelogue. Like Sacks, who died in 2015 at 82, Dr. Lees has made personal eccentricity into something of a cottage industry. A sense of oddness informs Dr. Lees’s books, perhaps even more so than those of Sacks, whose signature volumes, such as “Awakenings” and “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,” at least tempered their strange sensibility with mass-market appeal.<br />But the chief lure of Dr. Lees’s books—and their abiding complication—is that they defy easy classification. This was surely true of “Mentored by a Madman,” a 2017 account of how the drug-addled beat poet William Burroughs shaped Dr. Lees’s research into Parkinson’s disease. It’s equally the case with “Brazil That Never Was,” which chronicles his obsession with the vanished British explorer Percy Harrison Fawcett.<br />Fawcett disappeared in 1925 while searching for a legendary lost city along the Amazon. His exploits were the subject of David Grann’s popular 2009 biography “The Lost City of Z,” which was adapted into a 2016 film. But it was an earlier book about Fawcett that first got Dr. Lees’s attention.<br />After Fawcett’s disappearance, his son Brian, hoping to keep his father’s flame alive, published “Exploration Fawcett” (1953), billed as a collection of the explorer’s own writings about his previous adventures. Dr. Lees wonders to what degree Brian Fawcett had a hand in shaping the text, which seemed to anticipate Indiana Jones in its vivid depictions of danger narrowly escaped in exotic locales.<br />Whatever the provenance of “Exploration Fawcett,” it became a seminal scripture of Dr. Lees’s childhood as he grew up in the West Riding of Yorkshire in the 1950s. After Dr. Lees’s father recommended to him a library copy of the book, the young boy was hooked. “Fawcett challenged me to travel with him to intangible worlds,” Dr. Lees recalls, “where everything was connected to everything else and the unfathomable was within reach . . . The evenings that I spent reading Exploration Fawcett were as alive as any I can now remember. It was as if the book had chosen me, rather than the other way round.”</td>

      <td>A diagnosis of entitlement culture, the story of populist radio and more of the year’s standouts.</td>
      <td>Christopher Caldwell’s “The Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties” (Simon and Schuster, 352 pages, $28) appeared in January, before the George Floyd riots or the coronavirus panic, but a careful reader of this penetrating study of postwar America might have foreseen the reckless lunacy occasioned by both events. Mr. Caldwell contends that, with the passage and signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the nation’s leaders established a new de facto constitution under which the purpose of politics was to remake civil society according to enlightened theories of racial justice. American leaders set about erecting enormously powerful and cripplingly expensive government agencies and programs to guarantee a state of racial equality. When their efforts failed, their successors created more such agencies and programs, and cultivated the destructive social convention known as political correctness to punish dissenters.<br />Both Republican and Democratic leaders, Mr. Caldwell contends, believed they could spend endless billions on a doomed enterprise and accrue no societal cost; they were bound, or “entitled,” to succeed. Over the past several months we’ve seen American elites blame the cops for a half-century of their own policies’ failure and shut down the bulk of the private-sector economy as if the government doesn’t need it to make everything run. The Age of Entitlement is still very much in progress.<br />America’s wealthy and educated classes come in for another condign drubbing in Michael Lind’s “The New Class War: Saving Democracy From the Managerial Elite” (Portfolio, 203 pages, $25). Mr. Lind is far, I believe, from being a Marxist, but his account of 2016’s populist revolt feels to me like economic determinism. What makes his book work so brilliantly, though, isn’t so much his economic interpretation of our political quandary as his acid analysis of “technocratic neoliberalism.” One salient component of that worldview, Mr. Lind writes in a passage I particularly relished, “is to medicalize politics and treat differing viewpoints as evidence of mental and emotional disorders.” Hence the “phobia” suffix: Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia and so on. This habit of mind he finds as far back as Richard Hofstadter’s 1964 essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” surely among the most overrated and malign political compositions of the 20th century.<br />Was there ever a time when comity and reasonableness prevailed? Well, perhaps; but as Paul Matzko reminds us in “The Radio Right: How a Band of Broadcasters Took on the Federal Government and Built the Modern Conservative Movement” (Oxford, 304 pages, $34.95), distrust and acrimony were always part of American politics, too. The birth of modern American conservatism is usually attributed to William F. Buckley Jr., Frank Meyer and other midcentury intellectuals; Mr. Matzko insists that it began with a band of anticommunist and fundamentalist radio broadcasters in the 1940s and ’50s. In the ’60s radio personalities such as Carl McIntire and Billy James Hargis began delivering daily invectives against President John F. Kennedy’s Soviet policies to millions of listeners. That led the president and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, to seek a means of retaliation, which they found in a plan drawn up by a pair of communist-sympathizing labor leaders, Victor and Walter Reuther.<br />Not only did the Kennedy brothers implement a scheme of government-empowered intimidation against their critics; the National Council of Churches got in on the bullying, too. “The Radio Right” is an impressively researched and lucidly written work of scholarship.</td>

      <td>From picture-book travels to fantastic adventures, a treasure-filled year of reading.</td>
      <td>Four of the year’s best picture books have waterways—real, metaphorical, man-made—that wind through them, taking young readers on empathetic journeys of imagination. In “Birrarung Wilam” (Candlewick, 40 pages, $17.99), the waterway is a real one, Australia’s Yarra River, which gathers itself from tributaries far inland and runs through the city of Melbourne to the sea. The text of this exceptional book, by Aunty Joy Murphy and Andrew Kelly, has an incantatory magic, mingling English and the Aboriginal language of Woiwurrung: “As ngua rises, turning clouds over the distant city red . . . Birrarung begins its long winding path down to palem warreen.” What do all these words mean? Children will be able to guess from what they see in Lisa Kennedy’s evocative and rough-feeling paintings (see above). They can also check the glossary at the back. This is a marvel for reading aloud, a dreamlike sojourn through a distinctive riverine ecology.<br />The chattering, churning, whirling waters of Jordan Scott’s autobiographical picture book “I Talk Like a River” (Holiday House, 40 pages, $18.99) exist both inside and outside its young narrator, a boy who suffers from a debilitating stutter. “At school, I hide in the back of the class. I hope I don’t have to talk,” he tells us. “When my teacher asks me a question, all my classmates turn and look.” In sublime and poignant paintings, Sydney Smith shows the child’s struggle, his misery and shame—and then the glorious, sun-dappled afternoon when his father uses an example from nature to transform the boy’s understanding of himself: “I talk like a river.”<br />With enigmatic black-and-white illustrations, “The Wanderer” (Levine Querido, 96 pages, $21.99) takes readers on a gorgeous, wordless odyssey from one side of the world to another. Peter Van den Ende’s intricate drawings follow a little paper boat as it travels through oceans and seas teeming with wonders: undulating monsters, playful mermen, and aquatic creatures that resemble elephants, cheetahs and medieval jesters. Wandering, the vessel moves beneath starry skies, passing ice floes and oil rigs until, at last, it enters the waters of a moonlit canal, where a mysterious passenger disembarks. Given the absence of text, the book may seem accessible to readers of any age, but its sophistication makes it best suited to those over the age of 8.<br />Rivers unfurl like pretty ribbons across distant landscapes in “If You Come to Earth” (Chronicle, 80 pages, $18.99), a beautiful and quirky picture book by Sophie Blackall that’s styled as a child’s letter to a visitor from outer space. “There are more than seven billion people on Earth,” the narrator explains. “You can’t see our thoughts, but sometimes we show our feelings on our faces.” The illustrations for these musings have all the humor and delicacy that make Ms. Blackall’s work so distinctive (see left): wry lines and marzipan hues in tableaux that abound in seek-and-find interest. With an innocent as narrator—“Some things are part of nature. Some things are made by people”—this open-hearted book exalts the commonplace, making ordinary things seem remarkable.<br />Rivers aren’t a big feature of the year’s best illustrated chapter books, but water, ice and snow do figure in “The Silver Arrow” (Little, Brown, 259 pages, $16.99), a sparkling fantasy adventure story by Lev Grossman, with pictures by Tracy Nishamura Bishop. When an 11-year-old girl receives the gift of a steam locomotive, she and her little brother soon find themselves thundering into the magical unknown. Become conductors, they acquire train carriages—some filled with books, some with candy—and punch the tickets of chatty animal passengers.  Jaunty and wise, “The Silver Arrow” makes for a particularly fine read-aloud.</td>

      <td>From far-flung worlds to an eerie setting close to home, our columnist picks this year’s stellar reading.</td>
      <td>For sci-fi fans of a certain age, nothing was more welcome in 2020 than Eric Flint and Dave Freer’s “The Shaman of Karres” (Baen, 292 pages, $25), the third sequel to James H. Schmitz’s “The Witches of Karres,” now 70 years old and still a candidate for the best space-opera ever. “Shaman” follows the adventures of the Leewit, the youngest of the witches, whirling through space with hapless Captain Pausert on the trail of a new alien threat, one worse than the Megair Cannibals or the nanite menace. This time it’s a strange creature with powers of mind control, so insidious the controlled don’t even notice. Pure fun from the past, with just a touch of satire, all updated and with added invention. Who can resist the Daal of Uldune, a six-clone hexaperson, who is also a ruthless tyrant trying to go straight? Until, that is, his chivalrous instincts are stimulated and the gloves come off.<br />Nostalgia of a different kind is invoked by Christina Henry’s “The Ghost Tree” (Berkley, 432 pages, $16). No star-jaunting here, instead the scenario is what Ray Bradbury used to call “October country”: midwest, small town, scent of leaves burning, perfect peace. But there’s a chill in the air, Halloween is coming on and the town has closed ranks around a deadly secret. Just like the faeries of ancient folktale, the inhabitants pay an annual toll of sacrifice, and no one must speak of it. Memory of the missing is wiped out—except in 14-year old Lauren, a prime target for whatever hides in the ghost tree. It’s grimmer than Grimm, with teenage angst and rebellion included.<br />Christopher Paolini’s “To Sleep in a Sea of Stars” (Tor, 878 pages, $29.99) is quite unaffected by the weight of the past. Mr. Paolini cares nothing for the impossibility of faster-than-light travel, and has a unified field theory to back him up. But if you venture to the stars, you must be ready for First Contact, and then First Combat, and then it’s Star Wars, with the Jellies and the Nightmares and the Old Ones all mixing in. Further complexity comes from the heroine Kira, who is no longer just human now that she’s made contact with an alien mind. Mr. Paolini develops his ideas outside the story in a number of appendices. Sci-fi has always loved what some call “paratext”: future histories and fake quotations tucked in around the sides so you can get information across without putting a drag on the story. Mr. Paolini has so many ideas, that’s what he has to do.<br />Star-hopping is great, but, realists will object, we haven’t so much as got a colony on the Moon yet. And, sci-fi fans will chorus, we darned well should have by now! In “The Relentless Moon” (Tor, 542 pages, $17.99), Mary Robinette Kowal imagines a world where we did indeed try a bit harder over the last 50 years, and did what we could have done. If, that is, we’d had the kick in the pants delivered by a major asteroid impact in Chesapeake Bay. Maybe that would have made us realize that here on Earth we’re living in a giant pinball game. So we could have trained some female astronauts, given NASA some common sense and taken care of the politics at home as well as the tech in space. Not that the tech is not a problem, as Ms. Kowal shows in this truly relentless exposition of how to promote, and also sabotage, the best-planned of lunar initiatives.<br />Heroic fantasy may be the favored genre these days, but urban fantasy still has a lot going for it. Richard Kadrey’s “Ballistic Kiss” (Harper Voyager, 349 pages, $28.99) continues the adventures of “Sandman Slim,” a private investigator of the supernatural, based in Los Angeles. In previous volumes Slim has served his time in Hell and even acted as a stand-in for Lucifer. But as he points out, surviving Hell is one thing, L.A. is another.</td>

      <td>A thriller of World War II Paris, the return of Inspector Gamache and more of the year in crime fiction.</td>
      <td>Cara Black has earned a loyal following with her series starring Parisian investigator Aimée Leduc. This year, Ms. Black showed a new facet of her talent with the historical thriller “Three Hours in Paris” (Soho Crime 348 pages, $27.95). It’s the ticking-clock saga of Kate Rees, a sharpshooting American war widow trained by the British and smuggled into Paris in 1940 to assassinate the leader of Nazi Germany. The reader assumes Kate will miss her shot at Adolf Hitler—this is not alternative history—but what surprises is what comes next. Kate makes contact with Resistance operatives in a race to elude a German policeman tasked by the Führer himself with her swift capture.<br />“The Bramble and the Rose” (Norton, 198 pages, $25.95) is Tom Bouman’s third novel featuring rural Pennsylvania police officer Henry Farrell. An introspective loner, Henry approaches a personal and emotional epiphany after learning of a grisly crime: a headless corpse found in a forest. Was the victim, an out-of-town private eye, killed by a bear or a man? And what brought the victim to this neck of the woods? Henry teams up with Mary Weaver, a biologist, to hunt for a rogue animal who may or may not have acquired a taste for human flesh. “A man-killer isn’t stupid,” she explain. “It stalks its prey in absolute silence. . . . Most survivors never hear or see it . . . until it’s less than fifty feet away. And if it has a taste for man, harsh words won’t stop him.”<br />Cormoran Strike, the detective hero of an enjoyable series of books by Robert Galbraith (a pen name for J.K. Rowling), has his most complex adventure yet in “Troubled Blood” (Mulholland, 933 pages, $29). This hefty volume is stuffed with intrigue, surprise, action, violence, social comedy and romance: “value for money,” as the British say. It starts with a cold case: the disappearance some 40 years ago of a doctor whose daughter still wants to learn what happened. “The truth’s out there,” Strike promises. But time, fate and other folk seem to conspire against Strike and his business partner, Robin Ellacott. The ongoing dramas in the two investigators’ own families also threaten to lead them astray. But our pseudonymous author sorts everything out by the end with the skill of a world-class storyteller.<br />A cellphone swiped from a lawyer striding through New York’s Grand Central Terminal triggers the infernal plot-machine of Patrick Hoffman’s “Clean Hands” (Atlantic Monthly, 280 pages, $26). The phone is loaded with confidential information pertaining to a high-profile lawsuit between two banks. Getting the phone back is vital. But was the theft genuine? The lawyer’s boss calls on Valencia Walker, an ex-CIA case officer, to put out the blaze, but the blaze keeps spreading. Street-level crooks lead to smalltime hoods who point to bigger gangsters—all the way up the criminal food-chain to where everything must converge. “It just seems,” Valencia finally says, “like this might be one where it would be better if everybody would just stand down.” But is it too late for that?<br />Joe Ide’s novels about Isaiah “IQ” Quintabe, a young private investigator in East Long Beach, Calif., are among the most inventive and smartly written books in the genre. “Hi Five” (Mulholland, 341 pages, $27), IQ’s fourth case, is his most unpredictable yet. An illicit arms dealer hires him, under threat of breaking his violinist girlfriend’s fingers, to solve the murder of the crook’s daughter’s boyfriend, a killing for which the daughter stands accused. Complicating matters further, the daughter is a multiple personality; IQ must prove each of the defendant’s five “alters” innocent to save his girlfriend’s digits. All in a week’s work for this Holmesian avatar in a gritty Southern California suburb.</td>

      <td>The impulse to constantly check phone screens for bad news only got its name in the last few years</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />Of all the words that came to prominence in 2020, one that truly seems to capture the zeitgeist of our dreary times is “doomscrolling.”<br />If you’ve spent any time on social media this year, you know the feeling. As Wall Street Journal Personal Tech columnist Nicole Nguyendefined it back in June, “doomscrolling” refers to “spending inordinate amounts of time on devices poring over grim news.” The phenomenon became all too common when the coronavirus pandemic kept people cooped up, as so many of us obsessed over the endless stream of depressing updates.<br />Despite the pessimism that the word encapsulates, “doomscrolling” is a lexical success story. By year’s end, it merited mention in a report from Oxford Languages, the publisher of the Oxford English Dictionary, on how the pandemic has profoundly shaped the lexicon. “Doomscrolling,” the report said, “typified the realities of the new normal” and “expressed poignantly the language changes brought on by the pandemic.”<br />The portentous sound of the word may have heightened its impact, drawing on centuries-old connotations of the word “doom.” Derived from Old English “dom” meaning “judgment,” it has long fused with other words to make compounds like “doomsday” for the final reckoning in the Judeo-Christian tradition. In the mid-20th century, “doomsayer” emerged as a bleaker version of “soothsayer,” for one who predicts calamities. “Doomsaying” may have provided a kind of model for both “doomscrolling” and a related neologism, “doomsurfing.”</td>

Yet a breakup would also be complex, requiring potentially years of engineering work on top of legal wrangling.<br />Months before the FTC suit, Facebook called divestment of the apps “a complete nonstarter” in a briefing document, saying that disentangling them would result in diminished products, weaker security for user data and billions of dollars in redundant spending.<br />In a memo sent to employees on Wednesday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the lawsuits would take years to play out, and said he believed the company would prevail in court.</td>

      <td>SÃO PAULO—Joseph Safra, a Lebanese-Brazilian billionaire who built an international financial empire and financed a hostile takeover of Chiquita Brands International that took the business world by surprise, died Thursday here in Brazil’s business capital. He was 82.<br />Mr. Safra, ranked by Forbes as Brazil’s richest man with an estimated net worth of $23.2 billion, died of natural causes at the Albert Einstein Hospital, according to Banco Safra, the bank he made into one of Latin America’s most prominent. He was heir to a banking empire that began financing camel caravans in the Middle East and grew into a transnational business that includes banking, bananas, real estate and other interests.<br />His banking influence spanned from Latin America’s largest economy to the U.S. and Europe. Though he was reserved and shunned the spotlight, Mr. Safra and his brothers, Edmond and Moise, were well known for having built up the Banco Safra, the Safra National Bank of New York and the J. Safra Sarasin Bank in Switzerland by catering to ultrarich clients and elite companies. Though discreet, the Safra family is credited with helping shape global banking.<br />“He was a great banker, a true entrepreneur who built the Safra Group in the world, achieving success for his seriousness and business vision,” a statement from the Safra Group, the financial conglomerate he controlled, said. “He was a great leader and very respected inside and outside the organization.”<br />Mr. Safra arrived in Brazil in his 20s, brought here with his brothers from Lebanon by his father, Jacob, who had opened a bank in Beirut. The arrival of the Sephardic-Jewish family came in the wake of World War II, at a time when Israel had been founded and persecution of Beirut’s Jews had flared.</td>

Dozens of people are unaccounted for. Here is what we know so far.<br />A giant explosion at a warehouse in the port sent a shock wave through east and downtown Beirut at about 6 p.m. local time on Aug. 4. Videos of the blast posted on social media showed smoke billowing from the warehouse on the waterfront before a massive explosion produced a dome-shaped cloud that engulfed large parts of central Beirut. The force of the blast did tremendous damage to the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby buildings. The homes of tens of thousands of people were damaged by the blast.<br />Authorities say the blast occurred when a fire at a warehouse—Hangar 12—on the city’s waterfront ignited a cache of ammonium nitrate, an explosive material that had been stored at the site for more than six years.<br />Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound most commonly used in fertilizers. It is also used to make explosives and was used in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.<br />The Lebanese government is facing questions about why the explosive chemicals were stored at the port. A judge leading an investigation into the blast has charged caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab and three former ministers with negligence in relation to the blast. Mr. Diab has denied any wrongdoing. The former ministers couldn’t be reached for comment. Many Lebanese blame years of poor governance and corruption by the entire ruling elite for the explosion.</td>

      <td>Bobby Jindal is correct in “Can GOP Find Its Way on Health Care?” (op-ed, Dec. 3). The goal of a Republican plan should be to provide any person who is sick or injured with the appropriate care in the appropriate setting at the appropriate time in the management of any illness or injury, with emphasis on preventing illness or injury whenever possible. This will take away the one central issue on which the Democrats have held the advantage, access to care.<br />Republicans favor a market solution to the vexing problem of health-care system reform but have been unable to articulate a simple, easily understandable vision to implement that solution.<br />The solution should be based on three principles:<br />1) Expand the choices. There are many different, imperfect ways to finance care and many different, imperfect ways to deliver care. Each has advantages and disadvantages. The Democrats argue for top-down central control of health care. Republicans recognize the potential of choice to create competition between imperfect mechanisms to drive down cost and drive up quality.<br />2) Give individuals the opportunity and the responsibility to choose and own their own plan with the periodic right to change if dissatisfied with the previous choice.

If you are borrowing for a business, you must have a credible business forecast and collateral. Yet for a degree with low earnings potential, you can borrow to the hilt.</td>

But critics say it unfairly assigns blame for a disaster many see as the culmination of years of bad governance by the entire ruling elite rather than one individual.<br />Judge Fadi Sawan is set to question Prime Minister Hassan Diab on Monday, according to the Lebanese state news agency NNA. Former Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil and two former ministers of Public Works, Ghazi Zeaiter and Youssef Finianos, were also charged and will be interrogated next week.<br />The Prime Minister’s office responded saying Mr. Diab’s conscience was clear. “He is confident that his hands are clean and that he has handled the Beirut Port blast file in a responsible and transparent manner,” it said.<br />Protests forced Mr. Diab to resign in the wake of the explosion on Aug. 4, but he is still serving in a caretaker capacity because the political class has failed to agree on a new cabinet.</td>

The day’s fourth decision dismissed on procedural grounds a challenge to Delaware’s unique requirement for partisan balance on the state courts.<br />The no-fly case brought together two sometimes different legal threads on the Supreme Court: a conservative push to expand protections for religious expression and the liberal interest in accountability for misconduct by law enforcement.<br />Three Muslim men, a U.S. citizen and two permanent residents, alleged that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents pressured them to serve as informers on fellow Muslims. After they refused, the agents retaliated by placing them on the no-fly list, a secret roster of people U.S. authorities forbid from boarding commercial aircraft over terrorism concerns.</td>

Under the newly announced rules, it could take two or three days, he said.<br />Covid-19 has killed about 180,000 people in Brazil so far, second only to the U.S. The average daily death toll peaked at more than 1,000 people in July and had steadily been in decline, but a sharp rise over the past few weeks has raised concerns about a possible second surge in the country.</td>

Mr. Sarkozy insisted, to the surprise of his contemporaries, that religion must have some serious role in French society. His endorsement was strongly seconded by Pope Benedict XVI who both in France and the U.S. spoke of a “healthy secularism,” one in which the government, while always maintaining its autonomy, recognized the spiritual and transcendent dimension of humanity.

      <td>Net new supply of new bonds could hit the lowest level since 2002 next year—a potential headache for bond fund managers</td>
      <td>The record corporate borrowing boom fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pandemic response may be coming to an end. Wall Street bankers and investors are preparing for a sharp drop in corporate bond sales next year.<br />Companies with investment-grade credit ratings will likely issue $1.1 trillion of new bonds in 2021, a 32% reduction from this year, according to research by  Barclays  PLC. Many are flush with cash after borrowing to bolster their balance sheets through the pandemic’s economic shutdowns.<br />The anticipated decline becomes even sharper after accounting for expected debt repayments, which offset new bond sales. Analysts at  Bank of America Corp.  forecast that net new corporate bond issuance will be $63 billion next year. That would be the lowest total since the bank began tracking it in 2002.<br />The Fed has eased borrowing conditions throughout the pandemic by dropping interest rates near zero, saying it expects to keep them there for years, and by implementing other measures, such as buying corporate bonds for the first time. The efforts have helped keep the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below 1% for months. It settled Thursday at 0.907%, according to Tradeweb.<br />A steep decline in bond borrowing would be a sign that corporate chieftains feel less need to buffer balance sheets and that they will be spending some of the $2.1 trillion amassed earlier this year. For portfolio managers, it would be a mixed blessing: A declining supply of new bonds would drive up prices of those investors already own, but make it tougher to find new securities to buy with the cash that continues to pour into bond funds.</td>

To put that in perspective, the Obama administration increased the debt by $8.6 trillion over eight years.

While some participants might find jobs at Amazon, it is more likely they would get hired at other companies, including many that use Amazon Web Services, the online retailer’s cloud division.<br />The free training could support those looking to prepare for entry-level support positions or in helping existing engineers broaden their expertise in areas like machine learning or cybersecurity, the company says.<br />Teresa Carlson, a vice president at Amazon Web Services, says the company hears almost daily from its clients that they can’t find the right people to fill technical jobs as many organizations move their applications and processes to the cloud.</td>

A decision about whether to hear the case likely will follow as soon as Thursday afternoon or Friday.<br />In the filing, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accuses the four states of “rampant lawlessness,” claiming they violated their own election laws when officials adjusted voting procedures to process mail-in ballots, which millions of voters employed to comply with public-health guidance to reduce transmission of Covid-19. Texas contends that in making such accommodations, the states violated federal constitutional provisions that direct state legislatures to determine the “manner” of appointing electors.<br />Mr. Trump called the lawsuit “the big one” in a tweet Wednesday. “The Supreme Court has a chance to save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States,” the president tweeted Thursday.</td>

Mr. Johnson’s public pessimism and the EU contingency plans laid out Thursday reflect a mutual assessment that an accord might not be reached in time.<br />In a video clip issued by his office Thursday, Mr. Johnson indicated there was a good chance the negotiations would fail. “We need to be very, very clear there is now a strong possibility—a strong possibility—that we will have a solution that’s more like an Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU,” Mr. Johnson said.<br />An Australian relationship is the term the British government has increasingly used to describe the two sides trading with no trade agreement but under terms laid out by the World Trade Organization. That would impose customs duties on goods such as food, clothing and cars that have traded tariff-free between the U.K. and the EU since 1973.</td>

Nearly all the equipment he needed fit neatly into a couple of rolling cases. “It’s a reminder that you don’t need all that stuff,” he said. “If you have a story and you have good actors, with the technology now you can make something that looks amazing for nothing.”<br />Here, the director talks film homework and the price of making movies.<br />What I look for as a filmmaker is: freedom and momentum. Shooting on an iPhone gave me that. I wanted the ability to put a lens anywhere in seconds.

While Brent started the year above $65, its recent rally shows how hopes for coronavirus-vaccine distribution and economic-stimulus programs are helping to heal global energy markets.<br />Oil has risen in tandem with stocks and other commodities in recent weeks, part of a broad market rally fueled by investors’ anticipation for a 2021 global economic resurgence. Buoyant demand from China also is boosting oil prices after the world’s largest commodity consumer largely contained the pandemic.<br />Traders are now hoping that travel picks up in the U.S. and Europe next year, boosting energy consumption while large suppliers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries remain disciplined with production cuts.<br />OPEC and allies including Russia agreed to modest output increases last week, instilling faith that the group won’t bring back supply too quickly and adding momentum to the oil-price rally.

The film, showing in select theaters before its debut on Netflix later this month, gets a boost from the gravity of Earth’s plight. In the past it was easier to see end-of-civilization sagas as entertainment. Now, at a time when the United Nations secretary-general has called the state of our planet “broken,” a movie like this one hits closer to home. That’s not to suggest it is nothing more than a cautionary tale. Mr. Clooney and his colleagues have crafted an elegant screen version of a novel by Lily Brooks-Dalton with a resonant performance at its center—his own.<br />He plays Augustine, an aging scientist and the last person left at an Arctic observatory after a catastrophe, described only as “a mistake,” has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. Grievously ill and dependent on blood transfusions that he manages himself, he turns down an offer of evacuation in order to face his solitary fate. But Augustine’s isolation doesn’t last. He’s jolted by a status-board notification of the astronauts’ impending return from deep space; they’ve been away for two years, exploring a planet for possible colonization, and have no idea what has happened at home. Then he’s startled by the sudden appearance, right there in the observatory kitchen, of a little girl in a yellow dress and sneakers. (She’s played delightfully by Caoillin Springall, who was only 6 years old at the time of production.) Who is she? Was she left behind by evacuees? Impossible to know, because she doesn’t speak, and no way to ask, since all communications are down.<br />Solitude—existential and seemingly implacable—provides the film’s theme; the urgent human need to break out of it provides the action. The astronauts, including Ms. Jones’s Sully and David Oyelowo’s Adewole, the mission commander, don’t understand why they can’t reach mission control or anyone else on Earth. Augustine can’t tell them what happened, let alone warn them off. When a radio link is finally established it quickly fails, prompting the scientist to embark—yes, with the little girl bundled up in a parka—on a perilous trek to another Arctic station with a stronger transmitter.<br />That’s the most suspenseful part of the film, but also the most conventional, a sort of “Revenant Redux.” (No accident, since the screenplay was written by Mark L. Smith, who adapted “The Revenant” with its director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu; Mr. Smith’s adaptation here is, in the main, astute and admirably spare.) The most affecting part is Augustine’s reaching out to the space ship, with its precious human cargo. He’s had one quasi-fatherhood thrust upon him by the mysterious child, who draws a flower to tell him that her name is Iris; another father-daughter relationship is implicit in his desperate concern for Sully, whose fate becomes intertwined with his own.<br />Seeing Mr. Clooney in the role is a shock. Gone is the jauntily handsome figure we’re accustomed to. Augustine is weary, frightened, regretful of a loveless past evoked in flashback, and just plain old, with a beard so luxuriant it looks animated. He is also, now and then, warm and funny. It won’t give away too much to tell you that Augustine and Iris can’t connect fully until, sharing a wordless dinner that includes potatoes and green peas, they line up their peas on the table, then flick them at each other like kids shooting marbles.</td>

      <td>The net worth of U.S. households rose to a record in the third quarter as the value of stock portfolios and real estate surged, a Federal Reserve report showed, highlighting the skewed nature of an economic recovery that has disproportionately benefited wealthier Americans.<br />Household net worth rose 3.2% in the third quarter from the second quarter to $123.52 trillion, the Fed said Thursday. Household debt rose 5.6% to $16.4 trillion, its fastest pace in at least two years.<br />Stock-market gains have driven much of the increase in net worth. The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 8.5% and 7.6%, respectively, in the July-September period, building on even bigger advances in the second quarter.<br />Many economists have described a K-shaped recovery from the coronavirus-induced shock early this year. More affluent Americans are doing well, while millions of others—including lower-paid workers in vulnerable jobs in retailing and restaurants—are seeing their incomes and net worth decline.<br />“We’ve seen home prices rise, market prices for tradable instruments rise and savings increase because people haven’t been able to spend money on everything from sporting events to weddings,” said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG LLP. “But those gains skew to upper income people.”</td>

      <td>In Will Arbery’s singular, sympathetic play, young conservative intellectuals gather to discuss their post-graduate lives and political concerns in the age of Trump.</td>
      <td>Will Arbery’s “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” was one of the most talked-about plays of 2019, and I fully intended to review Playwrights Horizons’ New York premiere in this space. Unfortunately, a family crisis made it impossible for me to do so, and the coming of the pandemic subsequently prevented regional theaters from taking up the play. I’ve been crossing my fingers ever since that somebody out there would mount a webcast version. Now Philadelphia’s Wilma Theater, one of the East Coast’s leading drama companies, has taped a fully staged site-specific production of “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” at a private location in the Poconos, turning the cast and crew into a closed quarantine “bubble” so that they could work together face-to-face instead of taping their performances separately via Zoom or green screens. The result, which looks more like a small-scale movie than an online webcast of a stage show, is a flawless, impressively well-cast production of a work of singular distinction, one for which the word “remarkable” is, if anything, an understatement.<br />The play, directed by Blanka Zizka, is set in rural Wyoming in 2017. It centers on Emily (Campbell O’Hare), Kevin (Justin Jain) and Teresa (Sarah Gliko), who are in their mid-to-late 20s and are meeting at the off-the-grid shack of Justin (Jered McLenigan), a somewhat older but like-minded man. The young people are all in the familiar process of discovering themselves, but there is nothing else ordinary about them: They are conservative Catholic intellectuals-in-the-making who have been girding themselves for battle in the coming culture wars.<br />Kevin and Teresa went to the same school, Transfiguration College, and have come to Justin’s house to meet with Gina (Mary Elizabeth Scallen), Emily’s mother and Transfiguration’s incoming president, and tell her about their post-graduate lives in the age of Trump. Like them, Transfiguration is very unusual, a school where, as Teresa says, “you got wilderness training, where you spoke conversational Latin and locked your phone in a safe for four years.” Not surprisingly, it produces alumni who make casual mention in bull sessions of Martin Heidegger and “my gal Flannery O” (that’s O’Connor to you), ask each other questions like “How’s your soul? Is it in peril?” and believe it to be the destiny of those unwilling to do battle with the rise of postmodern secularism to degenerate into “a throbbing mass of genderless narcissists….Everyone working for any business or public school will be frog-marched through diversity and inclusion training. It won’t just be about tolerating, which we do, it will be about affirming their disorder. Which is a sin.” Notwithstanding their avowed religious conservatism, though, the characters have mostly come to view Donald Trump with skepticism, even though they all supported him in 2016, albeit unenthusiastically (“After I voted for Trump I vomited next to my car”).<br />Part of what makes Mr. Arbery’s play so good is that its characters are portrayed on their own terms. No one shows up at evening’s end to make these-people-are-100%-evil noises meant to calm the horrified audience. (I would love to know what Tony Kushner, a wholly different kind of playwright but one from whom Mr. Arbery appears to have learned valuable lessons, made of it.) While I feel sure that many of those who saw “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” in New York found the characters, not entirely without reason, to be potentially dangerous extremists, they are far more complicated and interesting than that, for life in urban America has nibbled away at their orthodoxies, and none of them now takes the carved-in-stone truths of Transfiguration College at face value. Not at all surprisingly, Mr. Arbery grew up in the kind of cultural environment he describes here, which makes it possible for him to portray it with the deep comprehension and distanced sympathy that give “Heroes” its dramatic power.<br />“Heroes” is a conversation piece that runs for 2 1/2 hours, and those with no appetite for intellectual talk will doubtless find it far too long. But it is a real play, not a pretentious gabfest, and Mr. Arbery is a greatly talented writer who has given us a drama as exciting and challenging—nay, daring—as any new play I’ve ever reviewed. I intend to see “Heroes” onstage as soon as the pandemic ends and it starts to be produced by regional theaters. Don’t wait for that, though: This is a play you must see, right now.</td>

A person familiar with Mr. Tarbert’s plans said he would retain his seat until he decides on his next move. His term expires in 2024.<br />That means Republicans will keep their 3-2 majority at the CFTC, possibly until 2022.<br />Republican commissioner Brian Quintenz hasn’t said when he plans to depart and is legally allowed to remain in the role until Jan. 3, 2022, according to a CFTC official.<br />Mr. Biden will likely appoint one of the commission’s two sitting Democrats—Dan Berkovitz or Rostin Behnam—as acting chairman while the Senate mulls an eventual nominee. But a Democratic chairman’s ability to pass tougher rules on banks, clearinghouses or derivatives traders would be held in check by the need to get at least one Republican vote.</td>

      <td>Steven Soderbergh’s microbudget, improvised comedy about old friends reuniting on a trans-Atlantic cruise stars Meryl Streep, Candice Bergen and Dianne Wiest.</td>
      <td>Making a studio feature can be arduous— relentless pressure, constant script revisions, the deployment of vast technical resources, the tyranny of marketing strategies. Any actor who values artistic freedom would jump at the chance to make a movie almost spontaneously, which is the way the HBO Max comedy “Let Them All Talk” was made, and to make it with Steven Soderbergh, a filmmaker with a special affinity for directing actors. And look who did jump: Meryl Streep, Candice Bergen and Dianne Wiest, three legends of our time. Mr. Soderbergh, serving as his own cinematographer, shot the film in two weeks on a microbudget; the main location was the luxury liner Queen Mary 2 during a trans-Atlantic crossing So how did such an adventurous production turn out? Not very well, though it’s certainly a curiosity, a chance to see what happens when superb performers improvise their lines in the absence of a conventional script.<br />Ms. Streep is Alice Hughes, a celebrated, and famously secretive, novelist who has just received a prestigious literary prize. But she’s in New York, the award ceremony will be in England, and she doesn’t fly. The problem is on its way to being solved when one of her agents, Karen (Gemma Chan), suggests that the Cunard Line might offer complimentary passage to Alice, and perhaps to several companions of her choice. (Unlikely? Hey, it’s a movie.) Seeing an occasion for some serious freeloading, Alice invites her nephew, Tyler (Lucas Hedges), and two college friends she hasn’t seen for at least 30 years—Ms. Wiest’s Susan, who advocates for incarcerated women, and Ms. Bergen’s Roberta, who sells brassieres in a department store. Thus is the stage set for a reunion, presumably fond, and for the trio to take stock of how far they’ve come in their mortal journeys and where they still hope to go.<br />How you feel about the film depends on how much sense you want it to make. What’s there for ready enjoyment is the spectacle of three women, no longer young, dishing about their lives and loves. There’s also a subplot involving Tyler and Karen, who has booked her own passage to spy on Alice and find out more about the novel she’s currently writing. (Fuzzy or improbable? Hey, it’s still a movie.) And at the center of it all is Ms. Streep’s literary lioness, at once witty, petty, vain, vulnerable, mercurial, manipulative and wise.<br />Those adjectives, though, are listed in no particular order of importance because it’s impossible to know who Alice really is in her heart of hearts, despite Ms. Streep’s beguiling efforts to sketch her in. And sketchiness is the film’s dominant quality because of how the story evolved. The writer and actress Deborah Eisenberg provided an outline, rather than a formal script, and discussed scenes with the actors during production as they improvised their dialogue.<br />Mr. Soderbergh, who directed one of my favorite films, “Out of Sight” (from Scott Frank’s brilliant screen adaptation of a terrific Elmore Leonard novel, I should add), has made a number of features, with varying success, that were partly or wholly improvised. This one, though, feels flat and slack, with scenes that drift off oddly, or aren’t there at all.</td>

Federal employees must generally preserve documents under the Federal Records Act.<br />Dr. Kent stated that she didn’t speak directly to Dr. Redfield about this instruction, but was informed that it came from him, explaining, “that’s what I understood, that it came from Dr. Redfield,” according to the letter.

      <td>Conflicts over political power and indigenous rights lie at the center of Sundance Now’s new drama.</td>
      <td>The physical and social backgrounds essential to this dark political tale exert their powers early. “Total Control” (begins Thursday, Dec. 17, Sundance Now) is a six-part drama set in the Australian Outback. A place, we’re shown, where people spend their days swatting at the flies circling their heads, and where conversation is dry and to the point, and jokey, though without cruelty. It’s the way of this society to be wary of strangers but not impossibly so, as one government representative discovers in episode 1, when he comes knocking on the door of a house in the small town of Winton. He’s met with suspicion by the woman who opens it—she quickly decides he’s a Mormon, seeking converts, and informs him that he’s wasting his time.<br />Still he’s invited in. The visitor explains that he’s looking for the woman’s daughter, who isn’t home yet, he’s informed. And so the two wait for her together. The visitor, who’s been supplied with tea and cookies, looks approvingly at the array of pictures on the wall, among them that of the queen.<br />“Ninety-three years old and never missed a day of work—now you show me someone else who will give that kind of service,” the lady of the house declares. Her visitor beams—he’s a massive fan of the queen, he informs her. The walls of this modest home are filled with mementos, testaments to experience, to memories, to a life lived. This scene—which comes less than five minutes after the horrifying dramatics of the show’s opening segment—is the first indicator that this series has something more on its mind than heroics and high principles. Something, for example, like recognizably human characters: for right here is a woman who clearly belongs in exactly such a category.<br />The lady of this house is Jan Irving (a memorable performance by Trisha Morton-Thomas), a member of Australia’s indigenous community, whose daughter is Alexandra Irving (Deborah Mailman), one of the two female characters at the heart of this tale. A place, it’s soon clear, that threatens to grow ever more crowded as the show’s various plot lines weave their way through the action, the most important of which concern Prime Minister Rachel Anderson (an elegant and persuasive Rachel Griffiths) and Alexandra. Another character shows up only briefly, but in the most haunting way—a young woman, alone, making her way in the dark through that vast lonely territory with just a knapsack. Where is she going, this young native woman who appears and disappears? She’s clearly an escapee from detention, a girl who carries with her the filmed evidence of guards administering a lethal punishment to her friend, another Aboriginal girl.<br />But the series amounts to far more than a catalog of injustices. (It was written by Stuart Page, Darren Dale, Ms. Griffiths and Miranda Dear. Director, Rachel Perkins.) It’s an enterprise mightily enlarged by its merciless focus on political combat, its depiction of longtime trusted alliances—they can die overnight, given the right impetus—its biting vision of the prevailing codes, and what passes for right and wrong in political society.</td>

      <td>Victor Kossakovsky’s documentary takes a sow as its subject to tell the story of agriculture and industrial farming.</td>
      <td>The star of Victor Kossakovsky’s “Gunda” is a pig. Gunda is her name, and lactating is her game; she’s a mammary mountain with what I counted to be 10 piglets on her slope. I had time to count piglets, and reflect on their lives and fate, because time flows slowly in this one-of-a-kind documentary feature, shot in luminous, almost magical-realist, black and white. It would flow at a turtle’s pace if the cast included turtles, but there’s only Gunda and her brood, plus a one-legged chicken who hops around a field with surprising grace and a small herd of cows, seemingly happy—or at least not unhappy—to be standing or sitting in the rain. These creatures are in no rush either. Watching them, you get some sense of their life rhythms while readjusting your own.<br />Last year I wrote about the vivid, almost hallucinatory images in Mr. Kossakovsky’s “Aquarela,” a documentary about water in all its power and various forms. Now he has turned his camera on the residents of a pigsty and the farm that surrounds it. (Actually filming took place on several farms and sanctuaries in Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom.) The filmmaker has a great gift for helping us to see, assuming that we’re willing to stick with a 93-minute film with no plot and no dialogue, only the presence of animals we’re accustomed to seeing as cute characters in commercial entertainments. (Think “Babe,” which I loved, or countless docs about pandas and penguins.)<br />The invisible element in “Gunda” is time, the unstated subject is the life these animals live—as individuals, not just animate objects—and the industrial processes that kill them. Mr. Kossakovsky’s film is ultimately political, a quiet polemic, even though the killing takes place offscreen; all we see is what Gunda sees, that one moment her piglets are there and the next moment they are gone. Pigs are smart. She’s surely aware that something terrible has happened. An improbably beautiful work of barnyard art, “Gunda” figures that we’re smart too.</td>

Angus King (I., Maine) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) were working on hammering out a deal on some form of limited protections, but it wasn’t clear how much GOP support their idea would draw, aides said.<br />For weeks, lawmakers have operated under the principle that any relief package would need to include some form of liability protections, long a top priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), as well as additional funding for state and local governments, a key condition of Democrats.<br />That pairing came into question this week. First, Mr. McConnell suggested dropping both measures from this package. Democrats rejected that tradeoff, arguing that liability protection wasn’t as urgent as aid to states and localities whose revenues have been hammered by the pandemic.</td>

Federal spending rose 9% to $887 billion during October and November from the same period a year earlier, while revenue declined 3% to $457 billion.<br />The Treasury said the deficit would have been even wider if not for calendar quirks that moved up the timing of certain benefit payments. If not for those timing issues, the deficit in October and November would have risen 47% from the same period a year earlier.<br />Higher spending to combat the coronavirus was driven largely by increases on safety-net programs. Spending by the Agriculture Department, which administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, rose 36%, while spending on Medicaid increased 16%. Labor Department spending on jobless benefits rose to $45.1 billion in October and November, compared with $3.7 billion during the same period a year earlier.<br />Federal tax revenue declined largely as a result of lower individual income tax withholding, which senior Treasury officials attributed to high levels of unemployment tied to the pandemic, and deferred payroll taxes the government authorized through the end of this calendar year. Individual withholding was down 4% in the first two months of the fiscal year, which started on Oct. 1.</td>

      <td>For Taylor Swift fans, Christmas is coming early: Ms. Swift on Thursday announced her ninth studio album, “Evermore,” which is the second unexpected release of the year for one of music’s most notoriously meticulous pop stars.<br />Released just five months after her intimate Grammy-nominated blockbuster “Folklore,” the new album, which Ms. Swift describes as “folklore’s sister record,” features many of the same collaborators, including The National’s Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff and Bon Iver. That continuity suggests a collection of “Folklore” leftovers and more songs written in a similarly hushed and folksy indie-rock vein.<br />“I’ve never done this before,” Ms. Swift said on social media. “In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore.”<br />“I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales,” she continued. “So I just kept writing them.”<br />The quick arrival of “Evermore” reflects a reality of today’s streaming-music economy: More is more. Like fellow pop star Ariana Grande, Ms. Swift has pivoted from carefully plotted-out releases to more spontaneous and less precious ones—borrowing from the playbook of hip-hop & R&B stars.</td>

      <td>Hunter Biden may have wanted to hold 10% for the “big guy,” but did he forget to set aside 37% for Uncle Sam? A tax investigation focused on the Biden family’s highly questionable sources of income may finally force them to answer precisely how such income is generated in the first place.<br />The Journal’s Ken Thomas and Sabrina Siddiqui report:<br />Exactly one year ago, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and six Democrats chairing House committees unveiled their plan to charge President Donald Trump with impeachment articles which did  not claim he had committed any crimes. Mr. Trump’s alleged offense was suggesting that a foreign government look into Hunter Biden dealings which any reasonable person would say deserved examination. A source now tells the Journal that the feds began investigating Biden taxes in 2018. One year ago today, did any of the congressional Democrats know that as they were accusing Mr. Trump of non-crimes, the subject of his scrutiny was already under U.S. criminal investigation?<br />And no, the investigation wasn’t manufactured by Mr. Trump, according to the Journal’s reporting:<br />Now why won’t Joe Biden’s office say when he learned about the investigation? Perhaps there’s a difference of opinion within the family about whether Tuesday is a plausible moment for the subject of a two-year-old investigation to learn about it.</td>

      <td>Investment is latest sign of mainstream acceptance for upstart digital currency</td>
      <td>Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. bought $100 million of bitcoin for its general investment account, the latest sign of mainstream acceptance for the upstart digital currency.<br />The investment is a tiny one for the Springfield, Mass.-based insurance company whose general investment account totaled nearly $235 billion as of Sept. 30. But it signifies further momentum for bitcoin, which has surged this fall. The price of a single bitcoin peaked in late November at $19,835, topping its 2017 high, and currently trades around $18,000, up 150% year-to-date.<br />MassMutual purchased the bitcoin through a New York-based fund management company called NYDIG, which has about $2.3 billion of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under management. MassMutual also acquired a $5 million minority equity stake in NYDIG, which was formerly known as New York Digital Investment Group.<br />The insurance company, founded in 1851, said the bitcoin investment was based on a broad strategy to take advantage of new opportunities while remaining diversified, “giving us measured yet meaningful exposure to a growing economic aspect of our increasingly digital world.”<br />Bitcoin, launched in January 2009, is a software program that operates across a network of linked but independent computers. It allows any two people to exchange value directly without the use of a middleman like a bank.</td>

      <td>Regulator says it isn’t necessary to extend precautionary action taken as the pandemic began</td>
      <td>U.K. banks can resume paying dividends next year after regulators ended a ban introduced in March to make lenders conserve capital during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The share prices of Britain’s biggest banks have been battered this year as they set aside billions of pounds in provisions for bad loans and curbed payouts to shareholders. Industry leaders including  Barclays  PLC Chief Executive Jes Staley and Santander Chairman Ana Botín in recent months urged regulators to allow them to start paying dividends again.<br />“An extension of the exceptional and precautionary action taken in March is not necessary,” the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority, or PRA, said in a written statement Thursday. “Any distributions should be prudent, reflecting the still elevated levels of economic uncertainty.”<br />Canceling dividends helped banks to shore up their balance sheets. The capital ratios of the U.K.’s biggest banks improved in the first half of 2020 even though they were hit with £18 billion, equivalent to $24 billion, of impairment losses, the Bank of England has said. The European Central Bank also asked banks to stop paying dividends earlier this year.<br />The dividend cancellations displeased many shareholders—particularly Hong Kong-based investors in  HSBC .  The London-based bank, which makes most of its profit in Asia, said in August that it faced lawsuits in connection with dividend cancellations.</td>

      <td>For five decades, under two very different regimes, Tehran has built up the infrastructure for a bomb but stopped short of making one</td>
      <td>Iran’s nuclear ambitions are again looming over a new American administration. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to resuscitate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that President Trump unilaterally discarded. But after four years of enduring sanctions and targeted assassinations, the Islamic Republic may no longer be listening. Some experts fear that Iran’s pragmatists—led by President Hassan Rouhani, who negotiated the nuclear agreement—have been discredited and that Iran’s hard-liners are too suspicious of the West to reengage with another American leader.<br />As usual, the debate in Washington misreads the realities in Tehran. For the past five decades, under two very different regimes, Iran has pursued essentially the same nuclear strategy. While many Westerners fret over the tussling between Iran’s moderates and hard-liners, the most striking aspect of Iran’s nuclear-arms policy over the decades is its consistency. Mr. Biden is trying to return to diplomacy at the precise time when significant arms-control breakthroughs are all but impossible.<br />Iran’s nuclear program ramped up in earnest during the 1970s, when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi concluded that his ambitions to dominate the region might require the ultimate weapon. In 1975, the shah told the  New York Times  that while he wasn’t seeking the bomb, “if 20 or 30 ridiculous little countries are going to develop nuclear weapons, then I may have to revise my policies.” In his chatty way, the shah was hinting at a nuclear hedging strategy: Iran would build a sophisticated nuclear infrastructure but defer assembling a bomb, depending on events in its dangerous neighborhood.<br />In 1979, Islamist revolutionaries overthrew the shah. The new theocracy destroyed much of the old order but proved protective of its nuclear inheritance. The Middle East was still a disorderly region, and the revolutionaries were as much Persian chauvinists as the monarch they overthrew.<br />Iran’s new clerical oligarchs never made nuclear ambitions a matter of factional dispute. The reformist President Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005) was as committed to the nuclear program as his reactionary successor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-13). Under the watchful eye of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the nuclear program didn’t fall prey to Iran’s poisonous domestic politics.</td>

On Thursday, Team USA signaled that it believes such a punishment shouldn’t happen again.<br />The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, backing the recommendations of a council on racial and social justice it helped form earlier this year, called for an end to the International Olympic Committee rule that prohibits protest at Olympic sites and venues.<br />“The USOPC values the voices of Team USA athletes and believes that their right to advocate for racial and social justice, and be a positive force for change, absolutely aligns with the fundamental values of equality that define Team USA and the Olympic and Paralympic movements,” USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland said. Team USA won’t sanction athletes for protesting at the Games in support of those causes, it said.<br />The announcement sets up a showdown ahead of next summer’s Tokyo Games between the world’s most powerful Olympic nation and the IOC, which has resisted relaxing protest rules on the biggest Olympic stages.<br />The IOC responded to a request for comment by sharing a statement from Kirsty Coventry, chair of the IOC Athletes’ Commission. She said the commission would consider the U.S. feedback and that of other nations’ athletes before providing recommendations to the IOC Executive Board. So far, the majority of athletes have said they want to preserve the Olympic podium and field of play, Coventry said.</td>

Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou at the behest of the U.S.—an incident that has embroiled Canada in a broader diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.<br />On Thursday, multiple media outlets reported that Messrs. Kovrig and Spavor, who were later indicted on espionage charges, had stood trial. The reports cited a statement from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, who said in a regular briefing that Chinese authorities had “carried out the arrest, indictment and trial” of the two Canadians, according to the Chinese transcript of the briefing posted on the ministry’s website.<br />The English transcript of the briefing, posted some time after the Chinese on Thursday, says the two Canadians “were arrested, prosecuted and will be tried.”<br />According to a spokeswoman from Canada’s Foreign Department, there has been “no development” in the two Canadians’ cases. The spokeswoman said that Canadian officials in Beijing spoke directly with the Chinese Foreign Ministry and said the confusion was the result of an “inaccurate characterization” of the process.</td>

      <td>These purveyors’ websites will deliver restaurant-quality seafood direct to the rest of us</td>
      <td>THERE’S NEVER been a better time to buy seafood online. With the crushing impact of the pandemic on the hospitality industry, seafood purveyors that once counted on wholesale business to restaurants and hotels have pivoted to direct-to-consumer online retail.<br />“It’s been survival mode,” said Peter Jarvis, president, CEO and chief fishmonger of Peter’s Florida Seafood. His company relied primarily on wholesale for 30 years, up until March of this year. Wholesale business in 2020 is still down by about 75% from what it was by this time last year, but online-retail sales of Florida stone crab claws and other fish caught in the state’s coastal waters have kept Mr. Jarvis in business and customers happy. “People are excited to get chef-quality seafood on a consistent basis, and it means a lot because they aren’t going out,” Mr. Jarvis said.<br />At Island Creek Oysters in Massachusetts, president Chris Sherman said, “We lost 98% of our core revenue overnight, which was selling oysters directly to top chefs around the country.” While Island Creek has run an online-retail operation as well for the last decade, “there were some years when it didn’t make sense to keep it going.” Beginning in March, that changed: “Within weeks of the shutdown, that [retail] part of the business really sprang to life.”<br />The companies below provide access to pristine seafood you would otherwise have to visit a restaurant to get. They’re transparent about their sourcing and vigilant about maintaining sustainable fisheries—though the profusion of packaging required to keep seafood cold and fresh in transit can be daunting to eco-conscious consumers. Whether stocking up for a holiday celebration or with an eye to healthier, omega-3-packed eating in the new year, cast your line here.<br />This outfit offers monthly subscription plans with choices of salmon, white fish (such as halibut and cod), or a combination. All seafood is wild-caught sustainably in Alaska, flash frozen and packed in coolers with dry ice. Active members have access to special offerings including Dungeness and snow crab, which come broken down and pre-cooked for easy prep; Alaska’s cold waters make for highly flavorful and subtly sweeter meat. And the sablefish is exceptionally buttery. Monthly plans are easy to set-up thanks to a straightforward website and start at $132 for a 12-pack of 6-ounce portions. wildalaskancompany.com</td>

      <td>Investors shrugging off government’s lawsuits might be missing the bigger picture</td>
      <td>Don’t scroll past  Facebook ’s  latest bit of melodrama.<br />On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission and 46 states sued the social-media company over anticompetitive practices, seeking to force the world’s largest social network to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook arguably has been in lawmakers’ sights since the contentious 2016 presidential election, and the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 certainly didn’t help matters. After years of threats, investors seemed to view the main event as almost anticlimactic, skeptical that such lawsuits will amount to any material change in the near term. Shares of Facebook were down less than 2%, on pace with a selloff affecting big tech peers on Wednesday, with an even more muted drop on Thursday.<br />While all large tech companies face pressure from regulators, Facebook seems to be the easiest target given its structure as three distinct apps. But investors’ doubts about the feasibility of a breakup certainly have merit. Both of Facebook’s acquisitions, for instance, were approved by the FTC itself, and proving that competitors and consumers were harmed, as the suits say, won’t be easy. If anything, the cases will likely take years to resolve.<br />But that doesn’t mean Facebook will skate by in the meantime. The company, which has made its fortune by spending big money to make big money, needs to prove out a fresh strategy to keep growing.<br />Facebook’s advertising business, which still accounted for nearly 99% of its overall revenue in the third quarter, appears to be reaching a saturation point. Ads served on its platform have been increasing by a quarterly average of almost 30% year on year for at least the last five years. Filling its acquired Instagram with them has contributed to that growth, first on the main feed and more recently in the app’s Stories feature. In some cases, users are seeing more ads than the new content they came to the app for. With other social platforms such as Tik Tok, Snapchat and  Pinterest  gaining traction, Facebook already walks a fine line between engaging its users and annoying them.</td>

      <td>There’s no substitute for finding candidates who capture voters’ hearts. No, not even a 30-point plan.</td>
      <td>It is tempting to treat elections as math problems, while ignoring the art required to assemble winning coalitions. Pollsters sort data along demographic groupings, data analysts dissect precinct-level trends, and ad makers consult focus groups to craft appealing messages. The result is policies designed to appeal to enough voters to win, presented by disciplined politicians in sound bites that are repeated relentlessly.<br />To win a primary, policies must appeal to chronic voters with strong single-issue preferences without turning off enough swing voters to lose the general election. Conservatives have to appeal to gun owners and evangelicals to win the primary, but take care not to alienate socially moderate suburban voters in the process. Liberals have to appeal to teacher unions, global-warming activists, pro-choice feminists and minorities to win the primary, but avoid losing fiscally moderate suburban voters in the general. This mechanical, calculating approach to politics is one reason voters discount political promises and the politicians who make them.<br />Donald Trump upended all this. He doesn’t carefully tailor his message or stick to tested and approved sound bites. His more straightforward, undisciplined approach elicits a visceral reaction from voters. Mr. Trump’s supporters are famously loyal, and his opponents suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. Nobody is ambivalent about the president. He has his base’s trust precisely because he isn’t judicious with his words. While they often cringe at his demeanor, they trust him to say what he thinks.<br />Mr. Trump isn’t unique in harnessing his emotional connection with voters to create a durable bond. Policy has always been necessary but insufficient in politics. People vote in large part based on feelings, in addition to policy views. Mr. Trump gives his supporters permission to believe in America and be proudly patriotic. The working-class voters who form his base cheer his opposition to unfair trade deals and liberal immigration policies that they think threaten their jobs, but also adore him for his willingness to fight the elites that look down on them and him. Similarly, there are people who prefer Mr. Trump’s fiscal policies, but voted for Joe Biden because the president made their hearts recoil.<br />Liberals have long contended that conservatives use emotional appeals to manipulate working-class voters into voting against their own economic interests. These appeals, supposedly grounded in patriotic, faith-based or racist rhetoric, are held to fool voters into supporting Republicans who do the bidding of the rich. How else can Democrats explain the millions of multiethnic, working-class voters who refuse to vote for their candidates and won’t support tax increases on the wealthy, redistribution programs and entitlement expansion?</td>

      <td>Unions might resist, but most Democrats now agree that economic isolation is a losing proposition.</td>
      <td>President-elect Joe Biden probably wishes he could avoid trade policy. He can’t. To re-establish partnerships with allies, devise rules for a changing world economy, and prepare the American labor force for the future, Mr. Biden will have to defuse Donald Trump’s trade wars and connect his economic and foreign policies. The press reported on Wednesday that Mr. Biden will nominate Katherine Tai, a talented trade lawyer with experience in Congress, to be U.S. Trade Representative. Ms. Tai has an opportunity to reshape policy and realign trade politics.<br />Since 1947, America’s leadership has included setting the world’s trade agenda. Yet last month, without U.S. participation, 15 other countries in the Asia-Pacific, including China and U.S. allies, signed a new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership to establish rules for the most dynamic 30% of the world economy. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, launched in 2018, drew from provisions in U.S. free-trade agreements. But President Trump dropped out.<br />Countries around the world are negotiating the business standards of the future. The new architects of international economics are adapting to changes in supply chains, including the move to digital platforms and services. The U.S. has instead been preoccupied with raising tariffs. If the U.S. doesn’t show up for modern trade negotiations, it can hardly expect to set the rules.<br />The Biden administration has an opportunity to build a new domestic coalition for trade. In a 2020 survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75% of Democrats agreed that the economic connections of globalization are “mostly good” for the country. A bipartisan 74% said trade is good for the economy and 59% think trade creates jobs at home. Groups ranging from digital denizens to farmers know that economic isolationism is a loser. Even so, Mr. Biden’s political advisers may be inclined to bury the trade topic to avoid fights with labor unions.<br />A new Biden approach should highlight the digital economy, environmental goods and services, and health supplies, as well as intellectual property and agriculture. Accords can advance American values by including terms that boost transparency, fight corruption, and strengthen the rule of law, including for labor rights. The administration should combine its trade agenda with development plans, for example with Africa and Central America, and with carbon and biodiversity goals.</td>

Plenty of new movies have been released for streaming since the Covid-19 pandemic shut down theaters in March. Obviously, though, it hasn’t been the same. There’s a gnawing sense of loss for movie lovers. Of the spectacle that was usually pleasurable, even if the substance wasn’t so great. Of the nourishing ritual—not the popcorn or Milk Duds, though they were swell too, but the social ritual of sitting in the dark and sharing movies with people you did and didn’t know. (This is not the time to dwell on negatives like sticky floors and spectators chattering on their cellphones.)<br />There is also, speaking personally, a sense of fear—that the theatrical experience I’ve thrilled to since childhood may not be long for this world, even after the virus is gone. The outlook grew much darker when Warner Bros. announced that it would release its entire 2021 slate of theatrical films simultaneously in theaters and on its HBO Max streaming service. So much for movie theaters as a sacred domain of motion pictures; that quaint notion was already endangered by other studios shrinking the length of time new movies play in theaters before being released to home video.<br />Will the new Warner Bros. strategy apply only to next year’s films, or will it become the permanent normal? Will competitors follow suit? Whatever happens, the handwriting is on the big screen. Theater chains are already staggering under unprecedented debt loads, and their long-term survival depends in large part on shopping malls whose own prospects are iffy. And many independent theaters may not attempt to reopen, indie films having begun an inexorable transformation into online-only events.<br />As if corporate maneuverings weren’t sufficient reason to worry about the medium’s future, the pandemic has accelerated our national embrace of streaming channels at home. And no wonder, given vast program choices, fees that are reasonable compared with multiplex ticket and concession prices, and hurtling advances in home-theater technology. Watching films on the spacious flat screen in my living room—I’ve just upgraded to 65 from 55 inches—can be a very pleasant experience. It is almost, dare I say it, like going to the movies. There, I’ve said it, so let me remind you of a few films I’ve enjoyed thus far in this strangest of years—not the usual Ten Best, since the holiday release season hasn’t run its full course, but enough good ones to help keep movie love alive.<br />“First Cow” was the first victim of Covid-19 closings. Kelly Reichardt’s poetic vision of frontier life and entrepreneurship circa 1820 opened in four theaters, to ecstatic reviews, on March 6. Nine days later it was pulled from what would have been expanding national theatrical release as the pandemic exploded and movie theaters shut down. Partial justice was done in July, when the film went on streaming platforms for rental or purchase.</td>

      <td>EMMA Grueskin, a 25-year-old project manager for a furniture dealer, recently moved into her first apartment, a Brooklyn walk-up. Decorating indecision plagued her, but she couldn’t afford an interior designer. Then she stumbled on an unexpected source of personalized décor advice: Instagram.<br />As the app has become a thriving marketplace, the account owners behind some design “boutiques” have started serving as personal shoppers and on-demand decorators. They’ll happily scour estate and garage sales for clients in hopes of forming fruitful bonds, as Ms. Grueskin discovered.<br />In the accounts recommended to her by Instagram’s algorithm, she came across a shop called Frost Road House that fellow Brooklynite Gina Reese had launched in June, eager to turn her thrifting hobby into a lockdown side hustle. Ms. Grueskin eyed a photo of tempered glass bottles and trays, then realized it had been sold. She direct messaged Ms. Reese, who offered to create a custom bundle of bottles based on Ms. Grueskin’s specs and a photo of her bedroom. “It’s hard starting from scratch,” Ms. Grueskin admitted. “Having a relationship with someone who I know has good taste and is sourcing quality items is really helpful and cool.”<br />Covid-19 has inspired other Instagrammers to offer similar services. Mirrors of Magic’s Emma Rhoads, who paints custom designs on vintage mirrors, and Lucite Lust’s Jenny Ko, who sells contemporary and vintage homeware, also launched their shops in the past six months. “There’s so much space-shifting with the pandemic. I love helping people figure out who they want to be visually for this new stage in their life,” said Mx.

      <td>The timing of the vaccine rollout could make things awkward for the Federal Reserve</td>
      <td>U.S. inflation readings are almost certainly heading higher next year. The trick will be figuring out whether they are signal or noise.<br />The Labor Department on Thursday reported that consumer prices rose 0.2% in November, putting them 1.2% higher than a year earlier. Prices excluding food and energy items—the so-called core that economists see as a better reflection of inflation’s underlying trend—were up 0.2% on the month and 1.6% on the year.<br />The inflation indexes the Federal Reserve focuses on, from the Commerce Department, run a bit cooler than the Labor Department measures, so for now inflation isn’t within spitting distance of the 2% the central bank is aiming for. That could change soon.<br />A big reason the year-over-year inflation readings are low now is that there was a dip in prices in March through May, when the Covid crisis first struck. Come next March, that shock will start reaching its first anniversary, and the year-over-year comparisons will appear souped-up as a result. If over the next half year prices on a monthly basis rise by just half as much as they did in November, for example, the Labor Department’s headline inflation measure would be up 2.6% on the year by May, with core prices up 2.3%.<br />But the cycling out of last year’s inflation dip won’t be the only thing going on next spring. By then millions of Americans will likely have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, relaxing safety measures just as warm weather returns. The likely result is a surge in demand, particularly in services categories such as travel.</td>

      <td>For the Time Capsule series, we spotlight a cherished restaurant, hotel or landmark that’s changed remarkably little over the years. This week, we visit Great St. Bernard Hospice in Switzerland.<br />Switzerland’s Great St. Bernard Hospice is a bona fide antiquity. A complex of structures perched above the tree line at 8,114 feet—cradled in the aptly named Valley of Desolation—it predates the Swiss-Italian border, just a few yards away. The oldest parts of the structure date to the 11th century, when an Italian vicar, later canonized as St. Bernard of Menthon, built it as a monastery and a refuge for Rome-bound pilgrims crossing the precarious, bandit-riddled transalpine pass. By the 1670s, the monks weren’t just sheltering weary travelers but a breed of jowly pups, descendants of Asiatic hounds. Christened St. Bernards, the dogs were trained to help rescue wayward wanderers and bred at the hospice until 2004. They were hardly the only famous guests. In 1800, Napoleon was nursed back to health in one of the rooms while crossing with 40,000 men and 500 horses. Years later, Charles Dickens, thoroughly chilled by the hospice and its mortuary filled with “the unclaimed,” described Great-St.-Bernard as a “great hollow on the top of a range of dreadful mountains.”<br />A still-active monastery and inn (and part of the Via Francigena pilgrim route running from Canterbury to Rome), the hospice can only be reached by car from June to mid October. In winter, visitors must snowshoe up steep slopes from the shuttered Super St. Bernard Resort, about a two-hour drive from Geneva or Turin. The 90-minute climb is arduous, but the backcountry ski back down is rewarding. Ditto for the hospice’s hospitality. The exteriors might retain their colorless austerity, but they harbor an interior with crackling fires; carved wood ceilings; long, unexpectedly convivial lunches; and generously refilled wine carafes. While a fancy 30-room auberge opened within the hospice a few years back, it only operates in summer and early fall. Otherwise, standard dorms and a few private rooms make for a spare stay. Winter guests must bring their own sleeping bag, or purchase one there. Now, under the Covid-19 regulations, masks are mandatory too, but even that isn’t new: This isn’t the hospice’s first pandemic.<br />A brief history of St. Bernard dogs<br />1670s The monks at Great St. Bernard Hospice begin breeding Swiss alpine dogs.</td>

      <td>How can investors who missed out on  Tesla Inc.  sleep at night? The electric-car company is up 12,551% since the close on the day of its 2010 IPO, enough to turn a modest $10,000 holding into a $1.3 million luxury beach house. It was possible to make the same return by buying the broad market—but only if you invested in 1973. This was the deal of a lifetime; regret, thy name is Elon.<br />If you missed it, you’re in good company. Tesla has only recently stopped being the most-shorted major stock, and only because those betting against it lost too much money. I missed Tesla too, initially seeing it as only a niche sports-car stock and later scoffing at Elon Musk’s grand ambition. And while obviously I’d like an extra $1 million as much as the next guy, I’m not distressed that I missed out.<br />Investors can’t afford regret. Every day brings new opportunities to become very rich, most of which we are bound to miss. Tesla’s 125-fold increase isn’t even the best gain since it listed. That honor, at least among the top 3,000 stocks in the U.S., goes to  Xpel Inc.,  which makes film to protect car paintwork. It was a penny stock with a market value of a bit more than half a million dollars when Tesla came to market, and has since soared almost 170,000%, leaving Tesla in the dust.<br />None of us who missed Xpel are kicking ourselves. Penny stocks—even those on reputable markets like the Nasdaq, as Xpel is—don’t usually do anything special. They are difficult and costly to trade, hard to find information on and often deeply troubled. Many vanish without a trace.<br />There is plenty of scope for disappointment among larger stocks, too. There are nine companies trading today that have lost more than 99% of their value since June 2010. Plenty of others fell to zero.</td>

Europe has been hit much harder than the U.S. and other advanced economies as strict lockdowns have repeatedly closed businesses and hurt the south’s large tourism industry.<br />Together with a new €750 billion joint fund that European Union leaders are expected to finalize this week, the decision underscores Europe’s willingness to combat this year’s economic downturn using new debt. That marks a shift in strategy from the region’s debt crisis a decade ago, when many governments sought to quickly tighten their purse strings.<br />Markets were muted following the ECB’s decision, though yields on Italian government debt, the riskiest among the area’s major economies, hovered near multiyear lows, indicating that investors were comfortable with the bank’s efforts to keep the financial system flush with cash.<br />They will now turn to ECB President Christine Lagarde’s news conference, starting at 8:30 a.m. ET, where she will explain the reasoning behind the decision and unveil fresh forecasts for economic growth and inflation.</td>

The catalog will also no longer be published online.<br />Like an international version of the  Sears  catalog, which ceased publication in 1993, the IKEA book sold not only housewares, but a lifestyle.

It occupied a cultural spot in brand marketing. It was special.”<br />As web shopping surged over the past two decades, IKEA said fewer and fewer people were using its catalog.

That matches with other measures showing the economy is recovering, but at a slower pace in recent months.<br />Jobless claims data has been viewed as a bellwether for economists and policy makers for a half-century. However, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, last month said jobless claims have contained inconsistent data because of the pandemic-related surge in applications and attempted fraud.

      <td>With excise-tax cuts set to lapse after Dec. 31, beer makers warn of damage to business</td>
      <td>Brad Hittle, chief executive of Two Roads Brewing Co. in Stratford, Conn., has had a brutal roller coaster of a year, and now he is facing a tax increase if Congress doesn’t act soon.<br />Business at the craft brewery off Interstate 95 plummeted in March as the coronavirus spread. Mr. Hittle furloughed his sales staff and cut pay, then benefited from a Paycheck Protection Program loan and a summer outdoor-dining boomlet before cold weather lowered demand again.<br />“I feel like I’m in a boxing ring. And after Round 1 I was bloodied, and Round 2 I fought back,” he said. “Round 3: I’m getting bloodied again.”<br />The punches are a combination of the resurging pandemic, new dining restrictions and the excise-tax increase that is slated for January.<br />Two Roads is among brewers, wineries and distilleries across the country pressing Congress to continue excise-tax cuts that were created in the 2017 tax law, extended last year and now are set to lapse Dec. 31.</td>

      <td>Gilead Sciences Inc.  said Thursday it will acquire Germany’s MYR GmbH and its new hepatitis drug for about $1.4 billion, reported as 1.15 billion euros, in the company’s latest deal to jump-start revenue growth.<br />The all-cash deal, expected to close in the first quarter, will expand Gilead’s offerings of hepatitis treatments.<br />MYR, a 35-person company based in Bad Homburg, received conditional approval from European regulators in July to market its drug Hepcludex for treatment of hepatitis D, a viral disease that can lead to liver cirrhosis, cancer and death.<br />The disease affects at least 12 million people globally and about 230,000 in the U.S. and Europe, Gilead said. MYR is currently selling the drug in France, Germany and Austria and plans to launch in more countries next year, Gilead said. The company intends to seek U.S. approval in the second half of 2021.<br />Under the terms of the deal, Gilead will pay MYR shareholders up to $362 million, reported as 300 million euros, in additional milestone payments upon a U.S. approval, Gilead said.</td>

      <td>Jersey City officials say they have trained police and engaged communities to guard against future incidents of domestic terrorism after a mass shooting targeted the city’s Jewish community one year ago.<br />Two shooters went on an hourslong rampage in the city’s Greenville section on Dec. 10, 2019, besieging a kosher grocery store and getting into firefights with police that killed four people, including a police officer, and the two perpetrators.<br />The assailants, David Anderson and Francine Graham, used high-powered rifles in their attack and had originally intended to strike a Jewish day school near the grocery, officials said. A van driven by Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham was found to contain an undetonated pipe bomb. Officials said the two had planned the attack for months while traveling and living in Bayonne, N.J., and Ohio, and had a history of making statements against police and Jewish people.<br />Mayor Steven Fulop, who is Jewish, said in an interview that the incident left deep wounds across the city, traumatizing Jewish residents, members of law enforcement and members of the city’s Black community.<br />In the months since the attack, city officials have worked to counter anti-Semitism and strengthen tactical preparedness, Mr. Fulop said, by holding meetings with community leaders and residents, and implementing training for officers.</td>

      <td>Financial troubles at a WeWork-like Chinese apartment provider are causing problems for hundreds of thousands of renters, forcing local governments in China and a bank backed by  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  to step in.<br />Before the coronavirus pandemic, Danke Apartment, the main business of New York-listed  Phoenix Tree Holdings Ltd. , rode a boom in the country’s housing and rental market and expanded rapidly using a business model similar to that of the U.S. office-space startup.<br />Danke, known as an apartment operator, signed multiyear leases with many landlords in major Chinese cities and subleased spaces to renters, often after partitioning, decorating and furnishing units. The nearly six-year-old company billed itself as a technology provider and used an online platform to transact with property owners and tenants. It went public in the U.S. in January this year.<br />Danke also relied heavily on an unusual financing model. Most tenants of the more than 419,000 apartments it manages took out rental loans from online lenders. The lump sums these individuals borrowed—typically for a year’s rent—went to Danke, which paid some of it to landlords monthly or quarterly, and used the rest to help fund apartment renovations, maintenance services and its operations. Renters paid down the loans in monthly installments to lenders.<br />At the end of 2019, Danke had the equivalent of $420 million in short-term liabilities from “rent financing,” making up a little more than half its total borrowings.</td>

      <td>An annual China-Europe trade forum was quietly canceled last month after European organizers rejected Chinese demands to ban participants critical of Beijing.<br />The move, not previously reported, highlights an increasingly difficult balance Europe is trying to strike between safeguarding business interests and upholding democratic values in the face of China’s increasingly aggressive global stance. The U.S. and Australia have taken more forceful stands against pressure from China, sparking public fights and trade battles.<br />The annual China-EU CEO and Former Senior Officials Dialogue—a closed-door event that includes around 40 chief executives, top officials and academics from Europe and China—would have been its fourth edition and taken place this year by videoconference.<br />In previous years, participant lists weren’t controversial, organizers say. But this year, European organizers at BusinessEurope, an umbrella organization for the European Union’s national business lobbies, rejected Chinese demands to exclude certain participants.<br />The event’s cancellation offers a fresh sign of Europe’s hardening stance toward Beijing, a shift that became evident last year when the bloc described China as a systemic rival, and was underscored during the coronavirus pandemic with senior EU officials blaming China for disinformation. But the reluctance on both sides to escalate this conflict and the organizers’ insistence that another dialogue should take place again next year highlight the conflicting forces at play.</td>

      <td>ST. PETERSBURG—In August, President Vladimir Putin heralded the approval of a Russian vaccine against Covid-19. Officials promised to produce millions of doses by year’s end.<br />Now, however, those ambitions have been greatly reduced—St. Petersburg, home to five million people, is due to get just 5,000 doses this month—as the country struggles to manufacture the two-shot vaccine, Sputnik V, in large quantities. Russia expects to produce just two million doses by the end of the year, down from the 30 million promised over the summer.<br />“We were all excited when 30 million doses were promised,” said Dmitry Kulish, professor at Moscow-based private research institute Skoltech, which focuses on pharmaceutical innovation. “But that was a hyper-optimistic forecast. We are more realistic now.”<br />To help ramp up production, Russian authorities have turned to a clutch of companies including BIOCAD, a private-sector pharmaceutical company that hasn’t been involved in vaccine work before. Hundreds of its scientists and technicians are now racing to find ways to transform small amounts of the vaccine into tens of millions of doses.<br />“Scaling is a complex process,” said Dmitry Morozov, BIOCAD’s chief executive. “What was effective in the lab may not be replicated in large volumes.”</td>

Big cities visited by tourists had been Airbnb’s strength, but it redesigned its app and website to focus on local stays as people flocked to destinations within driving distance.<br />In August, more than half of bookings made were for stays within 300 miles of the guest’s location, according to the company.<br />As Airbnb blossomed into a global behemoth, it spent big. Costs jumped five-fold between 2015 and 2019. The pandemic forced the company to shed a quarter of staff, remove noncore businesses and drastically cut sales and marketing, a big expense.</td>

He said the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in police custody in May and the ensuing protests prompted corporate leaders to re-examine their initiatives and join forces.</td>

      <td>PARIS—France’s privacy watchdog issued more than $163 million in fines to  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and  Amazon.com Inc.,  saying they improperly collected information about website visitors, taking a hard line as European regulators haggle over such sanctions.<br />The French regulator, the CNIL, said Thursday that it fined Google €100 million, equivalent to $120.8 million—a record for a privacy fine in France—for allegedly storing advertising-related identifiers on millions of users’ computers before asking for individuals’ consent, and without explaining sufficiently how the identifiers, called cookies, were used. It fined Amazon €35 million for the same violations.<br />Since the CNIL informed Google and Amazon of its investigations earlier this year, each company has updated its website in Europe to stop placing advertising cookies before asking for consent, the CNIL said Thursday. But the regulator added that the companies still don’t properly explain how the cookies are used, and ordered both companies to better inform users within three month—or face further fines of €100,000 a day.<br />Google stands by its privacy efforts in Europe, a company spokesman said, and is considering whether to appeal the CNIL decision. The decision “overlooks these efforts and doesn’t account for the fact that French rules and regulatory guidance are uncertain and constantly evolving,” he said.<br />An Amazon spokesman said the company disagrees with the decision, and complies with privacy laws. “We continuously update our privacy practices to ensure that we meet the evolving needs and expectations of customers and regulators,” he said. He didn’t reply when asked if the company plans to appeal.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—China is revoking visa exemptions for U.S. diplomatic passport holders in Hong Kong and Macau and said it would impose other unspecified sanctions to retaliate for actions the Trump administration took against Chinese officials this week.<br />The sanctions would affect U.S. officials and nonprofit personnel who had “expressed vile positions on the Hong Kong question” along with their immediate family members, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Thursday at a regular press briefing in Beijing.<br />The moves were undertaken because the U.S. had “exploited Hong Kong-related issues to seriously interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s core interests,” Ms. Hua said. She didn’t say when the sanctions would take effect.<br />Beijing’s announcement comes after the White House placed 14 senior Chinese officials on its sanctions blacklist on Monday. The Trump administration said the officials had been responsible for eroding Hong Kong’s political autonomy.<br />Asked for comment on the Chinese sanctions, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing referred to a statement published on their website earlier on Thursday, expressing “the United States’ deep concerns over Beijing’s ongoing assault against the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people guaranteed to them in the Sino-U.K. Joint Declaration.”</td>
