      <td>BRUSSELS—A powerful European business lobby group called on European Union politicians to push back harder against China’s state capitalism but not to lock out Chinese businesses, as advocated by some leaders who are following the U.S.’s lead on limiting commercial ties to China.<br />Members of the European Round Table for Industry, or ERT, a trade group of almost 60 chief executives and chairpersons of major Europe-based multinationals, on Monday called on EU leaders to push for better business terms with China and not to turn away, despite some leaders’ growing misgivings about Beijing and amid improving ties with Washington.<br />Many governments and EU officials have over recent months tilted more toward Washington in opposing Beijing’s increasingly assertive stance on the world stage. The business leaders fear calls for decoupling from China, similar to ones in the U.S.<br />“We have to make this work,” ERT member Jacob Wallenberg said of commercial relations between China and the West. Mr. Wallenberg, who is chairman of Swedish holding company Investor AB and deputy chairman of telecommunications giant  Ericsson  AB, said China has begun opening its banking, insurance and other sectors under EU and U.S. pressure, and such pressure could improve the West’s business position with China.<br />“Is it perfect? No—far from it,” Mr. Wallenberg said. But he said improvements are “a consequence of continuous pushing, and I think we have reason to continue to push.”</td>

It said the review is aimed at preventing national data security risks, maintaining national security and protecting public interests.<br />Shares in  SoftBank Group Corp. , which owns stakes in both Didi Global and Full Truck Alliance, fell 4.9% in Monday morning trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.<br />(more to come)</td>

More than 50% of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, and Covid-19 cases have plummeted from the winter highs.<br />Businesses are reopening and the economy is recovering. The weekend is expected to be a busy one for travel, with Americans hitting the road after a year of lockdowns.<br />But vaccinations have slowed in recent months, and the White House recently acknowledged that the U.S. wouldn’t reach the president’s goal of getting at least one coronavirus vaccine dose to 70% of the adult population by July 4. The highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus is spreading rapidly. And a recent surge in the inflation rate has some economists worried about the economy overheating.<br />“It’s a holiday weekend. I’m going to celebrate it. There’s great things happening,” Mr. Biden said at a White House event Friday. “All across America people are going to ballgames and doing good things.”</td>

The USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service said that the chicken may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes and classified the recall as high risk.<br />The USDA has posted a list with labels of the chicken products included in the recall.<br />The USDA said the recall came after the agency was notified June 9 of two people sick with listeriosis. An agency investigation identified three listeriosis illnesses, including one death, between April 6 and June 5, the agency said. Two chicken samples collected during the investigation were found to contain bacteria closely related to the strains involved in those illnesses, the USDA said, and one of those chicken samples was collected at Tyson Foods.<br />Tyson said the recalled products were produced at its Dexter, Mo., plant between late December and mid-April, and were sold to restaurants and supermarkets across the U.S. and Puerto Rico.</td>

Gannett operates more than 250 newspapers, including USA Today.<br />The push comes after e-commerce surged and ad spending declined for a time during the Covid-19 pandemic, increasing pressure on media organizations to hunt for new revenue streams and to shore up their digital businesses.<br />“Top-line revenue has grown 50% every year for the last three years, and our projections for 2021 are around the same percentage,” said Chris Lloyd, general manager of Reviewed. He declined to provide dollar revenues.<br />Mr. Lloyd said the site’s staff has increased to 80 full-time employees. Most new hires are editors and writers who work at the company’s 25,000-square-foot testing lab in Cambridge, Mass. Reviews are published online at Reviewed.com and across the USA Today Network, meaning any of Gannett’s newspapers can run articles written by Reviewed staffers.</td>

      <td>In iBuying, just because you bet on technology, it doesn’t mean you’re a winner</td>
      <td>Everyone wants to be a tech company. Office-sharing, meat substitution, ride-hailing, fashion styling, fitness—they are all technology businesses, according to founders who covet the highflying valuations the appellation can garner in the public markets.<br />But just having technology doesn’t automatically make an investment superior. Consider real estate’s digital home flipping: Here is a business that is undoubtedly “tech” but where the value of the technology isn’t yet clear. With iBuyer Offerpad’s merger with blank-check firm Supernova Partners expected to close early this quarter, the value of technology—or lack thereof—is something that online real-estate investors will want to consider as they place their bets in a crowded field.<br />So-called “pure play” iBuyers Offerpad and competitor  Opendoor Technologies  both describe themselves as technology companies. Opendoor says it is a “digital platform for residential real estate.” Offerpad says it is focused on “tech-enabled real estate solutions.” Both companies have a chief technology officer and some version of a data scientist, presumably there to hone the technology investments and analyze their utility.<br />These companies may be solving similar pain points in seamlessly digitizing real-estate transactions, but they seem to be approaching the problem in different ways—Opendoor with money and Offerpad with experience. As of its March presentation, Offerpad said it had raised less than 9% of what SoftBank-fueled Opendoor had, though it had bought and subsequently sold 38% as many homes. And whereas Offerpad is led by a former real-estate agent, Opendoor is led by someone from the real estate technology business.<br />Opendoor’s deep pockets have no doubt fueled its rapid growth. It is now active in 39 markets with the stated goal of entering 42 by year-end—double the number of markets Offerpad is targeting this year, despite being only one year younger. But bigger doesn’t necessarily mean better: Opendoor lost far more money last year.</td>

      <td>The Three Lions have yet to concede a goal at Euro 2020 on their way to the semifinals, where they join Denmark, Italy, and Spain.</td>
      <td>LONDON—In the stressful months that preceded Euro 2020, as England manager Gareth Southgate contemplated his squad for the tournament, he had no idea what his strongest lineup might be this summer.<br />Southgate was staring at England’s most gifted crop of attacking players in a generation. There was potential to light up this European Championship with offense. England, for once, might even be fun to watch.<br />That’s when Southgate, one of the coolest heads in international soccer, decided to run in the other direction. If England was going to make its first final in 45 years, Southgate knew he would have to fix the back line first. He took an often ropey goalkeeper, a central defender prone to spectacular errors, a fullback once cast aside by Jose Mourinho, and a monolith nicknamed Slabhead and turned them into the best defense in the European game.<br />Through five games at this tournament, including Saturday night’s 4-0 drubbing of Ukraine in the quarterfinals, England has yet to concede a single goal. England will play Denmark in the semifinals on Wednesday in London, a day after Italy and Spain face off in the other semi.<br />“That’s what we’re building on,” captain Harry Kane said after his side punched its ticket to Wednesday’s semifinal against Denmark. “It’s the final part of winning games and winning tournaments.”</td>

A wide body of research focused on the effects of highway spending suggests that major new investment in U.S. roads would generate little, if any, long-term economic gain.<br />While the projects would spur hiring and spending temporarily, both when they are announced and under way, they aren’t likely to raise the economy’s productivity and, in turn, its overall growth potential in a lasting way, many researchers find.<br />That is because the U.S. already has an extensive system of roads, so building more wouldn’t add much to productivity, economists say.<br />“Highways can generate a boost for the short run, but in the long run that seems to be dubious,” said Gilles Duranton, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania.</td>

      <td>It doesn’t really matter how inconvenient it is to pay in bitcoin when you don’t have any other choice</td>
      <td>Ransomware is to bitcoin as the Internal Revenue Service is to the dollar. Just as the taxman forces you to use dollars to pay your taxes, electronic ransom demands have been set in bitcoin, forcing companies, individuals and even some governments to use the cryptocurrency if they wish to regain control of their computer systems.<br />If this sounds wacky, bear with me. Before getting into the full explanation, we need a brief tour of theories of money. The most widely accepted is that money was created because early humans found it so inconvenient to barter with pigs, llamas or berries. It would be much easier to swap my llamas for widely accepted items—cowrie shells, fancy feather boas or carved stones—and then swap those items again for grain than it would be to find someone with grain who happened to want llamas.<br />Money was also a means of accounting for debts; easier still than using cowrie shells would be to take the grain now, get some notches on a tally stick, and later provide llamas, or grain, or whatever was promised to pay off the debt.<br />The first of these theories focuses on money as a means of exchange, an area where bitcoin has floundered because of the cost and hassle required to actually buy something in bitcoin. Only when its anonymity and international nature help enough to offset these disadvantages, such as in evading money-laundering laws, taxes and capital controls, is it much used. The rest of bitcoin trading is speculation and exchange arbitrage.<br />The second theory focuses on money’s role as a unit of account, an area where bitcoin hasn’t had any success so far. Even in El Salvador, where bitcoin is being made legal tender, stuff will still be priced first in dollars, then translated into bitcoin for anyone paying in crypto.</td>

But beyond that, ETFs are just mutual funds with a few extra features.<br />So, what’s the big deal? Here are answers to common questions about the two types of fund investments.<br />• What are these funds to begin with?<br />Mutual funds and ETFs are both baskets of stocks, bonds or other securities that allow individual investors to participate in the market without being at the mercy of a single security. There could be a few dozen stocks in a particular fund, or thousands. Some funds merely try to match the market, so you’ll be riding along with Wall Street’s overall gains or losses, while others target specific sectors (like tech stocks), which could zoom or drop apart from the overall market. Some funds are even highly leveraged (you’ll see 2x or 3x in their names), which ramps up the risk.</td>

      <td>A fading pandemic and heating U.S. economy appear to be paying off for lower-wage workers.<br />New jobs at restaurants, hotels, stores, salons and similar in-person roles accounted for about half of all payroll gains in June, according to the Labor Department. And workers in those industries are seeing larger raises than other employees.<br />“Americans are becoming more mobile and dining out more,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. “Retailers and restaurants are having to pay more to hire workers to meet that demand.”<br />Restaurants and other hospitality businesses added a seasonally adjusted 343,000 jobs in June, the department said Friday. Retailers added 67,000 jobs last month, including strong gains at clothing stores, indicating Americans are getting dressed up to go out and back to offices. Similarly, personal-services businesses such as salons and dry cleaners added 29,000 jobs. Overall, employers added in 850,000 jobs last month, the best monthly gain since August 2020.<br />In the first six months of the year, the leisure and hospitality sector alone has accounted for nearly 50% of the 3.3 million jobs added in the U.S.</td>

      <td>SÃO PAULO—Brazil’s Supreme Court authorized prosecutors to investigate President Jair Bolsonaro over accusations he ignored alleged irregularities in his government’s procurement process to buy India’s Covaxin Covid-19 vaccine.<br />The investigation comes as the former army captain, who is planning to run for re-election next year, already faces criticism from public health experts for his handling of Covid-19, which has killed more than a half a million Brazilians.<br />However, political scientists said Mr. Bolsonaro still holds enough support in Congress to quash any legal proceedings against him. In Brazil, criminal charges against a president that would emanate from an investigation can only proceed with the backing of two-thirds of the lower house of Congress.<br />The probe centers on whether Mr. Bolsonaro ignored potential wrongdoing by senior members of the Health Ministry, who are alleged to have pushed ahead with a vaccine deal that others in the ministry had raised concerns about.<br />In testimony during a televised congressional inquiry last week into the country’s Covid-19 crisis, Luis Miranda, a Health Ministry official and whistleblower, said he faced “abnormal pressure” from members of the ministry to allow the importation of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine despite irregularities in the procurement process.</td>

      <td>The ransomware group that collected an $11 million payment from meat producer JBS SA about a month ago has begun a widespread attack that could affect hundreds of organizations world-wide, according to cybersecurity experts.<br />The group, known as REvil, has focused its attack on Kaseya VSA, software used by large companies and technology-service providers to manage and distribute software updates to systems on computer networks, according to security researchers and VSA’s maker, Kaseya Ltd.<br />The use of trusted partners like software makers or service providers to identify and compromise new victims, often called a supply-chain attack, is unusual in cases of ransomware, in which hackers shut down the systems of institutions and demand payment to allow them to regain control. The Kaseya incident appears to be the “largest and most significant” such attack to date, said Brett Callow, a threat analyst for cybersecurity company Emsisoft.<br />Upon learning of the attack Friday, Kaseya immediately shut down its servers and began warning customers, the company said. As of Friday evening only customers running the software on their own servers, rather than users of Kaseya’s online service, appear to have been affected, the company said.<br />The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency advised Kaseya users to shut down their VSA servers immediately. “CISA is closely monitoring this situation and we are working with the FBI to gather information about its impact,” said Eric Goldstein, the agency’s executive assistant director for cybersecurity, in a statement.</td>

      <td>Americans light up the sky to celebrate independence from Britain. But colorful combustibles, like their name, hail from the old world.</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />If there’s one word that Americans associate with Fourth of July festivities, it’s “fireworks”—a term that has been used continually since the country’s earliest Independence Day celebrations.<br />In 1777, the year after the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia marked the anniversary with “a grand exhibition of fireworks, which began and concluded with thirteen rockets on the commons, and the city was beautifully illuminated,” according to one dispatch.<br />The fireworks celebrated independence from Great Britain, but both the colorful combustibles and the common name for them were direct imports from the new nation’s erstwhile colonizers. Fireworks themselves were first developed in China, the home of gunpowder. But the word for them entered English in the early 16th century, likely influenced by comparable words in Dutch (“vuurwerk”) and German (“Feuerwerk”).<br />Originally, all of these terms referred to the military use of explosive devices, particularly gunpowder charges. During the reign of Henry VIII, English forces held control over Calais in northern France, and a document dated to 1528 specified the components of “fyre worke” that would be needed to defend the city from assault by French troops.</td>

      <td>In John Trumbull’s historic picture ‘Declaration of Indpendence,’ the philosophical Thomas Jefferson and the pious John Adams represent two poles of the American creed.</td>
      <td>The most famous image of America’s founding, John Trumbull’s painting “Declaration of Independence,” does not depict the events of July 4, 1776. Rather, it portrays a scene that took place on June 28, when Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Livingston and Roger Sherman presented the Declaration to the Continental Congress. Trumbull, who began his career as an artist after serving as an aide-de-camp to George Washington in the Continental Army, made his first small painting of this scene in the 1790s. In 1818 he completed a larger version, which several years later was placed in the Capitol, where it still hangs today.<br />John Adams, one of the few surviving founders, was wary of the project. The story of the Revolution, he wrote to Trumbull, was a complex layering of events and individuals. To reduce it to a single scene was dishonest: “Let not our Posterity be deluded by fictions under pretense of poetical or graphical Licenses.”<br />Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, embraced Trumbull’s use of artistic license; without it, he wrote, “the talent of imagination would be banished from the art.” In fact, as the art historian Paul Stiati has written, the original painting had been Jefferson’s suggestion, which helps to explain why Trumbull made the author of the Declaration stand out, resplendent in a red vest and grasping the document in his hands. At first glance, “Declaration of Independence” seems to celebrate Jefferson as the author of America itself.<br />But as the historian David McCullough has pointed out, while Jefferson is prominent, it is Adams, the chief advocate of independence in the Continental Congress, who occupies the center of the canvas. Every other founder’s physique is partially obscured, while Adams can be seen in his entirety. Most great paintings give us one focal point, but this one has two.<br />This is appropriate, because Adams and Jefferson can be seen as the two intellectual poles of the Revolution. Jefferson was an ardent admirer of the Enlightenment and believed that the American founding would “show by example the sufficiency of human reason for the care of human affairs.” Adams also appreciated the power of reason, but like Edmund Burke across the Atlantic, he emphasized the importance of religious and moral tradition in preserving society.</td>

      <td>A push to split up Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google may mean more competition and innovation. But it may also curb conveniences we’ve come to take for granted.</td>
      <td>As momentum builds to curtail the power of Big Tech, lawmakers, Beltway pundits and the companies themselves are all competing to explain to the public what it might mean to us, the everyday consumers of goods and services from those in the crosshairs.<br />Will my iPhone really become less secure, as Apple has claimed? Would the selection we’ve grown accustomed to on  Amazon  shrink, as the company has intimated? Would  Facebook  being forced to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp break those services, as Facebook would have us believe? And would the quality of Google search be degraded by its inability to feature its own services, such as Google Maps and YouTube videos, in results? Or, as the companies’ critics would have it, will life be better for users, competitors and society if all those things come to pass?<br />Those questions gained new significance last month when the House Judiciary Committee, with bipartisan support, approved a half dozen bills that signaled fresh willingness to break up the Faaam, as I like to call the tech-titan quintet. ( Microsoft ,  so far, has largely avoided the crosshairs.)<br />Given the torturous process of federal lawmaking, the chances of these bills becoming law in their present form aren’t high, and any movement could be slow. Congress is preoccupied with other battles at the moment. The companies, their lobbyists, and allies are already pushing back forcefully against this legislation, and against the new head of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, who has criticized tech giants. A federal judge’s decision this past week dismissing antitrust lawsuits against Facebook for being “legally insufficient” suggests that implementing stricter rules won’t be easy.<br />But the chances are clearly rising that something like the provisions in these bills could become the rules by which Big Tech must abide—through an act of Congress, laws at the state level, court battles, a new crop of regulators like Ms. Khan or bipartisan political will to move against tech.</td>

India approved it for emergency use earlier this year. It is one of the two main Covid-19 vaccines that India has been administering to its citizens, the other being the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca PLC and manufactured in India by the Serum Institute of India.<br />Some in India had questioned the safety and effectiveness of the Bharat Biotech vaccine because of its approval in India before the late-stage trial results. Some healthcare workers said at the time that the quick approval had made some people hesitant to take the vaccine, contributing to a slower rollout of the country’s vaccination drive.<br />As of Saturday, India had administered more than 344 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines—more total doses than any other country—but only 4.3% of its population has been fully vaccinated. By comparison, the U.S. has vaccinated about 47% of its population, the U.K. 48% and Canada 33%, according to data compiled by the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data project.</td>

Average rents are $1,000 a month for a two-bedroom unit and $900 for a one-bedroom unit, Mr. Morali said.

The Vatican was seeking the extradition of a middleman, Gianluigi Torzi, accused of extortion, embezzlement, fraud and money laundering.<br />In September of last year, Cardinal Becciu renounced his Vatican post and the rights of a cardinal, though not his title, at the request of Pope Francis.

Justice Barrett likewise didn’t join calls by other conservatives to take up some potentially divisive hot-button cases, including several aiming to limit LGBT rights.<br />“She came away as a careful member of the court who is not going to be throwing bombs or making sweeping pronouncements, but judging cases on an individual basis,” said University of Iowa law professor Derek Muller, who studied under Justice Barrett when she taught at Notre Dame Law School. Some Republicans, he said, were disappointed that several of her cases didn’t reach outcomes more in line with their political priorities.</td>

      <td>After two years of relative quiet, a little town of less than 1,500 people at the edge of Idaho’s Sawtooth National Forest is resuming its role as a corporate pilgrimage site where the future of media is weighed.<br />Jets crowding the airspace over Sun Valley this weekend belong to the business leaders attending investment bank Allen & Co.’s annual conference, reconvening at a resort lodge after the pandemic halted last year’s gathering and changed consumer behavior in ways that add pressure on streaming providers.<br />With a highly transmissible coronavirus variant spreading through the U.S., strict protocols will be in place for the five-day event that starts Tuesday, from required vaccinations to proof of a negative Covid-19 test. The conference is typically both fertile ground for deal making and a family affair complete with hay rides for children, but it will be limited to adults this year, according to people familiar with the matter. Some of the sessions will be held outdoors to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, the people said.<br />An executive for Allen & Co. who is helping organize the conference didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />As the U.S. economy has steadily rebounded, media companies have intensified their efforts to compete in video streaming. Consumers continue to shift toward streaming services such as  Netflix Inc.  and  Walt Disney Co. ’s Hulu and cut the cord from traditional pay-TV subscriptions, a trend that accelerated during pandemic-related lockdowns over the past year.</td>

      <td>While conservative justices generally prevailed, they were divided over how much and how fast to change interpretations of the law</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court’s term, conducted in the unprecedented disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic, included notes of consensus among the nine justices after the conservative majority expanded in October.<br />But the term, which ended this week, also saw the newly expanded conservative majority prevailing in several major decisions, favoring state sovereignty over claims of discrimination against minority voters, the anonymity of nonprofit donors over government auditors and corporate defendants over class-action plaintiffs, among others.<br />The conservative wing divided, however, over how much and how fast to change interpretations of the law, with Chief Justice John Roberts, often followed by the two newest justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, at times putting the brakes on their colleagues Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.<br />“I think it’s still the Roberts Court,” said Vikram Amar, dean of the University of Illinois College of Law. The triumvirate led by the chief justice often appears to decide “how much law is made and in what direction it’s going,” Mr. Amar said.<br />That was evident Friday, when over the objection of some more-conservative justices the court declined to revisit landmark precedents including  New York Times Co.  v. Sullivan, a 1964 decision affording wide protection to the news media; and Kelo v. New London, a 2005 ruling granting authorities broad discretion to condemn private property for public purposes when just compensation is paid.</td>

So it is a big deal for everybody.”<br />Game makers are jockeying to expand their user bases by reaching billions of people on the device they tend to use most, a smartphone, according to company executives and analysts. The moves come as industry revenue from mobile games is projected to continue rising in 2021, while revenue from PC and console games—which boomed during the pandemic as people were stuck at home—is projected to decline.<br />U.S. companies this year have already spent more on mergers and acquisitions for mobile-gaming studios than in all of 2020, according to research firm PitchBook Data Inc. There is a “race for scale” going on in mobile to acquire the largest user bases, said Doug Creutz, an analyst at investment bank  Cowen Inc.,  and more users mean more revenue.</td>

      <td>Congress, White House so far appear unwilling to take sweeping actions to cancel student debt</td>
      <td>The Biden administration is considering extending a pandemic freeze on Americans’ student-loan payments beyond its scheduled expiration in September and turning to piecemeal measures to lower their student-debt bills.<br />Five months into his term, President Biden has resisted calls from fellow Democrats and activists to cancel most of America’s $1.6 trillion in federal student-loan debt in one swoop through an executive action. Congress also appears unlikely to make it happen because Democrats lack the Republican support they would need to pass such a measure.<br />Yet many Americans effectively are seeing their debt bills reduced through policy changes that started under the Trump administration, which froze student-loan payments when the pandemic began unfolding in March 2020. The move, which the Biden administration extended through September, has in effect forgiven tens of billions of dollars in student debt that families otherwise would have paid, mostly by waiving interest charges.<br />Mr. Biden’s education secretary, Miguel Cardona, told a congressional panel last month that the administration is considering extending the payment freeze beyond September. Asked for comment on that possibility, an administration official said Mr. Biden “continues to look into what debt-relief actions can be taken administratively.” The official restated Mr. Biden’s desire for Congress to pass a law to forgive $10,000 in student debt for every federal borrower. Administration lawyers are studying whether the president has the authority to cancel debt through executive action, the official said.<br />Last month, the Education Department canceled $500 million in student debt owed by thousands of former students of the defunct ITT Technical Institute, which federal regulators have accused of financial mismanagement and deceptive recruiting tactics. The department has said it would move later this year to tweak federal rules to allow more aggrieved borrowers who attended other for-profit schools to have their debt forgiven.</td>

      <td>The GOP state Senate debunks fraud claims, and it’s worth a read.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump says fraud is the only reason he lost the 2020 election. Some even think Mr. Trump will be reinstated once the truth comes out. Anyone who finds this narrative at all appealing should take 30 minutes to read the investigative report posted last week by Michigan Republicans. It’s only 35 pages.<br />The report is from the GOP state Senate’s Oversight Committee, which synthesized testimony from about 90 people, plus thousands of pages of subpoenaed documents. The committee’s chair, Ed McBroom, was a Trump delegate at the 2016 GOP national convention, and in 2019 he was a guest at the White House, looking on while Mr. Trump signed an executive order.<br />While the report identifies “clear weaknesses in our elections system that require legislative remedy,” it is unsparing about misinformation and innuendo. As Democrats regained power after the 2016 election, Mr. McBroom writes, “they were quick to utilize all of it to spend two years chasing every conspiracy and specious allegation.” He adds: “I pray my own party will not repeat this mistake for the next four years.”<br />The committee investigated 200 alleged dead voters. Only two problems were found. One was “a clerical error” involving a father and son with the same name. The other was an absentee ballot submitted by a 92-year-old, who then died four days before the election. That bad ballot should not have slipped through, though the report says 3,500 similar votes were caught.<br />Detroit’s counting center received deliveries of ballots at 3:30 a.m. and 4:30 a.m., but the inquiry found no evidence of fraud. A purportedly suspicious picture “was a photo of a WXYZ-TV photographer hauling his equipment.” Also, look at the numbers: Voter turnout in Wayne County (Detroit) was up only 11.4% last year, compared with 15.4% in the rest of Michigan, which hardly sounds like a dump of fake ballots. President Trump received a higher share of Wayne County’s vote in 2020 than in 2016.</td>

      <td>Teachers unions dominate in Washington these days, but reform expands in four more states.</td>
      <td>It’s been a banner year for school choice in the states, and legislatures aren’t finished expanding scholarship and education savings account programs (ESAs). In four state budgets that passed in the last two weeks, lawmakers included provisions that give families more educational opportunities.<br />In New Hampshire last week, Republican lawmakers approved Education Freedom Accounts, which students can use toward such expenses as private school tuition, tutoring, textbooks and technology. Scholarship funds are available to families earning up to 300% of the federal poverty line at an average of $4,600, the state per-pupil funding amount for public school students. The state Education Department estimates the program could save the state at least $360 million over a decade.<br />On Wednesday Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf signed a budget that includes an expansion of a high-demand state tax-credit scholarship program. The GOP Legislature pushed the measure, but Mr. Wolf will now share the political credit. The Educational Improvement Tax Credit cap will rise by $40 million to $175 million for K-12 scholarships, enough to fund an estimated 13,000 more students. The expansion “shows that the commonwealth is placing the focus on children, not on any one educational model,” said state Sen. Scott Martin.<br />Ohio lawmakers packaged several school-choice provisions into their budget that Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed Wednesday. These include funding for high-performing charter schools and higher scholarship values for the state’s voucher program. The Legislature also created a new K-12 ESA program, which offers students a modest $500.<br />In Arizona the Legislature raised the funding cap for a special-needs tax-credit scholarship program and allowed low-income students at struggling public schools to switch to the state’s ESA program without a waiting period. The shame is that lawmakers, including three Republicans, rejected an expansion of ESAs to 600,000 more low-income students.</td>

      <td>Years of investigation and prosecutors come up with a small tax case.</td>
      <td>Democrats of all stripes have devoted years to investigating Donald Trump and finding very little. The latest example is Thursday’s indictment of the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer for classifying employee benefits as business expenses rather than compensation.<br />Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr. and New York Attorney General Letitia James subpoenaed millions of documents and years of tax returns, and that’s all they’ve come up with. The indictment lists 15 criminal counts, including second degree grand larceny. But the evidence in the indictment boils down to misreporting compensation to the Internal Revenue Service and New York tax authorities.<br />Prosecutors allege that Allen Weisselberg, the 73-year-old accountant and CFO, received as much as $1.76 million in compensation over a 16-year-period—for cars, an apartment rental, and tuition for Mr. Weisselberg’s grandchildren at a private school—in a way that kept them off the books for tax purposes. The indictment says he avoided paying $901,112 he owed in taxes and collected federal and state tax refunds of $133,124 he wasn’t entitled to.<br />If true and willful, this is rotten behavior. But it isn’t Teapot Dome, and disguising compensation as expenses is far from unusual in corporate America. It’s typically handled as a civil matter and settled with the payment of back taxes, interest and fines. It is rarely the basis for a criminal indictment.<br />The prosecutors are throwing the book at Mr. Weisselberg to get him to turn state’s evidence against the former President. The same goes for the highly unusual decision to indict the Trump Organization, which is presumably intended to squeeze its business prospects. Notably, neither Mr. Trump nor his children who run the business were charged.</td>

It’s the result of the economy reopening in more states, but the jobs recovery would be faster without the $1.9 trillion spending bill Democrats passed this spring.<br />The top-line number beat most estimates with private employers adding 662,000 jobs. A big bump was to be expected after states lifted almost all of their business restrictions. Vaccines last month were widely available, and people exhausted by lockdowns have been eager to go out. Reservations on OpenTable in many states are higher than the same time in 2019.<br />Most jobs added last month were in industries that reopened, especially leisure and hospitality (343,000), state and local education (229,700) and retail (67,100). The household survey was more pessimistic and showed unemployment increased by 168,000, which caused the jobless rate to tick up to 5.9% from 5.8%.<br />While the household and establishment surveys don’t always match, last month’s disparity appears to be due in part to the huge increase in part-time work (408,000) and decline in reported self-employment (183,000). These differences tend to re-align over time.</td>

      <td>The decision invalidates a Trump administration plan intended to be a big compromise between farmers and refiners</td>
      <td>A federal appeals court Friday struck down a 2019 rule-change to expand summertime ethanol sales, saying the Trump administration overreached its authority when it lifted a ban on gasoline with a higher ethanol content.<br />The decision is a loss for corn farmers who have come to rely on ethanol sales for a large part of their revenue. They had aggressively lobbied President Trump to have the Environmental Protection Agency allow for a summertime expansion of the fuel in 2019, in part because it was one of the few options for growing ethanol sales.<br />Friday’s ruling may leave the ethanol lobby with little to show from four years of advocacy from Mr. Trump. It fully throws out a deal that the Trump administration had framed as its compromise between refiners and farmers, two big Republican allies that have long fought over federal mandates for adding corn-based, or “renewable fuel,” to gasoline. And the ruling is the second federal-court decision in roughly a week to undo an Trump EPA effort that intended to boost ethanol sales.<br />In that first decision, issued June 25, the Supreme Court had allowed small petroleum refineries to obtain exemptions. Iowa farmers had appealed directly to Mr. Trump to more closely limit those exemptions, making it central to his reelection campaign in a swing state.<br />Friday’s decision came from a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which said the EPA had improperly reinterpreted legal language in the Clean Air Act long understood as limiting ethanol to 10% of the content of gasoline during four summer months. Once the court undid that decision, it said the rest of the rule was moot, overturning other parts of the package intended to help refiners as well.</td>

Mr. Trump, who is not the fool some imagine, knew winning the presidency was a dangerous mishap from a personal legal standpoint. Mr. Trump, until then, mainly tussled with sharpies who wanted only some of his money, not his destruction. He also knew that in our overgrown regulatory state, prosecutors can find something on anybody, even those who conduct their affairs with a scrupulousness foreign to Mr. Trump.<br />It’s “political,” Mr. Trump says of this week’s charges. Yes, inevitably and partly. That’s why people with Mr. Trump’s deep pockets and checkered history are unwise to go into politics, however much it might benefit the nation to have a broadly welcoming presidential talent pool.<br />The charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and New York Attorney General Letitia James are over the top for what amount to tax violations related to employee compensation. Larceny? Who stole what from whom? Mr. Trump’s company and its major-domo, Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg—though not Mr. Trump himself so far—are accused of doling out perks as normal business expenses, thereby avoiding  personal income and payroll taxes.<br />Mr. Trump’s lawyer said, probably accurately, that such complaints usually are settled as a civil matter with the Internal Revenue Service for the reasons alluded to above. The IRS cares mainly about getting maximum money at least cost for its enforcement efforts. Not so elected officials such as Mr. Vance and Ms. James. If the prosecution is a giant net loser financially for the state of New York, that’s fine with them.</td>

      <td>When you talk, it’s hard for anyone to interrupt. And a face staring back on screen is hard to ignore.</td>
      <td>After 14 months working from home, I have mastered the art of digital collaboration. What began as a clumsy series of video chats from my kitchen counter—plagued by technological difficulties and unfamiliarity—quickly became the most efficient and effective way to connect with colleagues and clients across the globe. I am proficient in BlueJeans, Teams, Webex, Meet, Chime and 8X8, but I have a black belt in Zoom, my preferred videoconferencing tool. I personalize my background, admit participants, put up my hand, pull up presentations, and mute and unmute myself as needed.<br />The efficiency and flexibility of videoconferencing is dominating discussions about the return to the office. As I think about a post-pandemic world, I am faced with the inevitable pivot back to in-person meetings, day-to-day interactions and the choices that must now be made: Is this a phone call, an email, a Zoom, a lunch, a coffee or a meeting?<br />Suddenly possibilities are opening up for more-tailored interactions and better time management. Some meetings are best conducted in person. But for investment bankers, a return to meetings may also mean a return to old practices and protocols that have tended to keep women in a corner of the room.<br />Zoom is the great equalizer. Everyone’s box is the same size. It doesn’t matter if you are the CEO or the summer intern, your real estate is the same. A box with a name but no title became a tool of empowerment. Your name and face are consistently visible, making you more memorable, familiar and known. When you speak it is very hard for anyone to interrupt and it is also very hard to be ignored with your face staring back. You get invited to a lot of meetings that you wouldn’t have attended if travel were involved. I have witnessed many women in investment banking, young women in particular, find their voices and project newfound confidence in this virtual square. Remember, this is an industry still dominated by men and the physical manifestations of assertiveness and power.<br />Over the course of my career I have pushed and shoved my way to the head of the conference table. Like many other women, for a long time I would choose a seat at the back of the room. I remember the gestures at me to move out of the way so others could get down to business. I remember what it was like at the far end of the table, so far from the client I had to flick my business card down the table in a desperate attempt to be acknowledged. Many times my business card remained stranded in the middle of the table at the conclusion of the meeting. Often these habits follow women as they climb the ranks.</td>

      <td>In his ‘Les Femmes d’Alger’ series, Pablo Picasso paid tribute to the French romantic Delacroix and generated an imaginative realm of his own.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />Artists have many muses. Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), who took possession of everything that moved him, found inspiration in artworks, memories, myths, places and lovers—reinventing his own work as much as that of other masters. Oftentimes, as with his long love affair with Eugène Delacroix’s two paintings of the same subject, “Women of Algiers in Their Apartment” (from 1834 and 1849, respectively), unraveling Picasso’s interwoven passions is nearly impossible.<br />In 1831-32, Delacroix (1798-1863) toured Morocco. A visit to a sultan’s apartment (harem) in Algiers inspired Delacroix’s two paintings, whose emotionally driven color laid the foundations for European Modernism. Each includes a reclining odalisque, two seated women around a hookah, and a female Black servant. The life-size figures in the 1834 version, twice as large as the 1849 painting, are equally illuminated, up-close. The 1849 version, darker and less distinct, is spatially deeper yet friezelike. Mysteriously dreamy, bathed in bronze light, its somnolent women appear like memories summoned in a post-coital fog.</td>

      <td>A large U.S. tenant-protection program has distributed a fraction of the $47 billion appropriated by Congress to cover rent and utility arrearages for millions of renters harmed by the coronavirus, the Treasury Department reported on Friday.<br />Just $1.5 billion of that money found its way into the hands of landlords and tenants through May 31 as local governments struggle to set up distribution programs, the Treasury said in the report. The aid began flowing to states and localities early this year through the Treasury.<br />Local governments across the U.S. have struggled with how to distribute the money, with most if not all setting up programs entirely from scratch. Some have complained that their staff are being deluged by a flood of aid requests, while numerous renters are being disqualified for failing to correctly complete their applications, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.<br />The Biden administration has extended for one final month an eviction ban that was first put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention back in September 2020. It is now set to expire July 31 and won’t be renewed, the administration says.<br />If the ban expires before more of the $47 billion in aid reaches landlords and tenants, it could result in a surge in evictions the money was intended to prevent, housing advocates say. About 4.2 million Americans report that it is very likely or somewhat likely that they will face an eviction or foreclosure in the next two months, according to Census Bureau data.</td>

The district attorney’s office, which is working with the New York attorney general’s office, accused the company and its CFO of carrying out a 15-year scheme to avoid taxes by using Manhattan apartments, luxury cars and private-school tuition as off-the-books compensation.<br />The Trump Organization and Mr. Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty, with their lawyers saying they will fight the charges.<br />The charges run far afield of the probe’s original focus—the Trump Organization’s handling of the payment to Ms. Daniels, which was intended to silence her about her allegations of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Former prosecutors said Thursday’s charges could become a steppingstone to filing broader charges against Mr. Trump himself, if Mr. Weisselberg were to seek leniency in return for testifying against his longtime boss.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court agreed to consider a new case about whether government tuition aid can be used at religious schools and declined to take up a closely watched appeal by a florist who didn’t want to provide services for a same-sex wedding.<br />Those actions on Friday were among a flurry of final orders issued by the court before the justices began a summer recess. The court added 10 new cases to its docket for its next term beginning in October.<br />The tuition case comes from Maine, where state law requires that a government-assistance program can only be used to pay for private education at nonsectarian schools. A Boston-based federal appeals court rejected a challenge to that requirement by families who would like tuition assistance for their children to attend Christian schools. The court said the Maine rules were constitutional and didn’t discriminate against the families based on their religion.<br />The case raises issues that weren’t resolved in a Supreme Court ruling last year that struck down a Montana exclusion of church schools from a state-aid program.<br />The court declined to consider religious-rights claims in the florist case, in which Washington state courts ruled Richland, Wash., business Arlene’s Flowers violated state antidiscrimination law by declining to sell wedding flowers to a gay couple.

      <td><br />It’s hard to think of summer 2021 without thinking about where things stood a year ago: The horror and uncertainty of the first few months of Covid-19 was lifting slightly, but the U.S. was in the midst of a reckoning on race and policing following the murder of George Floyd, all while a contentious presidential contest hummed along in the background. Billboard was tracking the Songs of the Summer, as it has since 2010, but the season never felt like one for celebrating. Survival was all one could hope for.<br />Twelve months later the number of those vaccinated continues to climb and, depending on where you live, it might be easy to forget a time when you went everywhere with a mask in your pocket. And the entire idea of summer music has regained its purpose. Perhaps because 2020 was so fraught, there are several currently surging hits that date from albums released in the pandemic’s earliest days and couldn’t realize their true potential while the world was still in lockdown.<br />Foremost among these is the version of Dua Lipa’s “Levitating” that features rapper DaBaby. The original was released on her fantastic album “Future Nostalgia,” which came out in late March 2020, right as the first wave of Covid-19 was building. “It’s an album filled with anthems that will, for now, have to settle for soundtracking live-streamed videos . . . rather than the roaring public celebrations for which they were designed,” read my review. “But that time will come.” That time, it would seem, is now. “Levitating” is a slice of danceable pop perfection, and the song is currently hovering near the top of the Songs of the Summer chart.<br />Also riding high is a pair of tracks from the Weeknd’s excellent album “After Hours,” also from March 2020. The ’80s throwback “Blinding Lights,” first released as a single all the way back in November 2019 and a chart-topper a year ago February, has been a ubiquitous hit ever since and is rising again. The more melancholy “Save Your Tears,” first issued as a single last August, is currently in the Songs of the Summer top 10. These are tunes that sound different in this season, so it’s no surprise that listeners are cueing them up again.</td>

The documents included photos that show the 27-year-old woman with a swollen and bloodied face, along with medical notes from doctor visits that described her as having “significant head and facial trauma.”<br />MLB said it is continuing to collect information in its own investigation of the matter, concurrent with a criminal probe by the Pasadena Police Department. Players placed on administrative leave continue to get paid.<br />In a statement earlier this week, Bauer’s agent Jon Fetterolf said the relationship was consensual. “We have messages that show [the woman] repeatedly asking for ‘rough’ sexual encounters involving requests to be ‘choked out’ and slapped in the face,” the statement said.  He added that the woman left without incident after both of their encounters and that “she went on to dictate what she wanted from him sexually and he did what was asked.”<br />In a subsequent statement Friday, Bauer’s agents Fetterolf and Rachel Luba said they continue to refute the woman’s allegations but Bauer will not appeal MLB’s decision “in an effort to minimize any distraction to the Dodgers organization and to his teammates.”</td>

The unemployment rate rose to 5.9% from 5.8%, exceeding economists’ expectations of a 5.6% rate.<br />Some analysts and investors said that the number of jobs added was encouraging but not an overwhelming sign that the labor market is healing at an accelerating pace. The U.S. still has 6.8 million fewer jobs than in February 2020, before the pandemic shut down most of the economy. Labor force participation, or the share of adults working or looking for work, remains below pre-pandemic levels, prompting some companies to raise wages in order to fill roles.</td>

Cable service providers ink deals with manufacturers to produce set-top boxes and modems for their customers; those manufacturers propose designs and coordinate with the service providers on which chips they will use.<br />“While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us and continuing to focus on supporting our customers through an environment of accelerated digital transformation,” Broadcom said in a statement. “We are equally pleased that the FTC investigation into our other businesses has been closed without action,” it added.</td>

      <td>Merely returning audit rates to the levels they were at a decade ago would raise $200 billion in revenue.</td>
      <td>Your editorial “A Bipartisan Pact to Supersize the IRS” (June 26) opposes revitalizing the Internal Revenue Service to collect more taxes that are legally owed but not paid. It claims that revenue gains would be small because “it makes little sense that millions of Americans are willfully violating the tax code.”<br />But the extent of nonpayment should not be judged subjectively. Look instead to the results of the IRS’s random audit program. It shows that nearly 15% of taxes owed are not paid, resulting in a tax gap of around $600 billion annually. Over a decade, the infrastructure deal aspires to reduce that gap by less than 1.5%.<br />This evasion is disproportionately on the high end. Yet as the IRS workforce has been reduced to 1970s levels, the drop off in scrutiny has been highest for the rich. My work with Natasha Sarin shows that audit rates have fallen so drastically for those making $500,000 or more annually, that their audit rate is only 1%, around the same as those receiving the earned-income tax credit.<br />Your editorial suggests that the only way to raise $100 billion in revenue from tax-gap investments would be to audit “nearly every high-income taxpayer in the country.” But merely returning audit rates to the levels they were at a decade ago—when less than 10% of millionaires were audited annually—would raise twice as much.<br />The bipartisan infrastructure proposal provides the IRS $40 billion to recruit and train revenue agents to police sophisticated tax evasion. After its enactment, the IRS still will not be auditing the vast majority of the top 1% of taxpayers—and still will leave on the table huge potential revenue collections.</td>

Her assessment that voters realize they are amid a crime wave and cannot afford to ignore law and order is based on the fact that the three “more or less reality-oriented moderates” in the election received 63% of the first-choice vote.<br />Applauding New Yorkers for favoring the slightly less-progressive and less-hostile-to-police candidates in a city plagued by crime is a stretch. Eric Adams, with less than a third of the total, and Andrew Yang, with 12%, staked out pro-police turf. But the other candidates’ positions on policing ranged from redirecting the police budget to community-service projects to tightening controls on police and guns. Ms. Noonan included a third candidate, Kathryn Garcia (19%), in her list of moderates, even though her primary crime-control fixes are gun suppression, gun buybacks and zero tolerance for police behavior that is anything but perfect.

      <td>Historian Walter McDougall admires the founders’ ideals—but with a wink rather than a woke scowl or a reverent gaze.</td>
      <td>There are two interpretations of 1776 that matter in 2021. Call them the Whig and the woke.<br />The Whig version is a story of progress. It interprets the founding as an imperfect expression of political ideals that have come steadily closer to realization over time. That’s more or less the vision that many red states are trying to salvage with measures against “critical race theory” in K-12 schools. Florida’s Board of Education enacted a rule last month that public-school teachers “may not define American history as something other than the creation of a new nation based largely on universal principles stated in the Declaration of Independence.”<br />Such mandates are a response to woke history, which takes a darker view. Instead of arguing that “this country has not been living up to its ideals,” says the historian Walter McDougall, the woke “believe this country does not have any ideals,” or at least any worth striving for. Rather than trace how the past’s aspirations reverberate in the present, woke history selectively imposes modern politics onto the past.<br />Mr. McDougall, 74, stands apart from this increasingly salient divide. In a Zoom interview from his home in suburban Philadelphia, he says that in their zeal to pass judgment, the woke “either don’t know how to think historically or they don’t want to think historically.” But he’s also wary of popular interpretations of history that tell Americans “they’re exceptionally virtuous” which he says is “either naively silly, or it is downright dangerous.”<br />That outlook informs his two volumes of American history through the Reconstruction period, “Freedom Just Around the Corner” (2004) and “Throes of Democracy” (2008). “I granted the high ideals which the American Founding Fathers stood for,” Mr. McDougall says, “but I also did so with a wink”—as distinct from the woke scowl, but also distinct from the Whig’s reverent gaze. He says that the American colonists were “scofflaws” and emphasizes that “the genius of the American people is that so often their corruption is creative.”</td>

      <td>Falls Church, Va.<br />My wife, Kristin, and I started paying close attention to the debate over school reopening at the end of 2020. Our elder son starts kindergarten in the fall, so we are about to have serious skin in the game.<br />In December, Virginia was still largely in lockdown mode. Parents were starting to get desperate about getting their kids back to in-person learning. But the seven-member school board in our small city had other priorities. It repeatedly deferred to the superintendent on pandemic policy and instead debated whether to change the names of Thomas Jefferson Elementary and George Mason High School.<br />The board paid a consultant to conduct a survey on whether those Virginian Founding Fathers’ slave ownership meant their names shouldn’t adorn school buildings. Three-quarters of the community members surveyed wanted to keep the names; the margins were smaller but still significant for current parents, students and staff. Overall, 56% of survey respondents supported keeping the names, about a quarter wanted to change them, and the rest had no opinion. Yet the board unanimously voted to rename.<br />That caught my attention. Regardless of the merits of Jefferson and Mason, how could elected officials be so oblivious to public sentiment? And this had nothing to do with national politics; Falls Church went 80% for Joe Biden in November, so the renaming survey didn’t reflect some inherent partisan divide.</td>

      <td>From paintings to puppets to textiles, the 20th-century Swiss artist made work that challenged expectations.</td>
      <td>Between the world wars, Sophie Taeuber-Arp tackled nearly every genre of visual art while fleeing, and sometimes mocking, the fascism that was creeping across Europe. But despite her influence during the 1920s and 1930s, Taeuber-Arp is little known outside of Switzerland, where she was born in 1889. From 1995 to 2016 her face was on a Swiss bank note.<br />Now a new exhibition will give audiences in London and New York a chance to encounter this 20th-century Renaissance woman, whose work included painting, architecture, interior design, fashion design, woodworking and performance. After its debut at the Kunstmuseum Basel this spring, “Sophie Taeuber-Arp” opens on July 15 at the Tate Modern in London, before moving to New York’s Museum of Modern Art in November.<br />Taeuber-Arp’s best-known work was produced during World War I, when she was an active participant in the subversive Dada movement in Zurich. Her painted wood “Dada Heads” from 1916-20 include a droll portrait of Jean Arp, one of the movement’s founders, whom she met in 1915 and married seven years later. The exhibition also includes the whimsical marionettes that she made in 1918 for the play “King Stag,” which rarely travel from their home in Zurich because of their delicacy. “They are full of humor, they are full of joy, they are incredible fun,” said Tate Modern international curator Natalia Sidlina, “and at the same time, very conceptual and very witty pieces of art.”<br />At trade schools in Switzerland and Germany, Taeuber-Arp studied textile design, which was traditionally considered an “applied” rather than a “fine” art. But in works like “Embroidery” (ca. 1920), a colorful abstract made of wool on canvas, she challenged that distinction. The show includes two versions of the 1917 work “Elementary Forms: Vertical-Horizontal Composition,” a wool textile and a gouache painting made as a preparatory design. The painting has more detail while the textile is brighter and more textured, but they are nearly mirror images, raising the question of why one should be considered art and the other craft.<br />Similarly, the exhibition includes Taeuber-Arp’s “Oval Composition With Abstract Motif” (1922), a striking oval rug blazing with autumnal colors and geometric abstraction, along with a series of gouache patterns that could stand alone as remarkable miniatures. “That’s the thing about her: you don’t distinguish between what’s fine art, what’s drawing, what’s design,” Ms. Sidlina said. “It’s an incredible visual encounter.”</td>

The military’s statistics show that even though the Pentagon has said it has made a priority of preventing sexual assault and harassment in the ranks, reported incidents have doubled in the past decade.<br />The White House will push Congress to enact legislation making the necessary legal changes, and then give the military until 2023 to implement them, senior administration officials told reporters during a telephone briefing.<br />The changes are aimed at “professionalizing the sexual-assault response” within the military, one of the administration officials said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Business litigants overall have fared well at the Supreme Court in recent years but their gains were more incremental during the court’s just-ended term, and while they won a few big cases, others ended in one-sided defeats.<br />Wins for the business community included rulings that cut back on unions’ physical access to farmworkers, raised a new bar for some consumer class-action lawsuits and removed a hurdle for the construction of natural-gas pipelines.<br />But those were balanced against losses in which the court declined to make it harder to bring certain product-liability and securities-fraud lawsuits. The justices also affirmed antitrust liability for the National Collegiate Athletic Association.<br />The 2020-21 term, which ended this week, was the first for a court with a conservative majority that now enjoys a 6-3 advantage thanks to the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Most business rulings, however, didn’t fall along those ideological lines.<br />“If people thought the new conservative appointees would march in lockstep with the Chamber of Commerce, that’s not what is happening,” said lawyer Deepak Gupta, whose practice focuses on representing consumers and workers. “The picture is a lot more complex.”</td>

      <td>By all means, celebrate the June employment report. Just don’t consider it the last word on what is happening with the job market.<br />The Labor Department on Friday reported that the economy added 850,000 jobs last month, more than the 706,000 economists expected and a welcome step up from May’s addition of 583,000 jobs and April’s 269,000.<br />There were big gains in a number of services categories, such as restaurants and retailers—a reflection of how, with the easing of the Covid-19 crisis, the job market is healing. The strength of the report also suggests worries about the availability of workers, while valid, may have been somewhat overstated.<br />But if drawing conclusions from one month’s set of numbers is always dangerous, it is doubly so now. The pandemic has thrown many of the old patterns of hiring out of kilter, and the resulting volatility is getting magnified by the adjustments the Labor Department makes to account for seasonal swings in hiring.<br />Take jobs in education as an example. In a usual year these register a big decline in June, as schools let out for summer. The Labor Department’s seasonal adjustment process anticipates this decline, bumping up the June figures to get a better sense of where the job market is trending. Then in the fall, as schools go back in session, it adjusts the figures down.</td>

      <td>In a candid new memoir, the Yankees great reveals how he learned ‘to ask for help’ with a devastating addiction.</td>
      <td>Carsten Charles “CC” Sabathia, Jr., was, in his own words, “a disciplined drunk.” He spent most of his career drinking nothing but water and Gatorade for two days before ascending the mound to pitch. But he needed a Crown Royal and Sprite the moment he left the field and would spend the next three days “absolutely ripped”—starting fights, blacking out and ”pissing in the bed.”<br />In his new memoir “Till the End,” which will be published July 6, Mr. Sabathia, 40, writes that he knew he had a problem. At Beyoncé’s surprise 40th-birthday party for Jay-Z in 2009, his wife Amber found him passed out naked on a lounge chair. After another bender at home in Alpine, N.J., he crashed his souped-up 1972 Oldsmobile Cutlass through a neighbor’s steel fence and hit a tree.<br />“In baseball, if you’re getting the job done on the field, your teammates and the organization look the other way when it comes to what you’re doing off the field,” he writes. A six-time All-Star who pitched for the Cleveland Indians, the Milwaukee Brewers and the New York Yankees, Mr. Sabathia delivered the goods. In 2007 his fastball earned him the Cy Young Award, baseball’s top pitching honor. Before retiring in 2019, he joined the small club of pitchers who racked up over 3,000 strikeouts. He is expected to enter the Hall of Fame.<br />Off the mound, however, his life was increasingly a mess. “I knew I needed help. I just didn’t know how to ask for it,” Mr. Sabathia says over the phone from his home, which he shares with Amber and their four children, who range in age from 10 to 17. In the “macho world” of baseball, he explains, players are expected to muffle their feelings, not reckon with them. As a Black man, he adds, there is a stigma against revealing weakness by seeking therapy. “We don’t really deal with emotions or pain or addiction or any of those things,” he says. “I never saw someone in my situation turn it around.”<br />Growing up in a close-knit family in Vallejo, Calif., Mr. Sabathia was 14, he writes in his memoir, when he first learned that Hennessy cognac  could numb some of his outsize feelings—his sadness that he rarely saw his father, his anger over the untimely deaths of uncles and cousins, his anxiety over disappointing his team. When he drank, he felt like the life of the party, though he was “wasted” at his own wedding in 2004 and ended up crying in a corner of the reception before passing out in his tuxedo.</td>

Based in Elk Grove, Ill., Fort Dearborn is dominant in North America, while Cincinnati-based Multi-Color has an extensive global presence. Together, they have annual sales of about $3 billion.<br />CD&R is buying Fort Dearborn and Multi-Color from private-equity firms Advent International Corp. and Platinum Equity, respectively. Advent acquired Fort Dearborn in 2016 from Denver-based KRG Capital Partners. Platinum took Multi-Color private in 2019 in a deal valued at $2.5 billion including debt and merged it with a subsidiary of its portfolio company WS Packaging Group, another label maker.<br />With offices in New York and London, CD&R has invested more than $35 billion in 100 companies since it was founded in 1978. This will be the latest in a string of big deals for the firm. On June 1, it announced a roughly $5.3 billion agreement to take software company  Cloudera Inc.  private alongside buyout firm KKR & Co., and it unveiled a deal Tuesday to buy London-listed UDG Healthcare PLC for a sweetened purchase price of about $3.9 billion.</td>

      <td>Bitcoin’s second-quarter selloff left a crater in the bull case for the highly speculative cryptocurrency.<br />The digital asset fell 41% in the second quarter, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That was the worst selloff since a 43% drop in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the fourth-worst drop in bitcoin’s decade-plus history.<br />“We can say with absolute certainty that the hype has left the market,” said Mati Greenspan, who writes the Quantum Economics newsletter. That is more of a problem for bitcoin than other assets, since bitcoin is driven largely by momentum and speculation.<br />Bitcoin certainly didn’t drop over any widespread meltdown. The S&P 500 rose 8.2% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 9.5%. U.S. crude oil rose 24% and even gold—the asset to which many bitcoiners compare the digital currency—rose 3.3%.<br />Throughout the quarter there was a steady drumbeat of questions, about bitcoin’s speculative frenzy, about its energy usage, about its risks. China cracked down on the industry, and regulators in a number of other countries raised questions as well. Elon Musk tweeted.</td>

      <td>One of the earliest beliefs that I still cling to in life is that I was born an American trapped in an Englishman’s body. That is the kind of story you manufacture about yourself when you grow up in a place like Liverpool in the 1980s. The city felt apocalyptic back then—a rotting, dilapidated carcass in grim decline.<br />To survive, I feasted on everything American I could lay my hands on—movies, television, music, books, clothes, the occasional pair of knockoff Ray Bans. They all made America feel like a land where life was lived in glorious  Technicolor ,  as opposed to my bleak reality in the North of England, which was lived in black and white.<br />I know some of this will sound trite. How could I love a nation based on the largely fictional stories, images and myths that it peddled about itself? But that knowledge doesn’t diminish the awesome power they held over me as I was coming of age with the Stars and Stripes and the Manhattan skyline painted as a mural on my bedroom wall.<br />I eventually made the self-deception real by moving here, having an American family and, finally, becoming a newly minted U.S. citizen a year before the pandemic struck. America has played roughly the same role for me that ballet played for Billy Elliott, inspiring joy, hope and laughter. I am who I am because of the lessons about life I gleaned as a kid from that star-spangled flood of pop culture streaming across the Atlantic. As a tribute to my new country on Independence Day, here’s what I learned.<br /></td>

That’s up from the 10.9% long-term return they expected in 2019, the previous round of the survey.<br />It’s also more than twice the return on U.S. stocks since 1926, which has averaged 7.1% annually after inflation.

      <td>Opulent reign of Eswatini’s King Mswati III has long stirred anger in a country wracked by poverty, HIV/AIDS</td>
      <td>JOHANNESBURG—A week of nationwide protests has left dozens of people dead in the tiny nation of Eswatini, raising the prospect that Africa’s last absolute monarchy could fall.<br />Soldiers deployed to restore order have fired live rounds at protesters who attacked government-affiliated buildings and businesses, according to video footage, rights groups and opposition leaders. Hospitals are filling up with the wounded. The internet has been shut down.<br />The government says the demonstrators are criminals who have looted property and contravened Covid-19 restrictions.<br />Whether the protests succeed or fail in ending the 35-year-rule of King Mswati III, whose lavish lifestyle has long angered many of his impoverished subjects, is being closely watched across the continent, where a clutch of aging autocrats have held power by violently suppressing protest for decades. Across Africa, entrenched older leaders are grappling with increasingly restless youthful populations demanding improved opportunities even as the coronavirus has devastated regional economies.<br />Eswatini, about three-quarters the size of New Hampshire, was known as Swaziland until 2018, when the king unilaterally changed the country’s name in his 50th birthday speech. An estimated 200,000 of the country’s population of 1.2 million are living with HIV/AIDS, according to the United Nations. Political parties have been banned since 1973, but opposition groups long seeking democratic reform point to indiscriminate and extravagant spending by the royal family as infrastructure in the country crumbles. Pandemic-related lockdown measures have magnified these grievances, hitting an already weak economy and fueling unrest.</td>

      <td>One tip for driving on the moon: Objects may be closer than they appear.</td>
      <td>You’ve landed on the moon. Now what? Take a walk, plant a flag, gather rocks and fly home. When in 1969 Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins splashed down at the end of the Apollo 11 mission, they fulfilled President Kennedy’s audacious dare. The animating goal of the space program had been met, and the public’s attention began to wane. Congress started cutting NASA’s budgets. In turn, NASA canceled several planned flights. The narrowly averted Apollo 13 disaster in 1970 convinced many taxpayers that their dollars were better spent elsewhere.<br />What rekindled interest in the space program was that most American of conveyances: the automobile. The lunar rover, built by contractors for $40 million on a frantic 17-month schedule, was a car for the moon. It reinvigorated the final three Apollo missions, from 1971 to 1972. The rover allowed for better communications, longer time on the lunar surface, and, most important, a vastly expanded range. In his compelling history of the rover’s place in the space program, “Across the Airless Wilds,” Earl Swift writes that, during Apollo 15, 16 and 17, astronauts drove it over 56 miles.<br />Contrast that with Armstrong’s and Aldrin’s bipedal wanderings. They estimated that they could cover only a half-mile on foot in their heavy, pressurized suits. Yet the moon’s surface was far more dynamic than the Sea of Tranquility, and deserved a thoroughgoing exploration. Its features include massive canyons and towering mountain ranges. Astronauts on Apollo 15 collected a 4 x 2-inch chunk of crystal anorthosite over 4 billion years old. NASA sought evidence of volcanic activity and detailed samples of the lunar crust. Such scientific discoveries were a far cry from Alan Shepard’s 6-iron, which became the corny star of Apollo 14. That was before astronauts could drive.<br />Mr. Swift, the author of seven previous works of nonfiction, lays out the genesis of the lunar rover and introduces the engineers who conceived and built it. He notes pointedly that many of them, like M.G. Bekker and Ferenc Pavlics, were immigrants. Unlike other landmark books about the space program, “Airless Wilds” is not a story of fighter pilots or sudden explosions. Instead it is a chronicle of incremental progress: meticulous planning, working under deadline, the satisfactions of a job well done. Such are Mr. Swift’s narrative talents and the bounties of the source material that the book is a joy to read from beginning to end.<br />Early concepts for some sort of moon vehicle ranged from the creative to the absurd. Mr. Swift situates readers in an analog era of gray space suits and crooked antennae dreamed up by men in thin neckties. One design in the mid-1950s showed a car “shaped like an overgrown Tootsie Pop, with its spherical cabin up top of a single long leg, which in turn was mounted on a caterpillar-tread foot.” It would leap as high as 410 feet. Another early idea featured “a triangular rover that high-stepped along on six jointed legs” and explored with “crablike pincers.” NASA became serious about building a rover in the late 1960s and issued a request for proposals. Firms like Bendix, Chrysler and Grumman submitted detailed bids, but Boeing and its subcontractor General Motors won the commission.</td>

      <td>With Cambodia’s borders still closed, one of the world’s most famous landmarks is a ghost town while the tourist hub of Siem Reap has reverted back into a sleepy country village. A travel writer reflects on a possible silver lining to the visitor ban.</td>
      <td>IN MID February 2020, I spent a few days in Siem Reap, the Cambodian city just outside the ruins of Angkor Wat. One night, I went to see the drag queen show at the Barcode nightclub where I watched a performer named Kabah, wearing a silver dress, lip-sync to Whitney Houston’s “One Moment in Time.” Patrons sat at the bar and at banquettes nursing martinis and bottles of Angkor Beer. I didn’t realize it at the time—no one did—but this really was one moment I would have a lot of time to think back on. For the next year and a half, I, a travel writer perpetually in motion, would be grounded, rarely leaving my apartment in Manhattan.<br />I’ve done a lot of unorthodox things for the sake of writing about them: I’ve eaten a still-beating snake heart in Vietnam; I’ve hiked for days across part of Kenya; I’ve gotten tipsy on vodka with old Ukrainian ladies in Chernobyl’s exclusion zone. But staying home for a year and a half? It was inconceivable.<br />I once wrote a magazine profile of filmmaker John Waters. He wanted to go hitchhiking. After we were picked up down the street from his Baltimore home, he looked back at me and said, “I think it’s dangerous to stay home. Never going out and seeing the world and meeting new and interesting people? Now, that’s dangerous.” For the next year and a half, Waters’s proclamation would be flipped on its head.<br />On the last morning in Siem Reap before my flight back to New York, I planted myself at a table outside a cafe sipping an espresso and watching a stray chicken trying to decide if it was going to cross the road. At the time, the virus was still more or less contained within Wuhan (or so we thought). And some of the people I met there speculated about it—all with a sense of unease about the potential of a pandemic—wondering if this invisible invader was going to cross the road as well. Almost eclipsing that sense of unease, though, was general excitement about the changes afoot in Siem Reap. Most visitors based themselves in the city to visit the nearby complex of fabled Hindu and Buddhist temples. But in recent years, the town of 140,000 people had evolved into a destination in itself, adding more luxury hotels, cocktail lounges, art galleries, boutiques and innovative Cambodian restaurants.<br />Back in 1901, Siem Reap consisted of three neighboring villages. That same year some of the first Western tourists arrived, lured by word of ancient temples overtaken by the jungle. By 1909, the first hotel opened, Hotel des Ruins. In 1932, the Grand Hotel d’Angkor (now run by the Raffles hotel group) swung open its doors. But by 1975, under the threat of the Khmer Rouge, Siem Reap became depopulated, as town dwellers fled to the countryside. The Grand Hotel d’Angkor shut down and was used as a prison, then reopened in 1997 once Raffles acquired it.</td>

      <td>From lottery tickets to medical books, the Society for the Suppression of Vice saw immorality everywhere.</td>
      <td>In 1873 a new federal law prohibited the distribution and promotion through the U.S. postal service of “obscene, lewd or lascivious” material. The legislation covered not only dirty postcards and sex toys but also pamphlets about contraception and sexual health. A booklet about marital relations or an abortifacient powder was now considered as indecent as an advertisement for a brothel. In “The Man Who Hated Women,” Amy Sohn tells us that the law “dealt a near-century-long blow to women’s health.” She argues that the vigorous prosecution of this law represents a prudish misogyny that dates from America’s Puritan founders and still prevails in some corners of the country today.<br />The censorious crusader responsible for this cruel initiative, known as the Comstock Law, was Anthony Comstock, a pugnacious bully with red muttonchop whiskers and size-13 boots, a pious Congregationalist and fervent believer in the Victorian ideal of womanhood—the so-called angel in the house. Comstock claimed that “he revered women,” Ms. Sohn tells us, “but he felt that he should dictate how they should conduct their lives, and that he was the protector of women’s natural innocence.” Born in New Canaan, Conn., in 1844, he worked for a time as a store clerk but eventually turned to anti-vice activism, offended by what he regarded as the moral corruption of Gilded Age New York.<br />During those years, New York was the center of both great wealth and extraordinary poverty. The city teemed with crime, violence and pornography. Bookstores openly sold smut; gambling salons and illegal lotteries proliferated; and prostitutes roamed the streets. Comstock was particularly outraged by the widespread advertisements for and easy availability of contraception and abortion services. These were among the few protections women had against unwanted pregnancies and the dangers of childbirth, but Comstock lumped them together with “sinful” practices. He persuaded the Manhattan branch of the YMCA to form a Committee for the Suppression of Vice, and then, as its representative, he went to Washington to lobby for much harsher penalties against obscenity peddlers.<br />“To garner support for his obscenity act,” writes Ms. Sohn, “Comstock organized the most vivid exhibition of sex toys the capital had ever seen.” The politicians crowded into the show, handled the toys and cards, and told him they would pass any law he wanted. The resulting Comstock Act of 1873 glided through Congress unchallenged. Over the next 12 years, 24 state legislatures passed similar “little Comstock laws.”<br />Shortly after his namesake legislation was passed, Comstock founded the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to help “enforce state and federal obscenity laws.” In the two decades that followed, Comstock spearheaded thousands of lawsuits that centered on materials as diverse as lottery tickets, pornography and medical books written by physicians.</td>

      <td>The company’s founder is departing with the business in fantastic shape, but Amazon’s sheer size has put a target on its back</td>
      <td>In a way, incoming  Amazon . com Chief Executive Andy Jassy would seem to have an easy job ahead. He’s inheriting a company that appears to be firing on all cylinders, after all.<br />With founder and CEO Jeff Bezos literally blasting off this month, the $1.7 trillion dollar enterprise Mr. Bezos founded in his garage nearly 27 years ago falls to new hands for the first time. In a sense, Amazon is a bit of a laggard in that it will be the fourth of the five companies known colloquially as “big tech” to make the transition from founder control. And the first three— Apple Inc.,   Microsoft  and Google-parent Alphabet Inc.—all managed to reach new levels of financial success under their subsequent leaders.<br />But the stakes at Amazon are even larger. Apple—currently the world’s most valuable company—had about one-quarter of Amazon’s current annual revenue when Steve Jobs resigned as CEO in 2011, just weeks ahead of his passing. As Mr. Bezos’s anointed successor, Mr. Jassy is taking over a company now generating more than $400 billion a year in revenue, while still averaging an annual growth rate of 30%. The Amazon Web Services cloud business that Mr. Jassy has run since its inception in 2006 has been a major part of that—especially when it comes to the bottom line. Amazon’s operating profits have surged more than fivefold in just three years.<br />Wall Street expects Amazon to surpass  Walmart  to become the largest U.S. company by annual sales next year, according to consensus estimates from FactSet. Five years ago, the e-commerce pioneer was barely a quarter the size of the massive retailer. The cloud business that Mr. Jassy has built up within Amazon has also blown past most rivals. With revenue now over $48 billion, AWS now eclipses corporate software titans  Oracle Corp.  and  Salesforce .  Analysts currently expect AWS’s revenue to roughly equal  IBM ’s  next year.<br />Amazingly, e-commerce and corporate IT services don’t comprise all of Amazon’s businesses. The company now runs a major grocery chain, an online pharmacy business and also produces an estimated $24 billion a year in advertising revenue. Its media ambitions are also vast; Amazon now makes videogames, runs a music streaming service and produces blockbuster-sized movies and TV shows. Its pending acquisition of MGM would give it access to major Hollywood franchises such as James Bond.</td>

At the end of this year’s first quarter, Americans age 70 and above had a net worth of nearly $35 trillion, according to Federal Reserve data. That amounts to 27% of all U.S. wealth, up from 20% three decades ago.

And many recipients are guided by different priorities and politics than their givers.<br />Older generations will hand down some $70 trillion between 2018 and 2042, according to research and consulting firm Cerulli Associates. Roughly $61 trillion will go to heirs—increasingly millennials and Generation Xers—with the balance going to philanthropy. The transfer will provide another display of the outsize economic power of baby boomers, who came of age during a wave of post-World War II prosperity and drove the economy through many stages of their lives.<br />The average inheritance in 2019 was $212,854, up 45% from an inflation-adjusted $146,844 in 1998, according to an analysis of Fed data by economists at a unit of Capital One Financial Corp.</td>

      <td>Michael Punke’s imagined Crazy Horse is not the superhuman hero of myth, but a canny nuts-and-bolts strategist.</td>
      <td>In his short, spirited biography of Crazy Horse, Larry McMurtry pointed out that there are fewer verifiable facts about the Lakota war leader than there are about Alexander the Great, who lived some 2,000 years earlier. The legend that has arisen from the gap is as outsized as that of any figure in history. “The Crazy Horse cult . . . is an amazing thing,” wrote historian George E. Hyde. “They depict Crazy Horse as the kind of being never seen on earth: a genius of war, yet a lover of peace; a statesman, who apparently never thought of the interests of any human being outside his own camp; a dreamer, a mystic, and a kind of Sioux Christ, who was betrayed in the end by his own disciples.”<br />Michael Punke’s novel “Ridgeline” (Holt, 371 pages, $27.99) is about one of Crazy Horse’s early battlefield triumphs, and from the beginning the warrior is presented as a man apart: “It was obvious that Crazy Horse was different, his skin and hair lighter than the others’ in his tribe.” It is 1866 and a U.S. Army battalion, with a bogus land treaty as pretext, has been ordered to build a fort at the base of the Bighorn Mountains in the Wyoming Territory to serve as a way station into Montana. But the fort is in the heart of the Lakota Sioux’s sacred hunting ground. Crazy Horse shares his tribe’s conviction that the fort must not be allowed to remain, but he understands that the enemy’s weaponry and manpower make it impregnable to typical assaults. “They had to learn, to change,” he decides.<br />“Ridgeline” builds toward the skirmish that is sometimes called the Fetterman Fight, after Capt. William Fetterman, in which a detachment of 81 American soldiers were lured away from the fort and killed by an alliance of Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors, a slaughter that came to be seen as a preface to the debacle at Little Bighorn. Crazy Horse is said to have been one of the decoys who tricked the Americans into exposing themselves. Mr. Punke makes him the mastermind behind the military strategy, the man with the insight and authority to impose tactical discipline on tribes accustomed to winning glory through individual feats of combat.<br />As a figure of lore, then, this Crazy Horse is fairly down to earth and immensely sympathetic, preoccupied with the nuts and bolts of battlefield maneuvers while gnawingly aware of the longer-term threat facing his people. Mr. Punke, the author of “The Revenant,” also turns his focus on the American soldiers, but these are a comparatively boorish group of characters and the reason for dramatizing their squabbles seems to be to show which of the Army officers was most culpable for the defeat. (I gather that Mr. Punke has adopted a revisionist position on the matter.) Like the Lakota fighters, the reader is eager for the waiting to end and the showdown to arrive. It eventually does, in a thrilling, gut-twisting series of sprung traps and harrowing violence—an action sequence that’s very much the stuff of legend.<br />The resistance against overreaching government forces is again the theme in Claire Boyles’s debut collection, “Site Fidelity” (Norton, 194 pages, $25.95), whose short stories are set mostly in present-day Colorado, but this time the conflicts are between environmentalists and the ranchers and farmers who want to use their land without interference. “Ledgers” stages a clash over the protection of an endangered species of sage grouse. In “Early Warning Systems” a crusading receptionist at a water-treatment facility risks her career exposing a chemical spill by a local construction crew. A rebellious nun in “Sister Agnes Mary in the Spring of 2012” tries to sabotage a fracking drill rig being installed next to a school playground. Ms. Boyles usually takes the side of the activists and their calls for regulation. But in “Chickens,” bullying government agents, empowered by a post-bird-flu law banning outdoor poultry flocks, try to confiscate a harmless woman’s beloved hens, to unexpectedly shocking results.</td>

      <td>The songwriter, now 88, writes to God, to country, to friends, to marijuana and to a certain virus.</td>
      <td>Willie Nelson needed something to do during the lockdown, so he decided to write some letters—to the Almighty, to friends living and dead, to his younger self, even to the Covid virus. The result, as collected in “Willie Nelson’s Letters to America,” is a mix of mash notes, fond memories, a hill-country homily or two, and some world-class examples of filler material, including this gem, one of a series of gag-worthy jokes, lifted from Reader’s Digest: “It was raining cats and dogs!” “How could you tell?” “I stepped in a poodle!”<br />A crack of that caliber would earn most books a trip to the fire pit, but Mr. Nelson’s fans won’t mind. They’ll also enjoy his retellings of fabled events from his life, including mistakenly mailing a bill for a girlfriend’s maternity services to his then-wife; asking a nephew to pull his car into a burning garage in order to collect the insurance money; and creating hits like “Crazy,” “On the Road Again” and the epic “Red Headed Stranger.”  What fans and other readers will cherish most is the tone of the project, alternately raucous, reverent and bittersweet.<br />Mr. Nelson, now 88, has traveled a long and interesting road. His journey didn’t start out in first class. He and sister Bobbie—the recipient of perhaps his most heartfelt letter—were initially raised by grandparents. “After my granddaddy died,” he recalls, “times were even tougher. For Thanksgiving dinner one year, we split a can of soup!” He felt flush when he began making $8 a night playing in a polka band; his musical income was eventually augmented by gigs trimming trees (for 80 cents an hour) and selling Bibles and encyclopedias.<br />His blossoming songwriting talent was not accompanied by a similar escalation in business smarts. “I sold my songs Family Bible and Night Life—lock, stock, and writing credits—for $50 and $150, respectively,” he writes. He thanks crooning cowboy Faron Young for refusing to buy his early hit “Hello Walls” for $500. “He said I was crazy and instead loaned me $500.” Young’s recording of the song hit the top of the charts. “My first royalty check was $25,000!” The hits kept coming, including “Night Life,” “Funny How Time Slips Away,” “Mr. Record Man,” “Crazy,” “I Gotta Get Drunk” and “The Party’s Over.” His secret to songwriting success: “Keep it simple, stupid.”<br />Several letters go to friends and associates who helped him along the way, including event producer Gino McCoslin, a genius-level hustler. When Mr. Nelson confronted him about selling twice as many tickets as there was capacity at a Dallas venue, he responded: “Hell, the airlines do it all the time.” McCoslin was also known to put a sign on the exit indicating that it was the door to the restroom. “People would go out of the venue by mistake, then he’d charge ’em to get back in.” If he’d been born later, McCoslin might have made an excellent vice president for fee development at Ticketmaster.</td>

      <td>Telling stories as a distraction from the Black Death, Boccaccio’s characters relate a resourceful new approach to life.</td>
      <td>Scrambling for pandemic-related advice, pundits and podcasters have turned to Giovanni Boccaccio’s fictional masterpiece, “The Decameron.” Written in the 14th century at the height of the Black Death, which decimated Boccaccio’s Florence, the book centers on 10 well-bred youths—seven women and three men—who, deciding that they need a break from the plague’s ravages, escape to a villa outside the city.<br />Anyone who leafs through “The Decameron” hoping to discover particular guidance for our contemporary troubles, however, may struggle to find it. In “Love and Sex in the Time of Plague,” Guido Ruggiero tells us why that might be so—and, along the way, paints a sweeping portrait of Florentine cultural life during the origins of the Renaissance.<br />Once the 20-somethings in Boccaccio’s narrative arrive at the rural villa, they set about entertaining themselves by requiring each to tell one story a night for 10 nights. The 100 tales in “The Decameron” depict a world of lascivious priests, wandering wives, inventive seducers, amorous nuns, cuckolded husbands, and any number of tricksters and prank-players. The tales are designed not to counsel readers on their plague-related troubles so much as to distract them with humor and fantasy.<br />At first glance, it’s hard to see what such a work could possibly have to do with pandemics, then and now. And so Mr. Ruggiero, after nodding briefly to Covid-19, heads in another direction. A historian at the University of Miami, he shows how “The Decameron” illuminates the key social development through which Boccaccio (1313-1375) lived. No longer was noble blood a guarantee of social status, Mr. Ruggiero notes. Nor was money, by itself. Rather, low-born men and women could now acquire upward mobility—and high-born lords and ladies forestall downward mobility—through the adroit use of virtù: a mixture of strategic reason and self-control. This word captures a conception of life according to which one’s own resourcefulness could, on its own, enable a man—or, as Boccaccio believed, a woman as well—to prevail over the reversals of fortune. Two centuries later, as Mr. Ruggiero observes, it would be central to Machiavelli’s advice to leaders in “The Prince.”<br />Mr. Ruggiero recounts from “The Decameron,” for example, the story of King Agilulf of Lombardy. One night, a virile young servant sneaks into the queen’s bed. Under cover of darkness he makes love to her, she thinking all the while that her companion is the king. Agilulf himself, arriving shortly after and getting admiring murmurs from his wife thanks to his apparently newfound zest and technical skill, soon realizes what has happened. He decides to abandon his own planned lovemaking and pretend that he was indeed the one who had just been in her chamber. He recognizes that to respond with the anger and outrage he feels would cause both him and his wife public ridicule and personal embarrassment. He can retain husbandly stature in the eyes of his wife—and avoid a loss of stature in the eyes of his subjects—only if he appropriates the charms of another. By suppressing his desire for revenge, he demonstrates virtù.</td>

      <td>A tale of small stature and big personality.</td>
      <td>When you are a child, it is irksome when adults mistake you for being younger than you are. It’s even more galling if you are a child of small stature, for it may be your misfortune, as it is for the heroine of “Not Little” (Neal Porter, 38 pages, $18.99), to be taken as some kind of infant. “People look at me and ask if I’m in preschool,” the girl, Dot, complains in Maya Myers’s lively and understanding text. “At restaurants, they laugh when I order from the grown-up menu.” In Hyewon Yum’s colorful and expressive illustrations, we see why Dot says she’s small but not little: She’s brimming with vigor and personality.<br />One day at school there’s a newcomer named Sam, and he’s even smaller than Dot. A school bully takes note. In the cafeteria, the mean boy looks at Sam’s lunch: “That must be baby food.” Outraged, Dot intervenes in such a forceful way that she silences the place. In the aftermath, readers ages 4 to 8 see the bully taken aside by a teacher (turns out that he’s pretty small, too) and the start of a new friendship for two children who are emphatically not little.<br />The vast compendium of colorful “All-American toy ads” that Jim Heimann and Steven Heller have put together for “Toys” (Taschen, 523 pages, $40) makes this volume a mesmerizing time capsule. With commentary in English, French and German, the book reproduces 20th-century print advertisements for toys organized by decade, from model trains (1900) and teddy bears (1907) all the way through to the Nintendo Game Boy (1989) and Barney the Dinosaur plush toys (1998).<br />For adults, the book delivers one jolt of nostalgia after another. Which ads strike the old chords will depend, of course, on which years the reader might have been poring over catalogs, magazines and comic books. (Dick Tracy watches! Sea monkeys!) The selection offers an irresistible cavalcade of name-brand goodies, such as Meccano, Lincoln Logs, Silly Putty and Tinkertoys, along with weirder and, to the cold eye of the present, retrograde toys such as “noncombatant gas masks” from 1946 (“every ‘red-blooded’ boy will want one”) and the “Suzy Goose Housekeeping Set” from 1965, which came with a pink plastic dust pan and “a real Dupont sponge.”<br />The authors don’t seem much charmed by the ads they’ve compiled. They take a dark view of the purpose of toy advertisements, which, they write, “are gateways to a life of consumption.” Further, they observe, many toys were “advertised in aspirational ways and express life’s privileges and benefits of wealth, race, or ethnicity. Competitive buying and owning is not just an adult syndrome—it starts with molding kids’ behavior.” Well, sure: Companies were selling toys, and they wanted people to buy them. It’s still rather fun to look back and see how they did it.</td>

      <td>By David Hackett Fischer (1994)<br />1. David Hackett Fischer relates countless fascinating details about Paul Revere’s harrowing midnight ride to warn that “the regulars are coming out,” but his book concerns far more. Revere had been dispatched when it was learned that the British army was sending a force to destroy the colonists’ arsenal in Concord, Mass., and his alert would cost the Redcoats the vital element of surprise. Blood flowed in Lexington, Concord and along Battle Road throughout the British army’s nightmarish tramp back to Boston on April 19, 1775. That made it a “fine day,” in the view of Samuel Adams. Members of the colonial resistance had long been prepared to fight for their freedom. Britain’s use of force outraged most colonists, who, like George Washington, felt that “a brother’s sword has been sheathed in a brother’s breast.” Nor was it solely the colonists’ sense of betrayal that made this a pivotal day. Had the militiamen met with a crushing blow, the will to resist Britain’s professional army might have vanished throughout America. The outcome was not only a disaster for the British government; it bolstered the colonists’ belief in the power of armed resistance.<br />By Piers Mackesy (1964)<br />2. Principally, this is a study of the making and execution of British strategy in the only war Britain lost in a 150-year string of Anglo-French conflicts. Piers Mackesy focuses on Britain’s ministers, who were responsible for the army and navy, and on their two commanders in chief in the American theater after 1776. The choice for war, Mackesy contends, was an imperial dream of power undertaken to prevent France from profiting from American independence. Britain’s leaders never thought America could be conquered, but they believed that a defeat of the Continental Army, combined with America’s own war weariness, would lead to victory. Britain’s army failed, first, due to what Mackesy describes as the confusion of Gen. William Howe and later the passivity of Gen. Henry Clinton. But above all, Mackesy contends, London lost primarily because “for the first time England faced what she had never before faced: a world war in which it was unable to maintain maritime supremacy.”<br />By Andrew Jackson O’Shaughnessy (2013)</td>

      <td>Sprinting star Sha’Carri Richardson, the best American hope for gold in the women’s 100 meters at the Tokyo Olympics later this month, failed a doping test for a chemical found in marijuana, invalidating her win in the U.S. trials and likely knocking her out of the Games in the event.<br />Richardson accepted a one-month suspension, as permitted under international anti-doping rules for testing positive for a substance of abuse, according to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.<br />Richardson’s period of ineligibility began June 28, the date of her provisional suspension. Her sanction was reduced to one month because her use of cannabis occurred out of competition and was unrelated to sport performance, and because she successfully completed a counseling program regarding her use of cannabis, according to USADA.<br />USA Track and Field uses Olympic-trials results to qualify athletes in individual events, but it’s possible the governing body could select Richardson for the Olympic 4×100-meter relay on Aug. 6.<br />“Sha’Carri Richardson’s situation is incredibly unfortunate and devastating for everyone involved,” USATF said in a statement Friday morning. “Athlete health and well-being continue to be one of USATF’s most critical priorities and we will work with Sha’Carri to ensure she has ample resources to overcome any mental health challenges now and in the future.”</td>
