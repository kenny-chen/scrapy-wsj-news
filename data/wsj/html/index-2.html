      <td>Agreement valuing the division at $1.05 billion is expected on Monday</td>
      <td>CAE Inc.  is nearing a deal to buy  L3Harris Technologies Inc.’s  military-training division for $1.05 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, in a move that would expand the Canadian aerospace company’s defense business.<br />An agreement is expected Monday, assuming talks don’t fall apart, the people said.<br />The unit includes three main businesses: Link, which provides military training in the U.S.; Doss Aviation, which provides flight training to the U.S. Air Force; and AMI, which designs and makes simulator hardware. The business, which has about $500 million in annual revenue, is expected to be based in Tampa, Fla., after the deal’s close, the people said.<br />Saint-Laurent, Quebec-based CAE expects the deal to be accretive to earnings per share and forecasts cost savings of roughly 35 million to 45 million Canadian dollars a year in the second year post-close, the people said. It is to be funded by a private placement of roughly C$700 million, equivalent to about US$549.4 million, from two institutional investors, they said.<br />CAE has a market value of around C$9.5 billion. It has historically specialized in flight simulators and training devices and has been broadening its reach through several deals in recent months, though none anywhere near the size of the deal being discussed for the L3Harris unit.</td>

      <td>The Justices have a rare chance to clarify federal election law.</td>
      <td>Election laws have become a dangerous political flashpoint, as Americans recently learned the hard way. On Tuesday the Supreme Court will hear a potentially landmark case (Brnovich v. DNC) that offers an opportunity to restore the Voting Rights Act to its original purpose.<br />At issue is Arizona’s requirement that voters cast ballots on election day in their assigned precinct and its ban on ballot harvesting by outside groups. A majority of states require in-precinct voting, and 20 or so limit ballot harvesting, which allows third parties to collect ballots in bunches. Both rules are intended to bolster ballot integrity.<br />Democrats say this violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits states from adopting voting qualifications, standards, or practices that result in “denial or abridgement” of the right to vote “on account of race or color.” But they provide no evidence that Arizona’s rules limit minorities’ ballot access.<br />Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to stop states from disenfranchising blacks with underhanded methods like poll taxes and literacy tests. But Democrats now argue that any state regulation that makes it a little harder for anyone to vote violates the law—even if it applies equally to minorities and whites.<br />Importantly, the Voting Rights Act (VRA) puts the burden on plaintiffs to show that minorities, based on the “totality of circumstances,” have “less opportunity” than others “to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.”</td>

      <td>A second former aide accuses the Governor of sexual harassment.</td>
      <td>No one will ever mistake Andrew Cuomo for a sympathetic figure, so New York’s Governor is finding he has few allies as he confronts accusations that he sexually harassed two women who used to work for him. He nevertheless deserves a fair investigation of the facts without a rush to judgment, even if he refused to offer others the same due process.<br />Mr. Cuomo denies the allegations by Lindsey Boylan that have been known for some time. The second accuser, 25-year-old Charlotte Bennett, came forward Saturday in a  New York Times  story. The alleged behavior doesn’t rise to that of Matt Lauer, much less Harvey Weinstein. But the details, if true, suggest behavior that would get a CEO fired by current standards. Ms. Bennett says Mr. Cuomo made his inappropriate comments last June.<br />The 63-year-old Governor says he thought he was acting as a mentor to Ms. Bennett and “never made advances.” He first appointed a former federal judge to investigate, but on Sunday after criticism by Democrats that this was inadequate he asked state Attorney General Letitia James and a state judge to “jointly” appoint an independent counsel who would make the results of a probe public. Ms. James, who would like to be Governor herself, wants to conduct her own investigation.<br />The accusations emerge when Mr. Cuomo is already under fire for covering up the number of nursing-home deaths from Covid-19 after his administration ordered the homes to accept Covid patients from hospitals. The press largely ignored that scandal during the election year while Donald Trump was  Target  One, but Mr. Cuomo is finally and deservedly getting his turn in the pandemic dock. The left has never liked the Governor, or his bullying dominance of New York politics, and it now senses a chance to take him out if he runs for a fourth term in 2022 if not before.<br />In 2018 when Brett Kavanaugh was accused by Christine Blasey Ford of harassment without corroboration, Mr. Cuomo issued a statement saying “I believe Dr. Ford’s testimony is very compelling. Only a political skeptic could find a reason to disbelieve her. What is her possible motive to lie? . . . Here is one basic fact that badly hurts Judge Kavanaugh: Why won’t he take a polygraph? Dr. Ford did.”</td>

      <td>It’s not a mandate—it’s a tax. At least that’s Bernie Sanders’s pitch.</td>
      <td>As expected, the Senate’s parliamentarian ruled last week that mandating a nationwide $15 minimum wage cannot be done via budget reconciliation, with a mere 51 votes. Some progressives, including some in Congress, are not eager to reconcile with this procedural flaw. “Replace the parliamentarian,” Rep. Ilhan Omar tweeted. “This is unacceptable.”<br />Rep. Ro Khanna’s approach was in the same vein: “This is an advisory, not a ruling.” He called on Vice President Kamala Harris, as the Senate’s constitutional leader, “to disregard and rule a $15 minimum wage in order.” But doing so would mean the end, forever, of the longstanding Byrd rule, which governs reconciliation. President Biden, an institutionalist who gave a eulogy for the eponymous Senator Robert Byrd, seems unlikely to go for it. “He respects the parliamentarian’s decision and the Senate’s process,” the White House press secretary said.<br />Hence the shift to Plan B. Senator Bernie Sanders said he would work on “an amendment to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don’t pay workers at least $15 an hour.” That idea, he insisted, “must be included in this reconciliation bill.” Senator Ron Wyden said he wants “a 5 percent penalty on a big corporations’ total payroll if any workers earn less than a certain amount.”<br />But to sneak through reconciliation, any such provision would have to pass muster with the parliamentarian. One comparison is ObamaCare’s mandate to buy health insurance or else pay a penalty. When the GOP pushed to kill it in 2015, “the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the bill’s provisions to repeal the individual and employer mandates were extraneous,” as the Congressional Research Service later put it. That’s why the mandate remains law, though Republicans later cut its penalty to $0.<br />Even if the parliamentarian were swayed, passing a Plan B would require getting votes from Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema and West Virginia’s Joe Manchin. Mr. Manchin thinks $15 an hour is too high. “Eleven dollars is the right place to be,” he said recently.</td>

      <td>Intel agencies and public-health officials need to work together against security risks like Covid.</td>
      <td>In December 2019, unfamiliar and serious cases of pneumonia started to appear at hospitals in Wuhan, China. Doctors were stumped. They began sending off an unusually high number of samples to local labs for genomic sequencing to see if a new virus was lurking in patients’ lung fluid. By the end of the month, there were clusters of these pneumonia infections in at least three separate families, an indication that a new virus was spreading among people.<br />Any one of these and other events might have tipped us off that something dangerous was under way in China. Any one of them might have been picked up by a foreign intelligence service. But the press reporting is that U.S. health officials didn’t know these facts in December. American health officials seem to have had limited information about the seriousness of what was happening. It now seems that China’s own Center for Disease Control wasn’t informed. By January, many of the usual channels for public-health cooperation between the U.S. and China went dark.<br />In the U.S., there is a longstanding aversion to involving the tools of national security in public health. Health officials don’t want to cooperate with intelligence services for fear that it will impede their multilateral commitments or that intelligence groups will classify important sets of data. Many worry that every American working in a lab coat overseas will be perceived as a spy.<br />But without help from public-health officials, intelligence agencies are less equipped to spot relevant information. The intelligence community can’t protect sensitive public-health concerns unless public-health officials work with them and explain the issues. And without relationships in the public-health world, intelligence services may have a harder time sharing the information they do receive.<br />Covid proved that international conventions and cooperation can’t be the sole backstop in a crisis. We need more capability for gathering information when there are signs of outbreaks. This means we’ll have to rely on more-traditional national-security tools, including intelligence services.</td>

      <td>Recently I found myself with time on my hands, and I began to think about them. I’ve always written with my left hand, but about 50 years ago, when I was teaching English at Beaver College, I realized that I picked up a piece of chalk with my right hand when I was about to write on the blackboard. In recent years I’ve written shopping lists with my right hand because I write more clearly—albeit more slowly—with that hand. But I use my left hand for other kinds of writing, like editing something I’ve printed from the computer<br />When I tell people that I can write with either hand, they usually say: “So you’re ambidextrous.”<br />I’m not, though. I can’t throw a ball with my left hand, bat left-handed or play tennis left-handed. When I used to play basketball, I could never drive for a layup to my left. And jump shots were always with my right hand.<br />My right hand and arm are much stronger than my left. I open jars with my right hand, hold a hammer with my right hand, punch with my right hand, and pick up suitcases with my right hand. I hold the phone with my left hand, but that is supposedly a sign of right-handedness.<br />I use my left hand for most tasks that require fine motor skills. I brush my teeth with my left hand; I use a fork and spoon with my left hand. But I do some things requiring precision with my right hand. I use scissors and a screwdriver with my right hand. And I brush my hair with my right hand. I tried to use a screwdriver and scissors with my left hand. Couldn’t do it.</td>

      <td>Rescuing multiemployer plans is unwise and signals a willingness to do the same with failing state and local funds.</td>
      <td>After decades of mismanagement, state and local government pensions face unfunded liabilities topping $4.2 trillion. When a major public plan finally runs dry, you can bet Congress will bail it out no matter the crippling cost. Congressional Democrats’ Covid-relief package includes a multibillion-dollar bailout for union-affiliated private-sector multiemployer pensions. If politicians will bail out truckers’ and coal miners’ pensions, why would they turn away teachers and firefighters?<br />Multiemployer pensions are jointly run by labor unions and employers, often within the same or related industries. The most prominent, the financially troubled Central States plan, covers roughly 400,000 workers and retirees from more than 1,000 trucking companies. These pensions run on a mutual-insurance basis: Participating employers must cover the benefits promised by any employer that either goes bankrupt or withdraws from the plan. The reward for this unusual funding mechanism is much looser funding requirements and lower premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.—the federal agency that acts as a pension safety net.<br />But the mutual-insurance system is itself a critical flaw: Sometimes whole industries decline and pension funding disappears, as with trucking. Federal rules made the problem worse by allowing businesses to withdraw without funding all promised benefits.<br />Multiemployer pensions also significantly overestimated their future investment returns. In a 2017 study, the Government Accountability Office found that if Central States had received the 7.5% annual return it assumed from 2000 to 2014, it would have ended that period 91% funded. Instead, Central States received only 4.9% returns, leaving its funding at 40% and declining.<br />Today, more than 100 multiemployer pensions face “critical and declining” funding, according to the PBGC. Central States’ portfolio is expected to run dry in 2025, with other plans to follow. The PBGC’s multiemployer insurance fund will be exhausted by 2027.</td>

      <td>Iran rejected a European Union offer to hold direct nuclear talks with the U.S. in the coming days, risking renewed tension between Tehran and Western capitals.<br />Senior Western diplomats said Iran’s response doesn’t quash the Biden administration’s hopes of reviving diplomatic efforts to restore the 2015 nuclear deal, struck between Iran and six world powers and abandoned by the Trump administration in 2018. But they said it seemed to set a deadlock: Iran wants a guarantee it wouldn’t walk away from a meeting with the U.S. without some sanctions relief, which Washington has so far ruled out.<br />With Tehran escalating its nuclear activities in recent months in breach of the 2015 nuclear deal, the U.S. conducting airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias in Syria, and Iranian presidential elections in June, diplomats have warned that opportunities to ease tensions might now be imperiled.<br />Just 10 days ago, Western officials were hopeful that headway would soon be made toward relaunching the nuclear negotiations. The EU floated the idea of holding talks in Europe that would include all of the remaining participants in the 2015 deal -- Iran plus China, the U.K., France, German, and Russia,  as well as the U.S. The Biden administration immediately announced it would attend a meeting, with Washington’s envoy Rob Malley set to participate.<br />EU officials had been trying to get an agreement on dates for a meeting and had floated the possibility of talks in Vienna or Brussels in the coming days. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said last Monday that he was “reasonably optimistic” talks would happen. However, Iran this weekend sent a note saying it wouldn’t attend a meeting in the current circumstances.</td>

      <td>Some 3,500 miles from Washington, on the African archipelago of Cape Verde, the Justice Department is in a struggle with Venezuela over a U.S. extradition request for Alex Saab.<br />The Colombian-born naturalized Venezuelan works for the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro. The regime calls Mr. Saab a diplomat, but a federal grand jury has indicted him for money laundering. Interpol arrested him in June as his plane was refueling on a trip to Iran.<br />The lengths to which Caracas is going to win Mr. Saab’s release merit attention. It has hired a crack legal team, led by Baltasar Garzón, a controversial Spanish former judge. The U.S. has so far won in court, but the case is on appeal. Mr. Garzón argues that Mr. Saab is not only innocent but protected by diplomatic immunity.<br />It’s doubtful that Venezuela’s herculean effort to defeat the extradition is explained by concerns for the future of the detained Maduro henchman.<br />More likely it’s because, as an intermediary in regime business dealings, Mr. Saab may be intimately familiar with how Venezuelan wealth has been siphoned off to enrich the Maduro nomenklatura. If Mr. Saab finds himself plea-bargaining in America, he may be inclined to share that information with U.S. law enforcement, which might then make it public.</td>

Andrew Cuomo after a second former staffer accused him of misconduct.<br />The latest accuser, Charlotte Bennett, 25 years old, said Saturday that the 63-year-old governor asked her questions about her sex life during an encounter in his Capitol office in June. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said in a statement that he never made any advances toward Ms. Bennett and never intended to make her feel uncomfortable.<br />In accordance with state law, Ms. James asked for an official referral from the governor before beginning an investigation. She also said that Mr. Cuomo’s proposals for reviewing the allegations were unacceptable.<br />The governor said on Saturday that he intended to ask a former federal judge to review Ms. Bennett’s allegations, a move that drew criticism from Democrats and Republicans in the state Legislature. The lawmakers raised concerns over the impartiality of the selection and said a private investigator wouldn’t have the proper powers to conduct a probe.<br />Shortly after Ms. James made her referral request Sunday, a senior adviser to Mr. Cuomo said the governor had asked Ms. James and Janet DiFiore, the chief judge of the state’s Court of Appeals, to select an independent private lawyer without political affiliation to conduct the review.</td>

      <td>We’ve listened to critics and made allowances for their needs and concerns.</td>
      <td>Nasdaq recently submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission focused on diversity of the boards of companies listed on our U.S. exchange. Our proposal establishes a recommended objective for companies to include at least two board members from diverse backgrounds. We asked that each company disclose anonymous aggregate data—self-disclosed by the directors—regarding their gender identity, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation.<br />We provide a runway of two to four years to meet the objective, and we are providing free assistance to our listed companies with a suite of tools and services to help them along the way.<br />We submitted the proposal expecting it to spark debate and discussion. Most important, it is not a quota: the only requirement for companies that don’t meet this new objective is to provide an explanation to shareholders. During the SEC comment period, the vast majority of commenters spoke in favor of our proposal. Some criticized it for not going far enough, and some felt that Nasdaq shouldn’t get involved in boardroom diversity at all.<br />We have listened closely to all the feedback, and we’re making some changes to strengthen our proposal in response. For example, we heard from companies with smaller boards, as well as from several small-cap investors, that meeting the diversity objective would be more challenging for them. As a result of that feedback, we’re now proposing that companies with five or fewer directors may satisfy the recommended objective with one director from a diverse background rather than two. We’re also providing a one-year grace period in the event a vacancy on the board brings a company under the recommended diversity objective.<br />Overall, our proposal seeks to demonstrate that, with proper disclosure and clear objectives, companies and investors can create momentum toward an approach to capitalism that offers more opportunity to more people. We believe this can be accomplished through a market-driven solution—rather than government intervention.</td>

      <td>The clubbiness of the white-shoe law ﬁrms was an outgrowth of a social elitism that sneered at competition as unseemly.</td>
      <td>Well-paid drones who toil into the night as associates in big law firms owe a debt of some kind to William Nelson Cromwell, an early architect of the Wall Street partnership Sullivan & Cromwell. He was fond of saying: “A successful man never forgets his work.” Try telling that to your family on a Saturday night. Then there was Paul Cravath, who pretty much invented the modern law business as an assembly line for Ivy League grads grinding away at minute tasks—in Cravath’s less-than-inspiring words, each “a cog in the machinery of a big law office.”<br />In the late 19th century, law was an industry of idiosyncratic, tiny partnerships. Cravath imposed an organizational rigor. Associates at Cravath, Swaine & Moore labored for eight to 10 years with only a faint hope of making partner but the promise of a golden rainbow for those who did.<br />In “The Anointed: New York’s White-Shoe Law Firms,” Jeremiah D. Lambert and Geoffrey S. Stewart tell the story of three firms—Davis Polk & Wardwell is the third—that came to dominate Wall Street in the early 20th century and established a model that, in many respects, endures today.<br />There was much to admire in the firms’ culture. John W. Davis once chided an associate at Davis Polk for not wearing a hat, then gave him $10 to buy one. In Davis’s day, leading partners were active in philanthropy and bar associations—almost a requirement of their social class—and many did stints in government. After the outbreak of World War I, Paul Cravath was influential in prodding the U.S. to become involved on the side of Britain and France. He saw the Allies’ success as pivotal to American values, and also critical to the interests of a big Cravath client, Bethlehem Steel.<br />Some of these partners showed flashes of enlightened thinking. Cravath, the son of a Congregationalist minister, was chairman of Fisk University, a black college, and expressed concern for the “broad problem of Negro education and race relations.” John Davis was first among 50 New York lawyers, in 1933, to petition the secretary of state to protest Hitler’s purge of Jewish lawyers. Yet as the authors note, such lawyers “rarely considered the hiring practices of their own firms.”</td>

      <td>Democrats and a former CIA chief have criticized President Biden’s decision not to directly punish Saudi Arabia’s crown prince for his alleged role in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.<br />The Biden administration on Friday released a report fingering Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, for the direct role he played in the 2018 assassination of Mr. Khashoggi. The administration sanctioned a top aide to the crown prince as well as the so-called rapid intervention force that played a role in the murder but stopped short of punishing Prince Mohammed, known as MBS, for ordering the operation that led to Mr. Khashoggi’s death.<br />Former CIA Director John Brennan, who served in the Obama administration, suggested the administration limit contact with the crown prince.<br />“Saying that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was responsible for the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi is not holding him accountable,” Mr. Brennan wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “The Biden administration needs to do much more. No meetings with senior U.S. officials and no visits to the U.S. would be a good start.”<br />House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, (D., Calif.), wrote over the weekend that the crown prince “has blood on his hands” and the U.S. “must have accountability.”</td>

      <td>TEL AVIV—Israel will vaccinate Palestinian laborers who work in Israel and in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Israel’s military said Sunday. The move comes as Israel has faced pressure to vaccinate Palestinians who live under Israeli control.<br />The program was approved Sunday by Israel’s political leaders and will begin in the coming days, according to the arm of Israel’s defense ministry that coordinates with the Palestinians.<br />Israel is running the world’s fastest vaccine drive, with over 50% of its population receiving one shot of the vaccine and more than one-third fully inoculated, almost exclusively with the  Pfizer Inc.  vaccine. The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority has been much slower than Israel in organizing a vaccination campaign, and it will mostly rely on the Covax program led by the World Health Organization under which it will receive vaccines for 60% of its population.<br />Israel will establish vaccination sites at crossings between Israel and the West Bank and in industrial zones in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Israeli medical teams will operate the program and will administer  Moderna Inc.  vaccines to those with Israeli work papers. According to a security official, 87,000 Palestinians have permits to work in Israel and 35,000 have permits to work in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank.<br />The military said the effort aims to “maintain public health and the functioning of the economy.”</td>

      <td>The 78th Golden Globes will kick off a very socially distanced 2021 awards season. While award ceremonies have taken on a different look during the pandemic, leaving more room for the unpredictable, there are still some things we can be certain of for the big night this Sunday.<br />The Golden Globes will be airing tomorrow, Sunday, Feb. 28, and begin at 8 p.m. ET. The awards ceremony usually lasts about three hours.<br />The event will be broadcast on NBC and available through the network’s website with a television-provider login. The event will also be available to stream on the Roku Channel, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV, Sling TV and Fubo TV. If you don’t have access to these platforms, many are offering free trials. If you miss the ceremony on Sunday, the event will also be available to watch Monday on NBC’s Peacock service.<br />With more people spending more time at home and movie theaters closed over the last year, there has been no shortage of breakthrough television and films to stream. As a result,  Netflix  is looking at an impressive 42 nominations this year, including Aaron Sorkin’s courtroom drama “The Trial of the Chicago 7.” Another favorite from streaming giant Hulu up for four nominations is Chloé Zhao‘s “Nomadland.” Among the five nominees for best director, three are women including Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) and Regina King (“One Night in Miami”), along with director Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”).<br />Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will be hosting the Golden Globes for the fourth time. However, they will be on different coasts, with Ms. Fey presenting from the Rainbow Room in New York and Ms. Poehler from Beverly Hills, Calif. Guests, nominees and award winners will also be broadcasting live from their respective locations. The comedic duo follows Ricky Gervais, who hosted his fifth Golden Globe awards last year.</td>

While the authors rightly describe the profound implications of the massive surge in M2 from the money that has already been spent, they neglected to mention the implications for the pending $1.9 trillion in Covid spending that President Biden and many at Treasury and the Fed have requested. Follow their logic and understand the profoundly bad implications of an additional $2 trillion on top of the $4 trillion in prior Covid-rationalized spending.<br />The Fed’s creative accounting combined with profligate federal spending won’t end the pain for Americans.

      <td>Many voters came out solely for President Trump, and the down-ballot candidates on the Republican ticket reaped the rewards.</td>
      <td>Your editorial “Trump Lost to Himself” (Feb. 19) ignores many of the facts surrounding the 2020 election and runs contrary to our firm’s postelection polling and analysis. In 2020, President Trump created one of the greatest voter coalitions in American political history, bringing millions of new voters into the Republican Party and expanding the GOP’s vote among African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.<br />The electoral votes that decided the election were determined by a mere 44,000 votes in three states out of a record of almost 160 million ballots cast.<br />President Trump’s record 74 million-plus Republican votes built a solid foundation that down-ballot Republicans benefited from. Many of these voters came out solely for President Trump, and the down-ballot candidates on the Republican ticket reaped the rewards. As our poll indicated, Trump voters supported down-ballot Republicans at least 90% of the time.<br />The president’s popularity among folks who otherwise wouldn’t come out and vote enabled Republicans to gain 12 seats in Congress with zero losses by GOP incumbents. Every House Republican in a tossup race won. A record 35 Republican women won election to Congress. Republicans won 59 of 98 state legislative chambers—a net gain of two state houses and 141 seats across the country.<br />Beltway Republicans need to realize the Republican Party has been changed forever, for the better, because of President Trump’s leadership. As Judge Smails found out in the classic movie “Caddyshack,” the caddies are now running the country club. The GOP must learn to live with it.</td>

      <td>Surveys of faculty opinion show the growing extent of political discrimination and cancel culture.</td>
      <td>Academic freedom is in crisis on American campuses. Last year, the National Association of Scholars recorded 65 instances of professors being disciplined or fired for protected speech, a fivefold increase from the year before. Yet many of academia’s defenders brush aside worries about dismissal campaigns and the lack of ideological diversity as little more than a collection of anecdotes cherry-picked to feed a right-wing moral panic.<br />My new report for the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology gives the lie to these claims. Based on eight comprehensive surveys of academic and graduate-student opinion across the U.S., Canada and Britain, it buttresses the findings of numerous studies to provide hard data on the absence of viewpoint diversity and presence of discrimination against conservative and gender-critical scholars. High-profile activist excesses are mere symptoms of a much wider problem of progressive authoritarianism. Roughly 1 in 3 conservative academics and graduate students has been disciplined or threatened with disciplinary action. A progressive monoculture empowers radical activist staff and students to violate the freedom of political minorities like conservatives or “gender-critical” feminists, who believe in the biological basis of womanhood—all in the name of emotional safety or social justice.<br />Political discrimination is pervasive: 4 in 10 American academics indicated in a survey this summer that they would not hire a known Trump supporter for a job. In Canada, the share is 45%, while in Britain, 1 in 3 academics wouldn’t hire a Brexit supporter. Between one-fifth and half of academics and graduate students are willing to discriminate against right-leaning grant applications, journal submissions and promotion cases. On a four-person panel, this virtually guarantees that a conservative will face discrimination.<br />Meanwhile, only 28% of American academics say they would be comfortable sitting with a gender-critical scholar over lunch, less even than the 41% who would sit with a Trump-voting colleague. Somehow this has become acceptable in a way it never would be for a person from a religious, as opposed to political, minority.<br />Some 75% of American and British conservative academics say their departments offer a hostile climate for their beliefs. Nearly 4 in 10 American centrist faculty concur. This produces a chilling effect that results in self-censorship: I found that merely 9% of Trump-supporting academics say they would feel comfortable expressing their political beliefs to a colleague. Their progressive counterparts admit as much, with only 14% of all U.S. academics saying a Trump supporter would feel comfortable expressing his beliefs. In Britain, only 18% of Brexit-supporting academics would feel comfortable sharing their views, even though 52% of the British electorate supported Brexit.</td>

      <td>To make nuclear bombs, you float a gaseous uranium compound down long distances until molecules with the heavier U-238 isotope fall away, leaving only highly fissionable U-235. That’s why during the Cold War the U.S. flew U-2 spy planes over the Soviet Union to film the ground, so that analysts with lightboards and magnifying glasses could study photos looking for long, narrow buildings. And you thought your job was tedious? We’ve come a long way. But that was a while ago—what’s possible today?<br />To find out, I recently spent some (Zoom) time with Dan Jablonsky, CEO of Maxar Technologies, a Westminster, Colo.-based satellite and imaging company that, as far as I can tell, is the state of the art.<br />Circling every 94 minutes, Maxar’s satellites survey 3.5 million square kilometers of the Earth every day to capture images that are accurate down to a meter and are stored in a massive data set. Each satellite’s camera can be swung up to 50 degrees from overhead. Maxar has 17 years of imaging history. It stores 120 petabytes of data on Amazon’s servers.<br />The military, naturally, is its most important customer. Maxar’s data set and 3-D point clouds can track enemy missile launchers or tanks or anything else, and note changes in case of a threat. Generals then have the option, as Mr. Jablonsky put it with one of my new favorite expressions, to “send kinetic energy down range.”<br />Google Maps is a customer too, using the imagery to help create maps and look for changes—the shops in an average strip mall turn over by 25% every year. Autonomous-vehicle manufacturers will be an emerging market, to map terrain and then to deal with the growing complexity of insurance. Google probably doesn’t want to be liable in an accident, so autonomous car makers may need to purchase their own mapping data.</td>

He still owns about 6% of the company’s shares, according to FactSet.<br />Herbalife is looking to move on from a period in which Mr. Icahn held significant sway over the company—and backed it during challenges from regulators and his rival activist investor William Ackman and the resignation of its CEO. Mr. Icahn became Herbalife’s largest shareholder in 2013, setting up an epic clash with Mr. Ackman, who had bet against the company’s shares and publicly crusaded against its business model.</td>

Ahead of the results of China’s once-a-decade census, there have been several indications that fewer babies were born in the country in 2020 than in any year since 1961, when China suffered mass starvation.<br />A report from Capital Economics this month says it is possible that slowing productivity growth and a shrinking workforce would prevent China from ever overtaking the U.S., or that if it does, the U.S. would regain the top spot again, helped by immigration that keeps refilling its supply of workers.<br />Mark Williams, a London-based economist at Capital Economics, compared it with il sorpasso, Italy’s moment of pride in the late 1980s when it overtook  the U.K., only to drop back again.</td>

The council’s committee on small business will hold a hearing on the bills on Monday.<br />“This legislation will fundamentally reshape the way New York City interacts with small businesses—giving them a chance to survive, save jobs and allowing them to thrive in the future,” said Councilman Mark Gjonaj, a Bronx Democrat who is chairman of the committee and helped draft the bills.<br />One bill, whose lead sponsor is Bronx Democrat Vanessa Gibson, would update more than 180 sanitation, health, noise-control and other code violations on the books at city agencies to provide civil-penalty relief for restaurants, laundromats, pawnshops and other small businesses. This includes lowering existing penalties, letting violators off on warnings for first offenses and allowing “cure periods” for businesses to fix violations and avoid fines.<br />For instance, city Department of Buildings inspectors can now issue $1,250 fines to businesses who illegally display outdoor signs without permits. However, under the bill, operators would get a 30-day grace period to fix the problem and avoid fines.</td>

By combining efforts, the U.S. and its allies can vastly outspend China, whose research-and-development budget now nearly matches the U.S. The alliances can also coordinate policies to deny China the technologies it needs to try to become a global leader.<br />“We have a very strong interest in making sure that the techno-democracies come together more effectively so we are the ones who are doing the shaping of those norms and rules,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken at his confirmation hearing.</td>

The difference is they get the goods upfront. Chains from Macy’s to  Gap Inc.  to Neiman Marcus Group Inc. have introduced buy now, pay later options in recent months to attract younger shoppers, who are less likely to use credit cards.<br />For department stores, the new payment plans risk eating into income from store-branded credit-card fees that have helped offset retail sales declines. Moreover, instead of earning a profit from customers who revolve a balance on their store cards, retailers pay fees to the financial-technology companies that offer buy now, pay later plans, including Klarna Bank AB,  Affirm Holdings Inc.  and  Afterpay Ltd.<br />Retail executives say they hope the benefits of drawing in new customers outweigh the potential costs as they try to rebound from the crippling effects of the pandemic.

The system has been progressively loosened. But it still makes life difficult for new graduates and migrant laborers, particularly in the largest, most cosmopolitan cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.<br />When the nation was younger, poorer and in need of huge investments in housing and infrastructure, that mattered less. But the story is different now: Further sustainable growth depends on funneling workers into the technology, high-end-services and export-oriented industries concentrated in the big coastal and riverine cities as population growth slows sharply.<br />China’s rural population—still enormous at over 550 million in 2019—is significantly older and better off than just a few years ago. City dwellers still make far more money overall, but that advantage has narrowed, in part due to aggressive antipoverty drives under the last two Chinese administrations. Urban disposable incomes, which were over three times the rural average in 2007, now clock in at more like 2½ times. Add in the agricultural land rights rural residents enjoy at home, pricey urban rent, limited access to education and insurance in town—and the relative attractiveness of city life wanes further.</td>

      <td>A recent wave of selling drove up the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which helps set borrowing costs from corporate debt to mortgages, to its highest level since the pandemic began</td>
      <td>February’s government-bond rout has rattled one of the foundations of the past year’s powerful stock-market rally: investor certainty that ultralow long-term interest rates are here to stay.<br />A wave of selling during the past two weeks drove the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which helps set borrowing costs on everything from corporate debt to mortgages, to above 1.5%, its highest level since the pandemic began and up from 0.7% in October.<br />A series of Federal Reserve officials have said the climb is a healthy one, reflecting investors’ improving expectations for a vaccine- and stimulus-fueled economic recovery. Many portfolio managers say they believe rates are likely to flatten out in coming days as yields finally reach what they see as attractive levels. Those views will get a fresh test this week, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell scheduled to make a public appearance Thursday and the release of February’s jobs report Friday.<br />But there are signs, such as unusually soft demand for recent Treasury debt auctions, that selling may not be over and yields may have further to rise. Some traders warn that bond markets are signaling a powerful economic recovery that could upend the dynamics that have held borrowing costs low while powering stocks to records—potentially a recipe for more of the topsy-turvy trading seen over the past week, when the Dow industrials swung more than 1,000 points over three days.<br />“There is a view that recovering from a pandemic looks different than from a normal recession,” said Michael de Pass, global head of U.S. Treasury trading at Citadel Securities.</td>

      <td>Volatility in stock, bond markets this past week indicates inflation concerns are rising</td>
      <td>Here are two things that are both true: A stronger economy is generally good for stocks, and a stronger economy means higher Treasury yields. Students of logic don’t have to progress far in their studies to realize that higher Treasury yields are not, therefore, necessarily good for stocks, and if they missed the class they need do no more than glance at last week’s markets.<br />This past week, bond yields jumped and stocks fell. The trouble was that yields jumped for reasons other than economic optimism, and stocks didn’t like it. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell used his congressional testimony Tuesday and Wednesday to calm the market, but an unusual spike in yields on Thursday took down stocks nonetheless.<br />When yields rise because the economy improves, it shouldn’t hurt stocks (the sheer size of Big Tech raises some doubts this time, but leave that for later). Yes, higher yields reduce the value of companies’ longer-term profits, but a stronger economy means more of those profits in the first place.<br />When yields rise because bondholders are spooked by the size of Treasury auctions, or when upward momentum takes over, or when investors fear a change in approach by the Fed, there’s no offsetting economic improvement to help stocks.<br />What happened this past week seems to be rising concern that the Fed will keep its foot on the accelerator for too long—and will have to hit the economic brakes hard in the future to tamp down inflation.</td>

It uses chauffeur-driven premium or luxury vehicles and offers services such as handling luggage, opening doors for passengers and other amenities.<br />The ride-hailing industry was hit hard by the pandemic when lockdowns brought mass transportation to a halt. Uber and Lyft said last month that ride bookings had halved in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier.<br />The industry has adapted. Uber’s food-delivery service helped it weather the trough in its core offering. Blacklane’s new inner-city service is part of a similar effort, using existing drivers who previously only served the airports to offer the same chauffeured service for rides in the cities where they operate.</td>

That decision may not come until after the midterm elections, in which Mr. Trump intends to play a key role handpicking candidates and punishing Republicans who voted to impeach him.

      <td>Kate Lindsay, a 28-year-old writer in New York, was thrilled when she was offered a staff writer position at Rolling Stone magazine’s website in spring 2019. She was working at a women’s media website that often covered financial advice and salary negotiation.<br />“I felt like if I didn’t negotiate my offer, I’d be failing everything I’ve been taught as a woman,” she says. She emailed the magazine back asking for $10,000 more in base pay. It was the first time she’d ever tried to negotiate.<br />After more than a week’s silence, she says, she was asked to meet with the magazine’s human resources team in person. She says they commented on how she had asked for $10,000 outright instead of “wiggle room,” and told her there was “no room to budge.” She agreed to the original offer, but was told three days later that it had expired. The company gave the job to someone else. Ms. Lindsay felt penalized for her attempt to negotiate. Rolling Stone declined to comment on the negotiation.<br />Many millennials, and especially millennial women, have internalized the notion that you should always negotiate your salary. But, as Ms. Lindsay found, negotiating doesn’t always work—and can occasionally backfire. And now, during the pandemic, many young people are thinking twice about driving a hard bargain in a tough economy.<br />HR experts say the answer isn’t to stop negotiating altogether. Instead, it’s worth considering things beyond your salary, making an extra effort to be collegial and enthusiastic, and realizing that occasionally accepting an offer as presented is fine.</td>

      <td>European consumers are buying electric cars at a faster pace than ever, encouraged by government subsidies and the availability for the first time of models built by their favorite brands.<br />The boom is so strong that Europe passed China as the world’s largest electric-vehicle market last year. Its share of new electric-car sales nearly doubled to 43%, while China and the U.S. lost market share.<br />But Europe’s surge relies heavily on government incentives doled out during the pandemic, and analysts warn the momentum could be reversed if and when that support is withdrawn. Most government EV subsidies are limited in scope and due to expire by the end of this year.<br />“The market is extremely sensitive to government and company discounts,” said Arndt Ellinghorst, auto analyst at Bernstein Research. “Once subsidies are taken away EV sales will collapse by 30-40% at least for one or two quarters.”<br />Without the subsidies, EVs are still considerably more expensive than equivalent combustion-engine vehicles. This isn’t likely to change until later this decade, analysts say, as battery prices come down because of new technology, greater scale and competition.</td>

      <td>The cyberattack that compromised many U.S. government and corporate networks is fueling a debate among big tech companies over what the safest way is for customers to store critical data.<br />It pits Microsoft Corp., which is urging clients to rely on cloud-computing systems, against others including Dell Technologies Inc. and  International Business Machines Corp. , who argue customers want to mix the cloud with the more traditional on-premise data-storage systems in a construct called hybrid-cloud.<br />Government and industry cybersecurity experts for about two months have been trying to unravel details of the incident that is causing a reassessment of long-held networking-security assumptions. The hackers, investigators believe, gained access via networking company SolarWinds Corp. and other avenues of attack.<br />In a House committee hearing about the hack Friday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said in prepared remarks, that “cloud migration is critical to improving security maturity across many organizations.” All of the attacks the company has identified involved on-premise systems, he has previously said.<br />The debate is part of the fallout from the suspected Russia-led hack that Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), on Tuesday said may be in scope and scale “beyond any that we’ve confronted as a nation.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden urged the Senate to take quick action after the House passed his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, as Democrats faced intraparty rifts over the future of a worker-pay increase.<br />The measure passed early Saturday largely along party lines, 219-212, with two Democrats joining all Republicans in opposition.<br />At the White House on Saturday, Mr. Biden said there was “no time to waste” in passing the bill and getting it to his desk, noting that Americans were now closer to receiving more vaccinations, $1,400 relief checks and additional aid contained in the bill.<br />“If we act quickly, decisively and boldly, we can finally get ahead of this virus, we can finally get our economy moving again,” Mr. Biden said. “The people of this country have suffered far too much for too long. We need to relieve that suffering.”<br />Lawmakers will likely alter the legislation before passing it in the Senate, which would send it back to the House to approve the amended bill before it reaches the president’s desk. Democrats are racing to finish the package before March 14, when certain types of federal unemployment assistance are set to expire.</td>

      <td>As dozens of new battery-powered, plug-in car models come to market, roadtrippers who bought anything but a Tesla are discovering that America’s charging infrastructure isn’t ready for prime time</td>
      <td>Bradley Wilkinson is the owner of a 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, and the kind of electric-vehicle diehard who knows how to squeeze every last mile of range out of his vehicle.<br />Even so, during his most recent road trip, from Tampa, Fla., back home to Fort Carson, Colo., he spent about 58 hours on the road. In a gasoline-powered vehicle, on average, the 1,900-mile journey would take about 30. His relatively sluggish pace was due to his need to regularly power up the Bolt’s battery at a “fast” charger—so called because they’re many times faster than typical home chargers.<br />Less experienced EV owners report far bigger inconveniences than Mr. Wilkinson’s. Those include: too few charging stations, too much demand at the stations that are available, broken chargers, confusing payment systems, exorbitant electricity rates, and uncertainty over how long their cars need to charge.<br />While EVs can be powered up at home, industry analysts and academics believe that a fast-charging infrastructure is essential to getting beyond their current limited adoption. This next wave of slightly-less-early adopters is critical to a global automotive industry betting heavily on battery power.<br />Yet so far, only one carmaker has offered a reassuring pitch about conveniently and reliably recharging on the go: Tesla. And Tesla’s fast-charging technology doesn’t work on non-Tesla cars.</td>

      <td>Soups can comfort on many levels. In these recipes, the deftly deployed spices bring heat, nuance, even antioxidants.</td>
      <td>I RECENTLY binge-watched a television series produced in France called “A French Village.” It centers on the fictional community of Villeneuve, near the French-Swiss border, and how the villagers coped during the German occupation in the early 1940s. Food was scarce, but what the characters were able to produce out of little was inspiring. More often than not, it was soup for breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br />I started to count how many times a character sat down to a bowl, took a hungry spoonful, looked up and said, “La soupe, elle est bonne.” I stopped counting somewhere in the fifth season—around the same the time I started cooking more steaming pots of my own. Soup is perhaps the most nourishing, most economical and most satisfying food. Cultures around the world make it. And for good reason. It is as basic as creating a flavor base, adding liquid and vegetables, grains or meat. Or all of the above.<br />I usually start with onions or shallots and garlic, perhaps bacon, pancetta or chorizo, an herb bundle, homemade chicken stock and then whatever’s in the fridge, on the windowsill or in the cupboard. A drizzle of good olive oil, a sprinkling of flaky Maldon sea salt, lots of freshly ground black pepper and a grating of Parmesan will be the finishing touches for a soup I make that skews Italian. A dollop of crème fraîche and a sprinkling of chives top the bowl if I’m leaning French; perhaps a splash of aged Sherry vinegar if I’m simmering something more Spanish.<br />This winter I’ve been gravitating toward turmeric, ginger and other spices said to boost the immune system. So I reached out to Ethan Frisch, co-founder of the fair-trade and sustainable spice company Burlap & Barrel, to get his thoughts on spicing soups. Prior to sourcing spices from Iceland to Guatemala to the Euphrates River, Mr. Frisch was a humanitarian aid worker for Doctors Without Borders on the Syrian-Jordanian border. There and in other remote areas where he volunteered, soups were a mainstay of his diet, and he came to depend upon both local and easily transportable spices to flavor them. Now at home in Queens, N.Y., he has a more sizable pantry, but his technique hasn’t changed. “I might start by tempering cumin in olive oil or butter, add some smoked paprika, cinnamon verum or cinnamon leaves, then some fresh aromatics, celery, carrots, smashed garlic, [and] let them nearly brown before adding broth. Or, if I want to open up my sinuses, I’ll bloom Cobanero chilies, which I love for their fruity smokiness, with some smoked paprika, cinnamon, star anise and black pepper.”<br />Recently, Mr. Frisch launched a Burlap & Barrel series of three masalas created by the late chef and restaurateur Floyd Cardoz. I think of these spice mixes as soup jump starters. They make rather complex and nuanced flavors remarkably easy to pull off. For example, the Goan Masala needs only coconut milk and broth to form a soup both piquant and creamy. The Kashmiri Masala lends a sweet heat, with brightening notes of fennel, ginger and cardamom, as it does in a recipe for Goan pork soup I like to make, adapted from Mr. Cardoz and his wife, Barkha Cardoz. Simply add a bit of stock to moong dal, a classic Indian dish of split mung beans, and you have a rich and protein-packed soup. For a soup with a similarly velvety texture but a more Middle Eastern inflection, infuse lentils with cumin, coriander, mustard seeds and fennel seeds. A topping of crumbled feta and fresh cilantro makes this soup nearly as hearty as a stew.</td>

      <td>After the pandemic killed music tours and their opportunities to sell concert T-shirts and other products, the industry pivoted to streaming. For some artists, that’s only expanded the merch market.</td>
      <td>IN THE SUMMER of 2018, Grace Hall-Ramsay attended a live Harry Styles concert in San Jose, Calif., and had a life-changing experience. The British pop star spotted the 18-year-old in the audience holding a sign that read “I’m Gonna Come Out to My Parents Because of You!” He asked for her mother’s name and—told it was Tina—proceeded to goad a crowd of thousands to yell in unison, “Tina, she’s gay.” The moment understandably went viral. Ms. Hall-Ramsey, an ardent Styler—as the singer’s fans call themselves—had planned to attend 20 Harry Styles concerts in 2020.<br />That didn’t happen. The pandemic brought live music to a halt, but it didn’t wilt Ms. Hall-Ramsey’s fandom. One way she’s maintained a connection to her idol: his increasingly dynamic merch shop. Over the past year, Mr. Styles and his team stoked the momentum following his second album, “Fine Line,” through buzzy music videos and an online shop that released limited-edition capsule collections with the debut of each new video, far exceeding the industry norm (typically, a single merch set is released per major album tour). In quarantine Mr. Styles promoted his album with frequent drops of T-shirts, hoodies, beach towels, prayer candles and other merchandise that alluded to the videos’ themes. “It’s literal [fashion] collections,” said Ms. Hall-Ramsey. “Like, ‘I have to get that, it’s fall/winter.’”<br />Mr. Styles isn’t the only artist redefining the merch formula. Over the past year, many musicians realized that, even if they weren’t touring, their fans would eagerly snap up clothing and other products to commemorate digital moments. These merch opportunities range from music-video drops to intimate live-streamed concerts, album anniversaries to Instagram Live appearances.<br />Dance diva Dua Lipa offered exclusive merch tied to “Studio 2054,” a live-streamed concert that drew over five million viewers in November. The webcast series Verzuz started producing merch to commemorate its once-in-a-lifetime “battles” between R&B and hip-hop notables. Some acts, like rock band the Killers and R&B singer Teyana Taylor have released merch that features tracklists in lieu of the traditional lists of tour dates. Singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright has taken a more DIY approach, upcycling deadstock shirts from past tours to create hybrid T-shirts as souvenirs for live-streamed concerts.<br />In 2019, the last year on record, the global music merch business brought in $3.663 billion in sales revenue, according to Licensing International’s Annual Global Licensing Survey. As tours have vanished, that’s become an internet-first operation. “When all of those things got put on hold or cancelled, [merch] was the only person sitting at the table,” said Edward Aten, the founder of e-commerce platform Merchbar, which works with over 35,000 artists. The realization, he added, “was, like, ‘hey we can do lots of stuff.’”</td>

The awards ceremony usually lasts about three hours.<br />The event will be broadcast on NBC and available through the network’s website with a television-provider login. The event will also be available to stream on the Roku Channel, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV, Sling TV and Fubo TV. If you don’t have access to these platforms, many are offering free trials. If you miss the ceremony on Sunday, the event will also be available to watch Monday on NBC’s Peacock service.<br />With more people spending more time at home and movie theaters closed over the last year, there has been no shortage of breakthrough television and films to stream. As a result,  Netflix  is looking at an impressive 42 nominations this year, including Aaron Sorkin’s courtroom drama “The Trial of the Chicago 7.” Another favorite from streaming giant Hulu up for four nominations is Chloé Zhao‘s “Nomadland.” Among the five nominees for best director, three are women including Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) and Regina King (“One Night in Miami”), along with director Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”).<br />Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will be hosting the Golden Globes for the fourth time. However, they will be on different coasts, with Ms. Fey presenting from the Rainbow Room in New York and Ms. Poehler from Beverly Hills, Calif. Guests, nominees and award winners will also be broadcasting live from their respective locations. The comedic duo follows Ricky Gervais, who hosted his fifth Golden Globe awards last year.</td>

Consisting of satellites, ground-based radar, and air-force bases located mostly in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic, the surveillance system was designed to give the military allies notice of any impending attack from the north.<br />The system, once state-of-the-art, has since become outdated. New missiles being deployed by Russia and China can travel at more than five times the speed of sound and fly much farther than their predecessors, which would overwhelm the existing surveillance network, said Michael Dawson, who served as Canadian political adviser to Norad command in Colorado from 2010 to 2014.<br />In addition, a melting polar ice cap is leaving the once impassable Arctic Ocean ice-free for longer periods of time, creating new vulnerabilities for the U.S. and Canada, current and former military officials say.</td>

Baime.<br />My wife, Debbie, and I have been married for 44 years, and we have been collecting vintage cars and memorabilia all that time. We have probably owned over 200 vintage cars. We collect anything having to do with automobiles: vintage signs, gas pumps, gas station soda machines. One of the things that drew me to the Edsel was this: When you show up at a car show with a Corvette or a Mustang, there are always dozens of others there. When you show up at a car show with 400 cars and you are in an Edsel, yours is probably the only one there.<br />The story of the Edsel is one of the most interesting stories in all of car history.  Ford Motor Co.  built the Edsel to bridge the gap between the base Ford and the luxury Lincoln and Mercury, just like  General Motors  had the Buick and Oldsmobile between Chevrolet and Cadillac. The Edsel was its own brand, and when it rolled out on Sept. 4, 1957, 18 different models were available—the Edsel Ranger, the Pacer, the Corsair, the Citation, etc. [Ford declared the launch date “E-Day,” and marketed the car with an hour-long TV special starring Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong and Bob Hope.]<br /><br /></td>

With tax season under way and extra time at home, it isn’t a bad time to do some spring cleaning.<br />So what should you keep in the filing cabinet, what should you scan and save in the cloud, and what should you just toss in the shredder? I consulted experts in several fields to find out.<br />Tax documents. Individuals only need to keep tax returns and related documents for three years from the date the original return was filed, according to the Internal Revenue Service. There are some exceptions and different periods of limitations for filing refund claims listed here.<br />There are some records you should hold on to even longer, said Andy Phillips, a director at H&R Block’s Tax Institute. For example, if you’ve made improvements to a home you own and rent out, it’s wise to keep records of all repairs and new appliances so you can determine your cost basis when you sell the property.<br />However, you don’t have to keep paper versions of these. Mr. Phillips said it’s fine to produce digital records in the event of an IRS audit.</td>

      <td>The Worcester Art Museum highlights the iconic garment and its influence on three centuries of printmaking.</td>
      <td><br />Worcester, Mass.<br />Claiming the spotlight in the center of a large gallery, the “Worcester Wedding Kimono” captivates the eye with its pattern of large interlocking octagons in a variety of rich reds, spring greens and soft yellows. They are stylized maple leaves, inspired by the local landscape over different seasons—but they were not meant to be the centerpiece of “The Kimono in Print: 300 years of Japanese Design,” which explores the ways fashion and printmaking have intersected in Japan. The kimono, commissioned by and for the Worcester Art Museum, was supposed to have appeared in a concurrent show organized in conjunction with Chiso, a kimono-making workshop in Kyoto in operation since 1555.<br />Covid-19 disrupted that plan, and the museum’s curatorial team deftly adapted. They transformed “Kimono Couture: The Beauty of Chiso” into an online presentation about the history and making of kimonos, each installment pegged to a piece that would have been on display. The final section centers on this garment, the only one to travel here from Japan. In its new venue, surrounded by a selection of some 60 woodblock prints and illustrated books, most from the museum’s permanent collection, the kimono underscores the extent to which these garments act like canvases. Nobody has ever crimped, pleated or ruched their fabric; nobody has ever significantly altered their basic T-cut. All decoration and artistry takes place on their surfaces. In this case, Imai Atsushiro, Chiso’s senior designer, devised the composition, and a team of specialized artisans transferred it onto jacquard silk using five dyeing techniques, embroidery and gold leaf.<br />Immediately striking in the printed depictions of kimonos is the endless variety and interplay of motifs—flowers, fruits, leaves and grasses; clouds, waves, butterflies and phoenixes; checks, stripes, bold zigzags, tiny “fawn dots,” and on and on. Occasionally, a full-fledged artwork fills the back of a kimono, the name the garment acquired in the mid-1800s and that translates simply as “thing to wear.” Kikugawa Eizan’s print from around 1830 depicts the courtesan Yoyoyama swiveling to show off the white-on-black brush painting of bamboo that fills the back of her garment, complete with the artist’s signature seals.</td>

Those are hardly unsurmountable barriers to cross-genre exploration, but except for Brazilian mostly jazz composers like Egberto Gismonti and Hermeto Pascoal, and a few young Americans, like Gyan Riley, who work both sides of the street, the interchange has been sparse.<br />Pat Metheny has taken a bold step to remedy that with “Road to the Sun” (BMG), due out on March 5, with two substantial scores—the six-movement title work, performed here by the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet, and a four-movement solo work, “Four Paths of Light,” played by Jason Vieaux—plus Mr. Metheny’s own arrangement and performance of Arvo Pärt’s “Für Alina.”<br />One of jazz’s most restlessly diverse guitarist-composers, Mr. Metheny has flirted with classical style on occasion, going back to “Unquity Road” (1976) and “Hermitage” (1979), and he made the first recording of Steve Reich’s “Electric Counterpoint” (1987). These two new scores suggest that he has internalized the formal repertory. Both are rich in allusions to the techniques that propel virtuosic works by Francisco Tárrega, Federico Moreno Torroba, Heitor Villa-Lobos and other contributors to the standard canon, but those moves are filtered through Mr. Metheny’s more up-to-date sensibilities, not to mention his own command of the fretboard.<br />Probably the clearest case in point is the finale of “Four Paths of Light.” Though it does not quote Tárrega’s “Recuerdos de la Alhambra” directly, it borrows that work’s main structural device—setting a graceful tremolando melody, on the guitar’s top strings, over an arpeggiated bass figure that outlines the supporting harmonic changes. Though the melody and harmony are Mr. Metheny’s own, it is impossible to hear the new piece without Tárrega’s coming to mind.</td>

      <td>Experts answer readers’ questions about the right technique for push-ups and other exercises.</td>
      <td>We received tremendous feedback from participants in The Wall Street Journal Fitness Challenge, a six-week program developed by Arnie Kander, an NBA sports performance coach. Haven’t signed up yet? You can start at any time here.<br />Mr. Kander uses a 20-second step-up test to provide a baseline for participants to improve upon. For an idea of what it should look like, check out this video. A number of participants wrote asking about proper form and adjustments. Mr. Kander and our expert panel weigh in:<br />The final exercises in the core series are a push-up followed by a plank hold. There are many ways to do a push-up and plank. Can you explain proper technique?<br />The push-up in the program is the standard facing-down movement with good posture of head level to shoulders and pelvis, Mr. Kander says. “Keep this line of posture as you descend into the movement,” he says. “Hands are slightly wider than shoulder width. Let the elbows naturally drift away slightly from the body to activate more of the larger pectoral muscle. Go as low into the movement as comfortable. If it’s been a while since you’ve done a push-up or have shoulder limitations, do not go as low.”<br />After, follow with a high plank, which is the initial starting position of the push-up, he says. Focus on maintaining a straight line from head to shoulders and pelvis and keep your core engaged. “Remember to not hold your breath during these movements,” he says. “You can do the high plank right after the push-ups for more core endurance if your level of fitness is higher, or take a 30-second rest in between,” he says.</td>

      <td>Order blocks Santa Clara County from including churches in ban on indoor gatherings</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court exempted five California churches from a county health directive intended to stem the coronavirus pandemic by prohibiting indoor gatherings.<br />The court’s unsigned order, issued late Friday over the dissent of three liberal justices, blocked Santa Clara County from enforcing the regulation against the churches while litigation continues. It was the latest in a string of orders from the court’s conservative majority directing state and local authorities to curb public-health efforts that restrict indoor religious gatherings.<br />“This outcome is clearly dictated by this Court’s decision in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom,” the court said, referring to its decision earlier this month exempting religious services from California’s statewide regulations that prohibited most indoor gatherings for activities such as political rallies, lectures and performances. The court directed the state to classify religious services along with shopping malls, salons and bus terminals, which were limited to 25% capacity.<br />Santa Clara County, whose measures against the pandemic are among the strictest in California, continued to prohibit indoor gatherings, which it said included “political events, weddings, funerals, worship services, movie showings, cardroom operations.” Other indoor activities, including shopping, were permitted at 20% capacity.<br />The Gateway City Church, in San Jose, and four other churches contested the county’s order as conflicting with the Supreme Court’s directives, but a federal appeals court in San Francisco declined to block the restriction.</td>

The Arctic freeze that hit Texas earlier this month, bringing with it temperatures in the single digits, left millions of homes without power.

      <td>Friday morning’s airstrike against Iran-backed militias in eastern Syria sends a clear message: President Biden will use force to defend American lives. But this welcome development is an exception to the rest of Mr. Biden’s emerging Iran policy.<br />The President authorized the mission Thursday as a response to deadly rocket attacks against American and allied personnel in Iraq this month. The strikes, meant to target the Iranian proxies Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, destroyed several weapons storage facilities.<br />The Pentagon didn’t confirm casualty numbers, but media reports suggest well over a dozen pro-Iranian fighters were killed as the U.S. also struck trucks loaded with weapons. The message will be heard in Tehran and by other U.S. adversaries.<br />On the other hand, there’s Mr. Biden’s seemingly eager desire to return to the flawed 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. After announcing that Washington couldn’t “snap back” United Nations sanctions, the new Administration is consulting with South Korea about releasing at least $1 billion in frozen Iranian assets. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week the U.S. wants to “lengthen and strengthen” the accord—good—but then said President Trump’s sanctions on Iran had failed.<br />How giving up sanctions will get Iran to agree to a better deal is left unsaid. And, no surprise, Tehran has responded to the overtures by curbing access for International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and threatening to further enrich uranium.</td>

      <td>The Biden Administration’s release Friday of a classified report on the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is morally satisfying. Whether it furthers U.S. interests or even human rights in the long run is another question.<br />The report, delivered to Congress in declassified form, puts the onus squarely on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for ordering Khashoggi’s kidnapping and killing. The report doesn’t offer direct evidence of the order; it bases the judgment on the Crown Prince’s control of decision-making in the Kingdom and the involvement of a key adviser and members of his personal security detail.<br />News of the classified report was leaked at the time, in part to embarrass Donald Trump. The former President viewed the Crown Prince known as MBS as an ally and didn’t want to jeopardize Saudi-U.S. ties. He accepted MBS’s denial without nuance or moral condemnation, which was his habit. President Biden is downgrading those ties, or what he calls a “recalibration,” which will play well on Capitol Hill with progressives and isolationists who want to distance the U.S. from the Saudis.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken also announced Friday what he called a “Khashoggi Ban,” a new visa-restriction policy on individuals who “are believed to have been directly engaged in serious, extraterritorial counter-dissident activities.” The U.S. will apply the new ban to 76 Saudis, and it might do some good as a warning to foreign officials that they and their families could be barred from the U.S. if they act against opponents abroad. Don’t underestimate how many foreign leaders want to send their children to Stanford or Duke.<br />But note that the U.S. didn’t apply that sanction to MBS, who is the Saudi defense minister and probably the next King. Democrats and the media are already calling this inadequate and want MBS barred if not indicted. The Biden Administration seems to appreciate that this would lead to a more serious break in U.S.-Saudi relations that would help adversaries in Tehran, Moscow and Beijing.</td>

      <td>New evidence that green policies punish the poor and subsidize the rich.</td>
      <td>The contradictions of green energy policies are becoming more obvious in the real world, and now comes more evidence in a new study of California’s electricity rates. The policies even contradict green climate goals.<br />“California has charted an ambitious course towards decarbonizing its economy,” the study by nonprofit Next 10 and the University of California, Berkeley Energy Institute at Haas declares. “At the same time, California has among the highest electricity prices in the continental U.S. These two facts create a tension: decarbonizing the economy most likely requires electrification of transportation and space and water heating, but high prices push against such a transition. High prices also have troubling implications for equity and affordability.”<br />No kidding. California’s myriad green-energy subsidies and mandates are baked into electric rates, which are now about 80% higher in northern California than the national average and twice as high in San Diego.<br />The state requires renewables like wind and solar to make up 60% of electricity generation by 2030. The study says renewable prices (albeit with subsidies) are now roughly the same as other power sources, but utilities signed long-term contracts with solar and wind producers years ago when prices were higher. Utilities also need backup power when it’s cloudy, which adds costs. Yet the state sometimes has to pay Arizona to take its excess solar power to avoid overloading the grid.<br />And here’s the kicker: Folks with solar panels get paid for surplus power they don’t use—sometimes at two to three times the rate of wholesale power. So California pays the well-to-do to generate solar power it doesn’t need and then pays Arizona to take it.</td>

      <td>At the very least, outright nastiness seems to be a strike against a politician.</td>
      <td>‘Nice guys finish last,” said Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher, whom no one ever called a nice guy. Apparently Durocher was talking about New York Giants manager Mel Ott, whose niceness “Leo the Lip” considered responsible for the Giants’ abysmal 1946 record. But does being nice—decent, generous, kind—really reduce one’s chance for success? Does it do so in politics?<br />One doesn’t often think of the connection between politics and niceness. Disraeli, Gladstone, Churchill, Lincoln, both Roosevelts, Truman—one can find many things to say about each, but niceness isn’t the first word that comes to mind. Some might even view niceness as a detraction in politics. Adlai Stevenson could never drop his modesty while pursuing presidential power.<br />Would anyone cast a vote for political office, from president down to dogcatcher, because a candidate was nice? Perhaps not. Yet in last year’s presidential election, many Americans voted against Donald Trump less because of his policies than because they thought him a braggart, a bully, a buffoon—all things a nice guy isn’t. Had Mr. Trump been less bumptious, had he attempted to establish himself as a more sympathetic figure, would he be beginning his second term as president? Hard to know, but exhibiting a touch or two of niceness surely wouldn’t have hurt his chances.<br />How many of our recent presidents or presidential candidates qualified as nice? Ronald Reagan was less nice than charming, which isn’t the same; charm is about outer attractiveness, niceness about inner thoughtfulness. George H.W. Bush, who tried to sell himself as a Texan, never lost the East Coast WASP in himself that came off as more dignified than nice. Bill Clinton’s claims to niceness were squashed by reports of his sexual predations. Barack Obama came off as nice; he seemed a good father and devoted husband. But he could also be acerbic when challenged. Hillary Clinton might have lost the presidency by too clearly establishing her lack of niceness. How many votes, one wonders, did she lose by calling Mr. Trump’s supporters “deplorables”?<br />The one American president with whom I have had a personal encounter—for a half an hour—is George W. Bush. It took place in the Oval Office in 2003, when I, along with 10 others, received the National Humanities Medal. I didn’t care for the war in Iraq, but as I watched Mr. Bush hand out medals and take photographs with recipients, being especially and genuinely solicitous of the grandchildren a few of them brought along for the occasion, I thought to myself: “This is a nice man.” When Partisan Review editor Edith Kurzweil received her medal, she said to him, “I never believed I’d be in this room.” To which Mr. Bush replied, “Neither did I believe I would.” A nice guy.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump is not the only one who abandoned a prudent reluctance to be caught fibbing.</td>
      <td>Any claim you can imagine can be put into words. That’s why we in journalism don’t put faith in claims. The first and only evidence for a claim sometimes is who’s making it. Citing “two law enforcement officials,” the  New York Times  reported in January that Capitol Hill policeman Brian Sicknick was killed by a fire extinguisher blow to the head. A statement by his family, though, carefully avoided the issue of cause. A ProPublica report offered details that seemed inconsistent with the Times account. A local  CBS  station reported that Mr. Sicknick died of a stroke, citing a named police union official.<br />For all these reasons, I carried an asterisk in my head about the story from day one. Now the New York Times has issued an “update” saying the manner of his death remains unresolved.<br />False versions of events propagated by news reports have probably turned into accepted history more often than we think, but something seems different today. From Donald Trump’s postelection lies to the Democratic Russia collusion hoax, plainly untrue things have assumed a weirdly dominant role in our national life.<br />I partly blame Mr. Trump’s arrival on the political stage but not precisely for the reason you might think. His nonconformity, his brand of unauthorized and idiosyncratic lying, triggered a response from our national elites that amounted to “hooray, now we can lie more recklessly too.”<br />Adam Schiff jumped off a cliff with the collusion hoax. Many reporters jumped with him. There was no blowback. Racial incidents proliferated that seemed to have been invented out of whole cloth. Mr. Trump himself miscalculated that his election lies would be the ultimate proof that there’s no such thing as bad publicity for his brand.</td>

      <td>Newcomers encounter pleasing surprises, troubling flaws—and, not least, the suspicions of previous newcomers.</td>
      <td>Immigrants to America quickly learn that you don’t bargain when shopping. If a fishmonger prices something at $7.50 a pound, you don’t offer to buy it for $4.50, telling him that a fish that’s been dead longer than your grandfather (God rest his soul) can’t be worth what he asks. A fixed price, says Roya Hakakian, can be depressing to immigrants for whom haggling was once “the most satisfying aspect of any shopping experience.” And yet, with its immense and disarming cultural genius, America offers the recent arrival something in lieu of the pleasure (now lost) of being able to beat a vendor down: the right to return a purchased product.<br />In “A Beginner’s Guide to America”—a book written “for the immigrant and the curious”—Ms. Hakakian tells us that many newcomers to America react with disbelief when they learn that stores will take goods back, even days after a sale was made. Being entitled to a refund, she says, is “the surest sign of America’s greatness to them,” proof that “anything is possible because a one-time decision need not be destiny.”<br />This observation takes the seemingly banal into the realm of the profound and is characteristic of Ms. Hakakian’s honest and beautiful book. She describes her text as “part memoir, part reportage, and part a work of imagination,” presenting America to the reader “through the weathered perspective of a naturalized citizen.” Ms. Hakakian arrived in the U.S. in 1985 as a Jewish refugee from Iran, with no English. (She tape-recorded her professors in her first year at Brooklyn College.) More than three decades later, she is a widely published essayist and poet, a Guggenheim fellow, and an assimilated immigrant who wishes above all else to help others assimilate.<br />In the hands of someone less subtle and humane, Ms. Hakakian’s exercise could be seen as presumptuous. Hers is a “guide,” yes, but of an amicable kind. She offers counsel to readers, not commandments, and although her book could be seen as a love letter to America, it is one that’s been written by an exacting lover who isn’t blind to this country’s flaws. Even as she notes how much more accepting of immigrants America is than anywhere else in the world, she attributes some of this tolerance to reforms “forced” upon the nation by “slaves and their descendants.” Elsewhere she calls attention to America’s chronic problem of school shootings. “They may not have had proper books, or benches,” she says of the conditions faced by immigrant children in their countries of origin, “but their teachers did not have to train themselves” to face down a shooter in school corridors and classrooms.<br />But school in America is precisely where the new immigrant also confirms how backward his old country was: There are no textbooks prescribed by the Ministry of Education, and libraries exist to turn children into readers of books. Ms. Hakakian contrasts the open spirit of inquiry in American education with the practice of rote learning in places like Iran. “When you left your country on a student visa to study in America,” she writes—addressing a hypothetical student from abroad—“even you did not realize that you were an educational refugee, a person who had never experienced the thrills of open discussion.” (It will be years, she writes, before immigrants, too, learn of “the shortcomings of this education system.” That insight is proof, however dispiriting, of their assimilation.)</td>

It wasn’t an inspection; the plant manager had asked me to visit.<br />Changes at the facility over the years had made him uneasy. Analog machinery had given way to digital systems, and critical water-treatment processes were now automated. The plant required little human intervention in day-to-day operations. Thanks to remote-access technologies, more maintenance and monitoring activities were being performed off-site by a third party. All this was great for efficiency, especially for his resource-limited operation, but what about the risk? Optimizing for cost and speed meant connecting more digital and networked technologies to his plant floor. Security was no longer simply a matter of gates, guards and guns. It had become a matter of bits and bytes.<br />In early February that plant manager’s unease became another’s reality when someone reportedly tried to poison the water supply in the Gulf Coast city of Oldsmar, Fla. According to the Pinellas County Sheriff, a hacker gained remote access to Oldsmar’s water-treatment-plant network and briefly increased the amount of sodium hydroxide in the water by 100 times—enough to cause death or serious injury to anyone who drank or touched it. Thankfully a technician noticed the anomaly and booted the hacker off the network before any damage was done.<br />What happened in Oldsmar fell just short of the nightmare scenario. The average person is unaware how dependent the country’s critical infrastructure has become on digital technology. At power plants, waterworks and all manner of public utilities, special-purpose computers known as human-machine interfaces connect to ruggedized-process controllers that regulate actuators to spin turbines, rotate robotic arms or, in this case, open valves to release sodium hydroxide.<br />In a perfect world these communications and the operations they command would be walled off from internet-connected systems. But practical demands to monitor operations in real time, glean data analytics from the plant floor and perform remote maintenance have in many cases exposed vulnerable infrastructure to the other side of the firewall. The result is more web-based hacks of operational technology systems. The bad guys get access to critical infrastructure facilities when corporate devices are inadvertently connected to the internet or a network administrator’s credentials are stolen in a spear-phishing scam.</td>

      <td>From Mill to Marx and on to Keynes, a history of misdiagnosis.</td>
      <td>‘Prophecies about the end of capitalism . . . have dotted the history of modern social science since its inception,” Francesco Boldizzoni observes in “Foretelling the End of Capitalism: Intellectual Misadventures Since Karl Marx” (Harvard, 326 pages, $35). “Almost all of the great social theorists, at one point or another in life, engaged in forecasting.” I am inclined to look favorably on any book purporting to expose the follies of revered intellectuals, and the prospect of a history chronicling end-of-capitalism predictions filled me with anticipation.<br />Mr. Boldizzoni was of course under no obligation to write the book I was hoping he had written, and he has not done so. He accepts his prognosticators’ premise that capitalism is basically a malign system that exacerbates inequality and “turns culture into business and . . . enslaves minds to its logic.” Moreover his explanations for the failure of predictions by Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, Max Weber and John Maynard Keynes, among others, strike this reviewer as hopelessly abstruse and heavily reliant on the economic theories that lured these intellectuals into making foolish predictions in the first place.<br />The abrasiveness of the book’s title, together with the author’s highly self-assured tone, led me to expect a bit more in the way of demolition. Mr. Boldizzoni treats his subjects and their “misadventures” with ample deference. He gently concedes, for example, that Marx’s labor theory of value—the theory that a product or service’s value is determined by the labor required to produce it —was wrong. That’s a pretty important thing to be wrong about for a man whose economic theories dominated half the globe for a century, is it not? Mr. Boldizzoni brushes the problem aside, since it “does not disprove the claim that exploitation and the appropriation of surplus value underlie the wage-labor relation.” It doesn’t disprove a lot of things, but it does prove that Marx was a poor judge of economics and human relations.<br />So reluctant is he to confront the hubris of his subjects’ theories that Mr. Boldizzoni, a professor of political science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, actually does precisely what he criticizes them for doing: He predicts the end of capitalism. “Capitalism will indeed end sooner or later,” he writes, without the slightest sense of irony. He can draw this conclusion, he reasons, because “capitalism is a historically bound formation just like the economic and social systems that preceded it in antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the early modern period.”<br />Is it, though? Mr. Boldizzoni, like almost all writers on the left and some on the right, writes of capitalism as a “system,” sometimes even assigning agency to it, as if it were designed by some nefarious force. It’s never clear what he means by the term. What if the thing intellectuals call capitalism is nothing more than the freedom and order necessary to borrow money for the purpose of advancing money-making enterprises? That state of affairs is not a constant in human history, but neither is it confined to the modern era, and it will not vanish as long as humans populate the planet.</td>

      <td>The former U.S. Olympic gymnastics coach, who died by suicide on Thursday, was once lauded, and then criminally charged, for his treatment of athletes.</td>
      <td>John Geddert, by his own description, was a hard-driving gymnastics coach. A towering figure in the Michigan gymnastics world, he prided himself on his high standards and intensity, and pointed to his gymnasts’ successes as proof of his work.<br />In two dozen felony charges against Geddert unveiled on Thursday, however,  the Michigan attorney general said that Geddert’s brand of coaching was a form of forced child labor. Prosecutors said he physically harmed young athletes through his training methods and terrorized them into performing through injury, for his own profit.<br />Two hours later, Geddert was found dead in a rest area off an interstate highway, ending his transformation in the public eye from the winningest coach in the state to a bully who had enabled his friend Larry Nassar to sexually assault women and girls over three decades.<br />Geddert’s apparent suicide devastated people who hoped to hear Geddert answer to the allegations against him, which also included two sexual assault charges in which he was accused of digitally penetrating a girl between the ages of 13 and 16. His death raised questions about why the charges had been revealed before Geddert was in custody.<br />It also dashed hopes that Geddert would resolve lingering mysteries around Nassar. And the charges against him showed how some types of coaching are now being viewed as a form of child abuse that can also create an environment conducive to sexual assault.</td>

      <td>The 78th Golden Globes will kick off a very socially distanced 2021 awards season. While award ceremonies have taken on a different look during the pandemic, leaving more room for the unpredictable, there are still some things we can be certain of for the big night this Sunday.<br />The Golden Globes will be airing on Sunday, Feb. 28 and begin at 8 p.m. ET. The awards ceremony usually lasts about three hours.<br />The event will be broadcast on NBC and available through the network’s website with a television-provider login. The event will also be available to stream on the Roku Channel, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV, Sling TV and Fubo TV. If you don’t have access to these platforms, many are offering free trials. If you miss the ceremony on Sunday, the event will also be available to watch Monday on NBC’s Peacock service.<br />With more people spending more time at home and movie theaters closed over the last year, there has been no shortage of breakthrough television and films to stream. As a result,  Netflix  is looking at an impressive 42 nominations this year, including Aaron Sorkin’s courtroom drama “The Trial of the Chicago 7.” Another favorite from streaming giant Hulu up for four nominations is Chloé Zhao‘s “Nomadland.” Among the five nominees for best director, three are women including Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) and Regina King (“One Night in Miami”), along with director Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”).<br />Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will be hosting the Golden Globes for the fourth time. However, they will be on different coasts, with Ms. Fey presenting from the Rainbow Room in New York and Ms. Poehler from Beverly Hills, Calif. Guests, nominees and award winners will also be broadcasting live from their respective locations. The comedic duo follows Ricky Gervais, who hosted his fifth Golden Globe awards last year.</td>

      <td>It’s high drama at the Golden Globes this year.<br />The awards show that is supposed to be a little raucous—the frat party on the way to the Oscars—already had a reputation for contentious wins and snubs. But going into Sunday night’s ceremony, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, whose small membership votes on the awards, is facing more serious questions about the diversity of its ranks and the ethics of its prizes.<br />As if all that weren’t challenging enough, the largely virtual telecast must draw viewers without its usual ballroom of movie stars, all during a pandemic, which even on a good day doesn’t leave many people in the mood to pop champagne. The NBC show, co-hosted by Amy Poehler in Beverly Hills and Tina Fey in New York, airs at 8 p.m. Eastern/5 p.m. Pacific.<br />In an alternate universe, the Globes might have finally gotten more respect this year. As the only major award that honors film and TV, the trophies could have looked more relevant than ever, reflecting how viewers in the streaming era are blending their entertainment on small screens at home.<br />“They’ve done an excellent job in making themselves important,” said Hawk Koch, a film producer and former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars. Recent controversies may take a toll, he said, but the Globes remain influential. “People take it kind of half seriously—it’s good for everybody in the industry because it gives us more exposure.”</td>

      <td>The run-up in  GameStop Corp.’s  share price this week is adding pressure on the company to deliver a turnaround that can be embraced by more than meme-stock believers.<br />But a digital transformation for the brick-and-mortar-centric retailer may be tough to execute, analysts say, in part because the game-download market is dominated by console makers  Microsoft Corp.  and  Sony Corp.  Additionally, the world’s largest tech firms have flocked to cloud gaming, while in-game spending has grown in recent years to contribute the biggest share of the industry’s revenue.<br />GameStop’s stock skyrocketed in value last month when an online community successfully encouraged hordes of people to buy shares in it and other heavily shorted public companies. Though GameStop’s share price has since fallen dramatically after cresting at $483, it has remained volatile. Friday, shares traded around $110 apiece, more than double last Friday’s close of nearly $41.<br />A yearslong slide in revenue, executive turnover and strategic missteps have all hurt the Fortune 500 company’s competitive standing. Two years ago, GameStop failed to sell itself and then pledged to become more relevant in an industry that was years into a digital transition.<br />One of its largest shareholders and newest board members, Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen, is pushing to overhaul the business. GameStop Chief Executive Officer George Sherman has said the company aims to be the “leading” retailer across digital and physical channels for all things gaming and entertainment.</td>

      <td>The world’s largest chain of cinemas found some unlikely allies in its quest to stay afloat through the pandemic</td>
      <td>A frenzied rally that began with videogame retailer  GameStop Corp.  boosted the fortunes of the world’s largest movie theater chain, aiding  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  in its yearlong quest to survive the pandemic. No one was more surprised by the turn of events than AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron.<br />“I was completely oblivious to GameStop,” Mr. Aron said. “I had never heard of them.”<br />In late January a group of renegade individual investors banding together on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets turned their attention to AMC following their successful campaign to pump up the stock of GameStop. For AMC, the attention was far-fetched even for a company that depends on fictional Hollywood story lines to lure people into its theaters. It wasn’t so long ago that a bankruptcy filing loomed as its likely finale.<br />In the span of 72 hours, AMC’s stock soared 467%. The hashtag #SaveAMC proliferated on social media, attached to memes showing images of AMC theaters superimposed on the surface of the moon—a symbol that Reddit traders use to represent their aspirations of the stock reaching stratosphere-busting heights. The mania helped AMC bag another $305 million from the stock market and slash its debt load by $600 million. After dipping back down to as low as $5.35 following the January peak, AMC shares rose again this week amid a new burst of meme-heavy social media attention. The stock climbed 41% through Friday, closing at $8.01.<br />What happened to AMC is a testament to a new force in financial markets: small-time investors whose collective power, often fueled by social media hype, can help determine a company’s fate.</td>

On Friday, her first full day on the job, Mr. Biden visited Texas to talk with local leaders about an Arctic chill that brought the state’s grid near a catastrophic collapse.<br />Ms. Granholm pointed to Texas and blackouts last year in California that she said illustrate how the U.S. electricity system struggles with increasing demand and extreme weather. In one of her first interviews since winning Senate confirmation Thursday, she also said that the demands of the modern economy—envisioned by the Biden team as running on low-emissions technologies—will require federal support for the energy sector.<br />“If we’re going to add the gigawatts of clean energy to the grid that we need to in order to do electric vehicles, in order to accommodate all of the data centers that are being added, we have got to invest…and harden the grid,” Ms. Granholm said, referring to the growth of the internet industry and cloud computing.<br />Ms. Granholm said one of her top priorities is to use the department’s loan program to jumpstart her work. The program offering federal loans and loan guarantees to start-ups and energy projects has $40 billion authorized by Congress but untouched by the Trump administration. That can be funneled into companies bringing new energy technologies to market, especially for power units, battery storage and grid improvements, among others.</td>

The 10-year yield rose more than 0.3% in February for the largest one-month rise since November 2016.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed sharply on Thursday as a weekslong selloff intensified—fueled by bets that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates earlier than previously expected in response to what investors widely expect to be a burst of economic growth and inflation later this year.<br />The 10-year yield logged its largest one-day gain since Nov. 9 during Thursday’s session to finish at its highest closing level in a year. The five-year yield, which is more sensitive to the near-term outlook for interest rates, experienced its largest one-day gain in more than 10 years.<br />Higher yields, though, helped investors regain their appetite for Treasurys on Friday. Demand was also boosted by it being the last trading session of the month, when many fund managers buy Treasurys to match the adjustments in their benchmark bond indexes.</td>

John Milton argued for truth: “Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter?” The answer to that question is this: Truth has nothing to fear from error in a free exchange of ideas, and therein lies the challenge we face in our current reality. In today’s world there is little opportunity for such a free exchange of ideas, whether in the academy, social media or even in the formation of government policy.

They saw the doctrine as the only legal bulwark protecting the president against savage attacks from the three major networks. With all the controversy, President Reagan asked for a briefing. With a group of hostile advisers looking on, I explained that the plain language of the First Amendment meant that the press that used air and electrons must be as free as the press that used paper and ink. The president listened intently. A key adviser spoke up. With stiff opposition from his conservative base, at the least, he warned, Reagan should stay out of the fight.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration plans to allow a sweeping Trump-era rule aimed at combating Chinese technology threats to take effect next month, over objections from U.S. businesses, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The rule, initially proposed in November, enables the Commerce Department to ban technology-related business transactions that it determines pose a national-security threat, part of an effort to secure U.S. supply chains. Companies in technology, telecommunications, finance and other industries say the rule could stifle innovation and hurt competitiveness, and had expected it to be delayed as the administration undertakes a broad review of U.S. policy on Chinese technology.<br />Now the administration is planning to go forward with the rule, the people said. Administration officials are concerned that blocking or diluting the rule would send the wrong message about the new administration’s approach to China, potentially fueling criticism that it is taking a weaker approach, according to the people.<br />One person familiar with the matter said administration officials have signaled to the business community that they won’t enforce the rule aggressively. That could soften the impact, although business representatives say the rule will still subject firms—especially smaller ones—to significant new compliance costs and uncertainty. Another person familiar with the matter said the administration hasn’t said it would hold back in enforcing the rule.<br />The rule is “unworkable for U.S. businesses in its current form and should not be considered for final publication without significant revisions,” said the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs of major companies from Amazon.com Inc. and Citigroup Inc. to Walmart Inc., in a comment filed with the Commerce Department in January. International Business Machines Corp. said the rule as written was “massively overbroad” and would harm the economy while failing to enhance U.S. national security.</td>

      <td>U.S. officials based their assessment of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on his control of decision-making in the kingdom and the direct involvement of members of his protective detail</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the operation to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi that resulted in his death in 2018, a U.S. intelligence report says.<br />In response, the U.S. is preparing to levy sanctions against a group of Saudis implicated in the killing, though not Prince Mohammed himself, a senior U.S. official said.<br />The public release of the report and the measures to punish those involved in the killing are the latest step in President Biden’s “recalibration” of ties with Saudi Arabia, which includes pressing Riyadh to help end a devastating civil war in Yemen and improve its human rights record while maintaining strategic cooperation.<br />The report publicly implicates the de facto head of state of a major strategic ally in a homicide. But none of the U.S. penalties will target Prince Mohammed directly, nor has the U.S. threatened broader measures such as a trade embargo or a withdrawal of support in Saudi Arabia’s proxy conflict with Iran or its role in the Yemen civil war. A senior administration official said the U.S. is eager to avoid a rupture of relations, but “we’ve also made clear that this administration will not sweep anything under the rug.”<br />The senior official, speaking before the report’s release, said the Biden administration values the 75-year strategic partnership with the oil-rich kingdom but “the reality here in the United States and in Washington is that the Saudis have just lost both political parties, support of the American people.”</td>

The answer is yes. Consider when the atom was split. It was followed by the end of the Second World War and a new source of clean energy, not more destructive wars as predicted. That’s mainly because we have learned ways to make those infamous slippery slopes less slippery.</td>

      <td>House prepares to pass its version of the bill after setback on wage issue from Senate parliamentarian</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats tried to salvage a worker-pay increase after the existing minimum wage proposal was ruled out of bounds in the Senate, exploring a major change to the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 aid package as the House prepared to pass its version of the bill.<br />House passage of the relief plan, expected later Friday, will send the legislation to the Senate, where lawmakers will alter it. The House will then need to approve the amended bill before sending it to President Biden’s desk. Democrats are racing to finish the package before March 14, when certain types of federal unemployment assistance are set to expire.<br />The relief plan would enhance and extend federal unemployment benefits, provide $350 billion to state and local governments, send a $1,400 check to many Americans and fund vaccine distribution, among other measures. Republicans have largely lined up against the legislation, attacking it as too large and wasteful, in particular its provisions for school funding and state and local governments, as the economy shows signs of recovery.<br />The minimum-wage effort, which would raise the rate to $15 an hour by 2025, was thrown into doubt after a ruling from the Senate parliamentarian late Thursday effectively barred Democrats from including the measure as part of the plan. The nonpartisan parliamentarian said that raising the minimum wage wouldn’t comply with the body’s rules for legislation passed through a process called reconciliation, which allows a bill to be approved with 51 votes but requires that it be closely tied to the budget.<br />The finding created a political stress test for Democrats, who have largely remained united in the early weeks of Mr. Biden’s term.</td>

      <td>Growing up in India, Vandi Verma admired Spock on ‘Star Trek’ and wanted to be an engineer. Now she drives the NASA rover exploring the red planet.</td>
      <td>There’s some confusion about the time at which Vandi Verma and I are supposed to connect on Zoom. She’s in Pasadena, Calif., and I’m in New York. I assume there’s been an Eastern vs. Pacific clock-mix-up, but Ms. Verma doesn’t think about time “that way.” Instead, she says, “I usually check whether somebody’s talking about Earth time or Mars time.”<br />Ms. Verma has good reason to pay heed to the time on Mars, currently 134 million miles away. She’s the chief engineer of robotic operations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Perseverance rover, which landed on Mars on Feb. 18. The sight of NASA scientists cheering the successful descent from their control room at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory lifted American hearts. But there were “many fewer people in the room,” she tells me, than when the last rover, Curiosity, reached the red planet in 2012: “There had to be distancing this time because of the pandemic. So there were people in other rooms, and others observing remotely.”<br />Ms. Verma and her team are responsible for “everything to do with the mobility of the rover,” which includes driving and navigation as well as operating the robotic arm that gathers rock and core samples on Mars. They also oversee the Ingenuity helicopter, a small, autonomous rotorcraft that weighs 4 pounds and spans 4 feet. “This will,” she tells me, “be the first aircraft to attempt powered, controlled flight on another planet.”<br />Ms. Verma does some of the driving of Perseverance herself, often remotely from home thanks to Covid. Her 18-month-old twins, Arjun and Anya, are usually home, so they’re often on Mars time, too, “although it’s sometimes hard to manage them.” Fortunately, her husband, a systems engineer at JPL, is on hand to help. Ms. Verma thinks she has it easy. Some colleagues have more-taxing “Earth-time counterparts in their life”—significant others and older children who have a hard time coexisting on cross-planetary clocks.<br />A Mars day, called a sol, is 40 minutes longer than an Earth day, so the time difference changes every day. “You try to get synchronized with Mars, instead of Earth,” Ms. Verma says. “So we’ll eat breakfast at 10 p.m. if that’s when it’s breakfast time on Mars, and dinner at 5 a.m. if it’s night there.” She tries to avoid “Earth light when it isn’t daytime on Mars, because it helps a lot with your circadian rhythm.” Ms. Verma has been driving Mars rovers since 2008, so she has some advice for rookies: “No matter how dark your curtains are, they aren’t ever dark enough to keep the light out. So it helps to put tinfoil on the windows, to completely block the light.”</td>

      <td>Nostalgia can bring comfort and meaning, even inspiration. It’s about the future more than the past.</td>
      <td>Nostalgia has a bad reputation. Some people view it as unhealthy, a mental weakness signifying fear of change and progress. Many see it as a form of escapism, a feeling that people enjoy because it takes them away from reality and back to their youth. I’ve even heard it argued that nostalgia is bad for business, as companies need to focus on the present and prepare for the future, not dwell on the past.<br />A growing body of research indicates that all these intuitions about nostalgia are wrong. Reflecting nostalgically on the past is a common and healthy experience that helps people find the inspiration and confidence needed to move forward in life, particularly during difficult times. I would go so far as to say that nostalgia is about the future more than the past.<br />The term was coined in 1688 by Swiss physician Johannes Hofer to capture what was believed to be a medical condition mostly confined to Swiss mercenaries longing for their mountain home while fighting wars in the lowlands of Europe. Symptoms included deep sadness, bouts of weeping, fainting, stomach pain, disordered eating, fever, heart palpitations and suicidal thoughts. This medical-disease framing persisted through the 18th and 19th centuries, though diagnoses expanded beyond the Swiss. With the arrival of the 20th century, nostalgia was no longer treated as a physical disease but began to be thought of as a psychological ailment with symptoms we might associate today with anxiety and depression.<br />Later in the 20th century, some scholars began to see nostalgia in a more sympathetic light, distinguished from the more unpleasant state of homesickness. Consumer psychologists and marketing researchers documented ways in which sentimentality toward the past predicted product preference and consumer decisions. But we hadn’t yet conducted the systematic studies needed truly to understand nostalgia. This changed in the first decade of this new century when researchers, including my team, approached the study of nostalgia using the modern tools of behavioral science.<br />We observed that nostalgia doesn’t cause distress. Instead, distress causes nostalgia. External cues such as running into an old friend, seeing an old photo on  Facebook ,  or hearing music from one’s youth can trigger nostalgia, but when it comes to internal psychological triggers, people tend to experience nostalgia in response to feeling sad, lonely, meaningless and uncertain about where they are in life.</td>

Founders could save money on rent and hire employees wherever they want to live.<br />Going cloud-only may not be for all companies. Even in the software sector, where the work doesn’t generally involve designing and building tangible objects, there are a host of challenges to dispensing entirely with offices. These range from learning the communication habits of colleagues who never met in person to fostering the kinds of relationships it takes to fundraise from afar. Decades of research point to the power of proximity, augmenting the lore around Silicon Valley, and the birth of the world’s most successful companies.<br />But some startup founders, like Alan d’Escragnolle, aren’t struggling with trade-offs and are finding the benefits of remote work worth it: He said his team brainstorms just as well remotely and that employee productivity hasn’t suffered.<br />A year ago, Mr. d’Escragnolle was set to join his co-founder at Filmhub, an online film-distribution startup, in Los Angeles to sign an office lease and start hiring. Instead, he ended up renting a ski house in Lake Tahoe, and has been running the company from there since March.</td>

      <td>Erik Satie’s ‘Gymnopédies,’ all composed in 1888, have had an impact on the music of the 20th century and today that belies their modest scale</td>
      <td><br />Even amid the tornado of cultural experimentation that defined La Belle Epoque—those four fertile decades in France that preceded World War I—Erik Satie (1866-1925) was a singularly windy eccentric. He declared himself not a musician but a “phonometographer.” He was almost a parody of a bohemian, strolling Paris streets in his frock coat and hat, his beard unkempt and his hair long. Living alone in shabby conditions, working intermittently as a pianist in cafes in the early 1890s, collecting umbrellas, Satie had made good on his college teacher’s designation of him as “the laziest student at the Conservatoire.”<br />Yet this notoriously idiosyncratic figure had already composed three short pieces that remain among the most popular, influential and lovely piano works produced in the 19th century. Their name is characteristically bizarre: the “Gymnopédies,” derived from the Gymnopaedia—the festival where naked young men in ancient Sparta participated in war dancing. The title is deceptively complicated; the “Gymnopédies” are austere works.<br />Though all three pieces were composed in 1888, when he was still in his early 20s, Satie published the “Gymnopédies” separately over the next seven years. They were first performed separately at the Chat Noir in Montmartre, a cabaret where Satie became a pianist. The only available evidence of their reception comes from the newsletter of the Chat Noir: “We cannot recommend this essentially artistic work highly enough to the musical public,” it read. “It may rightly be considered as one of the most beautiful of the century that has witnessed the birth of this unfortunate gentleman.” Satie almost certainly wrote that notice himself.<br />At the time he composed the “Gymnopédies,” French music was still huddling defensively in the enormous shadow of Wagner’s operas. The German Romantic had died five years earlier, but even from the grave he would influence the French music scene for the next 20 years or more. With its stripped-down plainness, Satie’s suite was as contrary to the German composer’s grandiose symphonies as it was possible to be.</td>

      <td>Movie-theater chain has stayed out of the meme-stock spotlight that has glared on rival AMC</td>
      <td>Among U.S- based movie-theater chains,  AMC Entertainment  has definitely provided more entertainment of late. But Cinemark’s comparatively boring show might be more worth tuning in to.<br />Texas-based Cinemark has been overshadowed by the attention investors have focused on its competitor. Next to  GameStop ,  AMC has become perhaps the second hottest in a crowd of so-called “meme stocks” favored by the WallStreetBets crowd on Reddit. Before Cinemark’s fourth-quarter results Friday morning, AMC shares were up 291% so far this year compared with about 31% for Cinemark.<br />AMC’s weaker financial footing seemed to be a draw for the risk-addicted YOLO crowd, who saw the company as teetering on bankruptcy and as a possible investment or buyout target by a bigger Hollywood player. Cinemark by contrast has long been considered the most financially stable of the major theater chains. Michael Pachter of Wedbush wrote to clients earlier this week that he expects Cinemark “to come out of the pandemic relatively unscathed.” Of AMC, he predicted, “it will be years before AMC is able to revisit its prior growth strategy as it repays its growing mountain of debt.”<br />Cinemark’s fourth-quarter revenue plunged 88% from a year earlier to $98.2 million, and attendance was about 10% of the prior year’s comparable period. The company said it burned about $65 million in cash a month during the quarter. Still, revenue well exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, thanks in part to some innovative moves such as private watch parties, where families or other small groups rent a full auditorium for $99. These accounted for 24% of U.S. admissions revenue for the quarter. The company also says its “cash runway” extends into the fourth quarter, and even into 2022 including the tax refunds it expects to receive.<br />Cinemark has good reason to be more upbeat since its last report on Nov. 5, which came just days before news of the first major coronavirus vaccine breakthrough. A growing pace of vaccinations and plunging infection rates is allowing New York theaters to start reopening March 5, and Cinemark Chief Executive Mark Zoradi said Friday he expects the key markets of Los Angeles and San Francisco to begin reopening “in the coming weeks.”</td>

      <td>ORLANDO, Fla.—The high-profile split among Republican officials in Washington over Donald Trump isn’t on display here, as thousands of conservatives have flocked to CPAC to hear from the former president and some of his staunchest political disciples.<br />This year’s annual Conservative Political Action Conference got under way in earnest inside a hotel ballroom Friday morning, when hundreds of conservatives were welcomed by video recordings that repeated Mr. Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Trump’s image is splashed all over this year’s conference, where MAGA paraphernalia is abundant.<br />“We have a party led by Donald J. Trump,” said Ohio Senate candidate Josh Mandel, who criticized “squishy Republican governors” who had implemented widespread restrictions to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Mandel, one of many Trump-aligned candidates who have announced campaign bids in recent weeks, called himself “pro-gun, pro-life, pro-Trump.”<br />Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, touted his keep-the-economy-open approach to Covid-19, championed by Mr. Trump during his time in office. The annual CPAC event is typically hosted near Washington but relocated to Florida, where state Covid-19 restrictions allow for mass gatherings like CPAC to occur indoors, something Mr. DeSantis and others applauded Friday. CPAC organizers have limited the number of attendees because of Covid; in the past, more than 10,000 people have attended. The event is also being streamed online.<br />The governor also cited a need for strict enforcement of immigration law, including the border wall advocated by Mr. Trump, to curb the flow of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. “We cannot—we will not—go back to the days of the failed Republican establishment of yesteryear,” Mr. DeSantis said.</td>
