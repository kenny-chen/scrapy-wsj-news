      <td>BEIJING—China’s consumer prices slipped into deflationary territory last month in year-over-year terms, while the country’s factory-gate prices began to reflate after 11 straight months of decline.<br />China’s producer-price index returned to inflation at the start of the year by rising 0.3% in January from a year earlier, compared with a 0.4% fall year-over-year in December.<br />Chinese producer prices began falling a year ago as the coronavirus pandemic ravaged first the domestic economy and then other parts of the world. Demand and production in the industrial sector were both weighed down, hitting commodity prices.<br />Now, driven by improved domestic demand and rising prices for crude oil, iron ore and other raw materials, Chinese producer prices rose 1.0% in January compared with a month earlier, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday.<br />With industrial production and demand continuing to improve, China’s producer-price index will likely remain in positive territory for the rest of the year, said Zhang Ning, an economist at UBS.</td>

      <td>Fears of suppression grow, given the military’s history of deadly violence against pro-democracy demonstrations</td>
      <td>Protesters in Myanmar poured into the streets for the fifth straight day Wednesday to oppose last week’s military coup, despite an escalating use of force by authorities.<br />A day earlier, police fired gunshots to disperse protesters, and used rubber bullets and water cannons, causing injuries and raising fears of harsher suppression. The United Nations expressed strong concern over Tuesday’s police action, saying the use of disproportionate force was unacceptable, and the U.S. condemned violence against demonstrators.<br />Tens of thousands of people have participated in street rallies and marches against the Feb. 1 takeover. The coup ended a democratic shift in the country that began a decade ago and abruptly put Myanmar back into the hands of the military, which has ruled it for much of the past seven decades since independence from British colonial rule. In past years of army domination, security forces relied on arrests, batons, militias and guns to put down pro-democracy uprisings.<br />Protesters are demanding that the military release hugely popular civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whom they detained as her government was deposed, and hand back power. In a speech Monday night, the leader of the coup, military chief Min Aung Hlaing, promised to build a “genuine and disciplined democratic system.” New elections would be held, he said, though it isn’t known what the terms of any such vote would be.<br />Signs that authorities might use greater force to suppress protests have been growing since Monday. As demonstrations surged in towns and cities throughout Myanmar, an ominous message appeared on state television, saying action would be taken against those who were disturbing the country’s stability and that lawbreakers shouldn’t be tolerated. Later, authorities effectively banned protests in parts of the country’s two largest cities, Yangon and Mandalay.</td>

They have more than doubled in the past 12 months, gaining more than 30% since the start of 2021.<br />The rally has turned the liquor company into one of the world’s most valuable consumer-goods companies, outstripping giants such as  Procter & Gamble Co. ,  Nestlé SA  and  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE .<br />It is now roughly as important to the Chinese market as  Apple Inc.  is in the U.S., accounting for 7.3% of the Shanghai Composite Index while Apple makes up about 6.7% of the S&P 500. China’s biggest technology companies,  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., aren’t listed on the mainland.<br />Shanghai-listed Moutai makes an unlikely bedfellow for these Western blue chips. The company is majority owned by the local government in the southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou and its chairman, Gao Weidong, was the regional government’s top transport official before assuming his post last year. The best-compensated executive listed in its 2019 annual report received the equivalent of about $130,500.</td>

This week, private-equity firms Bain Capital LLC and Cinven Group Ltd. struck a $4.7 billion deal to acquire the specialty-ingredients business of Swiss life-sciences company  Lonza Group AG . That followed Friday’s $4.7 billion agreement for a  Blackstone Group Inc.  and Global Infrastructure Partners-led group to buy the U.K.’s  Signature Aviation  PLC, the world’s largest operator of private-jet bases.<br />So far this year, private-equity firms have generated 29% of global deal activity, measured by value, up from 24% in the year-earlier period, according to Dealogic, a data provider.<br />Advent, which oversees $66 billion in assets, is seeking a buyer for Laird’s performance-materials business, which develops products to protect and improve the performance of automotive components, consumer electronics and next-generation 5G  wireless telecom  networks. Carriers in the U.S. and elsewhere are spending billions of dollars on airwave frequencies and equipment to build out 5G networks as consumers seek faster speeds to download movies and other services.<br />Laird, which traces its roots back nearly 200 years from its beginnings in Liverpool servicing the shipping industry, also owns two smaller businesses. One is focused on wireless connectivity and the other develops thermoelectric cooling systems, according to the company’s website.</td>

      <td>Heineken thinks operating margins will only recover to pre-Covid levels in 2023, while smaller rival Carlsberg is already back on track</td>
      <td>Global brewers are recovering from the pandemic at unequal speeds.<br />On Wednesday,  Heineken  said it sold 8% less beer in the three months through December compared with the same period of 2019. After better-than-expected sales over the summer, fresh lockdowns in key markets such as the U.K. set the world’s second-largest brewer back again in the fourth quarter. Heineken estimates that less than 30% of bars and restaurants in Europe are currently open.<br />Its outlook for this year is cloudy. Although nightlife venues may begin to reopen in a few months, bars won’t be selling beer at normal volumes while social-distancing measures remain in place. That will weigh on Heineken’s sales, around one-third of which typically come from eating and drinking venues outside the home. The brewer doesn’t expect operating margins to get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023.<br />Its guidance for a grinding three-year profit recovery is at odds with what is happening at smaller rival  Carlsberg .  The Danish brewer, which reported full-year numbers last week, actually managed to grow its operating margins in 2020 compared with the previous year. After seeing the impact of the virus in China, its biggest market, Carlsberg didn’t delay in taking costs out of the business. Heineken is only now beginning a major drive to reduce its overheads by around €2 billion, equivalent to $2.4 billion.<br />Anheuser-Busch InBev  doesn’t report its 2020 numbers until later this month. However, Barclays analyst Laurence Whyatt thinks the Budweiser owner will make slow progress between now and 2025. “We don’t expect them to get back to their 2019 margins within our forecasting period…. We are concerned about their pricing power,” he said.</td>

      <td>To rivals’ chagrin, Toyota says it is doing just fine with the global automotive chip shortage</td>
      <td>A sharp rebound in car sales has paradoxically threatened the auto sector’s recovery as car makers contend with severe shortages of automotive chips. Except, apparently, for Japan’s automotive colossus:  Toyota  says it’s doing just fine.<br />Strong results at Japan’s largest car makers show the car market is back on track after the doldrums of early 2020. Toyota said on Wednesday that its operating profit for the quarter ending in December grew 54% from a year earlier while sales increased 7%.  Honda  and  Nissan  likewise reported earnings growth that were ahead of analysts’ expectations.<br />Toyota saw year-over-year growth in all regions. Operating profit in North America more than doubled from a year earlier thanks to higher sales of sport-utility vehicles. That helped push the company’s overall operating margin to 12.1% last quarter, from 8.4% a year earlier.<br />The strong rebound in car sales has brought an unexpected problem, however, for most car makers: a severe chip shortage. A quick recovery after the sharp declines in auto sales early last year means chip makers are now unable to meet sudden new demand from car manufacturers. Adding to the problem, chip manufacturers are already running at capacity to produce components for other gadgets like personal computers and data centers, all of which got a boost from stay-at-home demand. The problem could last for months as it takes time for chip makers to ramp up capacity and readjust their product mix.<br />Most Western auto makers expect the problem to dampen their production. Honda and Nissan also expect the shortage to hurt sales, though they still revised up their profit forecast for the fiscal year ending in March. Honda lowered its sales volume forecast but expects cost cutting to offset the impact. Nissan expects the continuing restructuring of its business to help narrow expected losses.</td>

      <td>Chinese vaccine makers are racing to meet the needs of China and a growing list of countries, but there are signs that inoculations are going slower than planned.<br />In the Middle East and North Africa, countries that were depending on Chinese vaccines are experiencing delays as they try to inoculate their populations. The U.A.E, the first country outside China to approve a vaccine by Chinese state-owned drugmaker  Sinopharm ,  has switched to giving priority to the elderly, chronically ill and other select groups. It had been offering shots to everyone, which left residents waiting weeks for appointments.<br />At home, Chinese authorities have distributed more doses than many other countries, but several Western countries are ahead per capita—and China hasn’t started inoculating the elderly because of a lack of clinical trial data for that age group.<br />China had administered more than 40 million doses as of Feb. 9, according to the country’s health commission. That is far short of the goal that health officials set in a December conference call with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, according to people familiar with the matter: distributing 100 million doses before the start of the Lunar New Year holiday on Friday.<br />China isn’t alone. Vaccine shipments have been delayed around the world. But many developing countries are counting on China’s vaccines as among the few affordable and available options, and Beijing has made vaccine diplomacy a part of its foreign policy.</td>

Those discussions have centered on data security and ways to prevent the information TikTok collects on American users from being accessed by the Chinese government, they said.<br />But no imminent decision on how to resolve the issues surrounding TikTok is expected as the Biden administration determines its own response to the potential security risk posed by Chinese tech companies’ collection of data.<br />“We plan to develop a comprehensive approach to securing U.S. data that addresses the full range of threats we face,” National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said. “This includes the risk posed by Chinese apps and other software that operate in the U.S. In the coming months, we expect to review specific cases in light of a comprehensive understanding of the risks we face.”</td>

But the current weakness suggests questions remain about the vigor of the economic recovery.<br />For banks, this weighed on profit. Net interest income, the spread between what banks charge borrowers and pay depositors, fell 5% across the industry last year—a consequence of shrinking loan portfolios and near-zero interest rates. It was the biggest drop in more than 80 years of record-keeping, according to research by Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at Wells Fargo.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats will begin formally making their case Wednesday to convict former President Donald Trump, a day after the Senate voted to proceed with Mr. Trump’s second impeachment trial.<br />After an afternoon of arguments Tuesday on whether it was constitutional to try a former president, six Republican senators joined all Democrats in a 56-44 vote asserting the Senate’s authority to try Mr. Trump, who was impeached by the House last month in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. He left office Jan. 20.<br />Starting at noon, Democrats will have 16 hours to make their case, after which Mr. Trump’s defense team will have another 16 hours. Each trial day is expected to last eight hours. Both sides will also have the option to call for a debate and vote on calling witnesses, but it isn’t clear whether either side will seek to do so. Democrats last week asked Mr. Trump to testify, which the former president’s lawyers shot down.<br />Democrats are expected to offer as evidence video and audio presentations of the Jan. 6 riot, as they make their case that Mr. Trump incited his supporters to storm the Capitol. On Tuesday, House impeachment managers played a 13-minute video of Mr. Trump encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol and of the subsequent violence that resulted in five deaths, including that of a Capitol Police officer.<br />“That’s a high crime and misdemeanor,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the lead impeachment manager, said before playing the video on Tuesday. “If that’s not an impeachable offense, then there’s no such thing.”</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—China’s ban on Australian coal imports is intensifying a crisis in its coal market, which is battling surging prices, supply shortages, conflicting policy goals and a cold winter.<br />Locked in a diplomatic brawl over Canberra’s call for an independent global inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, Beijing imposed an informal ban around September that forced boatloads of Australian coal to languish at sea. China’s central government made the embargo official at a mid-December meeting with major Chinese electricity producers, who are big buyers of thermal coal.<br />The ban complicated a supply crunch that the meeting was convened to solve, government and state media reports show. China was short of thermal coal and officials urged the companies to import more—from anywhere except Australia, China’s biggest supplier. To comply, buyers in China have had to pay steep premiums for imports from farther afield, on top of prices that have risen 84% since midyear.<br />“Coal buyers are on tenterhooks watching the import market,” the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association, which represents importers, said in a statement. “It’s been hard to replenish low coal inventory and shortages, while demand is unabated.”<br />From Norwegian salmon to Mongolian commodities, Beijing has in recent years increasingly used China’s buying heft to apply political pressure abroad—but the coal market is showing that the strategy can backfire. Even as Chinese buyers obeyed Beijing, Australia’s coal prices rallied as other buyers from big coal-consuming nations, including Japan and India, stepped in.</td>

      <td>Top moments and themes from Tuesday’s presentations and vote on the constitutionality of the proceedings</td>
      <td>Here are five takeaways from the first day of the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump.<br />1. Democrats Draw Some GOP Support, but Face Uphill Battle<br />Tuesday’s debate and vote focused on whether a former president can be tried by the Senate in an impeachment proceeding. After an afternoon of presentations by House managers and former President Trump’s lawyers, the Senate voted 56-44 that the case was constitutional and could proceed, as six Republicans sided with Democrats on that narrow question. But the vote total was well short of the 67 that will be needed to convict the former president on the broader question of whether he incited an insurrection at the Capitol. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana was the only Republican to shift to the Democrats’ position on the question of constitutionality. He had sided with Republicans in a test vote last month over the constitutionality of trying a former president. On Tuesday, he sided with Democrats in asserting that the Senate had jurisdiction.<br />2. Debating the ‘January Exception’ to Impeachment<br />Democrats said the trial was on solid legal footing and that the Constitution didn’t include a “January exception” that would allow presidents to go unpunished for improper actions in the final weeks of their tenure. Mr. Trump’s lawyers countered that the Senate can’t try Mr. Trump because he is now a private citizen and can’t be penalized by removal from office. “Presidents are impeachable, presidents are removable,” said Trump lawyer David Schoen. “Former presidents are not because they cannot be removed.” But lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.) argued that removal from office was never “the exclusive purpose of impeachment in America.’’ Democrats plan to hold a vote to bar Mr. Trump from office if he is convicted.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Republican senators criticized former President Donald Trump’s impeachment lawyers’ presentations as underwhelming and ineffective, even as all but six GOP lawmakers sided with the defense team’s position that the case was unconstitutional.<br />In an afternoon session dedicated to the question of whether the trial was constitutional, Trump lawyer Bruce L. Castor Jr. had a rough start: He introduced himself as the “lead prosecutor,” before clarifying that he was Mr. Trump’s lead counsel and assuring senators: “I do understand the difference.”<br />In about 45 minutes of remarks, Mr. Castor veered from the fall of Rome and Greece to the trade-off between liberty and security, occasionally referencing his relationships with some senators while only briefly addressing the core questions of the case.<br />In an unusual concession, he said Democrats’ leadoff arguments had been better than expected. “I’ll be quite frank with you: We changed what we were going to do on account that we thought the House managers’ presentation was well done,” Mr. Castor said.<br />Republicans offered harsh assessments of Mr. Trump’s team, while many praised the Democrats’ lead manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, as well-prepared and impassioned.</td>

      <td>The president gives another bleak assessment on the economy while his Labor Department reports an increase in job openings.</td>
      <td>The young Biden administration has already settled into an odd pattern of dissonance between the economic data the government reports and the president’s characterization of the economy. Encouraging updates from federal agencies are followed by gloomy proclamations from the Oval Office intended to justify massive federal action. Tuesday brought another bleak political message on the heels of a positive market reading.<br />In the morning the Labor Department reported that U.S. job openings ticked up in December to 6.6 million. This not only represented a slight increase from November’s historically high reading of 6.5 million but also exceeded the prior-year level during the pre-Covid salad days.<br />Recently this column noted that, in the language of the Obama-Biden administration, our new President Joe Biden has received a sizable “inheritance” from his predecessor in terms of a rebounding economy.  Measured in terms of the number of open positions for U.S. workers, the last full month of the Trump presidency is the greatest “inheritance” any U.S. president has ever passed on to his successor.<br />December’s 6.6 million job openings exceed by more than a million the number in President Barack Obama’s last full month in office. And President Biden’s “inheritance” from Donald Trump is more than twice the size of the one President George W. Bushbequeathed to Mr. Obama.<br />But you would never know it listening to Mr. Biden at the White House  today. Prior to a meeting with corporate chieftains, the president didn’t mention the good news his government had reported just hours earlier. Instead, he offered essentially the same talking points he’s been using since last spring’s shutdowns.</td>

      <td>Shares have soared recently, but heavy investments show the social-media platform has some rough edges to smooth out</td>
      <td>Social media is often about appearing to be more polished than you really are.  Twitter  is no exception.<br />From the looks of its fourth-quarter report, the company hardly seems like one that has recently been embroiled in political controversy. In that quarter, Twitter was the subject of frequent criticism from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans. And in January, it booted Mr. Trump off its platform. His account was once followed by nearly half the company’s total base of monetizable daily users, and the move enraged many of them in the process.<br />On the surface, at least, it doesn’t seem to have mattered. The company said Tuesday it boosted the number of users by 27% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter and that people continued to flock to the platform throughout January despite the political criticism from both right and left.<br />But looks can be deceiving. In its shareholder letter, Twitter managed to avoid the elephant in the room, opting to share its outlook for the remainder of 2021 without much political context. But it did say it expects to see user growth slow from 27% in the fourth quarter to low-double digits in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, indicating the 34% pace the company posted in the second quarter of 2020 was about as good as it gets.<br />Twitter’s shares are up 39% over the last three months, even before they rose another 3% after hours on Tuesday. Those are roughly the same gains as  Pinterest ,  a social-media service that reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 76% last week and projected another quarter of 70%-plus sales growth for the first quarter. Twitter’s first-quarter guidance for revenue growth of just over 22% at the midpoint looks rather dull by comparison.</td>

      <td>Democrats lobby Biden to write off debt for affluent borrowers.</td>
      <td>The Biden Presidency is quickly turning into Barack Obama’s third term, only more liberal. Consider the Democrats calling on President Biden to use the pandemic to cancel $50,000 in student debt per borrower. What they want everyone to forget is that in 2010 they used the last recession to justify a federal takeover of student loans that have since more than doubled to $1.6 trillion. Now they’re using the pandemic to justify loan write-offs they said would never happen.<br />The great student loan scam began in 2010 when Democrats used budget “savings” from ending the federal guaranteed-loan program to pay for ObamaCare. “By cutting out the middleman, we’ll save American taxpayers $68 billion in the coming years,” Mr. Obama declared. Where were the media fact-checkers then?<br />An analysis for the Education Department last year estimated that $435 billion in student loans (excluding private originated loans that are federally guaranteed) will eventually be written off. One reason: Democrats in 2010 created “income-based repayment plans” that limited borrower monthly payments to 10% of discretionary income and discharged the remaining balance after 20 years.<br />These plans now comprise a third of new undergraduate and nearly 60% of graduate loans. Since many borrowers are making only de minimis payments, their balances continue to grow and accrue interest, although most will be forgiven. In other words, the feds are already set to write down a large chunk of debt.<br />But unwilling to let the pandemic go to waste, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer and House Democrats are demanding that Mr. Biden go further and cancel as much as $50,000 in debt per person. Ms. Warren says this would cost taxpayers a wee $650 billion and “boost our economy right now.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The second impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump opened with graphic videos of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Some of the clips played by the House impeachment managers featured the senators themselves and the same chamber in which they now sit in judgment.<br />Almost all 100 senators, most of them masked because of Covid-19, silently watched and listened in the hushed chamber as rioters on the screens rammed doors, attacked police, and chanted: “Treason!” and “Traitors!” and “Where the f--- are they?!”<br />The trial began 27 days after the House impeached Mr. Trump, accusing him of inciting the mob that stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn his loss to President Biden in the November election.<br />As the video played Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) watched from his front-row seat near the middle of the floor. He sat motionless, his hands clasped loosely in his lap, as the video replayed his own forceful speech from that same spot, shortly before rioters broke into the building.<br />In those remarks, Mr. McConnell said there was no doubt that Mr. Biden won the presidency on Nov. 3. He warned that overturning the election would send democracy into a “death spiral.”</td>

The average yield on U.S. junk bonds dropped below 4% for the first time on Monday amid a market scavenger hunt for higher returns.<br />The Federal Reserve has pushed down long-term interest rates by buying bonds and committed to keep short-term interest rates at near zero through 2023. While the central bank’s interventions were needed in March, it continued to buy corporate bonds well into the summer when markets didn’t need the support.<br />Chairman Jerome Powell last month reassured investors that the Fed won’t take away its market support until the economy makes “substantial further progress” toward inflation above 2% and maximum employment. The rush into high-yield corporate and municipal debt has since accelerated with yields dropping due to great demand.<br />Junk-rated Chicago Public Schools and the city of Detroit recently floated bonds yielding less than 2%. Spreads with the AAA muni-bond benchmark have collapsed. The sages at  BlackRock  last month recommended high-yield munis for their “diversification benefits” and “high levels of income” and saw “significant value” in Puerto Rican bonds.<br />Investors are on the prowl for high-yield corporates, and money managers are cold-calling non-investment grade companies to pitch deals. January was a record month for junk-bond sales. Companies rated in the three lowest non-investment tiers before default have set records for weekly borrowing twice this year, says  Bank of America .  Investors are even snapping up junk bonds that fund dividends and those that allow borrowers to pay interest with more debt.</td>

      <td>Even allies are asking Biden to reconsider his executive order.</td>
      <td>President Biden may not have buyers’ remorse over his executive order canceling the Keystone XL oil pipeline, but many others are raising the political price for his job-killing decision. And some of the second thoughts are coming from his own coalition.<br />On Tuesday West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin wrote Mr. Biden asking him “to reconsider” his executive order. Mr. Manchin, who introduced the first Keystone XL bill in 2012, noted that “pipelines continue to be the safest mode to transport our oil and natural gas resources and they support thousands of high-paying, American union jobs.”<br />Mr. Manchin’s call echoed remarks by Richard Trumka. In a recent interview with “Axios on HBO,” the president of the AFL-CIO criticized Mr. Biden’s decision and said the Laborers’ International Union of North America was right to say it would cost 1,000 existing union jobs and 10,000 projected construction jobs.<br />The union chief was also skeptical about the “green jobs” that Mr. Biden keeps saying will replace them: “You know, when they laid off at the mines back in Pennsylvania, they told us they were going to train us to be computer programmers.” Readers may recall that John Kerry, Mr. Biden’s climate envoy, recently said workers who lose jobs in fossil fuels will be able to make solar panels. Sure, if they move to China, where most solar panels are made.<br />Meanwhile, 14 Republican state attorneys general also wrote Mr. Biden asking him to reconsider his Keystone XL diktat. The AGs said Montana will lose $58 million in tax revenue, and “five of the six impacted counties are designated high-poverty areas. So your decision to shut down the project means less money for schools, less money for public services, and the elimination of business and job opportunities in those areas where they are most needed.”</td>

      <td>Even Senate Democrats wonder why he ousted an Illinois U.S. Attorney.</td>
      <td>A new President abruptly fires a prosecutor overseeing high-level political corruption cases. That’s big news, right? Well, it was in 2017 when President Trump axed Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time and a media favorite. You can tell power in Washington has changed hands because of the muted response as the Biden White House ousts U.S. Attorney John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois.<br />Joe Biden is swiftly pushing out almost all U.S. attorneys who served under his predecessor, which is increasingly the norm for new Presidents. But even Illinois Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, staunch allies of Mr. Biden, objected to his firing of Mr. Lausch, who has been a scourge of corruption in Democratic-dominated Springfield.<br />“While we agree with the Biden Administration’s criminal justice agenda, we are disappointed with the decision to terminate U.S. Attorney Lausch without consulting us,” the Senators said in a statement Tuesday. They cited the need to “conclude sensitive investigations” and added that “Mr. Lausch should be permitted to continue in his position until his successor is confirmed by the Senate.”<br />Mr. Lausch’s corruption probes have implicated a Chicago alderman and Springfield politicians. In July 2020 his office announced a $200 million settlement with the state’s primary electric utility company for its efforts to buy off “associates of a high-level elected official for the state of Illinois.”<br />That official is reported to be Michael Madigan, who until last month had been Speaker of the Illinois House for all but two years since 1983. The investigation is continuing, and there’s no reason outside of politics that Mr. Lausch shouldn’t be kept on the job until the Senate confirms a successor. Mr. Lausch’s four-year term ends in November 2021, and getting a replacement could take that long.</td>

      <td>Students debate the lessons of the Reddit-driven GameStop mania.</td>
      <td>Editor’s note: This week’s Future View discusses the role of social media  in coordinating the  GameStop  stock-market mania. For next week we’ll ask, “How has your experience of the internship and job market changed at different stages of the pandemic? What advice would you give to other students?” Click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Feb. 16. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />The Greater Fool<br />The extent to which the Reddit users discussing investments do good is proportional to their participation in the price-discovery mechanism. At its best, social media serves as a forum for retail investors to conduct and share research. Investors, acting on the profit motive, will attempt to discover discrepancies between the price and long-term value of a security. If, say, a given security’s long-term value is greater than its current market price, investors will buy, raising demand and driving the market price up toward the long-term value. Minimizing price discrepancies encourages efficient allocation of capital, and collaboration through social media allows retail investors to take advantage of research otherwise available only to large institutions.<br />At its worst, social-media driven investors actively undermine the price- discovery mechanism. GameStop and AMC feature prominently in headlines, but  BB Liquidating Inc.  best illustrates the patent absurdity of Redditor investing. A remnant of the bankrupt Blockbuster Video, the firm’s latest Form 10-K states that it has “no ongoing business operations” and “will not have any operations in the future.” Nevertheless, in a few days in late January its share price rose 3,000%, giving the company an intraday high of $44 million in market capitalization.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday named Suzanne Clark as its new chief executive, succeeding retiring CEO Thomas Donohue, who has led the organization since 1997.<br />Ms. Clark, 53 years old, a longtime ally of Mr. Donohue, 82, has served as president since 2019 and will retain that title along with that of CEO. The appointment, which takes effect March 11, had been expected.<br />“Suzanne Clark’s extensive experience through ever increasing responsibilities during her more than 16 years at the Chamber, combined with her ambitious vision and ongoing work to strengthen the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, make her the resounding choice to lead the organization into the future,” Chamber Board Chairman Christopher Lofgren said in a statement.<br />Ms. Clark will be the first woman to lead the 100-year-old organization, which has long been regarded as corporate America’s principal voice in Washington. But she takes over at a challenging time.<br />In the past decade, the Chamber and other business interests have lost influence in Washington as more extreme ideologies have gained ground in both the Republican and Democratic parties, leaving fewer lawmakers to promote business-friendly policies.</td>

      <td>Begin with a goal, focus on the long term, talk to the other side, and never make empty threats.</td>
      <td>To the world, George P. Shultz was one of the 20th century’s most consequential people—a giant of economics and diplomacy. The man we knew had a unique ability to translate ideas into policies. Call it “the Shultz way.”<br />It always began with a goal. He wanted to expand liberty and prosperity and knew free markets were the best way to do it. At Princeton he’d been a varsity football player, and he often used sports analogies. The “accountability factor is unavoidable in all sports,” he’d say. “The free market system is one of accountability, which will work relentlessly against bad performance and reward the good.”<br />In developing policies, the Shultz way took account of the politics surrounding an issue but never lost sight of the goal. In 1971, as director of the Office of Management and Budget, he explained his approach to policy making in a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago. “Those of you familiar with sailing know what a telltale is—a strip of cloth tied to a mast to show which way the wind is blowing,” he explained. “A captain has the choice of steering his ship by the telltale, following the prevailing winds, or to steer by the compass. In a democracy, you must keep your eye on the telltale, but you must set your course by the compass.”<br />His policy approach focused on the long term. He sought to identify challenges as they emerged and develop policies to ensure that they didn’t become problems. He loved bringing people together to hash out policy solutions. Shultz was the “great convener.” He regularly gave dinners and lunches at his house on the Stanford campus or in San Francisco. He held seminars in his conference rooms at the Hoover Institution, bringing together diverse groups of academics. He hosted Nobel Laureates like Milton Friedman and Gary Becker at an annual economists weekend in Monterey, Calif. Policy makers of both parties—including former presidents—eagerly accepted his invitations and will miss them now that he is gone.<br />These get-togethers were, in part, social. But they also had a more important purpose: to develop big policies and figure out how to turn ideas to action.</td>

      <td>To hear progressives talk, you’d think Canada and the U.S. emerged from enemy occupations.</td>
      <td>Toronto<br />Canada and the U.S. have much in common—history, geography, culture and cherished values of free speech and assembly. Since the U.S. election in November, we have something more in common: We are both “back.” President Biden tweeted as much a couple of weeks after the election: “America is back.” The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, also tweeted a “Welcome back” to America that month. A couple of weeks ago, the Toronto Star featured an article with the headline “Joe Biden’s inauguration was a message to the world: America is back.”<br />Canada has been back since October 2015, when, on his victorious election night, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, “On behalf of 35 million Canadians, we’re back.” He was re-elected in 2019, and though his parliamentary majority was reduced to a minority, he and we remain back.<br />Where were Canada and the U.S. before coming back? Away, apparently. Gone baby, gone. The U.S. and Canada suffered through modern Dark Ages, dictatorial enemy occupations from which there was no respite and in which there was no hope. That is, until citizens voting in free elections, following years of open debate and criticism, ousted President Trump and Prime Minister Stephen Harper.<br />Canada has been back for longer than the U.S., but Americans have already gotten a taste of what’s in store. First, virtue signaling: Messrs. Biden and Trudeau both made a show of selecting diverse cabinets. Mr. Biden rejoined the powerless Paris Agreement and Mr. Trudeau tried to win Canada a U.N. Security Council seat. He failed, but we’re still back. You may get to know the feeling.</td>

We drafted a constitution and planned for new elections.<br />We Yemenis have learned the hard way the price of a collapsed democratic transition. In 2014 Houthi armed factions, backed by Iran, seized power and plunged Yemen into civil war. The Houthis have attacked civilian targets, including schools, mosques, airports and parades. They have launched drones and ballistic missiles at neighboring countries, and have coordinated with U.S.-designated terrorist groups such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah. Last week we learned they are still obstructing international efforts to salvage the FSO Safer oil tanker and avert an environmental catastrophe.<br />Unfortunately, much of Congress’s attention—notably among Democrats—has focused not on the Houthis but on the Arab countries striving to restore Yemen’s legitimate government in line with multiple U.N. resolutions.<br />We welcome President Biden’s desire to accelerate a negotiated solution, even after announcing the end of U.S. assistance for the coalition’s “offensive” operations.</td>

      <td>Their rigid opposition to charter schools and in-person learning has parents and even politicians fed up.</td>
      <td>Perhaps it doesn’t receive much attention anymore because it’s become so commonplace. The best schools in New York state are again public charter schools. Ho-hum.<br />According to the most recent data from School Digger, a website that aggregates test score results, 23 of the top 30 schools in New York in 2019 were charters. The feat is all the more impressive because those schools sported student bodies that were more than 80% black and Hispanic, and some two-thirds of the kids qualified for free or discount lunches. The Empire State’s results were reflected nationally. In a U.S. News & World Report ranking released the same year, three of the top 10 public high schools in the country were charters, as were 23 of the top 100—even though charters made up only 10% of the nation’s 24,000 public high schools.<br />We are told constantly by defenders of the education status quo that the learning gap is rooted in poverty, segregation and “systemic” racism. We’re told that blaming traditional public schools for substandard student outcomes isn’t fair given the raw material that teachers have to work with. But if a student’s economic background is so decisive, or if black students need to be seated next to whites to understand Shakespeare and geometry, how can it be that so many of the most successful public schools are dominated by low-income minorities?<br />Some will argue that charter schools obtain these results by picking the best students, which isn’t true. Of the 43 states that have charters, all but three—Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming—mandate that lotteries be used to choose students randomly. Washington Post education writer Jay Matthews reports that even states that don’t officially require the use of lotteries use them anyway or employ “other impartial ways of admitting students.”<br />A second popular argument against charter schools is that they benefit from having motivated students, which is true but misleading. Numerous empirical studies have shown that charter students outperformed similarly motivated peers in traditional public schools who applied to a charter but weren’t admitted. But there’s an even more fundamental problem with the “motivation” explanation of charter success, as Thomas Sowell explains in his most recent book, “Charter Schools and Their Enemies.”</td>

      <td>It was the ﬁrst time that a black man in the South had dared to sue a white mob for damages, and it caused a sensation.</td>
      <td>Around 12 o’clock on the cold, moonlit night of Jan. 21, 1897, a 42-year-old black farmer named George Dinning, his wife, Mollie, and seven of their children were sleeping in their cabin near Price’s Mill, Ky., when they were awakened by two dozen white men surrounding the house. Wielding pistols and shotguns, the mob accused Dinning of some recent thefts and ordered him to vacate his 125-acre farm, which he had purchased 20 years before from the family that had enslaved him.<br />When Dinning called out that he wasn’t guilty, and could prove it, the men fired into the cabin, grazing him in the head and arm. Still in his underclothes, he grabbed his shotgun, ran to an upstairs window and got off a single round of birdshot, killing 32-year-old Jodie Conn, the son of a wealthy planter. The mob fired another volley and then retreated. The next morning Dinning surrendered to the Simpson County sheriff, Bud Clark. That same day, several men returned to the farm, evicted Mollie, and torched the fields, house and outbuildings. She and the children fled to relatives in Tennessee.<br />Kentucky (birthplace of both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis) had declared neutrality in the Civil War, but racist violence was common there in the 1890s, with 10 lynchings recorded in the 13 months before the attack on George Dinning. As Ben Montgomery relates in “A Shot in the Moonlight,” his deeply felt, copiously researched chronicle of this episode and its repercussions, what made Dinning’s case extraordinary, even more than his forceful self-defense, was his unprecedented search for justice.<br />Dinning was aided by a surprising number of whites, starting with Sheriff Clark, who spirited his prisoner to distant Louisville for safekeeping. Later, when Dinning was conveyed back to Simpson County to be tried for murder, many doubted that he would live to see the verdict. But Republican Gov. William Bradley, who had recently signed an anti-lynching law, dispatched two companies of soldiers to guard the accused, along with a pair of cannon.<br />When the trial began, in June, the prosecution witnesses admitted to being in the crowd that night but claimed that they had gone with friendly intent and were leaving when Dinning fired. The defense attorney, a local man known for fairness, seized on the implausibilities and inconsistencies in their testimony. Why would Dinning shoot if the men were dispersing? When the white jury returned, they found the defendant not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, sentencing him to seven years at hard labor.</td>

      <td>An activist investor is preparing to launch a proxy fight at trucking and logistics company  Forward Air Corp.<br />Ancora Holdings Inc. plans to nominate four directors to Forward Air’s 10-person board, including the company’s founder and its former chief financial officer, according to people familiar with the matter. The group holds a combined 6.3% stake in the Greeneville, Tenn., company, the people said.<br />Forward Air, which has a market value of around $2.3 billion, specializes in expedited less-than-truckload services, including airport-to-airport shipments of high value products such as automotive parts and electronics equipment. It also has smaller intermodal and pool-distribution segments. Like other trucking and logistics companies, its volumes dropped sharply in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, though they have since been recovering.<br />The activist group believes the company has other problems. It argues that Forward Air’s performance has lagged behind that of peers like XPO Logistics Inc. and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. because it has diversified instead of staying focused on its core expedited business, the people said. The group blames this on acquisitions and capital expenditures over the past decade or so that have hurt the company’s return on invested capital.<br />The activist’s goal is to get its four director candidates voted in at the annual meeting so they can affect changes including strengthening management and improving margins. Its candidates are Forward Air’s founder Scott Niswonger, former CFO Andrew Clarke, Ancora’s James Chadwick and leadership consultant Dawn Garibaldi, the people said.</td>

      <td>Strategy will delay broader vaccine awareness push until supply increases and instead target vaccine skepticism in narrower effort</td>
      <td>The Biden administration plans to ramp up a public safety campaign focused on social distancing and mask wearing to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the coming weeks as states begin relaxing public-health measures, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />But the administration will delay a broad national campaign it had been planning that would promote vaccine awareness until more doses are available, the person said, and will instead launch a limited version targeting smaller groups where skepticism is pervasive.<br />The decision to focus on masks and distancing and to temporarily narrow its vaccine campaign announced Jan. 21 reflects what health authorities have been saying for weeks: Mask wearing, social distancing, and testing are critical as new variants spread, because there may not be enough vaccines to inoculate most people in the U.S. until late summer. Meanwhile, states including New York, Massachusetts, Iowa, North Dakota, Minnesota, New Jersey and Washington have relaxed mask mandates or indoor-dining restrictions.<br />Scarcity of vaccine doses and complications in the rollout have led to long waits for shots in many states.<br />Vaccine skepticism remains a barrier to getting shots to populations most at risk. About one-third of Black adults say they plan to avoid the vaccine, compared with about one-fifth of Hispanic and white adults who don’t plan to get vaccinated, according to recent survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</td>

      <td>U.S. farmers said new trade deals are critical to help boost agricultural producers after the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic and the Trump administration’s trade battles.<br />Firming up existing trade agreements and joining with multicountry trade pacts would give U.S. producers better prices for some products than they can get domestically, farmers said at the WSJ Global Food Forum. Farmers said giving priority to trade would help reduce the need for government aid, which climbed to a record level in 2020 as the Trump administration sought to stem losses from the U.S.-China trade war and the food-supply chain was upended by the pandemic.<br />“If we don’t have trade we’re not going to get the full value of what we’re selling,” said Kimberly Ratcliff, a Texas cattle rancher.<br />Mr. Trump’s tenure was a turbulent time for U.S. farmers, who have grown more reliant on selling their crops and meat overseas as domestic production outstrips the appetites of U.S. consumers. Duties the Trump administration levied on goods from China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union sparked retaliatory tariffs targeting U.S. agricultural products from pork to soybeans to apples, cutting into U.S. agricultural exports and sending farm commodity prices plunging.<br />President Biden said during his campaign that he would scale back trade disputes and align like-minded countries to push nations, including China, to engage in fairer trade practices. That approach could limit China’s ability to target U.S. farm goods with retaliatory tariffs, Mr. Biden’s campaign said, protecting U.S. farmers from market swings.</td>

The agency made the request Monday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn.<br />GPB Capital’s founder and former chief executive, David Gentile, as well as associates Jeffry Schneider and Jeffrey Lash, were arrested on criminal fraud and conspiracy charges last week in connection with what the authorities said was a scheme to deceive some 17,000 investors in four GPB funds, including two that invested in auto dealerships.<br />“The principal source for potential investor recovery is revenue generated by the several dozen automobile dealerships owned by GPB Capital,” the SEC said in a court filing to support its request for an independent monitor. “These dealerships have contractual relationships with lenders and manufacturers that are now at risk of termination because of, among other things, Gentile’s arrest.”<br />Mr. Gentile stepped down as CEO of GPB Capital on Friday, the day after the charges were brought against him in federal court, but the firm indicated the move was temporary and named Rob Chmiel, its chief financial officer, as interim CEO. Mr. Gentile owns GPB Capital.</td>

      <td>Kyle Allen and Kathryn Newton play teenagers stuck in a ‘Groundhog Day’-like time loop.</td>
      <td>‘Groundhog Day” was released in theaters 28 years ago (Feb. 12, 1993) and has only grown in stature over the years; it ranks alongside “Rashomon” as a 20th-century-born archetype of cinematic storytelling. Imitations, naturally, abound: Last year’s “Palm Springs” was yet another variation on the theme. But when a movie comes right out and acknowledges its debt—as does “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things”—it does a lot to win you over.<br />“Wasn’t there a movie…?” asks Henry (Jermaine Harris), as his friend Mark (Kyle Allen) tries to explain the “temporal anomaly” he’s found himself in—the same day on an endless loop, the same lottery number winning, Henry regularly losing the same videogame every time they hang out. Yeah, yeah, Mark answers, acknowledging the “Groundhog” question, but knowing, too, that Henry won’t remember their conversation tomorrow—or whenever it is. And that the video aliens Henry is facing off against will, for the umpteenth time, blow his avatar’s head off.<br />Based on a short story and screenplay by Lev Grossman and directed by Ian Samuels, “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things” introduces Mark like he’s the smiling steel ball in a Rube Goldberg contraption, rolling by and through events and people in such a seamless, choreographed manner it suggests he’s prescient, or a complete wise guy, or some kind of delinquent. Then one realizes that he’s done and seen the same thing so many times that he has everything timed to the split second. And he knows every move. By everyone. He even carries a pair of tongs in his back pocket on his way to school to straighten, surreptitiously, the skirt of a woman whose slip is showing. Every day.<br />The inescapable distraction with a film like “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things” is the search for the logical holes in the fabric of the story. If a certain thing happens today, one asks oneself, can it happen again…today? We don’t know how long Mark’s been stuck, but he’s got everything rehearsed to such a T that it might be years. Is he getting older? Is anyone else?<br />The larger hiccup in one’s digestion of Mr. Grossman’s storyline is Mark’s discovery of Margaret (Kathryn Newton, “Big Little Lies”), who is also trapped in time but wants little to do with Mark—she won’t even discuss how they got into their time bubble, or how to get out. Margaret knows more than she’s telling. Mark is intrigued by the ripple Margaret has caused in his time-space-romance continuum.</td>

      <td>A Discovery+ documentary re-examines the sensational 2013 murder trial that turned the accused into a public villain.</td>
      <td>Jodi Arias was young, beautiful and by every indication a ruthless murderer, a combination that made her not only an object of media fascination when she went on trial in 2013 but of public vilification that seemed to take on a life of its own. It was a sensational case—Arias, now serving life without parole, had presented a number of wildly different stories at the beginning of the investigation, wound up testifying to her own disadvantage for 18 days, and was at the center of an event that was widely considered a circus. It was a sordid affair, but the way it occupied the intersection of criminal justice and the media gave it a special place among capital cases,<br />“If I Can’t Have You: The Jodi Arias Story” is certainly a Jodi Arias story—it offers, among other new details, glimpses of Arias’s journal entries and interviews with friends of Travis Alexander, the ex-boyfriend businessman murdered in 2008. It offers up gory if not overly gruesome crime-scene photos; it explores Alexander’s Mormonism and the way it affected the couple’s relationship and the case; it examines the unfaithfulness and jealousy that provided motive (hence the series title). If there’s a message being sent by Discovery+, it’s that the new streaming service will remain faithful to the stuff that has made Investigation Discovery a destination for true-crime devotees (while also offering Animal Planet, Food Network, HGTV, OWN, TLC, Travel Channel and other Discovery Inc.-affiliated outlets). The Arias case, after all, is the kind of well to which one can return time and again, without running dry of appalling minutiae.<br />This may be part of the strategy behind the two-part program, whose producers seem to be hedging their bets. One of the principal interviewees is attorney Jennifer Willmott, a member of the Arias defense team and one of the lawyers who saved a widely disparaged client from the death penalty. (The jury had voted 8-4 in favor of execution before a deadlock was declared.) Much of the miniseries is devoted to the self-defense strategy that was put forth by Ms. Willmott and L. Kirk Nurmi (whom Arias sued after he wrote a book about her case. He was later disbarred.). Their defense included accusations of abuse against Arias both by her father and by Alexander. As explained toward the end of episode 2, there are hopes that Arias will be granted a new trial based on the media coverage of the first, the unexplored aspects of the investigation, and the misbehavior of the prosecutor, former Maricopa County deputy attorney Juan Martinez. (He too was disbarred, last year, and appears in the show.)<br />While the public loathing of Arias is made quite plain at the beginning of episode 1, it’s not until late in the game that the details of the Alexander murder are revisited. Alexander was stabbed at least 27 times (the exact number seems to be disputed). His throat was cut. He was shot in the head. Self-defense can be argued. So can abuse. What “If I Can’t Have You” doesn’t want to argue very strenuously is vicious premeditated murder, because it may well be that we have not seen the last of Jodi Arias. And smart producers burn no bridges.</td>

      <td>I look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats alike on making our democracy more accessible.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Didn’t Vote? Here’s Your $20 Fine” (Feb. 5): In January, I suggested that voting should be considered a civic duty. The response has been a bit surprising. The editorial board questions whether there was an inherent benefit to high voter turnout. One of my colleagues told a talk radio host that I was looking to establish “voting police.” With fervor, conservatives have risen to the defense of every citizen’s right to disengage from civic life.<br />Our government expects all citizens to engage in a variety of activities for the national benefit: selective service, jury duty, the census and taxes all come to mind. Liberals and conservatives alike recognize that those institutions are so vital to our national livelihood that they cannot be built on a voluntary basis. But no activity is more core to the American project than voting. There is no benefit to low turnout. An uncast ballot is not an ideological triumph—it is merely an indication that our democratic government is not as representative as it ought to be. Perhaps that’s why 26 successful democracies, e.g., Australia, already have enacted civic-duty voting.<br />Still, I knew that such a bold reform would not become law anytime soon. Sadly, our country isn’t ready for it.<br />In Connecticut, I’m fighting for early voting, no-excuse absentee ballots and other reforms to make democracy more accessible. In pushing for these changes, Democrats often mention the very people whom you identify as less likely to vote—“busy single moms, apolitical 19-year-olds, the homeless”—as a reason to modernize our laws. Frustratingly, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle roll their eyes and claim that any citizen can figure out a way to cast a ballot.<br />So I called their bluff. I proposed civic-duty voting, and people on the right became newly concerned with voter access. They actually admitted that some citizens may not have convenient access to the ballot.</td>

      <td>Jason Riley’s “Progressives Put the Racial ‘Equity’ Squeeze on Biden” (Upward Mobility, Feb. 3) touches on the importance of controlling the narrative. The “E-word” used to stand for equality. But over the last few years diversity, equality and inclusion initiatives now speak to equity. Why the difference? As Mr. Riley states, equality can be interpreted as equal opportunity, while equity can assume an equal outcome, that a society’s wealth is owned in common and not primarily by those who create it. Equity means everyone has an equal share of the pie regardless of the contribution.<br />The word equality has now been tacitly banned; it will soon be labeled a construct of white privilege intended to coerce people to hard work. But it’s hard to unlearn the old narrative. Mr. Riley quotes the president as saying: “this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equity.” But listen to the audio. The president starts to say “racial equality” but catches himself in midword. He says: “racial equali . . . equity.” The old dog hasn’t fully learned the new trick. His trainers will make sure he does.<br />Fred Van Bennekom<br />Bolton, Mass.<br /></td>

Dissidents should never be linked to diplomacy over something as existential as nuclear war. If U.S. Presidents Nixon and Reagan had refused to negotiate nuclear-arms reductions with Russian leaders because of the way Moscow mistreated its dissidents, America’s most enduring nuclear treaties with Russia would never have helped both sides avoid nuclear war.<br />Mr. Biden’s decision to accept the longest possible extension (five years) of the New Start treaty without negotiating new conditions troubles you. Yet one of your complaints against the Iran nuclear accord in 2015 was that its limits on Tehran had expiration dates.<br />You argue that Russia violates arms accords. Yet we Americans pulled out of the 1972 missile-defense treaty and the 1987 intermediate-range missile treaty with Moscow. Treaties cannot be made with enemies willing to cheat, according to you. A favorite motto quoted on “The Sopranos” was: “Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.” In the age of “trust but verify,” nuclear treaties afford both sides that opportunity.<br />Frank Richter<br />Clawson, Mich.</td>

In the Senate, however, procedural rules for passing legislation without GOP support raise complications for Democrats hoping to quickly move a minimum-wage increase, and at least one Democrat—Sen.

Democratic leaders have said they hope to secure some GOP support, but they are making plans to pass the legislation without it. Still, they can’t afford to lose any Democratic votes in the evenly divided Senate.</td>

With a washable shell and rubber seal that molds to my face to minimize air leaks, the mask doesn’t feel scratchy like other medical-grade models I’ve tried. People even nerdier than me will like that it tracks your location to let you know the quality of the air and the approximate number of particles it’s protected you against.<br />Others I tested, like the N95-equipped MaskFone ($50, maskfone.com), have integrated wireless earbuds to prevent dreaded mask-muffle on calls, or mechanical ventilation systems that release heat you generate by exhaling. All are designed, according to their manufacturers, for a world where even getting vaccinated doesn’t obviate the need to wear a face-covering.<br />But, as buzzy as this wizardry might be, are high-tech masks really worth the fuss compared to their no-brainer counterparts?<br />Dale Pfriem, principal of Protective Equipment Consulting Services and part of a standards-development working group addressing federal mask guidelines, says he’s in favor of any feature that makes people more likely to wear their masks. As long as the products meet fit and filtration standards, that is. (The AirPop is compliant with EU Committee for Standardization and ASTM International barrier-mask guidelines.)</td>

It suffered badly during the 2008-09 financial crisis. The government merged its parents, the retail-lending cooperatives Banque Fédérale des Banques Populaires and Caisse Nationale des Caisses d’Epargne, creating BPCE, and rescued Natixis.

Decades of research have found that while many Poles risked their own lives to help Jews, others participated in or assisted the slaughter.<br />The ruling Law and Justice party has tried to limit discussion of the actions of Polish nationals in the genocide, warning that it considers any investigation into alleged complicity of Poles in the Holocaust as dishonoring Poland. It prefers to portray the country as a blameless victim of larger regional powers.<br />The party oversaw the introduction of a libel law in 2018 to punish anyone falsely accusing Poles of collaborating with the Nazis, despite objections from the U.S., Israel and some survivors from the Auschwitz concentration camp. “It is important to protect the good name of Poland and Polish people,” Polish President Andrzej Duda said at the time. “We have the right to our historical truth.”<br />Tuesday’s verdict, delivered by Warsaw district court, now threatens to widen the schism between the European Union’s executive in Brussels and more nationalistic-minded countries in the bloc’s east.

      <td>Acquisition of Glu Mobile is videogame publisher’s latest attempt to buy into a difficult market</td>
      <td>Leveling up in mobile games doesn’t come cheap these days. For  Electronic Arts ,  the payoff could be worth the price.<br />EA announced Monday afternoon that it has struck a deal to acquire  Glu Mobile  for $2.4 billion in cash. It is the videogame publisher’s second billion-dollar deal in as many months, following its surprise $1.25 billion takeout of U.K.-based racing-game maker  Codemasters  in December. Glu is EA’s largest deal to date, beating out the $1.3 billion spent on PopCap Games in 2011.<br />That deal also represented the last major attempt by EA to boost its mobile business. Since the iPhone ushered in the era of touch-screen mobile gaming in 2008, EA has made several moves to establish its position in a market that many observers believed would overtake consoles and PCs as the most dominant gaming platform. Smaller deals such as the acquisitions of game makers Firemint and Chillingo in 2010 and 2011 gave EA some popular games at the time such as “Flight Control” and “Real Racing.”<br />But EA never developed a Midas touch for mobile. Part of the problem came from the evolution of the mobile business away from games based on paid downloads and toward free-to-play titles that generate revenue from in-game transactions. Case in point: While buying PopCap gave EA control of the pioneering match-three game “Bejeweled,” it was “Candy Crush” that later came to dominate that category. EA’s rival  Activision Blizzard  acquired “Candy Crush” maker King Digital in 2015 and now generates more than $2 billion a year in mobile net bookings. EA’s mobile net bookings were just $779 million in calendar-year 2020.<br />Including Glu would have brought that total to about $1.3 billion. Doug Creutz of Cowen estimates the deal will make EA the seventh-largest mobile-game publisher. But simply adding games such as “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood” and “Diner Dash” to EA’s roster won’t justify the effort; Mr. Creutz says the real question is whether EA can effectively use Glu’s talent to enhance its other mobile properties.</td>

      <td>Salesforce.com Inc.  plans for most of its employees to work remotely part- or full-time after the pandemic and to reduce its real-estate footprint as a result, a top executive said, showing Covid-19’s lasting impact on how companies manage their workforces.<br />The business-software provider, which has 54,000 global employees, is among the largest companies to spell out how it plans staff to work after Covid-19 recedes. Chief People Officer Brent Hyder said Salesforce’s changes would include revamping office layouts to increase collaboration space instead of having a “sea of desks.” Mock-ups of its new offices feature café-style seating, open-air conference areas and private nooks, with an emphasis on clean desks and social distancing.<br />“We’re not going back to the way things were,” Mr. Hyder said in an interview. “I don’t believe that we’ll keep every space in every city that we’re in, including San Francisco.”<br />Salesforce expects more than 65% of its workforce to come into the office only one to three days a week in the future, up from 40% before the pandemic. An unspecified number of additional employees would be fully remote.<br />The company is the largest private employer in San Francisco and occupies the city’s tallest building, known as Salesforce Tower, and others with similar names in cities including Indianapolis, New York and Chicago. The company declined to say how much its real-estate footprint might shrink as a result of its changes.</td>

      <td>The company behind “Cyberpunk 2077” said its internal systems were breached in a cyberattack and the purported hacker threatened to release the software code underpinning the blockbuster videogame and other works in progress, a disclosure that sent its stock tumbling and presented a fresh challenge for the embattled developer.<br />CD Projekt SA  on Tuesday said an unidentified hacker accessed its internal network and collected corporate data in what the company described as a targeted attack. The company said it has begun restoring the data and that its backups remain intact, though some network devices remained encrypted. The compromised systems didn’t contain personal data of its players or users of its services, the Polish company said.<br />The hacker left a ransom note in CD Projekt’s system, the company said. In the undated note, a copy of which CD Projekt posted on Twitter, the hacker threatened to sell or leak videogame source codes and internal documents if the company didn’t come to an agreement with the hacker. The hacker gave the company 48 hours to contact them, according to the note.<br />“We have dumped FULL copies of the source codes from your Perforce server for Cyberpunk 2077, Witcher 3, Gwent and the unreleased version of Witcher 3!!!” the note said. “We have also dumped all of your documents relating to accounting, administration, legal, HR, investor relations and more!”<br />CD Projekt shares fell about 5% in Warsaw trading. A CD Projekt representative declined to comment on what means the hacker used to gain access to systems and data. It isn’t immediately clear whether the hack actually obtained code for CD Projekt’s games.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Wall Street’s main regulator will give more power to its enforcement staff to launch investigations, an early sign that it plans to become more assertive under the Biden administration.<br />The move by the Securities and Exchange Commission allows more enforcement supervisors to authorize investigations, permitting about 36 senior officials at the agency to subpoena companies and individuals for records or testimony. The agency during the Trump administration withdrew that authority from supervisors and allowed only two officials to approve new probes, saying it would result in more consistent decisions about which tips and complaints justified investigations.<br />“Returning this authority to the division’s experienced senior officers, who have a proven track record of executing it prudently, helps to ensure that investigative staff can work effectively to protect investors,” SEC acting Chair Allison Herren Lee said Tuesday.<br />The number of new investigations fell every year during the Trump administration, from 1,063 in 2016 to 827 in 2019, according to the most recent figures published by the SEC. The number of completed enforcement actions fell from 548 in 2016 to 405 in 2020, although it reached 526 in 2019.<br />Ms. Lee, who took over the agency last month when former Chairman Jay Claytonstepped down, earlier worked as an enforcement attorney based in the agency’s Denver office.

      <td>Setting policy at the state level seems to work better than letting cities jockey.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial will attract most of the attention this week, but perhaps the more important event for the country is the saga of Covid-19 vaccinations. The federal distribution of doses to the states hasn’t been an outright disaster, and neither have state efforts to put these doses into arms. After a slow start, there have been signs of progress in recent weeks. Still, governments could be doing better, and fixing what’s wrong can save many lives.<br />At the federal level, the main problems have been shifting information and poor advice to the states. On Jan. 12, for example, governors were told by then-Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar that the Trump administration would be releasing its stockpile of reserved doses. Relying on this assurance, many governors announced that their states would begin inoculating residents 65 and older. But it turned out that there was no stockpile to release, and governors had to change course.<br />Such shifts undermine public confidence and can lead to bad policy. In early January, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said that residents 65 to 74 would probably have to wait until March to get vaccinated. Then, according to a Washington Post report, Robert Redfield, who was director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, went to Annapolis and urged Mr. Hogan to start vaccinating seniors immediately. President Biden’s incoming coronavirus czar, Jeffrey Zients, reinforced this suggestion.<br />In response, Mr. Hogan announced that Marylanders 75 and older could start getting vaccinated immediately, followed a week later by those 65 to 74. This quadrupled the state’s eligible pool to more than two million, about 25 times the state’s weekly allotment of doses. The result, predictably, was a public-relations nightmare, as seniors tried to register for vaccinations that they had no realistic prospect of receiving.<br />As residents of Maryland and other states know, trying to sign up to get vaccinated takes residents to a bewildering multiplicity of online portals ranging from state and local public websites to hospitals and medical centers, pharmacies, and even supermarkets with clinics. Much of this confusion is the result of a federal failure that went unreported until recently.</td>

If Albany lawmakers get their way, however, the center of the global financial industry may need to find a new home.<br />On Wednesday, with more than 25 other representatives of New York’s securities industry, I sent a letter to state legislative leaders cautioning against the unintended consequences of imposing a transfer tax on stock sales. History’s lesson is clear: If you try to squeeze more revenue from financial firms, the business goes elsewhere.<br />The modern NYSE traces its origins to the time when New York City was the nation’s capital but not yet the financial capital of the world. Amsterdam held that title before surrendering the torch to London in the early 1800s. New York, and the U.S. more broadly, has been the center of global financial power since the end of World War II, but it shouldn’t take its position for granted.<br />Most of the original NYSE listings were New York-based companies, their shares traded by New York-based brokers. Now, the companies and the brokers are global, connected electronically through out-of-state servers, transacting their business instantaneously. These global companies want the NYSE to serve them in the most efficient, least expensive way possible. We’ve proved, by pandemic-driven necessity, that we can close the physical trading floor on a moment’s notice and maintain service without missing a beat. Similarly, the broader financial-services industry shuttered offices and shifted workforces, without hiccups, to remote locations.</td>

The Trump administration blocked the company from accessing American technology and sought to persuade allies that Huawei’s telecom gear presented national security risks.<br />Huawei’s lawsuit said the FCC’s ruling in December exceeded its authority and was “arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and not supported by substantial evidence.”<br />An FCC spokeswoman said, “Last year the FCC issued a final designation identifying Huawei as a national security threat based on a substantial body of evidence developed by the FCC and numerous U.S. national security agencies. We will continue to defend that decision.”</td>

      <td>With barely a week to spare until spring training starts, Major League Baseball has decided what the rules of the sport are going to be this season.<br />MLB and its players’ union reached an agreement on updated health and safety protocols that will govern baseball’s second pandemic season. The deal brings back a couple of experimental features from the truncated 2020 campaign: seven-inning doubleheaders and beginning all extra innings with a runner on second base.<br />But, at least as of now, the National League will not use the designated hitter in 2021 as it did last year. The expanded playoff format from 2020 will not return, either. Both ideas could well be part of baseball’s next collective bargaining agreement, however.<br />The new rules that are sticking around were implemented to keep games short and accommodate the anticipated spate of postponements caused by positive coronavirus tests.<br />The revamped extra-innings format is designed to prevent the marathons that ravage bullpens and often require upward of four hours to finish. This rule had the intended effect during last year’s 60-game slate: About 71% of all extra-inning games last year ended after just one additional frame and only 2.6% needed more than three. In 2019, 18% of extra-inning games went on beyond the 12th.</td>

      <td>Many questions hang over  Apple Inc.’s  car project, but one thing is increasingly clear: The project won’t fail for lack of credible production partners.<br />Nissan  is the latest car maker to signal its openness to a deal. As technology transforms the auto industry, “we need to take new initiatives” and “work with companies that are knowledgeable, with good experience, through partnership and collaboration,” said Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida on Tuesday. This was in response to a question about his willingness to partner with Apple at a press conference to discuss the Japanese car maker’s quarterly results.<br />Speculation about the established automotive industry’s role in an Apple car project has spread since Hyundai dropped the big news that it was in talks with the iPhone maker last month. On Monday, those discussions seemed to have broken down, but Hyundai’s stock is still up 23% this year. Apple might not rely on just one supplier, though, and has also held discussions with Japanese manufacturers, according to a report in the Nikkei newspaper last week.<br />Nissan stock has rallied in recent days. There was little in its quarterly results to justify the excitement: The company’s turnaround is moving forward, but it nonetheless downgraded its revenue expectations for its fiscal year through March, noting the global semiconductor shortage. Yet Nissan, among the Japanese auto makers, is “the most likely candidate to be in serious discussions with Apple,” according to Mio Kato, an equity analyst who publishes on the Smartkarma research platform. Having overexpanded in the U.S. in recent years, Nissan has spare capacity to fill.<br />It is far too early for investors to be betting on car-manufacturing contracts from Apple. Unlike smartphones, vehicles are safety-critical devices. Self-driving technology—a common feature in reports on Apple’s car project—is still in its infancy. Returns from companies involved in the smartphone supply chain have also been very volatile. Those who buy auto stocks for the Apple halo alone are setting themselves up for disappointment.</td>

      <td>Over-reliance on TSMC and soaring cost of old gear limits capacity expansion</td>
      <td>The production shortage plaguing the market for automotive chips is a combination of new and old problems, none of which can be easily solved.<br />Ford Motor  last week was the latest auto maker to show the fallout. The company said Thursday that it is cutting production by up to 20% in the first quarter due to its inability to procure enough chips. Rival General Motors said a day earlier that it planned to trim production at North American factories due to the shortage.  Volkswagen  sounded an early warning in December about the issue, which is affecting auto makers across the board that need chips to control everything from infotainment systems to power management to systems monitoring.<br />The problem stems from actions both recent and distant. A sudden drop-off in sales caused auto manufacturers to cut component orders early in the pandemic. Then demand rebounded at an unfortunate time as chip manufacturers were operating at capacity to produce components for hot, high-price items such as the latest generation of iPhones and artificial intelligence chips for data centers. Industry giant  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ,  or TSMC, said in its earnings call last month that the automotive market accounted for only 3% of its revenue in the fourth quarter compared with 51% for smartphones and 31% for high-performance computing chips.<br />The firm said on the same call that improving production for auto chips is a “top priority.” But the harsh reality is that chips for cars have to compete for manufacturing space with other products that generate a much higher return.  Nvidia ,  a major TSMC customer, sells some of its latest gaming processors for several hundred dollars apiece, whereas many of the microcontrollers used in the world’s automobiles can fetch a dollar or less. Even cheap chips can have expensive consequences, though. Stephen Sanghi, chief executive of auto chip supplier  Microchip Technology ,  noted in his own call last week that “a $1 part can prevent a $40,000 car from shipping.”<br />Chip fabrication plants generally take more than two years to set up and the soaring cost of building and equipping them has led more semiconductor companies to outsource more of their production needs. Renesas, NXP and  Infineon -Cypress, which together account for nearly 80% of the automotive chip market, all use TSMC for some of their manufacturing. The Taiwanese firm now produces about 70% of the microcontroller units used in the world’s automobiles, estimates Phil Amsrud of  IHS Markit .</td>

      <td>Total’s prudent management in recent years set it up well for the trauma of 2020</td>
      <td>French giant Total may be the best of a bad bunch in the unloved oil-and-gas sector.<br />The company weathered a traumatic year for the oil industry better than European peers  Shell  and  BP ,  annual results released Tuesday confirmed. The sector isn’t for the faint of heart as the world transitions to cleaner forms of energy, but Total seems well set up for a range of scenarios.<br />The company is the second-largest producer of liquefied natural gas, and added significant finds to its oil and gas reserves last year. Yet it is also developing a new-energy business. It has converted some refineries to biodiesel and is investing in renewable assets. It has trading and retail services, and is dabbling in batteries, electric-vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon-capture technologies.<br />So much activity could raise the risk of poor delivery, but Total’s results have been steady so far. It has the advantages of low production costs and a solid balance sheet. The company has been buying businesses in various industries around the globe for years, but resisted overextending itself, as Shell did with the 2016 purchase of BG Group. It also hasn’t had to digest the vast cost of large oil spills, as BP did with the disasters in Alaska in 2006 and the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.<br />Investors used to prize oil companies for their stable and growing dividends. Both Shell and BP cut their payouts as the pandemic hit oil demand, but Total didn’t and now offers a sector-leading 7.5% dividend yield. The payments are sustainable at a $40 a barrel oil price, management said.</td>

      <td>Last year, after the pandemic hit, New York City’s startup scene went quiet—for about a month. Then it went into overdrive. In 2020, local startup funding broke records. Depending on which report you read, investors injected between $12 billion and $20 billion into area startup companies.<br />So what’s getting funded in New York these days? Better to ask what isn’t getting funded. Among the rounds that closed in 2020: $47 million for a hair-loss-prevention service, $9 million for a company making human-grade cat food, $6.25 million for a podcast company focusing on romantic comedies and $150,000 for a maker of bathroom-cleaning robots.<br />And thanks to a big wave of IPOs and acquisitions, local venture capitalists and angel investors are swimming in cash and likely to continue the funding frenzy this year.<br />So here’s what I’m wondering: How can I get me some of that loot?<br />I asked industry insiders for tips. The good news: You don’t need to be a tech type, it seems, to impress a New York City VC. While the San Francisco Bay Area startup scene is dominated by nerds, startup founders in New York look a lot like, well, the rest of us. The people who get funding here often are escapees from industries such as finance, real estate, health care and retail.</td>

      <td>A trillion here, a trillion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money. A fierce argument has erupted between well-known left-leaning economists about President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package, with warnings that it is so large it risks runaway inflation and the crowding out of other, more productive, spending plans.<br />The concerns being voiced by Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary to Bill Clinton and director of Barack Obama’s National Economic Council, and Olivier Blanchard, former IMF chief economist, are perfectly reasonable arguments. After all, it comes just weeks after a $900 billion stimulus by the departing president.<br />Yet, markets show no sign of concern, either in the average expectation of inflation implied by the bond market or the likelihood of very high inflation in the options market, both of which are merely back to where they stood in 2018.<br />Investors are predicting the sort of inflation they like, slightly higher in the next few years but moderating back down after that, and it’s helping stocks and commodities while limiting the pain to bondholders from rising yields.<br />Investors have four reasons to take comfort that are at least as good as Messrs. Summers and Blanchard’s reasons for concern.</td>

      <td>The pandemic has sparked partisan anger and mistrust between lawmakers in Harrisburg</td>
      <td>HARRISBURG, Pa.—Republican Doug Mastriano was a little over a year into his first term as a state senator when the coronavirus pandemic struck. He assailed the Democratic governor’s business closures and mask mandates, raising his profile in the process. He is now considering a run for governor next year.<br />State Sen. Jim Brewster, a Democrat, urged people to follow health guidelines and government rules, a stance he said nearly cost him his seat last November. A frequent party-crosser during his 10 years in office, he said the pandemic has changed how he views his fellow lawmakers. “I’m done working with people who have an agenda,” he said.<br />The public-health crisis approaching the one-year mark upended how Americans live. It has also deepened the divide between Republicans and Democrats at the national level, polls have shown, and in Pennsylvania, an electoral battleground where control of state government is split between the parties. That partisanship worsened after many locally elected Republicans supported former President Donald Trump’s unfounded assertions that the election was stolen from him.<br />“It was the perfect storm—an election year, people’s lives turned upside down from the long pandemic of things,” said state Rep. Torren Ecker, a Republican who represents part of south-central Pennsylvania. “It’s all led to some tension, to say the least.”<br />Politicians from both parties believe the rift started at the top: Republicans say Democrats focused on the pandemic as a way to make Mr. Trump look bad and went too far in placing restrictions on businesses. Democrats say Republicans followed Mr. Trump’s lead and didn’t take the virus seriously enough and pushed to prematurely reopen the economy.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—The jets that landed in Australia from China were made to look inconspicuous: no corporate logos to indicate that wealthy gamblers were inside.<br />According to a report released by an Australian regulator Tuesday, it was a deliberate attempt by an executive at Australian casino operator  Crown Resorts Ltd.  to evade the Chinese government, which in early 2015 had announced a crackdown on foreign casinos recruiting Chinese high-rollers to gamble overseas.<br />The plan didn’t work, and Chinese police later arrested 19 Crown employees, accusing them of gambling-related crimes. Tuesday’s report said Crown disregarded the welfare of its employees in China by pursuing lucrative high-rollers even as the Chinese police were closing in, and concluded that Crown isn’t suitable to hold a license for a new casino in Sydney without making significant changes to its corporate culture.<br />The 751-page report, based on 60 days of public hearings that included Crown executives, offers an unusually in-depth look at the inner workings of an industry that has a reputation for being anything but transparent. The report  also found that bank accounts at Crown’s subsidiaries were used to launder money. In addition, Crown worked with so-called junket operators in Asia to bring high-rollers to Australia, even after learning of allegations in media reports and the company’s own due diligence that those groups had ties to organized crime, the report said.<br />As early as 2014, Crown’s bankers raised warnings of suspicious deposits in its bank accounts, such as multiple deposits on the same day by the same person at different branches in the same city, the report said. But Crown at the time didn’t change how the bank accounts operated or were monitored, the report said. Account details were given to Crown patrons, whose deposits would be credited to their account at the relevant casino.</td>

      <td>BERLIN—Germans with foreign roots are increasingly voting for the center-right, providing a new pool of voters for the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the country’s social fabric becomes increasingly diverse and traditional political allegiances dissolve with integration.<br />This could have significant political implications for the country, which was home to the largest group of migrants in the world—13 million—in 2019, just behind the U.S., according to the United Nations. It also shows how decades of immigration into Europe has transformed the continent’s demographics and is reshaping politics in unexpected ways.<br />The finding, in a new study by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a think tank linked to Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union shows a majority of people of migrant origin in the country favor conservative, free-market or even far-right parties.<br />“We are seeing a process of normalization,” said Viola Neu, the author of the study. As migrants become economically and culturally more integrated, get naturalized and gain the right to vote, they tend to shift support from the center-left to the center-right, she said.<br />“People with immigrant backgrounds now vote like the majority does—not as a group tied to their origin, but according to their values and personal preferences,” she added.</td>

      <td>Some of the world’s biggest investors were on the cusp of a multibillion-dollar windfall from their bets on Ant Group Co. Now they are stuck with shares that won’t pay off soon.<br />In 2018, an exclusive group of global private-equity firms and mutual-fund managers including Silver Lake, Warburg Pincus LLC,  Carlyle Group Inc.  and  T. Rowe Price Group Inc.  took part in a coveted fundraising by Ant that raised $14 billion and minted the financial-technology giant as the world’s most valuable startup.<br />More than $10 billion of the money came from international investors, which bought shares in an offshore shell company set up by Ant to raise funds in U.S. dollars. The unusual arrangement came about because in order to secure a payment license to operate Alipay, its highly popular mobile app, Ant had to be domiciled in mainland China. But that also limited the company’s ability to raise funds directly from foreign investors.<br />The global investors agreed to terms that were highly favorable to Ant, and which limited their ability to cash out if the company didn’t end up going public, according to people familiar with the matter. Ant also didn’t provide a listing time frame or guarantee investors a return while it stayed private, the people added.<br />The foreign investors didn’t receive any voting rights in Ant, which was valued at $150 billion in the June 2018 deal. None was given a seat on Ant’s board.</td>

The firm forecasts £48 billion, equivalent to about $66 billion, worth of investment this year, up 30% from £37 billion in 2020.<br />Colliers International  is a bit more bullish, predicting commercial property investment in the U.K. will accelerate by 36%.</td>

      <td>Pandemic is accelerating the end of the industry’s lease-and-sublet model, some suggest</td>
      <td>The pandemic is compelling a number of co-working firms to discard original business models, or accelerate the adoption of a new one, with the broader office market under threat.<br />The original strategy, popularized by WeWork and many of its peers, involved leasing as much office space in city centers as possible, and then effectively subletting it to companies for a profit. This approach led to spectacular growth and sent WeWork’s valuation soaring to $47 billion.<br />With the majority of office employees still working from home during Covid-19, demand has plummeted. But co-working firms remain on the hook for the expensive long-term leases they signed during the boom years, and many are struggling to meet these obligations. Knotel Inc. became the industry’s biggest victim yet of this mismatch when it filed for Chapter-11 bankruptcy last month.<br />Now, some analysts suggest the pandemic is accelerating the end of the industry’s lease-and-sublet model. “The business model was similar to picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, which history has shown isn’t a sustainable strategy,” said Daniel Ismail, a senior analyst at research firm Green Street.<br />Instead, he expects revenue-sharing agreements to become more common. They are similar to the relationship between hotel owners and operators, where operators get fees and a share of profits but don’t have to pay rent. Revenue-sharing deals are considered less risky because they leave operators with lower fixed costs.</td>

      <td>In a daring, high-speed swan dive from space, the first interplanetary probe from an Arab nation will attempt to enter orbit around Mars on Tuesday, to be followed closely in coming days by ambitious missions to the red planet from the U.S. and China.<br />The United Arab Emirates’ 1.5-ton, SUV-size satellite, called al-Amal, or Hope, carries three sensors designed to make the first comprehensive weather observations across the planet’s surface. The $200 million mission is the keystone of a national effort to make science and technology mainstays of the small Gulf state’s economy in anticipation of a day when its oil revenues dwindle, U.A.E. officials said.<br />“It’s about stimulating a lot of change within the U.A.E.’s economy that today more than ever should have a solid foundation in science,” said Sarah al-Amiri, Emirati minister of state for advanced sciences and chair of the U.A.E. Space Agency. “The best way to do that, from what we have been experimenting with as a nation, has been an exploration mission to space.”<br />In the most critical moment of its 306 million mile journey from Earth, which began in July with the launch of a Japanese rocket that lofted it into space, the Hope spacecraft on Tuesday was scheduled to fire its onboard thrusters for 27 minutes to reach a stable orbit around Mars. The maneuver was to be controlled autonomously by onboard computers, because the 22-minute time lag in radio transmissions between the craft and Earth made ground control impossible.<br />“It’s the first time we actually use all six thrusters and our whole control system,” mission project manager Omran Sharaf at the Emirates’ Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre in Dubai said in advance of the maneuver. “My feelings? Very very nervous. Extremely nervous. Worried. Scared. But I am also confident. Happy. Proud.”</td>

But they might need to do some spending of their own, too.<br />As credit measures continue to perform much better than feared, with still-low delinquency rates and rising loan-loss provision releases, investors seem to have found another reason to be worried about banks: their noninterest expenses. Fourth-quarter expenses at the very largest banks as a percentage of revenue rose by 3 points year over year on a median basis, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group. Out of 24 large banks’ earnings tracked by Autonomous Research, analysts’ consensus forecasts for 2021 expenses have risen for 22. Higher costs eat away at preprovision net revenue, which is already depressed by low interest rates and tepid loan growth.<br />It is true that banks have had their cost issues, highlighted recently by the recent focus on financial-crime monitoring, plus a continuing surge of fintech competition that forces banks to continually beef up their technology. But investors still may not be best served over the longer term by being too focused on margins right now, especially amid the earnings noise of the pandemic and its related effects. Certain spending today might be the key to outperformance in the post-pandemic future.<br />Card companies, in particular, ought to be viewed over a longer time horizon, given depressed customer spending in key categories such as travel. Take  American Express ,  for example: Falling expenses that vary with customer activity offset around 40% of the decline in the company’s revenue in the fourth quarter, down from about 50% earlier in 2020, the company said in January. But part of what was behind that smaller offset was an increased use of cardholder benefits—a sign that even as many spenders may not be doing the kind of shopping on travel and entertainment they once were, they still get value out of their cards. That is a possible sign of pent-up demand and a longer-term return to normal card behavior.<br />Likewise,  Capital One Financial  might look much more efficient at higher consumer-activity levels. The company said in January that some of its technology investment was aimed at more effective customer marketing, and it outlined a strategy of generating more new accounts now, with the longer-term aim of giving customers larger credit lines in a better economy. Credit cards are a rare kind of lending in which margins can stay strong even amid low rates, so banks will need to do a lot of it as demand returns.</td>

      <td>Panel of five judges rules lower court was wrong to free the media mogul, raising the bar for bail in national-security cases</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—Hong Kong’s highest court has denied bail to pro-democracy newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai, the most prominent figure facing prosecution under a sweeping national-security law imposed by Beijing to silence opposition after a year of unrest.<br />The ruling means that Mr. Lai could potentially spend the rest of his life behind bars if convicted. The businessman and longtime critic of China’s Communist Party is charged with foreign collusion, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The decision also signals that courts will set a high standard for granting bail to anyone charged under the national-security law.<br />Mr. Lai, who is in his early 70s, is among a handful of defendants heading to trial under a law imposed last year—and was the only one so far that a judge had released on bail pending trial. His case is being watched closely in mainland China and in Hong Kong as a test of how the law will be enforced in the former British colony, which has largely governed itself and retained its U.K.-style legal system since its return to China in 1997.<br />China’s state-backed media reacted with outrage in December after a lower-court judge granted bail to Mr. Lai shortly after his arrest. Mr. Lai also faces a fraud charge. He denies the charges.<br />China’s Communist Party mouthpiece The People’s Daily called Mr. Lai dangerous and castigated local courts for misreading the national-security law, which sets strict conditions for bail. The column suggested mainland authorities might invoke new powers under the law to pull Mr. Lai’s case out of Hong Kong’s legal system and try him in the mainland.</td>

      <td>With more shopping moving online for good, retailers introduce new tools to rein in costly returns; 3-D body scans</td>
      <td>The surge in pandemic-fueled online shopping has created a new urgency to solve a decades-old problem: returns.<br />Companies such as  Walmart Inc.  and  Amazon.com Inc.  are telling customers to keep unwanted items. Some retailers are introducing virtual dressing rooms and made-to-measure clothing so that shoppers keep more of what they buy. Others are scoring shoppers based on their return rates, much the way credit-ratings firms tally consumers’ creditworthiness.<br />Behind the push is a painful economic reality of e-commerce. The share of online purchases that are returned averages 30% or higher, depending on the category, three times the rate in physical stores, according to industry executives.<br />“There was a huge shift to online shopping, and the numbers won’t go back to where they were before the pandemic,” said Oliver Lange, who runs H&Mbeyond, the brand’s innovation lab.<br />Consumers got comfortable buying everything from groceries to makeup online, as brick-and-mortar stores temporarily shut and anxiety mounted about spending time indoors. In a recent survey by technology company  Pitney Bowes ,  42% of consumers said they plan to shop even more online once the pandemic ends than they do now.</td>

      <td>The number of help-wanted ads returned to pre-pandemic levels in January, particularly among industries that have weathered the pandemic relatively well, a sign that hiring could pick up from its sluggish pace at the start of the year.<br />Available jobs on job-search site Indeed were up 0.7% at the end of January from Feb. 1, 2020, according to the company’s measure of job posting trends. The number of postings to the site has grown since hitting a low in May, though the pace of new openings has slowed in recent months, Indeed said.<br />Industries that recovered quickly from the initial shock of the pandemic have led growth in job openings, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed. Those industries—such as warehousing, construction and delivery services—have held steady over the course of the pandemic.<br />Meanwhile higher-wage postings in technology and finance have recently picked up. “I think those are sectors that hire based on where they see the economy going longer term.” Mr. Kolko said. “Restaurants, beauty-and -wellness jobs and hair salons will hire pretty quickly if demand picks up but also might lay off people quickly. Higher-wage sectors hire and fire more slowly.”<br />The Labor Department on Tuesday will separately release its job openings data for December.</td>
