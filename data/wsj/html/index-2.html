      <td>Memo advised a co-owner to keep assets overseas to protect against litigation</td>
      <td>In July 2007, a few months after Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to federal charges of misleading the public about the addictive risks of OxyContin, a confidential memo warned one of the company’s owners that its assets are best protected overseas.<br />The family-owned company faced “uncapped liabilities” and had to protect itself from the risk of a wave of lawsuits akin to the decadeslong asbestos litigation, said the memo, written by Peter Boer, then an adviser to Jonathan Sackler, the Purdue co-owner and a board member.<br />“For the family, it may be that overseas assets with limited transparency and jurisdictional shielding from U.S. judgments will be less attractive to litigants than domestic assets,” Mr. Boer wrote in the memo to Mr. Sackler, analyzing a possible sale of Purdue.<br />The memo by Mr. Boer, who joined Purdue’s board in 2008 and remains a director, is among hundreds of emails and other corporate documents recently unsealed in Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy case at the request of The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations represented by attorneys at the nonprofit Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.<br />A committee of Purdue creditors investigating the Sacklers says the records supply evidence for their probe into whether Sackler family members unlawfully moved $10.3 billion in profits out of the company from 2008 to 2017 to thwart future judgments, an allegation the Sacklers deny. Purdue is trying to resolve those lawsuits through bankruptcy.</td>

In return, the Justice Department agreed to drop an objection it filed in the Westmoreland case alleging McKinsey’s disclosures were legally insufficient.<br />The settlement is the latest in several multimillion-dollar deals in recent years tied to questions about McKinsey’s disclosure practices. Bankruptcy advisers legally are required to be disinterested and to disclose connections that could give rise to a conflict of interest.<br />“It is my hope that McKinsey management is able to implement changes that make a difference,” said Judge David Jones of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, who oversaw the Westmoreland case and related disclosure litigation.</td>

But the Apple CEO, he said, “refused to take the meeting.”<br />Mr. Musk revealed the latest detail as he questioned the seriousness of Apple’s plans to bring out an electric car of its own, amid a new report the company is pushing for 2024 production.<br />On Twitter, Mr. Musk called the report “strange, if true.”<br />Tesla has built a brand for itself as a Silicon Valley auto maker offering high-tech cars with promises of fully self-driving technology on the near horizon. The specter of a driverless, electric car made by tech giant Apple could prove the kind of fierce competition that traditional auto makers, such as General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG, have yet to muster.</td>

Joe Biden called it a mere “down payment” and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it is “a first step.” They want bailouts for the states in particular, even as the latest Census report shows states are doing far better than they claim.<br />States are also doing very well in this latest Covid bill. Start with the $26 billion for transit agencies, airports and shovel-ready public works. This will help New York’s transit and port authorities reduce their financial holes.<br />There’s also $22 billion for the states for Covid testing and contact tracing, though insurers and the feds cover the cost of tests. States will use it for more budget backfill. The Los Angeles Times reported last month that 25 LA County firefighters had made more than $100,000 on average in overtime by ferrying test supplies, most of which was reimbursed by federal Cares Act funds.<br />Education will get a whopping $82 billion, about $54 billion of which will go to K-12 schools though many are closed and employ fewer staff. That’s about as much as the federal government spends on K-12 in a normal year. The bill also provides $3.2 billion for broadband for low-income families, so public schools don’t have to pay for that.<br />States will also benefit from the federal enhanced $300 weekly unemployment benefits, which are taxable income in most states.  The jobless benefit sweetener will especially help states with higher unemployment such as New Jersey (10.2%), Hawaii (10.1%), New York (8.4%), Connecticut (8.2%) and California (8.2%).</td>

      <td>An Iowa candidate asks Democrats not to seat the Republican winner.</td>
      <td>How bloody-minded will Democrats be with their precariously thin House majority? We’re about to find out as Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s caucus considers an election challenge from Iowa’s 2nd Congressional district.<br />On Nov. 30, Iowa certified Republican candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks the winner of the district, which extends southeast of Des Moines and is currently held by a Democrat. The margin was six votes.<br />On Tuesday Democrat Rita Hart submitted a brief asking the House of Representatives to overturn that outcome. Authored by Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias, it says counting 22 mostly absentee ballots would give Ms. Hart a nine-vote lead. The brief asks the House to order another recount and use its constitutional authority to seat Ms. Hart instead.<br />Among the reasons the ballots were wrongly excluded, the brief says, are signature placement, envelope seal and timeliness. Ms. Miller-Meeks’s campaign must file a response, which could raise other ballot disputes, within 30 days. Her campaign said in a statement: “Congresswoman-elect Mariannette Miller-Meeks won the vote on election night, won the 24-county audit and official canvas, won the 24-county recount, and was unanimously certified by the State of Iowa as the winner of the election by a bipartisan council.”<br />One political vulnerability for the Hart campaign is that it did not exhaust its Iowa court challenges before asking the House to intervene. The campaign said there wasn’t time for judicial relief in the one-week window between certification and the Dec. 8 deadline for a five-member state “contest court” ruling. But if only 22 ballots are at issue, the complaint could have been presented to Iowa judges.</td>

      <td>Gen. Perna has presided over vaccine delivery that is a great success.</td>
      <td>‘I failed, nobody else failed.” You don’t hear that often, or ever, from a government official. But that’s what Operation Warp Speed logistics chief Gen. Gustave Perna said Saturday by way of apologizing to states for shipping fewer  Pfizer  Covid vaccine doses than expected. Kudos to Gen. Perna—and all the more so since overall the vaccine rollout is a historic success.<br />Close collaboration between government and private industry has made a vaccine available in record time and now is proving essential to distribution logistics. The military has been charged with coordinating distribution with states and private companies across a long supply chain including drug makers, airlines, freight companies, pharmacies, hospitals and nursing homes.<br />All of this involves meticulous planning, which has been in the works since early spring. Operation Warp Speed accelerated vaccine development by removing financial risk for drug makers and helping them line up facilities to manufacture vaccine candidates and sites to conduct trials. It has also accelerated and facilitated distribution.<br />Drug makers usually wait until their vaccines are approved before buying raw materials and establishing manufacturing lines and supply chains. Operation Warp Speed worked with and provided funding for drug makers to do all of this months ahead of time. So once vaccines are approved, shipments can begin immediately.<br />Pfizer has done most of the logistical groundwork for its vaccine, which is especially tricky because it must be transported and stored at ultra-cold temperatures. There are multiple steps from manufacturing to inoculation including final-assembly and storage sites. Pfizer has planned dozens of cargo flights and hundreds of truck trips every day.</td>

      <td>A new rule will help traders access vital price information.</td>
      <td>A fight over the data fees that trading firms pay stock exchanges has grown tense, and trading firms have been calling for back up. The Securities and Exchange Commission has had mixed success lately in its search for the best ways to lower barriers for traders. But its rule on data infrastructure will expand access to key trading information while remaining within its authority.<br />Finalized this month, the rule mandates that exchanges such as Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange publish more detailed live trading data on their public data feeds. These feeds report last-sale quotations for each listed stock, but they omit other data that allow traders to gauge a stock’s momentum, such as recent offers made above and below the current sale price. Public feeds also lag behind the pace of trading, making it hard for traders who track prices to execute profitably in today’s high-speed market.<br />Trading firms and the SEC say the shoddiness of public data is part of the exchanges’ plan. To access quick, quality stock info, firms must subscribe to any of the increasing number of premium feeds that NYSE, Nasdaq and the  Chicago Board Options Exchange  now offer. The SEC found that, from 2010 to 2018, traders’ data fees increased anywhere from 967% to 2,916% depending on their business model. A typical midsize firm might now pay $3 million annually for its live stock price data, before additional transaction fees.<br />In addition to beefing up the public feeds, the new rule will expand the range of data that exchanges must send to other publishers of stock price info. These “competing consolidators” sell analysis of stock fluctuations to traders, often for lower fees than the exchanges charge for their premium feeds. The SEC will also require exchanges to publish sale prices for smaller lots of certain high-price stocks, providing a more useful guide for traders who deal in small volumes.<br />The new rule comes six months after the SEC took a pair of losses in previous attempts to regulate the exchanges. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in June struck down the agency’s plan to study the market by temporarily adjusting certain exchange fees and rebates. The court also blocked the SEC’s move to roll back exchanges’ fee increases once they’re already in place.</td>

      <td>Cardona will face pressure to abandon charter schools, one of the few government innovations that work.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden has chosen an education secretary who may be open to reforms that enhance student achievement, even at the cost of ruffling feathers in the education bureaucracy. Miguel Cardona, Connecticut’s education commissioner, pressed to get children back in school while teachers unions wanted them closed. Rather than follow the “college or bust” monomania, he has urged equal support for children “who need hands-on experiences, who want to build things, who want to manufacture.”<br />Dacia Toll, CEO of the Achievement First charter-school network that operates in Connecticut, says of Mr. Cardona: “I haven’t found him to be driven by ideology and politics. He is more focused on making sure every kid gets an excellent education than the type of school they go to.”<br />Let’s hope he can maintain that evenhandedness, taste for excellence, and openness to reform. For if Mr. Cardona ends up running the Education Department, he will face heavy pressure to focus less on children and more on what is politically expedient. Advocates surrounding him will demand lots more money for the status quo and an end to disruption of existing K-12 systems.<br />If a Secretary Cardona does choose to resist, he’ll have evidence on his side. People who demand more spending on social programs love to chatter about “evidence based” policy making. Follow the science! goes the familiar cry. Alas, this sloganeering is often lip service.<br />One sad reality about “evidence-based social policy” is that astonishingly few interventions show any proof that they work. Beginning in 2001, some very smart economists and social scientists worked for more than a decade to build the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy. These careful investigators reviewed many hundreds of academic assessments, and commissioned some original ones of their own. In the end, they were able to identify only 12 domestic programs that clearly helped the population they were aimed at. Another 16 programs showed partial signs of effectiveness, and 31 more had outcomes that were somewhat encouraging though indefinite. That was it. After decades of interventions consuming billions of dollars, a grand total of 59 programs could demonstrate any positive effect.</td>

      <td>A policy aimed at conspiracy theories could hit scientific brainstorming.</td>
      <td>Facebook has announced a policy to “remove false claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips, or anything else that isn’t on the official vaccine ingredient list.” This seems reasonable, until you think through the details.<br />One difficulty is that banning discussion is a terrible way to counter a conspiracy theory; the censorship is seen as further evidence of a conspiracy. Better to acknowledge the facts and test the theory’s plausibility. Radio-frequency identification chips can be as narrow as 0.15 millimeter, small enough to fit through the 25-gauge needle used for vaccinations. But objects that size can be seen with the naked eye. Thousands of medical personnel have administered the vaccines, and none have reported little black objects floating in the bottles. Further, how could one microchip per person be extracted from a single bottle containing multiple doses? And why would anyone bother to tag people now that we all carry cellphones with unique identifiers?<br />The notion that there are microchips in vaccines is a ridiculous conspiracy theory, best dealt with by facts, science, logic and ridicule, not censorship. But Facebook’s policy of restricting discussion to substances on the “official vaccine ingredient list” also hinders serious discussion of what is causing the rare allergic reactions to the  Pfizer  vaccine.<br />That inquiry has centered on one of the official ingredients, polyethylene glycol, which is very rarely an allergen. We should also consider the possibility of trace amounts of other allergens accompanying the officially listed ingredients. To assess this, I showed the ingredient list to a drug-formulation scientist, Chris Moreton. He responded that some of the lipid ingredients are typically derived from plants such as beans, and traces of proteins from these plants should be considered as potential causes of the allergic reactions. That is a forbidden thought on Facebook because bean protein isn’t on the official vaccine ingredients list.<br />Mr. Moreton and I are scientists, and Facebook’s policies would suppress our brainstorming. There are ways of dealing with such controversies without censorship. In science, we have journals, seminars and conferences in which all sorts of hypotheses are floated and assessed. We have a decentralized process by which good ideas can rise to the top.</td>

      <td>Section 230 has its flaws, but those are nothing compared with what Big Brother would bring.</td>
      <td>If you had told me 24 years ago that the internet pornography law I was working on would be the main obstacle to defense spending in 2020, I would have called you crazy. Yet for the past several weeks President Trump has repeatedly warned that he will veto the $740 billion defense appropriation bill if Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act isn’t repealed.<br />The congressional committee that drafted the 1996 act’s final language knew that Section 230 was a critical law at the dawn of the internet, and we passed it for a specific reason: to protect the internet’s role as a free marketplace of ideas. What went wrong? We succeeded too well.<br />In recent years, Section 230 has become a political punching bag, with some saying it allows big tech companies to censor political views, and others saying it enables the spread of disinformation. Nearly a quarter century ago, we couldn’t have anticipated today’s internet, where one private company,  Facebook ,  controls most of the public forums that Americans use to express their views, and another, Google, controls most of the information Americans receive when they search the internet.<br />We need to re-evaluate Section 230 in light of today’s very different internet. But there’s one thing we shouldn’t re-evaluate: the provision’s role in supporting and nurturing an open and free marketplace of ideas. Every election cycle, and almost every news cycle, reminds us how difficult it is to defend the free-speech rights of those with whom we disagree. Our tradition of free expression is threatened every day, and we must remain vigilant about preserving it.<br />Simply repealing Section 230 is the worst possible solution. If website owners are held liable for everything that appears on their platforms, they will have to create systems for reviewing and editing all posted content before it goes up. This is an impossible task. At best it would create an environment that allows only the most limited and inoffensive speech. At worst it would force operators to shut down many social-media sites and drastically limit the ability of private citizens to express views online. We would end up with a Kafkaesque process governed by tort lawyers, political correctness and hidden agendas. This isn’t the right solution for a free society.</td>

      <td>Justice Department accuses retail giant of ignoring warnings from its own pharmacists; complaint follows company’s suit to fight allegations pre-emptively</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Trump administration sued  Walmart Inc.  Tuesday, accusing the retail giant of helping to fuel the nation’s opioid crisis by inadequately screening for questionable prescriptions despite repeated warnings from its own pharmacists.<br />The Justice Department’s lawsuit claims Walmart sought to boost profits by understaffing its pharmacies and pressuring employees to fill prescriptions quickly. That made it difficult for pharmacists to reject invalid prescriptions, enabling widespread drug abuse nationwide, the suit alleges.<br />Walmart responded in a public filing Tuesday, saying the lawsuit “invents a legal theory that unlawfully forces pharmacists to come between patients and their doctors, and is riddled with factual inaccuracies and cherry-picked documents taken out of context.”<br />“Blaming pharmacists for not second-guessing the very doctors [the Drug Enforcement Administration] approved to prescribe opioids is a transparent attempt to shift blame from DEA’s well-documented failures in keeping bad doctors from prescribing opioids in the first place,” Walmart said, adding that it “always empowered our pharmacists to refuse to fill problematic opioids prescriptions, and they refused to fill hundreds of thousands of such prescriptions.”<br />The country’s largest retailer by revenue, Walmart has been expecting this complaint and sued the federal government in October to fight the allegations pre-emptively. That suit accuses the Justice Department and DEA of attempting to scapegoat the company for what it says are the federal government’s own regulatory and enforcement shortcomings.</td>

      <td>Government relief covers carriers’ payrolls through March, but rebound in air travel remains uncertain</td>
      <td>Airlines are preparing to call back tens of thousands of workers they let go in October now that Congress has approved government assistance to cover carriers’ payroll through the end of March. The question is how long employees will be able to keep their jobs.<br />The $900 billion relief package for households and businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic includes $15 billion for airlines to pay all their workers. Carriers are hoping—for the second time—that the government assistance will serve as a bridge through a rocky period.<br />Many travel executives believe there is pent-up demand for travel that could be unleashed next summer. If they are right, airlines will need as many pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and baggage handlers as they can get in order to keep up. Airlines furloughed over 32,000 workers in October when the government aid they received last spring ran out.<br />But a new strain of coronavirus in the United Kingdom has illustrated how quickly prospects for a recovery in travel could change. The strain has prompted a wave of travel restrictions in Europe and elsewhere, raising fresh questions about when borders will reopen and when people will be comfortable traveling again.<br />The funding bill, which President Trump is expected to sign, covers airline employees’ wages and benefits retroactively from Dec. 1 through the end of March, and bars airlines from furloughing or laying people off again during that period.</td>

      <td>Accusations by Texas and nine other states give ground to publishers’ frustrations that the digital-ad economy is rigged</td>
      <td>For more than a decade, Google assured publishers its online advertising tools were designed to help them make more money. Many were skeptical.<br />Last week, an antitrust lawsuit by Texas and nine other states against Google gave publishers’ frustrations a legal voice, alleging that the tech giant runs a digital advertising monopoly and rigs the market in its favor.<br />“One of the messages news publishers always get is, ‘Stop complaining. Google just has better ad products,’” said David Chavern, the president of the News Media Alliance, a news-publisher trade group. The suit showed “they also controlled everything about the market, and that has had really bad and profound effects on publishers,” he said.<br />Several publishers cooperated with the states to build a case, people familiar with the situation said, and much of the suit lines up with the complaints publishers have made about Google for several years.<br />Publishing executives say they were surprised by the volume of internal Google documentation included in the suit. Communications between Google employees, much of it redacted, suggest the employees were aware Google advertising tools didn’t always help publisher clients make more money than other ad tools, according to the suit.</td>

A generation later, the spirit of the Soviet Union has re-emerged with mass support in the U.S.<br />When I arrived in Moscow in 1976 to begin a six-year stint as a correspondent, I was struck by the red flags flying from government buildings and the somber streets devoid of advertising except for garish posters showing workers with clenched fists demanding an end to the arms race.<br />When the Soviet Union fell, it seemed the Soviet attempt to impose a deluded version of reality had died with it. Francis Fukuyama, in his 1989 essay “The End of History,” said that Marxism-Leninism was doomed as an alternative to liberal democracy. I argued at the time that the drive to make a religion out of politics had not disappeared.<br />For the past four years, potted histories have warned about the rise of fascism in the U.S. But the real danger is the transformation of “tolerance” into an ideology with its own courts, informers and punishments, all of them reminiscent of the Soviet Union.<br />One of the pillars of the Soviet Union was a controlled press in which all coverage was organized to confirm a mendacious ideology.</td>

      <td>The Covid relief package is welcome, but the new president will have to do more.</td>
      <td>The Covid-19 relief legislation Congress passed on Monday postpones—but doesn’t resolve—two questions, which the new Congress and the Biden administration will face early in 2021: How much should the federal government spend to mitigate the suffering Covid-19 has produced? And what must be done to avoid a double-dip recession and promote economic recovery?<br />The economy and society can’t return to normal until the pandemic recedes. This will take time, even with the development and approval of two new vaccines at a record pace. America is unlikely to reach the necessary level of immunization until summer at the earliest.<br />Meanwhile, states and localities are coping with record levels of infections and hospitalizations. Many are reimposing the restrictions they relaxed during the summer, dealing a new blow to entire industries. Restaurants are closing, travel is declining, and applications for unemployment insurance are on the rise again. After flattening in October, retail sales fell by 1.1% last month. The pace of job growth has declined for five straight months and may have ceased in December. Many families are facing hunger and eviction.<br />The new relief bill addresses the most urgent problems. Federal unemployment benefits have been extended until March 14, at a reduced but still significant level of $300 a week. In addition, individuals with less than $75,000 in annual income and couples making less than $150,000 will receive checks of $600 a person. Families with two children can receive up to $2,400.<br />Businesses will get help, mainly through the Paycheck Protection Program, which has been extended at a cost of $285 billion. New restrictions will ensure that payments go to small businesses as intended, and the program’s benefits will receive more-favorable tax treatment. Airlines will receive another round of help to limit layoffs.</td>

The Wall Street Journal reviewed part of a recent draft version of the suit without redactions, which elaborated on findings and allegations in the court documents.<br />Ten Republican attorneys general, led by Texas, are alleging that the two companies cut a deal in September 2018 in which Facebook agreed not to compete with Google’s online advertising tools in return for special treatment when it used them.<br />Google used language from “Star Wars” as a code name for the deal, according to the lawsuit, which redacted the actual name. The draft version of the suit says it was known as “Jedi Blue.”<br />The lawsuit itself said Google and Facebook were aware that their agreement could trigger antitrust investigations and discussed how to deal with them, in a passage that is followed by significant redactions.</td>

      <td>U.S. lawmakers want tougher curbs on exports to Chinese semiconductor giant</td>
      <td>The U.S. government’s move to deny China’s leading chip maker access to advanced manufacturing technology comes with exceptions that mean its impact may be mainly political and have limited effect on the company’s business.<br />Under the restriction the Commerce Department imposed last week on  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. , or SMIC, over the company’s alleged links to the Chinese military, suppliers need an export license to sell technology originating in the U.S. to the Shanghai-based chip maker. The move to put SMIC on the so-called entity list effectively gives Washington the power to block equipment critical for manufacturing.<br />The regulation applies the toughest licensing standard—a presumption of denial—to equipment dedicated to making the most advanced chips in the world with transistors 10 nanometers or smaller, the department said, using a measurement loosely referring to semiconductor size.<br />But the chips SMIC currently sells generally are larger and not covered by that rule. And, industry officials said, the tougher U.S. restrictions don’t cover more versatile tools that can be used to produce both older technology and more cutting-edge chips. Some tools that can handle more ordinary 14-nanometer designs can also be used to build high-end, 7-nanometer chips, said Handel Jones, chief executive of research firm International Business Strategies Inc.<br />Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul of Texas, on Monday asked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to rewrite the SMIC restrictions to close “dangerous loopholes” that would allow the Chinese company to continue operating without any interruption. The lawmakers in a letter said they were deeply concerned the listing “was done for show and parochial commercial interests at the expense of U.S. national security.”</td>

The regulator said it would more closely monitor so-called community group buying and warned the companies against illegal actions such as predatory pricing, abusing consumer data for profit and selling fraudulent products.<br />Representatives from food-delivery app operator  Meituan ,  e-commerce companies  JD.com Inc.  and  Pinduoduo Inc.  and ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing Technology Co. also attended the meeting.<br />The session marks Beijing’s latest salvo as it increases pressure on China’s major consumer internet companies. Many of them enjoyed relatively unchecked growth over the past decade as China sought to develop its own global technology champions. But as the companies have grown powerful, armed with massive consumer data, authorities are increasing scrutiny to keep them in check.<br />In early November, China suspended Ant Group Co.’s blockbuster initial public offering after Jack Ma, the financial technology giant’s billionaire co-founder, angered Beijing by criticizing President Xi Jinping’s signature campaign to control financial risks.</td>

      <td>U.S. consumers’ outlook on the economy darkened this month as coronavirus cases climbed nationwide and local governments imposed new restrictions, according to survey data released Tuesday.<br />The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence dropped to 88.6 in the first two weeks of December, from a revised 92.9 in November.<br />“Consumers’ assessment of current conditions deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of Covid-19 remains a drag on confidence,” said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. In particular, respondents grew more pessimistic about the labor market, with the share of consumers saying jobs are “plentiful” falling to 21.8% this month from 26.3% in November.<br />“Overall, it appears that growth has weakened further in [the fourth quarter], and consumers do not foresee the economy gaining any significant momentum in early 2021,” said Ms. Franco.<br />Tuesday’s report comes amid signs that the U.S. economic recovery is losing steam. Initial claims for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, increased in the first two weeks of December. The 885,000 new claims filed in the week ending Dec. 12 was the highest level for weekly claims since September. Private-sector data indicated the number of job openings slipped in early December.</td>

      <td>It isn’t clear why addressing climate change is up to those regulators whose mission is to regulate financial institutions and transactions, and whose expertise certainly doesn’t extend to the atmosphere. “Your New Climate 401(k)” (Review & Outlook, Dec. 15) notes that even the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates exotic financial transactions involving futures and swaps, has gotten into the climate-change business, with a special committee convened by one of its Democratic members calling for financial firms to conduct climate-change stress tests. The committee, led by a  Goldman Sachs  alumnus no less, concluded that “financial markets today are not pricing climate risk. The financial markets cannot do that on their own. Until this fundamental flaw is fixed, capital will flow in the wrong direction.”<br />Does anyone familiar with the financial markets, especially the futures markets, believe that they are unable to offer financial instruments to hedge against and price for climate risks, or that commercial firms such as insurers, which have a lot to lose in a climate apocalypse, lack sufficient self-interest to prepare for the future without being told to by the government?<br />It’s bad enough that such regulators want to get into an area that they really know nothing about. It’s worse that they have so little faith in the ability of the markets they oversee to address the risks they profess to be concerned about.<br />Robert Zwirb<br />McLean, Va.</td>

And reading his column “Vaccines vs. Lockdowns” (Business World, Dec. 16), it was refreshing to see someone argue that the vaccine development was too slow instead of too rushed.<br />Nevertheless, we should all be thankful that corners weren’t cut in the making of the vaccine. Mr. Jenkins states that the vaccine was developed in January. Although the composition of the vaccine was known by then, the proper dosage and schedule for administration weren’t determined until Phase Two was analyzed over the summer.<br />Patience in waiting for the most rapidly developed vaccine in history has yielded several safe options, more effective than many of our current vaccines, including for measles. I am happy to recommend it confidently to my patients, and I am happy that corners weren’t cut—denying anti-vaxxers ammunition in their campaign against our best weapon to fight infectious disease.<br />Paul Bower, M.D.<br />Port St. Lucie, Fla.</td>

      <td>CEO Jeff Bezos still runs the e-commerce giant with the drive of a startup trying to survive, and that strand of its corporate DNA is becoming a liability</td>
      <td>Jeff Bezos built  Amazon.com Inc.  from his garage with an underdog’s ambition to take on the establishment. He imbued staff with an obsession to grow fast by grabbing customers using the biggest selection and lowest prices. Today, he has more than 1.1 million employees and a market valuation around $1.6 trillion.<br />But Amazon never really grew up. Mr. Bezos still runs it with the drive of a startup trying to survive.<br />That ethos helps keep Amazon booming. Aggressive competition—including wresting market share from rivals—is often a hallmark of a successful business. It’s also why the tech-and-retail giant is the target of rivals, regulators and politicians who say its tactics are unfair for a company its size, and potentially illegal. As the company has grown, so has its capacity to take on an ever-growing array of competitors.<br />To keep customers happy, which Mr. Bezos has long said is Amazon’s fixation and growth strategy, executives behind the scenes have methodically waged targeted campaigns against rivals and partners alike—an approach that has changed little through the years, from diapers to footwear.<br />No competitor is too small to draw Amazon’s sights. It cloned a line of camera tripods that a small outside company sold on Amazon’s site, hurting the vendor’s sales so badly it is now a fraction of its original size, the little firm’s owner said. Amazon said it didn’t violate the company’s intellectual-property rights.</td>

But with Covid-19 cases mounting and several states tightening restrictions, many people chose to stay home and shop online as they did on Black Friday, according to shopper data.<br />Foot traffic to physical stores fell 39.1% on Super Saturday and was down nearly 40% for the entire weekend, compared with the same days last year, according to Sensormatic Solutions, which has cameras and software used to track visits to thousands of malls and shopping centers.<br />“Super Saturday weekend was perceived to be the beginning of a return to brick-and-mortar due to concerns over online shipping cutoffs,” said Brian Field, senior director of Sensormatic’s global retail consulting practice. “However, many consumers elected to stay home.”<br />Sensormatic lowered its holiday foot-traffic forecast to a decline of 34% to 36% for the six weeks ending Jan. 2, from a previous estimate of down 22% to 25%.

Oxford Economics, another research firm, estimates the additional federal spending should add about 1 percentage point to next year’s GDP growth, which it forecasts at 4.5%.<br />“Where you will see the most upside is really when it comes to household spending,” said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.<br />The bill adds $300 to weekly unemployment payments for 11 weeks and extends two other unemployment programs—at a projected cost of $120 billion. It also includes direct checks of $600 to most individuals, at a cost of $166 billion.</td>

      <td>Second small-business loans will be limited to borrowers with 300 or fewer employees who can show revenue was hurt by the pandemic</td>
      <td>The Paycheck Protection Program is getting a reboot as part of Congress’s latest coronavirus stimulus package. The $900 billion deal includes $284 billion for PPP, which will reopen after closing in August. Much like the program’s first iteration, the aid will be in the form of forgivable loans to small firms, but there will be some key changes on issues such as eligibility for second-time applicants and types of forgivable expenses. Here’s what we know so far.<br />Businesses, some nonprofit organizations, self-employed workers and independent contractors are among those eligible. Existing PPP borrowers may apply for a second loan, provided they have 300 or fewer employees and can demonstrate they experienced a 25% reduction in gross receipts during a quarter in 2020 compared with the same quarter in 2019. First-time PPP borrowers will be subject to the program’s original eligibility rules, according to a senior staffer for Republicans on the House Small Business Committee. The original PPP was generally open to businesses with up to 500 employees, and there was no requirement to demonstrate a revenue loss. More restrictive requirements for second loans reflect a consensus among lawmakers that the program’s restart should focus on businesses that have been hardest hit.<br />The maximum for second-draw loans is $2 million, less than the $10 million cap for PPP’s first round. Loan amounts will be based on an applicant’s payroll, consistent with the program’s first iteration.<br />Second-time PPP borrowers will generally be eligible to borrow an amount equal to 2½ times their average monthly payroll costs. A notable exception: Applicants in the accommodation and food services industries, as designated by the Small Business Administration, are eligible for loans that amount to 3½ times their average monthly payroll. These industries have been hit especially hard by the pandemic.<br />Borrowers are still required to spend at least 60% of the funds on payroll to receive full forgiveness. The other 40% may be used on eligible costs. As before, these costs include certain mortgage expenses, rent and utility payments. The bill expands forgivable expenses to include expenditures for personal protective equipment and other gear to protect workers; supplier costs; operations expenditures, such as software; and property damage costs due to public disturbances during 2020.</td>

      <td>Teachers are changing how they test to counter online cheating; ethicists fear a slippery slope</td>
      <td>With high-school students across the country fresh off exams, many teachers will be eyeing their test answers carefully. Remote school has made certain kinds of cheating easier than ever, leading students who may never have considered cheating before the pandemic to google answers, text friends or peek at their notes.<br />The difficult situations students face this year raise a question: Is it ever OK to cheat? Should the normal rules apply in a year that has been anything but normal?<br />“I know a lot of kids who will FaceTime during tests and take them together, or kids who have a Google tab open during tests,” said Lucie Flagg, a high-school senior in Wexford, Pa. “I think everyone knows it’s probably not right, but it’s also the easy way out. A lot of kids are just done with remote learning and have no motivation to put in the work this year.”<br />She says that teachers have told students they are aware that cheating is happening and some have said they feel powerless to stop it. Some teachers have imposed time limits on tests, making it harder to cheat. Lucie said it’s easier to have actually studied the material in those cases, because looking up answers in books or on Google takes too long. Other teachers, she said, have switched to open-notes tests.<br />Lucie said teachers at her school don’t require students’ cameras to be on during tests. Some schools do. Other districts are using sometimes-controversial tech to catch or prevent cheating, such as AI-powered online proctoring services and software that can lock down browsers. The principal at her school, North Allegheny Senior High School, declined to comment.</td>

      <td>Once-rare dual-share structures have become the norm in a sizzling tech IPO market</td>
      <td>Demand for newly listed tech stocks is booming—and so, too, is the power of founders of the Silicon Valley companies.<br />In the run-up to this month’s listing of  DoorDash Inc.,  the delivery company’s board gave co-founders 20 votes per share, up from one vote in the most recent investment round. At  Airbnb Inc.,  the company’s co-founders’ votes per share doubled to 20 in recent months, according to securities filings. And the board of  Palantir Technologies Inc.,  formerly of Silicon Valley, geared up for its public listing this fall by bestowing the data-analysis company’s three founders with enough special shares that one of them can exert control with as little as 0.5% of the stock.<br />More than a decade ago, such share structures—in which leaders get more voting potency than other shareholders—were largely reserved for a tiny number of startups, typically the ones most coveted by investors, like Google and  Facebook Inc.  Airbnb, DoorDash, Palantir and a string of other recent listings show how so-called founder control has effectively become the norm.<br />The moves by the large newly listed companies are stirring concern among proponents of strong corporate governance, particularly as they come just over a year after the failed IPO of WeWork Cos.<br />WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann had full control over the business—so much so that potential investors jettisoned the offering after being spooked by his management style and the company’s mounting losses, among other issues. The high-profile debacle led many investors in Silicon Valley to question the wisdom of granting founders so much power early on. They worried that a measure once reserved for a handful of standouts was being shared too widely and without discernment. For instance, few of the large startups going public had ever produced an annual profit.</td>

They are also looking to profit from rising demand for cheap housing from households forced to downsize during the recession.<br />The small but growing number of hotel conversions—some properties are also being turned into offices—is a symptom of the turmoil the pandemic has caused in the hotel sector. Many properties are shut down or running steep losses because of a drop in travel.<br />The share of hotels with securitized mortgages that were delinquent on their loans was 19.66% as of November, up from 1.52% a year earlier, according to Trepp LLC. Even before the pandemic, a surge of hotel construction over the past decade had left some cities with a room glut.<br />“We consider ourselves a building recycling company,” said Dan Norville, president of Vivo Living.

      <td>Brazil is first country to complete Phase 3 trials of Chinese company’s vaccine; official results due out Wednesday</td>
      <td>SÃO PAULO—Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s Covid-19 vaccine, which scientists hope can help combat the pandemic in the developing world, has passed the 50% threshold for efficacy in late-stage trials in Brazil, meaning regulators can give it the green light for use, people involved in its development said.<br />Brazil is the first country to complete Phase 3 trials of the Chinese company’s CoronaVac vaccine, which is also being tested in Indonesia and Turkey. With Covid-19 largely under control in China, the country’s vaccine developers have had to conduct their clinical trials abroad.<br />People involved in the Brazilian trials, which completed Phase 3 last week, told The Wall Street Journal that the results showed CoronaVac with an effective rate above 50%, the threshold for a vaccine to be considered viable by international scientists. The people declined to give any further information. But scientists tracking the vaccine’s development say they expect it to show efficacy comparable to other Covid-19 vaccines that have proven 95% effective in trials.<br />“Everyone is hoping for an efficacy rate above 90%,” said Domingos Alves, a professor at Ribeirão Preto Medical School in São Paulo who specializes in analyzing health data. “The results from the first phases of trials were very good.”<br />Brazil’s Butantan Institute, the research center backed by the São Paulo state government that has been testing CoronaVac, is poised to announce the vaccine’s efficacy rate on Wednesday. Butantan said Monday that it considers any information given at this time on the vaccine’s efficacy as “mere speculation.”</td>

      <td>Trump and the GOP revive the loophole for business meals. It’s bad policy and bad politics.</td>
      <td>Congress’s latest Covid relief and omnibus spending bills are a mash-up of special favors for teachers unions, the booze industry, wind power, race horses, and so much more. There’s even a bailout for Broadway; take a bow, Chuck Schumer. But for a sign of the political times, and how far Congress has strayed from basic economic logic, you can’t beat the return of the full business meal deduction.<br />President Trump has been pushing this for months, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made it a priority in negotiations. Perhaps Mr. Trump recalls fondly the days when real-estate and other executives could write off lunch or dinner at the 21 Club. Go ahead and order that Clos de Tart 2005. You can write it off. In the 1970s this became known as the “three-martini lunch” deduction when Jimmy Carter campaigned against it. The full deduction finally went away during the Reagan tax reform in the 1980s.<br />Now the deduction will return “for food or beverages provided by a restaurant” for the next two years through the end of 2022. The claim is that this will help struggling restaurants revive after the pandemic ends by giving businesses an extra incentive to leave the office for lunch. The estimated cost is $6 billion in forgone tax revenue, which is spare change for Congress this year.<br />This is bad tax policy now or any time. Restaurants have suffered during the pandemic, especially in states like New York with overly strict lockdowns. But they won’t be revived by a tax deduction for lunch. They’ll revive as the pandemic fades and the public feels safe enough to return. No business people we know make a lunch decision for tax reasons, and corporations don’t need another tax code carve-out.<br />This isn’t Covid relief. It’s a political favor for a specific industry. But why restaurants, and not hardware stores or flower shops? They’ve also suffered during the pandemic. Will a night out to see the Miami Heat qualify for the deduction if you take your clients to a game and eat at the stadium sushi bar? Why not other forms of entertainment? The unfairness is obvious, which is what happens when politicians use the tax code as a vote-buying exercise.</td>

      <td>SpaceX keeps making remarkable rocket launches look routine.</td>
      <td>We don’t have to remind readers of the ways that 2020 has been dispiriting, but there’s been some good news. The Covid vaccine rollout is a tribute to American ingenuity, and then there’s the remarkable success of the SpaceX rocket launches.<br />The latter have become so routine that they barely make the news. On Saturday the company lit the fuse on one of its 229-foot Falcon 9 rockets, which put into orbit a U.S. spy satellite. It was SpaceX’s 26th launch of 2020.<br />The part that looks surreal is when the Falcon 9’s first stage plummets back to Earth, fires its engines to arrest its fall, and then sticks an upright landing. Saturday’s rocket was launched from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. Eight minutes later, the first stage touched down on a landing pad at nearby Cape Canaveral. If you’ve never seen the feat, check out the footage online.<br />The repeat landings are a technical and economic achievement since they lower the cost of access to orbit. The Falcon 9 booster on Saturday was completing its fifth mission. This was SpaceX’s 70th successful recovery, and in November a booster was used for a seventh time. SpaceX says one might eventually fly 10 missions without a major refurbishing. The company is aiming at a 24-hour turnaround from landing to relaunch. For almost a decade after the final Space Shuttle flight in 2011, Americans had to hitch a ride to the International Space Station on Russian craft. Now they can take the Falcon 9.<br />Space exploration is risky, and two weeks ago a prototype of SpaceX’s Starship, a 160-foot silvery rocket that founder Elon Musk wants to send to Mars, was meant to gently land during a test. Instead it came down too fast and exploded in a fireball. But Mr. Musk wasn’t fazed, at least on  Twitter : “We got all the data we needed! Congrats SpaceX team hell yeah!!”</td>

      <td>The U.S. needs more ships to counter China and project power.</td>
      <td>The Trump Administration is spending some of its last days in office provoking a debate about building a larger and more lethal U.S.Navy to check China in the Pacific. This political document arrives late, but give the Trump Team credit for issuing this challenge to President-elect Joe Biden.<br />National Security AdviserRobert O’Brien and budget director Russ Vought recently laid out on these pages a plan to reach a 355-ship Navy in about a decade, up from roughly 295 today. The Pentagon has been debating and studying how to expand the fleet, and the Trump plan suggests underwriting more than 80 ships over five years at a cost of $147 billion.<br />Americans expect a dominant Navy that can deter adversaries while enforcing order on commercial sea lanes. The Navy’s top officer noted to Congress on Dec. 2 that for the past two decades the service sustained the same operational tempo as the Cold War but with a fleet almost half the size. The Navy has recently been overworking aircraft carriers with back-to-back “double pump” deployments.<br />Also notable is a consensus that the Navy needs a more diverse mix of assets. The Trump document features a Navy with more small ships like frigates, which can carry out a range of missions and be procured at lower cost than, say, destroyers. Another essential idea is ramping up production of attack submarines that would be crucial in any conflict with China.<br />The plan would also scale up unmanned ships and vehicles. These technologies are exciting but nascent and the risk is that they become the next Pentagon sinkhole. Speaking of sinkholes, another important debate concerns the future of Ford-class aircraft carriers. The first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford, price tag $13 billion, has long been mired in technology problems and delays. Carriers are also attractive targets for Chinese missiles. One percolating idea is smaller “light” carriers to complement the existing fleet of 11.</td>

      <td>Yet another scandal at the nation’s largest housing authority.</td>
      <td>Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City Housing Authority (Nycha) are the worst landlords in the Big Apple, according to a watch list released last week by the city’s public advocate. A new report by the New York City Department of Investigation offers some supporting evidence.<br />Nycha is supposed to clean up lead paint in apartments where young children live, and a supervisor certified by the Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to ensure the job gets done right. Instead, Nycha’s managers resorted to fraud and forgery, the Department of Investigation found. The probe revealed that “at least since 2013, none of NYCHA’s lead abatement jobs were ever supervised by an EPA-certified lead supervisor,” the department said in a news release. Instead, “the manager of the Lead Unit pressured employees to falsely sign paperwork stating that these jobs were supervised.”<br />Because of this falsification, it’s unclear whether lead-abatement work was done properly—or done at all—in thousands of homes. Investigators found 163 work orders with faked signatures, though they believe “the true number” is “much higher.” Based on fraudulent paperwork, the EPA approved exemptions allowing 323 Nycha homes to skip the annual visual lead inspection.<br />This trickery imperiled the health of some of New York City’s poorest children. Department of Investigation Commissioner Margaret Garnett said she’s discovered 19 young children with elevated blood-levels who lived in apartments where the paperwork was falsified. “There is no safe level of lead exposure, especially for children,” her report notes. It has been linked to lowered IQ and learning and behavioral problems, and these “cognitive effects of lead toxicity are irreversible.”<br />Nycha cooperated with investigators and has since “made significant systemic changes to its lead abatement program,” said spokeswoman Barbara Brancaccio. Yet such carelessness and cover-ups are business as usual at the nation’s largest housing authority, which barely avoided a federal takeover. The apartments are also plagued by vermin, mold and leaks, among other problems.</td>

      <td>MGM Holdings Inc., the movie studio behind the “James Bond” franchise, is exploring a sale, according to people familiar with the matter, betting that its library of content will prove attractive to companies pursuing growth in streaming video.<br />Closely held MGM has tapped investment banks  Morgan Stanley  and LionTree LLC and begun a formal sale process, the people said. The company has a market value of around $5.5 billion, based on privately traded shares and including debt, some of the people said.<br />The studio has contemplated a sale at various points over the past few years, but potential suitors have previously balked at the price MGM was seeking. MGM is hopeful the current process will generate interest beyond Hollywood’s traditional players, from international media companies, private-equity investors and blank-check companies, one of the people familiar with the matter said.<br />MGM’s biggest shareholder, New York hedge fund Anchorage Capital Group, has come under pressure in recent years from weak performance and defecting clients, and its illiquid investment in MGM has become a larger percentage of its hedge fund as it shrinks.<br />MGM’s exploration of a possible sale comes amid a bidding war for content to fill a new wave of streaming-video services. MGM’s library of titles could make it an attractive target, its investors say.</td>

      <td>My agency makes a significant advance in the government’s approach to science.</td>
      <td>The world’s climate is changing, as it always has. The challenge is to understand how and why, which is why the U.S. Geological Survey has adopted the most comprehensive climate analysis requirements ever implemented by the federal government.<br />Forecasting future responses and impacts for a system as complex as the Earth is difficult and uncertain. Consider the simple example of forecasting a hurricane where multiple models assess potential tracks within a foreseeable future of only five to seven days. The uncertainty of where the hurricane makes landfall and at what strength increases the farther out the forecast is from this timeframe because there are more variables to consider.<br />Similarly, predicting short-term, global climate changes, which are significantly more complex than forecasting hurricanes because there are less variables to assess with a hurricane than our entire planet, is far more certain than making long-term projections. The science is limited in forecasting a narrow range of plausible climate outcomes past the next two to three decades.<br />Improving our ability to forecast natural hazards and other climate conditions requires that we continue to refine our understanding of the systems, identify and scope the critical variabilities, and regularly update our forecasting to deliver the best possible information for the health, safety and well-being of our communities.<br />The U.S. Geological Survey is at the forefront of climate science for the federal government. USGS’s chief scientist, Geoffrey Plumlee, and other career scientists recently published a report, “Using Information From Global Climate Models to Inform Policymaking—the Role of the U.S. Geological Survey,” which outlines a broad, consistent and empirical approach for analyzing climate change conditions.</td>

      <td>As the faith spreads, the Communist Party fears a threat to its political control.</td>
      <td>With the European Parliament threatening to block an investment deal with China over persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang, the shock waves released by Beijing’s Hong Kong crackdown still reverberating, and the debate over the next U.S. administration’s China policy heating up, this would seem like a bad time for Beijing to kick off another major international dustup over human rights.<br />But that logic holds little appeal for Chinese policy makers today; crushing domestic dissent takes priority over burnishing the country’s image. This is bad news for China’s Christians, who face growing hostility from a ruling party that until a few years ago was willing to turn a blind eye to the proliferation of unofficial “house churches” across the country.<br />That era of toleration coincided with one of the greatest expansions of Christianity in the past 2,000 years. From an estimated three million believers at the end of the Cultural Revolution, the number of Protestants in China is now believed to exceed 100 million, with another 10 million to 12 million Catholics. (The government offers an implausible figure of 38 million Protestants.) The Council on Foreign Relations cites a 2018 estimate from Purdue’s Center on Religion and Chinese Society of between 93 million and 115 million Protestants in China. Much of the growth has come since 2010, and some projections suggest that by 2030 China could surpass America to have the largest population of Christians in the world.<br />This is one of the few competitions with the U.S. that Beijing does not want to win. Churches are increasingly targets of the Chinese Communist Party’s repression of free speech. Some have been demolished; others have been “secularized” as local officials tear down religious symbols such as crosses. Authorities are now demanding the installation of cameras to monitor worshipers’ behavior and pastors’ sermons. There are reports of Catholic churches being forced to replace pictures of the Virgin Mary with portraits of Xi Jinping.<br />In October, National Review’s Cameron Hilditch pointed to a Xinhua News Agency report that the Communist Party has decided to produce a state-approved Bible. Mr. Hilditch reports that one change is to the New Testament story in which Jesus spares a woman taken in adultery from stoning by telling her accusers not to cast the first stone unless they are sinless. In the new, improved version, when the accusers have left, Jesus stones the woman himself, saying, “I too am a sinner. But if the law could only be executed by men without blemish, the law would be dead.”</td>

      <td>Both parties are saying the stakes are national in the two Jan. 5 Senate runoffs.</td>
      <td>Tip O’Neill famously advised that “all politics is local.” Not on Jan. 5 and not in Georgia.<br />On that day Georgians will choose their two U.S. senators. But the outcome has more to do with Washington than Georgia. If Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock both win, their party will hold not only the White House but both houses of Congress. This would give Joe Biden an opportunity to run the table on everything from judicial nominees and tax hikes to trillions in spending.<br />But if one or both Republican incumbents prevail—Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler—Mitch McConnell will continue to lead a Republican majority that would then be in a position to block much of Mr. Biden’s agenda. In this way the outcome of the double runoff will help determine the power and reach of the Biden administration.<br />The latest RealClearPolitics average shows Mr. Perdue leading Mr. Ossoff 49.6% to 48.0%, and Ms. Loeffler up over Mr. Warnock 49.2% to 48.4%. But the results remain within the margin of error, and there are too many variables to predict the outcome with any confidence.<br />The biggest variable is who will turn out, and in what numbers. According to Georgia Votes, 1,471,144 people have voted so far—roughly 1 in 5 registered voters. Based on which party ballot those who voted in the June primary requested, it’s now running 59% to 39% in favor of Democrats.</td>

      <td>Significantly tighter rules for approving jetliner designs have been incorporated in a year-end federal omnibus spending bill, all but guaranteeing final congressional passage of safety reforms sparked by two fatal  Boeing Co.  737 MAX jet crashes.<br />Bipartisan support for the provisions, which had appeared stalled in recent weeks, sets the stage for the most sweeping changes in decades of how the Federal Aviation Administration assesses and approves new airliner models.  Rolling the bill into the $1.4 trillion funding package, expected to win House and Senate passage, eliminates opportunities for debate or amendments.<br />Hammered out by lawmakers to respond to public anger over the 737 MAX tragedies, the final language gives the FAA substantially more authority to oversee technical details and reject company engineering decisions.<br />The legislation also empowers FAA leaders to individually vet industry officials designated to act on behalf of the agency in safety matters. Currently, companies choose such so-called designees with limited FAA input. And it authorizes fines and other penalties if company supervisors exert undue pressure on engineers to meet cost or schedule targets.<br />Other provisions establish new protections for whistleblowers and provide increased funding to enhance the agency’s expertise, particularly in assessing how pilots react to malfunctions of automated cockpit systems.</td>
