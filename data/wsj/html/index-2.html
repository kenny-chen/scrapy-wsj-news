      <td>Jobless claims jumped sharply last week, fresh data showed Thursday</td>
      <td>U.S. stock futures edged down Thursday as fresh data showed unemployment claims jumped sharply last week.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked 0.3% lower, suggesting the broad-market index is on track for muted gains after the opening bell. Nasdaq-100 futures slid 0.6%, pointing to a second day of declines for tech stocks after Facebook was hit by a series of antitrust lawsuits.<br />Applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, rose sharply to 853,000 last week. It was more than economists had forecast. Separately, data also showed that consumer prices in November ticked up by 0.2%.<br />“Today’s increase in initial jobless claims is another sign economic momentum may be fading,” said Richard Flynn, a managing director at Charles Schwab.<br />The dimming economic picture may make it more imperative for Congress to pass a fresh fiscal-stimulus spending bill that would support businesses and households through the economic downturn, he said. Lawmakers have broadly agreed with the White House that the aid package should total around $900 billion, but key points of contention remain. A bipartisan group continued to negotiate late Wednesday.</td>

      <td>Central bank’s decision underscores the bumpy path ahead for the eurozone economy</td>
      <td>FRANKFURT—The European Central Bank scaled up its emergency bond-buying program by more than a third and unveiled a new batch of ultracheap loans for banks, a bold move aimed at backstopping the region’s governments and businesses as they navigate a stubborn resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The move, which takes the ECB’s monetary stimulus this year above 3 trillion euros, equivalent to $3.6 trillion, underscores the rocky path ahead for the 19-nation eurozone economy. Europe has been hit much harder than the U.S. and other advanced economies as strict lockdowns have repeatedly closed businesses and hurt the south’s large tourism industry.<br />Together with a new €750 billion joint fund that European Union leaders are expected to finalize this week, the decision underscores Europe’s willingness to combat this year’s economic downturn using new debt. That marks a shift in strategy from the region’s debt crisis a decade ago, when many governments sought to quickly tighten their purse strings.<br />Markets were muted following the ECB’s decision, though yields on Italian government debt, the riskiest among the area’s major economies, hovered near multiyear lows, indicating that investors were comfortable with the bank’s efforts to keep the financial system flush with cash.<br />They will now turn to ECB President Christine Lagarde’s news conference, starting at 8:30 a.m. ET, where she will explain the reasoning behind the decision and unveil fresh forecasts for economic growth and inflation.</td>

      <td>IKEA’s decision to stop publishing its annual catalog marks the end of a tome that served as much as an aspirational lifestyle guide for millions as it did a marketing tool for the flat-pack furniture giant.<br />After 70 years, the catalog had become a relic in the digital age, the company said, calling the decision “emotional but rational.” The 2020 edition, which was sent out earlier this year, will be the last. The catalog will also no longer be published online.<br />Like an international version of the  Sears  catalog, which ceased publication in 1993, the IKEA book sold not only housewares, but a lifestyle. Each year’s version usually took on a theme connected to the home—2020’s was “sleep”—while promoting the company’s compact, Scandinavian aesthetic for everything from cheap futons to custom kitchen redesigns that can cost thousands of dollars.<br />“It was an opportunity to sit down and dream,” said Marthinus Strydom, who previously worked as creative director on IKEA’s ad campaigns. “A lot of people are sad to see it go. It occupied a cultural spot in brand marketing. It was special.”<br />As web shopping surged over the past two decades, IKEA said fewer and fewer people were using its catalog. A spokeswoman said that, in the course of testing new formats and ways to distribute the catalog, the company found it wasn’t worth the investment anymore.</td>

The lawsuits accuse Facebook of acquiring the Instagram photo-sharing app and WhatsApp messaging service as part of an illegal strategy to monopolize social networking and foreclose competition.<br />Effectively, officials are arguing this: Look at the forest, not the individual trees.<br />“Our enforcement action challenges more than just the acquisitions: We are challenging a multiyear course of conduct,” the FTC wrote in a question-and-answer document published Wednesday.</td>

That marked the highest level of applications since September, but was still well down from a peak of nearly seven million earlier in the March 28 week.<br />Jobless claims have mostly trended down since the spring, when the pandemic caused widespread business shutdowns. That matches with other measures showing the economy is recovering, but at a slower pace in recent months.<br />Jobless claims data has been viewed as a bellwether for economists and policy makers for a half-century. However, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, last month said jobless claims have contained inconsistent data because of the pandemic-related surge in applications and attempted fraud. The Labor Department said it doesn’t plan to change its methodology. Economists also caution the claims figures can be volatile from week to week, especially around holiday periods.<br />“Job destruction has not come to an end,” Andy Challenger, senior vice president at outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., said before Thursday’s data. “We might be gaining jobs overall, but thousands of people are losing their jobs every week because demand has not returned.”</td>

Crescents of delicata squash roasted with butter and sage nestle into a bed of velvety cauliflower purée. Topped with hazelnuts, chile flakes, brown butter and a drizzle of honey, it’s a meatless meal that more than satisfies meat eaters.<br />It also conveys the sense of cozy indulgence diners expect at Gianna.

MYR is currently selling the drug in France, Germany and Austria and plans to launch in more countries next year, Gilead said. The company intends to seek U.S. approval in the second half of 2021.<br />Under the terms of the deal, Gilead will pay MYR shareholders up to $362 million, reported as 300 million euros, in additional milestone payments upon a U.S. approval, Gilead said.</td>

A van driven by Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham was found to contain an undetonated pipe bomb. Officials said the two had planned the attack for months while traveling and living in Bayonne, N.J., and Ohio, and had a history of making statements against police and Jewish people.<br />Mayor Steven Fulop, who is Jewish, said in an interview that the incident left deep wounds across the city, traumatizing Jewish residents, members of law enforcement and members of the city’s Black community.<br />In the months since the attack, city officials have worked to counter anti-Semitism and strengthen tactical preparedness, Mr. Fulop said, by holding meetings with community leaders and residents, and implementing training for officers.</td>

Mr. Hittle furloughed his sales staff and cut pay, then benefited from a Paycheck Protection Program loan and a summer outdoor-dining boomlet before cold weather lowered demand again.<br />“I feel like I’m in a boxing ring.

The nearly six-year-old company billed itself as a technology provider and used an online platform to transact with property owners and tenants. It went public in the U.S. in January this year.<br />Danke also relied heavily on an unusual financing model. Most tenants of the more than 419,000 apartments it manages took out rental loans from online lenders. The lump sums these individuals borrowed—typically for a year’s rent—went to Danke, which paid some of it to landlords monthly or quarterly, and used the rest to help fund apartment renovations, maintenance services and its operations. Renters paid down the loans in monthly installments to lenders.<br />At the end of 2019, Danke had the equivalent of $420 million in short-term liabilities from “rent financing,” making up a little more than half its total borrowings.</td>

The U.S. and Australia have taken more forceful stands against pressure from China, sparking public fights and trade battles.<br />The annual China-EU CEO and Former Senior Officials Dialogue—a closed-door event that includes around 40 chief executives, top officials and academics from Europe and China—would have been its fourth edition and taken place this year by videoconference.<br />In previous years, participant lists weren’t controversial, organizers say. But this year, European organizers at BusinessEurope, an umbrella organization for the European Union’s national business lobbies, rejected Chinese demands to exclude certain participants.<br />The event’s cancellation offers a fresh sign of Europe’s hardening stance toward Beijing, a shift that became evident last year when the bloc described China as a systemic rival, and was underscored during the coronavirus pandemic with senior EU officials blaming China for disinformation. But the reluctance on both sides to escalate this conflict and the organizers’ insistence that another dialogue should take place again next year highlight the conflicting forces at play.</td>

Big cities visited by tourists had been Airbnb’s strength, but it redesigned its app and website to focus on local stays as people flocked to destinations within driving distance.<br />In August, more than half of bookings made were for stays within 300 miles of the guest’s location, according to the company.<br />As Airbnb blossomed into a global behemoth, it spent big. Costs jumped five-fold between 2015 and 2019. The pandemic forced the company to shed a quarter of staff, remove noncore businesses and drastically cut sales and marketing, a big expense.</td>

PETERSBURG—In August, President Vladimir Putin heralded the approval of a Russian vaccine against Covid-19. Officials promised to produce millions of doses by year’s end.<br />Now, however, those ambitions have been greatly reduced—St. Petersburg, home to five million people, is due to get just 5,000 doses this month—as the country struggles to manufacture the two-shot vaccine, Sputnik V, in large quantities. Russia expects to produce just two million doses by the end of the year, down from the 30 million promised over the summer.<br />“We were all excited when 30 million doses were promised,” said Dmitry Kulish, professor at Moscow-based private research institute Skoltech, which focuses on pharmaceutical innovation. “But that was a hyper-optimistic forecast. We are more realistic now.”<br />To help ramp up production, Russian authorities have turned to a clutch of companies including BIOCAD, a private-sector pharmaceutical company that hasn’t been involved in vaccine work before. Hundreds of its scientists and technicians are now racing to find ways to transform small amounts of the vaccine into tens of millions of doses.<br />“Scaling is a complex process,” said Dmitry Morozov, BIOCAD’s chief executive. “What was effective in the lab may not be replicated in large volumes.”</td>

      <td>Regulator sidesteps EU’s GDPR privacy law to issue its own fines, a record for a privacy case in France</td>
      <td>PARIS—France’s privacy watchdog issued more than $163 million in fines to  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and  Amazon.com Inc.,  saying they improperly collected information about website visitors, taking a hard line as European regulators haggle over such sanctions.<br />The French regulator, the CNIL, said Thursday that it fined Google €100 million, equivalent to $120.8 million—a record for a privacy fine in France—for allegedly storing advertising-related identifiers on millions of users’ computers before asking for individuals’ consent, and without explaining sufficiently how the identifiers, called cookies, were used. It fined Amazon €35 million for the same violations.<br />Since the CNIL informed Google and Amazon of its investigations earlier this year, each company has updated its website in Europe to stop placing advertising cookies before asking for consent, the CNIL said Thursday. But the regulator added that the companies still don’t properly explain how the cookies are used, and ordered both companies to better inform users within three month—or face further fines of €100,000 a day.<br />Google stands by its privacy efforts in Europe, a company spokesman said, and is considering whether to appeal the CNIL decision. The decision “overlooks these efforts and doesn’t account for the fact that French rules and regulatory guidance are uncertain and constantly evolving,” he said.<br />An Amazon spokesman said the company disagrees with the decision, and complies with privacy laws. “We continuously update our privacy practices to ensure that we meet the evolving needs and expectations of customers and regulators,” he said. He didn’t reply when asked if the company plans to appeal.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—China is revoking visa exemptions for U.S. diplomatic passport holders in Hong Kong and Macau and said it would impose other unspecified sanctions to retaliate for actions the Trump administration took against Chinese officials this week.<br />The sanctions would affect U.S. officials and nonprofit personnel who had “expressed vile positions on the Hong Kong question” along with their immediate family members, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Thursday at a regular press briefing in Beijing.<br />The moves were undertaken because the U.S. had “exploited Hong Kong-related issues to seriously interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s core interests,” Ms. Hua said. She didn’t say when the sanctions would take effect.<br />Beijing’s announcement comes after the White House placed 14 senior Chinese officials on its sanctions blacklist on Monday. The Trump administration said the officials had been responsible for eroding Hong Kong’s political autonomy.<br />Asked for comment on the Chinese sanctions, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing referred to a statement published on their website earlier on Thursday, expressing “the United States’ deep concerns over Beijing’s ongoing assault against the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people guaranteed to them in the Sino-U.K. Joint Declaration.”</td>

      <td>Rollout of new shots highlights gaps in countries’ monitoring of who gets inoculated</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—As they prepare to roll out Covid-19 vaccines, governments world-wide are grappling with how to keep track of those who have been immunized.<br />Many developed countries maintain lists of who has received vaccines, but those registries can rely on incomplete data provided voluntarily by doctors, pharmacies and even health-care providers that distribute flu shots to corporate clients in winter. The U.S. doesn’t have a national database, but states and some localities maintain their own.<br />Health experts say it will be crucial for governments to monitor accurately who gets inoculated, particularly because many vaccines are under development and some are expected to require multiple doses. Widespread tracking would also enable health officials to detect any adverse reactions, which is important because the vaccines are being developed much faster than usual.<br />“It is mandatory to have this kind of information to protect the health of the population,” said Terry Slevin, chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia. Government health officials there plan to require health-care providers to report who gets a coronavirus vaccine to that country’s register.<br />Requiring reporting presents several challenges to authorities, including the security of patient health data. Early in the pandemic, an Australian government initiative to develop an app that would record whether someone was in contact with anyone infected with the coronavirus foundered when many people avoided it on privacy grounds.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY— Rio Tinto  PLC’s destruction of two ancient caves in Australia to expand an iron-ore mine could have ramifications for global commodity markets if local lawmakers intensify scrutiny of mining activities that threaten heritage sites.<br />Among the most controversial recommendations made by a federal-government inquiry into the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia in May is a moratorium on expansions of existing mines or new pits that encroach on sites of cultural or historical significance. Even if lawmakers opt for a less hard-line approach, experts warn of potential delays to production and higher costs that could affect supply of key raw materials such as iron ore, used to make steel.<br />None of the recommendations handed down by the inquiry in its interim report on Wednesday are binding, but miners risk inflaming tensions with some investors who feel the industry needs to show greater sensitivity to environmental and cultural issues if they don’t accept them. They also face sensitive negotiations with indigenous groups that are the traditional owners of the land.<br />Metals prices have been rallying as China’s economy bounces back strongly and other major markets recover from the coronavirus crisis. Copper prices have risen to their highest level in almost eight years. Iron ore is one of the best-performing assets this year, fetching $150.75 a metric ton on Wednesday, its highest price since early 2013.<br />China’s unexpectedly strong appetite for these commodities has raised concerns over whether there is enough supply, with many analysts predicting market deficits for iron ore and copper through at least the middle of next year.</td>

This initial stamp of approval is meant to lay the groundwork for eventual civilian certification of the technology and even approval of autonomous flights crossing American cities, industry and military officials said. The current version does require a pilot.<br />For now, the impact of the Air Force’s decision, expected to be announced as soon as Thursday, is limited. It means Joby Aviation, a Northern California startup, will become the first maker of novel vertical-takeoff-and-landing craft providing transportation for the U.S. armed services.<br />The Air Force will help accelerate safety analyses by conducting flight tests, pledging to pay for contracts seeking to verify vehicle reliability and generally vetting the capabilities of vehicles through direct and indirect funding of the company.<br />The Air Force intends to help jump-start the budding industry to enhance American competitiveness. The process is expected to take years, but the race to develop air taxis already has attracted significant investments from companies including  Boeing Co. ,  Toyota Motor Corp. , South Korea’s  Hyundai Motor Group  and  Airbus SE .</td>

      <td>The Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against  Facebook Inc.  puts the regulatory spotlight on the deal-making history of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, who has personally engineered the tech giant’s biggest acquisitions.<br />The FTC and a group of 46 states in separate antitrust lawsuits on Wednesday alleged that Facebook engaged in a yearslong campaign to acquire or stymie nascent technology companies that it feared could become rivals. The FTC said it was seeking court relief that could include forcing Facebook to sell two of its biggest acquisitions: messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing app Instagram, which competition authorities previously chose not to challenge.<br />The claims put the CEO’s competitive behavior front and center. Since co-founding the social network in his dorm as a Harvard sophomore, Mr. Zuckerberg has closely managed its approach to rivals, including the deals for Instagram, WhatsApp and virtual-reality company Oculus VR, which have helped make Facebook into a giant with a market value of around $800 billion.<br />Facebook said that the complaints amounted to “revisionist history” and that the company’s success was based on investment, innovation and value to users and customers. The Instagram and WhatsApp deals “were intended to provide better products for the people who use them, and they unquestionably did,” Facebook General Counsel Jennifer Newstead said in a statement.<br />Mr. Zuckerberg’s internal discussions about some of those deals, made public through Wednesday’s complaints and through previous litigation and inquiries into Facebook’s practices, have laid bare his competitive concerns over the years with upstarts that had comparatively tiny user bases.</td>

The FDA isn’t required to accept the decision of an advisory panel, but generally does so.<br />The 23-member Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is likely to authorize use of the vaccine, according to Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan health researcher who chairs the advisory committee.<br />Dr. Monto said that assessment is based on data released Tuesday showing that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and 95% effective, with adverse reactions rare despite a range of modest side effects such as headaches and fatigue that occur soon after injections.<br />The panel’s meeting will be public and live-streamed. FDA officials hope the discussion will show the care with which the vaccine’s safety has been reviewed—part of a broader effort to convince the public that the vaccine hasn’t been rushed to market for political expediency.</td>

On Wednesday, the yuan briefly moved below 6.50 to the U.S. dollar for the first time in about 2½ years.<br />The rally is taking those Asian currencies to levels the countries’ exporters and governments are less comfortable with, raising the possibility of renewed tension with the U.S. Treasury Department if they try to damp the pace of appreciation.<br />In November, China recorded its largest month-on-month increase in foreign-exchange reserves in seven years, South Korea the largest rise in 10 years, and Taiwan the largest increase ever. Foreign-exchange reserves tend to rise when countries intervene to prevent appreciation by buying dollar-denominated assets.<br />Both South Korea and China are already on the Treasury Department’s monitoring list for being designated as currency manipulators, which means they fit at least one of the three criteria—significant current account surpluses, significant bilateral trade surpluses with the U.S., and persistent one-sided intervention in the foreign-exchange markets.<br />The incoming U.S. administration is likely to have a different attitude to currency manipulation, but that won’t necessarily mean an easier ride for Seoul, Taipei or Beijing. As with trade-related issues, the incoming administration is expected to be more predictable and rules-oriented but not necessarily any more permissive.</td>

A separate filing said that would trigger cross-defaults on a further $2 billion in dollar bonds—three issues, coming due between 2021 and 2028.<br />The missed payments come as China’s central and local governments become more selective in bailing out ailing borrowers, both at home and abroad. Some analysts and investors believe authorities are pushing forward with a campaign to clear out unviable companies and dispel the idea that government-backed companies’ creditors will always be made whole.<br />Last month, Tsinghua Unigroup defaulted on a privately placed domestic bond worth 1.3 billion yuan, or the equivalent of $199 million. Alongside defaults by a major coal company and the parent of  BMW AG’s  Chinese joint-venture partner, it unsettled participants in China’s bond markets.<br />The chip maker’s dollar debt has been trading at deep discounts to face value, suggesting investors already doubted they would be repaid in full. The unit that issued the $450 million note said that it and Tsinghua Unigroup were “looking into various ways to solve their current liquidity issue.”</td>

      <td>CEO Elon Musk says test flight, without crew, validated rocketship’s launch, ascent and some key airborne maneuvers</td>
      <td>Elon Musk’s space-transportation company SpaceX blasted its Starship spacecraft nearly 8 miles high and maneuvered it back seemingly to a pinpoint landing, but then suffered a spectacular explosion as the vehicle failed to slow down before smashing into the ground.<br />Wednesday’s sequence of events even prompted an elated Mr. Musk initially to post a message on Twitter that the 16-story Starship prototype executed a key airborne maneuver precisely and made it back to the designated landing point. Checking the craft’s ability to control its direction during descent was one of the main reasons for the flight, the first high-altitude test of the private vehicle designed to explore the solar system.<br />But within minutes, after a video feed showed a fireball at the instant of touchdown, Mr. Musk posted a follow-up tweet explaining that low fuel pressure “during the landing burn contributed to the high touchdown velocity and the massive explosion.”<br />Still, the company’s founder and chief technical officer added there was good news because the team “got all the data” it needed during the mission. “It appears everything is in order for future tests,” he said.<br />Weeks before launch, Mr. Musk had sought to tamp down expectations by predicting a 1-in-3 chance of success for the test of the reusable craft, which uses a complex midair maneuver that flips it from nose-down to a final nose-up descent. That abrupt movement—which industry officials say hasn’t been successfully executed before by any other big booster—is one of the most challenging aspects of Starship’s flight profile. Preparing for the flight, Mr. Musk promised the company would show real-time footage of the test, “warts and all”—something he had eschewed for some earlier Starship tests.</td>

      <td>Netflix reveals the top ten lists for non-English films and series in the U.S.; comedies and romances are out, action is very much in</td>
      <td>One of the most popular foreign movies on  Netflix  in the U.S. is “Kidnapping Stella,” a German thriller about a pregnant hostage who battles and outwits her captors. It’s relatively low on subtitles or dubbed dialogue, lacks obscure cultural references and fits into an easily recognizable genre. Americans are one of its biggest audiences.<br />“We tried to make the film look international and not German,” said writer-director Thomas Sieben, adding that Americans helped his film reach nearly 19 million global views in its first four weeks on the platform. “You have to really work hard to give the film the best look so that people don’t say, ‘Ugh, this looks like a typical German movie, I hate it.’ ”<br />The global hits on Netflix in the U.S. are a long way from the esoteric fare that has defined foreign art on screen for years. Gone are the days of French bohemians (“Jules et Jim”), Italian clowns (“La Strada”) and a German horse head full of eels (“The Tin Drum”). Now it’s high-speed car chases, invincible heroes and post-apocalyptic showdowns.<br />In an effort to grow its world-wide audience, Netflix has been steadily increasing its catalog of foreign programming, giving Americans access to more international films and series than ever. Netflix shared with The Wall Street Journal the top 10 foreign-language films and TV shows most popular with U.S. audiences. Not a single comedy or meet-cute romance made it onto the lists. Instead, the rankings were dominated by gritty fare like thrillers and action movies.<br />Deadly viruses propel the plots of the South Korean film “#Alive,” the Russian series “To the Lake” and the Danish show “The Rain.” Children go missing in the German series “Dark” and “Kidnapping Stella,” a German remake of a British movie. Corrupt police drive the action in the French films “Lost Bullet” and “Rogue City.”</td>

      <td>U.S. antitrust authorities have been examining for more than a year whether Facebook used its market position to stifle competition</td>
      <td>The Federal Trade Commission and a group of 48 attorneys general have filed antitrust lawsuits against  Facebook Inc.  The Wall Street Journal previously reported that a focus of antitrust probes were the company’s past acquisitions of potential competitors, such as photo-sharing service Instagram. Here’s a look at why Facebook’s past deal activity is under scrutiny:<br />What does the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit allege?<br />The FTC alleges Facebook, founded in 2004, maintained a monopoly in the U.S. by acquiring companies that presented competitive threats. “After identifying two significant competitive threats to its dominant position—Instagram and WhatsApp—Facebook moved to squelch those threats by buying the companies, reflecting Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s view, expressed in a 2008 email, that ‘it is better to buy than compete,’” the lawsuit said.<br />The agency also accused the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company of anticompetitive conduct in how third-party apps access information from Facebook. In the lawsuit the FTC said the company made certain application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-party apps only if they refrained from providing core functions similar to what Facebook offered.<br />What do the state attorneys general allege?</td>

      <td>Decades of cuts left the U.S. fleet at almost 1916 levels, but President Trump is changing all that.</td>
      <td>The Trump administration this week is taking an important step to quicken the U.S. Navy’s buildup after its disastrous decline under previous administrations. By the Obama administration’s last year, after decades of cuts to shipbuilding and maintenance, the Navy had been stripped down to a fleet barely larger than it was 100 years ago. These 275 ships struggled to meet America’s national-security needs, leaving crews stressed, basic maintenance deferred, and the country at risk. The shipbuilding industrial base shrank to a fraction of the manufacturing might that won the Cold War.<br />Mr. Trump has made it a priority to expand the fleet to 355 battle-force ships and strengthen America’s maritime supremacy. This “blue water” strategic approach deters U.S. adversaries, allows America to project power abroad, and over time offers a cost-effective alternative to endless deployments overseas. As a maritime nation, the U.S. depends on control of the sea to protect its people as well as the flow of cargo.<br />The Trump administration has steadily increased the number and readiness of battle-force ships and Thursday will move to accelerate that buildup. The White House will release a 30-year shipbuilding plan that devotes the resources necessary to making a 355-ship fleet a reality.<br />The seminal document is the result of an unprecedented nine-month study of naval force structure by the Pentagon. It provides a detailed blueprint to lawmakers and industry partners, reinforcing the American commitment to maintaining maritime supremacy.<br />The plan will provide a battle force of 355 vessels within 10 years and nearly 400 within 20 years. It will end the decadeslong decline in attack submarines by building three a year beginning in 2025, with a goal of 80. It will more than double the number of small multimission ships to nearly 70. The backbone of this ship class will be the new Constellation-class frigates, and the Navy will need a second shipyard to increase the pace of construction. The workhorses of the fleet, Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, will be modernized.</td>

      <td>His current Covid relief demands contradict his own bill from July.</td>
      <td>Democrats are outraged this week that the White House rejected their demand for four more months of $300 in weekly enhanced jobless payments in Covid relief talks. “That is unacceptable,” thundered Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in a statement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Would he say the same about legislation he introduced in July with Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden?<br />The Senators’ bill would set up a tiered system to replace the Cares Act’s $600 extra in weekly federal benefits, which expired July 31. Folks in states with an unemployment rate of 11% or higher—calculated as a three-month average—would continue to get the extra $600. But that amount would decrease by $100 for each percentage-point drop in a state’s unemployment rate.<br />Jobless workers in a state with a 6% to 7% unemployment rate would receive only an extra $100 a week. The bill “would tie the extension of enhanced UI benefits to economic data—not politics,” Mr. Schumer said at the time. “As the need goes down, so will the benefits. As the need goes up, so will the benefits.”<br />He should look at the data now. Sixteen states including Virginia and South Carolina now have three-month-average unemployment rates (August through October, the latest data available) below 6%—meaning they wouldn’t be eligible for extra benefits under Mr. Schumer’s bill. Eleven states would land in the $100 tier. Only 11 states and Washington, D.C., would qualify for $300 or more.<br />Unemployment has been falling, especially in states that haven’t reimposed lockdowns. Mr. Schumer’s New York has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country at 9.6%. Like California (9.3%), it continues to enforce some of the strictest limitations on businesses and restaurants.</td>

Nasdaq is now offering “Limited time, complimentary access” to “The Equilar Diversity Network.”<br />No one objects to board diversity, but Nasdaq wants to force Americans to pay for its political signaling. The exchange said last week in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing it wants companies to have at least two “Diverse” directors. That’s defined as “one director who self-identifies as female,” and “one who self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.”<br />Oh, and if a director is gay—or has one parent who is Vietnamese—but is not interested in announcing his sexual orientation or ethnicity in public documents for enforcers at the Nasdaq to review, it doesn’t count. The directors must “self-identify” in a Nasdaq preferred category.<br />Nasdaq claims, including in a letter to these pages Wednesday, that it is only aiming for “transparency.” But the names of board members already must be disclosed. Nasdaq wants companies to list how many board members fit in each category. If companies don’t meet Nasdaq’s quota, then they must “explain why they do not” in filings or on their website—or face delisting. That’s intended as a public-relations sanction even if Nasdaq pretends it isn’t.<br />Nasdaq doesn’t have authority to order companies to comply with any political fashion, so it claims in its SEC filing that these new mandates are designed to promote “a free and open market.” This market will apparently benefit Nasdaq’s new diversity enterprise with Equilar.</td>

      <td>It’s been a rough year for California government: catastrophic wildfires, power outages, and now massive unemployment benefit fraud. It appears the progressive paragon can’t even make transfer payments without making a hash.<br />Many states have reported more fraudulent jobless benefit claims due to the pandemic Cares Act, which allowed independent contractors to qualify based on purported lost earnings. State systems weren’t designed to handle these claims. But California seems to be the biggest sap.<br />On Monday  Bank of America ,  which contracted with the state government to issue benefit debit cards, identified some $2 billion in suspicious activities with many claims filed in the names of infants, centenarians and people living outside the U.S. The bank said fraudulent payments may be financing terrorists and illicit arms purchases. “The scale of program fraud in California is unique,” the bank wrote to legislators, who are (of course) blaming the bank for freezing suspicious accounts.<br />In October federal authorities arrested a Los Angeles rapper for allegedly stealing identities to swipe $1.2 million in federal jobless benefits. The rapper flaunted his heist in a music video he posted to YouTube in which he held up stacks of pre-loaded debit cards: “You gotta sell cocaine, I just file a claim.”<br />Local law enforcement has busted several criminal rings. Last month nine district attorneys sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom warning of rampant benefit fraud in prisons. More than $140 million in benefits have been paid in the names of 20,000 state prisoners, including 133 on death row. Unlike most states, California doesn’t check claims against prison rolls.</td>

It’ll take months to make billions more, distribute them and inoculate people in numbers large enough to end this global pandemic, so we aren’t out of the woods yet. But we’re witnessing modern science’s amazing ingenuity, creativity and results.<br />Credit for the unprecedented speed in developing these vaccines goes to scientists and researchers who worked endless hours and showed incredible skill. Credit also goes to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, which gave critical resources and expeditious approvals to pharmaceutical companies.</td>

      <td>Stripping OMB staffers of civil-service protection will make it harder for the president to do his job.</td>
      <td>We served as presidential appointees in the Office of Management and Budget under Republican and Democratic administrations, and we disagree on plenty. But we are in complete accord that OMB’s career professionals are essential for effective government. They bring deep knowledge—built up over years, sometimes decades—of how government works, which approaches to policy have succeeded or failed, and why.<br />That’s why we are alarmed by reports that OMB Director Russell Vought has, in the waning days of the administration, reclassified 88% of the OMB’s career staff into a new Schedule F category that means they can be hired and fired at will on political grounds. The move was a hasty effort to implement an executive order from President Trump that overturned more than a century of civil service law to exert greater political control over government employees in “policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions.”<br />The OMB is a unique government institution in that it is located in the Executive Office of the President but is staffed largely by career civil servants who don’t change with each administration. Unlike agencies with particular missions, like environmental protection, agriculture, energy, etc., the OMB has a crosscutting perspective that covers the whole executive branch—coordinating budgets, regulatory policy, management priorities, information policy, and more.<br />The OMB office we each headed, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, has a staff of fewer than 60 career civil servants. Many have served multiple presidents, and can help political officials better understand when federal regulations are consistent with the president’s priorities as well as with longstanding law and administrative practice. Their nonpolitical positions allow them to provide objective and informed advice. The OMB’s political appointees make the ultimate policy decisions, but those decisions can and often do reflect the sound, evidence-based advice and institutional memory of the career staff.<br />The role of career OMB staff is particularly critical during transitions between administrations. A new administration couldn’t possibly produce a budget within a couple months of taking office without a staff of experienced budget examiners with institutional knowledge of the myriad federal programs and agencies. Presidents throughout their administrations, and especially at the beginning and end of their terms, need career OIRA staff to advise on regulatory actions to ensure they are defensible and durable.</td>

      <td>The digital economy should have a code of conduct that enhances competition and encourages innovation.</td>
      <td>The antitrust cases against Google and now  Facebook  are a welcome reinvigoration of the government’s power to stop monopolization. The cases, however, aren’t enough. They will become drawn-out legal battles and will likely leave many anticompetitive practices unchanged. The U.S. should complement its litigation approach by following the lead of the British government, which recently announced the creation of a new regulatory body, the Digital Markets Unit, to enforce a code of conduct for the digital economy.<br />Digital giants like Google and Facebook dominate the internet in part because they have developed great products. But they are also gigantic because they make it harder for other companies to enter the market and compete. This reduces the quality of their offerings, limits choices for consumers, and inhibits innovation.<br />The challenge for policy makers is how to preserve what’s good about the digital giants while moving the digital economy toward the promise of capitalism, in which competition supports vibrant innovation and benefits consumers. Better enforcement of merger and antitrust law can play a role, but the best approach would be to establish new pro-competition regulation to specify the rules of the road, providing greater certainty for companies large and small, expanded opportunity for new companies to enter the market, and greater choice and control for consumers.<br />Numerous industries have become more concentrated in recent decades, increasingly dominated by smaller numbers of companies. Sometimes this happens for good reasons, like when the increased efficiency of large retailers enables them to grow and expand, leading to rising productivity and lower markups and prices. Sometimes it happens for bad reasons, such as U.S. hospital mergers that have led to minimal efficiency gains but higher prices.<br />The tech industry has become increasingly consolidated for a combination of good reasons—the network effects that accrue when many people use the same products, and economies of scale and scope—but also for bad reasons, such as a small number of companies leveraging their power in some areas to extend and protect it in others. For an example, see Google’s deals to feature its search engines on  Apple  devices.</td>

      <td>A professor argues that we should engage with the classics, not only in spite of, but even because of, our moral differences with them.</td>
      <td>Alan Jacobs reports that, though he has been teaching old books to classrooms full of students for many years, lately when he walks into a classroom “fairly regularly the first thing I see is every head bowed before a glowing screen.” Ever-present screen-based entertainment, a 24-hour news cycle and the constant connectivity of social media place us in a constant sensory flux. This is not a hospitable environment for the study of great books, but Mr. Jacobs argues that our current predicament provides even more reason for turning to them: Reading old books promises to lengthen our “now,” situating and stabilizing us so that we become possessed of more tranquil minds and less dominated by impulse. Those who can tie themselves to the great minds of the past, Mr. Jacobs tells us, will achieve greater “temporal bandwidth.”<br />Mr. Jacobs, a professor at Baylor University, frames his book “Breaking Bread With the Dead” as an expansion of the humanistic classroom: Set aside your phones, I will teach you to pay attention to Homer, and Horace and Milton. As a fellow teacher, I was eager to see how he would encourage and invite the uninitiated reader, the one beset by an internet of distractions, to “overcome the gravitational pull of the moment” by “breaking bread with” such difficult authors. His book, a loosely linked series of essays, does not exactly deliver on this promise.<br />Much of it is given over to illustrating and defusing a potential worry: You might think we shouldn’t read old books because, to put it gently, ancient authors do not have modern moral sensibilities. Aristotle argued in favor of slavery; Shakespeare seemed to think shrews needed taming. Mr. Jacobs spends a lot of time telling us that it is possible to take the moral failings of a work seriously without dismissing its virtues, but he rarely pauses to mount a thorough defense of any particular author.<br />Mr. Jacobs’s concern is not so much to tell us how to sort through individual cases as to encourage and exhort us: Serious engagement with old books is possible not only in spite of, but even because of, our moral differences with them. But why did this point need to be hammered home? In my classroom experience—and I would be very surprised to hear that Mr. Jacobs’s differs—the problem that the uninitiated have with “The Iliad” is not that they are offended by its sexism. Yes, it is true that women are conceived as prizes, but this is not why people struggle to partake of the wonders of Homer. Students struggle because they are bored and confused.<br />Mr. Jacobs is right that there are real wonders in “The Iliad”; he is right to say that when “old King Priam goes to his knees to beg his son’s killer for his son’s body, a powerful electrical current leaps across the millennia.” But this scene comes in Book 24, and that means you have to get through 23 books of Greek epic first. I would describe getting through those 23 books as the main problem my students face in relation to “The Iliad.”</td>

      <td>A strikingly odd aspect of your editorial “Return of the Obama Economists” (Dec. 1) is that only two of the five “economists” mentioned actually are economists. Cecilia Rouse and Janet Yellen are true economists. Ms. Rouse is first-rate and a highly respected expert in labor economics and the economics of education. Ms. Yellen has had a long career as both an academic economist and maker of economic policy. Her extensive practical experience in making economic policy counts for a lot. Although her Keynesian understanding of macroeconomics is literally half a century out of date, she is a serious economist. Of the other members of the Biden team, at least two have literally no academic training in economics, business or finance. Jared Bernstein has degrees in music, philosophy and social work. Brian Deese has a political science degree and a law degree. Neera Tanden has a law degree. Why would anyone think such people will offer better economic analysis than, say, the supermarket butcher or a taxicab driver? Why would anyone call them economists? To do so is to insult the entire economics profession.<br />The purpose of the Council of Economic Advisers, the National Economic Council and so on is to add coherent economic analysis to the babble of often economically nonsensical policy suggestions that continually emanate from government departments and lobbying groups. Unfortunately, the majority of this team have no qualifications to do that. What Joe Biden needs for competent economic advice are genuine economists or people otherwise trained in business and finance, not social activists who are economists only by self-description.<br />Em.

      <td>An exhibition at the Katonah Museum of Art spotlights ceramic works of the past century that speak to Japan’s traditional style and technique.</td>
      <td>Katonah, N.Y.<br />In Kato Tsubusa’s 3-foot-tall sculpture, “Object,” you can feel the ceramist stretching, slicing and pinching the thick slabs of white porcelaneous clay that rise into a soaring, ragged peak—and sense the slow pouring of pale celadon glaze so that it flows down the sides and pools at the base like melted snow. In Maeta Akihiro’s white porcelain pot, however, the artist’s hand is invisible. After shaping the small mouth, tapering the base, flaring and faceting the body, the artist ran a blade over the surface, erasing all traces of his fingers and palm. The result is a work whose heft and purity of form exude calm.<br />Such contrasts abound in “Hands & Earth: Perspectives on Japanese Contemporary Ceramics”—and so do affinities, subtle connections and jaw-dropping displays of mastery. Of the 35 ceramists featured, seven have been deemed Living National Treasures, many have received prestigious awards, and all have met with critical success.<br />This is not intended as a comprehensive overview of Japan’s ceramics scene. There’s no bling, no playfulness, no manga or anime imagery. That’s because the show, which originated at the Lowe Art Museum in Miami and is currently on view at the Katonah Museum of Art, draws its 41 works from the private collection of Carol and Jeffrey Horvitz, who have acquired ceramics they deem “clearly Japanese, clearly contemporary, and that spoke to a traditional style and technique in Japan,” as Mr. Horvitz states in the catalog. (The exhibition will travel to the University of Georgia on June 12, 2021, and the Crocker Museum on Jan. 22, 2022.)<br />A number of the artists come from a long line of potters, some stretching back to the late 16th century, when Koreans—captured by Japanese invading forces—revolutionized the field. They introduced porcelain production along with, among other things, kilns that allowed for more control during firings, a number of glazing techniques, and an appreciation for slight asymmetries and imperfections. This coincided with the codification of the tea ceremony, which prized rustic ceramics over the refined and polished wares adopted from China. In the 1920s, ceramists reprised this preference with the mingei, or folk craft, movement, whose influence comes through in a number of pieces as does an ongoing fascination with historical glazes and experiments with porcelain. The works span about eight decades starting in 1937, with almost half made between 2010 and 2016.</td>

      <td>A $30 million restoration of Houston’s Rothko Chapel features updated acoustics and lighting that showcase as never before the 14 canvases that line its walls.</td>
      <td>Houston<br />The Rothko Chapel is a windowless brick octagon, 48 feet in diameter, whose sole source of light is a central oculus. It is a somber chamber of shadows and the 14 paintings by Mark Rothko that surround it are themselves shadows, rectangles of black or deep plum. It ought to be as inviting as the bottom of a well. And yet it is unexpectedly uplifting, and it seems to speak not of despair and oblivion but of the human spirit in all its proud, frail dignity.<br />The chapel, which opened in February 1971, has just completed its $30 million restoration by the Architecture Research Office (ARO) of New York. That restoration is subtle to the point of invisibility. The walls have been strengthened, the entrance vestibule uncluttered, and the acoustics and lighting immeasurably improved, while Rothko’s paintings themselves were left untouched. As it happens, they are the principal beneficiaries of the restoration.<br />The idea of the chapel dates to 1964, when John and Dominique de Menil, Houston’s celebrated art patrons, visited Rothko’s New York studio. They saw there the murals that he created for the Four Seasons and famously refused to deliver to the restaurant, not wanting the “rich bastards” who were its customers to enjoy them. The Menils made him a better offer, to create a new cycle of paintings for a building where they would not be incidental decoration but the main point. They combined the commission with another of their projects, the gift of a chapel to Houston’s University of St. Thomas, whose art department Dominique then headed. Their architect was Philip Johnson, whose house for the Menils was one of his first realized buildings.<br />To the surprise of no one, Rothko and Johnson did not play well together. In 1967 the commission was taken from Johnson and given to Howard Barnstone and Gene Aubry, who executed his scheme with only minor modifications. The Menils and the university also parted ways, and in 1968, before construction began, their chapel became an independent institution that would be open to nondenominational use and private contemplation, and would also stress civil rights. Over the years it has happily accommodated every type of service, from Jewish weddings to Zoroastrian purification rites. This is the great paradox of the chapel, that a building and a cycle of paintings designed explicitly for Catholic worship should make everyone feel at home.</td>

      <td>U.S. authorities are scrutinizing the social-media giant’s acquisition history and how it selected its targets</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.,  for the first time, is facing antitrust lawsuits in its home market. On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of attorneys general accused the Menlo Park, Calif., company of abusing its market position to squelch competition. The lawsuits scrutinize Facebook’s acquisition strategy and its motivations to buy companies such as WhatsApp and Instagram. Here’s a look at some of Facebook’s key deals.<br />Deal rationale: In April 2012, Facebook announced that it would buy Instagram for about $1 billion in cash and stock. (At closing, the deal’s value was $736 million.) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was nervous about a new crop of mobile-oriented social-media upstarts that were nibbling away at Facebook’s user base as consumers were shifting to mobile phones, an area where the company was weak.<br />What Facebook has done with it: Instagram has become one of the crown jewels in Facebook’s empire because of its rapid growth and a user base that is younger than that of its flagship Facebook app. The company has continued to add new features to move Instagram beyond photo sharing, and it has tightened the links between Instagram and Facebook through marketing as well as with technology.<br />Deal rationale: Facebook in 2013 reached a deal to buy Onavo for $120 million in a bid to sharpen its mobile analytics insights. Onavo, which had mobile utility apps, gave Facebook access to private data showing how apps were performing relative to others.<br />What Facebook has done with it: Onavo data was used to help Facebook determine whether to buy WhatsApp in 2014, Mr. Zuckerberg said during a congressional hearing this year. Onavo also helped Facebook track other rivals and examine new product categories, people familiar with the product have said.</td>

They were met with a skeptical reception Wednesday.<br />The case arises from the government’s 2012 decision to channel nearly all of Fannie and Freddie’s profits to the Treasury Department, a bid to reclaim more quickly taxpayer dollars that kept the firms afloat after they were bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis.<br />Shareholders argued that the profit sweep should be invalidated because the firms’ regulator—the Federal Housing Finance Agency—is structured unconstitutionally, with a single director who holds power that isn’t subject to appropriate checks by the president.<br />The Supreme Court agreed with similar arguments in a June decision that ordered a restructuring of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.<br />The case could have broad implications for the housing market, because the firms guarantee about half of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market. Fannie and Freddie make money by collecting fees on those guarantees. All told, they have sent more than $300 billion back to the government, compared with the roughly $190 billion it injected into the firms.</td>

Commission staffers had been preparing the lawsuit for months and recommended that the FTC vote to bring a case.<br />“Personal social networking is central to the lives of millions of Americans,” said Ian Conner, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Facebook’s actions to entrench and maintain its monopoly deny consumers the benefits of competition. Our aim is to roll back Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive.”<br />New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James announced the states’ lawsuit, which includes the District of Columbia and Guam. It was also filed in Washington, D.C.</td>

Wall Street banks and electronic trading firms use such data to predict short-term price moves and ensure that they get good prices when buying or selling stocks.<br />Another part of the SEC’s plan allows upstart versions of the SIPs to compete with the existing feeds, which are operated by the New York Stock Exchange and  Nasdaq Inc.<br />Together, the measures amount to one of the biggest overhauls of the SIPs since the rules governing them were passed in the 1970s. They are also a parting shot by departing SEC Chairman Jay Clayton at big stock-exchange operators that have challenged a number of commission rules during his term.<br />The SEC’s commissioners voted unanimously Wednesday to implement the plan despite opposition from the exchange operators, which could lose lucrative data revenue if the changes spur their customers to ditch their premium data feeds for the cheaper SIPs.</td>

      <td>Congressional Democrats on Wednesday introduced legislation overhauling the U.S. bankruptcy system to make it friendlier to consumers while opening the door to student-loan cancellation, among other proposals.<br />Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) said the proposed bill would streamline bankruptcy filings for individuals and families and reduce filing fees while addressing racial and gender disparities in how bankruptcy laws are applied.<br />Some Democrats, including Sen. Warren, for years have been keen on changing the nation’s consumer bankruptcy laws, which last underwent a major amendment in 2005. President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory raised the odds of a significant revision, though any such proposal would face obstacles in a closely divided Senate. Control of the upper house, which now has 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats, will be determined by the two pivotal Georgia runoff races on Jan. 5.<br />“Our bankruptcy system too often fails to provide financially struggling individuals and families the relief they desperately need,” said Sen. Warren, a former Harvard University bankruptcy professor whose academic writings on bankruptcy helped propel her to prominence in the early 2000s.<br />The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2020 follows a framework put forth by Sen. Warren during the Democratic presidential primary that was later endorsed by President-elect Biden on the campaign trail. The legislation would create a new consumer bankruptcy option, chapter 10, replacing the current chapter 7 and chapter 13 routes individuals use to either liquidate or restructure their debts.</td>

Its net sales rose 7% from a year earlier in the three months to Nov. 1, while adjusted earnings before interest and taxes jumped 18%. U.S. soup sales rose 21% in the quarter. Granted, that is down from 52% growth in the prior quarter, but that was during the summer months. The substantial rise seen in the fall bodes well for peak soup season this winter.<br />Chief Executive Mark Clouse, who took over in January 2019, has often stressed the need to update the soup lineup for contemporary tastes, such as with bone broths and plant-based offerings. So it was somewhat surprising to hear him say Wednesday that Campbell’s stodgy condensed soups were “the hero” in the latest quarter.<br />This was apparently due to increased use for cooking. Families stuck at home during the pandemic are looking for quick and affordable ways to put dinner on the table. Views of Campbell’s website recipes were up 20% from a year earlier in the quarter, Mr. Clouse said. Millennials showed the biggest increase in purchases and repeat purchases of any demographic, he added.<br />Campbell shares, nonetheless, were down 2% Wednesday. Investors might have been disappointed with the company’s guidance for the current quarter of 5% to 7% net sales growth and the same pace in adjusted Ebit. This suggests last quarter’s margin expansion won’t be repeated. But executives said this was partly due to increased marketing planned for the crucial winter quarter.</td>

      <td>Before Beltway politicians sign off on another trillion-dollar stimulus plan, they might want to ponder how the earlier trillions spent by Congress and created by the Federal Reserve are still sloshing through the economy. Covid restrictions from state and local politicians have disrupted the ability of many workers to earn a living, but today’s market action shows there are a few big winners, too. When people are ordered to stay home, they still want to eat.<br />The Journal’s Micah Maidenberg reports:<br />It’s not a knock on the San Francisco-based company led by founder Tony Xu to say that DoorDash was in the right place at the right time when politicians started pumping cash into the economy while closing restaurant dining rooms. DoorDash has achieved the largest share of a competitive U.S. market in food-delivery services. Whether companies are delivering food or anything else, it’s a great time to raise money in capital markets turbo-charged by Washington. But it’s especially good to be doing food delivery in the year of social distancing. Mr. Maidenberg explains:<br />Yet DoorDash has never posted a full-year profit. Investors are so eager to part with their money that many aren’t even demanding a say in how their company will be run:<br />Again, DoorDash is in a sweet spot but the money is easy for all kinds of companies these days whether they are raising equity or debt. Banks are full of cash and so are non-financial companies. All politicians have to do is allow them to lend and invest it--unless the pols would prefer to keep picking lockdown losers along with a few wealthy winners.</td>

The country is on schedule to begin inoculations next week, with a portfolio of vaccine candidates that it argues is among the most diverse among large economies.<br />The F.D.A. is expected to authorize use of the vaccine as early as this weekend, after its own study concluded the two-dose vaccine provided benefits even after just the first injection—cutting the risk of getting Covid-19 by about half. The vaccine was found to be 95% effective after the second dose. The European Medicines Agency has said a decision on either the Pfizer-BioNTech shot or  Moderna Inc.’s  vaccine could come by the end of this month.<br />The U.K. and Bahrain approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine within the past week. Canadian officials said Wednesday they expected to soon issue a decision regarding the Moderna vaccine.<br />“We are not in a race with any other regulator. What we are trying to do is beat this virus,” said Supriya Sharma, senior medical adviser at Canada’s health department. “We expedited the review, but we did not compromise in terms of the safety, efficacy and quality.”</td>

      <td>Investors seem unduly relaxed about a lovers’ spat between IAC and Alphabet’s Google</td>
      <td>Investors new to the  IAC/InterActiveCorp.  story probably know it as a company that kindled online romance through now-independent  Match Group Inc.  They seem unduly relaxed about a lovers’ spat with  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google.<br />On Sunday a Wall Street Journal article brought to light the story of a yearslong relationship between the technology holding company and the search giant that appears more controversial than symbiotic. News emerged this week that Google is mulling penalties against IAC for what one of its internal trust-and-safety teams has deemed misleading practices of some of IAC’s browser extensions. Google could go so far as to ban IAC’s products from its Chrome extensions entirely, according to the Journal’s report, which notes IAC believed such a move would “devastate” a key part of its business.<br />Investors took the news in stride when they saw how little appears to be at risk. While IAC earns money from Google’s ads served in the results across its own search engine MyWay, its browser extension, or Desktop business, accounted for less than a third of its total Search revenue and for only about 5% of its overall revenue in the third quarter. Furthermore, IAC says profit from its Desktop business has fallen nearly 90% over the past three years. Much of that loss seems to be because of changes to how Google syndicates its apps. That business, in other words, already was sinking.<br />But Google’s relationship with IAC goes well beyond browser extensions. According to a proxy statement filed by IAC in April, Google accounted for 27% of IAC’s total revenue last year excluding Match Group. IAC’s third-quarter filing, in which Google appears 35 times, includes nearly an entire page dedicated to its services agreement with Google, noting that it constitutes a “meaningful portion” of its revenue. It also makes clear that IAC earns other advertising revenue from Google outside of that agreement.<br />In other words, Google’s relationship is highly valuable to IAC. But it also appears to be ebbing. IAC’s proxy filing also notes that its business with Google has been declining on the same basis since at least 2017, when it was 38% of its overall revenue. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Google’s business had shrunk to just 17% of IAC’s combined revenue.</td>

      <td>Alphabet Inc.’s  Google said it is planning to lift its ban on political ads on Thursday after a blackout of more than a month because of concerns over election misinformation.<br />Google told advertisers Wednesday it will lift its so-called sensitive event policy and allow ads that mention a current state or federal officeholder or candidate, political party or ballot measure, according to an email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Early voting in the Georgia Senate runoffs begins later this month. The Georgia runoffs on Jan. 5 will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate when President-elect Joe Biden begins his administration.<br />“While we no longer consider the postelection period to be a sensitive event, we will still rigorously enforce our ads policies, which strictly prohibit demonstrably false information that could significantly undermine trust in elections or the democratic process, among other forms of abuse,” Google said in the email.<br />Google, along with  Facebook Inc.,  are the biggest digital ad platforms in political advertising. Political campaigns and groups spent tens of millions of dollars advertising on Google, which owns YouTube, and on Facebook, which also owns Instagram, leading up to the general election to influence voters and get out the vote. But both platforms decided to limit political ads before and after the general election in an effort to tamp down the spread of misinformation.<br />Google said Wednesday in a blog post that it temporarily paused more than 5 million ads referencing the U.S. 2020 election, the candidates, or its outcome as election results were certified.</td>

      <td>On a hunch that this year might be a uniquely fruitful one for finding deals, our wine columnist stalked the aisles at Costco. Here, the best values she flushed out.</td>
      <td>“WE DON’T HAVE any more wine Advent calendars!” said a harried Costco staffer as he rushed by me. I’d just set foot in the Wayne, N.J., Costco, and he’d overheard me say “wine” to my husband.<br />The Costco Advent calendar contains 24 half bottles of various wines and sells for under just $100—if you can find it. Neither wine nor desirable bottles last long on Costco shelves. The tantalizing promise of a find might end in disappointment—or a great bottle of wine. Siobhan Clements, Costco’s northeast re-gional beer, wine and spirits buyer, calls this “the Costco treasure hunt.” The payoff might be a small-production Pinot Noir or Costco’s own sought-after Kirkland-label Rutherford Napa Valley Cabernet.<br />I’ve written about wine shopping at Costco before, but I had particularly high hopes when I undertook my most recent visits to the store. The pandemic has compelled producers to redirect wines destined for restaurants and hotels to retailers instead. Might some of those gems have landed at Costco?<br />According to Chad Sokol, assistant vice president and general merchandise manager for Costco Wine & Spirits, there are both corporate and regional Costco wine, spirit and beer buyers across the country. The northeast region Ms. Clements oversees includes nine states and 35 stores that sell wine (about 80% of all Costcos do), including the Wayne store where I shopped this month.<br />“Some of the brands have been nice surprises, and we’ve been able to get some really good deals,” Ms. Clements said. For example, she had secured a few cases of 2018 Austin Hope Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon, a wine that earned high marks from critics. She couldn’t tell me where all the “deals” ended up, but she did say the Austin Hope wine was in some New Jersey stores.</td>

The current wave by some measures is worse, but markets have barely shrugged.<br />Partly that’s because with effective vaccines headed for approval, the end of the pandemic is in sight. But it also is because governments have tried to apply the lessons of the spring by imposing shorter and less stringent restrictions, or none at all. The economic hit has thus been smaller and more manageable.<br />“We’ve learned a whole lot in terms of how to deal with this pandemic,” Gita Gopinath, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said in an interview Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual summit.<br />She said the virus is being attacked “in a more targeted way”— Lockdowns are reserved for where cases are growing exponentially; higher-risk settings such as restaurants and bars are subject to limitations; and schools, which have proven relatively safe, stay open for the most part.<br />Still, targeted restrictions in Europe haven’t brought infections down as far as in the spring. The U.S. has yet to suffer much economic setback from its current wave, but its limited restrictions have yet to reverse the rise in infections.</td>

All three airlines said in August that they would permanently end flight-change fees for domestic flights.<br />The moves to eliminate the fees, which start at $200 but can run much higher, are an indication of the lengths carriers will go to reassure passengers and compete for their business as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage travel demand. Restoring international travel is a priority for the airline industry, which has lost billions of dollars since the pandemic began.<br />Change fees, long been a pet peeve for passengers, have been lucrative for airlines based in the U.S. The charges brought in $2.8 billion last year, according to the federal Department of Transportation. But executives have said they believe travelers will place more value on flexibility once they return to the skies.<br />Air-travel demand plunged as Covid-19 spread this year and has only partially recovered. International travel has been hardest hit, as government travel restrictions and quarantine requirements have made such trips difficult or impossible. The number of domestic passengers in October fell 60% from a year earlier, while international travelers declined 77%, according to the latest government figures.</td>

      <td>Gold prices fell Wednesday, paring some of the December rally and continuing a stretch of volatility as traders weigh a recent rise in coronavirus cases against upbeat vaccine trial results and prospects for further stimulus.<br />Most actively traded gold futures declined 1.9% to $1,838.50 a troy ounce Wednesday. Prices for the haven metal are still up more than 3% so far in December but remain more than 10% below their record high in August, hurt by a broad rally in stocks and riskier commodities with investor anxiety fading after the U.S. election.<br />Gold is still up more than 20% for the year, making it one of the better-performing major assets in 2020. Investors tend to buy the metal when they are nervous about the outlook for the global economy or geopolitical events like elections. That trend boosted demand earlier in the year, before Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential race and key Republican wins in Senate races combined with hopeful vaccine news to send prices tumbling in November.<br />Traders had anticipated that a “blue-wave” scenario in which Mr. Biden won the presidential election and Democrats won control of the Senate would boost gold by unleashing much larger stimulus programs on the economy. Investors also use the metal to protect against rising inflation and a weakening dollar, so that scenario was seen as more positive for bullion.<br />Instead, Republicans performed better than many analysts expected, meaning control of the Senate will come down to a pair of runoff elections in Georgia next month. Investors are parsing those races, a rise in coronavirus cases and ongoing stimulus discussions in Washington as gold’s swings continue.</td>

It’s my duty to observe that the supersizing of the U.S. private fleet represents a public health threat and a failure of regulatory and tax policy (I’m looking at you, Section 179 of the IRS Code). On average and at the extreme, SUVs and trucks have gotten too big, too wasteful and there are too many on the road. Don’t buy one.<br />See? Sort of sucks the air out of the room.<br />Another bloc asks my preference among traditional four-door sedans—midsize plus, premium-luxury category, rear or all-wheel drive, $50,000 to $75,000. If these readers are able to charge at home, I advise them to immediately Pass Go, buy a Tesla, and join the 21st century. Otherwise, the usual suspects include  BMW  5 Series,  Mercedes-Benz  E-Class, Lexus GS, Cadillac CT5 and Audi A6.<br />I’m answering all those letters at once. If I were spending my money—the most valuable kind—I’d probably buy the 2021 Genesis G80. And then you write back to say, “The wha…?” Allow me.<br />Genesis is the premium-luxury division of Hyundai, the Korean version of Toyota’s Lexus. For we grizzled veterans of the industry, this is the latest chapter in a story dating back to 2008. Hyundai has struggled to establish luxury credibility in Western markets. These efforts have often been undone by awkward whole-vehicle designs, says I; flagship cars that aspired to look glamorous—lots of brightwork, formal styling—but presented as just a bit naive. The bang-for-buck of cars like the G90 Limousine was undeniable. The warranty coverage was unbeatable. The pride of ownership was just not there.</td>

      <td>State and local aid, liability shield at center of coronavirus-relief debate</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to reach a compromise on a coronavirus relief package was completing a detailed summary Wednesday of much of their $908 billion framework, as Democratic and Republican leaders and the White House continued to wrangle over liability shields and state and local aid.<br />The expanding group, which began with nine senators and leaders of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of 50 House lawmakers, is pulling together a six-page breakdown on items including jobless aid and vaccine distribution, according to copies viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />But, reflecting the broader debate in the Capitol, the group is still working on how to structure the distribution of $160 billion in funding for state and local governments, as well as the single biggest hurdle in the talks: some form of legal protections for businesses and other entities operating during the pandemic.<br />The fleshed-out proposal emerged Wednesday at a time when many competing proposals are ricocheting around the Capitol as lawmakers rush to get a deal done before the end of the year.<br />On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) suggested lawmakers should simply omit the two most controversial issues. Hours later, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin presented a new $916 billion White House proposal to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) that included both state and local funding, as well as liability protections, but dropped the $300 a week in enhanced unemployment insurance and put in $600 direct checks to many Americans.</td>

      <td>WHILE PICKING the ideal pine is a beloved holiday tradition for many—with 26.2 million real Christmas trees sold nationwide last year—the logistics can prove a hassle, especially if you want to bring it home from the countryside.<br />Add a global pandemic and stringent social distancing guidelines, and many real-tree devotees say they simply don’t have the comfort level much less transportation, manpower, or, really, inclination in 2020 to schlep a festive fir from its natural habitat.<br />Enter on-demand tree-delivery services that aim to simplify the season by bringing a fresh, fragrant evergreen directly from the farm to your front door. In 2019, online delivery services accounted for 1.5 million real-tree sales, a number that should see a significant uptick this year, according to the National Christmas Tree Association.<br />Chicago marketing consultant Jessica Sturdy, 31, plans to order a $250 Fraser Fir—including setup, stand rental and postseason recycling—from City Tree Delivery (citytreedelivery.com) this month, reassured by its new, contactless drop-off options. “And I physically could not carry a tree into my apartment alone,” she said.<br />Urban dwellers like Ms. Sturdy represent a massive market for tree transporters, as do harried professionals, retirees, young families and snowbirds who no longer have access to the tree lots that are ubiquitous up north. Windblown Tree Plantation, which operates Christmas Trees Now (christmastreesnow.com), has shipped to customers in 48 states—even Hawaii.</td>

      <td>China’s consumer prices dropped for the first time in over a decade in November, though economists say the decrease doesn’t signal faltering demand in the world’s second-largest economy.<br />The fall was driven by volatile food prices, including the continued retreat of pork prices as supply recovers from the ravages of African swine fever. Other economic indicators have shown a continued recovery from Covid-19 shocks.<br />China’s consumer-price index in November was down 0.5% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday, after a 0.5% rise in October. It was the first negative reading since October 2009. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast November’s CPI would come in flat.<br />The statistics bureau said food prices, down 2.0% from a year earlier, weighed heavily on November’s headline CPI. In October, food prices were up 2.2% from a year earlier.<br />Among foods, pork—the main source of protein in the Chinese diet—extended its decline, down 12.5% in November after October’s 2.8% drop.</td>

      <td>The U.S. is in danger of losing its dominant leadership position in global financial services.</td>
      <td>The U.S. remains the dominant force in the financial-services industry, leading in nearly every area of finance, from venture capital and private equity to banking and asset management. The liquidity and scale of U.S. capital markets support the primacy of the dollar, which allows Americans to pay less for foreign goods and helps finance U.S. government spending. America’s financial leadership, however, is increasingly being challenged by fierce competition from abroad and by shortsighted and counterproductive policies at home. Maintaining U.S. financial pre-eminence should be a priority for the Biden administration.<br />Traditionally, challenges to American leadership have come from well-established financial centers like London, Hong Kong and Tokyo. But mainland China will be an increasingly formidable challenger in financial services in the next few years.<br />The last-minute cancellation last month of Ant Group’s planned initial public offering—which would have been the largest in history, raising some $34 billion—reminded many investors about the risks of the Chinese market. But the deal’s size also showed China’s ability to attract massive amounts of capital. Despite the stumble, China’s domestic exchanges are well-positioned for the future.<br />China lags behind the advanced financial centers, but it has belatedly begun to open up and attract best-in-class foreign financial institutions. Its markets have governance and accounting issues to overcome, but Beijing is working to enhance its regulatory structure to meet global standards and provide greater transparency and better enforcement. China’s relatively quick recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic without a major fiscal stimulus has also allowed it to maintain higher interest rates and a stronger currency. This is attracting large investment inflows to Chinese stocks and other securities. Shanghai ranked first among global exchanges for number of IPOs and capital raised through the first nine months of 2020. These IPOs show that major fundraising can take place outside the U.S. financial ecosystem.<br />At the same time China is working to attract global capital, the U.S. is moving in the opposite direction. Ultimately, the strength of America’s capital markets rests on trust in the country’s stable macroeconomic and fiscal policies, and in the resilience of its open political system.</td>

      <td>Think U.S. lockdowns are bad? Imagine being confined to your town.</td>
      <td>Milan<br />If U.S. states’ lockdowns are too onerous for you, be thankful you’re not in Italy. In November Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte promised that “if we respect the rules, we’ll have a serene Christmas.” Italians largely complied but didn’t get their reward. Now Mr. Conte says it’ll be “a different Christmas, but not less authentic.”<br />Covid-19 hit Italy early and hard. With more than 60,000 deaths and a case-fatality rate of 3.5% (compared with 1.95% in the U.S., 2.57% in Sweden and 2.4% in France), it is clearly a country where things went wrong. In the spring, when the epidemic was concentrated in the North, the country implemented the strictest lockdown in the Western world. It seemed to succeed, and Italians had an uneasy summer, with enclaves of normalcy. Some went to the beach; some hiked mountains; some even went clubbing. In October infections began to rise again.<br />The government fears that Christmas festivities will spread the virus, so it is imposing severe travel restrictions. Residents already aren’t free to move through the national territory, a constitutional right in Italy as in any liberal democracy. They may travel only within their regions—Italy has 20 of them—or between regions that are classified as having a similar risk status. On Dec. 25 and 26 and Jan. 1, all Italians will be confined to their municipalities.<br />The rationale for the new measures lies in the fear that people may move out of the larger cities to join their relatives and have large gatherings, therefore causing a new infection spike. Attilio Fontana, governor of the Northern region of Lombardy, cautioned against a new “exodus” to the South, as the descendants of migrants make their customary reunions in their places of origin. As Southern health care is weaker when it comes to intensive-care units, there is reason to worry.</td>

The 10-part show, which premiered Dec. 6, stars Bryan Cranston as a spotless New Orleans judge who betrays his ethical code by covering up a hit-and-run involving his son.<br />Alon Aranya, an executive producer on “Your Honor,” helped shepherd the series to American TV. He says the original Israeli version, “Kvodo,” was made for a fraction of what the U.S. version cost and that its remake rights have also been sold to India, France, Russia, Germany and Italy.<br />Mr. Aranya, 49, has executive produced several U.S. television remakes of popular Israeli shows, including the CBS series “Hostages” (2013-14) about a doctor whose family is taken hostage as she is about to perform an operation on the U.S. president, which he also co-wrote. However he says his focus has become more international since 2017 when he set up his company Paper Plane Productions with offices in Los Angeles, Tel Aviv and the Netherlands.<br />Earlier this year, Paper Plane co-produced “Tehran,” which became AppleTV+’s first international show. The 8-part espionage thriller shot mostly in Farsi was co-written by “Fauda” screenwriter Moshe Zonder. Since its September premiere Messrs. Zonda and Aranya each signed first-look development deals with AppleTV+.<br />Mr. Aranya spoke to the WSJ about picking winners and the inherent jeopardy in Israeli dramas.

      <td>Limited supply of new Xbox and PlayStation consoles will slow retailer’s reboot</td>
      <td>GameStop ’s  race to slim down has seen some success. But investors binged too early on a complicated recovery story.<br />The videogame retailer posted disappointing third-quarter results late Tuesday. Revenue for the quarter ended Oct. 31 slid 30% year over year to just over $1 billion—about 7% short of Wall Street’s estimates. Moreover, the company declined to give a forecast for the current period, which should be a strong one given the launch of new Xbox and PlayStation consoles in early November. GameStop’s share price slumped more than 17% Wednesday morning.<br />Those consoles come at a crucial time for the struggling retailer. Once the pre-eminent destination for videogame products, GameStop’s business has been severely disrupted by the rapid digitization of the industry. Analysts estimate that anywhere from a third to half of all games sold now are digital downloads. That limits GameStop’s ability to get a piece of the initial sale, as many of those sales are by the publisher directly or on console-based platforms such as Xbox Live. That also cuts down on future sales of preowned games—historically GameStop’s largest source of profits.<br />Hence, game hardware such as consoles and related equipment have become key to getting customers into GameStop’s shrinking store base. But the consoles themselves are very hard to get right now, as booming demand has met limited supply. Retailers are sold out everywhere, and the black market is booming.  Sony ’s  PlayStation 5 is currently fetching about $2,000 on  eBay —four times its retail price. GameStop Chief Executive Officer George Sherman predicted Tuesday on GameStop’s earnings call that the new consoles will generate “great carryforward demand into the entirety of next year and beyond.”<br />But GameStop’s share price had nearly tripled for the year heading into yesterday’s report, as investors have been anticipating a big recovery in sales led by the new machines. The stock is also a favorite target of short sellers, adding to its volatility. As a retailer with a red-hot product, GameStop should have its merriest Christmas in years. But failure to get enough of the new consoles on its shelves could still leave a lump of coal for investors.</td>

IV ,  a blank-check company run by former banker Michael Klein, and private-equity firm TPG, the people said.  Apollo Global Management Inc.,  long seen by many as the front-runner to buy DirecTV, submitted a bid valuing the business at less than $15 billion, some of the people said.<br />The auction is in a late stage and should the company reach a deal with one of the suitors, it could be completed by early next year.<br />A deal could allow AT&T to deconsolidate DirecTV’s worsening financial results—a major aim of the transaction—while relinquishing control even as it maintains a majority stake in the business.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported in August that AT&T had tapped bankers to explore a deal to take the fast-shrinking business off its books. The media-and-telecom company bought DirecTV in 2015 for about $49 billion, or $66 billion including debt. (Its Latin American satellite business, also acquired through the DirecTV takeover, is now held in a separate unit called Vrio.)</td>

      <td>A longtime devotee of the celebrated globe-trotter on her remarkable life and career</td>
      <td>IN 2003, I was handed my first assignment as a fledgling public-radio producer: editing an interview for a program called “The Savvy Traveler.” It was a conversation between the show’s host, Diana Nyad, and celebrated British journalist, historian and travel writer Jan Morris. It took me days. Partly because I’d never used audio-editing software before. But mainly because the raw tape was so enthralling I couldn’t bear to cut anything out.<br />Morris, who died on Nov. 20 of this year, talked about how, at age 26, she joined the 1953 expedition that first summited Mount Everest—the only reporter on the team. When Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the peak, Morris was determined to send word back to Britain quickly and secretly, to avoid getting scooped. That required her to scramble 22,000 feet down the mountain in growing darkness, and then find a sherpa to speed a coded message 20 miles south, to the nearest village with a long-distance radio. The exclusive hit the London Times on the eve of Elizabeth II’s coronation. Brits danced in the streets at the news. That was just the beginning of Jan Morris’s career.<br />She went on to write innumerable articles and travelogues about innumerable countries, always seeming to touch down at exactly the moment a place became incredibly interesting. She toured the U.S. in its post-World War II heyday. She visited Cuba just after the revolution (“This sugar and bikini state,” she marveled, “has lurched so far from the American ideal that people can seriously talk of it as a potential Russian satellite”). As for her favorite place, Venice—“that paragon among landfalls”—she never needed an excuse to visit, documenting it repeatedly down to the last detail. Of all her travel books, she told Diana Nyad, her favorite was “A Venetian Bestiary,” a slim volume cataloging the city’s smattering of animal life, from alley cats to the winged lion statue in Piazza San Marco.<br />She traveled nearly everywhere and was paid to write about what she saw. The story of her most personal journey—transitioning, in her late 30s, from her assigned male gender to female—became a groundbreaking memoir (1974’s “Conundrum”). In short, hers was the kind of life and career that newbie journalists like me aspired to. As soon as I finished cutting Morris’s Savvy Traveler interview, I swiped the show’s copy of her essay compendium “The World: Travels 1950-2000,” eager to be swept away by trenchant tales of her globe-trotting adventures.<br />But the essay in the book that really stuck with me hit far closer to home. I was surprised to discover Morris had even bothered to write about my adopted hometown of Los Angeles. I figured a lover of Venice would find L.A. a comparatively ugly, shallow snooze. And according to Morris, when she first visited in 1954, that was in fact her general impression. “I had introductions, then, to the Hollywood film community,” she writes, “But had gone away thinking it was a rather silly and superficial place.”</td>

      <td>Some Asian countries that have been among the world’s most successful at containing Covid-19 are now struggling to beat back a winter resurgence, a sign of how elusive sustained progress can be until a vaccine gets rolled out widely.<br />On Wednesday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in convened an emergency meeting after the country saw a nine-month peak of 686 cases that has forced officials to use shipping containers to address a hospital-bed shortage. Japan on Wednesday recorded more than 2,800 new cases, according to public broadcaster NHK, its highest daily total yet.<br />Vietnam reported community infections for the first time in around three months, prompting authorities to suspend all inbound commercial flights. Hong Kong, which had taken daily infections down to single digits, has seen cases surge past 100, requiring the reintroduction of limits on dine-in restaurant service and gym closures. Several regions of Malaysia went into lockdown after cases doubled within a month.<br />“We have overcome coronavirus crises several times but now we are in a more serious situation than ever,” said Mr. Moon, during a meeting with officials earlier this week. He called for expanded coronavirus testing, prompting testing sites to extend working hours and reopen drive-through sites.<br />Though the virus tallies pale in comparison with the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, the uptick in outbreaks among Asia’s Covid-19 success stories comes after life had been restored to pre-pandemic levels. But unlike more isolated outbreaks of prior months, this winter upturn is more diffuse, as places once considered havens—a family gathering at home or work sites long reopened—are now the outbreak origins.</td>

The 2019-20 season only finished in late September after being interrupted in March.<br />To get moving again, the league needs about a three-week ramp up to allow players to quarantine upon repatriating to their home markets and then participate in training camps, according to people familiar with the matter.

However, that was less than half the gains Campbell reported for the prior three months. Supermarket operator Kroger Co. last week also reported slower sales growth than during the first months of the pandemic.<br />Campbell Chief Executive Mark Clouse said Wednesday that he expects people to continue eating more at home even after the pandemic ends. He said some people have become better cooks and that some will likely continue working more from home long-term.<br />“We do not see this as a kind of episodic moment,” he said on a call with investors.<br />The pandemic has provided food makers with an unprecedented opportunity for millions of people to try their products for the first time in years. Like other food makers, Campbell has invested in more advertising to try to maintain the momentum. The company said many of its new customers are young people returning to its soup and snacks.</td>

      <td>And who can fault her when no other EU leader has a better idea?</td>
      <td>Mario Draghi’s rubric during his presidency of the European Central Bank was “whatever it takes.” His successor Christine Lagarde has been forced to adopt a different version: “whatever we can.” That’s the best read on the expansion of pandemic bond purchases likely to be announced Thursday.<br />The Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, PEPP, was born in March and has expanded to a €1.35 trillion quantitative-easing program under which the ECB commits to buy government and corporate bonds at least through June 2021. It’s also the only eurozone-wide response to the pandemic that’s made it past the starting line. A Brussels plan for €750 billion in spending on welfare and public works is bogged down in political wrangling.<br />Absent action from other political leaders, it’s back to Frankfurt for more help. Investors expect an expansion in monetary aid this week—maybe another €500 billion—and an extension into 2022.<br />Don’t ask what practical effect this might have, because the answer is not much. The ECB already isn’t on track to fully implement PEPP as it is. At the current pace of monthly purchases, it would have money left over when the program is due to expire in June.<br />Nor is Europe suffering a financial panic. Ms. Lagarde, with her peers at the world’s other major central banks, performed her most important function in the spring when ECB action prevented the virus contagion from spreading to the financial system. Interest rates have since gone into lockdown. Yields on government bonds have turned negative even in such fiscal laggards as Portugal, and Italy is near historic lows.</td>

      <td>Investment represents latest details from social-media company, which last year committed $1 billion to ease affordable-housing shortage in Bay Area</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.  said $150 million of its previously announced planned investment of $1 billion in affordable housing will go toward homes for the lowest-income tier in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br />The Menlo Park, Calif., company said on Wednesday that this installment would be used to fund housing projects in five Bay Area counties that include units for residents making no more than 30% of the area’s median income.<br />These levels differ by metro area. In San Mateo County, where Facebook is based, 30% of the area median income is $52,200 for a family of four, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.<br />“This is extremely low-income housing, which is a particularly acute need during the Covid crisis and also an area which has suffered a lot from the underbuilding that we’ve had in California over the past several decades,” said David Wehner, Facebook’s chief financial officer.<br />This investment represents the latest details from Facebook, which in October last year said it was providing $1 billion to help ease a shortage of affordable housing in Silicon Valley. Facebook said it expects its fund to support the development of at least 2,000 units targeted at extremely low-income residents.</td>

      <td>Star power of dictator’s sister has risen after appearances at 2018 Winter Olympics, two nuclear summits and as a signatory in state media</td>
      <td>Kim Yo Jong, 32 years old, is a senior North Korean official helping oversee the country’s policies toward the U.S. and South Korea, according to Seoul’s intelligence agency.<br />She is a full member of North Korea’s Politburo and often at her brother’s side during key events in the one-party state. Among her various titles, Ms. Kim is the nominal head of the North’s propaganda and agitation department. She rose to prominence in just the past several years, attending all three face-to-face meetings between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as the latter’s confidante and adviser.<br />In 2020, she began signing off on official government statements that criticized Washington’s insistence on complete denuclearization of her country, and Seoul’s failure to rein in North Korean defectors who sent antiregime leaflets over the two Koreas’ shared border.<br />Kim Yo Jong’s precise date of birth is unknown, though South Korea’s Unification Ministry database of North Korean officials lists her as being born in 1988 in Pyongyang. She is the younger sister of Kim Jong Un and the youngest-known daughter of their father Kim Jong Il, who ruled North Korea from 1994 to 2011 and had children with several women. During her earliest years, Ms. Kim was an obscure figure. But that changed in 2009, when Kim Jong Un was rumored to have been named heir to the North Korean leadership, after their father suffered a series of strokes. That year, a side-by-side photograph was shown on state media, showing a presumed image of her, alongside Kim Jong Un and their eldest full brother, Kim Jong Chol. News cameras also spotted her in early 2011, when she attended an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore with Jong Chol.<br />Her marital status is unknown, though some South Korean news outlets have mentioned she may have married the son of a prominent North Korean official, Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Jong Un’s deputy in the state affairs commission—the government’s most-powerful decision-making apparatus. She hasn’t been publicly seen with a husband in North Korean state media. Ms. Kim steadily gained international prominence as Kim Jong Un accelerated North Korea’s nuclear weapons development over the past decade, participating in nuclear negotiations involving the U.S. and South Korea since 2018. In 2020, when her brother was rumored to be seriously ill, North Korea experts mentioned her as a possible emergency backup, if her brother abruptly died, or was incapacitated.</td>

      <td>Why airlines are actually scheduling more long-haul trips in December despite low passenger demand and Covid-driven entry restrictions</td>
      <td>The lesson is clear: No matter the obstacles, there will always be people (and cargo) who will fly.<br />Airlines have added a number of very long international flights to schedules in December, a sign of resilience and necessity in air travel. Some of the new flights are a result of increased holiday travel and cargo demand in key cities. Many will have small passenger loads—30 or 40 people on a wide-body jet. But with the right cargo load, that’s enough to at least break even on many trips, airlines say.<br />That also could mean nine, 12, even 18 hours in an enclosed space in the middle of the pandemic, a choice many would-be fliers have avoided. Robust ventilation and air filtration in cabins does reduce, but not eliminate, viral transmission risk. Even with the risks, quarantines and restrictions, the increased flying just shows that there will always be people who need to go.<br />“Air service is critical. People want to travel—even with a 14-day quarantine, even with all the testing—and these vital travel lanes are key to having those connections,’’ says Patrick Quayle, vice president of international network and alliances at United.<br />The number of scheduled passenger flights at least 3,400 miles long—New York-London is 3,451 miles—jumped 23% to 32,317 world-wide in December compared with November, according to Cirium, an aviation data company. December schedules still had 70% fewer flights than December 2019, but the number of flights scheduled was three times as many as the May low for long-haul international trips.</td>

      <td>LONDON—Two of the first people vaccinated in the U.K. on Tuesday with the  Pfizer Inc. -BioNTech SE shot responded adversely to the injection, the country’s National Health Service said, prompting the regulator to issue new guidance warning those with a history of significant allergic reactions against having the inoculation.<br />“Both are recovering well,” said Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS.<br />The two people are NHS workers, part of the first tranche to receive the vaccine in line with front-line staff having initial access. Each of them carried an adrenaline auto-injector to deal with their allergies.<br />The U.K. is the first Western country to authorize a Covid-19 vaccine and on Tuesday began its vaccination program with priority recipients including health-care staff, people over 80 years old and residents and staff in nursing homes.<br />The chief executive of the Medical and Health products Regulatory Agency, the body that last week gave the go-ahead for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination to be rolled out across the U.K., told lawmakers on Wednesday that on Tuesday evening it examined two cases of allergic reactions that hadn’t been a feature of the extensive clinical trials of the vaccine.</td>

      <td>DUBAI—A Chinese vaccine candidate showed to be 86% effective in protecting people against Covid-19 in late-stage trials, the United Arab Emirates said, a positive sign for the fight against the virus in the developing world.<br />However, health experts cautioned that more information was needed on the Phase 3 trials. The efficacy rate announced by authorities in the U.A.E., where the trials took place, would put the vaccine above the 50% threshold that international scientists deem necessary to protect people. Candidates developed by Moderna Inc. and jointly by  Pfizer Inc.  and BioNTech SE have shown to have efficacy rates of 94.5% and 95% in the final stages of testing, respectively.<br />The U.A.E. Health Ministry didn’t disclose how many trial participants developed Covid-19 and how many of those received a placebo or a vaccine. It also wasn’t known whether the data was peer reviewed.<br />The results were the first from Phase 3 trials of a Chinese Covid-19 vaccine. Nearly one million Chinese people have already received the shot, which was developed by state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm, after the government granted emergency-use authorization for it in July.<br />Public-health experts said that the headline figure suggested that the world had another working vaccine option, although more details were needed. Some questioned why Sinopharm hadn’t jointly presented the results.</td>

      <td>U.S. stock futures edged higher Wednesday, suggesting that the major indexes may grind toward new all-time highs after the opening bell, as investors bet on fresh fiscal stimulus spending.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked up 0.1% a day after the benchmark notched its 30th record close for this year. Nasdaq-100 futures slid less than 0.1%, indicating that technology stocks may be subdued after the New York opening bell.<br />Investors are optimistic Congress will pass another coronavirus relief package to bolster the economic recovery as rising infections prompt restrictions on social and business activity. The Trump administration proposed a $916 billion package on Tuesday after Democrats rejected an effort by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to narrow the scope of the bill.<br />“It does look to me like we are inching toward a deal,” said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “The market reaction is highlighting what we’ve heard from central bankers: fiscal stimulus is the best way to support the economy and monetary policy can only do so much.”<br />Lawmakers appear to be facing pressure to offer aid to those who have been hardest hit by the pandemic as infection levels and hospitalizations rise across the country. The U.S. reported more than 215,000 new cases for Tuesday. Some states have introduced fresh restrictions, triggering concern that the economic recovery could falter in the winter months.</td>
