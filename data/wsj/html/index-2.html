      <td>Hundreds march in Havana and other cities amid a hard-currency shortage and rising coronavirus infections</td>
      <td>Hundreds of Cubans took to the streets in a wave of demonstrations in Havana and at least six other cities throughout the Communist island, demanding an end to the 62-year dictatorship and protesting the lack of food and Covid-19 vaccines.<br />“We are not afraid! We are not afraid!” people shouted as they marched through the streets on Sunday, videos posted on social media showed. “Freedom! Freedom!”<br />The protests are unprecedented in a country with tight police control and surveillance on dissidents, analysts say.<br />In a televised address on Sunday, President Miguel Díaz-Canel blamed the protests on the U.S., which he said seeks to economically strangle Cuba and bring about a social explosion. Mr. Díaz-Canel called on government supporters to take to the streets. “The order for combat has been given,” he said.<br />On his Twitter account Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez said Mr. Díaz-Canel visited the city of San Antonio de los Baños, about 20 miles from Havana, to rally pro-government supporters. Another tweet on Mr. Rodríguez’s account showed a video of pro-government demonstrators marching in Havana behind a Cuban flag shouting: “These streets belong to Fidel,” a reference to the late Cuban leader, Fidel Castro.</td>

      <td>Most poor countries put all hands on deck in this crisis. Havana exports its doctors.</td>
      <td>Cubans poured into the streets Sunday to protest the government’s handling of the Covid crisis. As the virus races across Cuba, independent lawyers, medical professionals and civil-society groups on the island have begged Havana to allow international humanitarian aid to reach people directly. The regime refuses. Now the crisis is near cataclysmic proportions.<br />Havana wants the world to believe that Cuban hardship in healthcare is caused by the U.S. embargo. But food and medicine are exempt from the embargo. As Julie Chung, now acting assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, tweeted in April 2020 that the U.S. “routinely authorizes the export of humanitarian goods, agricultural products, medicine, and medical equipment to support the Cuban people.” Ms. Chung further noted that in 2019 the U.S. exported millions of dollars of medical goods to Cuba.<br />Cuba’s real problem is that it’s broke. And while all poor countries in the region have struggled to serve the public during Covid-19, only Cuba has made things worse by trying to use the pandemic as a way to earn hard currency for the ruling elite and boost its legitimacy around the world.<br />Shortages of medications for treatable illnesses in Cuba are routine. The contagious mite infestation of the skin known as scabies, for example, can be remedied with antibiotics and topical medicines like permethrin. Yet Cuban public-health officials have been helpless to stop it from spreading across the island.<br />“It’s horrible and exasperating to see your children sick, and not be able to do anything because there are no medications,” a mother in the city of Mayarí told the newspaper Diario de Cuba in February. “I went to the hospital and there’s nothing to cure it either. It’s a tragedy.”</td>

      <td>Europe starts the bidding on CO2 tariffs. Will Biden follow?</td>
      <td>Western politicians have failed to persuade their own voters to commit economic suicide by banning fossil fuels, and forget about China, Russia or India. The climate lobby’s fallback, which is starting to emerge, is to punish the foreigners and their own consumers with climate tariffs.<br />Bureaucrats at the European Commission are due to unveil the proposed Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) later this month, but a draft recently leaked. Brussels wants to impose tariffs to bring the cost of carbon-dioxide emissions tied to an imported good into line with what a European producer would pay to produce the same good.<br />This is an admission that the European Union’s emissions-trading scheme (ETS) is bad for the economy. European companies are less competitive because they have to pay for their emissions and foreign companies don’t. Environmentalists say the ETS encourages companies to send production offshore to avoid the ETS, which greens call “carbon leakage” and most people would call common sense. The CBAM is intended to level the playing field, at least within the European market.<br />Even on those terms, the draft plan is a failure. It starts small, applying at first to a handful of industries such as iron, steel and fertilizers. And it doesn’t account fully for environmental compliance costs. The CBAM will be tied to the cost of tradable emissions permits, but it won’t factor in the expenses European companies bear for a complex web of green subsidies, feed-in tariffs and the like that increase energy costs at factories.<br />The bigger problems are that a carbon tariff would impose an enormous burden on companies seeking to sell to the EU—even the low-emitting firms—and as a result probably will trigger a trade war. China, India, Brazil and South Africa are already objecting.</td>

      <td>The White House floats a needless change to a useful diplomatic tool.</td>
      <td>President Biden likes to say he wants to restore America’s moral leadership in the world, but sometimes it seems his team at the White House wants to change something merely because Donald Trump supported it.<br />We hope that’s not what’s driving the White House to consider changing the annual proclamation for Captive Nations Week, which is scheduled to take place this year from July 18-24. Every year since 1959 American Presidents have issued a Captive Nations proclamation condemning Soviet and Communist imperialism and repression. The proclamation is issued shortly before the week itself and has featured robust language.<br />We’re told that White House aides this year have been floating the idea of ditching the Captive Nations phrase in favor of “Free and Open Societies Week.” They’ve been calling around to see how that idea would go down with folks who care about America’s moral and diplomatic standing. The answer is not too well.<br />The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, an umbrella group that represents victims of oppression, has sent a letter to Mr. Biden urging him “to demonstrate the commitment of the United States to promoting liberty and human rights” by issuing “a strong 2021 Captive Nations Week proclamation.”<br />The difference here may seem semantic, but the notion of Captive Nations carries a lot more moral weight than “free and open societies.” The former signifies that Communists and authoritarians subjugate entire populations. A change would be especially ill-timed when the Chinese Communist Party has crushed the autonomy it promised to Hong Kong and consigned millions of ethnic Uyghurs to re-education camps. In the contest between democracy and authoritarians, language matters.</td>

His climate model of California is showing the limits and risks of this strategy.<br />California’s Independent System Operator (Caiso) on Friday and Saturday issued emergency alerts urging residents to conserve power during the evenings to avoid rolling blackouts. A wildfire in Oregon threatened transmission lines that import thousands of megawatts of hydropower that are needed when the sun starts to go down.<br />Progressives blamed Texas’s power outage in February on its limited ability to import power from other states after its wind turbines froze and not enough natural gas plants could ramp up to compensate. But grids in neighboring states had little power to spare, which was the problem this weekend in California and will continue to be all summer.<br />The California Public Utilities Commission ordered Caiso last month to procure more power for evening hours this summer due to reduced hydropower generation and imports caused by drought. It’s not clear where Caiso plans to get the power since supply is expected to be tight across the Western U.S. for the same reasons.<br />Rest assured, Caiso has a back-up plan: Snatch energy headed elsewhere. Caiso manages interconnections between utilities and power providers across the Western U.S. For instance, Arizona utilities contract with hydropower plants in the Northwest for power that is transmitted through California.</td>

      <td>Ed Husain once defended Islam in terms of Blair-era multiculturalism. Now he invites Muslims to join the ‘British mainstream.’</td>
      <td>The future of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims in the United Kingdom may be a troubled one. Ed Husain sounds the alarm in “Among the Mosques: A Journey Across Muslim Britain.” The book chronicles his visits to 10 cities. Mr. Husain, a British writer and political adviser, takes us into local mosques for Friday prayers and relates his encounters, planned and unplanned, with local personalities in Muslim communities. Some of the communities he visits exhibit the very best British traditions of tolerance and pluralism, but most do not.<br />The Markazi Mosque in the northern mill town of Dewsbury, Mr. Husain writes, “is the European central office of the largest Muslim organisation in the world, the Tableeghi Jamaat.” The original goal of the organization, founded in 1927 in India, was to oppose the British Raj and “to stop the dilution of Muslim identity in the cosmopolitan cities of British India.” Its members are great proselytizers. Knocking on doors across the Muslim world, they are, as Mr. Husain puts it, “essentially the (male-only) Muslim version of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”<br />The annual Tableeghi convention in Bangladesh attracts five million Muslim men from around the world. Women are not welcome. The Tableeghis are particularly prominent in the U.K., where, by Mr. Husain’s count, the Deobandi movement, of which the Tableeghi Jamaat is the missionary arm, controls “more than half of Britain’s mosques.”<br />Like the Muslim Brotherhood, which sprang up in Egypt around the same time, the Tableeghi Jamaat sees modern Western culture as an assault on Islam. To counterattack, it promotes an understanding of Islam that organizes every aspect of life, including politics. Mr. Husain puts it this way: “While political Islamists in the Muslim Brotherhood target the state and seek to change its laws through elections and parliaments, as in Egypt and Syria, and their jihadi cousins in al-Qaeda and ISIS use violence in seeking to restore a caliphate in several Muslim countries, the Tableeghi Jamaat believe in bottom-up change, and work for their caliphate from the masses upwards.”<br />This bottom-up strategy leads to the construction of a parallel society. Banning music and alcohol helps to wall Muslims off from the prevailing British culture, as does the creation of sharia courts that provide members an alternative to the state on matters of personal status, such as marriage and divorce. When Mr. Husain asks a cleric in Dewsbury why there are no women in the mosque, the cleric directs him to a book, “Guidance for a Muslim Wife.” A sample line from that work: “When a woman leaves her home without her husband’s consent, then all the angels of the skies and the entire universe curse her for this act until she returns home.”</td>

      <td>A new report details a culture of bureaucracy and risk-aversion that is corroding readiness.</td>
      <td>Is the U.S. Navy ready for war? A new report prepared by Marine Lt. Gen. Robert Schmidle and Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, both retired, for members of Congress paints a portrait of the Navy as an institution adrift. The report, reviewed exclusively by the Journal, concludes that the surface Navy is not focused on preparing for war and is weathering a crisis in leadership and culture.<br />The impetus for the report was a series of recent catastrophes—a ship burning in San Diego last year; two destroyer collisions in the Pacific in 2017. Were these isolated events? Or did they indicate “larger institutional issues that are degrading the performance of the entire naval surface force”? The report surveyed active and recently retired service members of various ranks, conducting 77 candid hourlong interviews. A key finding: “Many sailors found their leadership distracted, captive to bureaucratic excess, and rewarded for the successful execution of administrative functions” rather than core competencies of war.<br />“I guarantee you every unit in the Navy is up to speed on their diversity training,” said one recently retired senior enlisted leader. “I’m sorry that I can’t say the same of their ship-handling training.”<br />Adm. Montgomery told me in an interview over the weekend that when he was a junior officer in the 1980s there was “an intense focus” on a likely confrontation with the Soviet navy—learning about classes of ships or the missiles aboard. After decades without a peer adversary at sea, “the same focus is not permeating the Navy today.”<br />The Navy has improved its pipeline for surface-warfare officers since the 2017 collisions, reversing a 2003 money-saving mistake of training junior officers by giving them 23 compact discs loaded with reading material. But the Navy doesn’t spend the money and time training surface warfare officers that it does submariners or aviators, and has revamped training so many times, usually in an effort to spend even less money, that commanding officers are left with “inconsistent, often ill-prepared wardrooms.”</td>

      <td>‘Limousine liberals” have driven full circle—or rather the term has returned to its origins. Coined in 1969 by Mario Procaccino, the Democratic Party’s unsuccessful challenger to New York Mayor John Lindsay, the epithet described “hypocritical wealthy do-gooders insulated from the negative fallout of their bad ideas,” in historian David Callahan’s definition.<br />“This theme,” Mr. Callahan has written, “remained a staple of conservative attacks.” Sen. Ted Kennedy was a classic example. He sent his kids to exclusive private schools at the same time he was telling working-class whites to bus their kids to distressed schools in the slums.<br />In this year’s New York mayor’s race, the limousine-liberal attack came from the left again, with the help of a conservative tabloid. The target was Maya Wiley, who was endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and finished either second or third in the June 22 Democratic primary.<br />“She’s not Maya from the block,” began a June 19 New York Post story. She’s emphasized “her progressive bona fides and hard-bitten personal story. But it’s a tale that has often required looking past a number of silver spoons, and alleged hypocrisy.”<br />Among other things, the Post noted that Ms. Wiley earned as much as $300,000 a year as a college administrator and lives in “a historic Prospect Park South estate valued at $2.7 million,” and that, like Kennedy, she enrolled one of her daughters in “an elite private school.”</td>

      <td>American forces have left Afghanistan. Now what? President Biden has yet to settle on the outlines of an approach. What should the U.S. seek to achieve? Who are its partners?<br />As he mulls these questions, the president should take note of a July 16 conference, hosted by the government of Uzbekistan in Tashkent, on the subject of “regional connectivity.” The Uzbeks and their Central Asian neighbors, including Afghanistan, seek international diplomatic and economic support for new transport and infrastructure projects to connect their region with South and Southeast Asia.<br />A meeting for technocrats? The list of confirmed participants tells a different story. The foreign ministers of China, Russia, Iran, Turkey and India will attend, as well as the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan. These countries recognize that the issue of connectivity will determine the economic orientation of the rising powers of Central Asia, and even their self-determination and openness.<br />When Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan were still part of the Soviet Union, Moscow controlled their economies and diverted all their international trade and communications through Russia. The Soviet Union ended 30 years ago but elements of these deformations have endured. With the rise of Uzbekistan’s reforming President Shavkat Mirziyoyev five years ago and Kazakhstan’s concurrent effort to diversify and open its economy, barriers to trade began to fall.<br />Central Asian countries are reclaiming the ancient links among them that Russian colonialism sought to destroy. Thanks to America’s presence in Afghanistan, they could also reach out once more to Kabul as their sixth ancient partner. This quest is at once Central Asia’s key economic project, a bulwark of its cultural rebirth, and its move to secure self-determination in a neighborhood dominated by China, Russia and Iran.</td>

The assailants broke in, subdued Mr. Moïse’s guards and housekeeping staff, then shot the president 12 times—with one shot directly in his forehead, according to investigators. His eye had also been gouged out, the investigators said.<br />Neighbor Philogene Charles, 40 years old, said Mr. Moïse’s presence had given a sense of calm to the city’s Pelerin 5 district, where upscale mansions share a hillside with crowded slums. Suspicions and theories have flourished about the killing, including that it was an inside job and not a hit by foreign mercenaries, as the government officials have said.<br />“Nobody other than the president and his wife has a scratch on them. How can that be?” said Ms. Charles.<br />Haiti’s police chief, Leon Charles, has said that close to 30 foreign mercenaries were involved in the attack.

Vaccinations are the key: Covid-19 causes many more fatalities per infection than the flu, but vaccines significantly reduce people’s chances of catching the coronavirus and the seriousness of the disease if they do.<br />The virus will remain, however, a fact of life. “This is a virus that we’re going to have to learn to live with, and we’re going to have to learn to manage and we’re going to have Covid-19 patients for the foreseeable future,” said Edward A. Stenehjem, an infectious-disease specialist at Intermountain Healthcare in Murray, Utah, where cases resulting from the Delta variant have risen lately.<br />These highly vaccinated countries are the exceptions in a world where most have largely unvaccinated populations. Their authorities’ appetite for risk varies—even across jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada—but vaccinations are breaking a pattern seen earlier in the pandemic when rising case rates inevitably prompted tightening restrictions.</td>

      <td>Company announces the Marvel film also grossed more than $60 million on Disney+ platform</td>
      <td>Finally back in theaters, Hollywood’s dominant film franchise posted the biggest opening of the pandemic era as Marvel spinoff “Black Widow” ruled this weekend’s box office.<br />Walt Disney Co. ’s “Black Widow,” starring Scarlett Johansson in the titular role, grossed $80 million in the U.S. and Canada, according to preliminary studio estimates. The total bolsters hopes for a moviegoing rebound. For more than a year, the pandemic decimated the film industry as authorities closed businesses and public spaces to curb the spread of Covid-19.<br />The performance of “Black Widow” builds on the recent success of the latest “Fast & Furious” film, “F9: The Fast Saga,” which two weeks ago also set a highwater mark for a domestic box-office debut during the pandemic, by grossing $70 million in its opening weekend.  Comcast Corp.’s  Universal Pictures distributed the movie, which has made $141.3 in North America and $541.8 million globally.<br />The solid weekend of box-office grosses for “Black Widow” scored below average as far as Marvel debuts go. According to Box Office Mojo, when compared with all 24 Marvel Cinematic Universe titles dating back to 2008, the opening weekend of “Black Widow” ranks 19th, right behind “Doctor Strange,” which Disney released in 2016.<br />“Black Widow” is the first Marvel film Disney has released to theaters in more than two years. The last Marvel movie Disney sent to theaters, “Avengers: Endgame,” grossed nearly $2.8 billion world-wide, making for a brief time the highest-grossing film of all time.</td>

      <td>The companies censor on the government’s behalf. There’s ample precedent for calling it state action.</td>
      <td>The media has panned Donald Trump’s First Amendment lawsuits against Facebook,  Twitter  and YouTube: “sure to fail,” “as stupid as you’d think,” “ridiculous.” Mr. Trump’s complaint omits important precedents, facts and claims for relief, but there’s a strong case to be made that social-media censorship violates the Constitution. If his lawyers do better in court than in their initial filing, Mr. Trump can win.<br />It’s true that the First Amendment ordinarily applies to the government rather than private companies. But the central claim in Mr. Trump’s class-action lawsuit—that the defendants should be treated as state actors and are bound by the First Amendment when they engage in selective political censorship—has precedent to back it up. Their censorship constitutes state action because the government granted them immunity from legal liability, threatened to punish them if they allow disfavored speech, and colluded with them in choosing targets for censorship.<br />The Supreme Court held in Norwood v. Harrison (1973) that the government “may not induce, encourage, or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.” As Jed Rubenfeld and I argued in these pages in January, that’s what Congress did by passing Section 230(c)(2) of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which permits tech companies to censor constitutionally protected speech and immunizes them from state liability if they do so.<br />The high court has repeatedly held that federal immunity pre-empting state law can transform a private party’s conduct into state action subject to constitutional scrutiny. In Railway Employees’ Department v. Hanson (1956), the justices found state action in union-employer agreements because Congress had passed a statute immunizing such agreements from liability under state law. In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association (1989), the court again found state action in a private company’s conduct because federal laws immunized companies from liability if they tested employees for drugs.<br />Prominent congressional Democrats have also issued severe, explicit and repeated threats to retaliate against social-media giants if they fail to remove “hate speech” and “misinformation” that the government can’t directly censor under the Constitution. These threats have worked.</td>

      <td>Let’s see how it stands up against three measures of what makes a good IPO.</td>
      <td>Robinhood, the commission-free meme-stock dream shop, is going public. There’s talk of a bubbly $40 billion valuation. Woohoo! Plus, the company has announced that up to 35% of the new shares in the initial public offering are reserved for its own retail customers. Groundbreaking? I don’t know. If Robinhood really is the future of Wall Street, why not take itself public and sell 100% of the new shares to retail customers? Who needs  Goldman Sachs  and  JP Morgan ?<br />Back in my days as a Wall Street analyst, one of my favorite things to do was IPOs. I’d go on roadshows with management teams. My job was to provide earnings estimates since companies aren’t allowed to give forecasts, but really it was a branding exercise. I’d have my name associated with them, and maybe become “the ax in the stock”—the first person investors would call for insight.<br />But before that, you had to win the deal. Prospective banking teams would show up to do an IPO pitch, nicknamed the bake off, with thick pitchbooks some lowly bankers would pull all-nighters putting together. My job was to position the company to investors. Since there were tons of pitches and I was generally lazy, I used the same three bullet points every time: 1) The company sells into a monster market, 2) has an unfair competitive advantage, and 3) a business model to leverage that advantage. It worked almost every time. Sadly, that unfair stuff is now grounds for an antitrust investigation.<br />During the dot-com boom I ran a fund and my experience with IPOs meant I got calls most days from startup CEOs saying, “I hear you’re helpful picking bankers.” So I’d walk through pros and cons of bankers: reputation, research, retail vs. institutional, pricing, first-day stock pops (usually 10% to 20%, though sometimes it would double or even quintuple).<br />Remember, after an IPO, only 10% to 20% of total shares trade at first, until insider shares are unlocked some 180 days later, though sometimes earlier. Until then it’s not a real market—there is often more demand for shares than supply and IPO stock prices inflate. Perversely, that’s when most Robinhood customers will buy Robinhood shares and likely overpay. Steal from the (wannabe) rich, indeed.</td>

For additional luster, Djokovic could add a gold medal at the upcoming Summer Olympics in Tokyo, lifting that potential Grand Slam into a “Golden” One,  but on Sunday he indicated that the recent tightening of Covid-19 restrictions has him reconsidering his participation in the event.<br />“My plan was always to go to Olympic Games, but right now I’m a little bit divided,” Djokovic said.<br />It’d be an extraordinary accomplishment, either way. Djokovic would be the first men’s player to pull off a Grand Slam since Rod Laver, who first did it as an amateur in 1962, and then as a pro in 1969. Don Budge is the only other men’s player to win all four in a single year. Only Steffi Graf (1988) has managed a “Golden Slam.”</td>

      <td>WIMBLEDON, England—Novak Djokovic has spent his entire professional career chasing two men he was never supposed to catch.<br />For more than a decade, the battle for all-time men’s tennis supremacy seemed to be a race between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. They had taken head starts, winning Grand Slams while he was still a junior. Djokovic could only do his best to make up ground.<br />On Sunday, that chase came to an end. With his sixth Wimbledon championship, Novak Djokovic delivered a seismic moment in the history of men’s tennis and pulled level with Federer and Nadal on a men’s record 20 major titles. And with the 34-year-old poised to sweep up more as the most dominant player in the game, he is in the midst of rewriting tennis history every few months: it turns out that the Federer-Nadal era may have been mere prologue to the Djokovic dynasty.<br />By beating Matteo Berrettini of Italy, 6-7(4), 6-4, 6-4, 6-3, Djokovic also cleared another hurdle in his quest to complete a sweep of all four majors plus Olympic gold in a single calendar year, known as a Golden Slam. The world’s No. 1 player has now checked three of the five boxes, after also winning in Melbourne and Paris, and is on course to become the first player to pull it off since Steffi Graf in 1988. But Djokovic did cast some doubt over his trip to Tokyo after the match, citing concerns around Covid-19 case numbers in Japan.<br />“Right now I’m a little bit divided,” he said. “It’s kind of 50/50 because of what I heard in the last couple days.”</td>

      <td>Body of academic research shows U.S. economy has become less competitive as power swells in large firms, but not everyone agrees</td>
      <td>Behind President Biden’s executive order seeking to curb the power of companies that dominate their markets is a body of academic research that finds the U.S. economy has become less competitive in the past two decades as power swells in large firms.<br />The decline in competition has had big implications for the broader economy, this research finds, including fewer thriving startup companies, a less-dynamic job market, stagnant worker wages and restrained economywide productivity.<br />Democrats have responded by making boosting competition a key part of their agenda. Mr. Biden’s executive order encourages U.S. agencies to push back against corporate consolidation and business practices that might stifle competition across a range of industries, from Big Tech to airline baggage fees. Republicans and some conservative economists, meanwhile, point to studies casting skepticism on the degree of consolidation and showing benefits to consumers from big businesses, and they say government intervention risks making the U.S. economy less productive.<br />The research that finds market dominance by big firms suggests it goes beyond tech companies such as Google and  Amazon ,  to encompass hearing aids, banking, beer, mobile-phone services, airlines and others—and might also be related to government policies that allow firms to accumulate market share in their industries through acquisitions or favored treatment from regulators.<br />“Sixty or more years ago, most of us, including me, were altogether too willing to treat the economy as close to fully competitive. I now think that was a mistake,” Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow said in a recent interview. “The economy has grown less competitive and the elements of monopoly power are probably very important for the distribution of income between work and wealth and ultimately across individuals.”</td>

These factors weigh especially heavily on small businesses, which tend to have fewer resources to absorb price increases and less leverage either to negotiate lower rates or pass along the higher costs to customers.<br />Things aren’t expected to get better in the near term. Container ship operators say retailers started booking cargo space for year-end holiday merchandise in June, three months before the start of the traditional peak shipping season.<br />“We don’t see demand going down at all,” said Narin Phol, managing director for North America of Danish shipping giant  A.P.

      <td>Good news on credit and capital have propelled bank stocks this year, but that might run out of steam</td>
      <td>Banks have done a lot to put themselves in a position to benefit from higher rates. Now investors just have to wait.<br />Second-quarter earnings by the biggest banks in the country will start coming out Tuesday with reports from  JPMorgan Chase  and  Goldman Sachs ,  followed by more over the course of the week. The flow of news overall was good for banks in the second quarter. The results of the Federal Reserve’s stress test paved the way for big capital returns. Credit metrics continue to look very strong, as the slowing of stimulus hasn’t so far led to a surge in defaults. The Fed’s tweak to its overnight reverse repo rate helped relieve some pressure on banks’ bulging balance sheets.<br />Investors had been expecting much of this, driving the  up by nearly 40% at the start of June. The stocks have cooled a bit of late, but big banks have outperformed financials and the broader market overall. Nonetheless, big banks still trade at about 50% of the forward price-to-earnings multiple of the S&P 500, compared with a historical median of 75%, according to analysts at Autonomous Research. That implies some room to run.<br />But a big chunk of expected forward earnings are due to releases of loan-loss reserves, which are one-off profits that investors tend not to value very highly. So to narrow the gap, banks are probably going to need some even-better news. It might be tough to come by.<br />While there are some hopeful signs for core interest income, it is still not a great picture. Auto loans are hot, but they make up just 7% of big U.S. banks’ overall lending, according to Fed data, and are rather concentrated among a few lenders. Big U.S. banks’ cash piles that drag on asset yields have shrunk since May, but as a percentage of assets they are still about twice as high as they were at the start of the pandemic, Fed data show. Interest rates aren’t helping much either: Despite the uptick in some short-term rates, longer-term yields remain stubbornly low, with those of 10-year Treasury notes recently dipping back to February levels.</td>

They forecast the annual rise to recede to slightly less than 2.3% a year in 2022 and 2023.<br />That would mean an average annual increase of 2.58% from 2021 through 2023, putting inflation at levels last seen in 1993.<br />“We’re in a transitional phase right now,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics LLC. “We are transitioning to a higher period of inflation and interest rates than we’ve had over the last 20 years.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A complex international corporate tax deal that took years to hammer out soon faces one of its toughest tests: the U.S. Congress.<br />The Group of 20 major economies backed the plan this weekend in Venice, Italy, following the earlier endorsement from a broader 130-country group. The plan, aimed at limiting corporate tax avoidance, would revamp longstanding international rules and is crucial to President Biden’s plans to raise corporate taxes.<br />“The world is ready to end the global race to the bottom on corporate taxation, and there’s broad consensus about how to do it,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.<br />As detailed negotiations continue, other countries will look to see if U.S. lawmakers implement a minimum corporate tax of at least 15% and embrace new rules for dividing the power to tax the largest companies. Congress will stare back, monitoring how quickly other countries create minimum taxes and remove unilateral taxes on digital companies that have drawn bipartisan U.S. opposition.<br />“The rest of the world is very aware that the administration cannot bind Congress,” said Chip Harter, the Trump administration’s lead international tax negotiator, who is now at PwC LLP. “They are watching very closely.”</td>

Senior year of high school, I needed to take an AP class, and I was going to do AP art. He was like, “Try computer science.”<br />I had never touched computer programming before, and I fell in love with it. It’s very satisfying. You make a change, you see the output. Because of my positive experience in that class, I decided to major in it.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats are racing to finalize a bipartisan infrastructure deal and set the contours of a broad child-care and education plan, aiming to maintain a delicate agreement with Republicans while simultaneously plowing forward with their own priorities.<br />After a two-week recess, senators return to Washington this week to determine the fate of much of President Biden’s roughly $4 trillion agenda. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told Senate Democrats in a letter on Friday that he expects that the chamber will take up both a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure agreement and a resolution setting the parameters of a bill encompassing other Democratic priorities in the coming weeks.<br />While staff have been filling in details of the infrastructure agreement, Democrats remain divided over the size and scope of the other, broader bill. Liberals such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) have called for as much as $6 trillion in spending in the package, while moderates have favored a smaller number.<br />Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee are seeking to reach an agreement on the top-line cost of the package soon and bring a budget resolution to the Senate floor in the coming weeks, the first step before other committees will craft the details of the legislation.<br />Adding to the sensitivity of the negotiations, many lawmakers have linked the fate of the two efforts. Some Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) have said they won’t support the infrastructure agreement unless the other legislation moves forward, while some Republicans have said advancing other Democratic priorities could cause them to oppose the infrastructure deal.</td>

      <td>In 2016, Elon Musk had two unprofitable businesses on his hands in Tesla  and SolarCity Corp. His solution to improve their outlook: combine them into a single clean-energy business.<br />Five years later, Mr. Musk is being called to defend the propriety of that roughly $2.1 billion tie-up in a Delaware court. Plaintiffs, which include several pension funds that owned Tesla stock, have characterized the deal as a scheme to benefit himself and bail out a home-solar company on the verge of insolvency.<br />Mr. Musk, who is expected to take the stand in the nonjury trial as early as Monday, was chairman of both companies at the time. His attorneys have framed the acquisition as an opportunity to realize his long-held goal of creating a vertically integrated sustainable energy company.<br />A primary question in the case is whether Mr. Musk, who owned roughly 22% of Tesla at the time, controlled the transaction. Proving that claim is a challenge because Mr. Musk was a minority shareholder of Tesla and the company’s shareholders approved the acquisition. Lawyers for Mr. Musk say that SolarCity was worth more than Tesla paid for it and the electric vehicle-maker’s board members, who included Mr. Musk’s brother, Kimbal Musk, acted independently.<br />Other issues before the judge include whether Tesla board members were conflicted and whether vital information about the deal was withheld from shareholders.</td>

It was undertaken for the survival of the animals, surrounding communities and a multibillion-dollar fishing industry that stretches from Oregon to Alaska.<br />“We don’t want to move fish unless it becomes absolutely necessary,” Mr. Turik said.

Portland hit 116 degrees, Seattle was 108 degrees, and the Canadian village of Lytton, B.C., reached a high of 121.<br />As of Friday, officials in Oregon and Washington said at least 194 died in the recent heat wave.

      <td>Discount chain bets it can manage rising wages and shipping rates by tinkering with selection and trimming costs</td>
      <td>Dollar Tree Inc.  is famous for selling most of its products—from a pair of flip flops to a small bottle of detergent—for a dollar apiece.<br />The strategy, which draws in loyal shoppers looking for bargains, has left the discount chain with less room than rivals to manage rising costs this year. The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed up transportation rates, workers’ wages and prices for some raw materials.<br />“We are still going to deliver at a dollar as our customers have expected for over 30 years,” said Michael Witynski, a grocery veteran who joined Dollar Tree in 2010 and took over as its chief executive a year ago. The challenge, he said in a recent interview, is to continue to find ways to buy products such as holiday decorations, snacks and craft supplies for around 43 cents, then charge $1 to shoppers.<br />Prices are rising for a range of goods and services as shipping and manufacturing remain snarled by the pandemic and other factors. At the same time, demand for many products is high while U.S. consumers continue to emerge from last year’s lockdowns. In many cases, consumer-goods companies such as  Procter & Gamble Co.  and  General Mills Inc.  are passing those price increases onto consumers. For a chain that attracts shoppers with mostly $1 products, adapting can be more challenging.<br />The majority of Dollar Tree’s products are store brands, which gives it flexibility in an inflationary environment. Last year Dollar Tree changed the packaging on a bestselling over-the-door metal hanger, Mr. Witynski said, moving to a smaller, less-expensive cardboard hook for shelf display. The retailer started shipping $1 gift bags, another big seller, in boxes of 72, up from 24 to save on shipping costs, he said. Cartons of fresh eggs fluctuate between 18, 12 or 6 packs, depending on costs.</td>

      <td>WIMBLEDON, England—After spending nearly a year back home in Australia, Ashleigh Barty packed her bags in March and flew to Europe with the sole objective of winning more Grand Slam tournaments.<br />On Saturday, after four straight months on the road, the world’s No. 1 women’s tennis player picked up what she came for. With a dominant performance, Barty blew away Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic, 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-3, to add her first Wimbledon title to the French Open she won in 2019.<br />Barty, 25, also became the first Wimbledon women’s singles champion from Australia since her mentor Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. Barty teared up on court at the mere mention of her after the match.<br />Pliskova, a former world No. 1 herself, found it impossible to hide her nerves as she chased a first major title. On the browning grass of Centre Court, she simply froze. Pliskova lost the first 14 points of the match and found herself down by a set in just 28 minutes. When she finally took a point, the capacity crowd in the stadium met her with a huge round of applause.<br />Pliskova settled into the match in the second set, dialing into the power that defines her game, full of booming serves and heavy groundstrokes. Barty, meanwhile, kept up her mixture of clean topspin and clever slices that skimmed low off the grass to force the 6-foot-1 Pliskova all over the court.</td>

      <td>Two years ago, in the waiting room of my doctor’s office in New York City, I froze. In my hands was a patient intake form asking for my personal information, with a blank I didn’t know how to fill: “emergency contact.”<br />I thought about the guy I had just started going out with—we’d been hanging out every week for the last three months and things seemed to be going well. But we hadn’t had the talk about what we were doing or who we were to each other. Was it too soon? Emergency contact seemed like a huge step.<br />When I moved to the U.S. by myself at the age of 18, I didn’t expect my emergency contact to be one of the hardest questions I would face. I grew up in Shanghai as an only child under China’s one-child policy. My parents, who grew up in small villages in Jiangsu province, worked hard to put down roots in a big city where they had no family or connections. Grandparents and relatives would visit, but we were mostly on our own. Chinese healthcare forms generally didn’t ask for an emergency contact.<br />Going to college in the U.S. was my idea. Somehow I wasn’t scared by the thought of going to a foreign country where I had no family or friends and which I had only visited once before, for two weeks. Even in high school, I dreamed of becoming a reporter and going to Columbia University’s journalism school. My parents weren’t affluent, but they did everything they could to help me realize my dreams.<br />I had to put down an emergency contact for the first time when I enrolled in college in Boston. I simply put down my mother’s name and contact information in China without thinking much about it. There were far more important problems to solve: how to speak English all the time, how to survive the beautiful but often brutal New England winters, how to make new friends, how to find a part-time job on a student visa, even what to eat at the dining hall.</td>

The Trump administration ordered hospitals to make their prices public starting Jan. 1, but many hospitals have failed to comply.<br />The recommendations come after the federal government has already stepped up its review of healthcare competition and pricing practices.<br />Last December, the FTC sued to stop Hackensack Meridian Health’s agreement to acquire Englewood Healthcare Foundation. Hackensack Meridian is fighting the FTC suit, said a spokesman, who declined to comment further.</td>

Maplelane Capital is down 39% for the period. Some other funds that sustained lesser losses in the January meme-stock surge are doing better. Steven A. Cohen’s $22 billion Point72 Asset Management and the $20 billion D1 Capital Partners are up about 1% and 3.8% for the first half of the year, respectively, said people familiar with the funds’ performance.<br />Still, those returns trail the broader market as the S&P 500 was up 15.3% over that period, including dividends.<br />The January market maelstrom that enveloped a small but prominent group of funds was as shocking as it was fast. At the time, an army of bullish individual traders urged one another on platforms like Reddit to pile into stocks and, at times, band together to intensify losses among professional traders betting against those so-called meme stocks. Money managers protested that social-media hordes were manipulating stock prices.<br />The rally dealt big losses to star Wall Street investors, made folk heroes of some individual investors, sparked a congressional hearing and drew scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We’re unprepared for the assault of someone spewing false information right to our face. But detecting B.S.—shorthand for a coarser version of what my grandmother called hogwash—is a crucial skill, also known as critical thinking, as we head back out into the world.<br />John Petrocelli is a social psychologist and professor of psychology at Wake Forest University, in Winston-Salem, N.C. He researches the causes and consequences of B.S., to help us improve our ability to detect and dispose of it. His studies have found that people tend to spread B.S. when they feel obligated to have an opinion about something they know little about—and when they feel they aren’t going to be challenged on it. He has a new book coming out later this month, called “The Life-Changing Science of Detecting Bullshit.”<br />Dr. Petrocelli says that some B.S.—such as flattery or an opinion about something inconsequential, like a TV show—serves a purpose: It connects us. But B.S. can often be dangerous, such as when people spread false rumors about a person; repeat information about current events that is not based on truth; or sugarcoat facts in a way that leads us to make a poor decision. “Imagine if you were looking to buy a home and the people who lived there told you it was a great place to live, but it really wasn’t,” he says.<br />I spoke with Dr. Petrocelli about who spreads B.S., when we’re susceptible to it, and how we can confront it.

Though 10 years behind the company’s schedule, a successful flight by Mr. Branson as a “mission specialist” on board his  Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.  spacecraft would provide a lift to the nascent tourism business.</td>

      <td>Google has adopted rules similar to ones that  Apple Inc.  requires for its software that powers smartphones and distributes apps to them. That is getting it into trouble.<br />The antitrust case brought against Google Wednesday by attorneys general from 36 states and the District of Columbia says the  Alphabet Inc.  unit’s Android mobile operating system and its app marketplace—the Play Store—have increasingly evolved to become a so-called walled garden. That is a phrase commonly applied to Apple and how the iPhone maker pushes consumers to remain within its ecosystem of hardware, software and services.<br />Google pitched Android at its outset more than a decade ago as the “first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices.” Unlike Apple, Google licenses Android and its proprietary apps such as the Play Store to mobile device makers. Competing app stores can also be developed on the Android platform.<br />Those factors helped boost the use of Android, which is active on more than three billion devices world-wide and, according to Statcounter, to the most popular operating system in terms of internet usage.<br />In their 144-page complaint, the attorneys general accused Google of working to diminish competition in Android app distribution and wrest increasing amounts of money from developers.</td>

      <td>As the world’s largest economies seal an ambitious tax deal, other common problems such as climate change demand more difficult compromises</td>
      <td>VENICE—Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 leading economies on Saturday endorsed an overhaul of the rules for taxing international companies, a landmark achievement of global cooperation after years of tensions.<br />G-20 members have rarely been able to agree to such ambitious changes over the past decade of disputes over trade, investment and jobs, although they did work together to offset the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The tax agreement, negotiated earlier this month by 130 countries, has raised hopes that major economies can find common approaches to tackling other global problems, such as climate change and trade.<br />But raising taxes to pay for the mounting cost of tackling the Covid-19 pandemic is relatively straightforward for governments that all stand to gain to different degrees, whereas tackling climate change requires more fundamental economic changes and arguments over which countries should bear how much of the burden.<br />The tax overhaul breaks new ground in two ways. It is the first time that governments have set a floor for the tax rate faced by big international companies. G-20 governments have also overturned a longstanding principle under which profits are taxed where businesses have a physical presence—known as a permanent establishment—rather than where their sales are made.<br />“These past six weeks have really been momentous for economic diplomacy,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “We’re seeing a revival of multilateralism on a whole host of issues.”</td>

      <td>An engrossing retrospective at Mass MoCA surveys the career of the pioneering environmental artist whose installations play with our perceptions of space and form.</td>
      <td>North Adams, Mass.<br />James Turrell (b. 1943) is to Light & Space art what Picasso was to Cubism. His 1966 projections of intense light into corners of walls to create glowing, floating illusions of cubes were the “Desmoiselles d’Avignon” of the style. That’s an inexact parallel, for Robert Irwin—15 years Mr. Turrell’s senior, also a Southern California artist and, like him, a recipient of one of the first MacArthur Foundation grants given to artists—was the other pioneering Light & Space artist. Yet Mr. Turrell’s global reach (he has completed major projects in Spain and China), not to mention his continuing—and gargantuan—Roden Crater project in the Arizona desert, put him in a class by himself.<br />“James Turrell: Into the Light,” on the vast campus of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art—known simply as Mass MoCA—with at least one piece from each decade of the artist’s career, which begain in 1966, is a kind of retrospective and, for those not familiar with his work, a primer.<br />That the artist is the son of an aeronautical engineer father and a Quaker mother are important in understanding his work. He’s an experienced pilot who sees the Earth and sky differently from most of us: in a word, phenomenologically. He’s also a former “lapsed Quaker” who now describes himself as a “relapsed Quaker” with a belief in Quakerism’s “inner light” and the idea that God is manifest in every one of us. (This partly explains the exhibition title.) With Mr. Turrell, these are no airy-fairy beliefs, but rather the underpinnings of a quiet ferocity permeating everything he does. (A half-century ago, I played in a couple of pickup basketball games with Mr. Turrell, who was a varsity athlete at his small college. He was in another zone on the court, fiercely unkind to my mediocre opposition.)<br />All of Mr. Turrell’s works are somehow at once typical and sui generis. In “Perfectly Clear (Ganzfeld)” (1991), one ascends (after donning blue paper booties to protect the floor) black-carpeted steps to enter a large, bright white chamber whose floor rises almost imperceptibly toward the back wall—which is less like a wall than an entry into some kind of deep space. That back wall slowly changes colors, as does the light in the entire chamber. For painters, there’s a Rothko-gone-to-heaven feel. Immediately in front of that changing color-field wall is an invisible drop in the floor; a sensor that sets off an alarm prevents injury to viewers who get too close to it. In “Hind sight” (1984), another room, everything is pitch black, a beyond-black that gives you a frightening (or peaceful, depending on your mindset) hint of what the second term in Jean-Paul Sartre’s “Being and Nothingness” is all about. Viewers use railings to find their way in the dark to seats, where they may sit for 15 minutes before being called out by the guard.</td>

      <td>LONDON—While 60,000 fans inside Wembley Stadium steeled themselves for a penalty shootout last week, Italy captain Giorgio Chiellini seemed to be the only person unaware that this was a tense moment.<br />After 120 minutes of action against Spain in the European Championship semifinal, Chiellini approached the coin toss and started joking around. He laughed with the referee and teased his opposite number, Jordi Alba. But as anyone who has ever witnessed the spectacle of Italy in a major-tournament semifinal knows, Italian soccer is supposed to be melodrama, not comedy.<br />The difference this year is that Italy entered Euro 2020 with a drastic new approach. The team that was never among the favorites came here first and foremost to entertain. And if Italy is hard to recognize compared to previous, more successful iterations of the team, the country can have no complaints.<br />The fun, revamped Azzurri have a chance to become European champions in Sunday’s final against England. This opera buffa even has a catchphrase. Subverting the English rallying cry of “It’s coming home,” Italian fans promise that this week, “It’s coming Rome.”<br />“I thank the players, because they believed right from day one that we could produce something incredible,” Italy manager Roberto Mancini said. “Almost no one believed we could do it, and yet we’re into the final.”</td>

      <td>Banks say the wealthy are borrowing more than ever, using low-interest loans backed by their investments</td>
      <td>Rising stocks and rock-bottom interest rates have delivered a big perk to rich Americans: cheap loans that they can use to fund their lifestyles while minimizing their tax bills.<br />Banks say their wealthy clients are borrowing more than ever before, often using loans backed by their portfolios of stocks and bonds.  Morgan Stanley  wealth-management clients have $68.1 billion worth of securities-based and other nonmortgage loans outstanding, more than double five years earlier.  Bank of America Corp.  said it has $62.4 billion in securities-based loans, dwarfing its book of home-equity lines of credit.<br />The loans have special benefits beyond the flexible repayment terms and low interest rates on offer. They allow borrowers who need cash to avoid selling in a hot market. Startup founders can monetize their stakes without losing control of their companies. The super rich often use these loans as part of a “buy, borrow, die” strategy to avoid capital-gains taxes.<br />The merely rich are also borrowing against their portfolios. When Tom Anderson started at Merrill Lynch & Co. in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 2002, many of his fellow advisers had just one or two securities-based loans in their book of business. Over the years, he encouraged more clients to borrow and noticed peers doing the same. Now it is common for advisers at big firms to have dozens of these loans outstanding, he said. Merrill Lynch is now a part of Bank of America.<br />“You could buy a boat, you could go to Disney World, you could buy a company,” said Mr. Anderson, who now consults with banks on how to manage the risks associated with these loans. “The tax benefits are stunning.”</td>

      <td>The pandemic changed makeup of staffs at companies from Costco to American Airlines, leading to big swings in median pay</td>
      <td>Employees of  Costco Wholesale Corp.  and  Home Depot Inc.  saw demand for their services swell last year as homebound Americans stocked up on food and remodeled their homes. But Costco’s median worker made 16% less in 2020 than in the previous year while Home Depot’s made 21% more.<br />The divergence doesn’t mean one chain paid better than the other. It reflects how the pandemic and companies’ varied responses to it fundamentally altered the makeup of their workforces, fueling sometimes counterintuitive swings in median employee pay. (See what the median worker was paid at S&P 500 companies.)<br />Home Depot instituted a range of temporary pay increases to reward existing workers, lifting its pay structure. So did Costco, but that move was more than offset by a flood of new hires brought in to meet demand, tilting the balance of its workforce toward lower earners.<br />Median pay moved in opposite directions at some close competitors as well, again with changes in the compositions of their workforces. At  American Airlines Group Inc.  and  Southwest Airlines Co. , thousands of employees were furloughed, took unpaid time off or left the companies as air travel stalled. Median pay rose 20% at one and fell nearly 35% at the other. Much the same happened at the big cruise lines: Two reported median pay more than 50% above 2019 levels—a third reported a 50% drop.<br />Complex rules for reporting median employee pay also contributed.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s sweeping new competition order targets big tech companies in ways that could fundamentally alter how they do business.<br />But it will fall to government agencies to carry out the order, and they could take years to put its ideas into action. The Federal Trade Commission that already has Big Tech companies in its sights is likely to become a particular battleground.<br />A core thrust of the order is to encourage regulatory agencies such as the FTC to adopt new rules and policies to rein in the growing size and power of large tech platforms such as  Amazon.com Inc.,   Alphabet Inc.’s   Google  and  Facebook Inc.  That could prove to be a tall order for the FTC, the principal federal regulator of internet commerce. Some observers say the agency—which had its sails trimmed by Congress in the deregulatory era of the 1970s and 1980s—has struggled to keep up with unfair practices online, particularly in the areas of user privacy, big data and tech mergers.<br />As the White House detailed its executive order, one Democratic FTC commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, said in a tweet, “So excited about @POTUS’s EO on competition; it is an ambitious agenda that will help our markets work better and create a more equitable economy for all people - esp workers, marginalized communities, entrepreneurs, small biz.”<br />Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association that counts  Apple Inc.,  Facebook and Google among its members, defended the tech industry as competitive and vibrant and took issue with the White House’s action.</td>

Recent data from Israel, though, showed the Pfizer vaccine is less effective at protecting against infection from the Delta variant when compared with previous strains, posing a challenge for health authorities as many countries ease coronavirus restrictions as vaccination programs progress.</td>

      <td>China’s internet regulator moved Saturday toward requiring data-rich tech companies to undergo cybersecurity reviews ahead of any foreign listings, making explicit for the first time a data-security requirement that marred last week’s U.S. initial public offering by Didi Global Inc.<br />Separately, China’s main antitrust regulator on Saturday blocked  Tencent Holding Ltd. ’s bid to combine the country’s two biggest game-streaming platforms, its first public intervention to halt a merger in China’s technology sector.<br />The moves come at the end of a week that was marked by a flurry of actions by Beijing aimed at reining in the nation’s tech giants. The two moves are the clearest signals yet that authorities are tightening the leash on overseas-listed Chinese companies amid concerns about data security. It also shows that regulators are rethinking the bigger-is-better mentality that allowed homegrown companies like Tencent and  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  to become global players.<br />The security review revision, released Saturday by the Cyberspace Administration of China for public comment, said companies holding personal data on at least one million users must apply for a cybersecurity review. Previously, companies seeking overseas stock listings weren’t explicitly obligated to conduct such reviews, though they would typically do so if asked by officials.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Didi, the Chinese ride-hailing firm, pushed ahead with its $4.4 billion New York IPO late last month despite being urged by China’s internet regulator to submit itself to a cybersecurity review.</td>

In New York, Didi offered assurances that Beijing had given it the green light, said people close to the listing process.<br />Unaware of the impending threat from Beijing, these people said, Didi’s bankers pushed the deal forward. On June 30, the world’s largest ride-hailing platform began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. On the second day of trading, Didi’s shares rose 16%, valuing the company at about $80 billion.<br />But the fanfare was short-lived. Beijing, taken by surprise by the IPO, struck back on July 2. It put Didi under cybersecurity review and banned it from accepting new users. Over the next few days, it told app stores to stop offering Didi’s app, and announced it was tightening rules for Chinese companies listed or looking to list overseas.<br />Didi now faces a double whammy: regulatory action at home and blowback from U.S. and global investors who wonder how the company could have gone ahead with a listing while under a regulatory cloud. Didi’s shares are now 14% below their IPO price.</td>

      <td>President Biden has modeled his spending agenda on the Great Society and New Deal. Now he wants to take antitrust policy back to the early 20th century. Or at least that’s how it looks from his executive order on Friday to regulate competition and impose more government control over the private economy.<br />“In the early 1900s, Teddy Roosevelt’s Administration broke up the trusts controlling the economy—Standard Oil,  J.P. Morgan ’s  railroads, and others—giving the little guy a fighting chance,” his summary states. Mr. Biden now wants to use regulation to break up Big Tech, finance, agriculture and healthcare companies, among others.<br />At least two parts of his order are encouraging. He directs Health and Human Services to let hearing aids be sold over the counter, which would offset federal rules that make the devices more expensive than necessary. He also encourages the Federal Trade Commission to ban unnecessary occupational licensing, which is long overdue. These are the government barriers to entry that stymie entrepreneurs, often minorities, in services like hair-braiding or plumbing.<br />These are deregulatory actions, but the rest of his order is about enhancing government power. Courts for more than a century have applied antitrust law based on the “rule of reason.” Scholars and judges across the political spectrum, including Phillip Areeda and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, have shifted antitrust focus from market concentration to economic analysis and consumer welfare.<br />The new Brandeisians in the Biden Administration led by the National Economic Council’s Tim Wu (godfather of net neutrality) and FTC chair Lina Khan want to replace the rule of reason with the rule of politics. Mr. Biden’s order includes 72 directives that mostly aim to shackle businesses.</td>

      <td>You won’t believe what the White House thinks is an ethical solution.</td>
      <td>As President Biden’s son Hunter prepares for an art exhibition this fall that could include selling his paintings at prices up to $500,000, the White House is reportedly working with his attorney on a strategy to avoid ethical compromises. Here it is: Keep everything secret. Yes, for real, that’s the plan.<br />The New York gallery hosting the sale, media reports say, will refuse “suspicious” offers, including those over list price. The names of the buyers and bidders will be kept confidential, even from Hunter. As the paintings sell, apparently hundreds of thousands of dollars will simply appear in his bank account, and neither he nor the public will know where it came from.<br />You don’t feel reassured? Sources in the art world say the prices being floated—from $75,000 to $500,000, depending on the piece—are seriously high, especially for an unknown painter doing a first sale. So the question is who might be quietly trying to funnel money to President Biden’s son.<br />The art sale is a bad idea, full stop. But at least transparency would let bids be scrutinized in real time, preferably before a sale is final. Instead the White House is proposing opacity, even as its press aides brag that President Biden “has established the highest ethical standards of any administration in American history.”<br />Would the promised confidentiality be kept? Whispers about who bought what are inevitable. A Russian oligarch could have a proxy purchase a $500,000 painting for the purpose of leaking the information to hurt President Biden’s credibility. Why take this risk?</td>

      <td>A Japanese official tells the truth about China’s Taiwan ambitions.</td>
      <td>Japan’s government played clean-up this week after Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso indicated the country would intervene to repel a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Such Chinese military expansion, he said Monday, could threaten Japan’s “survival,” and “if that is the case, Japan and the U.S. must defend Taiwan together.”<br />Japan officially embraces a “one-China” policy and favors a diplomatic resolution between Beijing and Taipei. China’s state media on Wednesday published a piece in response warning that if Japan is involved in a conflict over Taiwan, it “will become the target of China’s military strike. This will endanger Japan’s survival.”<br />While others in Tokyo said Mr. Aso’s comments were his personal view, in consensus-oriented Japan this is almost never true. Mr. Aso, who was also Prime Minister for a year in the late 2000s, is reflecting a growing chunk of Japanese opinion on the political center-right.<br />His gaffe is that he blurted out (at a political fundraiser) the truth that a Chinese takeover of Taiwan would blow up the half-century-old security order in Asia and pose a direct military threat to Japan, whose southernmost islands are adjacent to Taiwan. “Okinawa could be the next,” he added, according to press reports.<br />The subjugation of Taiwan, despite U.S. support and military aid, would undermine if not end the credibility of the U.S. security pact with Japan, which helps maintain the country’s independence. In the balance of power between the world’s two largest economies, the U.S. and China, the world’s third-largest economy, Japan, is critical.</td>

      <td>The problem isn’t Hunter Biden—it’s Joe—as major media outlets may be discovering, sort of, with the White House’s absurd intervention in the younger Mr. Biden’s latest career as a budding Van Gogh.<br />In fact, the intervention smells like a scheme dreamed up by Hunter himself, designed to call attention to his connection to the president, advertise it and enable it, while pretending to do the opposite.<br />For details, see a long account on the front page of Friday’s Washington Post. Under the plan, a New York gallery will keep secret the identities of those paying up to $500,000 for his novice pieces, but of course this wouldn’t stop the buyer from letting Hunter know who just bought his art or from turning up later as Hunter’s guest at a White House event.<br />All of this is magnificently obvious on its own terms, but even more so in light of the ludicrously detailed, well-documented revelations from the Hunter Biden laptop published over the last nine months by the New York Post and Britain’s Daily Mail.<br />To avoid knowing the truth so you don’t have to report it is not good reporting. This has been the approach of other media, or was until last month when the Washington Post’s resident “fact checker,” Glenn Kessler, in a hilariously neurotic piece, apparently forced on him only because of his previous swallowing of Biden denials, finally confirmed some of the New York Post’s reporting.</td>

Later that afternoon the camp, run by the Sidwell Friends School, called to complain about her mask compliance.<br />We’re now 16 months into the pandemic and children remain victims of the Covid political theater that has characterized the national debate about masks ever since.<br />We’ve had an entire school year to prove what scientists have said all along: Children aren’t major vectors of the virus, and schools and child-care centers aren’t drivers of community spread. Consider three of my children and their two schools. One went to class in person all year unmasked; the other two were required to wear masks, even at recess. Both schools had the same number of Covid cases: zero.<br />Multiple peer-reviewed studies have found that children transmit the virus at a much lower rate than adults do. The latest comprehensive data show that children have an extremely low chance of dying or becoming seriously ill from Covid-19, and that the child mortality rate is much lower than what public-health officials had initially suspected.</td>

Here’s what we know so far.<br />Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford University at 19 years old to start the company that became Theranos, a startup that promised to revolutionize the blood-testing industry. After operating largely in secret for a decade, Theranos began in 2013 touting its technology, which it said could test for dozens of health conditions with a few drops of blood extracted from a finger prick, eliminating the need for large needles and vials of blood.<br />The company said it wanted to make blood testing more user-friendly and offered tests at rates that were lower than competitors.<br />Theranos announced a partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. in September 2013 that put Theranos centers in Arizona and California pharmacies, and had signed a major deal with the Safeway Inc. grocery store chain. The company’s valuation eventually reached $9 billion.<br />The Wall Street Journal began reporting on questions about Theranos in 2015, revealing that only a few tests could be performed on its proprietary technology and that most were being run on traditional machines, including some that Theranos altered to work with diluted finger-prick samples.</td>

      <td>From the beginning, the purpose of the Masterpiece column has been to highlight artworks of surpassing cultural significance and discuss the particular qualities that make them so. How, then, to explain the intrusion into this august company of a utilitarian object, in this case a biface, or hand axe, dated 700,000-200,000 B.C.?<br />Behind the creative impulse is the aesthetic sense, the desire to make something beautiful, or at least pleasing to the eye. For almost all of human history, utilitarian objects, by contrast, were all about practicality, crafting something that can get the job done. Never the twain shall meet.<br />Two factors, though, suggest that here the dividing line might not be crystal clear. The first is the biface’s location, not in a natural history museum where they are usually to be found, but the Metropolitan Museum, a repository of art.<br />The second is its label. “This is one of the largest and most finely crafted bifaces found in France,” we are told. “Its size and the care with which it was made raise the question of whether it was meant to be a tool, or if it was chiefly valued for its appearance and reserved for a different use.”<br />Could we, then, be looking at one of the earliest glimmerings of the aesthetic sense, an object whose appearance was driven by an ambition more exalted than pure utility? We cannot know for sure, of course, but the visual evidence strongly suggests that we are.</td>

That in turn has helped yields fall even further.<br />On Friday, yields rose early in the session and then continued higher in choppy trading, snapping a four-session streak of declines. Some analysts and investors said that the market was due for a pause after sharp drops in recent sessions and expect that yields will continue to rebound as the economy recovers.</td>

But that same idea has been on the government’s table for more than a decade and made little progress.<br />President Biden’s office on Friday said it “encourages the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to issue rules allowing customers to download their banking data and take it with them” from bank to bank. That directive was part of a broader executive order aimed at promoting competition in a number of industries.<br />The CFPB already was given the authority to write such rules in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. One brief portion, Section 1033, established that banks and other financial firms should make available to customers data on their transactions, charges and other account details. Dodd-Frank also said that the data should be made available “in an electronic form usable by consumers.”<br />That kind of data had long been siloed at individual banks. By making it more shareable, consumers could gain the ability to better keep track of their spending and compare costs of credit cards and other financial products. But the CFPB has been slow to implement that part of the legislation, even when top officials were supportive of the section’s goals.<br />In 2016, then-director of the CFPB Richard Cordraydelivered a speech endorsing consumer access to their own financial information and the ability for people to give permission to third parties to access that information on their behalf. A year later, the CFPB put out a set of guiding principles on the matter, but it wasn’t until October 2020 that the agency initiated a rule-making process on the subject of consumer-data access.</td>

But in May, AlixPartners revised its projection upward to $110 billion.<br />The firm said that overall auto makers are expected to sell about 80.7 million new cars this year, down from an earlier estimate of 84.6 million—a loss of about 3.9 million unit sales world-wide as a result of the chip shortage.</td>

What the Biden Executive Order Could Mean For Your Health, Job and Money</a></td>
      <td>President Biden outlined an executive order that takes aim at a laundry list of consumer complaints</td>
      <td>Help on baggage fees? Cheaper prescription drugs? The right to fix your iPhone yourself? President Biden on Friday outlined an executive order that reads like a laundry list of consumer wishes. It’s intended to help give people more choices, lower prices and higher wages by seeking changes on a range of fronts, from jobs and healthcare to travel and technology.<br />The announcement won’t likely change much for consumers immediately—the order by itself doesn’t impose new requirements on businesses. Instead, it encourages government agencies to adopt policies and write regulations that push back against corporate consolidation and business practices that may stifle competition, lead to higher prices and lead to fewer product choices.<br />Here’s a guide to what the order could mean for your money, job and health.<br />The order directs the Transportation Department to consider rules requiring fee refunds when your bags are delayed, and for fees to be clearly disclosed.<br />The baggage-fee refund issue has been pending before the department for years. The Obama administration put through a rule saying airlines had to refund baggage fees if luggage was lost by the airline in transit, but declined to require refunds for bags that were late. In 2016, Congress told the DOT to adopt the idea, but it never went forward. Congress also said airlines should be required to refund other fees, like Wi-Fi or in-flight entertainment, if those services don’t work.</td>

      <td>Investment giant’s moves set off flow of more than $1 billion to one relatively small ETF in just days</td>
      <td>In late May, an obscure  BlackRock Inc.  commodities fund took in more than $1 billion in new money in less than a week.<br />The iShares GSCI Commodity Dynamic Roll Strategy exchange-traded fund was a relatively small fund in BlackRock’s larger suite of funds. But on the week of May 26, the ETF—which trades under the ticker COMT and tracks futures contracts tied to commodities from energy to metals to agriculture—scored its biggest one-day influx of new cash on record, according to FactSet data.<br />The surge helped the ETF more than double its assets under management to more than $2 billion.<br />The answer for why so much money flowed into the fund wasn’t solely because Wall Street traders were up in arms with inflation fears that were helping to drive idle funds into commodity investments. According to BlackRock documents and people familiar with the matter, BlackRock had sent instructions to brokerages and other financial platforms to alter a series of “model portfolios” to include this fund.<br />Model portfolios are ready-made fund combos delivered through financial advisers and brokerages to everyday investors. Brokerages can design their own model portfolios, or rely on guidance from fund companies like BlackRock. The May surge in the BlackRock fund shows just how powerful that guidance can be.</td>

She says it with a smirk as she walks out the door on her way to the farm where she grows organic vegetables for a living.<br />I also love vegetables, and I love meat, and I would still be eating a lot more of the latter than I do now if I hadn’t started cutting it with vegetables from the farm.<br />These days, vegetables are on-trend. Manhattan’s three-Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park has become a vegan restaurant, and the culinary website Epicurious has dropped beef recipes entirely going forward—which is, in a lot of ways, too bad. My wife will tell you organic vegetable farming is not possible without animal inputs. It is important that those animals are well stewarded and properly treated, and there are many small farms that are doing things correctly.<br />Raising meat animals the right way does cost more. Those costs are passed along to the consumer; using less meat per serving is a way to continue to support small farms and a way to stretch more expensive meat. In our house, that’s a win-win.<br />Most days I keep meat down to an ounce or less per serving and fill the recipes out with vegetables. Our Sloppy Joes are mostly carrots and beets with a little meat to keep the flavor and the protein levels high enough to satisfy my meat cravings.</td>

Unvaccinated adults and children under 12, for whom vaccines haven’t yet been authorized in the U.S., should wear masks and students of all ages should continue to learn 3 feet apart, the CDC said.<br />Where that isn’t possible, the CDC said, classes should be held anyway in conjunction with other precautions like ventilation and cleaning. Even where Covid-19 cases are rising as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads, the CDC said that all students and teachers should continue to meet in person and that those who are unvaccinated should be tested weekly.<br />The guidance advances the CDC’s incremental rollback in recent months of measures adopted to prevent the spread of Covid-19. As vaccines have helped push new cases to a fraction of the peaks reached last winter, the CDC has moved in stages to relax its guidance on face masks, travel and schools.<br />“The one constant through this entire pandemic is change. We’re always monitoring,” said Erin Sauber-Schatz, lead for the CDC’s Community Interventions and Critical Populations Task Force.</td>

They collaborated with the company to prepare a joint review document presented to an FDA panel of outside advisers at a public meeting in 2020. The watchdog group Public Citizen called in December for an inspector general investigation “to scrutinize the unprecedented close collaboration.”<br />A Biogen spokesman said, “We will, of course, cooperate with any inquiry in connection with a possible review of the regulatory process.”</td>

      <td>A new exhibition explores the artistic and personal impact of travel on a Renaissance master.</td>
      <td>Albrecht Dürer was perhaps the most accomplished artist of the Northern Renaissance, the creator of stunning paintings like “Self-Portrait” and exquisite prints like “Melancholia I.” He was also, as a new exhibition reveals, an inveterate traveler whose journeys influenced his ambitions, his art and his impact. “Dürer Was Here: A Journey Becomes Legend,” opening July 18 at the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum in Aachen, Germany, commemorates his visit there in October 1520. A smaller version of the show will be on view at London’s National Gallery in November.<br />Born in 1471, Dürer first left his hometown of Nuremberg, Germany, around 1490. Over the next three decades he visited places in present-day France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. He crossed the Alps to visit Italy twice, possibly leaving home to escape the plague. Wherever he went, he viewed art, mixed with other artists, courted potential clients and further polished his glowing reputation. He sketched people, their dress and their surroundings, creating images he used in many later works. He also gambled and took dancing lessons.<br />Other artists of Dürer’s era traveled, but he alone extensively documented his sojourns in journals, drawings and letters. His account chronicling his trip to the Low Countries from July 1520 to July 1521 is particularly rich in details, listing amounts paid for inns and meals, tips bestowed to ease his way, and gifts both given and received. “As a glimpse into the life of a great artist of that time, this one-year trip is a fantastic opportunity to understand the economic, social and artistic realities of the era,” said Jonathan Bober, a senior curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.<br />The Aachen exhibition tells the story of those 12 months with 190 historical documents, drawings and paintings. Dürer based himself in bustling Antwerp, but he went to Aachen to see the coronation of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor. Using a new sketchbook, he drew the site of the ceremony, “Aachen Cathedral and the Katschhof” (1520), several town scenes and animals, like his realistic “Dog Resting” (1520). His main motive wasn’t artistic: Charles’s predecessor had granted Dürer a pension of 100 guilders a year for life, and the artist wanted to make sure the new emperor would renew it.<br />Charles did grant his wish and Dürer, back in Antwerp, started using it as a base for many excursions. He went to Zeeland to see a beached whale; in Brussels and Ghent he visited zoos and saw lions for the first time, making four drawings of one. He visited the famous Ghent Altarpiece by the van Eyck brothers and journeyed to Bruges, where he viewed Michelangelo’s marble “Madonna.”</td>

Add poverty and its history of raw race relations, and it looked combustible in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder. Instead, Detroit proved an exemplar.<br />While Minneapolis, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, Ore., and other cities burned, Detroit’s protests remained remarkably peaceful. The city saw minor skirmishes between demonstrators and officers, but neither police nor the Detroit Regional Chamber, a business group, can list a single incident of protest-related looting or arson.<br />Much credit goes to James Craig, the city’s police chief from 2013 until his retirement last month. He refused to tolerate political violence. He had cultivated deep relationships with the black community and political and civic leaders. He drew on this network to defuse tensions and protect Detroit.<br />Mr. Craig’s police career began here and took him to Los Angeles, Portland, Maine; and Cincinnati. A Republican, he is contemplating a challenge to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2022.</td>

In the past year, however, Minneapolis has become better known as a badly managed city adrift in politically correct mob rule. How did this once-great city fall so far so fast?<br />In 2009, Minneapolis adopted ranked-choice voting, then an untested method of electing city officials. It was sold to voters as a way to increase voter participation and improve the tone of political campaigns. In fact, it has had little positive effect on campaigns and their messaging, and voter turnout remains low. The corrosive effect of ranked-choice voting on democratic legitimacy is partly to blame for Minneapolis’s current dire condition.<br />In Minneapolis’s 2017 mayoral election (which was the third using ranked choice) voter turnout was only 43%. The victor in that 16-way race was Jacob Frey, who prevailed after six rounds of counting that took 24 hours to complete. He became mayor despite being the first choice of only 25% of voters.<br />Mr. Frey’s most notable first-term achievement was doing nothing last May while rioters burned and looted more than 1,300 buildings, causing an estimated $500 million of damage. He implied that destroying the city was a justifiable social-justice action. When a police precinct was burned to the ground, he showed no special concern. He did make time for a live television interview on MSNBC.</td>

Growing bipartisan support for lowering drug prices could give the current push a greater likelihood of success.<br />What isn’t in the executive order, however, is any mention of giving the federal Medicare agency the power to directly negotiate prices with drug companies. That approach, favored by many Democratic lawmakers, would potentially be more far-reaching than any of the measures in the presidential order.<br />“Negotiation of prices is the biggest and best solution” to lowering drug prices, said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit organization in Washington. The federal Medicare agency is generally barred by law from such direct negotiation for many prescription medicines, a ban many Democrats in Congress have urged be lifted.</td>

Ms. Jackson connected with the track and the pair rewrote it to reflect her own experiences. “[It] started her career and kind of ended ours—or at least our plans to do our album,” Mr. Jam said.<br />Instead of producing an album under their names, the often-bespectacled duo wrote and produced “Control,” the landmark 1986 album that made Ms. Jackson a superstar and is a fixture in greatest-of-all-time lists by publications like Rolling Stone and NPR. It also started a remarkable run of hits with Ms. Jackson that lasted through three decades, and influenced younger artists like Kendrick Lamar, H.E.R. and Beyoncé.<br />Now music fans will finally be able to hear “Jam & Lewis: Volume 1,” their debut under their own name, about 35 years after its initial conception. The pair doesn’t sing on this debut album, adhering instead to a long tradition by which superstar producers create an album-long statement by collaborating with some of their favorite artists. Other examples include Quincy Jones’ Grammy-winning 1981 album “The Dude,” and Mark Ronson’s 2019 album “Late Night Feelings.”<br />“Jam & Lewis: Volume 1,” out July 9, features stars the duo has worked with over their decades-long career including Usher, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men. But this time, instead of staying behind the scenes, the duo will be right on the cover of the album themselves.</td>

But “shortages of material inputs and difficulties in hiring have held down activity in a number of industries.”<br />Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver the report and testify on Capitol Hill next Wednesday and Thursday.<br />The report offered a few clues on how Fed officials are evaluating potential policy trade-offs that loom ahead and largely reviews recent developments in the economy. Since the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. in March 2020, the Fed has set interest rates near zero. It has said it expects to keep rates at that level until it is confident inflation will hold at its 2% target and the labor market has healed, or returned to what it calls “maximum employment.” The central bank is also buying $120 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage securities to hold down long-term rates, and it has committed to continue those purchases until achieving “substantial further progress” toward its inflation and employment goals.<br />For months, Mr. Powell had used pre-pandemic employment levels as a guide for what might meet a working definition of “maximum employment.” But Friday’s report suggested officials might be growing less confident about the possibility of returning to the labor market conditions of February 2020 without accepting higher inflation.</td>

      <td>An additional after-tax contribution to your 401(k)—now allowed in the plans of many large employers— can grow tax free if it’s moved to a Roth account</td>
      <td>If business titan Peter Thiel’s $5 billion tax-free individual retirement account has you jealous, here’s a way to build a pot of tax-free retirement savings without paying much in taxes: A mega-backdoor Roth conversion.<br />According to investigative news site ProPublica, over the past two decades, Mr. Thiel, a founder of  PayPal Holdings ,  Inc., turned less than $2000 of pre-IPO shares costing less than a penny each into $5 billion, a gain that accrued tax-free in his Roth IRA. If the 53-year-old refrains from taking withdrawals until age 59 ½ or older, that money can be shielded from tax forever.<br />Most people won’t ever get a chance to own pre-IPO stock. But the mega-backdoor Roth conversion strategy is available to many people with 401(k) accounts, so long as they have the means to save significant amounts of money. It lets those in 401(k) plans that allow after-tax contributions put up to $58,000 a year into a 401(k) account and convert some or all of the money to a Roth, with a minimal tax hit if executed well.<br />That vastly outstrips the $6,000 most people are permitted to put into a Roth IRA this year and the $19,500 annual limit on Roth 401(k) contributions. (Those levels rise, respectively, to $7,000 and $26,000 for those 50 or older.) The “mega” strategy also allows individuals with modified adjusted gross incomes of more than $140,000 a year—or $208,000 for couples—who would ordinarily be barred from contributing to a Roth IRA to get money into one.<br />“You could really see your Roth IRA grow exponentially this way,” said Ed Slott, an IRA specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y. “The best place retirement money can end up is in a Roth account, where it grows totally tax-free for the rest of our lives.”</td>

      <td>As sun-worshippers stream back to Santorini, Mykonos and other Greek islands, a crop of new hotels promise more coddling than crowds. Our guide to hopping back into vacation mode and avoiding potential pitfalls.</td>
      <td>MY FIRST NIGHT in Mykonos, a few weeks ago, the whitewashed hillside windmills overlooking the port were still, but I had all the fresh air I craved merely by being on the island. I was sitting on the stone steps of a seaside bar sipping a sundowner with a friend who had just arrived from New York City. I felt giddy, despite the occasional pang of doubt about abandoning over a year’s worth of deeply drilled-in safety precautions.<br />After 15 months of successive lockdowns in France, where I live, I viewed a few weeks lolling around the beaches of Greece as a sure cure to my thwarted wanderlust. As soon as the country reopened to foreign tourists in mid-May, I was ready to pounce. I wasn’t the only one champing at the bit for a Grecian holiday—the country welcomed 383,000 foreign visitors in May, with double that number expected in June. Before I booked my ticket, however, I wanted to be sure I wasn’t rushing into the decision. Was it safe and responsible to visit Greece at a time when the pandemic is subsiding in Europe and the U.S.—as more people get vaccinated—but is decidedly still not yet over?<br />Before I booked my trip, I did a little research: As of June 1, 34% of the Greek population of 10.5 million had received one dose of the vaccination. (As of early July, about 38% of the population had been fully vaccinated compared with about 48% of the U.S. population.) Besides the elderly, the government’s vaccination program prioritized residents of the country’s islands to help jump-start the country’s stalled tourism industry. Foreign tourists must either be vaccinated or show proof of a negative Covid test within 72 hours—and, in any case, are subject to random testing at airports and ferry terminals. (The CDC lists Greece as a Level 3 ”High” risk destination in terms of Covid, and urges all travelers to be vaccinated before visiting.) The new protocols aren’t foolproof, but they offered me enough assurance to book a nine-day trip in June. Even though fully vaccinated, however, I wasn’t quite ready to face hordes of travelers—truthfully, I never am, and especially not this year—so I devised an island-hopping trip that would let me check out a handful of new hotels well off the tourist path. A few were too pricey for my budget so instead of booking a room, I toured the properties and dined in their restaurants.<br />Before the pandemic, tourist numbers to Greece had been steadily rising. In 2019, the country counted a record 34 million arrivals. Scores of new hotels were in the pipeline to supply the growing demand, with many opening just before Covid hit or mid-pandemic. I zeroed in on four new properties sprinkled around the Cyclades archipelago and one in Athens. At a comfortable remove from popular tourist spots, they all seemed like ideal places for hesitant travelers like me to tiptoe back into the world. Aside from a few hitches along the way, each lived up to its promise.<br />I’ve traveled to Greece many times from my home in Paris, but I’d never been to Mykonos, writing it off as an island better suited to the party crowd. Though the party is still much smaller than usual, I sampled the infectiously convivial mood that first night as my friend and I sat at a waterfront bar in the Little Venice quarter of Mykonos town. Some 30 other patrons, speaking at least a dozen different languages, surrounded us. When a big wave slapped the bar’s flagstone-paved terrace, the Aegean spilled over 30 pairs of expensive-looking shoes and sandals. Registering their suddenly soaked feet, the crowd laughed communally—a signal, it seemed, to order another round of drinks.</td>

      <td>The founder of startup Joby Aviation believes vertical takeoff and landing vehicles will soon be a ‘cheaper, faster, safer’ and greener way of commuting.</td>
      <td>A serial entrepreneur with more than 40 patents to his name, JoeBen Bevirt traces his ingenuity as an engineer back to his “idyllic childhood” on a commune in the redwoods of Santa Cruz, Calif. Getting water, he explains, meant making sure the pump was running. Plowing the garden required checking the oil in the tractor. There was no electricity, so to use a computer, he had to know how to keep the batteries and inverter humming properly.<br />“I was viscerally involved in figuring out how you go from electrons to getting the lights to go on,” he says over Zoom from the ranch where he lives with his wife and four children, near where he grew up. “My friends in town just plugged things in and didn’t have to think about how it all worked.”<br />Mr. Bevirt, 47, was in grade school when he first fantasized about building a flying machine that could hop relatively short distances without needing a long runway or a noisy rotor. Getting home from school involved two city buses and a 5-mile walk up a dirt road, which gave him plenty of time “to dream about a better way,” he says. Now, after more than a decade of work and major advances in batteries and lightweight materials, he says that Joby Aviation, the company he founded and leads as chief executive, is “on the cusp” of making his dream a reality.<br />“Our mission is to transition people from driving to flying on a daily basis,” Mr. Bevirt says. Partnering with  Toyota Motor Corp.  and  Uber Technologies Inc.,  he plans to launch his aircraft in 2024 as a fleet of electric air taxis, which he says will ultimately be “cheaper, faster, safer” and greener than getting around on land. He contends that by shortening commutes, reducing carbon emissions and “pulling cars off the road,” these vehicles will reduce congestion, help cities replace parking lots with parks, and allow more people to “work at their dream job while living where they want to live.”<br />When Mr. Bevirt first began working in earnest on electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) vehicles, in 2009, most people thought he “was a little bit crazy,” he says. He was able to fund his experiments himself thanks to his success with a life-sciences robotics company that he sold to  Agilent Technologies  in 2007 and then with Joby Inc., which sells the popular Gorillapod line of flexible camera tripods, among other inventions.</td>

News Corp also agreed to produce new audio and video products as part of the pact.<br />Google agreed to pay News Corp tens of millions of dollars over the course of the deal, the Journal reported at the time.<br />In a statement Friday, News Corp said: “Knewz launched and grew in the midst of both a pandemic and a historic election, and advanced a distinct social purpose by offering true diversity of views at a time of extreme polarization, ultimately reaching and informing tens of millions of readers.”</td>
