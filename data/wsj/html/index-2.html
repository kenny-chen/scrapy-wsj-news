      <td>President Trump called Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Saturday to push for the state legislature to reverse President-elect Joe Biden’s win in the state, according to a person familiar with the call, the latest move in the president’s unprecedented push to overturn his election loss.<br />The call came hours before Mr. Trump was to travel to Georgia for a Saturday evening rally to support incumbent Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in the Jan. 5 runoffs, which will determine which party controls the Senate. Mr. Perdue is facing Democrat Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, and Ms. Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock, a pastor.<br />Republicans are eager for Mr. Trump’s help in driving voter turnout for the two GOP candidates, but some also fear that his efforts to portray the presidential election as “rigged,’’ and his criticism of state Republican leaders for their handling of balloting, will discourage his supporters from voting.<br />In his conversation with Mr. Kemp Saturday, Mr. Trump asked the governor to call a special session of the state legislature and push lawmakers to appoint pro-Trump electors who would swing the Electoral College in his favor, the person familiar with the call said. While federal law allows state legislatures to intervene in the process of appointing electors in the event the voting process fails on Election Day, no evidence of widespread election fraud has emerged in Georgia.<br />Mr. Kemp, a Republican, declined the president’s request, the person said. The Washington Post earlier reported details of the request. Mr. Kemp doesn’t plan to attend the rally.</td>

The company said it hopes to open a trial next year.<br />More than a dozen companies are competing to develop experimental treatments for sickle-cell disease, an inherited form of anemia that affects 100,000 mainly Black Americans.<br />The surge of interest has pushed a longstanding question to the fore: What good are new therapies for a disease if many patients suffering with it are unable, or choose not, to access them?<br />In one of the New England Journal of Medicine papers, two partners in developing a Crispr gene-editing therapy— Crispr Therapeutics  and  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. —reported that a patient with sickle-cell disease and a patient with another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, each received edited cells and more than a year later didn’t require blood transfusions. They said they have treated a total of 10 patients to date with sickle-cell disease or beta thalassemia with the Crispr therapy.</td>

      <td>The words we use to praise and insult dishes have changed dramatically over time.</td>
      <td>Not so long ago, if you had invited someone over for a meal of something charred, they would have assumed that you were apologizing for burning dinner. Yet now, “charred” is desirable. It signifies food that is robust, deeply flavored and cooked in a modern way, whether on a hot skillet or grill or roasted in an oven.<br />Browsing cookbooks the other day, I noticed that many of the words we now use to praise dishes once would have been considered insults. I found recipes that call for ingredients to be “crushed,” “smashed,” “fermented,” “vinegared” and “sour,” as well as “burned” or “charred.” There was charred corn, charred broccoli, hot charred cherry tomatoes with cold yogurt, every kind of charred meat, charred tofu and even charred butter with lemons.<br />Tastes change from one generation to the next, and this is as true of food words as it is of foods themselves. Such shifts in vocabulary reflect wider social trends. The vogue for charred vegetables and fermented everything goes along with new concerns about health, as well as more globalized attitudes to cooking. We have shaken off the tired old belief that French is the only language in the kitchen. The Mexican “sofrito” and the Indian “tadka” have taken their rightful place alongside the French “mirepoix”—all of them referring to a preparation of finely chopped, flavorsome vegetables.<br />Back in the 1990s, American grocery stores would place a premium on foods that were “imported,” meaning foreign and therefore glamorous. Now it is the “local,” the “sustainable” and the “seed-to-table” that are prized. Cooks of earlier generations might have seen a smashed carrot salad as a failed carrot purée, but we now see such rough-hewn dishes as healthy and natural.<br />Often our attachment to food words is a proxy for craving certain flavors and textures. I am old enough to remember a time when the greatest compliment you could pay a cake was to say it was “light as a feather.” In Gloria Pitzer’s “Better Cookery Book” from 1983, a Yellow Colonial Cake is described as “Perfect, yellow, light-as-a-feather layer cake.” But today’s baking books are just as likely to praise a cake for being “dense,” particularly if it is a chocolate loaf cake.</td>

      <td>An unexpected side-effect of lockdowns: It can be easier to get a meeting with a venture capitalist. For minority founders in tech, that’s made a big difference as Silicon Valley reckons with race issues.</td>
      <td>The world of venture capital is notoriously insular. For tech startups hoping to attract millions of dollars from private investors, having the right connections is often key to getting a meeting—and persuading investors to take a chance on an unproven idea. The result: getting seed funding has always been harder for Silicon Valley outsiders, including startups from outside New York City and the Bay Area, and founders from minority backgrounds. The numbers are particularly stark for Black founders: Between 2013 and 2017, 77% of founders of active U.S. startups that had received venture capital were white. Only 1% were Black.<br />But something unexpected is happening during this chaotic year: Owing to a convergence of factors, some Black founders of tech startups are finding that it’s easier to attract investment.<br />For starters, pandemic lockdowns have made investors easier to reach. Many are now more accessible through Zoom and social media. This has eliminated not just physical barriers but also psychological barriers to funding companies outside of startup hubs like New York City and the Bay Area.<br />Black founders also say that the killing of George Floyd, subsequent protests and the broader cultural movement that has ensued have caused the VC industry to reckon with its track record of funding minority founders. Many companies and investors—including SoftBank, Google, PayPal, and Andreessen Horowitz—have announced diversity-focused funds and started cutting checks from them.<br />“Never did we think 2020 would be a tipping point for ShearShare,” says Courtney Caldwell, co-founder of the company sometimes known as “Hairbnb,” which uses a marketplace approach to match hairstylists with salon owners.</td>

      <td>Chanterria McGilbra, a San Francisco-based biotech consultant, on her 2015 Ferrari 458 Spider, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />I’m one of those people who believes in messages and signs. One day in 2015, I was in the shower and the word Ferrari came to me. I thought, “That’s weird.” Day after day for a week, I would get in the shower and the word Ferrari would come to me. Finally, I went to the dealership in Mill Valley, Calif. I went through all the cars and when I saw the 458, I said, “I want to test-drive that one.” They said, “OK, come back tomorrow and we’ll have one you can drive.”<br />The next day one of the guys there pulled this car out and we went up a hill. He hit the gas. In the passenger seat, I felt the G-force and it was one of the most thrilling things I ever felt in my life. When I got behind the wheel, I punched the gas, and it was even more thrilling. That was it: I had to have this car.<br /><br />Ordering a new Ferrari is not like ordering other cars. I spent two weeks going back and forth, designing it. At first I wanted it all chocolate color, exterior and interior. They talked me out of it. I ended up selecting titanium paint, a chocolate-colored suede interior, and a black dashboard that would not distract from the driving experience. I put carbon fiber everywhere I could. I chose yellow brake calipers, which matched the yellow in the Ferrari logo. (It is the traditional color of founder Enzo Ferrari’s hometown—Modena, Italy.) All these decisions and more made my car unique—one of one, built that year.</td>

Khaldoon al-Mubarak wanted to know how bad things could get.<br />Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son assured the chief executive of Mubadala Investment Co. that a fund housing $15 billion of Mubadala’s money was diverse enough to withstand the storm. BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink explained to Mr. Mubarak how government stimulus could boost the U.S. economy. Egon Durban, co-CEO of private-equity firm Silver Lake, argued the market had become too bearish and was overlooking an eventual vaccine.<br />“In those early days I was on the phone all the time,” said the 44-year-old Mr. Mubarak, a Tufts University graduate who sports a crew cut and is as comfortable in a suit as a traditional Emirati thobe. “For me, it was instrumental in really forming a view.”<br />The view that emerged was that the world would eventually bounce back from the pandemic and that an unprecedented crisis would bring big opportunities. Mr. Mubarak staked billions on that belief, committing to new investment partnerships with U.S. private-equity giants  Apollo Global Management Inc.  and Silver Lake while making new bets on everything from  Alphabet Inc.’s  self-driving car effort to a firm working on a coronavirus vaccine trial.<br />He made this push while many of his peers pulled back. Mubadala  invested more than $11 billion this year as of December 1, according to consulting firm Global SWF, up 46% from the entirety of last year. That compares with a 36% decline in new capital deployed by all sovereign funds over the same period. A larger United Arab Emirates fund, the $500 billion Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, is among those that invested less, according to Global SWF. ADIA declined to comment.</td>

Salvador Cienfuegos, who served as defense minister from 2012 to 2018, was arrested for allegedly taking bribes to protect the operations of a drug cartel. The surprise arrest in Los Angeles, as the general and his wife were starting a California vacation, stirred an outcry among high-ranking Mexican officers.<br />The military is a key ally of the Mexican president, one he can ill afford to alienate. Top officers were angered that Gen. Cienfuegos had been arrested by U.S. authorities outside Mexico and would be judged in the U.S., two senior Mexican government officials said. Officers saw this as a humiliation and a violation of Mexico’s sovereignty. Others also believed the general was innocent.<br />The arrest awakened nationalist anti-American passions in the armed forces, said former Foreign Minister Jorge Castañeda.<br />“This is a hard blow to Mexico’s image and for its armed forces,” an active-duty general wrote to Mr. Castañeda in a WhatsApp message, according to Mr. Castañeda. “Cienfuegos is innocent,” the active-duty general added. “This is a totally abusive and arbitrary action by the U.S. I consider it an insult to Mexico.”</td>

The widely used financial tool—which has been a source of support for the record-setting stock market—has been attacked by some academics and progressive politicians. Now, those politicians will be in a better position to do something about it.<br />Buybacks have been a particularly hot issue since 2018 when, under terms of the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts, big U.S. companies repatriated billions of dollars that had been stashed for years in overseas tax havens. In the resulting binge, the dollar value of big companies’ repurchases of their own stock shot up 55% to a record $806 billion. Buyback foes complained that such repurchases enriched shareholders, generally wealthier Americans, at the expense of workers, new plants and research, and broader economic development<br />Buybacks are down about 30% this year, as companies conserve cash to ride out the pandemic. But the issue remains prominent for Democrats who just took the White House and retained the House as they plan their legislative and regulatory agenda.<br />With that in mind, here is what investors need to know about buybacks—and why they are controversial.</td>

It is  the only body that until now had been under control of regime adversaries.<br />Although the U.S. and most European and Latin American governments consider the vote a charade, Mr. Maduro’s main goal is to make opposition leader Juan Guaidó irrelevant. Mr. Guaidó has been recognized as Venezuela’s rightful leader since January 2019 by the Trump administration and more than 50 countries in Latin America and Europe, and his claim is predicated on being the head of the National Assembly.</td>

Russia approved the shot, named Sputnik V, in August, despite criticism from Western scientists about the lack of large-scale clinical trial data at the time.<br />Moscow’s inoculation campaign comes days after the U.K. authorized a vaccine by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  that is expected to be rolled out beginning next week. That shot is also being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S., where a similar authorization could come later this month and a rollout starting before the end of the year.<br />On Saturday, Russia reported a record 28,782 new cases, with the total tally at over 2.4 million. Russia’s cumulative caseload since the onset of the pandemic is behind only the U.S., India and Brazil.<br />In Moscow, which also registered a record number of new cases, some 70 vaccination centers located in hospitals and clinics opened their doors on Saturday morning.</td>

      <td>Consumer-product makers are under pressure to pitch in as customers and lawmakers pay more attention to plastic waste</td>
      <td>Who should pay to recycle discarded cereal boxes, drinks bottles and detergent containers?<br />The makers of such products have long fought efforts to make them pay for the cost of dealing with packaging waste. Now, trade groups that represent companies like  Procter & Gamble Co.  and  PepsiCo Inc.  are softening that stance, as consumers become more concerned about plastic waste and municipalities struggle to cover the costs of their recycling programs.<br />Federal and state lawmakers in the U.S. are proposing bills to push companies to pick up the tab for managing empty soda bottles, candy wrappers, cereal boxes and other packaging they use. Such rules could help pay for curbside collection and sorting infrastructure, and spur companies to design packaging that is easier to recycle, lawmakers say.<br />Charging companies “puts the financial burden of plastic pollution back on the manufacturers who generate it and profit from it,” said Sen. Tom Udall (D., N.M.), who this year introduced a bill that would make companies pay to collect and process waste. Several states including Massachusetts, New York and Washington are considering similar measures.<br />Packaging has become more complex of late, often being a mix of materials such as aluminum layered with different plastics to make baby and pet-food pouches. Most recycling facilities can’t handle these. Also, a 2018 ban on waste imports by China, historically the biggest buyer of used plastic from the U.S., created a glut of recyclables with nowhere to go. Ninety two recycling programs have been eliminated in the U.S. since late 2017, according to the Recycling Partnership, a nonprofit.</td>

      <td>Whether it’s for a backyard ‘minimony’ or a public-park ‘micro-wedding,’ ‘corona brides’ are getting creative with jumpsuits, short dresses and other options that Grandma would hate</td>
      <td>IN MY FAMILY, we classify life’s challenges into two tiers: problems and “prombles.” A problem is a broken bone; a “promble” is a broken pencil. In the omnishambles of the coronavirus pandemic, being forced to reimagine one’s wedding is a mere ‘promble.’ But that doesn’t make it feel any less gutting to the many couples worldwide who have either postponed or drastically scaled back their nuptials this year. Elaborate country-club weddings and tropical destination events were downsized to “minimonies” (tiny weddings), “micromonies” (another word for tiny weddings) and intimate backyard affairs. Grandma stayed home. Banquets became slices of pizza. And over-the-top poofy dresses chosen by committee became jumpsuits and minidresses purchased online, worn with white face masks.<br />By the time I was enlisted to officiate my friend Alice Newell-Hanson’s New York City wedding in September, it had gone from being a 180-person warehouse rager to a four-person affair under a tree among the pigeons and hookah-puffers of Washington Square Park. The bride’s original dress—a floor-length embroidered gown fit for a very chic Renaissance Faire—was replaced by a shorter white Proenza Schouler dress with a leather buttoned belt. In the same amount of time it took me to become a reverend of the American Marriage Ministries (five minutes), the bride bought her new dress online. “Knowing we weren’t going to have tons of family there gave me a new sense of freedom. The dress didn’t have to be something that my relatives would ‘get,’” Alice said, adding that her family back in England was particularly mystified by the belt. She has no regrets: “I think I’m going to like what I wore better in the long run because it really just felt like me.”<br />Many “corona brides” (as they call themselves on social media) I spoke to expressed a similar silver-lining sentiment. Few mourn the extravagant confections designed to make an entrance on a curving staircase. Perhaps the minimal, less exorbitant gown is a cooler, more contemporary look anyway. Just look at Lily Allen, the British singer who wed this fall on a small scale in Las Vegas. Her short, tailored Dior dress looked just right—even iconic—for her wedding pictures at the burger joint In N’ Out.<br />Dyanna Villaluna Volek, 36, a government affairs manager for the San Francisco International Airport, had planned a 150-person gala at the airport’s museum for this November. While she originally bought multiple “very traditional” vintage options to choose from to fit the event’s 1920s theme, she ended up renting a simpler gown from Rent the Runway to wear with an unorthodox  Etsy  cape for her revised tiny public-park ceremony. When the nuptials had come and gone, she went to a  FedEx  shop to return the dress and remembers thinking, “Shouldn’t I feel more connected to my wedding dress?” But she realized, “I think that was like the whole ceremony in and of itself, we mourned what was supposed to be for a little bit and then we let it go and then something better came along.”<br />Should you choose to buy rather than rent a gown, one advantage of going for a simpler design is that it can be worn again. Vanessa Cocchiaro, a Paris-based Australian designer with a thriving bridal business, makes wearable pieces like jumpsuits and slip dresses, most of which sell for under $1,000. While she’s watched friends who design couture-level clothing close their businesses, she said her affordable and modern dresses are flying out the door, purchased for intimate Covid-era ceremonies. An Australian client of Ms. Cocchiaro’s was originally going to wear “a princess dress” but when she reconceived her wedding as a humbler affair, opted instead for one of Ms. Cocchiaro’s short frocks. The designer explained, “She said she still felt bridal-ish but beautiful and it’s something that she’s going to wear again and again.”</td>

      <td>An exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art shows how artists used the most elemental of creative practices—drawing—to reinvent their world.</td>
      <td>New York<br />Because drawing is more modest in scale and intimate in its mode of address than many of the other forms of contemporary art being shown today, it is easy to overlook or take for granted. Kudos to the Museum of Modern Art, then, for thrusting it into the conversation with “Degree Zero: Drawing at Midcentury.” The show covers the years 1948-61, when in the aftermath of World War II artists felt art itself had to be reinvented from the ground up and chose that most fundamental of processes, drawing, for the task. At every turn “Degree Zero” upends our expectations to tell us something new about what was going on at that time.<br />The approximately 80 works here were all drawn from MoMA’s collection by Associate Curator Samantha Friedman, the show’s organizer, and have been installed with sufficient space between them to permit safe viewing at close quarters. They were made by artists from Latin America, Asia and Africa in addition to Europe and North America, until recently the museum’s almost exclusive focus. So along with MoMA pantheon members like Henri Matisse and Jackson Pollock, we encounter the likes of Jean Dubuffet, Willys de Castro, Otto Piene and Yayoi Kusama, as well as names likely to be as new to the general public as they were to me. This broad-gauge approach is nothing less than revelatory, forcing us to think differently about certain exalted reputations as a result.<br />The show’s theme is poignantly captured in an untitled charcoal and chalk drawing by the French abstractionist Hans Hartung from 1960. It consists of closely abutting dark, black vertical marks of almost uniform length. On the one hand it reads as a kind of existentialist manifesto, “I draw, therefore I am.” Yet at the same time, the individual parts seem to be in the process of resolving themselves into an image—art coming into being before our eyes.<br />Among the unforgettable discoveries is Sonja Sekula (1918-1963), who divided her time between the U.S. and her native Switzerland, where, the label tells us, she underwent treatment for mental illness. “The Voyage” (1956) is a jewel-like, ink-and-watercolor work organized into a loose grid. Each of its panels is a different color and obsessively filled with a dense web of lines and minuscule circles within which the only recognizable image is that of a ship. It is a mesmerizing, vertiginous record of the journey through a charged interior landscape that demands—and rewards—prolonged, close scrutiny. A pity, then, that it’s hung almost too high to be seen properly.</td>

      <td>The films collected in a new Blu-ray set are precious records of the Yiddish cinema that was virtually extinguished by the Holocaust.</td>
      <td><br /><br />Technologies come and go in the film world, but rarely whole cultures. That’s one reason why movies in Yiddish prove so fascinating. They are fundamentally different from other objects of bygone days. Whereas, say, silent pictures from Denmark or Japan document the past, there remains an unbroken link between such movies and new ones produced in those countries today. Not so for Yiddish films, which are truly relics from a vanished world. Equally significant, Yiddish movies are distinguished by their extra-nationality. They were produced not in a single country, but rather on two continents an ocean apart, primarily in the U.S. and Poland.<br />The American debut of a collection of recently restored Yiddish films offers a precious peek into what has largely been a void for most of us. “The Jewish Soul” contains 10 pictures on five Blu-rays and marks another significant collaboration between the Paris-based Lobster Films, which managed the difficult reconstructions and initially released them in France, and Kino Lorber, which added bonus materials and is distributing the package stateside. (The set is also available for purchase, and several titles can be rented, digitally via the Kino Now platform at kinonow.com.)<br />Yiddish cinema’s great tragedy was its short life. It didn’t really take off until the mid-1930s, and the form was virtually extinguished by the Holocaust, though filming in America limped along till roughly 1950. There had been silent films—“The Golem” (1915), from Germany, is perhaps the best example—that dealt with Jewish themes and characters, but the absence of spoken dialogue left them bereft of a vital aspect: the sound of Yiddish itself, the innately musical, profoundly emotional and irrepressibly funny language of Ashkenazi Jewry.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—An enduring mystery of the Covid-19 pandemic is why East Asian countries across the board have experienced far fewer cases and deaths than the U.S. and Europe.<br />Some doctors and scientists are beginning to take a closer look at theories that some people in East Asia and Southeast Asia have had different exposure to previous coronaviruses resembling the SARS-CoV-2 virus sweeping the globe. Such exposure could have protected them from getting sick from Covid-19 or lessened the severity of the disease.<br />Others doubt that the immune systems of people in the region differ from people in the rest of the world in any systematic way. They suspect cultural factors and, in some countries, government policies such as tightly enforced quarantines are playing the main role.<br />Whatever the case, doctors agree that some explanation is needed for why Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore all have experienced at most a few thousand new SARS-CoV-2 infections a day, even during the current surge. That compares with tens of thousands of daily cases in many European nations and more than 150,000 new cases on many days in the U.S.<br />Yasuhiro Suzuki has pondered the question as the highest-ranking doctor in the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare’s medical corps until his retirement in August.</td>

Sanford said it decided to call off the proposed pairing with the appointment last week of its new CEO, Bill Gassen.<br />“With this leadership change, it’s an important time to refocus our efforts internally as we assess the future direction of our organization,” Mr. Gassen said.<br />Mr. Krabbenhoft had planned to serve as president emeritus of the combined hospital system after the merger. The former CEO’s final weeks at Sanford were tumultuous, following an email he sent to staff in which he said he wouldn’t wear a mask after recovering from Covid-19. The board and Mr. Krabbenhoft “mutually agreed to part ways,” Sanford said last week.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal judge in Brooklyn on Friday ordered the Trump administration to fully restore the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, meaning the government will once more have to accept new applications for the program that protects immigrants living in the U.S. since childhood without legal permission.<br />The order concludes a three-year legal battle over the Trump administration’s attempt to kill DACA, which the Supreme Court ruled it did improperly because it didn’t follow the proper procedure for federal policy-making.<br />That means, for the first time since September 2017, new applicants who weren’t previously eligible, typically because they were too young, may now apply for the program. The Friday ruling also asks the government to issue two-year permits for it.<br />“Today’s decision from a federal judge in New York is a victory for the courageous directly impacted plaintiffs, all DACA recipients and DACA-eligible youth,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, state and local policy manager for United We Dream and herself a DACA recipient.<br />The DACA program was created by the Obama administration in 2012 to offer work permits and deportation protections to young immigrants, known as Dreamers, who have been living in the country without legal permission since childhood. To apply, an immigrant must have arrived in the U.S. before age 16, lived in the country since 2007 and have a high-school diploma or a GED.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A California billionaire gave $333,800 to Republican Party accounts in 2016 and then enlisted the help of Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington lawyer, to push White House officials to recommend a pardon for a friend, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Sanford Diller, a philanthropist, was seeking the pardon of Hugh Baras, a California psychologist who was sentenced in 2014 to more than two years in prison for tax evasion and theft of government property, and said it was the one favor he sought in exchange for his donations, the documents reviewed by the Journal show.<br />The matter drew the attention of federal investigators. A court filing in federal district court in Washington unsealed earlier this week indicated that communications involving Mr. Lowell were at issue in an investigation of an alleged “secret lobbying scheme” and potential bribery in exchange for the pardon.<br />The court filing was heavily redacted but the roles of Mr. Lowell and Mr. Diller were confirmed this week by people familiar with the case and documents reviewed by the Journal. Their identities were earlier reported by the New York Times.<br />The Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section was investigating the case, according to people familiar with the investigation, and its status is unknown. The Justice Department declined to comment. “It is my understanding that the Justice Department had and has absolutely no quarrel with anything that Abbe did in this matter,” an attorney for Mr. Lowell, Reid Weingarten, said, adding: “There was no bribe, there was no clemency, this is what the prosecutors concluded and this entire matter is much ado about nothing.”</td>

(Unlike most recording artists of his stature, Mr. Bennett isn’t signed to a record label.) Five years ago, for example, the two longtime friends—Mr. Corcoran is about three years older—had only a 15-person team handling tasks like marketing and selling merchandise.<br />News of a rift between Chance the Rapper and his manager comes during the rockiest period of the artist’s career to date.</td>

      <td>Federal program allowing states to make Medicaid recipients work has been blocked by lower courts</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court said Friday it would consider the legality of a Trump administration program allowing states to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients.<br />Lower courts have blocked the program, which stripped health insurance from recipients who didn’t file paperwork demonstrating they were working or otherwise complying with or exempt from the requirements. Those courts found that the requirements interfered with Medicaid’s statutory purpose of  expanding health-care coverage for lower-income Americans.<br />In its Supreme Court appeal, the Trump administration argues that the secretary of Health and Human Services has broad discretion to authorize experimental projects to test policies that could further Medicaid’s purpose. The administration argues that promoting recipients’ economic self-sufficiency could improve “health outcomes”—for example, by “‘incentiviz[ing] beneficiaries to engage in their own health care”—and therefore is in line with the goals Congress established for Medicaid.<br />The case the high court agreed to hear centers on Arkansas, which in March 2018 was granted a waiver allowing it to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients through Dec. 31, 2021.<br />The waiver, which authorized a program called Arkansas Works, was in effect for 10 months before being blocked by a federal court.  “More than 18,000 people (about 25% of those subject to the work requirement) lost coverage as a result of the project in just five months,” a federal appeals court noted.</td>

Democrats and Republicans leapt on the news as justification for the $1 trillion spending bill they want to pass before the end of the year.<br />Joe Biden called the report “grim” and “shows an economy that’s stalling,” while White House economist Peter Navarro said the numbers mean “there’s a train wreck coming, folks” and it’s Congress’s “job to flip the switches so, so the trains don’t hit.” Bad economic news is good political news when you want to spend taxpayer money.<br />Yet the jobs report was hardly a disaster, as payrolls expanded in the month by a net 245,000 new jobs and the jobless rate fell to 6.7%. The private economy did even better with 344,000 new jobs, offset by a decline in government payrolls—mainly due to the end of 93,000 temporary census jobs. State and local governments lost a net of 13,000, nearly all of that related to local school closures.<br />Much of the economy is still recovering well from the pandemic recession, as manufacturing and construction both added 27,000 jobs in the month. Transportation and warehousing had a gangbusters month with 145,000 new hires, as  Amazon  continues to hire as many as 1,400 workers a day.  Walmart  has added tens of thousands of new U.S. workers since March, as its online sales have soared, and this week it announced more than $700 million in new cash bonuses for employees. The retailer has paid $2.8 billion in employee bonuses this year.<br />The struggling parts of the economy are smaller retailers, small businesses and consumer services hit by greater social distancing amid the sharp spike in Covid infections. Hiring for the holiday season was below normal. Restaurants and bars, which had been recovering, shed 17,400 jobs in the month.</td>

On Monday he vetoed a bill providing liability protections for schools, businesses and other employers against Covid-related lawsuits.<br />Mr. Wolf in May issued an executive order protecting health-care workers and owners of real estate that was donated for Covid emergency services. His order doesn’t protect businesses from lawsuits by customers who catch Covid. The bill passed by the GOP Legislature did.<br />Nearly 80 associations representing schools, child-care providers, small businesses and others backed the bill. “For the foreseeable future,” they wrote in a letter to Mr. Wolf, “employers will be subject to strict workplace health and safety requirements and those who adopt these precautions should proceed with confidence knowing they will not be targeted with frivolous, and potentially devastating, litigation.”<br />The legislation wouldn’t absolve businesses that disregard public-health requirements. But its higher standards for lawsuits, requiring clear and convincing evidence of gross negligence, could head off many frivolous suits. More than a dozen states including Michigan and Idaho have enacted similar legislation. Mr. Wolf said the legislation was too broad and unnecessary, but businesses with their livelihoods on the line disagree.<br />His veto is especially worrisome given the state’s plaintiff-friendly legal climate. Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court and Philadelphia’s Court of Common Pleas top the American Tort Reform Association’s list of “Judicial Hellholes” this year. The report notes that Pennsylvania has one of the nation’s highest payout rates in medical liability suits, and Philadelphia is a top jurisdiction for asbestos litigation.</td>

But her opponent, Rita Hart, is dusting off a 1969 federal statute to have the House of Representatives pick the winner. That means Democrats in Washington could overrule Iowa voters to seat a co-partisan and grow their majority.<br />The Iowa race was decided by six votes. The counting went on for weeks as 24 counties canvassed and recanvassed over 390,000 ballots, and lawyers from both sides haggled with election officials over machine counting, ballot qualifications and voter intent.<br />Normally this exhaustive process would end matters. Not this year. Ms. Hart’s campaign said it will bypass an Iowa court appeal and ask the Committee on House Administration to intervene. The House has final say on its Members’ elections and the Supreme Court has held that courts can’t intervene in those decisions under the Constitution’s Article I.<br />That means the count in Iowa’s 2nd District will become a political fight rather than a legal one. House Democrats in 1985 took advantage of the same process to reverse Indiana’s state certification of a Republican winner in a Congressional race. They refused to seat either candidate in January, and in May declared the Democrat the winner after their recount excluded 32 absentee votes.</td>

      <td>Activision Blizzard Inc.  is suing  Netflix Inc.  for allegedly poaching its former finance chief and causing competitive harm, citing a pattern of behavior by the streaming giant.<br />In a complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Friday, the videogame publishing company said Netflix illegally recruited Spencer Neumann in late 2018, prompting a contract breach that disrupted business operations. Activision said the move also cost it business opportunities as well as millions of dollars paid out to retain other executives.<br />Mr. Neumann, who previously held roles at the  Walt Disney Co.  and private-equity firms, joined Activision as its finance chief in May 2017. The employment contract initially carried a three-year term.<br />“Netflix has a demonstrated pattern of caring only about attracting and employing whoever Netflix wants, regardless of whether it violates the law along the way,” the suit claims.<br />A spokesman for Netflix declined to comment on the lawsuit.</td>

      <td>Relocation of 700 troops from Somalia reverses administration course; move follows troop cuts in Iraq, Afghanistan</td>
      <td>President Trump ordered the Pentagon to pull nearly all U.S. troops out of Somalia, where for 13 years they have been fighting a low-intensity battle against the local al Qaeda affiliate, al-Shabaab, U.S. officials said.<br />The roughly 700 troops stationed in Somalia would move to bases in Kenya and Djibouti and enter Somalia to conduct shorter counterterrorism missions against al-Shabaab, as well as a smaller force of Islamic State militants. The U.S. troops are expected to leave the country by early next year, the officials said.<br />The move, supported by the new acting defense secretary, Chris Miller, effectively reverses the course set by his predecessor, Mark Esper. Mr. Esper favored drawing down U.S. forces operating in the volatile Sahel region of West Africa while maintaining the American presence in Somalia, according to a senior U.S. official.<br />The Pentagon, in a statement sent to lawmakers Friday, said that despite the withdrawal, U.S. aims in Somalia hadn’t changed. “We will continue to degrade violent extremist organizations that could threaten our homeland while ensuring we maintain our strategic advantage in great power competition,” the statement said.<br />The Trump administration’s push to reduce U.S. forces in Africa has drawn opposition from lawmakers from both parties who see a need for a continued American engagement in the continent’s conflict zones. Rep. Anthony Brown (D., Md.), vice chairman of the Armed Services Committee, questioned the wisdom ofsuch troop moves during a presidential transition in Washington.</td>

      <td>Two strikingly different ways of seeing the world, ordering society and understanding human destiny.</td>
      <td>Every man and every woman, it seems, knows Gilbert and Sullivan’s quipping lines from “Iolanthe” (1882): “That every boy and every gal / That’s born into the world alive. / Is either a little Liberal / Or else a little Conservative.” When the lines were first sung, the labels matched up with Britain’s political parties, but they obviously have a wider application—each calling to mind, then and now, a cultural outlook, an inclination, a temperament, even a philosophy. Over time, of course, even the firmest definition will shift, making easy summary difficult and historical circumstance—context, that is—crucial to our understanding of what “liberalism” is and how “conservatism” differs from it. These days, we may also ask: What sets the two sides of democratic politics so far apart?<br />Edmund Fawcett, a former editor and correspondent at the Economist, grappled with one end of this polarity in “Liberalism: The Life of an Idea,” published in 2014 and revised four years later. He now explores its opposing force in “Conservatism: The Fight for a Tradition.” A self-described left-wing liberal, Mr. Fawcett believes that both categories of thought (and politics) are facing critical tests, making it all the more urgent that we grasp their genealogy—how they developed and what they have come to represent. He calls his explorations “historical essays,” and indeed they are written in a reflective mode, though at times in an impassioned style. Members of both thought-categories will find much to learn from both books, not least from the historical figures Mr. Fawcett brings into view.<br />Mr. Fawcett notes that, in the broadest terms, the modern era in advanced societies has been governed by a liberal outlook, one in which the liberty or freedom of the individual has been increasingly protected from the state or “liberated” from custom, hierarchy and the institutions—notably, the church—that once dictated social relations and guided man’s understanding of himself. The origins of this outlook, he notes, can be traced to the Enlightenment, when “reason” was elevated to an exalted position and, it was believed, a rational scrutiny of both principles and institutions would lead humanity away from dark superstition and upward toward the light.<br />Enlightenment thinkers, Mr. Fawcett reminds us, encouraged the idea that society might be understood and thereby changed for the better. They also sought to sever moral codes from their traditional mooring, or at least to rethink them: As Mr. Fawcett puts it, David Hume and Immanuel Kant “welcomed liberty from ethical tutelage” so that men could determine their own standards of conduct. The German statesman Wilhelm von Humboldt saw education as a way to realize individual possibility rather than, as tradition would have it, train for an occupation or a social role. Benjamin Constant, in France, focused on the concept of liberty, which he defined as a condition of existence allowing people to turn away interference from either society or the state. Calling absolute power radically illegitimate, François Guizot insisted that human imperfection meant that no person, class, faith or interest should have the final say. Like other French liberals of his day, he sought a juste milieu—a place where interests and ideas could be balanced. Enlightenment philosophers on the Continent also challenged the assumptions of the ancien régime, helping open careers to talent and remove restrictions on office-holding long governed by religion and class.<br />These currents of thought we associate with the 18th century, and for good reason, but after the shock of the American and French revolutions, they were dammed up by the Napoleonic Wars and an interlude of restoration. It was only in the 1830s that the dam broke. A period of rapid change—brought on by the dislocations of the Industrial Revolution, the railway’s remarkable shrinking of distance, and episodes of agricultural depression and financial crisis—demanded a re-assessment of established patterns of thought and governance. Enlightenment-driven liberalism was one mode of response; conservatism, one might say, was a response to the response.</td>

      <td>Children from wealthy families will always have access to high-achieving schools, but for low-income families of all races the exam schools are their best chance for an equally high-level education.</td>
      <td>Regarding Chester E. Finn Jr.’s “A Progressive Assault on Selective High Schools” (op-ed, Nov. 27): Ironically, eliminating the test-based admission process for entry to the country’s elite high schools would hurt the ethnic groups that its proponents are trying to help. Children from wealthy families will always have access to high-achieving schools, but for low-income families of all races the exam schools are their best chance for an equally high-level education. Eliminating the admission tests would destroy the elite schools and eliminate the only chance that poor, especially inner-city students have of receiving an education equal or better than that offered by the private city and wealthy suburban schools.<br />A well-designed exam measures not only what a student has learned but, more importantly, their capacity to learn new things. This is especially important for boys whose maturity level often lags behind their intellectual ability. The elite public schools have turned millions of poor children of all races into today’s leaders.<br />Every child should be academically challenged at a level they can handle. Attending an elite school is only one of many paths to success in life.<br />André Montero<br />Brooklyn Technical High School, ’64</td>

      <td>From his chaotic childhood to a lifetime as consort to the queen, Prince Philip has remained irrepressibly himself.</td>
      <td>As I was growing up, our monarchist British household considered Prince Philip a rather louche character. “It’s all very well for him,” my mother would comment tartly after the latest outrage—a caustic riposte, a scandalous gaffe or a “perfectly dreadful” brown hat worn on some royal tour. “He can say or do whatever he likes, but the queen can’t.”<br />Her comments were unfair. After all, Prince Philip had given up an illustrious career in his beloved Royal Navy to spend the next 70-some years of his life walking two steps behind the queen. A driven, restless and highly energetic man, he was not cut out for a secondary role. Yet as my father, born two months after Philip, was given to say: “You just get on with it.” And the prince consort did. In her biography “Prince Philip Revealed,” Ingrid Seward writes that above all he has been loyal. “For him duty is at the center of everything. It is not a choice.”<br />Royal biographies tend to fall into two categories: reverent, the subject’s imperfections whitewashed; or waspish, a chronicle of backstairs gossip. A clue into which category Ms. Seward’s book falls is provided on the back flap of the book jacket. The editor of a British magazine called Majesty (devoted entirely—surprise—to royals), she appears in a photograph alongside his royal highness, gazing up at him with a worshipful smile.<br />Do we really need yet another book on Prince Philip? What more is there to say about the man? Not a lot. But you can’t believe everything you see in Netflix’s “The Crown.” Ms. Seward’s biography is more than mere hagiography, although it is indeed reverential. And while she takes us painstakingly over well-trodden ground, she does produce some interesting information about Philip’s later years, in particular his relationships with Diana and Meghan Markle.<br />Prince Philip is the most intriguing member of the royal family. His childhood was bizarre. He was born on a dining table in a villa on Corfu, Greece, the youngest in a family of four sisters. His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was stone deaf (she became a skilled lip reader in four languages). His half-Danish father, Prince Andrew, second in line to the Greek throne, was sentenced to death after the army was defeated in Smyrna by the Turks, saved only by the intervention of George V. In 1930, after eight years of impecunious exile in Paris, the family dispersed. Philip’s sisters married (two of them to high-ranking Nazis); his mother, now mentally ill, was committed to a sanatorium; his father moved to Monte Carlo with his mistress. Philip, at age 9, went away to boarding school. On holidays he was shunted around between relations—a person, he wrote in a guest book, “of no fixed abode.”</td>

He said it was “highly unlikely” that millions of people would gather at the National Mall as part of the festivities.<br />“I think you’re going to see something that is closer to what the convention was like than a typical inauguration,” he said.<br />Mr. Biden said his transition team was holding discussions with congressional leaders in preparations for the events planned on Jan. 20, when he is scheduled to be sworn-in as the nation’s 46th president. Public health officials have continued to warn against large gatherings as coronavirus cases have skyrocketed across the country.<br />“First and foremost, my objective is to keep America safe but still allow people to celebrate,“ Mr. Biden said. ”People want to celebrate.

      <td>The shifts and ambiguities in the novelist’s work resonate with a historian who has chronicled the shadowy forces of persecution.</td>
      <td>At the outset of this brief but haunting work, Saul Friedländer asks himself a question. Now 88, the eminent historian of the Holocaust wonders whether he felt the urge to reread Marcel Proust’s great multivolume novel “In Search of Lost Time” in response “to some need, to something in my personal life that called for delving into that book.” At the close, he will give us an answer. In the meantime, this lifelong student of the worst in human history and character finds relief from a dark vocation in the beauty and irony—and deep ambiguity—of an author he deems “the greatest painter in words in French literature.” This, though, is a shadowed portrait—and the shadows occasionally fall not only over Proust, but his champion as well.<br />Mr. Friedländer has always imbued his scholarship with an acute literary sensibility rooted in a multilingual, border-crossing background. Born in Prague to a nonreligious Jewish family, young Pavel moved to France when the Nazis invaded his Czech homeland. Separated from his parents (who would die in Auschwitz), he survived the war in occupied France as a pupil at a Catholic school but returned to his ancestral faith. Now an ardent Zionist, he left for Israel in 1948. There Pavel/Paul became Saul (reversing the path of his New Testament namesake). He worked for the future Israeli premier and president Shimon Peres, but turned sharply against the divisive nationalism of the Netanyahu era. As a historian, based in Geneva and then at UCLA, he integrated daily life and high policy into his panoramic study of the Third Reich as it descended from persecution to extermination.<br />In addition to the prize-winning volumes of his “Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1933-1945” he has written two luminous memoirs: “When Memory Comes” and “Where Memory Leads.” After a 2013 book on Franz Kafka’s shame and guilt, Mr. Friedländer confirms his late swerve toward literature in the incisive and quizzical essays of “Proustian Uncertainties.” Proust, the conflicted son of a doting Jewish mother and a distant Catholic father, speaks to the historian who mapped the shifting sands of identity in a period when tolerance and assimilation vied with bigotry and harassment.<br />He finds Proust “undecided to the end” about his Jewishness. The nameless narrator of “In Search of Lost Time”—who sometimes shares his creator’s views but often doesn’t—directs both warm sympathy and snobbish mockery toward Jewish characters. He even compares one inoffensive friend to a “hyena,” a spasm of disgust that reveals, for Mr. Friedländer, the “secret self-image” of Proust as a guilty parvenu. Behind this “constant seesaw” lie the bleeding wounds of the Dreyfus Affair, which tore France apart—and divides the novel’s characters—after the Jewish officer was wrongly convicted of treason in 1895.<br />Proust’s homosexuality, which called for perpetual wariness and discretion, also shifted and sharpened his angles of vision. His fiction, Mr. Friedländer shows, mounts an “eloquent defense of homosexuality,” courageous for its date. Still, it can descend into “the language of hatred,” even for the buffoonish but heroic Baron de Charlus—that unforgettable gay Falstaff. Proust shows us a lesbian couple engaged in a symbolic “act of desecration” of a father’s memory, an outrage justified by the narrator as an “escape” from unbearably mixed feelings. Proust’s uncertainties bred Proustian contradictions aplenty.</td>

For decades Turkey worked to build a society open to people of all faiths, and stood against Russian aggression. But a valuable ally has drifted.<br />The U.S. agreed to sell Turkey 100 F-35 jet fighters and include Turkish companies in manufacturing components of the aircraft. But three years ago, Ankara decided to purchase the Russian S-400 missile-defense system, designed to shoot down the F-35. Allowing Russian “advisers” to work near F-35s and giving the S-400 radar proximity to American stealth aircraft is unacceptable.<br />Diplomats, the Pentagon and senators, including us, warned Turkish government officials that there would be consequences. The president should now follow the law and levy sanctions against Turkish entities. The Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act requires sanctions against any country that engages in a “significant transaction” of defense assets with Russia, Iran or North Korea.<br />President Trump has demonstrated his commitment to putting American interests first. And the president has given Turkey every opportunity to cooperate with NATO. Congress, with broad bipartisan support, included enforcement language on Turkey in last year’s national defense authorization.<br />Punishing Turkey for choosing Russia over the U.S. would be a clear warning. Other nations should consider who is a better trade partner: the U.S., with more than 20% of the world’s economy, or Russia, with an economy smaller than the economies of some U.S. states.

Every year Nova Scotia donates one of its finest firs or spruces to serve as Boston’s official Christmas tree. The gifts come in gratitude for Boston’s help after the 1917 Halifax Explosion—the largest man-made blast of the preatomic age.<br />On the morning of Dec. 6, 1917, the SS Mont-Blanc entered Halifax’s harbor carrying thousands of tons of explosives en route from New York to France for use in World War I.

Good-bye boys.” Coleman died at his post; his warning saved as many as 300 lives.<br />The explosion sent up a mushroom cloud 2 miles high and shattered windows 50 miles away. It vaporized water, exposing the harbor floor. Samuel Prince, a survivor, described the devastation in a 1920 dissertation: “Trees were torn from the ground. Poles were snapped like toothpicks. Trains were stopped dead. Cars were left in twisted masses. Pedestrians were thrown violently into the air, houses collapsed on all sides. Streamers were slammed against the docks. Then followed a veritable air-raid, when the sky rained iron fragments upon the helpless city.”<br />Some 2,000 were killed and 9,000 wounded in a city of 50,000. Twelve thousand buildings were obliterated or badly damaged. Suddenly, half the city was homeless in the cold.</td>

      <td>Use of face coverings increased impressively right into the current national outbreak.</td>
      <td>It’s to be expected that many who spent four years unproductively obsessing about President Trump now believe his ambivalent mask messaging is responsible for every infection and death in the U.S. The mask issue is not nearly so simple.<br />Mask compliance has actually been pretty good around the U.S. and in Europe regardless of Donald Trump and it didn’t stop the current, worst-yet surge. In frustration, the CDC’s Robert Redfield insisted in midsummer that if everybody wore a mask for several weeks, the virus could be controlled. What he really might have liked to say: “It doesn’t matter how many of us wear masks if the young, who have the least to fear from Covid and are most likely to spread it unwittingly, aren’t wearing them.”<br />Until Nov. 10, his agency truthfully stressed that masks won’t save you from getting the disease, only from transmitting it. Now this guidance has been changed in apparent hope that the noncompliant might respond to a new message that doesn’t lean so heavily on their altruism. And yet a national survey from researchers at Harvard, Rutgers, Northeastern and Northwestern throws cold water on any idea of masks as a simple fix. Mask usage increased impressively across the U.S. right into the current outbreaks even as physical distancing fell by the wayside. “We find that social distancing has decreased dramatically since the spring, while mask wearing has increased,” the group concludes. At worst, our face-covering psychodrama distracted from the behavior that really matters.<br />Whether a Thanksgiving bump will materialize will be known in the next few days. Millions who defied guidance and traveled may have done so safely. France, Spain, Italy and Belgium have seen new infections turn down sharply in the past two weeks. The exception is Germany. Its leaders cite a “prevention paradox”—so successfully was an earlier surge moderated that people stopped fearing the virus. The U.S. may have created a similar problem for itself in spades with the national lockdown in the spring that landed like a lead balloon in parts of the country where the epidemic had not yet reached. We may still be paying for this “cry wolf” episode.<br />For what it’s worth, I see universal mask compliance and yet my state is enduring a surge right along with the others. I see virtue signaling on TV by anchors in a position to infect nobody but a camera. I see slippage below the nose which defeats the purpose of masking up. I see obstreperous old guys who recognize that a mask is a useful tool but get their backs up over people politicizing and fetishizing it.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers are currently negotiating details of a roughly $900 billion plan</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A sharp decline in job growth in November further prodded lawmakers to pursue an agreement on coronavirus relief, as negotiators hurried to craft a bill before a government funding deadline at the end of next week.<br />Fitful efforts to pass another aid package came back to life this week when a bipartisan group of rank-and-file lawmakers rolled out a $908 billion proposal, and top Democrats on Capitol Hill quickly said the plan should be the framework for negotiations going forward.<br />Several aid programs instituted in the spring expire at the end of year, squeezing lawmakers to pass more relief after months of failed negotiations.<br />Members of both parties pointed to Friday’s jobs report as further impetus for quick action. Employers added 245,000 jobs last month, less than half the 610,00 jobs added in October, and the unemployment rate dropped slightly to 6.7%. Many Americans are seeing temporary furloughs become permanent.<br />“We had some not-so-good news on the job front that further necessitates our taking action,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said at a news conference Friday.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—U.S. exports and imports both rose for a fifth straight month in October, reflecting a continued recovery in global commerce driven by a strong economic rebound in China.<br />Exports from the U.S. rose 2.2% to $182.0 billion from the previous month, while imports rose 2.1% to $245.1 billion, the Commerce Department said Friday. The trade deficit widened to $63.1 billion from $62.1 billion. The figures were adjusted for seasonal variations.<br />Global trade has recovered more quickly than economists expected since widespread lockdowns were imposed in March and April, but activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Economists say the outlook for trade remains uncertain amid a resurgence of the virus and renewed lockdowns in the U.S. and Europe.<br />“Virus transmissions remain elevated, and widening restrictions on activity, at home and abroad, have the potential to disrupt supply chains and weigh on demand,” Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics said in a research note.<br />Compared with a year earlier, U.S. exports in October were down 13.5%, while imports fell 3.3%.

      <td>Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Friday that although the latest job creation data is disappointing, he wasn’t yet ready to call for changes in central-bank monetary policy.<br />Instead, he said government aid, which can be targeted and deployed quickly, is the most effective way to deliver new support to the U.S. economy right now, and is more potent relative to what the Fed can do with its suite of tools.<br />The November data, which showed moderating levels of job creation, was “weaker than I was expecting,” Mr. Evans told reporters after remarks to a Michigan banking group. But even so, he said he doesn’t see a need for the Fed to alter its path in what remains a time of high uncertainty.<br />“The most important source of stimulus for the economy over the next few months is some type of fiscal support and increase in public health safety support,” Mr. Evans said. “I think that that would be quicker. I think that that’s most relevant at the moment” compared with actions the Federal Reserve could take.<br />In a separate appearance, Minneapolis Fed leader Neel Kashakari joined with Mr. Evans in expressing concern about the slow pace of job creation. The government said the jobless rate stood at 6.7% last month—it’s down from a shockingly high 14.7% in April—but many economists noted the drop in unemployment was actually driven by people leaving the labor force.</td>

      <td>Governments scramble to secure limited vaccine supplies, and only a small sliver of the population will receive a shot for months to come</td>
      <td>The race to vaccinate the world’s population against Covid-19 is shifting into a high stakes contest, as governments scramble to secure the small number of doses becoming available from Western pharmaceutical companies and Russia and China race to fill the gap.<br />The result is a fragmentary global vaccination drive likely to proceed at vastly different speeds. For most people around the world, a vaccine will remain a distant hope for several months, and it could be years before the poorest countries cover their people. Consequently, governments may need to deploy alternatives like widespread testing and smarter social distancing restrictions in order to contain the virus’s spread, global public health experts said.<br />“When we talk about the global vaccine race, there are still a lot more questions than answers,” said Syra Madad, a senior director at New York City’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. “I don’t think it’s going to be enough to get us out of the pandemic.… If the question is, is a vaccine an exit strategy? It’s part of an exit strategy.”<br />Europe and America have struck dozens of different, competing bilateral contracts with drug makers, but initial supplies will be limited, forcing hard choices through at least the first quarter of next year.<br />This week, the U.K.’s authorization of the West’s first vaccine offered hope that other leading Western candidates could soon cross the finish line. But the front-running candidates use novel viral RNA technology that is hard to scale up. Whether and how soon the U.S. and EU can inoculate the majority of their populations will partly depend on whether other vaccines—which use more traditional platforms—prove safe and effective.</td>

      <td>If there were ever a year to ship our loved ones cookie tins brimming with cheer, this is it. With these top techniques from pro bakers, festive treats arrive fresh, intact and full of sparkle.</td>
      <td>THIS SEASON, many of us are scaling back our holiday celebrations. But even if you can’t gather with everyone you love, you can still feed them. Spread holiday cheer—remotely—by baking and mailing packages of comforting cookies.<br />Sharing cookies is a longstanding holiday ritual. This time of year, kitchens turn into production facilities to supply cookie swaps, tree-trimming parties and holiday open houses. Even in normal times, some of those cookies would travel by mail. But in 2020, shipping cookies takes on new resonance. “I don’t know of a better gift than to bake for someone,” said Kelly Fields, author of “The Good Book of Southern Baking” (Lorena Jones Books) and owner of Willa Jean restaurant in New Orleans. “Baking is my love language.”<br />First, you need to choose your cookies. Ms. Fields ships baked goods from Willa Jean nationwide via the mail-order-food site Goldbelly. She recommends sticking with sturdy varieties for shipping—drop cookies, shortbreads, biscotti. Stay away from iced or filled cookies, or any that are brittle or tender. “I love pecan sandies enough that if somebody was to ship them to me, I would enjoy the crumbs as much as the cookie,” said Ms. Fields. “But not everybody is of that opinion.”<br />Picking durable cookies is a good excuse to forgo fussiness altogether. Put away the frosting tubes, rolling pins and cookie cutters, and let lower-maintenance flourishes—powdered sugar, sprinkles, sanding sugar—do the dazzling. “If I did the thing where I made cutout cookies with the sugars and royal icing decorations and piping bags, then you have to wait for them to dry,” said Claire Saffitz, author of “Dessert Person” (Clarkson Potter). “I don’t have time to do that anymore. I like cookies that don’t require decoration and look pretty on their own.” Her slice-and-bake pistachio pinwheels, with their hypnotic, swirly green pattern, are both stunning and surprisingly simple to make.<br />While some bakers feel compelled to churn out a smorgasbord, it’s OK to stick with one variety. “There are people who would be super pumped to get a dozen chocolate chip cookies, and equally excited to get a dozen of three or four different kinds,” said Ms. Fields. “Whatever you’re going to have the most fun with is the right number.”</td>

      <td>Trump lost badly in New York and California, but Republican candidates picked up House seats in both states. Here’s how two of them did it.</td>
      <td>A quarter-century apart in age, Nicole Malliotakis and Michelle Steel are classmates. They’re both freshmen, Republicans who’ve won election to the House of Representatives for the first time. Each ousted an incumbent Democrat in a resolutely blue state—New York and California, respectively—where Joe Biden romped home in November. And each woman has a scathing view of the politics of the other’s state as well as of her own. They’re ready to scorn Govs. Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom. As for Mayor Bill de Blasio, Ms. Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman from New York City, practically combusts at the mention of his name.<br />“I think our leaderships are competing with each other to be the most radical. They keep getting bad ideas from each other,” says Ms. Malliotakis, 40, who will represent New York’s 11th Congressional District, comprised of the borough of Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn.<br />“The leadership is trying to make these states into Third World countries,” Ms. Steel, 65, responds. She is a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, a local legislative body, and representative-elect from California’s 48th District, a beachy slice of the county. In Washington for a freshman orientation, including a lottery for office space, the two talk to me by Zoom from their hotel rooms near the Capitol.<br />Both are robust proponents of low taxes and limited government. “Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Ms. Malliotakis says: “The government should provide an environment for that—and then get out of the way.” Ms. Steel—who was born in South Korea and came to the U.S. at 19—confesses to drawing her earliest political beliefs from her mother’s experience as a clothing-store owner in Los Angeles. “I saw that my mom was harassed—really harassed—by a tax agency, the State Board of Equalization,” she says. “And you know what? I decided that the Republican Party’s ideology is much better for small-business owners. They need less regulation and smaller taxes.” Her first foray into elective politics was a successful run for the Board of Equalization in 2007.<br />Not long into our conversation, however, a difference emerges. Asked what role President Trump played in her race, Ms. Steel says that he was “not really a factor.” Hers was a very local race: “For an 18-month period, it was just Rouda vs. Steel.” (Rep. Harley Rouda won election in 2018, unseating 15-term Republican Dana Rohrabacher.) The voters in her district, she says, “were more concerned about their businesses”—hit hard by the pandemic—and with state and local taxes.</td>

      <td>‘12 Sunsets,’ his new interactive digital archive, includes 65,000 images covering all 22 miles of Sunset Boulevard</td>
      <td>When Ed Ruscha began photographing the streets of Los Angeles decades ago, strangers would ask what he was doing, squinting behind the lens of a retrofitted Nikon on a tripod in the flatbed of his Datsun pickup truck. “I just said, ‘Ahhh, this is a school project.’ Or something like that,” Mr. Ruscha recalls.<br />For more than 50 years, the artist has meticulously documented a number of streets, including Sunset Boulevard, which runs 22 miles from downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean. Now some 65,000 of his photographs of the street have been digitized and collected in “12 Sunsets,” an online archive launched recently by the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. Capturing Sunset Boulevard year in and year out “became an obsession,” Mr. Ruscha said, “because it’s such a Rolling Thunder of a street!”<br />Mr. Ruscha, who turns 83 this month, mixes Pop art, conceptual art and surrealism in a varied oeuvre infused with deadpan wit. “I kind of bounce around between making paintings and things that are not paintings, or drawings,” he said. “And I make prints, lithographs, etchings—things like that.”<br />The seeds of “12 Sunsets” were planted in 2012, when the Getty acquired an archive of about 500,000 images of Los Angeles streets by Mr. Ruscha. Over the years, he stored many strips of negatives by winding them around motion-picture reels. “We got these giant film canisters, as if we’d gotten 10 copies of ‘Lawrence of Arabia,’” said Andrew Perchuk, deputy director of the Getty Research Institute.<br />The images are a trove for demographers, urban planners and architectural historians: “There is no other such fine-grained record of an American city that anybody knows of,” Mr. Perchuk said. Visitors to the site can tool virtually along Sunset in either direction, east or west, and see how restaurants, karate schools and tuxedo-rental centers flourished and vanished. A stretch of the boulevard in West Hollywood known as the Sunset Strip was a longtime center of the music business, whose presence comes through in stores such as Organ Center and Guitars ‘R’ Us, the offices of music publishers and a sprawling Tower Records.</td>

      <td>Maria Garcia applied for aid and was denied simply because she doesn’t ‘identify as Black.’</td>
      <td>Portland, Ore.<br />The state of Oregon, hoping to strike a blow against both the pandemic and “systemic racism,” has established a Covid relief fund exclusively for blacks and black-owned businesses. The Oregon Cares Fund website accurately describes the program as “unprecedented.” It is also surely unconstitutional.<br />In July the Oregon Legislature Emergency Board allotted $200 million to assist small businesses suffering losses because of the pandemic and government-ordered shutdowns. Of the total, $62 million was set aside for the Oregon Cares Fund, whose website describes it as “a Fund for Black people, Black-owned businesses, and Black community based organizations.” Black families are eligible for up to $3,000 and black-owned businesses for up to $100,000.<br />Maria Garcia, owner of the Revolucion Coffee House in Portland, applied for support. She was denied because her business “does not meet the criteria because 0% of its owners identify as Black.” She has sued in federal court, alleging that the denial violates her rights under the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Last month a federal court declined a petition in another lawsuit, by the timber company Great Northern Resources, to enjoin further distributions from the Cares Fund. Both cases await a ruling on the constitutional merits.<br />The state couldn’t have been surprised at the challenges. Oregon’s Legislative Counsel advised the Emergency Board that, absent evidentiary findings of past discrimination by the state in the relevant industries, “the program would almost certainly be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.” But in a brief submitted to the Legislature, the Portland law firm Schwabe, Williamson & Wyatt gave the board cover with this now familiar refrain: “Centuries of systemic and institutional discrimination—perpetuated and exacerbated by current systems—have caused economic disparities.”</td>

      <td>LONDON—Ivan Glasenberg, the longtime chief executive of  Glencore  PLC, is handing over the reins of the global mining and trading giant he built, saying Friday he would retire in the first half of next year.<br />The Switzerland-based, London-listed company said it had tapped Gary Nagle, a senior deputy who currently runs the company’s coal industrial assets, for the top job.<br />A successor to one-time-fugitive Marc Rich at the company that would become Glencore, Mr. Glasenberg transformed it from a privately held trading house into the largest coal marketer in the world. An unapologetic promoter of coal, he continued to ramp up that business despite a growing backlash from governments, regulators and eventually investors, who criticized the fossil fuel for contributing to climate change.<br />In the past few years, however, Mr. Glasenberg began to shift away from a focus on coal, emphasizing Glencore’s big position in commodities key to building electric cars and renewable energy infrastructure, like nickel, copper and cobalt. The announcement of Mr. Glasenberg’s retirement came on a day when the company also said it planned to reduce its emissions to net zero by 2050. That will partly be possible, the company said, because of its depleting reserves of coal.<br />Mr. Glasenberg said he is handing off a company better positioned than others to take advantage of this energy shift. “No one has a portfolio of this mix to meet the energy demands of the future,” he told reporters Friday.</td>

      <td>The pandemic is accelerating a shift in the labor market to warehouse and delivery jobs supporting ecommerce</td>
      <td>Your shopping habits during the pandemic are reshaping America’s labor market.<br />The nation added jobs for the seventh straight month in November, the Labor Department said Friday. Most came in the transportation and warehousing industries—the ones that package, ship and deliver goods to consumers. Households’ shift toward buying sneakers, groceries and even cars online is driving a hiring binge in logistics industries.<br />Warehousing and transportation accounted for 145,000 of the 245,000 jobs created in November—and a big share of job growth since the labor market began recovering this spring after a sharp contraction due to the coronavirus pandemic. Online retailer  Amazon.com Inc.  has announced plans to hire hundreds of thousands of workers this year, including warehouse and seasonal employees.<br />The shift is creating a divide in the workplace. U.S. employment is still 6.5% smaller than it was in February, the month before the pandemic caused businesses across the U.S. to close. But employment in warehousing and related industries has boomed. Warehousing and storage jobs have grown by 97,000, or 8%, since February. Courier and messenger jobs—workers who deliver goods—have expanded by 182,000, or 22%.<br />Much of the growth is tied to consumer spending. Even before the pandemic, U.S. households were increasingly buying retail items online, including clothing, gifts and groceries. The pandemic has accelerated that trend. Now, increasingly consumers are even buying cars online, instead of going to the showroom.</td>

      <td>Standing for centuries in the Piazza della Signoria in the sun, rain and snow was giving Michelangelo’s David a skin condition, so in 1873 Florentines transplanted the marble statue to the protective rotunda of the nearby Galleria dell’Accademia, to be bathed in the illumination of a domed skylight. Other outdoor Florentine art treasures have since followed suit, most recently the pair of gilded bronze doors commissioned by one of the city’s merchant guilds and designed by Andrea Pisano in 1330 for the Baptistery of Florence’s cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. A year ago this month, after three years of painstaking restoration, a blink in Florentine time, the doors—the oldest of three pairs done for the Baptistery—were installed in a purpose-built hall inside the church’s art and sculpture museum, the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo. Replicas replaced the originals.<br />Andrea’s doors joined the famous Gates of Paradise and another set, both by Lorenzo Ghiberti (1378-1455). All had weathered centuries of pollution, not to mention the devastating flood of 1966. They now stand together under protective glass in the museum’s luminous main hall, the gold leaf once obscured by grime now flickering in the light.<br />Of all the great artworks Italy has produced, the Baptistery’s doors, their sculpted reliefs illustrating biblical narratives, are among the most sacred, and not just because they belong to a major Italian cathedral. The triumvirate, created between 1329 and 1452, spans a critical period that saw the so-called proto-Renaissance of the late Middle Ages flower into the High Renaissance. Andrea sculpted his doors during Giotto’s lifetime; Ghiberti completed the Gates of Paradise the year Leonardo da Vinci was born. The trio forms a historical cycle.<br />Andrea modeled his doors on the monumental San Ranieri bronze gates finished in 1186 by Bonanno Pisano (no relation) for the Cathedral of Pisa, which featured 10 rectangular reliefs depicting scenes from the life of Christ within a decorative architectural grid that unified the whole. Andrea’s set has 28 narrative reliefs within an architectural grid, eight depicting the Virtues (placed in two rows at the bottom); the remaining 20 scenes are from the life of St. John the Baptist, patron saint of Florence, to whom the Baptistery was dedicated.<br />Unlike in Pisa, where bronze plates were attached to wooden frames, the Baptistery doors were entirely cast in bronze, and within each rectangle the scene is set within a medieval quatrefoil. In all but five, the action takes place on a projecting shelf or platform.</td>

      <td>Situation has already gotten worse since the November jobs report was compiled</td>
      <td>The job market is in danger of stalling. With the Covid epidemic worsening across the country, that should hardly count as a surprise, but perhaps it will stir both Congress and the Federal Reserve to move faster than they otherwise might have.<br />The Labor Department on Friday reported that the economy added 245,000 jobs in November, short of the 440,000 economists expected and far weaker than October’s gain of 610,000. That left the U.S. with 9.8 million fewer jobs than in February, before the crisis took hold. The unemployment rate slipped to 6.7% from 6.9%, but that was because fewer people were looking for work—a reflection of people throwing in the towel on finding a job, or taking themselves out of the labor force to care for homebound children.<br />If anything, the current state of affairs is worse than what was depicted in the job report. The surveys that the jobs and unemployment figures are based upon measured the state of things in the pay periods included in the week ended Nov. 14.  Since then, Covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths have risen, spurring renewed caution on the part of many Americans, while colder weather is hurting businesses that have been relying on outdoor arrangements, such as restaurants. This chill is showing up in higher-frequency data: Restaurant reservation figures from OpenTable show a marked decline since early November, for example, while figures from scheduling-software company Homebase show that the number of hourly employees working at restaurants, retailers and other small businesses is slipping.<br />For investors the silver lining is that the job figures could help push another round of government support over the finish line. With a bipartisan group from the House and Senate reaching a broad consensus around a new $908 billion aid package, the possibility of Congress passing a deal before it breaks for the holidays is looking more likely.<br />Fed officials, too, might be more inclined to step up their efforts to support the economy when they meet later this month. That could include committing to continue the central bank’s purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities until certain economic conditions are met. It might also tilt Treasury purchases more to longer-dated securities in an effort to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates.</td>

      <td>Out on the water or down in the pub, Cornish fishermen hold on to an ancient way of life.</td>
      <td>In the spring of 2017, Lamorna Ash, then a 22-year-old graduate student in anthropology at University College London, rode British Rail from Paddington Station all the way down the “Cornish Riviera” to Penzance, the last stop on the Great Western line. Her plan was to immerse herself in the life of Newlyn, a small fishing village just beyond Penzance on the coastal road toward Land’s End, in order to do field research for her master’s thesis on the culture of a tight-knit community whose work has centered around a single industry—fishing—for centuries. Ms. Ash, named for a nearby coastal landmark—Lamorna Cove—was drawn to Cornwall by her family’s history there, including her mother’s childhood home and subsequent family holidays.<br />Ms. Ash successfully completed her master’s degree—and then some. “Dark, Salt, Clear” is an extraordinary debut, a deeply researched and deeply felt work of narrative nonfiction. It is the kind of book that ziplines readers to a different world. You’ll feel the damp sea air and smell the fish and ale in this vivid, multifaceted portrait of a hardworking, hard-drinking town and its salty residents, intimately connected to one another and to every aspect of its sea-to-market fishing industry. Ms. Ash explores questions about work, life and community and in so doing reflects on her own choices. On top of everything else, this book charts the author’s own passage to maturity as she re-evaluates what matters to her.<br />Although set along a stretch of the same spectacular, craggy coastline as “The Salt Path” (2018), Raynor Winn’s memoir about hiking the entire 630-mile Southwest Coast Path with her ailing husband following bankruptcy and a dire medical diagnosis, “Dark, Salt, Clear” is a deep dive into a distinctive culture rather than a tale of confronting adversity with a literal walk on the wild side. Over the course of two separate stays, first in spring and later in fall, Ms. Ash lodges with a local couple—Denise, a fishmonger, and Lofty, a ship’s chandler—in their cottage overlooking the harbor in Newlyn’s fisherman’s quarter, known as the Fradgan. “I don’t think I really knew what community meant before staying with Denise and Lofty,” she writes. “Because those who live in the village also work in the village and socialize here too, there is a depth to their relationships virtually unheard of in sprawling cities.”<br />Her well-connected hosts introduce her to fellow old-timers, including a police sergeant/birdwatcher with a blog called “Ornitholosism II—It’s a Religion!” who teaches her about the local avian culture. A retired geologist gives her a crash tutorial on the long history of the region’s geography and geology, evidenced in the largely untampered coastline, whose “bald cliffs act like time exposed, their many layers—some with lines of dark orange copper running through them—recounting the story of the county’s ancient past.”<br />Ms. Ash explores Newlyn’s drinking culture firsthand, with rowdy nights at the Swordy and the Star, two pubs frequented by local fishermen. There is much talk about the challenges of fishing quotas, climate change, repeated absences from family and the economic stresses of gentrification as the area becomes ever more popular with tourists and second-home buyers. Although Newlyn is one of the largest and most profitable fishing ports in the U.K., salaries are low, with the average wage 17% below the rest of the country’s. In fact, Ms. Ash reports that Cornwall suffers from high rates of homelessness and had the third highest suicide rate in the U.K. in 2017. Yet despite living in the only U.K. county poor enough to qualify for emergency funding from the European Union, local fishermen, frustrated with the encroachment of EU vessels on local fishing grounds, largely voted for Brexit.</td>

      <td>From ‘Rent’ to ‘The Producers,’ the 1990s proved a decade of stage hits from unexpected sources.</td>
      <td>It’s a bittersweet experience to pick up Michael Riedel’s fun and gossipy new showbiz history, “Singular Sensation: The Triumph of Broadway.” Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the “Triumph” of its title would have been arguable: While Broadway was thriving this time last year, the business suffered from systemic problems that had never really been addressed, such as bloated ticket prices and venal scalpers. In the wake of Covid-19, Broadway’s future is highly uncertain. When will theaters reopen? Will tourists and New York theatergoers actually want to cram themselves into those crowded houses? Will 2019 ticket prices hold in the post-Covid economy? If not, will theater owners, producers and unions agree to temper their greed?<br />It seems to me, then, that “Singular Sensation,” which examines Broadway through the 1990s, gives a brief summary of the 2000s and concludes with the statement that “Broadway is in the midst of its new Golden Age,” is already passé even at the moment of publication. Still, it makes for a jolly read. It’s a follow-up to Mr. Riedel’s successful “Razzle Dazzle: The Battle for Broadway” (2015),  which provided an insider’s look at 1970s and ’80s Broadway, primarily through the perspective of the powerful Shubert Organization. By the late ’60s, the rise of rock music had made the Broadway musical seem obsolete: “An art form that once produced the greatest of American songwriters no longer attracted them.” “Razzle Dazzle” took readers from this crisis point, which coincided with white flight from the city and the encroaching sleaze of Times Square, to Broadway’s reassertion of its unique identity—beginning with the musical “A Chorus Line” (1975), which almost singlehandedly revived the genre. Mr. Riedel ended that volume in the 1990s with the death of Bernard B. Jacobs, who with Gerald Schoenfeld, had helmed the Shubert Organization—the duo known to insiders as Bernie and Jerry, or simply, “the Shuberts.”<br />The revitalization of Broadway went hand-in-hand with the post-rock reinvention of the musical (Mr. Riedel gives only minimal space to straight plays), with hits like “Annie,” “42nd Street,” “Dreamgirls,” and “Nine” following “A Chorus Line.” And starting with 1970’s “Company,” Stephen Sondheim had shown the way to expanded psychological possibilities for the genre. But theatrical geniuses were, as ever, rare, and the deaths of Michael Bennett, Bob Fosse and Gower Champion within just a few years of each other, along with Jerome Robbins’s decision to devote all his time to the New York City Ballet, left Broadway bereft of great director-choreographers. “And who’s in sight to take their places?” Bernie Jacobs inquired piteously. The answer was already on the horizon. “The dance-driven American musical was about to give way to the British pop opera.” The age of Andrew Lloyd Webber had begun.<br />Without the focal point of the Shuberts, “Singular Sensation” lacks the unity and through-story of “Razzle Dazzle,” but it excels in giving the reader a fly-on-the-wall view of backstage infighting, struggles, and victories. As a longtime theater columnist, first for the New York Daily News and then for the New York Post, Mr. Riedel can spin a yarn with zest. Creating, rehearsing and mounting even a mediocre Broadway musical is an epic process, more difficult than outsiders can imagine, and Mr. Riedel presents some of these stories in gruesome detail. “Sunset Boulevard,” for example, shows many of its key players at their worst. Mr. Lloyd Webber comes off as extremely hubristic: Reflecting on the brilliant Billy Wilder movie he would base his musical on, he decided to take the plot to greater extremes. “We went much further than the film,” he said smugly. Part of the problem, no? Then, having hired Patti LuPone for the role of Norma Desmond in London, he didn’t have the nerve to tell her he was casting Glenn Close for the American productions. Hell, as we know, hath no fury like a diva scorned, and “the feud between Patti LuPone and Andrew Lloyd Webber gripped the theater world for years to come.” (That sentence alone constitutes proof of just how provincial and hermetic the theater world is.)<br />Mr. Riedel devotes a couple of moving chapters to the saga of “Rent,” the brainchild of a passionate young writer-composer named Jonathan Larson, who wrote the show while working as a waiter at the Moondance Diner on Sixth Avenue, developed it painstakingly at the off-Broadway New York Theatre Workshop, then died of an aortic dissection, at 35, just before the show’s triumphant first preview.</td>

      <td>Selected by the author of the Constable Twitten mystery series.</td>
      <td>By Patrick Hamilton (1941)<br />1. “To those whom God has forsaken is given a gas-fire in Earl’s Court.” So writes the British Patrick Hamilton, in this, his masterpiece, “Hangover Square.” In 1956 the poet John Betjeman described Hamilton as a writer of “the top class of English novels” while admitting that he knew nothing whatever about him. Hamilton was an outsider and so were his subjects—people whose idea of life was to make it from one pub to the next. In this tense and brilliant novel set in the late 1930s, we meet the unforgettable George Harvey Bone—a huge, unhappy shambles of a man tossed from one vivid mental state to another by excesses of booze. He’s besotted with the equally unforgettable Netta Longdon, whom he’s nonetheless driven to kill. The novel strongly suggests a reason: “The girl wore her attractiveness not as a girl should . . . but rather as a murderous utensil with which she might wound indiscriminately.” There is no missing the novel’s artfully achieved echo of history—particularly the efforts to appease Nazi Germany prior to World War II. Netta may not be a Nazi, but there’s something pointedly familiar, by design, about the way George is subjected to ever-increasing depths of humiliation by the selfish Netta. Until he acts.<br />By Muriel Spark (1970)<br />2. In the year she published “The Driver’s Seat,” Muriel Spark wrote, “I advocate the arts of satire and of ridicule.” As if to prove it, she wrote this absorbing novella, described by the novelist David Lodge as “a crime story turned inside out.” It is a masterpiece of inversion, one that takes the elements of a normal crime story—a woman’s body found—and reverses them all. Victim Lise, who flies to a southern European city seemingly in search of her murderer, wears garish clothes, creates a trail of incidents and makes odd, Samuel Beckett-type comments as if to provide the material for witness statements. “You’re not my type,” she tells the pushy men who try to pair off with her—which, we learn, is code for “You’re not my murderer.” Finally, she meets her “type” and the grisly crime—her killing—occurs, under her detailed instruction. Doctoral dissertations have been written on this short novel, which was intended to satirize the style of the then-fashionable French nouveau roman. But the question Spark artfully raises in it is a timeless one: Who is in the driver’s seat in this (or any) book?<br />By Jill Dawson (2000)</td>

      <td>Reading Shirley Hazzard’s fiction and essays is a bracing confrontation with a fearless mind.</td>
      <td>Just as excellence can, in certain moods, strike us as a reproach, Shirley Hazzard has a way of unnerving the unready. For Hazzard, who died in 2016 at the age of 85, writing was a toweringly moral enterprise whose central drama is played out continuously on the level of the sentence. The sloppy construction, the cant phrase, the parroted opinion—these represent unforgivable derelictions of duty. In a 1982 essay lamenting what she viewed as a rise in corporatism and groupthink, Hazzard wrote: “There is at least one immense truth we can still adhere to and make central to our lives—responsibility to the accurate word.” Reading her lucid, witty, attentive and fearlessly candid books one is uncomfortably reminded of Thoreau’s admonition that “there is never an instant’s truce between virtue and vice.”<br />These rigorous standards were not divisible from Hazzard’s life, which was organized around art and ideas. A passionate autodidact, Hazzard grew up in Australia but resided for most of her life in New York and Italy. With her husband, the great Flaubert biographer Francis Steegmuller (whom she met at a party thrown by Muriel Spark), she discreetly occupied the hub of the postwar intellectual world. Impeccably finished novels appeared at tasteful intervals, notably “The Bay of Noon,” in 1970, “The Transit of Venus,” in 1980, and “The Great Fire,” for which she received the 2003 National Book Award and came to the belated notice of a generation of readers accustomed to more from their authors in the way of self-promotion.<br />Less known than these books, but certainly no less accomplished, is Hazzard’s short fiction, nearly all of which appeared in the New Yorker, and which has now been brought together by editor Brigitta Olubas in the volume “Collected Stories” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 356 pages, $28). Along with a handful of uncollected and previously unpublished stories are the contents of her 1963 debut, “Cliffs of Fall,” and the linked sketches satirizing the United Nations in “People in Glass Houses,” from 1967.<br />“Cliffs of Fall” is concerned with love triangles of different angles and ratios. Hazzard is as interested in true heartache as in comedic infatuation, and the layering of sentiment and irony produces a complex choral effect. “You learned—it was all understood—that you must not forfeit any advantage, and that love itself was a subtle game of stoutly maintaining or judiciously yielding your position,” one character thinks, wryly pondering the embittered state of her marriage. Men usually hold the levers of power by dint of the self-righteousness that is expected from their gender, but women can master the game as well. “It is really quite easy to have the advantage over people,” one realizes. “You just have to keep quiet and look at them.”<br />Cynicism occasions Hazzard’s most memorable aphorisms, but her allegiances ultimately lie not with the wised-up but the vulnerable and devoted. Abandonment to love is akin, in these stories, to submission to an eternal work of art. The beauty and pathos derived from the surrender belong to a higher order of experience. When a married man ending things with his mistress tells her how much he owes her, the placating comment creates a moment of revelatory abjection. “This admission seemed to her to set the seal on the dissolution of their love: total indebtedness could only be acknowledged where no attempt at repayment was contemplated.”</td>

      <td>Six new books to help make at-home holidays bright.</td>
      <td>Why is this holiday season different from any other holiday season? Unfortunately, we all know the answer to that. Instead of socializing and traveling in the run-up to Hanukkah and Christmas, most of us will be in sedentary seclusion. Fortunately, some things don’t have to change. Families can still fry latkes and light menorahs, or set up creches and build gingerbread houses (or do all these things), and in the evening children can still snuggle up with festive picture books.<br />For Jewish households, Leslie Kimmelman presents an affectionate Judeo-medieval mash-up in “The Eight Knights of Hanukkah” (Holiday House, 40 pages, $17.99), a picture book about deeds of “awesome kindness and stupendous bravery.” As we see in Galia Bernstein’s droll cartoon illustrations, on the last day of Hanukkah a dastardly dragon is plaguing a kingdom, gobbling all the doughnuts, swooping over orchards and roasting the unpicked apples, and scorching the Hebrew letters off children’s dreidels. A cohort of mail-clad champions, at the behest of their mother, sets out on horseback to put the kingdom in order. Alone and severally, the knights perform goodly fixes: Sir Gabriel, for example, valiantly peels a massive pile of spuds (the usual potato-peelers having fled for fear of the dragon); his apron reads, “Kisseth the cook.” If the ending feels a little pat, well, never mind: Who wouldn’t want a dragon to light the Hanukkah candles?<br />Two admired figures in the world of children’s literature have combined forces for a joyfully syncretic picture book about a roving spirit of seasonal plenty, Nate Gadol, whose surname means “great” in Hebrew. Written by Arthur A. Levine and illustrated by Kevin Hawkes, “The Hanukkah Magic of Nate Gadol” (Candlewick, 30 pages, $19.99) is as much a celebration of the American melting pot as it is the story of a specific character. And what a character! In his bright blue greatcoat and ornate boots (see below), Nate Gadol travels unseen across continents and through centuries: “In answer to people’s prayers, he made things last as long as they needed to.”<br />Evidently Nate was in Judea with the Maccabees more than 2,000 years ago, ensuring that their tiny reserve of oil burned for eight days and nights—the original Hanukkah miracle. And he’s active in the American winter of 1881, when two impoverished immigrant families, the Jewish Glasers and the Catholic O’Malleys, are in need of help. Mr. Hawkes’s pictures for this inviting tale have sweep and warmth, with rich coloring and touches of gold that give even scenes of chilly privation a sumptuous appearance. In an afterword, Mr. Levine writes of his desire to expand the “wonderful supplementary mythology” of stories connected with the celebrations of Christmas and Hanukkah. It is an ambition achieved in this delightful book for readers ages 4-9.<br />For another tale of Yuletide generosity, Tad Hills uses colors so glowing that it’s as though the pages are strung with Christmas-tree lights. “Mistletoe” (Schwartz & Wade, 32 pages, $17.99) features an eponymous gray mouse who can’t seem to induce her great friend, Norwell, to come outside into the cold to enjoy the snow. Norwell, an elephant, demurs: “I think I’ll stay home, where it’s cozy.” When Mistletoe realizes why Norwell is so reluctant, she gets busy with knitting needles and yarn. As Christmas approaches, she knits at every possible moment, even “in the bath (which isn’t easy).” A humorous reveal at the end shows how far friendship—and yarn— can extend in this picture book for children ages 2-6.</td>

      <td>A holiday feast of cozy mayhem from Agatha Christie, John Banville and Anne Perry.</td>
      <td>‘Christmas was the supreme Festival, something never to be forgotten,” Agatha Christie recalls in an autobiographical bit appended to “Midwinter Murder” (Morrow, 305 pages, $16.99), a new gathering of Christie’s holiday-themed short stories. “Christmas stockings in bed. Breakfast, when everyone had a separate chair heaped with presents.  . . . A splendid day, and one to be remembered till next year, when Christmas came again.”<br />Little wonder that so many of the tales in this stocking-stuffer have light touches and reassuring endings. In “Christmas Adventure,” one of four stories here featuring Dame Agatha’s best-known sleuth, Hercule Poirot, a group of charming youngsters witness the detective solve a crime less homicidal than it appears. “The Chocolate Box,” a tranquil fireside tale, finds Poirot recalling his single professional failure—which isn’t that much of a failure after all. And in “The Mystery of Hunter’s Lodge,” Poirot, sidelined by flu, sends his friend Hastings to investigate—thus giving himself the pleasure of solving the case from his sickbed.<br />Most of this collection’s entries feature other familiar Christie protagonists. There are breezy puzzles involving the married duo of Tommy and Tuppence, and a case for the sophisticated Mr. Parker Pyne. In two stories with Miss Jane Marple, the village lady who sees all and tells much, we are reminded how Christie could, when necessary, project an almost hard-boiled sensibility. “[He] was hanged,” Miss Marple recounts of the murderous villain in “A Christmas Tragedy.” “And a good job too. I have never regretted my part in bringing that man to justice. I’ve no patience with modern humanitarian scruples about capital punishment.”<br />“The body is in the library. Come this way,” invites one Col. Osborne at the start of John Banville’s dour novel “Snow” (Hanover Square, 299 pages, $27.99), set at Christmastime in an Irish manor house in 1957. At first glimpse, it may seem the lord of the manse is ushering readers into a traditional cozy holiday mystery. “Will you look at this place?” wheezes a police forensics man as he enters chilly old Ballyglass House. “Next thing Poirot himself will appear on the scene.”<br />But the Booker Prize-winning Mr. Banville has a different sort of story in mind. “It was only in the politer detective novels,” police inspector St. John (“It’s pronounced Sinjun”) Strafford muses, “that the victim ended up on the library floor without first having passed, albeit briefly, through a living hell of agony and anguish.” As it was for the victim here: a Catholic priest (supposedly beloved throughout the district) who’s been stabbed on the staircase, heinously mutilated, and left to die on the carpet. “That was a nice Yuletide present for you to stumble on,” Strafford’s boss teases.</td>

      <td>Ernest Cline returns to a virtually puzzling future with ‘Ready Player Two.’</td>
      <td>At the end of Ernest Cline’s 2011 novel “Ready Player One,” his teenage hero Wade Watts—or, rather, Wade’s digital avatar, Parzival—had found the hidden egg, solved the riddle, fulfilled his quest, and accordingly become the omnipotent master of Oasis, the virtual universe in which the human race spends most of its time. He simultaneously became the richest person on Earth in real-life, and moreover he found love.<br />Great ending, but how to follow that? (No pressure, Mr. Cline.) “Ready Player Two” (Ballantine, 384 pages, $28.99) starts off with the obvious answer. There was another egg hidden in Oasis by its creator James Halliday, the uber-geek who bequeathed all his rights to whoever should find his egg and solve his riddle. Now the game is on again.<br />Why, however, should Wade/Parzival bother to play it, since he has pretty much everything already? The late Halliday, through his own avatar, Anorak, means to use the stick rather than the carrot. If the quest is not fulfilled, the consequences will be disastrous, and for the whole of humanity.<br />“Ready Player Two” brings out the dangers lurking in the whole schema of its predecessor (made into a Steven Spielberg film in 2018). OK, virtual reality, taken to a higher power, is insidiously attractive. But while its users may be roaming a fantasy universe in their heads, their bodies are still slumped in a basement, unwashed and starving. And if that’s how it is, what kind of future has humanity got?<br />The same question applies in a different way to Wade and his geek friends. They boast of living in the future, but their trademark is total recall of the past. They use their money to recreate Tolkien’s Rivendell, or build replica cars from “Back to the Future” or “Buckaroo Banzai.” In fact, just whisper it, they really want to be back in high school again. Only not as nerds.</td>

      <td>A fiery crash scares Americans a lot more than an invisible virus, but it shouldn’t.<br />In a public relations exercise to reassure the public about flying on the Boeing 737 MAX when it is reintroduced in a few weeks,  American Airlines  has begun offering employees flights that take off and land at the same airport. The odds of them dying in a crash were infinitesimal even before the model’s safety overhaul. Their chances of catching Covid, and even dying from it, are higher.<br />Late last year a survey by  Bank of America  found that almost two-thirds of Americans would wait at least six months to fly on the plane after it is reintroduced. That is a higher proportion than those in a Franklin Templeton-Gallup survey who felt unsafe flying because of Covid-19 this summer.<br />Yet on Thursday alone the U.S. death toll from Covid-19 was the equivalent of 16 fully loaded 737 MAX jets. Deaths in just one-and-a-half hours were the same as total U.S. air fatalities since 2002.<br />A study by MIT Sloan professor Arnold Barnett showed that the odds of catching Covid on a short-haul flight if the middle seat is vacant are 1 in 7,700. If passengers feel comfortable with that then it really doesn’t matter what jetliner they are on.</td>

The move highlights a global shift away from fossil fuels as countries and companies seek to reduce carbon emissions with the aim of limiting global warming.<br />Several major economies including Germany, the U.K., and France have recently signed into law targets to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, with China and other Asian countries making similar pledges.<br />Meanwhile, energy giants including  BP  PLC and  Total SE  have signaled their intention to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and invest more in renewable energy like wind and solar power.</td>

Mr. Trump, he said, “is happy to provide assistance” in “key, targeted areas” such as the small-business Paycheck Protection Program, unemployment insurance, and measures to keep schools open.<br />While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has shown a willingness to accept a smaller aid package than before, Mr. Kudlow said, adding that some policy differences remain between the two sides. Trump administration officials remain in discussions with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.).<br />“Talk is good,” Mr. Kudlow said. “We may be moving forward, I can’t promise anything this morning. I’m just saying that the targeted approach is, I think, the best way.”</td>

They were moved from the country’s massive refugee camps that are home to around a million members of the persecuted community. Most of the refugees were forced to flee their native Myanmar, which borders Bangladesh, after a brutal Burmese military campaign in 2017.<br />Bangladesh authorities developed the island of Bhasan Char, which wasn’t previously inhabited, to accommodate around 100,000 refugees, an effort to ease congestion in the squalid camps. But the relocation plan has been controversial from the start.<br />The island has only existed since around 2003, formed by a buildup of loose silt. Human-rights groups warn it may be vulnerable to extreme weather in an area that is cyclone-prone. It is also hard to reach, located about three hours by boat from the nearest mainland town, and could be difficult for humanitarian workers to access.<br />The United Nations refugee agency has distanced itself from the project.

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet picks will face a narrow path in the Senate next year, with the confirmation process providing an early test of the new administration’s ability to work with Republicans amid heightened partisan rancor over nominees.<br />Republicans are set to hold at least 50 seats, compared with 48 for Democrats, with two seats from Georgia up for grabs in runoff elections scheduled for Jan. 5. In a 50-50 Senate, Democrats would hold the majority, as incoming Vice President Kamala Harris would break any ties. If Democrats fall short, Republicans would be in charge, the first time in decades that a new president has a Senate controlled by the opposite party.<br />Mr. Biden has announced picks for his national security and economic teams, two areas where the Senate tends to move most quickly on confirmations, typically starting with hearings in the new year and holding votes as soon as Jan. 20. So far, some individual nominees have drawn opposition, but many Republican senators have signaled they plan to broadly show deference to Mr. Biden as he assembles his team, rather than actively obstruct his efforts.<br />“There are some that are clearly coming with baggage that may make it very difficult for the Senate to approve them,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) of the nominees. “I give the president the benefit of the doubt if it’s a close call. If it’s not a close call, you let the chips fall.”<br />“The president should be able to have his team,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.), who expects to sit down with nominees before committee hearings. “But I don’t think that’s a blanket statement that you rubber-stamp folks.”</td>

Think fancy consumables specific to the hotel’s region, an unusual toy, local things unavailable anywhere else.<br />If your loved ones have a favorite hotel, to which they return time and again, but can’t this year, a souvenir from its gift shop can be especially thoughtful. Ideal for Aunt Jane who’s been itching to get back to Claridge’s? The London landmark is now selling its tea service for the first time via its online store.<br />Aunt Jane will be thrilled and you can feel good about yourself: Online Christmas shopping via hotel boutique helps the hard-hit hospitality industry, too. Many top names offer gift cards for future travel. But in the meantime, here’s a wish list of things you can get online and have delivered directly, even if the hotel is closed:<br />Opened in 1951 when the Sersale family (and current owners) converted their house into a hotel, this small resort that hugs the Amalfi Coast is an Italian dream come true, with a boutique so chic that the wares—from vibrant caftan to snappy swim trunks—are also sold on Net-a-Porter. Standout item: the Suzani-inspired pillow cases (from $316) that mimic textiles used throughout the 58-room property. emporiosirenuse.com<br />On the ground floor of this reinvented 1930s downtown hotel, the Keep Shop boutique features a range of home goods and clothing, most made in the Southern U.S., including Stetson cowboy hats (from $125) and an indigo kimono jacket from Nashville designer Oil + Lumber ($175). noelle-nashville.com, keep.shop</td>

But Pyongyang’s image makers are now peddling a softer image of the Kim regime, which is best known for being nuclear-armed, reclusive and impoverished.<br />The makeover attempts surfaced last month, when, in an unusual tactic, separate  Twitter  accounts appeared bearing the names of two Pyongyang bureaucrats: Kim Myong Il, a negotiator who appeared at 2018 inter-Korean talks, and Han Song Il, of a Pyongyang institute considered to be a propaganda agency. The posts—in English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean—depicted everyday life.<br />“It’s finally kimchi season,” the account bearing Mr. Kim’s name tweeted on Nov. 11. “Just thinking about our healthy and tasty kimchi makes my mouth water.”<br />Days before North Korea’s Mother’s Day on Nov. 16, a tweet on the account read, “Mother, much love and respect to you.”</td>

      <td>China is rolling out new measures to help seniors, as the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbates the digital divide for its rapidly aging population.<br />The State Council, China’s cabinet, released a document last week calling on businesses and local authorities to take steps to assist seniors, including accepting cash and allowing paper alternatives to the digital health codes that have been required to access most public places—from hospitals to shopping centers to office buildings—during the pandemic.<br />China, which has leapfrogged other countries in the use of digital payments, was already tricky terrain for those uncomfortable with technology. But the pandemic has amplified the problem.<br />Recent incidents have sparked outrage on Chinese social media over poor treatment of the elderly. In August, state broadcaster CCTV and other Chinese media reported that an elderly man had been forced off a bus during rush hour in Harbin, in northern Heilongjiang province, because he didn’t scan his health code.<br />Last week, Chinese media reported that an elderly person in Yichang, in central Hubei province, had weathered the rain to pay for medical insurance but was rejected because cash wasn’t allowed.</td>

      <td>The NL used the designated hitter to help pitchers stay healthy during the 2020 pandemic season. No one knows yet whether it will be back next season.</td>
      <td>Only six players in baseball hit more home runs than Adam Duvall last season. The Atlanta Braves responded by cutting him on Wednesday, because they didn’t want to pay him the $4 million to $7 million he would’ve likely earned in salary arbitration later this winter.<br />The move came as a surprise, given Duvall’s ability, his relatively low cost and the Braves’ serious championship aspirations in 2021. They chose to let Duvall go in spite of all that in part for a particularly strange reason: The Braves, like the rest of the National League, still don’t know what one key rule of the game will be next year—even though spring training is supposed to start in just over two months.<br />MLB and the players’ union agreed to add the designated hitter to the NL for the pandemic-shortened 2020 campaign, ostensibly to help preserve pitchers’ health over the rigorous 60-game schedule. As of today, the universal DH won’t carry over into 2021, nor will any of the other experimental rules implemented as part of the sport’s safety protocols.<br />That could change before opening day, after the two sides hash out the details of how to stage a second season under the specter of Covid-19. People across the industry anticipate the DH becoming a part of those discussions, with the owners likely to dangle it as a bargaining chip in exchange for an expanded postseason tournament.<br />For now, however, pitchers are slated to bat in the NL, and the uncertainty has left front offices in the unusual position of trying to build a roster while a significant variable remains in flux.</td>

      <td>While Covid-19 has damaged company’s ride-share volume, it may have boosted margins somewhat</td>
      <td>Even  Lyft  can stand a break from the rat race.<br />The road to recovery has been slow for the ride-hailing company, but it has been smooth in some respects, according to comments at an investor conference this week. With so many people working at home because of the Covid-19 pandemic, much of Lyft’s business over the past few quarters has been done during off-peak hours, with riders going to doctor’s appointments or shopping for groceries midday, rather than grabbing a ride to and from work during peak hours. While that has meant missing the big-volume business of the daily commute, the shift seems to have at least been good for Lyft’s unit economics.<br />The company said at the investor conference that it can make more money on off-peak rides “because it costs less to incentivize drivers” without the massive surge in demand rush hour typically brings. That could help explain why Lyft believes it can pare its losses in the fourth quarter even while overall ride-share volumes remain significantly challenged. In an 8-K filing Wednesday, Lyft said it saw ride-share rides volume down 50% in November as a whole compared with a year earlier, which is even worse than the 48% decline for the first week of November that it shared on its third-quarter earnings call.<br />Nonetheless, the company said it expected to book a fourth-quarter loss of less than $185 million on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Last month its forecast implied a loss of $190 million to $210 million on that basis. Boosting its bottom line, according to Lyft, has been an improving contribution margin, which it expects will expand even further next year.<br />While the company didn’t provide other details on what specific expenses are moderating, it seems likely that they include lower costs associated with driver compensation, which makes sense based on the company’s commentary regarding the economics of a peak versus nonpeak ride. Indeed, the company indicated on its recent earnings call that it expects driver incentives in the fourth quarter would be lower as a percentage of revenue than in the third quarter as service levels improved. It also could be helping that some business has moved to the suburbs, where many regular riders have migrated from city centers. At the investor conference, Lyft’s president and co-founder, John Zimmer, said his company has benefited in some ways from consumers’ moving out of cities, where “there’s only so many cars you can get on the road.”</td>

      <td>Tech’s future in cars will likely be more evolutionary than revolutionary</td>
      <td>This is the final column in a four-part Heard on the Street series on how “smart” vehicles will affect the automotive, tech and insurance industries.<br />Big tech was going to revolutionize the car market. Then reality happened.<br />Just a few years ago, Silicon Valley seemed to have Detroit in its sights. Google had self-driving test cars roaming around, while  Apple  was building its own automated car from scratch. Chip giant  Intel  made its second largest acquisition ever with Mobileye for $15.3 billion in early 2017, while rival  Nvidia was building powerful chips designed to become the central brains of autonomous vehicles. And  Amazon.com  wasn’t even keeping its dreams on the ground. The e-commerce giant was testing air delivery drones in the U.K. by late 2016.<br />Most of those efforts haven’t died, but the hype has faded considerably. Apple seemed to make the biggest reversal, reportedly laying off more than 200 workers last year from its autonomous-car effort called Project Titan. Google is still at it, with its Waymo car venture now offering a highly limited taxi service in Phoenix. But Waymo remains buried in parent company  Alphabet Inc.’s  “other bets” segment, where it doesn’t appear to be generating much actual business. The company’s most recent quarterly filing said Other Bets revenue is still derived primarily from its broadband service once known as Google Fiber and licensing from its Verily Life Sciences venture.<br />Intel, meanwhile, hasn’t exactly revved up with Mobileye. Revenue for the unit, which makes computer-vision and driver-assistance technology, rose only 6% for the trailing 12-month period ended in September, lagging Intel’s overall revenue growth of 11% in that time. It also still makes up barely 1% of Intel’s overall business.</td>

      <td>Dividend policies for European banks are likely to diverge in the coming months. Investors shouldn’t take a resumption of generous payouts as a sure sign of relative strength.<br />Bank regulators that banned dividends during the spring lockdowns are expected to announce this month whether they will allow them again. Among other options, they could wait until stress tests are completed next summer, allow capped payouts on a case-by-case basis or remove all restrictions. There will be useful signals in what officials decide, and how lenders respond. But there are other things to consider before following the cash.<br />European bank shares have rallied since the mid-November vaccine news but are still down more than 15% on the year. The ban on payouts helped build sizable capital buffers—about 40% of market capitalization, calculates  Barclays .  Most lenders are lobbying hard for a green light to restart payouts they hope will boost stock prices, and take some of the sting for investors out of the big bonuses that banks will pay after a banner trading year.<br />Vaccines have ignited recovery hopes, but great uncertainties remain: how we will work, what credit losses will be once government-support programs end, what economic scars the downturn will leave. Generous shareholder payouts next year could leave some lenders susceptible. Officials will look at capital adequacy, profitability and risk, but will also consider factors beyond banks: their regulatory risk appetite, the importance of dividends to local investors, the range of banks in their jurisdiction and the signal the policy will send.<br />Switzerland has the lightest touch of the big European jurisdictions, allowing 2019 dividends to be paid, albeit in two installments rather than one. Both big Swiss banks received permission to pay their second tranche and  UBS  seems likely to resume share buybacks next year too. They have been helped by a relatively strong domestic market, with gross domestic product down an annualized 1.6% at the end of September.</td>

Acting now could help avoid surprise bills, interest and penalties when filing state taxes next year.<br />This year the coronavirus pandemic turned millions of workers into telecommuters, and many haven’t yet returned to the office. People who have worked from a state that isn’t their usual one may need to file returns and pay taxes to more than one state for 2020.<br />These requirements will come as a shock to many: More than 70% of Americans don’t know that telecommuting from another state can affect a worker’s state-tax bill, according to an October survey by The Harris Poll for the American Institute of CPAs.<br />“I’m very concerned about next year’s filing season. Lots of taxpayers will be stunned to find out how working remotely has complicated their state taxes,” says Jamie Yesnowitz, a state and local tax specialist in Grant Thornton’s national office.<br />The challenge is that each state’s tax system is a unique mix of rules. When someone owes income tax to more than one state, these systems often clash, and the taxpayer can wind up owing more tax, or the same, or (rarely) less. The outcome often depends on variables like tax rates, credits and agreements between the states.</td>

      <td>The U.S. economy likely continued to regain jobs in November, though forecasters project the pace slowed amid rising Covid-19 infections and new business restrictions.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast that employers added 440,000 jobs in November, down from the 638,000 jobs added in October. They project that the unemployment rate declined slightly to 6.7% from 6.9% in October.<br />Job growth has slowed each month since June and the economy faces near-term challenges, including a new surge of coronavirus infections that triggered some states and localities to impose new restrictions on business. The onset of winter could deter spending and job creation in sectors like restaurants that have become more reliant on business outdoors.<br />Still, the labor-market recovery from the pandemic’s job destruction this spring has been stronger than most economists forecast. Many expect widespread vaccine distribution to eventually help lift the economy as businesses are allowed to reopen and consumers feel more comfortable traveling, going to the movies and returning to other in-person activities involving proximity to other people.<br />“As infection rates go down, as the number of people vaccinated goes up, then we’ll start to see…business activity expand at a faster rate, and we will see the employment numbers pick up more strongly,” said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.</td>

      <td>Fate of postmaster general may hinge on outcome of Senate runoffs in Georgia</td>
      <td>LOUIS DEJOY, the Republican donor-cum-postmaster general, was a top target for Democrats who accused him of slowing down mail ahead of an election with record absentee voting and instituting cost cuts that worsened services. But even after President-elect Joe Biden takes office, DeJoy will prove hard to replace. Postmasters general serve at the pleasure of the U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors, and can’t be directly fired by a president. Trump Republican appointees hold a 4-2 majority on the board, which can have up to three more governors.<br />Like much else in Washington, DeJoy’s fate may be linked to the outcome of the Georgia runoffs for U.S. Senate. Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees the USPS, are eager to fill the vacant seats on the board and move away from the “cost cutting mentality” among Postal Service leadership that has contributed to declines in service, said an aide to the committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Gary Peters. DeJoy has testified that the changes were meant to improve operational efficiency. The USPS is on track to lose more than $10 billion this year. After early criticism, DeJoy in August promised to give priority to the delivery of mail ballots, and while there were some delays and missing ballots, the vast majority of mail-in ballots were delivered on time to election officials<br />Biden told a postal-workers union during the campaign that he would move to fill the board vacancies. Incoming top committee Republican Sen. Rob Portman “will review any nominations as they come before the committee,” his spokeswoman said.<br />Neither Peters nor Biden has directly called for DeJoy to step down, as some progressive Democrats have. But a nine-member board controlled by Democratic appointees could make that decision itself. “The U.S. Postal Service will welcome all qualified members to the board—a decision reserved for the President and the Senate, who are tasked with nominating and confirming board members,” USPS spokesman David Partenheimer said.<br /></td>

Collectively called “buy now, pay later,” these providers enable merchants to be paid up front but give shoppers the ability to spread the cost over weeks or months, often for zero interest, rather than just putting it all on a credit or debit card at once.<br />Financing has, of course, long been available for certain purchases like cars or couches. What distinguishes today’s BNPL is being fully digital, accessible almost instantly, even for small purchases, and very often at zero interest.<br />BNPL has now caught investors’ attention, too. A November  Bank of America  analyst note estimated global volume may grow to around $650 billion to $1 trillion by 2025, roughly 10 to 15 times the current market. A handful of listed companies—such as Afterpay,  Sezzle  and Quadpay owner  Zip Co. , all trading on Australia’s  ASX —specialize in BNPL and are among the hotter stocks in the already-hot digital-payments sector. Afterpay, the biggest by market value, is up over 220% this year. Meanwhile, Affirm Holdings has filed to go public in New York, and Klarna Holding raised a private round at a valuation of nearly $11 billion.<br />Retailers have increasingly high expectations for these firms to help boost revenue.

Phoenix has hosted tournaments featuring hundreds of teams, with thousands of athletes at a time—even as coronavirus cases surged and modelers said Arizona’s number of Covid-19 hospitalizations could exceed the number of hospital beds by around Christmas.<br />The resulting tension between these events and the Covid surge came to a head when Phoenix’s city council gathered Wednesday night for a virtual meeting. With tournaments promising to bring together tens of thousands of young athletes, coaches and parents in the coming months, the council voted 7-2 to cancel all organized sports at the city’s fields until virus levels in Maricopa County return to a moderate level.<br />The debate pitted some parents and youth sports advocates, who argued that organized sports were safe and healthy for kids during the pandemic, against others including the mayor and public health experts who warned that the events could further spread the virus.<br />Phoenix’s ruling doesn’t affect the state’s professional or college teams, such as Arizona State in nearby Tempe, only facilities managed by the city’s Parks and Recreation Department.
