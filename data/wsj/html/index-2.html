      <td>TOKYO— Toshiba Corp.’s  chairman was ousted in a vote at the company’s annual meeting, a milestone in Japanese shareholder activism that followed an uproar over collaboration between the firm’s management and government to stifle foreign investors.<br />Shareholders voted against the re-election of Osamu Nagayama, former head of a  Roche Holding AG  subsidiary in Japan. The exact vote count wasn’t released.<br />The vote followed controversy over a shareholder-commissioned report released June 10. The report by outside lawyers found that Toshiba management and some directors worked closely with officials at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry to block overseas shareholders from exercising their rights.<br />Toshiba executives used inappropriate language such as “beat them up,” and the ministry improperly tried to use a foreign-investment law to threaten foreign shareholders, the report said. Toshiba said it took the report’s conclusions seriously, while the ministry said there was nothing unusual about consulting with company executives about potential national-security risks from foreign investment.<br />The report didn’t mention any direct involvement by Mr. Nagayama in the activity, but several foreign shareholders said they held the chairman responsible for the conduct. Institutional shareholders like Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management had expressed their intent to vote against Mr. Nagayama.</td>

      <td>Biden and Pelosi hold a Senate deal hostage to the rest of their agenda.</td>
      <td>Politicians in Washington renege on their bipartisan promises all the time, but what are we to make of a deal in which one side admits it is pulling a bait and switch from the start? That was the astonishing news Thursday as President Biden and Speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed a bipartisan Senate infrastructure deal even as they said the price of their support is getting the rest of their agenda too.<br />Mr. Biden stood with five Democratic and five Republican Senators at the White House and endorsed their trillion-dollar infrastructure outline. Back-slapping and self-plaudits all around. But two hours later the President said he won’t sign the infrastructure bill unless the Senate also passes the other $3 trillion or more he has proposed in tax increases and multiple new entitlement programs.<br />“What we agreed on today is what we could agree on. The physical infrastructure. There’s no agreement on the rest,” Mr. Biden said. “If this is the only thing that comes to me, I’m not signing it.” Mrs. Pelosi issued the same ultimatum: “We will not take up a bill in the House until the Senate passes the bipartisan bill and a reconciliation bill” (that could pass without GOP support).<br />Most politicians at least wait a decent interval to pull a double cross. But Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Biden are trying to prevent a revolt on the left. So they are now holding a bipartisan deal hostage to the left’s demands. This is political blackmail aimed at Democrats like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema who are part of the bipartisan Senate Gang of 10: Unless they sign on to all of the progressive tax-and-spend agenda, they won’t get their bipartisan deal. And Mr. Biden and progressives will blame them for the failure.<br />This is remarkable bad faith even for Washington. We’ll have more to say about the details of the bipartisan deal as they emerge. But Thursday’s comments make clear this exercise isn’t bipartisan at all. The Pelosi-Biden political goal is to use this Senate deal as leverage to jam through the rest of their progressive wish list.</td>

      <td>The pandemic is easing, but the agency extends its eviction ban.</td>
      <td>Covid cases have plunged 96% since early January. Nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults have at least once vaccine dose, and states have lifted virus restrictions. Yet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday declared that the public-health emergency continues and extended its nationwide eviction moratorium for another 30 days.<br />The Trump CDC committed the original constitutional sin when it imposed the eviction ban last September. It cited the 1944 Public Health Service Act, which allows the agency to take measures to prevent the spread of communicable diseases between states. Supposedly, people who were evicted would move in with family or friends and spread the disease.<br />Tenants who expected to earn less than $99,000 ($198,000 for couples) merely had to claim that they lost income and would be homeless or forced to move in with someone if they were evicted. Although the moratorium was supposed to end in December, Congress extended it by a month. Then the Biden CDC extended it twice through June.<br />Meanwhile, several lower courts have ruled that the eviction ban exceeds the CDC’s authority. “Under its reading, so long as the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] can make a determination that a given measure is ‘necessary’ to combat the interstate or international spread of disease, there is no limit to the reach of his authority,” federal Judge Dabney Friedrich wrote last month.<br />Judge Friedrich stayed her injunction pending appeal, but landlords are asking the Supreme Court to lift the stay. The Administration in its brief snips a phrase from the Court’s injunction last year of New York’s arbitrary limits on religious gatherings to argue that Justices “‘should respect the judgment of those with special expertise and responsibility in this area.’”</td>

      <td>Better pricing will help taxpayers unless Congress interferes.</td>
      <td>Good deeds from federal agencies are rare, and the few put forward don’t go unpunished. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is currently taking a beating for trying to rationalize Washington’s much-abused flood-insurance program.<br />The Senate Banking Committee held a hearing last Thursday to discuss Risk Rating 2.0, FEMA’s plan to adjust premiums for the National Flood Insurance Program. The rating system would scrap current pricing based on flood zones that were devised in 1978, in favor of a new formula that tailors prices to each property.<br />That means premium increases for most policyholders. David Maurstad, who manages the program and testified Thursday, says the adjustments would better offset the costs of the flood program, which paid $1.2 billion in claims last year.<br />The new formula would also shift the burden toward owners of more valuable properties. Seventy-seven percent of policyholders would see their premiums rise, but “two-thirds of homeowners who have pre-FIRM subsidized homes are going to see a reduction in their premium,” Mr. Maurstad said. These are houses built before the “flood-insurance rate map” took effect in 1974, owned disproportionately by lower-income policyholders.<br />Cue the criticism from the caucus that wants taxpayers in Kansas to subsidize owners who keep rebuilding homes on the shore. Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy attacked FEMA’s reform plan as a “ferret fire drill” that would soak residents of flood-prone areas. Mr. Kennedy, who called the hearing, has introduced a bill to block the premium increases from taking effect Oct. 1. New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez is writing a bill with the same purpose, and called the new rating system “anything but equitable.”</td>

It may well be a test of whether bipartisanship can survive in today’s Washington on any big subject.<br />After all, if bipartisanship can’t be achieved on infrastructure—the motherhood-and-apple-pie issue of our times, where every lawmaker gets to send some federal dollars back home for projects their constituents can see and use—where can it happen?<br />That doesn’t mean the $1.2 trillion deal—which would represent one of the biggest investments ever made in the country’s operating systems—is sure to survive. It will face serious challenges on both left and right and could fall off the rails at many points in the weeks ahead.<br />What this deal may have going for it, though, is the yearning that many officials in both parties have to show they still know how to do this kind of thing together—and perhaps some reluctance to be seen as the skunk at this particular garden party.<br />The picture that emerged Thursday, of a president walking out the White House doors to stand with senators from both parties to announce an agreement on a big piece of legislation, shouldn’t be as startling as it was. It used to happen regularly; now, it seldom does.</td>

      <td>I created a special seminar to discuss controversial issues freely, and the results were eye-opening.</td>
      <td>Durham, N.C.<br />The conservative critique of American higher education is well known to Journal readers: The universities are run by intolerant progressives. The left counters with an insult: The lack of intellectually respectable conservative arguments is responsible for campus political uniformity. Perhaps a better starting point in this debate is the students, most of whom actually want freer discourse on campus. They want to be challenged by views they don’t hold.<br />This, at least, has been my recurring experience with undergraduates at Duke University, where I teach classes called “Political Polarization” and “Conservatism” that require my students to engage with all sides of today’s hottest political issues.<br />True engagement, though, requires honesty. In an anonymous survey of my 110 students this spring, 68% told me they self-censor on certain political topics even around good friends. That includes self-described conservative students, but also half of the liberals. “As a Duke student, it is difficult to be both a liberal and a Zionist,” one wrote. Another remarked, “Although I support most BLM ideas, I do not feel that I can have any conversation that even slightly criticizes the movement.”<br />To get students to stop self-censoring, a few agreed-on classroom principles are necessary. On the first day, I tell students that no one will be canceled, meaning no social or professional penalties for students resulting from things they say inside the class. If you believe in policing your fellow students, I say, you’re in the wrong room. I insist that goodwill should always be assumed, and that all opinions can be voiced, provided they are offered in the spirit of humility and charity. I give students a chance to talk about the fact that they can no longer talk. I let them share their anxieties about being socially or professionally penalized for dissenting. What students discover is that they are not alone in their misgivings.</td>

      <td>Results in the primary suggest the next mayor is unlikely to be an AOC-style extreme progressive.</td>
      <td>What just happened in New York? Something hopeful.<br />In the Democratic primary, which took place Tuesday, the candidates for mayor reflected competing party realities. Each brought a particular vibration. City Comptroller Scott Stringer was Abe Beame without the charisma. Former Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia was the woman on the train working a hard job in the city, the kind of middle manager who keeps the whole place going. Manhattan loved her. Andrew Yang was a good person, refreshing and unpredictable—refreshing because unpredictable—but he didn’t know the city in his gut. Activist Maya Wiley was elegant, dignified, had presence and warmth, but her policies were those of the detached academic, all progressive ideology. She wouldn’t say in debate that she’d refuse to disarm the police.<br />Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, currently in first place by nearly 10 points, scrambled things up. In the war between the abstract and the real, he backed reality. Opposition to his candidacy had a constant undercurrent: He’s an old-time machine pol, a deal maker, corrupt, he doesn’t even live in New York. Everyone heard these things. A lot didn’t care because of the other thing they knew, which is that Mr. Adams was a cop for 22 years, left the New York City Police Department as a captain, and was the first and for a long time the only candidate to campaign on crime and the public’s right to safety. He was the first to admit we were in a crime wave.<br />That was considered cheap until it was considered visionary. (The NYPD reports shootings were up 73% last month, compared with May 2020.)<br />Mr. Adams’s election-night speech had an air of lovely bitterness: “How dare those with their philosophical and intellectual theorizing and their classroom mindset talking about the ‘theory of policing’?” he said. “You don’t know this. I know this. I’m going to keep my city safe.”</td>

Although we’re less than a mile apart, I live on a half-acre lot in the center of town, while Peter is surrounded by 305 acres of pristine cornfields, meadows, orchards, ponds, pastures and woodlands. From his barnyard looking north toward the Taconic Hills, a Grant Wood painting spans across your entire field of vision.<br />Peter has turned me down before, but I thought I might finally persuade him to grant a sliver for me and my wife to build a modest farmhouse. He’s 71 and hints of retiring to the Canary Islands. Meanwhile, every cottage, fixer-upper and speck of dirt within miles is being snapped up at record prices, as New Yorkers flee the pandemic and flock to some version of country living. With taxes and upkeep a drain, Peter knows this would be a great time to cash out some of his holdings, or  Airbnb  one of his four houses.<br />Peter seems the classic gentleman farmer. A former Manhattan art dealer by way of Cologne, Germany, he and his wife, Thordis, acquired their first 260 acres in 1986. With zero experience in agriculture or animal husbandry, they nonetheless took on 100 head of Angus cattle to raise beef, started a hay business and tree nursery, bred chickens (foxes permitting) and rented their fields for corn and soybeans. As more land became available, they grabbed it.<br />Eventually, the cattle disappeared and the costs of transporting the mature trees became prohibitive. Peter’s blue silo sits empty, as does his red barn. But his vast crop fields remain fertile and the chickens run free, even if he gives away their eggs. The entire spread is immaculately maintained with grassy lanes cleaner than a kitchen counter and a magical canopy of maple trees framing the roadway that runs past his house.</td>

      <td>Greek gods and folkloric heroes may no longer occupy the center of our imaginations, but other stories have taken their place.</td>
      <td>A persistent myth of the modern West is that it has outgrown the need for myths, along with religion, magic and other “irrational” beliefs of the benighted past. This triumphalist story of rationality was proclaimed by Enlightenment philosophers and documented by later social scientists; through the 1990s, “the disenchantment of the world” became an incantation within the parched groves of academe.<br />Science writer Philip Ball is among those who counter that enchantment and modernity aren’t incompatible. In “The Modern Myths” he makes a persuasive case that myth isn’t gone but can be found in stories closer to our current obsessions such as science and technology, globalization and individual psychology. For this reason, he denies the status of myth to popular narratives like “The Lord of the Rings,” the “Harry Potter” franchise, and “Star Wars”: they simply repackage traditional stories. (His provocations to debate are among the book’s many pleasures.) Instead, he takes up stories whose plotlines, heroes and villains have become so resonant that we recognize them even if we haven’t encountered the foundational text. This is certainly true for his seven core examples: “Robinson Crusoe,” “Frankenstein,” “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” “Dracula,” Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes, “The War of the Worlds” and DC Comics’ Batman stories.<br />Crucially, the original story in each case is but the pretext for the slow emergence of a modern myth, not the myth itself. The tale becomes widely accessible—and assumes profounder meanings—by being repurposed and diffused via multiple media, including stage, screen, radio, comics and video games. Myths are never invented deliberately but chosen by the culture for its own contingent needs: “A myth is typically not a story but an evolving web of many stories—interweaving, interacting, contradicting each other.” With wit and common sense, Mr. Ball defends the power of fantasy to challenge the status quo, even as he acknowledges its capacity to ratify prejudices. His approach to myth accords with Leszek Kolakowski’s vital admonition: “A mythology can be socially fruitful only when it is unceasingly suspect.”<br />In each chapter, Mr. Ball shows how a particular modern myth begins with a text potently charged by the author’s own psychic ambivalences. Such personal concerns also express, in an intuitive rather than reasoned way, anxieties about developments shared by others within the culture. This renders the work of wider interest, as does its focus on plot rather than complex characterizations or refined style. Mr. Ball determines that modern myths stem from fantasy, with its capacity to literalize metaphors and articulate dreams, rather than from realism. Even Daniel Defoe’s “Robinson Crusoe” is more a wish-fulfillment than a plausible account of a shipwrecked seaman.<br />Take Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” (1897), which built on earlier 19th-century vampire narratives, some written by more capable writers, including Alexei Tolstoy and J. Sheridan Le Fanu. Why was Stoker’s tale granted immortal life and theirs only an occasional resurrection? Vampirism was already associated with sensuality, but Stoker infused the novel with his deep fears of sexuality, women and strangers. “Where before there had been an enticing scent of sexual allure,” Mr. Ball writes, “now there was lust and rape fantasy.” Stoker’s crude misogyny and xenophobia struck a chord at a time when women were demanding equal rights and when fears of “foreigners”—especially Jews—were intensifying. This fortuitous meeting of (unconscious) minds, Mr. Ball shows, is the first step in the evolution of oddball thriller into modern myth.</td>

      <td>As the country picks up speed in its race to herd immunity, stumbling may mean a dangerous variant.</td>
      <td>As India recovers from a brutal second wave of the Covid pandemic, it faces a new challenge: Can it quickly vaccinate enough people to minimize the risk of a third?<br />Over the first three days of this week, India jabbed 21 million people—a significant acceleration. Stepping up vaccinations, combined with protection gained from a large number of Covid infections, could carry the country toward herd immunity by year’s end. But this week’s surge in vaccinations may not be sustainable, and the duration of protection provided by previous exposure to the virus remains uncertain.<br />The high stakes for India are self-evident. Covid has battered the country’s economy, diminished its international standing, and raised serious questions about its government’s competence. Officially, about 392,000 Indians had died of Covid as of Wednesday. But many experts say that figure is a gross underestimate.<br />India’s battle against the disease also matters disproportionately to the global effort against Covid. The longer the virus continues to spread, the more variants can emerge, and a nation with one-sixth of the world’s population is a potentially huge incubator.<br />The highly contagious Delta variant sweeping the world was first detected in India. This mutation has already led to an uptick in cases in the U.K. and is set to become the dominant strain in the U.S. This week, White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said the Delta variant is the “greatest threat” to eliminating Covid in America. He expects the strain to be “quite dominant” in the U.S. within several weeks to a month. The longer India’s vaccination effort takes, the higher the odds of other variants emerging there, including some that may be immune to current vaccines.</td>

      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />What makes a college athlete an “amateur”? Earlier this week, the Supreme Court threw up its hands at this thorny semantic question.<br />The National Collegiate Athletic Association bars compensating student athletes in the name of protecting “amateurism”—a “revered tradition,” according to a Supreme Court decision on the matter back in 1984. But this week, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court found “amateurism” too nebulous a concept, too poorly defined even by the NCAA, to serve as the basis for denying modest payments.<br />The term “amateur” has never had a straightforward meaning. It comes from French, which in turn took it from the Latin root “amator,” meaning “lover” or “enthusiastic admirer.” When the word was borrowed into English in the 18th century, it developed a range of subtle nuances.<br />Following its original Latin sense, “amateur” could simply refer to someone who is enthusiastic about something. In 1788, a writer for The European Magazine and London Review remarked that the architectural work on Carlton House, a royal residence, “must be highly pleasing to every amateur of the fine arts.”</td>

      <td>Plan secures bipartisan agreement on overhauling the nation’s transportation, water and broadband infrastructure</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden and a group of 10 centrist senators agreed to a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure plan Thursday, securing a long-sought bipartisan deal that lawmakers and the White House will now attempt to shepherd through Congress alongside a broader package sought by Democrats.<br />Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders said that advancing the deal on transportation, water and broadband infrastructure will hinge on the passage of more elements of Mr. Biden’s $4 trillion economic agenda. The two-track process sets up weeks of delicate negotiations to gather support for both the bipartisan plan and a separate Democratic proposal, a challenging task in the 50-50 Senate and the narrowly Democratic-controlled House.<br />“What we agreed on today is what we could agree on. The physical infrastructure. There’s no agreement on the rest,” said Mr. Biden, who said he wouldn’t sign the bipartisan deal into law until a bill containing the rest of his agenda also is on his desk. “If this is the only one that comes to me, I’m not signing it.”<br />With $579 billion of spending above expected federal levels and a total of $973 billion of investment over five years and $1.2 trillion if continued over eight, the agreement will make new investments in the electrical grid, transit, roads and bridges and other forms of infrastructure.<br />The cost of the spending will be covered by repurposing existing federal funds, public-private partnerships and revenue collected from enhanced enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service, according to a list distributed by the White House. The list also included sales from the strategic petroleum reserve and wireless-spectrum auction sales among the other revenue raisers.</td>

      <td>Starring Vin Diesel, Ludacris and Michelle Rodriguez, the action franchise’s latest installment teems with decked-out cars, tests of strength and high-octane speed.</td>
      <td>In the old days, meaning before the first installment of the “Fast and Furious” franchise in 2001, one of the measures of a good car was its ability to hold the road. Now the ninth installment is upon us—“F9: The Fast Saga”—and cars in it not only leave the road and fly, which they did in “Furious 7,” but a battered old Pontiac Fiero strapped to a rocket slips the surly bonds of Earth and goes into orbit. The whole series has been about slipping bonds (the rules of the road, the laws of polite society, the stuffy dictates of physics, gravity and logic); severing connections (between cause and effect), or blurring distinctions (between good and bad entertainment). The films are critic-proof, of course, and mockery-proof in the bargain. “F9” makes a mockery of itself before anyone else can—it’s a gleefully shoddy goof on a pseudo-epic scale.<br />As far as the plot is concerned, I’ll do my best to describe a storyline that jumps back and forth in time and defies description, let alone concision. (At the moment, Wikipedia, which usually summarizes movie plots clearly, carries an editorial warning about the semicoherent ramble on its “F9” page: “This section’s plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise.”)<br />When the film opens, Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto is out of the game and enjoying a bucolic retirement in the bosom of his family. Then comes word of a grandiose scheme to reboot the world order. Who knew the world order could be rebooted? Well, Dom discovers that it can, and that it will be by means of Project Aries, a vast satellite-based weapon system designed to override anything that runs on code. In other words, an everything weapon that’s about to be activated by Cipher, a cybergenius played by Charlize Theron—in “F8” someone likened Cipher to “a digital act of god,” whatever that means—working in cahoots with Dom’s younger brother, Jakob (a grim-faced John Cena). Unless, that is, Dom reunites his team, which he does with dispatch, thereby taking this installment beneath and beyond James Bond into the realm of scattershot sci-fi and, in the process, saving the world so all its perfervid drivers can drive another day.<br />Any questions? I have several. Why does the usually formidable Ms. Theron appear so briefly, and mostly in a glass cage, like a snarky oracle with spectacular eye shadow? How do Dom and his teammates know where they’re going after they and their various vehicles plunge into Montecito, a Central American country with terrible roads? (The everything answer, which applies to the whole movie, may be that driving, not getting there, is the point.) Why do Dom and his team journey, however fleetingly, to the Caspian Sea? Who knows, but hey, locations, locations, locations. Familiar ones include a backlot Tokyo, the signature setting for the exceedingly silly 2006 installment “Tokyo Drift,” and London, where Dom takes a ride on the wild side with Helen Mirren’s elegantly raffish Queenie Shaw. Also Edinburgh, an underused location where Jakob has deployed a hugely powerful electromagnet to advance his nefarious scheme. (It’s almost touching that old-fashioned magnetism figures so prominently in a movie that’s awash in high-concept tech.)<br />The director was Justin Lin, the gifted action specialist who hasn’t done one of these episodes since “Fast & Furious 6” in 2013. He and Daniel Casey wrote the screenplay, which adheres to a timeworn principle. If the screen isn’t filled by hurtling muscle cars, motorcycles and exotic trucks—one armored vehicle in this escapade looks to be a 48-wheeler, give or take a dozen or so—then bemuscled men and women must be beating up on one another.</td>

      <td>The PBS documentary series conducts a compelling investigation into the rise of extremism in a country that has known its terrors.</td>
      <td>‘It was Yom Kippur, it was not every day,” says a witness in “Frontline: Germany’s Neo-Nazis and the Far Right” (Tuesday, 10 p.m., PBS), which opens with memories of the October 2019 attack on a synagogue in Halle, Germany. The attacker, too, knew that it was not every day. It was the one in the year that was most sacred to Jews, which was why there would be a great many of them in the synagogue—a condition essential to his plan. The assassin had come to the scene attired in full combat fatigues. That fact comes from a broadcast bringing word of the attack, a description characteristic of the detail that gives this riveting and richly complex “Frontline” presentation (Evan Williams, reporter-director) its powerful sense of immediacy. So—if with far less subtlety—do the furious efforts of the attacker with murder in his heart, who keeps trying, and failing, to break through the locked door of the synagogue. Which doesn’t prevent him, a while later, from killing two people at random before he’s captured.<br />This killer, we learn, is 27-year-old Stephan Balliet, a man who lives with his mother and who, as he soon shows, now considers himself a loser: His plan had been to kill many people, and in that he had fallen far short.<br />But who Balliet was and the ambition that drove him would become still more clear thanks to a manifesto he had left on his computer—a document so telling it would be presented to the jury at his trial. To underscore the seriousness of the defendant’s plan to massacre Jews, the prosecutor produced copious abstracts from Balliet’s writing. Jews, he declared, were not only parasites who had infested the world for nearly 2,000 years—they had also “invented Communism, feminism and Christianity.” And, as he wrote, they—the Jews—had spread these things in Europe to “weaken the White man and enslave him.”<br />Balliet was far from alone in his views. He had streamed his attack in English, an authority on far-right networking notes, in the confidence that it would reach a global audience. People in America, we learn further, are no small part of this online fellowship. Balliet’s video was indeed widely seen, and generated messages of hearty support, several of which are shown in this film.<br />For all that he represents, though, the character of Balliet isn’t equal to the drama of Germany itself, facing the growth of extremist groups that do regular training while waiting for something called Day X—units that include more than a few former members of the military and the police. Their ranks are well populated with Germans bitter over government policies that led to a great influx of refugees—especially those who arrived as a result of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s determination, in 2015, to welcome hundreds of thousands seeking escape from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.</td>

Many analysts predicted donanemab would be approved, perhaps by the middle of next year, and become a multibillion-dollar seller.<br />Shares in Biogen, meanwhile, dropped 6.1% on concerns the company’s newly approved Alzheimer’s drug could face stiff competition sooner than expected.

      <td>Revisit Athol Fugard’s semi-autobiographical account of apartheid via this affecting virtual performance by Syracuse Stage.</td>
      <td>Athol Fugard, South Africa’s greatest playwright, is no longer produced in the U.S. as often as he used to be. The reason for this, however, is a happy one: Now that apartheid, the subject matter of most of his plays, is a thing of the past, they have inevitably lost some of their immediacy. Today they are period pieces—but the best of them are also great plays, dramatically vital time capsules that re-enact a hideous episode in history, and they continue to work superlatively well onstage.<br />What I’ve been wondering about ever since Syracuse Stage announced that it was reviving “‘Master Harold’ . . . and the Boys,” the 1982 play that made Mr. Fugard famous, is the impression that would now be made by a work about apartheid by a white author. The notion that people of color should be telling their own stories has lately hardened into something not far from an orthodoxy, and “‘Master Harold’”—which is set in 1950 and tells the story of the deteriorating relationship between Hally (Nick Apostolina), a white teenager, and Sam and Willie (L. Peter Callender and Phumzile Sojola), two 40ish Black servants who helped to raise him and whom he regards as friends—doesn’t fit into that framework. But “‘Master Harold,’” lest we forget, is Mr. Fugard’s story, too, a semi-autobiographical dramatization of a shameful episode from his own youth, and he tells it so powerfully that you’ll feel at evening’s end that you’ve had a privileged glimpse into another, sadder world.<br />At age 17, Hally feels the growing pains of adolescence and remembers with nostalgia the simpler world of childhood that he shared with Sam and Willie: “It’s just that life felt the right size in there . . . not too big and not too small. Wasn’t so hard to work up a bit of courage. It’s got so bloody complicated since then.” At the same time, he is also increasingly inclined to the arrogance that is another sign of his age, and the morally corrupt society in which he lives is feeding it. Bit by bit, he reveals that his soul has been poisoned by apartheid, and at length he drops the mask of civility and shows what lies beneath: “Don’t try to be clever, Sam. It doesn’t suit you. . . . You’re only a servant in here, and don’t forget it.”<br />What follows, however predictable, is still thrilling to behold: Sam tears off his waiter’s livery (both figuratively and, for a moment, literally, a stunning coup de théâtre) and answers Hally not as a servant but as a mortally offended man.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Fugard follows this fiery climax with a 10-minute speech in which Sam tells us everything we have been shown in the preceding 90 minutes, but the dramatic mainspring of the play has been wound up tightly enough by then to propel us all the way to the final curtain. Gilbert McCauley, the director, has staged the results plainly and well, taping the show in an empty theater, and his three actors are beyond praise, especially Mr. Callender. I saw Danny Glover, who created the role of Willy in 1982, play Sam in the 2003 Broadway revival of “‘Master Harold,’” and Mr. Callender’s performance is in some ways even more memorable.</td>

      <td>The discovery by the Cowessess First Nation comes as Canada confronts the treatment of Indigenous people</td>
      <td>An Indigenous community in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan said it found 751 unmarked graves near a former boarding school, weeks after a similar discovery at another school set off a nationwide discussion about Canada’s treatment of Indigenous people.<br />The Cowessess First Nation, located about a two-hour drive east of Regina, Saskatchewan, said Thursday it began searching the area of the Marieval Indian Residential School earlier this month. The school operated between the late 1890s and 1997, and was part of a nationwide system that removed Indigenous children from their families over the course of more than a century and suppressed their culture and language. A 2015 report by Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that the system amounted to cultural genocide.<br />In many cases, students who were sent to so-called residential schools endured physical and sexual abuse, the report found. An estimated 4,100 children died of disease or by accident while in the system, although some Indigenous leaders believe the number is much higher.<br />Cowessess First Nation Chief Cadmus Delorme said on Thursday that researchers used ground-penetrating radar, which looks for changes in the soil’s water and salt content, to search the area. He said the search identified 751 possible graves, and that researchers indicated there is a 10% to 15% margin of error on their findings.<br />Chief Delorme said children who died while attending the Marieval school were buried at the site and their graves may have been marked in the past. However, he said headstones were later removed by representatives from the Catholic Church, which ran the school for many years. He added that it isn’t known whether all of the unmarked graves the community discovered represent former students at the residential school, and it is possible that some adult community members were buried on the site as well. Most of the graves are spaced evenly apart, he said, and each one is now marked by a small flag.</td>

      <td>Taking the winged creatures as its primary subject, an exhibition at the Toledo Museum of Art examines the intersection of natural history and colonialism.</td>
      <td><br />Toledo, Ohio<br />It’s the season when birders migrate en masse to follow avian aerial travels. That means it’s also the season for the Toledo Museum of Art, not far from some choice sites, to offer an associated exhibition, as it has nearly every year since 2012. This time—with “Rare and Wondrous: Birds in Art and Culture, 1620-1820,” organized by Paula Reich, the museum’s manager of gallery interpretation—something more ambitious is undertaken. And in the current political climate the show also illustrates some migratory patterns developing in the museum world.<br />First there are the offerings: 35 artifacts spanning two centuries, including etchings, paintings, books, porcelain dinnerware and a music box with a mechanical bird covered in real hummingbird feathers. “Exotic birds,” the exhibition tells us, “permeated the art and culture of Europe from the 1600s into the 1800s” as they were brought back from journeys of exploration and trade. Canaries, for example, pictured here in a 1737 guide, were first transported to Spain from the Canary Islands in the 15th century. Some birds were less fortunate; an image in George Edwards’s “A Natural History of Uncommon Birds” (1758-64) shows the gawky, baroque dodo, already extinct in the 17th century.<br />Such creatures inspired flights of avian fancy. A 1757 guide to “Japaning”—as the method of “painting on furniture and other objects with resin varnishes” was called—shows imagined birds only a bit more ornate than real ones. A 368-piece dessert service by the Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory (1771-72) is represented by such items as a bowl used to cool wine glasses—as exquisitely luxurious as the fantastical birds baked onto its surface.</td>

After the 2020 election, Mr. Giuliani led a legal team that laid out sprawling and unsupported allegations of a conspiracy between Democratic officials and foreign governments to steal the presidential election for Joe Biden.<br />“These false statements were made to improperly bolster [Giuliani’s] narrative that due to widespread voter fraud, victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen from his client,” the New York appellate division wrote in an order based on the findings of a continuing investigation by its attorney-grievance committee.<br />It is unusual for the appellate division to suspend a lawyer’s license before the grievance committee completes its investigation, ethics lawyers said. The 33-page order said the court acted now because Mr. Giuliani’s conduct threatened the public interest, citing Mr. Giuliani’s “past, persistent and pervasive dissemination of these false statements in the media.”<br />“This is not a situation where the uncontroverted misconduct consisted of only a few isolated incidents,” the court wrote.</td>

They’re employed, as well, to aid the healing of minds or, as we see, to change the life of a child born with a muscle-wasting condition—a girl who would have been confined to a wheelchair by age 10 if it had not been for the services of a patient Great Dane, George, her personal trainer.<br />The girl’s ecstatic mother recalls a doctor saying that her daughter would never be able to ride a bicycle. And here that daughter is at age 13, pedaling merrily along on her two-wheeler.<br />Here, too, is a skillful 10-year-old dog, ministering to a female Air Force veteran who suffers from anxiety so extreme that she’s unable to bring herself to go out for a walk—a problem that will be much diminished thanks to the instincts of her four-legged therapist, who has somehow made his patient feel secure about going outside.<br />In this far-ranging series, we’re shown blood-chilling rescue efforts, none more so than the kind needed for the deadly 2018 Montecito, Calif., mudslide. Where there is chaos and terror, dogs can make their way to survivors (or locate a dead body) as no human could.</td>

      <td>In a story that spans decades, Heidi Ewing’s latest film traces a story of gay love, wrenching loss, illegal immigration and the struggle for success in the U.S.</td>
      <td>When people use the phrase “you can’t go home again,” they usually mean that home—and all it represents—has been changed beyond recognition or swept away by the passage of time. That’s not the case for the heart-stricken hero of “I Carry You With Me,” which is opening in theaters in New York and Los Angeles in advance of its national release next month. A Mexican chef who tries to make a good life for himself in New York, he can’t go home to visit the lover and the son he left 20 years ago because he entered this country illegally and is still undocumented, with no safe path to re-enter the U.S. It’s the wound that won’t heal in this flawed but stirring feature, which mixes documentary techniques with a fictional narrative to retell a true story of love, loss, and a measure of happiness regained.<br />The complex, often confusing narrative begins in 1994, in Puebla, Mexico, where Iván Garcia (Armando Espitia), a young man with outsize dreams, is washing dishes and doing other menial work in a modest restaurant. He has a degree from a culinary institute, but his boss won’t let him set foot in the kitchen and he can’t find a better job elsewhere. Iván’s struggle in a profession for which he feels he has a gift is one track of the story. The other is his passionate attraction to Gerardo Zabaleta (Christian Vazquez), a teacher he meets during a chance encounter in a club. But gay romance is not something to be flaunted in the Mexico of the 1990s: Iván tries to keep his relationship a secret from his estranged wife in a doomed effort to preserve his visitation rights for their primary-school-age son.<br />The director, Heidi Ewing, who wrote the screenplay with Alan Page Arriaga, has a background in documentaries, including the 2006 “Jesus Camp,” which she co-directed with Rachel Grady. Clearly Ms. Ewing sought to convey a sense of epic reality in this new tale of immigration and intertwined fates, and ultimately she does. Some of its strongest elements concern Iván’s perilous journey across the border into the U.S. Southwest, and his lonely existence in New York, eking out a living in still more menial jobs—at a car wash, as a janitor, yet again as a dishwasher, but also working his way up in restaurants, and finally getting, and seizing, his chance to show what he can do as a cook.<br />“The American dream,” he reflects at one point, “happens in slow motion.” But so do many parts of the film, which is burdened with a surfeit of narrative threads and storytelling modes. We see Iván and Gerardo in flashbacks to their childhoods; Gerardo suffers terribly at the hands of a father who sees him as insufficiently masculine. The real-life models for the fictional versions of both men play themselves in the film’s preface and coda. That’s confusing at first, though unexpectedly affecting, and, not incidentally, a good way to tell the story over several decades without the need for often problematic older-age makeup.<br />And some of the dramatic sequences are oddly lacking in immediacy, through no fault of the co-stars, both of whom give beautifully nuanced performances. (Mr. Espitia, in particular, brings a delicate melancholy to his role.) While Ms. Ewing keeps her camera close on the lovers as their relationship deepens, she sometimes holds us at an emotional distance with sparse dialogue and frequent voice-over reminiscences that separate sight from sound to dislocating effect. The result is that many passages play more like a meditation, or a free-form poem. Yet the production, which grew out of the filmmaker’s friendship with the two men, Iván and Gerardo, is so heartfelt, and the material so intrinsically powerful, that “I Carry You With Me” slowly catches up with itself, and lights a fire fueled by food and love. That’s a winning combination in this story, just as it is in real life.</td>

      <td>Judiciary Committee passed the final piece of a six-part package aimed at curbing the dominance of large tech companies</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A House committee approved far-reaching legislation to curb the market dominance of tech giants, raising political alarms for firms including  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google,  Facebook Inc.  and  Amazon.com Inc.<br />The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the “Ending Platform Monopolies Act,” which restricts big tech companies’ ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The measure could make it easier for federal regulators to break up the companies, lawmakers said. The vote on the bill was 21-20.<br />The move leaves the big tech firms—once darlings of Washington—in lawmakers’ crosshairs, despite intensive lobbying efforts. Still, the companies will have multiple opportunities to block or water down the broad legislative package, which must be approved on the House floor and then in the Senate to become law.<br />The package also includes a measure to bar big tech companies from favoring their own products in a range of circumstances on their platforms. Known as the American Choice and Innovation Online Act, it would prohibit big platforms from engaging in conduct that advantages their own products or services, disadvantages other business users, or discriminates among similarly situated business users.<br />Another measure requires that the largest internet platforms make it easier for users to transport their data to other platforms and even communicate with users on other platforms. The bill—known as the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching, or Access, Act—would give the Federal Trade Commission extensive new powers to set individualized standards for the large tech companies.</td>

      <td>Who’s in charge of inflation these days? Or perhaps better stated: Who’s to blame? When Congress engages in deficit spending, it must issue debt to cover the difference between federal budget revenues and expenditures. When the Federal Reserve purchases that Treasury debt, it creates new money to pay for it—and the Fed created trillions in new money during Covid by crediting depository accounts of banks.<br />Now that Covid seems to be receding as an economic threat, what happens to all that potential purchasing power? Who is overseeing monetary policy to ensure that inflation doesn’t undermine economic recovery? Joseph C. Sternberg poses the question: “Is There a Central Banker in the House?” (Political Economics, June 18) and wonders why, with inflation exceeding the Fed’s predictions, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell plays down the risk in his public comments. Delivering price stability is part of the U.S. central bank’s mandate from Congress, after all, yet the Fed remains in “accommodative” monetary mode.<br />It’s time to confront both the fiscal and monetary aspects of inflation: Government policies that cause prices to rise without expanding productive economic output amount to an expropriation of wealth—one that hurts the poor the most.<br />The latest “forward guidance” from Mr. Powell may assuage the fears of market investors who don’t want to see any reduction in the Fed’s monthly bond purchases. But it’s a different story for those struggling to pay rising bills—for groceries, gas, furniture and rent. “Who you gonna believe,” goes the famous line from the Marx Brothers’ “Duck Soup,” “me or your own eyes?”<br />Judy Shelton</td>

This development can certainly be positive, but I fear Mr. Raskin sets himself an easy target when he compares bitcoin with proposed central-bank digital currencies. If implemented, CBDCs are almost certain to be a tool of financial repression, destructive of privacy. Private cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, can be a tool of financial liberation.<br />The way the Salvadoran law is framed, it is unlikely that bitcoin will find widespread adoption. Notably, dollars are still legal tender in El Salvador. Direct, peer-to-peer transactions on the bitcoin network are also too expensive for everyday transactions. Until now, bitcoin in El Salvador has been used via the Strike app. The Salvadoran government has promised to set up an official “wallet” allowing costless transactions, but is it really wise to grant the government direct access to the monetary savings of the people?<br />I agree with Mr. Raskin that freedom in money is a worthy goal, but the Salvadoran law leaves much to be desired.<br />Kristoffer Hansen<br />Leipzig, Germany</td>

Prior to that rule, courts had sometimes found those arrangements to be illegal. Under then-President Donald Trump, the OCC had cited differing court approaches as a reason it wrote the rule.<br />Because the rule was finalized so close to the end of Mr. Trump’s term, Congress was able to revoke it by a simple majority vote in each Democratic-led chamber, under the Congressional Review Act. The Senate approved the true lender rule repeal last month by a 52-47 vote; the House followed Thursday with a 218-208 vote.<br />The Biden administration said it supports the repeal; it takes effect upon the president’s signature.<br />“As we anticipate President Biden signing the resolution, I want to reaffirm the agency’s long-standing position that predatory lending has no place in the federal banking system,” Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu said in a statement.</td>

      <td>Package includes funding for roads, bridges, transit, airports and broadband</td>
      <td>A core bipartisan group of 10 senators reached a deal with the White House on Thursday to spend $973 billion over five years, and $1.2 trillion if continued over eight years, on a package that would fund improvements to roads, bridges, transit, airports and enhanced infrastructure for broadband, water and electric vehicles. It leaves out many of President Biden’s top priorities for “human infrastructure” such as child care, elder care, and education provisions.<br />The bipartisan plan’s authors describe it as a framework, and note that some of the details remain to be ironed out, though they agreed on the major pieces and how to pay for them. Here’s what’s in the agreement, and what comes next.<br />The bipartisan group focused mostly on physical infrastructure, putting off issues like funding long-term care for seniors and child care for a potential Democrats-only budget maneuver later this summer. The plan includes nearly $400 billion in expected baseline transportation funding that Congress must regularly renew, along with $579 billion in new spending. Of the new spending, $312 billion of which would go to transportation projects and $266 billion would go to other infrastructure needs like water systems, broadband, and improving power grids.<br />The transportation section includes $109 billion above-baseline funding for roads and bridges, $49 billion for mass transit, $66 billion for passenger and freight rail, $25 billion for airports, $16 billion for seaports and waterways, and $15 billion for electric-vehicle infrastructure and electric buses. It also includes provisions for infrastructure financing and safety.<br />The other tranche of money dedicates $55 billion for water infrastructure, $65 billion for broadband, and $73 billion for building thousands of miles of new transmission lines intended to speed the transition to renewable energy. There is also $21 billion for environmental remediation of polluted areas and $47 billion for resilience projects to deal with climate change, extreme weather events, and cyberattacks.</td>

The resolution, titled “Building Worker Power at Amazon,” stipulates that the union would “supply all resources necessary” and eventually create a special division to organize workers at the company.<br />“Amazon is changing the nature of work in our country and touches many core Teamster industries and employers,” the union said in the resolution. “Teamsters across North America have been and will continue to stand in solidarity with Amazon workers in their effort to find a true voice on the job.”<br />Amazon didn’t respond to a request for comment on the resolution. In the past, the company has said that a union is unnecessary because its workers already receive the pay and benefits that a union would bargain for.

Between Eureka and Redding, California Route 299’s freshly paved, generously cambered sweepers are like the Porsche Curves at Le Mans that go on for 25 miles. Thank you, California taxpayers.<br />And this car. Marone. While much has been made of the Plaid’s straight-line acceleration—0-60 mph in 1.99 seconds and ¼-mile time of 9.2 seconds, both records for a series-production automobile—not enough has been said about its lateral acceleration, its race car-like roadholding and mechanical grip. Forget planking. Route 299 is the core workout you’ve been looking for.<br />And the tires—custom-compounded Michelin Pilot Cup Sport 4S, on 21-inch wheels—they are so...beautiful.<br />The successor to Tesla’s game-changing electric luxury sedan introduced nine years ago, the new Model S—the Long Range with two motors, the Plaid with three—is in many respects a technical tour de force disguised as last year’s model. The Plaid’s exterior is largely unchanged, said head of design Franz von Holzhausen, except for a few details that, in the force-multiplying world of aerodynamics, make all the difference: a revised front splitter, underbody, and rear diffuser; as well as the decklid spoiler shaped like a cavalry sword.</td>

Officials declined to say how many people were under immediate review, where they could be taken, or how. Mr. Biden said he did not know where the Afghans would be taken.<br />Up to 18,000 Afghans have worked for the U.S. and could be interested in relocating by the time U.S. and international forces leave the country as soon as July under the order by Mr. Biden to withdraw from the country.

      <td>Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today’s world. Read previous columns here.<br />Wall Street wants its workforce back in the office.  Bank of America ,   Morgan Stanley  and  Goldman Sachs  have all let employees know that the time is approaching to exchange pajamas and sweats for less comfortable work garb. Some employees are thrilled at the prospect, but others waved goodbye to the water cooler last year and have no wish to return.<br />Contrary to popular belief, office work is not a beastly invention of the capitalist system. As far back as 3000 B.C, the temple cities of Mesopotamia employed teams of scribes to keep records of official business. The word “office” is an amalgamation of the Latin officium, which meant a position or duty, and ob ficium, literally “toward doing.” Geoffrey Chaucer was the first writer known to use “office” to mean an actual place, in “The Canterbury Tales” in 1395.<br />In the 16th century, the Medicis of Florence built the Uffizi, now famous as a museum, for conducting their commercial and political business (the name means “offices” in Italian). The idea didn’t catch on in Europe, however, until the British began to flex their muscles across the globe. When the Royal Navy outgrew its cramped headquarters, it commissioned a U-shaped building in central London originally known as Ripley Block and later as the Old Admiralty building. Completed in 1726, it is credited with being the U.K.’s first purpose-built office.<br />Three years later, the East India Company began administering its Indian possessions from gleaming new offices in Leadenhall Street. The essayist and critic Charles Lamb joined the East India Company there as a junior clerk in 1792 and stayed until his retirement, but he detested office life, calling it “daylight servitude.” “I always arrive late at the office,” he famously wrote, “but I make up for it by leaving early.”</td>

Typical assignments involve snapping photos, filling out surveys or doing other basic data collection or observational reporting such as counting ATMs or reporting on the price of consumer goods like food.<br />About half of the company’s clients are private businesses seeking commercial information, Premise says. That can involve assignments like gathering market information on the footprint of competitors, scouting locations and other basic, public observational tasks. Premise in recent years has also started working with the U.S. military and foreign governments, marketing the capability of its flexible, global, gig-based workforce to do basic reconnaissance and gauge public opinion.<br />Premise is one of a growing number of companies that straddle the divide between consumer services and government surveillance and rely on the proliferation of mobile phones as a way to turn billions of devices into sensors that gather open-source information useful to government security services around the world.<br />The company says 90% of its work is gauging public sentiment and understanding human geography by paying users to fill out surveys, yielding data that it says has uses for commercial businesses, nonprofits and governments. A smaller number of projects, it says, involve asking users to go out into the world to complete tasks such as taking pictures or walking a predetermined route. Sometimes those tasks involve collecting data on nearby wireless signals or other cellphones, the company said, comparing the practice to how Google and Apple map Wi-Fi networks with phones using their operating systems.</td>

      <td>President Biden meets his Afghan counterpart Friday, and the White House says it is committed to providing Afghanistan “diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian assistance.” That’s cold comfort as emboldened Taliban militants advance across the country.<br />Mr. Biden said in April that U.S. troops would leave Afghanistan by Sept. 11, and coalition forces have been departing faster than expected. Since May the Taliban have taken more than 50 of the country’s roughly 400 districts, a United Nations official said this week. Fighting continues in many districts, which are comparable to American counties.<br />Some 8.5 million Afghans already live under Taliban control, the Long War Journal estimates, with more than 13 million in contested zones. These numbers will keep rising absent a policy reversal from Mr. Biden. Most of the newly captured districts surround provincial capitals, which the group will move on once U.S. and allied forces are gone. The intelligence community believes Kabul could fall six months after the U.S. withdrawal has finished.<br />The offensive has moved into northern Afghanistan, far beyond the Taliban’s traditional strongholds in the south. Brutal fights between militants and Afghan government forces have taken place in the northern Faryab, Balkh and Kunduz provinces. Some two dozen elite Afghan commandos died last week trying to retake a critical district in Faryab. Their calls for air support, which may have saved their lives, were in vain.<br />Many government forces are simply letting territory fall to the Taliban. The government calls these tactical retreats, but they’re leaving expensive weapons and vehicles. Though Afghan forces have had some limited success, they’re increasingly stretched thin without American airpower. The “end forever wars” crowd—which has argued for years that the real problem is America’s presence—has been conspicuously silent about the slow-rolling disaster.</td>

Farmers are incorporating data-driven planting and harvesting systems, while crop buyers like ADM, Cargill and others beam prices to farmers’ phones and automate grain delivery operations.<br />Cybersecurity specialists said the agricultural-technology revolution has created new risks for the farm sector and the U.S. food system. There were 600% more data breaches last year among U.S. agricultural companies compared with 2019, according to risk-consulting firm Kroll LLC, and 2021 is on pace to show another annual increase, according to the firm’s case data. One farm equipment distributor had to notify tens of thousands of customers following a recent network breach, the firm said.</td>

      <td>There is a rule of thumb in data watching that, if you want to understand which way things are trending, you need to watch the revisions. What is happening with capital spending might be a case in point.<br />The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that U.S. manufacturers’ new orders for durable goods rose 2.3% in May from April, lower than the 2.6% gain economists expected. Much of that increase was due to a jump in aircraft orders, which are often lumpy.<br />The element of the report economists home in on to gauge capital spending plans—nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft—slipped 0.1%. Most had expected it to rise.<br />But then there were significant revisions to the April durable-goods figures, which now show that orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 2.7% in April from March, versus an initially reported gain of 2.2%. That marked the largest monthly increase since July of last year, when the U.S. economy was still lurching out of the spring shutdowns.<br />Revised data tend to provide a more complete picture of what is happening. When the Labor Department releases its monthly jobs figures, for example, it has data from about three-quarters of the employers it has surveyed. Over the next two months that response rate is usually over 90%.</td>

      <td>For the past 15 months, the U.S. and Canada have turned away tourists at entry points across the 5,500-mile land border in an effort to contain further spread of Covid-19. In light of progress in both countries on the Covid-19 vaccination front, business groups are now pushing Washington and Ottawa to reopen border crossings—to the fully vaccinated, at least at the start.<br />Such a move “would sustain jobs, boost business confidence and allow more families to reunite,” according to a joint statement issued by six U.S. and Canadian business lobbies, among them the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “It would help facilitate a safe and gradual return to a more normal life.”<br />The U.S. and the U.K. have agreed to open up travel between the two trans-Atlantic allies as soon as possible. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he spoke with President Biden at the margins of the Group of Seven leaders’ summit in England about reopening the border. Patience is wearing thin on both sides of the border. “We’re left scratching our heads right now as to what’s the plan,” said Mark Agnew, vice president of policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.<br />Canada and the U.S. agreed to extend the ban on nonessential travel via the U.S.-Canada land border until July 21, once the current 30-day prohibition expires at midnight on Monday.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier in June downgraded its warning about travel to Canada by one level, from “very high” to “high,” coinciding with a steep drop in Covid-19 cases in Canada after a destabilizing third wave of infections. The third wave prompted authorities in Canada to impose strict economic and social-distancing restrictions. However, nearly all regions across Canada have started to relax some of the restrictions, based on vaccination rates—two-thirds of the population have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine—and a sharp drop in infections, from a peak during the third wave of nearly 9,000 new cases a day to less than 1,000 as of June 23.</td>

      <td>No one lines up for Windows updates anymore. But the storied operating system still has an important role to play in  Microsoft ’s  expanding business.<br />The software titan’s formal unveiling of Windows 11 on Thursday comes more than six years after the last major update to the ubiquitous PC operating system. That is the longest Microsoft has gone between such revisions, though frequency hasn’t always been a sign of quality. The widely panned Windows Me and Vista versions were barely on the market for two years before Microsoft pushed out replacements.<br />But even strong Windows offerings don’t carry the same weight these days. Smartphones and tablets that run on different operating systems have expanded the computing market significantly. And Microsoft’s own pivot to the cloud has reshaped its business model.<br />When the company pulled out all the marketing stops to launch Windows 95—a campaign that included buying an entire print run of the London Times and paying big for the Rolling Stones “Start Me Up” hit—about 28% of Microsoft’s total revenue came from licensing its operating system to PC makers. Analysts now estimate that contribution to be about 8% of projected revenue for the company’s fiscal year ending this month, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.<br />Still, Windows is a key part of Microsoft’s ecosystem. Despite the popularity of mobile devices, personal computers remain the workhorse of the working world. And the vast bulk of those are running on Microsoft’s platform. Windows powered 83% of PC devices sold last year, according to Gartner. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at the company’s Build conference last month that the current Windows 10 version alone has more than 1.3 billion users.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration has issued a monthlong extension of a moratorium, through July, on the eviction of tenants who have fallen behind on their rent during the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.<br />An extension is needed to prevent a wave of evictions before states and local governments can distribute about $47 billion of rental assistance authorized by Congress to cover unpaid back rent, administration officials said. Progress has been slow.<br />The CDC said the move is intended to be the final extension of the moratorium.<br />It comes as the Supreme Court is weighing an emergency request by landlords and real-estate companies to clear the way for evictions after a federal judge in Washington ruled last month that the moratorium was legally unsupportable. The judge who issued that ruling stayed the effect of the decision while litigation continues.<br />The CDC moratorium, which originated from an executive order signed by then-President Donald Trump, shields tenants who have missed monthly rent payments from being forced out of their homes if they declare financial hardship. They still owe the back rent.</td>

      <td>Microsoft Corp.  on Thursday unveiled an overhaul of its Windows operating system designed to update the software that long ruled the PC market for an era when the use of apps on smartphones and tablets increasingly dominate people’s interaction with technology.<br />Windows 11, the product’s first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies’ platforms, including the Android mobile software developed by Google. The new Windows will feature an app store that collaborates with  Amazon . com Inc.—which operates its own Android app store—and will let people use their PC with the easy interface they have become familiar with on their smartphones.<br />In addition to Windows-based apps, users will be able to choose from Android apps Amazon offers to install on their PCs. Amazon offers hundreds of thousands of such apps, including for TikTok, the popular video-sharing site, and ride-hailing service  Uber Technologies Inc.  The partnership would make such apps that have become more central to people’s lives easily accessible on their PC screens.<br />With the new digital storefront, Microsoft is trying to show itself as a fairer place for developers to distribute their apps, doubling down on its battle with  Apple Inc.  over fees. Apple maintains tight control over the apps it allows users to install on their iPhones. Microsoft has argued that behavior is anticompetitive and argued for users to have more choice.<br />“Windows has a role to play as the most open of ecosystems today that plays nicely with the others,” Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in an interview.</td>

      <td>After two years of plenty for pork producers—and pain for pork lovers—China’s supply crunch has finally eased</td>
      <td>Prices of everything seem to be going up this year. Pork prices in China are doing the opposite as a different sort of health crisis eases. That’s tough news for the global pork industry, but a welcome respite for pork buyers everywhere.<br />Prices of pork in China have halved since January: a big change after about two years of surging prices due to an African swine fever outbreak, which saw the country’s pig population fall more than 40%. There was a renewed flare-up in early 2021 but that has since subsided. Minor outbreaks still happen from time to time, but the overall situation has improved markedly compared with 2019.<br />This year’s reversal seems like a classic case of “the cure for high prices is high prices”: Production and imports in the past year have both increased to capture outsize profits. China’s pig herd grew 23.5% year on year in May, according to the government. Imports in 2020 doubled from a year earlier. The outbreak earlier this year also caused some farmers to cull their herds earlier, bringing forward pork supply.<br />Farmers have also been growing fatter pigs. Even though they usually sell at worse prices per kilogram than the leaner ones, the increase in pork prices had justified extra feeding costs. Goldman Sachs says oversize hogs heavier than 150 kilograms (about 331 pounds)—compared with usual size of 110 kilograms—contributed more than 30% of output in April and May. As prices started to collapse, some farmers also rushed to sell, leading to a downward spiral.<br />All this may have some ripple effect on global prices. Imports will likely slow as importers are unlikely to make money in the current market. Pan Chenjun, a senior analyst at Rabobank, expects China’s pork imports to drop 10% to 30% from 2020 levels. China made up about half of global pork imports in 2020.</td>

She also told Politico she didn’t think the former president was going to be “in the picture” when it came to the party’s future because he had “fallen so far.”<br />Ms. Haley has since softened her tone, telling reporters in April that she won’t embark on a 2024 White House bid if Mr. Trump decides to run again himself.

      <td>This streamlined recipe eliminates the mess and fuss of rolling out and cutting individual biscuits. Bake that tender, flaky layer all in one step and get to the sweet payoff faster.</td>
      <td>WHAT’S NOT TO LOVE about strawberry shortcake? It’s a nostalgic crowd-pleaser, from the hot, flaky biscuit to the clouds of cold whipped cream and the ruby strawberries that tumble off and onto the plate, ready to be scooped back into the mix.<br />It’s an easy and quick dessert to make, too, except for one step: the rolling and cutting of the biscuit dough, which inevitably leads to sticky, floury hands and a countertop to match. And so I set about eliminating that step without forgoing a tender biscuit worthy of its over-the-top toppings. This recipe produces a single 8-by-8-inch biscuit layer baked in a square baking dish. You can transfer it to a cutting board and cut it in 6 squares, or you can slice it in half horizontally and make a big shortcake sandwich with a filling of whipped cream and strawberries. An individual biscuit square can also be placed at an angle over each serving, with all the panache of a tilted beret.<br />It’s hard to argue with the purity of the biscuit-cream-berry trio, and I am loath to mess with the first strawberry shortcake of the season, but after a few weeks I tend to start riffing. Sometimes I add a pinch of cardamom and a spoonful or two of rose water to the cream, or I might toss the berries in some of that rose water or a little limoncello, Kirsch or crème de cassis. Maybe I’ll toss in the zest of a lemon or a few mint leaves, sliced in fine slivers. Or perhaps I’ll infuse the cream with lemon verbena leaves before I whip it. Nothing radical—it’s really just about adding subtle layers of flavor. And then, suddenly, I’ll realize that the summer days are growing shorter and even the northern strawberries have peaked. To celebrate the last strawberries of the season, I return to the simple pleasure of biscuit, cream and berry.<br />You can always swap in other fruits. Raspberries, blueberries and blackberries have their merits, served individually or mixed up in a colorful jumble. And peeled slices of peach and nectarine make a late-summer beauty of a shortcake. For a tropical version, stir a little white rum and lime zest into a mixture of half coconut cream and half heavy cream, then whip to soft peaks. Layer with kiwi, mango, coconut and pineapple. If your fruit isn’t quite as fragrant as you’d like, roast it in a hot oven for 10 minutes to concentrate its flavor, then let it come to room temperature. Whatever you do, don’t let summer pass without making at least one classic strawberry shortcake. With a recipe this easy, there’s really no reason not to.<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

      <td>They’re out of power in Washington, but in state capitals they can show they have real solutions.</td>
      <td>With the Supreme Court having (unsurprisingly) upheld ObamaCare again, Republicans are playing defense on health policy in Washington. Advancing conservative health-policy principles at the state level—where they have majority control in 30 legislatures—allows Republicans to advance federalism while also strengthening consumer-based healthcare. While Democrats fight to shift costs to taxpayers and expand government programs, state Republicans can show that a better approach is to reduce costs and empower consumers. Here are some specific policies they can champion and expand:<br />• Require more price transparency. States can build on the Trump administration’s rules requiring price transparency for health plans and hospitals by including more providers, including physicians; beefing up enforcement to ensure compliance; and compiling data online in a format that allows for easy comparisons. At least nine states have built price-comparison websites for consumers, and many have or are building all-payer claims databases for payers and employers. Empowering consumers with more price and quality information is increasingly important as more patients shop for healthcare with higher deductibles and other forms of cost-sharing. New Hampshire started posting prices for imaging scans in 2007 and has seen costs reduced for consumers and insurers.<br />Employers can use the information to set reference prices for procedures, as California does for state employees, allowing comparison shopping and creating incentives for providers to become more efficient. Price transparency also increases pressure on intermediaries like health plans, third-party administrators, and pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate more effectively on behalf of their customers and makes it harder for them to profit despite higher health inflation from misaligned incentives.<br />• Expand scopes of practice, repeal certificate-of-need requirements, and promote cross-border licensing. Legal scopes of practice should be expanded so that doctors, nurses, pharmacists, therapists and other professionals can provide services up to their training and competence. What particular providers are currently allowed to do varies by state, with many restrictions unsupported by evidence of adverse outcomes. Many restrictions are dated and intentionally difficult to update to reflect advances in training, technology and research.<br />Certificates of need require government permission before new facilities can be built, so that such decisions are based on politics rather than market demand. New Hampshire repealed its certificate-of-need program in 2016, and Florida partly did so in 2019. State-specific licensing requirements have impeded the ability of providers, especially in mental health, to care for patients remotely. As Covid expedited federal payment reforms to encourage telehealth, states should enact automatic reciprocal licensing and other arrangements to allow providers to treat patients across state lines. Many states joined interstate compacts and temporarily eased regulations during the pandemic. These provisions should be broadened and made permanent.</td>

The Afghan Sikh community has existed since Sikhism’s founder, Guru Nanak, traveled to Afghanistan during the 16th century to spread his philosophies.

This important historical material helps explain how religions spread far outside Afghanistan. For example, figurines of the Hindu goddess Durga found within a Buddhist complex in Ghazni, Afghanistan, point toward early incorporation of the Hindu pantheon in early Central Asian Buddhist tradition.<br />Under previous Taliban rule, many non-Islamic art pieces were smashed in accordance with decrees against representations of human form ostensibly forbidden by Islam. Many more were trafficked in an illegal art trade, which could have been used to fund terrorism. Unless religious art preservation is worked into the security agreements for a postwithdrawal from Afghanistan, religious minority artwork remains in jeopardy. Even then, the Taliban can’t be trusted.<br />Most famously, the Bamiyan Buddhas were destroyed in March 2001. At the time, a Taliban envoy characterized the bombing of this Unesco World Heritage Site as a demonstration against the West’s misappropriated concern: “When your children are dying in front of you, then you don’t care about a piece of art.” There’s no reason to believe the group has changed.</td>

      <td>The New York City Council is considering a legislative package aimed at significantly regulating the food-delivery app industry, including permanently limiting fees that operators like Grubhub and Uber Eats can charge restaurants.<br />In a bid to help the city’s struggling restaurant industry survive the Covid-19 pandemic, the council last year passed legislation temporarily prohibiting third-party food-delivery services from charging eateries more than 15% per delivery order and more than 5% for marketing and other nondelivery fees.<br />However, the combined 20% cap is set to expire Aug. 17. It only covers the first 90 days after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo allowed indoor dining to reopen May 19 at full capacity statewide.<br />Some small restaurant operators say the app fees typically can run them a combined 30% or more of what they take in on every order.<br />A new bill sponsored by Councilman Francisco Moya, a Queens Democrat, would make the cap permanent. Violators would face up to $1,000 a day in fines per restaurant, the same penalty covered under the temporary law.</td>

      <td>Beneath the surface of a spat between Boeing and Comac, a raft of U.S. companies are key suppliers of China’s upstart plane maker</td>
      <td>The West may appear ready to bring the geopolitical hammer down on China’s aerospace ambition, but there are a lot of corporate interests pushing to make that strike decidedly less deadly.<br />As of last week, the U.S. and the European Union have agreed to end a 17-year trade feud over planes and to stop providing development incentives that “could harm the other side.” This is somewhat vague, but the backdrop of the accord isn’t: Both parties want to present a united front against China.<br />The C919, a narrow-body jet produced by Chinese state-owned company Comac, is scheduled to enter service this year. While unable to compete with the  Boeing  737 MAX and the  Airbus  A320neo in international markets, it is a key part of Beijing’s plans to step up advanced manufacturing in the country over the next four years. This ensures that all major Chinese airlines—also government owned—will fly it, even though it likely contravenes World Trade Organization rules. Beijing is pulling other levers too: So far, it hasn’t recertified the MAX.<br />The U.S. and Europe rightly worry about Comac breaking their plane duopoly, say in 20 years’ time. China has proven it can catch up in myriad industries like cars, trains and digital technology. Last week’s Euro-American agreement calls for joint action against the “non-market practices of third parties,” including China’s practice of inviting in foreign investors only to copy their technology.<br />Yet the West can in fact already torpedo China’s aircraft industry. It just chooses not to.</td>

      <td>A new breed of vacation-rental booking sites sets out to provide stylish, welcoming accommodations for their communities</td>
      <td>JAMIE DEKLIN has a long history of booking short-term rentals. The actor learned the ins and outs while touring with a Broadway show. “I traveled with two dogs, so I’d check Vrbo for places allowing them,” she said. Later, after she and her husband had children, their priorities changed. They had no problem finding chic vacation homes to rent, but ones with highchairs, child-proofed rooms and unbreakable dinnerware were much tougher to come by. Seven years ago, Kid & Coe, a family-friendly travel platform based out of New York, began offering homes and hotels where parents and kids could unwind in comfortable, kid-appropriate accommodations. “They understand the reality of traveling with children,” said Ms. Deklin.<br />Kid & Coe is one of a new breed of short-term rental sites targeting travelers who have found that established sites like  Airbnb  don’t always reflect their needs. Niche rental companies such as Noirbnb (Black and ethnically diverse travelers), Golightly (women-only hosts) and Fabstayz (LGBT) each promise an open-arms welcome to those who fear a cool reception or even rejection because of skin color, gender identity or sexual orientation. While each company’s client focus differs, these platforms share a mission—to create comfortable house-sharing options for their respective communities.<br />“We realized discrimination was a problem...and wanted to offer a solution,” said Stefan Grant, who created Noirbnb in 2016 after neighbors called the police on him at an Atlanta Airbnb the year before and his social media posts about it went viral. Ultimately, he said, creating a community of like-minded hosts and guests “is what it is about.” He’s careful to be inclusive: “People of all walks of life come to us,” said Mr. Grant. “A misconception is that Noirbnb is...Black people only. We welcome people of all races, ethnicities and genders.”<br />Hospitality is the bottom line, stressed Robert Geller, founder of FabStayz, an LGBT-focused travel platform based in Florida. “Safety looks different to an LGBT traveler,” he said. An experienced traveler and former Airbnb Superhost, Mr. Geller knows that being confronted with “a coming-out experience” upon arrival at a rental triggers stress. “We wanted to eliminate that—travel is nerve-racking enough.”<br />Like Noirbnb and FabStayz, the Austin, Texas-based Golightly has “a mission of safety” as its motto. “I discovered some people like me feel safer in a trusted network,” said founder Victoria O’Connell, a longtime short-term rental host whose London flat was vandalized by a man who created a fake profile to rent it for a party. As Ms. O’Connell sees it, the problem lies in renting from total strangers. “The whole system is anonymous; you’re searching through thousands of sites without really knowing who you’re renting from or to,” said Ms. O’Connell, who created the invitation-only, female home-sharing and rental travel club inspired by all-female co-working spaces. Those already in the network recommend new members, but applications are also accepted. Personal interactions are key. “I want people to know each other—that’s an element of protection,” said Ms. O’Connell. The formula seems to be working: After a slow start in January 2020 because of the pandemic, Golightly now has listings in 85 countries.</td>

      <td>Customers, suppliers, employees, investors and communities can have competing interests. And executives can’t afford to pay attention to everyone</td>
      <td>“Stakeholder capitalism” has a lovely ring to it—the idea that leaders no longer focus exclusively on shareholder value, but instead run companies for the benefit of all stakeholders: customers, suppliers, employees, investors and communities.<br />But if you’re a corporate leader, it inevitably leads to a difficult question: How do you actually do it?<br />After all, calls to “balance” stakeholder interests sound nice, but in the end are impractical at best and disingenuous at worst. At some point, a company leader has to choose whom to offend and whom to listen to. Do you pay attention to the employees arguing that your business should no longer accept oil companies as customers? Or to the investors who are pressing you to cut off key suppliers on human-rights grounds? Or to the community leaders who are lobbying you to increase your wages above market levels?<br />Because while there’s a risk to having stakeholders say you’re ignoring them, there is a bigger risk saying yes yes yes to people, and then have them accuse you of being hypocritical.<br />Leaving aside the pros and cons of this new vision of capitalism, let’s assume you’re a business leader who believes that the world has changed and that it makes sense to pay attention to broader interests and voices. Here is some guidance on how to navigate that difficult and confusing terrain.</td>

The bill itself was almost certain to fail, given it would require 60 votes—at least 10 from Republicans—to pass, and no Republican had signaled support. But Mr. Schumer wanted to proceed anyway to show that Democrats were united behind it and that its failure would be at Republican hands.</td>

      <td>On a summer evening in 1953, in a small apartment on Coney Island, the Putnam family sits anxiously in front of a flickering black-and-white screen. “The only signs of life squawk and jitter inside the massive console TV,” Simon Putnam reports. He and his mother have been watching all day and now his father has joined the vigil. “Networks have been interrupting the regular programming with news of the execution, which, without a miracle, will happen tonight at Sing Sing,” Simon explains. “It’s like New Year’s Eve in Time Square: the countdown to the ball drop.”<br />Soon Julius and Ethel Rosenberg will die in the electric chair. President Eisenhower, in a letter read by a reporter, declares that, “the abominable act of treason committed by these Communist traitors has immeasurably increased the chances of nuclear annihilation.” The Death House matron, briefly interviewed, says, on the other hand, that “Ethel was . . . one of the kindest, sweetest, gentlest human beings I ever met.” The two Rosenberg children, shepherded by a lawyer, are filmed entering the prison. A rabbi arrives, then an electrician, and then it’s over. Quickly for Julius, but slowly for Ethel. “Thousands are weeping in Union Square, in San Francisco, London, and Paris,” Simon observes. “But in Coney Island, it’s a regular fun Friday night.” Horrified, he still goes out to ride the amusement park’s Cyclone.<br />Francine Prose’s novel “The Vixen” opens with this tense moment, which instantly sets both mood and tempo. Like instruments in a string quartet, the scene’s syncopated dialogue and vivid description play off each other, seamlessly, rhythmically, as the narrative shifts back and forth, from the execution coverage to the puerile TV sitcoms, and from the sardonic comments of Simon’s parents to his own confused sense of things. “Who am I, and what am I doing in this place where they have learned to live without me?” he wonders. “We hardly recognize each other: the boy who left for college, the son who returned, the mother and father still here.”<br />Themselves the children of Jewish immigrants, Simon’s parents knew the Rosenbergs well. His mother and Ethel were tenement neighbors and childhood friends. And now one is witnessing the other’s death. “ ‘Maybe the rabbi can give her some peace,’ says Mom. ‘Forty-five minutes,’ says Dad. ‘The rabbi better talk fast.’ ” Besides, Simon’s father observes, “Jewish Communists don’t think they’re Jews until Stalin kills them.”<br />Cold War paranoia and McCarthy-era persecution, both notoriously epitomized by the Rosenberg case, are the persistent bass notes in Ms. Prose’s novel, and there are inescapable echoes, therefore, of Philip Roth’s American Trilogy and in particular of his 1998 novel “I Married a Communist.” (The Rosenberg case, we recall, also inspired E.L. Doctorow’s “The Book of Daniel” (1971) and Robert Coover’s “The Public Burning” (1977), along with numerous nonfiction investigations.)</td>

      <td>AUSTIN, Texas—A freeway overpass shaded Elizabeth Contreras’s tent from the hot Texas sun, five years into a stretch of on-and-off homelessness that began when her husband left her, she said. Austin Police Officer Rosie Perez stopped by the tent last week with a written warning for Ms. Contreras: Within weeks, she would need to be gone.<br />Police officers are beginning to enforce new city and statewide bans on public camping, after a two-year battle over Austin homeless policies. Amid a growth boom that accelerated the city’s affordability crisis, homelessness has increased and local shelters are mostly full.<br />“You guys are asking ‘Where do I go?’ and I don’t have an answer for you,” Ms. Perez told Ms. Contreras. “But I know the process is going to continue.”<br />Cities nationwide are grappling with how to respond to homelessness after the coronavirus pandemic. This rapidly growing city of nearly 1 million has an estimated 3,160 people experiencing homelessness, according to an estimate by the Ending Community Homelessness Coalition, a nonprofit that serves as the lead agency for homeless services in the Austin area. While that is a small number compared with many West Coast cities, the issue gained visibility after a change to city policies led homeless encampments to spread across downtown Austin and popular walking and biking paths.<br />Austin City Council members voted in 2019 to rescind a longtime city ban on sitting or sleeping in public, following testimony, mostly from homeless people and advocates, on its impact. One man spoke of a friend who had been killed when, sleeping in a tunnel to keep from being cited, she was swept away in a flood. Others said citations made it more difficult to work out of homelessness.</td>

He’s planning to start with tennis star Andy Murray’s 2013 Wimbledon win.<br />“I wouldn’t say the art world has been overly welcoming,” Mr. Winkelman said. “Everyone is taking a cautious approach toward me and NFTs, and I get it because it’s all happened so fast.”<br />Mr. Winkelmann’s blistering rise and bumpy aftermath echoes the entire NFT art phenomenon, which started gaining traction last fall as digital artists realized they could attach data already being used to track cryptocurrency onto their own pixelated images and sell one-of-a-kind work the way painters sell original canvases.<br />Immediately following Christie’s sale of Mr. Winkelmann’s “Everydays: The First 5,000 Days,” a gold-rush atmosphere spread across the art market, with dozens of artists and galleries clamoring to sell NFT art. The early fever appears to have subsided, though pioneering and seminal NFT artworks created by digital artists including Pak, Mad Dog Jones and FEWOCiOUS continue to sell at auction houses such as Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips for record sums.</td>

      <td>LINCOLN, Neb.—Through the floor-to-ceiling windows in Nebraska athletic director Bill Moos’s office in Memorial Stadium, you can hear heavy machinery ripping up a sidewalk to make room for a new $155 million indoor training facility. But that’s not the biggest change to campus Moos will oversee this year.<br />The university is angling hard to be at the front of the pack in persuading recruits it can help them take advantage of a new era of compensation for college athletes that is dawning.<br />Nebraska will be among the first states to permit college athletes to make money from their name, image and likeness. The state’s law does not take effect until July 1, 2023, but allows universities to give their athletes the right to monetize their names before then, at the school’s discretion.<br />Moos is using his discretion to start immediately. Laws in at least six states will take effect on July 1 that allow athletes to make money from their name, image and likeness, beginning a new era of compensation for college athletes.<br />The state moves come just after a landmark Supreme Court decision this week in which justices unanimously ruled that the NCAA unlawfully limited schools from competing for player talent by offering better benefits, to the detriment of college athletes.</td>

New restrictions would, for example, curb private lessons during school holidays, the people said.<br />Separately, Beijing policy makers are discussing measures to tamp down real estate frenzies that have sprung up in desirable school districts in China’s wealthy cities, adding educational anxieties to a housing market that many officials fear is overheated, according to two of the people.<br />Taken together, the policies are intended to blunt two trends seen as driving up the perceived cost of education for many Chinese families, which is in turn regarded as an obstacle discouraging couples from having more children.<br />Decades of birth restrictions have led many Chinese families to invest their hopes—and much of their savings—into improving their children’s prospects. As incomes rise, that has fueled an arms race on private tutoring classes as more students compete for scarce placements at top schools.</td>

Some firms took large government grants to help them make up for losses tied to the pandemic and for treating Covid-19 patients.<br />The financial turmoil of the past year in some respects has added to the urgency of changes that already were under way at publicly traded hospital operators. Many have been focused on boosting margins by shifting services to lower-cost outpatient centers, selling off less-profitable assets and cutting costs from their businesses.<br />These efforts are winning support from investors. They have helped the shares of big hospital operators such as  Tenet Healthcare Corp.  and  Community Health Systems Inc.  significantly outperform the broader market this year. Tenet is up around 70% year-to-date while the shares of Community Health Systems have more than doubled so far in 2021.  HCA Healthcare Inc.  has also jumped.<br />What began as a recovery rally for hospital stocks could now prove to be longer lasting, say analysts and industry investors.

Claims are down sharply from the depths of the Covid-19-induced downturn during 2020, and are hovering at levels half of what they were in January this year. Weekly claims totals are down more than 40% from the 742,000 total posted the week ended April 3.<br />While initial claims remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, their steady decline, along with a pickup in hiring, a declining unemployment rate and optimistic consumer sentiment, points to gains for the U.S. labor market.<br />“The overall trend is in the right direction,” said Jordan van Rijn, senior economist at the Credit Union National Association. “Right now, there’s a lot of demand for labor out there and it’s the workers that are a little more in the driver’s seat,” he added.</td>

FedEx resumed service to some customers this week. While a surge in e-commerce spending during the Covid-19 pandemic has strained shipping companies of all sorts, FedEx has lagged behind rivals in keeping deliveries on time this year.<br />A FedEx spokeswoman said the cuts were “designed to minimize network disruptions and balance our capacity and demand to avoid backlogs across the country—particularly in the most capacity-constrained Freight service centers.” The company is due to report quarterly financial results after the market closes Thursday.<br />Colorado-based Diversified Innovative Products Co., a family-run maker of disposable ink pans for printing presses, had an order waiting on its loading dock for a FedEx pickup that never happened.<br />“There was no correspondence sent, and we were notified the day that shipping ceased via a phone call from our rep,” said Theron Johnson, president of the company.

      <td>As the television host leaves TBS, here’s how his comedy has evolved over 28 years</td>
      <td>Conan O’Brien’s farewell to late-night TV has reached its finale. His show “Conan” has been chockablock with his famous friends and staff members trotting out fan-favorite characters in recent weeks. The last episode, set to air Thursday night, will feature Jack Black and surprise guests.<br />“Then we will get a drink somewhere and feel weird about the fact that we’d been doing this for 28 years,” executive producer Jeff Ross said Wednesday, just before the final taping began at the Los Angeles club Largo, where “Conan” relocated after the pandemic displaced the show from its studio set.<br />“Conan” has been on cable channel TBS since 2010, but this send-off is effectively for Mr. O’Brien’s entire run as a late-night host, which started in 1993 and included two previous shows on NBC. Next he’ll head off to streaming with a new weekly variety show for HBO Max (which he recently mocked in a bit comparing HBO Max’s business model to a pyramid scheme). He has also been pulled away from traditional TV by other projects from his Team Coco production company, including his long-form interview podcast “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend.”<br />In 2019, Mr. O’Brien dispensed with his host’s desk and trimmed “Conan” to fit a 30-minute time slot. Despite the many changes he has weathered on the air, the host’s style has remained consistent—a balance of relentless self-deprecation and faux demagoguery. He turned his shows into a vehicle for surreal silliness, and influenced a rising generation of comedians who watched him. As former “Saturday Night Live” star Bill Hader said when he appeared on Mr. O’Brien’s show this week, “It was the first thing in comedy that was mine. It was the first thing that, like, my parents didn’t understand.”<br />Among countless sketches on the 4,368 episodes that Mr. O’Brien and his collaborators produced, here are five examples that mark the evolution of his late-night run:</td>

He said the pilot program, which will run for four years, was a start.<br />“Our plan is to go big on this,” he said. “And we assume the private sector is going to step up and do its part.”</td>

      <td>Former Philippines President Benigno Aquino III, who belonged to one of the country’s most prominent political families and during his term pushed back against China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea, died on Thursday in Manila. He was 61 years old.<br />The cause of his death wasn’t revealed. Tributes to the former leader, popularly known as “Noynoy,” poured out on social media on Thursday and a spokesman for current President Rodrigo Duterte offered condolences on behalf of the government.<br />“We’re grateful to the former president for his contributions and services to the country. Rest in peace, Mr. President,” the spokesman said.<br />Mr. Aquino served as Philippine president from 2010 to 2016. His administration brought an unprecedented arbitration case challenging Beijing’s claim to historic and economic rights in the South China Sea. The tribunal at The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague held in a landmark 2016 decision that China’s claim had no legal basis.<br />Although China rejected the outcome, the decision constitutes a critical document of international law on the strategically important waterway. It is frequently cited by other governments, including the U.S., in opposing China’s actions in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built and militarized artificial islands. Mr. Aquino’s government filed the case after a 2012 standoff between the Philippine Navy and Chinese fishing vessels in which Manila effectively lost control of an outcrop called the Scarborough Shoal.</td>

Decades of denuclearization talks, economic sanctions and diplomacy have done little to slow Pyongyang’s advance to becoming a self-declared nuclear state.<br />One of the world’s poorest and most-isolated countries, North Korea has managed to stay high on Washington’s list of foreign-policy priorities for years. It spends more on its military, as a ratio of gross domestic product, than any other of the 170 countries tracked by the U.S. State Department.<br />Pyongyang developed its weapons program brazenly, flouting sanctions and breaking promises to halt nuclear production. In 2003 it withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the main global commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.<br />At 2018’s Singapore summit with then-President Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un greatly boosted his global legitimacy by becoming the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting U.S. leader. In 2017 Pyongyang had ratcheted up tensions with the U.S. to their highest level in years by conducting its sixth nuclear test and firing off three intercontinental ballistic missiles—the last of them showing the range to strike anywhere in the U.S.<br />The U.S. Army in July 2020 said North Korea may now have 20 to 60 nuclear bombs and the ability to manufacture six new bombs each year. In October, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic-missile programs remain “a serious threat to the security and stability of the region and the world.”</td>

      <td>Plan imposes import restrictions and other measures on several companies in Xinjiang involved in silicon production</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration plans to broaden its campaign against the use of forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region by imposing penalties on some companies that produce raw materials used to make solar panels, according to people familiar with the plans.<br />Under the plan, to be announced Thursday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection would bar imports of metallurgical-grade silicon mined by Hoshine Silicon Industry (Shanshan) Co., as well as products made from it, unless the company can prove the material isn’t produced with forced labor, these people said.<br />The Commerce Department would add Hoshine and four others involved in silicon production to its entity list, which requires U.S. companies to get a license to sell them products or technology; such licenses are rarely granted. The Labor Department would add polysilicon made in China to its list of products made by forced labor.<br />The actions are likely to be largely symbolic. They would reinforce the administration’s concern about human rights in Xinjiang, where the U.S. says China is engaged in genocide against the region’s Uyghur population. The U.S. has already banned imports of cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang, where Uyghurs and members of other largely Muslim ethnic groups have been rounded up in detention centers.<br />The new actions are unlikely to hobble China’s solar industry or make it difficult for U.S. businesses to build or sell solar panels, though they will have to ensure the materials they import comply with the order.</td>

      <td>An Indigenous community in western Canada said it found hundreds of unmarked graves near a former boarding school less than a month after a similar discovery shocked the country and reignited a nationwide discussion about Canada’s treatment of Indigenous people.<br />The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, issued a statement that said it would provide more details about the discovery during a Thursday press conference alongside the Cowessess First Nation, which is located about a hundred miles east of Regina. It didn’t specify how many graves had been found but called the discovery “the most significantly substantial” so far in the country.<br />The announcement comes several weeks after the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation near Kamloops, British Columbia, said it had discovered the remains of 215 children in the area of a former government-funded boarding school. The discovery sparked calls to search for more unmarked graves at the sites of some of the roughly 150 former residential schools across Canada.<br />Canada’s residential school system operated for more than a century and separated an estimated 150,000 Indigenous children from their families. Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued a report on the system in 2015 that said the practice of sending Indigenous children to boarding schools, often by force or coercion, where they were forced to abandon their culture and language, amounted to cultural genocide.<br />An estimated 4,100 children died of disease or by accident while in the system, according to updated figures from the Commission’s report, but some Indigenous leaders believe the number could be significantly higher. Murray Sinclair, a former judge and senator who led the commission and who is Indigenous, has said he believes the total death toll could be in the range of 15,000 to 25,000, a number he arrived at by extrapolating from the number of remains found in Kamloops.</td>

      <td>Britney Spears broke her long silence about the legal arrangement that has left her largely without control over her finances for more than a decade.<br />“I’m not happy. I can’t sleep,” Ms. Spears said Wednesday in a court hearing. “I’m so angry, it’s insane.”<br />Speaking before a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, Ms. Spears, 39, railed against her father and lambasted the 13-year-old conservatorship that gives him power over her estimated $50 million-plus fortune.<br />“I truly believe this conservatorship is abusive,” Ms. Spears said in a profanity-laced speech, her voice anguished. It is “doing me way more harm than good,” she added. “I desire to have a life.”<br />Ms. Spears said she wants the conservatorship to end without an evaluation of her mental health, something the judge could require.</td>

      <td>BuzzFeed Inc. is close to a deal to go public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, according to people familiar with the situation, part of a plan to consolidate with other players in digital media.<br />BuzzFeed founder and Chief Executive Officer Jonah Peretti could announce a deal with 890 5th Avenue Partners Inc.—a blank-check company named after the headquarters of Marvel’s Avengers superheroes and founded by investor Adam Rothstein—as early as this week, the people said.<br />The merger deal would generate capital to pursue additional acquisitions, including Complex Networks, a digital publisher that specializes in streetwear, music and pop culture. BuzzFeed is vying for greater scale to better compete for online ad dollars with tech giants such as  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google,  Amazon . com Inc. and  Facebook Inc.<br />The Information earlier reported on BuzzFeed’s plans to buy rivals, including Complex Networks, as a public company.<br />The deal to take BuzzFeed public marks a turning point for Mr. Peretti, a onetime schoolteacher who parlayed his affinity for stunts that went viral on the internet into a winding career as a digital-media entrepreneur. The 47-year-old executive helped found HuffPost alongside Arianna Huffington in 2005 and began work on BuzzFeed in a small workspace in New York’s Chinatown neighborhood in 2006.</td>

Other top content executives will oversee portions of Paramount+ programming relevant to their areas of specialty, from music to reality TV.<br />Several big media companies, including Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal,  Walt Disney Co.  and  AT&T Inc.’s  WarnerMedia, have reorganized their ranks to give priority to streaming, which has rapidly become the core business priority across the industry. Most companies want to have a top executive who ensures streaming service will get a healthy share of the top TV and movie programming under development.<br />ViacomCBS rolled out its subscription Paramount+ service in the U.S. in March, and competes in a crowded field with incumbents like  Netflix Inc.  and  Amazon.com Inc.  and newcomers such as Disney+.<br />Under the company’s reorganization plan, CBS Chief Executive Officer and President George Cheeks will also assume the role of chief content officer of news and sports at Paramount+. Meanwhile, Paramount Pictures Chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulos will serve as the content head of movies on the platform.</td>

      <td>Revolutionary America is remembered ﬁrst as a theater of war. But it was also a forum for conversations about the founding of a nation.</td>
      <td>After 40 long days and nights of being tossed on the rough seas, on Dec. 27, 1760, the merchant vessel Racehorse finally landed in Boston. Along with its trans-Atlantic cargo came news from Britain: George II was dead. His 22-year-old grandson would be crowned George III. The transition did not bode well for the American colonies.<br />This anecdote and its layered consequences launch Akhil Reed Amar’s fascinating book “The Words That Made Us.” A masterly synthesis of history and law, Mr. Amar’s tome delivers, as the author describes it, a wide-angled, multigenerational narrative of “the American constitutional project.”<br />Revolutionary America is remembered for its physical action: “bullets flew, tea chests splashed, cannons roared.” Yet, Mr. Amar argues, that’s only half the story. “A cannon can roar but it cannot speak.” Listening in on the Founding Fathers, Mr. Amar traces “America’s constitutional conversation” from 1760 to 1840. “In each generation,” he writes, “history’s kaleidoscope continued to turn and create new patterns of constitutional discourse.” As some issues “tumbled into view, others fell out of sight, and still others reemerged in vivid new configurations” as Americans of all stripes “participated in a boisterous and sophisticated conversation about legal and political first principles.”<br />One early conversation involved Paxton’s Case (1761), a little-known search-and-seizure lawsuit. The crown’s so-called writs of assistance, the colonists felt, left merchants vulnerable to arbitrary searches. The colonists sued, and the court ruled for the crown—but not before the colonists’ lawyer made a forceful case for protecting essential rights and freedoms. In an otherwise mundane argument about smuggled goods, Mr. Amar tells us, we begin to see “the profound passions, the deep tensions, and the underlying forces that would eventually rip the British Empire apart in 1776.”<br />Pictures spoke too. Mr. Amar studies Benjamin Franklin’s “Join or Die” cartoon—published in the 1750s, early in the French and Indian War, and showing a severed snake symbolizing the still disunited colonies—through “its early appearances, its hibernation, its revivals at key moments, and its evolution.” By 1765, through words and images, Americans spoke “constitutionally to each other and were trying to talk to London.” Some Britons—like Lord Camden and William Pitt—were listening. But not George III. “The king and his inner circle, trapped as they were in an Old World set of institutions and understandings, did not appreciate the democratic revolution exploding in the New World.” America boasted “audacious newspapers, edgy cartoons, essays by anonymous authors, extralegal and self-selected assemblages everywhere, massive civil disobedience, and grand-scale performance art.” Thomas Jefferson didn’t write the Declaration of Independence, Mr. Amar contends. America did.</td>

      <td>The Supreme Court puts significant limits on the government’s claims on the rights of owners.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court’s conservative majority so far this term hasn’t broken new Constitutional ground with its narrow rulings. That changed Wednesday with the Court’s 6-3 Cedar Point Nursery decision, which significantly bolsters protections of private property rights.<br />Two growers in California challenged a 1975 regulation by the state’s Agricultural Labor Relations Board that requires farmers to allow union organizers onto their property three hours a day for 120 days each year. They argued that the regulation was equivalent to a time-limited government easement and thus constituted what’s known as a “per se” physical taking of property.<br />The Constitution’s takings clause provides that private property shall not “be taken for public use, without just compensation.” When the government physically acquires private property for public use via eminent domain—say, to build a pipeline or road—the government is obligated to provide the owner with just compensation.<br />Here, the state argued it wasn’t physically taking the farmers’ property. Instead it was merely regulating its use—no different from requiring businesses to let health and safety inspectors onto property. So long as it isn’t permanently occupying or confiscating property, the state claimed it doesn’t have to compensate the owners.<br />The Court’s Penn Central (1978) precedent allows governments to regulate property use for the “common good” without compensating owners as long as the economic impact isn’t severe. Governments have used Penn Central to justify all sorts of regulations that deprive owners of the beneficial use of their property, and courts have usually given them deference.</td>

      <td>The New Jersey Supreme Court upholds charter expansions.</td>
      <td>Education choice for Newark families has been spared a blow. A 7-0 decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the expansion of seven charter schools to serve thousands more students.<br />The state Education Commissioner approved the Newark charter school expansion requests in 2016. An advocacy group called the Education Law Center sued, claiming the Commissioner had not considered the fiscal harm the expansion would cause for Newark’s traditional public schools. It also said more charter enrollment would worsen segregation by race and disability and among English-language learners in the district.<br />But the school district had not demonstrated any potential fiscal harm before the Commissioner approved the expansions, the Supreme Court ruled. The Court said the Commissioner should have considered the impact on demographic disparities, but that it would be “unfair” to reverse the approval five years later. An appellate court, the ruling noted, “found no evidence of discriminatory practices by the charter schools.”<br />Some 80% of the 20,000 students in Newark’s charter schools are black and 16% are Hispanic; in district schools, roughly 40% of students are black and 50% are Hispanic. Eight thousand students are on charter waiting lists. A Boston Universityworking paper in May found that students with disabilities and English-language learners enrolled in a Newark charter school were less likely to leave within two years than those enrolled in a district school.<br />But progressives would prefer that minority families stay in Newark’s struggling district schools. Fifty-six percent of Newark charter students were proficient in English language arts and 44% in math in 2018-19, compared to some 36% and 26% of district students.</td>

      <td>The SEC Chair won’t enforce a rule to disclose the conflicts of interest of proxy advisory firms.</td>
      <td>While punishing businesses it doesn’t like, the Biden Administration is moving fast to ease regulation on those that advance its climate goals. Witness how Mr. Biden’s new Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler is moving to roll back the regulation of proxy advisory firms.<br />The SEC announced this month that it will suspend enforcement of new rules issued under former Chairman Jay Clayton that subjected proxy advisory firms to the same anti-fraud rules as public companies and required them to disclose their business conflicts. Mr. Gensler has directed SEC staff to consider revising the rules.<br />Large institutional investors rely on recommendations by the two giant proxy advisers, Glass Lewis and  Institutional Shareholder Services  (ISS), since they don’t want to take the time to analyze the tens of thousands of shareholder ballot items. Instead, they pay the advisory firms to research companies, tell them how to vote on issues, and often cast ballots in lock-step with recommendations.<br />Institutional investors are three times more likely to cast votes in proxy elections than are retail investors. A 2018 study by the American Council for Capital Formation found that 175 asset managers, controlling more than $5 trillion in assets, voted with ISS more than 95% of the time. The result is that the proxy advisers play an outsize role in U.S. corporate governance.<br />Proxy advisers “are effectively our largest shareholders, despite having no direct stake in  Exxon Mobil ’s  success,” the oil and gas giant noted in a public comment last year responding to Mr. Clayton’s proposed rule-making. Glass Lewis and ISS along with public pension funds assisted hedge fund Engine No. 1’s boardroom coup at Exxon last month.</td>

      <td>Unlike the levies of the world wars, his would be permanent and without extensive deductions</td>
      <td>‘We have got to confiscate wealth,” Rep. John Nance Garner of Texas said in 1917. Garner, who served as vice president during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first two terms, was talking about how to finance World War I. But some Democrats miss those days, and the Biden crowd is proposing ferocious tax increases that could rival or exceed Roosevelt’s.<br />The top federal income-tax rate rose to 77% in 1918 from 7% in 1913. Following World War I, the top rate came down, reaching just 25% from 1925-31. Rates were raised during the Great Depression to 64% in 1932 and 79% in 1936. In April 1942, Roosevelt proposed a top individual tax rate of 100%, declaring that amid “grave national danger, when all excess income should go to win the war, no American citizen ought to have a net income, after he has paid his taxes, of more than $25,000” (the equivalent of a bit more than $400,000 in 2021 dollars). The Treasury Department said this top rate would only affect 11,000 taxpayers. Democrats in Congress pronounced it dead on arrival. Still, the top World War II rate reached 94%. But generous deductions and easier conversion of ordinary income into capital gains helped high-income taxpayers avoid paying that rate.<br />Top individual tax rates remained at 91% until 1964, when Congress passed John F. Kennedy’s tax reduction proposal and set the top rate at 70%. Richard Nixon carved out a 50% top rate on salary and self-employment (known as “earned income”) in 1969. Then Ronald Reagan pushed the rate on other income down to 50% too, and finally down to 28% in 1988. These reductions were accompanied by removing or altering deductions that had previously helped taxpayers avoid paying the top rate. Today’s Democrats aspire to raise rates to the skies while also limiting such offsetting exclusions.<br />We have come a long way from 1909, when the top corporate income-tax rate was a flat 1%, rising to 53% during World War II, and settling at 34% under Reagan. Thereafter, individual rates rose until Donald Trump brought rates down to 37% (plus the 3.8% Medicare tax) for individuals and 21% for corporations.<br />The Biden administration proposes to raise the top individual rate to 39.6% (plus 3.8%) and to 28% for corporations. From a historical perspective, these rates aren’t unprecedented. But accounting for state and local income taxes and stacking on additional crushing Democratic tax proposals would push the rates far higher.</td>

Its inaugural launch editorial declared: “We are convinced that Hongkongers who are accustomed to freedom will not stay silent in the face of unreasonable restrictions and unfair treatments, for Hongkongers are born with a passion for freedom.” Apple Daily journalists pledged to “stick to our posts and work hard, to be proud Hongkongers through and through.”<br />That was before the Chinese Communist Party last year forced Hong Kong under the boot of its National Security Law, which this week took down Apple Daily. Its crime was being the most popular source of news and opinion focused on Hong Kong values such as the rule of law, free markets and the free flow of information. The newspaper’s demise mirrors the experience of the Hong Kong people as Beijing deploys the National Security Law to exert control over the territory. Hundreds have been arrested under the repressive law, including longtime legislators.<br />As members of the board of  Next Digital Ltd. , the publicly traded company that operates Apple Daily, we voted Wednesday to close down the paper after the Hong Kong authorities used the law to freeze the company’s assets without a trial or even a court order. The freeze makes it impossible for the company to pay its staff, buy ink or keep the electricity on.<br />Hong Kong authorities had already jailed Mr. Lai, who is now serving a 20-month prison term for participating in an assembly that was deemed unlawful. Some 500 armed police raided the Apple Daily offices last week. They arrested Next Digital’s CEO and Apple Daily’s editor in chief and denied bail to both; the chief editorial writer was arrested this week.<br />The way the authorities undermined the functioning of equity markets, property rights and contracts is a warning for other companies that are publicly traded in Hong Kong or simply doing business there.</td>

      <td>Have you ever felt you’re about to witness a gigantic pileup and there’s nothing you can do to stop it? I’d bet some congressional Democrats feel a similar foreboding looking at the enormous price tag of all the legislation that President Biden and their House and Senate leaders are pushing.<br />Some items on the list are wanna-do’s: ideas to expand government, spend money and jack up taxes. Though Mr. Biden didn’t devote much attention to these as a candidate last fall, many congressional Democrats seem eager for the president to deliver on campaign promises he didn’t make.<br />The so-called voting-rights bill that fizzled Tuesday is one example. There’s also Mr. Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill—much of which doesn’t fall under the commonly accepted definition of infrastructure—and his $1.8 trillion American Family Plan, a grab bag of federal intrusions into families, their lives and livelihoods.<br />The Democrats’ list of wanna-do’s is growing rapidly and regularly. Last week, Sen. Bernie Sanders called for a $6 trillion spending package with an even more elastic definition of infrastructure. Meanwhile, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led a cadre of Democrats to demand more climate provisions be included in any infrastructure bill. On June 21 a group organized by members of the “Squad” also called for extending the federal eviction moratorium that began during lockdown.<br />Speaker Nancy Pelosi may (barely) have the votes to pass measures like these through the House, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer doesn’t have all 50 of his Democrats corralled for even the stuff on which he, the speaker and the president all agree.</td>

The American left’s utopia is on hold in Congress.<br />The second front is as far from utopia as one can imagine—the U.S.’s troubled urban centers of violence, homelessness and homicide.<br />On Tuesday, New York City’s voters went to the polls in the Democratic mayoral primary. In post-pandemic Gotham this vote was about just one thing: crime.<br />Before the Covid-19 pandemic closed down the world, New York’s annual tourist traffic numbered about 60 million, an incomprehensible crush of eager humanity.
