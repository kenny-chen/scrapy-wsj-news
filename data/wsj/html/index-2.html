      <td>Authorities are seeking to keep Jacob Chansley detained until he faces a trial on charges connected to the siege by Trump supporters</td>
      <td>The Arizona man who stormed the Capitol last week in a coyote tail headdress, armed with a six-foot spear and a bullhorn, left a menacing note for Vice President Mike Pence on the Senate dais, federal prosecutors said in a court filing arguing for his detention.<br />Prosecutors said Jacob Chansley, who calls himself the QAnon Shaman, incited fellow Trump supporters rioting inside the Capitol building and disobeyed police orders. Shortly after Mr. Pence was hustled out of the Senate Chambers, Mr. Chansley entered the room, climbed to Mr. Pence’s dais, and posed for photographs, prosecutors said.<br />According to prosecutors, Mr. Chansley, 33 years old, also left a note for Mr. Pence: “it’s only a matter of time, justice is coming.”<br />Prosecutors had initially said in court filings that Mr. Chansley and other rioters intended to capture and assassinate lawmakers at the Capitol. On Friday, Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which is leading the sprawling investigation, said there was no direct evidence of capture and kill teams.<br />The new information about the role of Mr. Chansley—whose painted face and colorful attire made him the most recognizable participant in the riot—came in a detention brief filed by prosecutors on Thursday.</td>

      <td>WILMINGTON, Del.—President-elect Joe Biden outlined his proposal to give the federal government a bigger role in getting Americans vaccinated against Covid-19, including setting up federally supported community centers and mobile clinics for delivering shots.<br />The plan, which Mr. Biden described in a speech Friday, marks a shift in the coronavirus response that has so far involved the federal government purchasing and distributing vaccines, while relying heavily on states to administer the shots.<br />“This will be one of the most challenging operational efforts ever undertaken by the country. But you have my word. We will manage the hell out of this operation,” Mr. Biden said, before adding that he needed funding from Congress to make it happen.<br />“I’m optimistic, I’m convinced the American people are ready to spare no effort and no expense to get this done,” he said.<br />Mr. Biden said he would expand the use of a Korean War-era national security mobilization law, known as the Defense Production Act, in an effort to increase manufacturing of vaccines and vaccination supplies. He also called for a “federally led, locally focused public education campaign” to encourage Americans to get the vaccine.</td>

Democrats are still figuring out how to proceed without derailing the start of President-elect Joe Biden’s term, with cabinet nominees and a Covid-19 aid package also requiring the Senate’s attention.<br />“You’ll be the first to know when we announce we’re going over there,” Mrs. Pelosi told reporters.<br />A guilty verdict in the eventual trial wouldn’t remove Mr. Trump from office, as he would already be gone. But Democrats want to send a message, and senators angered by his actions could also vote to bar him from holding office in the future.<br />“Donald Trump remains a threat to our democracy and will be held accountable for what he’s done—whether or not he’s president during trial,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).</td>

      <td>MEXICO CITY—Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Friday accused the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration of fabricating drug charges against Mexico’s former defense minister, an allegation analysts said would further strain bilateral relations and security cooperation between both nations.<br />The Mexican leader defended the decision by his attorney general not to prosecute Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, who had been arrested by the U.S. in October and then sent back to Mexico a month later following a diplomatic uproar from Mexico, which complained it hadn’t been informed of the probe and threatened to curb security cooperation with Washington.<br />Mexico had vowed to investigate the powerful former general upon his return, using evidence that U.S. officials handed over. The Mexican Attorney General’s Office said Thursday it had investigated the general and found no connection to organized crime or any suspicious increase in his net worth.<br />Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Friday the evidence wasn’t solid enough to arrest the general much less convict him in a Mexican court.<br />Mr. López Obrador went further, saying the DEA concocted the case. He accused the agency of either “consciously or unconsciously” sabotaging the relationship with Mexico when it didn’t inform the Mexican government of its investigation.</td>

Media fact checkers determined that 97% of last year’s protests involved no injuries and no property damage. However, by the middle of 2020, it was estimated that “mostly peaceful” protests resulted in at least a couple of billion dollars in damages in places like Kenosha, Minneapolis, New York City and Chicago, to name a few. Also, even 3% of, say, 2,000 “mostly peaceful” protesters amounts to five dozen mostly not peaceful people.<br />The Capitol building is a more important symbol of America than is the federal courthouse in Portland, Ore., that was a nightly target of vandals, arsonists and looters for weeks last summer.

      <td>Leon Kass’s assertion that “For most of its history, America was a nation characterized by reverence as much as by liberty” belies history.</td>
      <td>I respectfully disagree with Leon Kass’s argument in “Exodus and American Nationhood” (Review, Jan. 9). The religious argument he puts forward is profoundly misplaced. The American tradition of civic republicanism isn’t rooted in Judeo-Christian values or the Puritans’ devotion to the Hebrew Bible, but in the Lockean tradition of individual rights. Our Founding Fathers were mostly influenced by deism. One need only to read the U.S. Constitution, Amendment I, to see how wrong Mr. Kass’s views are, and how determined our founders were to guarantee our individual rights from governmental or religious tyranny.<br />Mr. Kass’s equating atheism and political fanaticism is disgraceful. Mr. Kass claims that “with both atheism and political fanaticism on the rise in Western societies, we may soon discover what happens should humanity return to the dehumanizing pre-Biblical alternatives whose modern equivalents lurk offstage.” President Trump’s dangerous photo op on June 1, 2020, in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, Bible in hand, as well as his widespread support among Christian Evangelicals, Christian Zionists and the Israeli government all serve as stark reminders of the dangerous nature of religion. I doubt that all the terrorists who violently stormed the U.S. Capitol last week were atheists.<br />Finally, Mr. Kass’s assertion that “for most of its history, America was a nation characterized by reverence as much as by liberty” belies history. I am particularly disappointed to read a University of Chicago professor emeritus so willfully disregard our history of the genocide of Native Americans, 250 years of slavery and a century of Jim Crow laws that terrorized African-Americans. In today’s current reckoning with structural racism, Mr. Kass’s argument is off base.<br />Jennifer A. Lind<br />Wilmette, Ill.</td>

      <td>Medieval language was rich with allegory and metaphor, and those of the time often drew such types of connections to natural phenomena.</td>
      <td>I am disappointed by Amanda Foreman’s uncritical reporting of a supposed medieval superstition that the Perseid meteor shower was caused by St. Lawrence’s burning tears (“Awed by the Meteors of the New Year’s Sky,” Review, Jan. 2).<br />That people in the Middle Ages seriously believed the Perseids to be St. Lawrence’s tears is simply not true. Aristotle’s Meteorologica was well known in Latin translation in the Middle Ages, so his theory of exhalations would have been current.<br />Medieval language was rich with allegory and metaphor, and those of the time often drew such types of connections to natural phenomena (a similar concept: we moderns refer to the heart as the seat of feelings, despite our biological knowledge to the contrary).<br />The first source for this tradition, Edward Herrick, wrote in 1839 when the Scientific Revolution was well under way. As was often the case in the 19th century, he misinterpreted the allegory of ages past for superstitious beliefs about the nature of the universe. Discussions of history should reflect the better understanding we now have of medieval idiom and style.<br />Timothy Lesinski</td>

      <td>Investors are ramping up wagers that the Biden administration’s focus on economic stimulus and electric vehicles will turbocharge a monthslong climb in copper and other industrial metals.<br />Even though they slid alongside other commodities Friday, most actively traded copper futures are still up more than 2% so far in 2021 and near their highest level since early in 2013. They have been lifted by buoyant demand from China and wagers that an improving global economy will further increase consumption later this year.<br />Copper and other raw materials such as zinc and aluminum are the building blocks of construction, used to manufacture everything from computers to houses. That makes their prices extremely sensitive to momentum in the global economy and Chinese growth. China is the world’s largest commodity consumer by far and is responsible for about half of global demand for copper and other metals.<br />After China largely contained the coronavirus, its economy has motored ahead of the rest of the world recently, making it a rare bright spot. That has sparked the rally in metals, pushing up copper 25% in the last six months as part of a vast rise in riskier markets.<br />In another sign of sentiment in metals markets, shares of copper miner  Freeport-McMoRan Inc.  have more than doubled in the last six months and are already up 17% so far this year. Many analysts look at the performance of mining stocks to gauge sentiment because they are more accessible to many investors than futures contracts, which expire every month and are more complex.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Shortly after becoming the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice, President Trump summoned political advisers and demanded to know more about the 10 Republicans who had voted against him.<br />Mr. Trump, who had feared an even larger number of defections, wanted to know who the lawmakers were and whether he had ever done anything for them, according to people familiar with the meeting. He also inquired who might run against them when they face re-election in two years, the people said.<br />The president has grown increasingly concerned with defections against him within his own party, aides say. Now, he must plot his defense in a second Senate trial that will hinge on his level of GOP support, with far fewer legal and political allies than the last time he was impeached. Mr. Trump has called several Republicans on Capitol Hill in recent days to seek their advice on who he should recruit, as the personal attorneys who defended him last time and White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, have made clear to associates they don’t intend to serve on his team, according to people familiar with the discussions.<br />Advisers have urged the president not to tap Rudy Giuliani, his personal attorney who—to the chagrin of several Trump advisers—led the campaign to overturn the results of the election, telling Mr. Trump that he needs a sophisticated attorney who can stick to the facts.<br />Some advisers have discussed John Eastman, a conservative constitutional law professor who was one of the few legal experts who told Mr. Trump that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to block certain electors from being counted on Jan. 6, as a possible defense attorney, according to a person familiar with the conversations.</td>

      <td>President-elect Joe Biden’s economic-relief plan places low-income families at its center, delivering cash, housing assistance, food and child-care support to the most vulnerable Americans. It is also a way for Democrats to get some long-sought priorities into law.<br />Mr. Biden released his $1.9 trillion plan on Thursday, urging Congress to help states, provide money to households and accelerate vaccinations in the early days of his administration. Democrats applauded the package, but its legislative path is uncertain as Mr. Biden tries to find enough Republican support in the Senate to overcome procedural hurdles.<br />Democrats, who will have slim House and Senate majorities, can muscle much of the plan through Congress if bipartisan talks stall or collapse. They gained that power by winning control of the Senate, giving them the opportunity to merge their response to the pandemic with longstanding policies on redistribution and inequality. The ideas they are advancing include an increase in the child tax credit for low-income households and expanded paid leave for workers.<br />The Biden proposal and its money for vaccinations and households would address rising risks to the U.S. economic recovery, even if the final version is smaller than the $1.9 trillion plan, said Robard Williams, senior vice president of Moody’s Investors Service.<br />Recent economic data underscore the halting nature of the recovery. Retail sales fell for a third straight month in December, a report on Friday showed. The economy lost jobs in December, the Labor Department said last week, ending seven months of employment gains.</td>

Shares had opened Friday at $33.40, placing the company’s market value at $13.7 billion.<br />Playtika’s suite of smartphone games includes casino-style options such as “Caesars Slots,” “House of Fun” and “Poker Heat.” The company, founded a decade ago, saw its revenue rise 28% to $1.8 billion for the first nine months of 2020 compared with a year earlier. Profit fell 94%, hurt by higher costs and expenses, though it has been profitable for years, unlike most of its tech peers that have recently gone public.<br />“Probably one difference from most companies going public is that we have real cash flow,” said Craig Abrahams, Playtika’s president and finance chief, in an interview, adding that now Playtika will gain a larger balance sheet, enabling it to do more deals and reward its employees with equity. “It gives us a lot of flexibility.”<br />In 2016, Playtika was acquired for $4.4 billion in cash by a Chinese consortium including an affiliate of videogame developer Giant Interactive Group and a private-equity firm set up by  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  founder Jack Ma.</td>

In an open letter to the companies, the health ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia said the incident was unacceptable and risked undermining the credibility of the vaccine rollout, which is already facing public distrust.<br />The German government said in a statement that it deplored what it called the short notice and unexpected news, noting that Pfizer was failing to meet a contractual obligation.<br />“The company has made a binding commitment to a delivery schedule until mid-February,” the statement said.</td>

      <td>WhatsApp is delaying a controversial update to its privacy policy following backlash from some users over how it would share data with  Facebook Inc.,  which owns the popular messaging service.<br />The company said its roughly two billion users would have until May 15 to review and accept the new policy, which is when the data changes are set to go into effect. If users don’t consent by then, the app will eventually stop working for them, a spokesman said. The previous deadline for accepting the changes was Feb. 8.<br />“We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update,” a WhatsApp spokesman said. “There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts.”<br />WhatsApp said the new policy isn’t geared to expanding its ability to share data with Facebook but rather to allowing businesses that interact with customers on WhatsApp to store those conversations on Facebook servers. The move was a key step in Facebook’s plan to generate revenue with the app after many years of struggling to do so. Businesses will also be able to store user shopping activity on the servers.<br />The apparent user resistance and confusion about the new policy point to the difficulty the service faces in advancing on a profit-generating path. Even as WhatsApp remains a market leader in messaging, competition among encrypted messaging platforms is intensifying with privacy concerns growing as a key consideration for users.</td>

      <td>Holdup left states with little time to develop mass-vaccination plan; U.S. says it needed time for interagency clearance</td>
      <td>Operation Warp Speed leaders waited more than two months to approve a plan to distribute and administer Covid-19 vaccines proposed by U.S. health officials, administration officials said, leaving states with little time to implement a mass-vaccination campaign amid a coronavirus surge.<br />State and local officials had been clamoring for months for help preparing for the largest vaccination program in U.S. history when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a playbook in September to guide them.<br />The CDC had wanted to start helping states plan in June how to get people vaccinated. But officials at Operation Warp Speed rebuffed the agency’s plan for distributing vaccines. They adopted a similar plan in August only after exploring other options—and then held the release of the CDC’s playbook for states for two weeks for additional clearance and to put it out with another document, the officials said.<br />Operation Warp Speed was supposed to be a high-water mark of the Trump administration’s coronavirus response, but it stumbled at the finish line because of problems in federal planning and foresight. Now, the public-private partnership is scrambling to speed up vaccinations, adjusting eligibility guidelines while states race to increase their abilities to administer doses on a large scale.<br />“They didn’t plan for the last inch of the last mile, the part that matters most—how you’re going to actually vaccinate that many people quickly,” said Dr. Bruce Gellin, a former Health and Human Services vaccine official and president of global immunization at the Sabin Vaccine Institute.</td>

Carrefour is one of the country’s largest employers with 105,000 staff.<br />Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters he was aware of discussions between Couche-Tard and the French government but declined to comment further.<br />Mr. Le Maire later spoke on the phone with Quebec’s economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, about the offer.

      <td>Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré enlisted to lead congressional probe; inspectors general at Justice, Homeland Security, Defense and Interior departments to probe possible weaknesses</td>
      <td>Four government watchdogs and Congress said Friday they are launching sweeping reviews of how law-enforcement and security officials responded to the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol, including what intelligence they had ahead of the attack and whether they shared it with other agencies.<br />Inspectors general for the departments of Justice, Homeland Security, Defense and the Interior will focus on what federal agencies knew before the Jan. 6 rampage as well as their actions that day. Thousands of pro-Trump rioters stormed the halls of Congress as lawmakers were ratifying Joe Biden’s election victory. A woman and a Capitol Police officer were killed and three others died of medical emergencies during the melee.<br />On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said she has enlisted retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré to lead a review of the security infrastructure, interagency processes, and command and control. In the wake of the attack, the sergeants-at-arms of the House and Senate both resigned, and the head of the Capitol Police also quit. Gen. Honoré came to prominence as the commander of Joint Task Force Katrina, which was responsible for coordinating military relief efforts along the Gulf Coast after the 2005 hurricane.<br />U.S. law-enforcement officials have acknowledged that they underestimated the potential for violence during what they assumed would be a largely peaceful political rally with some violent agitators, as had been the case during other recent demonstrations. Federal agencies have also been criticized for being slow to provide backup for Capitol Police officers once it was clear the mob had breached the building.<br />The riot through the Capitol building laid bare the disjointed and overlapping nature of law-enforcement authorities tasked with policing protests in the nation’s capital. Local police often handle crowd-control issues in the city but cede jurisdiction to Capitol Police—the primary agency responsible for security on the complex—once on the grounds of congressional buildings. An array of federal agencies based in the city also have agents they can deploy, but quashing riots isn’t their primary mission.</td>

      <td><br />Like a silent sentinel, the statue of Abraham Lincoln has long loomed over dignitaries who have lain in state in the Capitol Rotunda, among them presidents, members of Congress and even the Capitol Police officers shot to death defending the building in 1998. Then, on Jan. 6, young artist Vinnie Ream’s 7-foot-tall marble sculpture appeared in the background as a mob swarmed the Rotunda. It was not difficult to imagine the gracefully extended arm that once seemed to beckon onlookers now gesturing, at least in the selfies taken by rioters, for a halt to the madness.<br />Painful as it was to see an icon endangered by a crush of unrestrained insurrectionists, this particular one is no stranger to disrespect. Since its unveiling, it has been ridiculed, moved and damaged. Whether it is a treasure or a novelty has long remained unsettled. Its recent close call suggests the time is ripe for a positive reassessment.<br />Controversial it has always been. The very idea of awarding the prestigious commission to an 18-year-old novice triggered furious debate before Ream emerged the youngest artist and first female authorized by Congress to produce a sculpture for the Capitol. What she lacked in experience, Vinnie Ream (1847-1914) made up for in confidence, charm, connections and enterprise.<br />Ream and her parents moved to wartime Washington in 1861. There, two years later, a family friend, Rep. James Rollins, introduced her to sculptor Clark Mills, whose equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson already graced Lafayette Square. Dabbling with clay at Mills’s studio, Ream produced a likeness of an Indian chief that so beguiled the veteran artist he invited her to study with him.</td>

      <td>In 1985, Myra Mimlitsch-Gray took a class from master metalsmith John Prip, known for his handsome silver coffeepots with a spare, Danish functionalist edge. But the “Melting Teapot” Ms. Mimlitsch-Gray went on to create 20 years later would be a nightmare at any dinner party—half-melted and half about to take flight, its spout defiantly twisted.<br />With its mix of traditional production skills and maverick intentions, “Melting Teapot” fits perfectly in “Crafting America,” a new exhibition opening Feb. 6 at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark. The show includes 120 works in a variety of media, including ceramics, fiber, wood, metal and glass, by a diverse group of American artists, including Ruth Asawa, Jeffrey Gibson and Peter Voulkos.<br />”Crafting America” explores the difference between a craft artwork and a skillfully constructed piece meant for ordinary use. Exhibition co-curator Glenn Adamson defines craft artwork as “skilled making on a human scale,” and co-curator Jen Padgett says that such artworks have a broad appeal for museumgoers. Only a narrow slice of the American public has studied painting, she points out, but “everyone has a connection to craft.”<br />Some of the artists draw on craft traditions, like Steven Young Lee, whose works evoke venerable Chinese vases. His “Vase With Dragon” (2020), made of porcelain, cobalt inlay and glaze, has a gaping crack in it, as if the vase had been incubating a creature that just emerged. Wendell Castle, who died in 2018, often evoked living things in his furniture, as in a 1962 wooden chest of drawers that seems to be under attack by the tendrils that serve as its legs and penetrate its frame. Other artists reach deep into their inner worlds. Linda Lopez, who works near Crystal Bridges, creates “furry” ceramic sculptures formed from multitudes of clay droplets; they look like friendly, obscure sea creatures.<br />Many craft artists use familiar materials to make sharp points about society or history. Katherine Vetne was inspired by scrolling through online wedding registries to create warped versions of upscale household items—satires of materialism that evoke gracious living after the apocalypse. For “All This Could Be Yours” (2021), the artist melted lead crystal ware, then used silver nitrate to transform the distorted items into a mirrored surface. The process heightens the objects’ “perceived value as well as creating reflective surfaces that create warped images of the world around them,” as she has written on her website.</td>

      <td>The executive director of Innovations for Poverty Action argues that rigorous experiments can produce better policies to help solve seemingly intractable development problems</td>
      <td>Every year, nearly a half million children under the age of 5 die from diseases related to diarrhea around the world, mostly from drinking unsafe water, according to the World Health Organization. Even when governments and nonprofit groups invest in cleaner water sources, the water is often recontaminated in people’s homes. A small amount of chlorine will keep water clean for 24 hours. But marketing campaigns to promote this cheap extra step rarely have a lasting effect, despite the enormous health benefits.<br />“A common misconception about poverty is that people simply need to be trained to make better decisions,” says Annie Duflo, 42, the executive director of Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), a Washington-based nonprofit group that evaluates programs serving the poor. When every day is a struggle, she argues, the best choice must be an easy one.<br />With that mind-set, researchers from IPA found a far more effective strategy for reducing diarrhea-related deaths: simply placing free chlorine dispensers near water sources. Not only does this offer a well-timed reminder to chlorinate, but it also allows users to publicly model wise behavior to others. Thanks to IPA’s findings, chlorine dispensers now help to make the water safe for more than four million people in Kenya, Malawi and Uganda.<br />“Oftentimes people need a short nudge rather than a long lecture,” Ms. Duflo says over the phone from her home in Belleville, N.Y., where she lives with her husband and their 18-month-old daughter.<br />Anecdotes and intuition aren’t enough to fight poverty, she explains. But nonprofits often don’t have the funds or capacity to study what works and what doesn’t. As a result, many governments and donors throw money at ineffective solutions. IPA works to prevent such waste by rigorously measuring programs, often using randomized control trials.</td>

      <td>While you’re waiting for the borders to reopen, why not take a culinary trip by way of French fromages? Here, five tantalizing, regional tastes handpicked by one of France’s top cheesemongers.</td>
      <td>VINCENT VERGNE, my local cheesemonger in the southern French city of Nîmes, offers a solution for anyone pining for France: a cheese board. “French cheeses are not only a major part of the country’s gastronomic glory,” said Mr. Vergne, “but a well-composed selection can tell France’s history [with] edible monuments to Gallic ingenuity.”<br />It’s little surprise that Mr. Vergne—awarded the coveted title of Meilleur Ouvrier de France (Best Craftsman of France) in the fromage category in 2019—is a big booster of curds and whey. “It’s like winning the Olympics,” said Mr. Vergne, referring to the title, as he arranged his wares in the shop’s glass-fronted cases before opening early on a recent winter morning. Those awarded the MOF title wear instantly recognizable white jackets with stand-up red-white-and-blue collars. In the jacket pocket, Mr. Vergne keeps the handsome golden medal he received in a ceremony at Paris’s La Sorbonne in May 2019, the last time the competition was held.<br />Mr. Vergne is a second-generation fromager. In 1977, his parents opened their first cheese stand in Les Halles de Nîmes, his city’s covered market. At 14, he said, he found his calling for the trade when he accompanied his father on a visit to a producer of Reblochon cheese in the Savoie region. “The farmer showed me how milk was transformed into the curds from which cheese is made, and it struck me as a kind of magic.”<br />I’ve been an enthusiastic patron of Fromagerie Vergne—he has two shops now, including the one on Avenue Georges Pompidou in Central Nîmes and the larger one in Les Halles de Nîmes—since I ditched my Paris apartment after the 10-week Covid lockdown last spring to ride out the rest of the pandemic in my stone house in a small village just outside Nîmes. Like many people in this strange, stressful time, I’ve found sustaining solace in delicious food. But the cheeses I buy from Fromagerie Vergne serve another purpose too: They’re delectable reminders of the country’s other regions, a way to travel around France without traveling.<br />At my request Mr. Vergne created a miniature Tour de France, a selection of five of his favorite cheeses, each from a distinct region but all available in the U.S. Nibble on them now with the hope that someday soon, you can travel back to France and head straight to the source.</td>

Walmart shut down Jet.com to focus on Walmart.com, and its e-commerce executives and teams reported to the head of Walmart’s U.S. stores.<br />Walmart said Mr. Lore, its U.S. e-commerce chief, will retire on Jan. 31 and stay as a consultant through September. The company said it unified its U.S. store and e-commerce operations in 2020. Following Mr. Lore’s exit, the business will continue to report to John Furner, the company’s U.S. chief executive.<br />“I think we had a five-year plan on what we wanted to accomplish and I think we largely did exactly what we set out to do,” said Mr. Lore in an interview. “The hope was that by that time we would converge the e-commerce and stores into one omni-organization and we would have one leader.”</td>

      <td>A painter’s journey from enfant terrible to the great portraitist of his age.</td>
      <td>Looking back on the “odd and unfamiliar” life of Scofield Thayer, the reclusive avant-garde patron, publisher and poet, John Richardson offered what I am tempted to call Richardson’s Law: “Pampered lunatics often reach a great age.” Though Lucian Freud was the day to Thayer’s night, I was at times reminded of this maxim while reading the second volume of William Feaver’s exemplary biography of the painter, “Fame, 1968-2011.” Along with the previous installment (“The Restless Years, 1922-1968,” from 2019), “Fame” is everything an artist’s biography ought to be—illuminating, allergic to cant, personal, enormously picaresque—but so seldom is. Mr. Feaver’s “Lives” of Freud cannot be praised too highly.<br />“The Restless Years” was the story of Freud’s Berlin childhood, his emigration to England in 1933, and his misadventures at school and, when the war came, in the merchant navy. He married twice, sired at least 14 children—Freud rated himself “one of the great absentee fathers of the age”—and, in between glamorous parties and underworld scrapes, matured into one of the 20th century’s essential portraitists.<br />Mr. Feaver, the former art critic of the Observer who interviewed Freud over the course of nearly 40 years, did well not to belabor his subject’s family tree, engaging the reader instead with improbable, mostly unsavory, often hilarious doings. From his earliest age, Freud stood apart. Chaperoned by his grandmother to the Neues Museum in Berlin, he vastly preferred the recently unveiled painted bust of Nefertiti to the “brown and disgusting” Rembrandts. A German-born Jew, he professed little interest in religion and taunted his brother, Clement—erroneously—for sharing Hitler’s birthday. (Clement, in turn, questioned Lucian’s paternity.)<br />Once in England, he was enrolled at Devon’s wildly permissive Dartington Hall, which did without marks, prizes, penalties, competitions or compulsory classes. As Freud recalled, “Dartington had only one rule: no pushing people into the swimming pool.” Mr. Feaver does not record whether he observed this particular statute. Freud was, in any event, not the rule-abiding sort and managed to get expelled. (He didn’t even take to the art instruction: “The art master was too arty.”)<br />A stint at—and expulsion from—another public school followed. In parting, the Bryanston headmaster suggested that “if you change your house, your clothes, your behaviour, your friends, your subjects, everything, you can come back next term.” Freud started at the Central School of Art in 1939, his drawings having been presented with other “children’s art” at Peggy Guggenheim’s Cork Street gallery the year before. (They went unsold.) His famous surname—grandfather Sigmund would die that September—his striking looks, and his precocious talents for mischief and draftsmanship produced the impression, marveled the future art historian Lawrence Gowing, of “a boy-wonder.”</td>

      <td>The Baby Boom cohort inherited postwar American prosperity. What have they done with it?</td>
      <td>It is the commonest pattern in politics and society: Peace and prosperity, though good in themselves and furthering of human flourishing, eventually give place to arrogance, decadence and nihilism. “Beware,” God says to the children of Israel in the book of Deuteronomy, “that thou forget not the Lord thy God . . . Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.”<br />That, in a broad and secular sense, is the story of the baby boom generation. Americans born in the 20 years or so after the end of World War II were given quite a country. The destruction of Europe and Japan assured exceptional economic growth, social cohesion had been growing for decades, patriotism pervaded mass culture, and flush economies allowed white Americans to turn their attentions to the injustice of segregation. Yet by the end of the 20th century—the height of the boomers’ influence—the parties were at each other’s throat, popular culture had coarsened beyond recognition, racial tensions seemed to have worsened, and anti-Americanism had become the orthodox stance of the country’s educated elite.<br />It’s not fair to blame a generation for its own failures. The boomers worked with the material they were given, and part of what they were given was a lifeless religious establishmentarianism and an unthinking faith in the power of government. They rightly reacted against the first and embraced the second, but the point is: The baby boom generation didn’t invent themselves and can’t be blamed exclusively for their idiocies.<br />Still, it is a useful exercise to consider the attitudes and presuppositions that impelled members of a generational cohort to act as they did. That is more or less what Helen Andrews does in “Boomers: The Men and Women Who Promised Freedom and Delivered Disaster.” Ms. Andrews, an editor at the American Conservative magazine, is a gifted essayist with a delightful penchant for subversive and tersely worded insights. She has modeled her book on “Eminent Victorians,” Lytton Strachey’s series of mostly disparaging portraits of 19th-century luminaries. “Boomers” appraises six notables: Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, TV and film producer Aaron Sorkin, economist Jeffrey Sachs, feminist academic theorist Camille Paglia, racial rabble-rouser Al Sharpton, and Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor.<br />The chapters in “Boomers” aren’t portraits in the way Strachey’s were. They are essays, and often they stray pretty far from the subject. “The theme that connects all these seeming digressions,” Ms. Andrews writes, “is . . . the essence of boomerness, which sometimes manifests itself as hypocrisy and other times just as irony: they tried to liberate us, and instead of freedom they left behind chaos.” I’m not convinced that this theme, if that’s what it is, sufficiently connects all the discursive wanderings in these essays; you sometimes get the sense that Ms. Andrews wants to bring up a few points of irritation before she takes leave of the subject. But I don’t complain—she’s worth following. In a paragraph about the inflated importance of college degrees, she writes, apropos of not all that much: “In the first hundred days of his presidency Barack Obama proposed spending $12 billion on community colleges, which, if it had passed Congress, would only have resulted in more states deciding that firemen and state troopers must learn how to put their footnotes in MLA format before we give them permission to save our lives.”</td>

      <td>Delayed start to tax season due to Covid-relief legislation means refunds will be delayed</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Internal Revenue Service won’t start accepting 2020 individual income tax returns until Feb. 12, several weeks later than usual, as the agency implements late tax legislation.<br />This tax season could be unusually challenging for the IRS and for taxpayers. The IRS said Friday that it needed time to program and test its computer systems after Congress passed a relief law in late December.<br />“Planning for the nation’s filing season process is a massive undertaking, and IRS teams have been working nonstop,” said IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig.<br />Millions of people who didn’t get the full stimulus payments from laws passed in March and December will be able to claim the money through their 2020 tax returns. That group includes people who had children during 2020 and those who didn’t qualify for the full payments based on 2019 income but saw income drop in 2020. Others will be surprised to learn that unemployment insurance benefits are taxable.<br />The Feb. 12 start date means that some tax refunds will hit bank accounts later than usual. That could slow consumer spending in February, though the $600 per-person stimulus payments that households have been receiving this month could offset that effect.</td>

      <td>Railroads can’t refuse to carry passengers for their political views. The same rule should apply to online monopolies, legal scholar Richard Epstein argues.</td>
      <td>The punitive banishment of Donald Trump from Facebook and Twitter has met with almost uniform approval from the president’s critics. So has the decision by  Apple  and Google to remove Parler, a Twitter alternative favored by Mr. Trump’s supporters, from their app stores. Many Democrats see these actions as a righteous and justified silencing, especially in light of Mr. Trump’s encouraging words for the mob that violently invaded the Capitol on Jan. 6. Even many of Mr. Trump’s supporters concede that  Twitter  and  Facebook  owe him no platform—that only the government has a legal obligation to respect the First Amendment.<br />Richard Epstein takes a different view. The gagging of the president by America’s digital behemoths provokes in him a mix of indignation and distress. A professor at the New York University Law School, he is the foremost libertarian legal scholar in the common-law world. (Mr. Epstein, 77, directs NYU’s Classical Liberal Institute, where I am a fellow.) We converse by Zoom, and he says that he’d tell Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg of Twitter and Facebook, respectively, to “give Trump his account back.”<br />Mr. Epstein envisions the two CEOs as a captive audience: “I’d say to them, ‘Boys, you’ve got to lighten up. You have to be less confident that you know the truth about everything. You know you’re doing your job when you publish stuff on your site that you strongly disagree with, and not in winning the short-term battle of keeping this, that, or the other guy out.”<br />Mr. Epstein describes Mr. Dorsey’s Jan. 13 Twitter thread, in which the CEO purports to explain the ban on Mr. Trump, as displaying “a rare combination of hubris and ignorance, proof of how dangerous it is to have a committed partisan as an ostensible umpire.” Among many assertions that Mr. Epstein finds “questionable” in the thread is Mr. Dorsey’s argument that “if folks do not agree with our rules and enforcement, they can simply go to another Internet service.”<br />Mr. Epstein emphasizes that he’s been frequently critical of Mr. Trump and called on the president to resign as early as February 2017: “I thought his style was so confrontational that you couldn’t keep peace in the land.” Yet he’s been struck by the “one-sided” nature of the debate over Mr. Trump’s ban from social media, focusing almost solely on the First Amendment and how it “applies only to Congress and to the states and doesn’t apply to private parties.” Largely absent from the debate, he says, has been the word “monopoly.”</td>

      <td>America led the world decades ago by sticking warning labels on cigarettes, but not without a fight from an influential industry.<br />In the latest scrap over a label, this one for ethanol, things might be going the other way. While corn-based fuel blended into almost all gasoline is mostly a wasteful boondoggle, using too much of it merely endangers the health of your boat, lawn mower or older car, not that of a human being.<br />But advocates for the higher blend called E15, denoting 15% ethanol content, as opposed to the more common E10, are pushing to change or get rid of the labels that appear at the pump altogether. Sen. Joni Ernst from corn-growing Iowa asked the Environmental Protection Agency “to remove the unnecessary labeling.”<br />Groups representing small engine makers and boaters are urging the opposite: An advocate introduced a bill last year to make the labels larger, contain the word “warning” and use a bolder red rather than orange.<br />The issue became more urgent after President Donald Trump tweeted in September that the EPA would allow existing pumps to also distribute E15, tagging corn belt Republican politicians. The EPA didn’t return a request for comment, but recent media reports say the agency is considering making unspecified changes to the labels.</td>

      <td>Large lenders like JPMorgan Chase are sitting on much more cash than they need</td>
      <td>Big banks have a tantalizing amount of cash on their books, but there is still a ways to go before it can make its way into shareholders’ pockets.<br />JPMorgan Chase  said Friday that it ended 2020 with $1.4 trillion in cash and marketable securities, which it said is some $450 billion in excess of what regulators require. Across  Citigroup ,   PNC Financial Services ,  JPMorgan and  Wells Fargo ,  which all reported earnings Friday, cash assets at year-end represented about 15% of their total assets, well up from less than 10% a year before.<br />Behind this is a wave of deposits driven by the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expansion as well as fiscal stimulus. Large U.S. banks’ loans are now only about 56% of their deposits, down from around 70% before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Fed data.<br />Meanwhile, these banks’ profits were boosted in the fourth quarter by a reversal of credit costs via reserve releases, which investors will want to see a lot more of in 2021. JPMorgan cited the macroeconomy and corporate borrowers having lots of liquidity as major drivers of its release in wholesale lending; it held reserves flat for credit cards.<br />Higher earnings in the fourth quarter could help allow banks to increase buybacks in accordance with the Federal Reserve payout formula, which ties them to average quarterly earnings. JPMorgan said it now has net capacity for $4.5 billion buybacks in the first quarter, part of the $30 billion the bank’s board authorized following the Fed’s December stress test results.</td>

Luxury fitness retailer Peloton reported that membership rose from about 1.6 million to 3.6 million between September 2019 and September 2020. But when a sizable piece of workout gear rolls into modest living quarters, what’s a design-conscious occupant to do?<br />There’s always the classic room divider, said Irvington, N.J., designer Beth Diana Smith. She recommended an upholstered barrier, to completely hide the bike. If equipment will be on display, design above it, she advised. “Use a few large art pieces or a full gallery wall to distract the eye to look behind the bike instead of directly at it.”<br />After ordering a Peloton last August, Washington, D.C., resident Liz Malm was eager to camouflage the bike within her 730-square-foot rental. “I didn’t love laying in bed and staring at it,” said Ms. Malm, who works in government relations and frequently shares DIY content on Instagram.<br />While scrolling the app, Ms. Malm was inspired by a home gym featuring graphic wallpaper on the upper half of the wall and black paint on the lower. Ms. Malm similarly applied matte black pigment on the area surrounding her own bike, stopping at handlebar height. Nearby, shoes and other accessories are corralled in a woven West Elm basket, while plants and hanging artwork further distract the eye.<br />Not ready to enter the dark side? A deep green will work, too, said Washington, D.C., designer Shannon Claire Smith, who painted her walls a moody olive. She advised juxtaposing the sleek bike with traditional elements, a tactic that Michelle Gage, a designer in Bryn Mawr, Pa., has implemented while working with a Peloton-owning client. “We’re including a large ornate mirror; think grand and vintage,” she said.</td>

Salvador Cienfuegos had not had any communication or meeting with any criminal group and therefore wouldn’t face prosecution.<br />The attorney general’s office said it also examined the general’s assets and found the general’s net worth had not grown in any way as to suggest illegal enrichment.<br />U.S. agents arrested Gen. Cienfuegos in October as he arrived in Los Angeles for a family vacation, accusing him of taking bribes in exchange for protecting cartel leaders when he was defense minister between 2012 to 2018. When he was returned in November, Mexico promised to carry out its own investigation.<br />Analysts said that the government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador may have had political motives for not going after the former general, whose arrest angered senior military officers in Mexico. Many top brass believed the U.S., which had not informed Mexico of its probe against the general, had violated Mexico’s sovereignty in arresting Gen. Cienfuegos.</td>

Mr. Biden is also expected to reassert U.S. support for collective defense inside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has been the cornerstone of the 30-nation trans-Atlantic alliance, over which Mr. Trump cast doubt.<br />European officials are hopeful Washington will re-engage with an agreement among allies to curb Iran’s nuclear program—an agreement from which Mr. Trump withdrew—and to pursue a possible wider framework to deal with other Iranian activities the allies believe are a threat to Middle East security.</td>

      <td>Holiday retail sales slump boosts the argument for Biden administration’s stimulus plans</td>
      <td>Retailers could probably use a bit of stimulus around now. They could use an easing of the pandemic even more.<br />The Commerce Department reported December retail sales figures Friday. Calling them “bad” might be an understatement. Overall sales fell 0.7% from a month earlier, worse than the 0.1% decline economists expected the report to show. Even worse, November sales were revised lower, and now show a drop of 1.4% versus the previously reported 1.1% decline.<br />The report quantifies just how hobbling the rise in Covid-19 cases over the past few months has been. For the many retailers that rely heavily on holiday sales, it couldn’t have come at a worse time. While overall sales in December were actually 2.9% above their year-earlier level, thanks to the big rebounds that sellers such as car dealerships experienced earlier in 2020, some retailers are in a very big hole. Department store sales, for example, were down 21.4% on the year last month.<br />Countering the renewed weakness in sales, however, are the payments that many Americans have received as a result of last month’s $900 billion in Covid-19 relief. An analysis of  Bank of America  credit and debit-card data conducted by the firm’s economists showed that card spending in the week ended Jan. 9 was up by 9.7%. Before the payments started going out, card spending was up by about 2% versus a year earlier.<br />Now even more support could be in the offing. President-elect Joe Biden is proposing that most Americans receive an additional $1,400 on top of the $600 approved in December. What actually makes it through Congress might not be that high, but with Democrats about to gain control of the Senate, and some Republicans earlier agitating for bigger checks, it seems likely more money will be on the way.</td>

      <td>A team of WHO researchers has arrived in China but won’t investigate the possibility that the coronavirus originated in a lab.</td>
      <td>In the first week of January, scientists representing the World Health Organization (WHO) were due to arrive in China to trace the origins of Covid-19. The team membership and terms of reference were preapproved by the Chinese government, yet at the last minute Beijing denied entry to the investigators. This prompted WHO to take the rare step of criticizing China, which relented and allowed the group to enter the country this week.<br />The brief standoff highlights a more serious problem: the inadequacy of WHO’s current investigative framework for exploring all plausible origins of Covid-19. The world needs an inquiry that considers not just natural origins but the possibility that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, escaped from a laboratory. The WHO team, however, plans to build on reports by Chinese scientists rather than mount an independent investigation. Given that Chinese authorities have been slow to release information, penalized scientists and doctors who shared clinical and genomic details of the novel coronavirus, and have since demonstrated a keen interest in controlling the narrative of how the virus emerged, this is not a promising foundation for WHO’s investigation.<br />The WHO team includes experts who traced the origins of Ebola and MERS outbreaks, but critics are concerned that it doesn’t have the expertise for an investigation that would examine possible lab origins. Dr. David Relman of Stanford University, who raised the possibility early on that the virus might have leaked from a lab, told us: “Based on the scant information that has been shared publicly about the WHO investigation, it doesn’t appear that WHO has adequately represented the range of views and perspectives of key stakeholders or incorporated all needed forms of expertise.” Responding to whether the WHO team will investigate lab origins, Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, the leader of the team, told us, “If our studies point to a possible lab accident, then other international mechanisms would be involved to document such an event. It would take time and additional types of expertise.”<br />Could the virus have escaped from a laboratory? Then-deputy U.S. national security adviser Matthew Pottinger told international leaders late last year that the latest intelligence points to SARS-CoV-2 having originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). This intelligence has not been made public, and China has denied that the virus came from a lab. Dr. Shi Zhengli, whose lab at WIV has been a suspected source of the virus, told Scientific American last March that “none of the [early SARS-CoV-2] sequences matched those of the viruses her team had sampled from bat caves.”<br />The hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a lab remains controversial. Last March, in the journal Nature Medicine, Dr. Kristian Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute and colleagues asserted that “SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.” They said there was no evidence to support lab-based origins and that the available data was consistent with natural evolution. Dr. David Robertson of the University of Glasgow told us that “SARS-CoV-2 is just too different to the [viruses] we were aware of prior to its emergence.”</td>

      <td>The question: Does anyone want to see on screen what they experience every day?</td>
      <td>At Hollywood’s normal pace, it could take years to set up a movie about a jewel heist starring two Oscar-level actors. “Locked Down,” featuring Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor, was written, shot and wrapped in a few months—mostly because the cast and crew had nothing else to do during the pandemic that froze their industry.<br />“It started from this very crass place: Literally every actor is available,” says director Doug Liman, whose movies include “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” “The Bourne Identity” and “Edge of Tomorrow.” Among the stars with time on their hands for supporting parts: Ben Kingsley, Mindy Kaling and Ben Stiller.<br />“Locked Down,” which hit HBO Max on Thursday, is one of the first releases featuring marquee Hollywood talent filmed during the pandemic and about the pandemic. The question: Does anyone want to see on screen what they experience every day?<br />The movie has a comedic plot about a couple driving each other berserk in their London home during coronavirus confinement. They seize an opportunity to steal a fat diamond from the city’s most extravagant department store, Harrods.<br />To make it, filmmakers had to go a bit guerrilla. The actors signed on even though the script was unfinished. (“I was wondering how they were going to wrap it up in the next 10, 20 pages,” Mr. Ejiofor recalls.) Harrods surprised producers by saying yes to a movie about a heist at the store, and granting them the run of the building. The masked crew rushed through an 18-day shoot in case London went back into real-life lockdown. Mr. Liman decided to fly himself from Martha’s Vineyard to London in his own plane (a single-engine turboprop) for the shoot—partly to eliminate risk of picking up Covid on a commercial flight, partly because he had always wanted to. He made a few stops along the way.</td>

      <td>Past sorrows feed present troubles in Chris Harding Thornton’s “Pickard County Atlas” (MCD, 277 pages, $27), a debut novel set in a fictional Midwestern town in 1978. Madson is a farmed-out place of droughts and dust, “a cusp . . . a spot to fuel up trains in the days of steam.”<br />Madson’s residents are as downtrodden as the topography; they scrape for each dollar, nurse old grudges and hold their grievances close. The town is haunted by the death of seven-year-old Dell Reddick Jr., murdered two decades ago by a farmhand who confessed and then killed himself—but failed to say what he’d done with the victim’s body. When Dell Sr. at last memorializes his first son with a headstone on an empty grave, the locals—especially the Reddick family—suffer fresh psychic wounds.<br />Virginia, the boy’s bitter, pill-abusing mother, is suddenly nowhere to be found. Her surviving son Paul is a 22-year-old with a history of provoking trouble: “Paul knew when misery was stretched taut as it got and sensed just when to pluck it. . . . He went for lost limbs and crushed heads.” Now Paul takes to prowling the grounds of the old home of sheriff’s deputy Harley Jensen, whose own mother killed herself by shotgun when Harley was a boy. The third Reddick brother, Rick, paired with Paul in restoring used mobile homes for their penny-pinching father, steals Paul’s stash of uppers so he can work faster to try to make ends meet.<br />Ill-advised schemes proliferate. Pam, Rick’s desperately discontented wife and the mother of a three-year-old she can’t seem to love, lures the less-than-stable Harley into an after-hours affair. Rick suspects nothing—until he suspects Paul. High on speed, addled by lack of sleep, hallucinating and having visions of his dead brother, Rick strains to discern what’s real and what isn’t.<br />Meanwhile, Madson is experiencing an offbeat-crime wave. Fires break out in several abandoned farmhouses. Newly deceased citizens have their clothes stolen and burned during their own funerals. “Weirder it is, worse it winds up,” warns the sheriff, Harley’s dispirited boss.</td>

The prolific British novelist William Boyd is also a veteran screenwriter, and his experience in that role probably accounts for the strongly cinematic qualities in some of his best fiction.<br />Mr. Boyd’s narrative gifts and film experience blend harmoniously in “Trio,” a novel that tells the braided story of three unhappy souls enmeshed in the filming of a British love story in the seaside town of Brighton in 1968. Readers of a certain age will vividly recall that annus horribilis, which included assassinations, riots, Vietnam, and, in Europe, the student revolt in Paris and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Famously swinging London was a center of the era’s cultural ferment if not its violent upheavals, and some of the period’s social changes are reflected in Mr. Boyd’s eponymous trio.<br />Talbot Kydd, with perhaps the widest lens on the proceedings, is the film’s unhappy producer, an aging World War II veteran with a crooked business partner, a chilly marriage and ulcers. But Talbot’s biggest trouble is that he’s gay and, in the final reel of his life, still closeted. Now he finds himself producing a silly and troublesome film that will tax all his skills and experience. He consoles himself with drink.<br />To Anny Viklund, the pill-popping young American in the starring role, Talbot is a nice man who looks as if he “could have been a retired ambassador, or some high-up museum curator art-expert type, or a rich banker, or a count in a minor, sophisticated aristocracy.” But like the producer, Anny is uncomfortable in her own skin—and a victim of her own decency. Her boyfriend is a prominent anti-colonial intellectual in Paris, but on the set she has fallen in love with her handsome co-star, Troy Blaze. Unfortunately her ex-husband, Cornell Weekes, is an American radical wanted across the pond for a trio of attempted bombings, one of which cost a soldier in Nevada his legs. When Weekes turns up in England looking for cash, Anny borrows it from Talbot and makes the terrible decision to hand it over.<br />Elfrida Wing is the figure at furthest remove from the ill-starred film, but this bit of good fortune is a mere grain of sand in the sea of her troubles. A novelist whose early success led critics to call her “the new Virginia Woolf,” she now hauls around a writer’s block so massive that it’s been a decade since she has written anything. Her husband, the film’s director, is a serial philanderer, and Elfrida is especially rankled to learn that his latest paramour is not merely young and sexy but a talented screenwriter who churns out pages on demand. Elfrida’s alcoholism, meanwhile, is so bad that she has begun to hallucinate.</td>

      <td>The personality of her most famous character, Tom Ripley, echoed a more mysterious creation: Highsmith herself.</td>
      <td>When the Texas-born writer Patricia Highsmith died in 1995 in Locarno, Switzerland, at the age of 74, her literary legacy comprised more than 30 published volumes of fiction, among them “Strangers on a Train” (1950) and “The Talented Mr. Ripley” (1955), arguably her most assured novels of homicidal psychosis and masochistic obsession.<br />There were also 250 unpublished manuscripts, 38 writer’s notebooks and 8,000 pages of journal entries that turned out to be a confounding blend of fact and falsehood. The distinction between the two was, after all, irrelevant to Highsmith. An inveterate dissembler in life and in art, she traversed the boundaries between truth and invention, between passion and cruelty, as easily and often as she crossed state lines and national borders, drinking all the while, and writing, always writing. “If she hadn’t had her work,” one friend told the British biographer and journalist Andrew Wilson, “she would have been sent to an insane asylum or an alcoholic’s home. . . . She was her writing.”<br />Mr. Wilson’s biography “Beautiful Shadow: A Life of Patricia Highsmith” (2003) was the first to chart the writer’s careening, often destructive path from an unstable childhood through literary celebrity to eventual decline, and the book remains a model of thorough research and felicitous insight. Not surprisingly, it is also a depressing portrait of an “extremely hostile and misanthropic” woman who “drove everybody away,” as one former companion attested. A second biography, “The Talented Miss Highsmith: The Secret Life and Serious Art of Patricia Highsmith” (2009), by the American playwright and author Joan Schenkar, was altogether more impressionistic and impassioned, as well as being strikingly rich in detail. Along with 45 pages of footnotes, Ms. Schenkar included, for example, the “Lover Chart” that Highsmith created to rank her female conquests and the fascinating “diagram” for “The Price of Salt,” (published in 1952 under the pseudonym “Claire Morgan” and in 1990, under Highsmith’s name, as “Carol.”) In addition to these substantial biographies, we also have the memoir “Highsmith: A Romance of the 1950s” (2003), written by the novelist Marijane Meaker, one of Highsmith’s erstwhile lovers, along with the various interviews the writer granted and the numerous critiques her work inspired.<br />What, then, remains to be said? Nothing startlingly new, Richard Bradford seems tacitly to concede in “Devils, Lusts and Strange Desires: The Life of Patricia Highsmith,” and yet much that lies unexamined, in particular the intimate link between the writer’s fiction and her own mentality. “As I will show, Highsmith’s novels are a lifelong autobiography,” Mr. Bradford writes. “She was not, like Ripley, a murderous psychopath, but he was shaped by her personality, often as a means of rewriting her life and opinions as a special form of masochism.” Toward his ambitious goal of mapping this connection, Mr. Bradford then sets a straightforward chronological course.<br />“Patricia Highsmith took pride in the history of her maternal grandparents and great-grandparents,” he begins, referring to the Coates family of Alabama, who at one time owned 110 slaves. Slaves who were, Highsmith liked to explain, “not unhappy.” (Her racism, like her virulent anti-Semitism, would in later years become legendary.) The daughter of commercial artists who divorced shortly after her arrival (and whose mother enjoyed repeating the story of her attempts to abort her), Mary Patricia Plangman was born in Fort Worth, Texas on Jan. 19, 1921—a birthday, she liked to note, that she shared with Edgar Allan Poe. In 1924 she acquired a hated stepfather, Stanley Highsmith, who remained a sinister figure in Highsmith’s accounts of her childhood and in her dreamlike recollections of likely sexual abuse. “I learned to live with a grievous and murderous hatred . . . very early on,” she later wrote of her feelings toward her parents.</td>

Thanks to carryout and a $57,000 federal loan, Mr. Pappas managed to avoid going out of business when pandemic lockdowns forced him to suspend indoor dining from March to June. The construction of a tent helped him regain a sizable amount of business over the summer. But business plunged in October when the state ordered restaurants in his county to stop offering indoor dining for a second time; it was banned statewide the following month. Mr. Pappas ignored the mandates and kept serving customers indoors at his 160-seat breakfast and lunch restaurant.<br />Nonetheless, sales remain 60% lower from last year.<br />“I’m not making anything,” said Mr. Pappas, 60 years old. “But at least I’m keeping the place going.”<br />Tensions are growing in parts of the country over on-premises dining and drinking bans, one of the most visible pandemic-related restrictions for many Americans in the crisis’s current phase.</td>

      <td>A populist movement rooted in worries about globalization and alienation from elites culminated in the storming of the Capitol. What can conservatives salvage from the debris?</td>
      <td>At the outset of the 2016 presidential campaign, Chris Christie, then the governor of New Jersey, sensed a yearning within a changed Republican Party for a populist voice—for a political figure who knew how to speak bluntly for the burgeoning ranks of working-class voters in the GOP.<br />So he set out to be that guy: a no-nonsense everyman from outside Washington who talked about the economic travails of a prototypical 45-year-old construction worker, the need to use government aggressively to end the opioid crisis in working America, the virtues of law and order, and the need to “stop the Washington bull.”<br />Mr. Christie was right, in part. The party was ready to move away from traditional conservative formulations and toward a populist message—and even toward somebody who came across as a bit of a bully delivering it. His problem was that the biggest bully with the loudest megaphone turned out to be somebody else: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump won the nomination and the White House with a populist and nationalist message and has led a consequential, tumultuous presidency.<br />That presidency effectively collapsed in flames on Jan. 6, when Mr. Trump sent a crowd of his supporters to the Capitol to stop the constitutional transfer of power to his elected successor. That crowd turned into a mob that ransacked the seat of American democracy and tried to hunt down its elected leaders.<br />Republicans, and the nation as a whole, now are left to ponder what went wrong—and whether such an ugly and violent ending was inevitable. Mr. Christie, who went from Trump rival to informal Trump counselor, thinks that he knows how things went awry. “One of the big concerns I’ve had all the way through the Trump presidency—and I’ve spoken to him about this directly—is that his behavior has obscured his message and his accomplishments,” he says. “And worse than obscuring them, as time went on it was discrediting them.”</td>

      <td>MAKING conference calls from under the covers was once a sick-day anomaly. Now, of course, you can spend a whole workday supine, with your boss none the wiser. But when you blur the borders between desk and duvet, said Brooklyn designer Highlyann Krasnow, “it becomes much more difficult to view the bedroom as a sanctuary.”<br />The need to compromise our inner sanctums so we can WFH has turned Mik Hollis’s pre-Covid pet peeve—TVs and other screens in the bedroom—into a bête noire. Once the factory whistle blows, the Pasadena, Calif., designer said, “homes need at least one space that is a respite from the ubiquity of screens.”<br />Some bedroom-decorating missteps were already bad ideas before the pandemic and remain so now. It’s just that we’re in our homes so much more today, we rub up against these errors more frequently. Here, designers tell us the six most vexing bedroom décor goofs they see people make again and again, and what you should do instead.<br />Want a surefire way to make yourself feel like Alice in Wonderland after the “Eat Me” cake has made her balloon? Cram bulky pieces into your bedroom. Bed platforms that jut out and upholstered head and footboards eat into the space. Of king-size beds, New York architect Barry Goralnick said, “From a design perspective, it’s like parking a station wagon in the bedroom.” Dressers pose a similar predicament, Ms. Krasnow said. People measure height and width but forget about depth, “leaving no room to get around.”<br />Instead: Make pieces do double duty. The top drawer in a bed-adjacent desk or dresser can also house your reading glasses and bottle of melatonin, Ms. Krasnow suggested, and plenty of “case good” furniture that offers storage comes in trim, 18-inch depths. Mr. Goralnick said he opts out of king-size beds entirely, because, “no adult human couple needs more than a queen.”</td>

      <td>BERLIN—The European Union had been struggling to negotiate an investment deal with China for four years, facing opposition from some of its members and, increasingly, the U.S. In the end, it was German Chancellor Angela Merkel who pushed the project across the finish line last month, according to officials familiar with the talks.<br />After the deal was sealed on Dec. 29 in a virtual meeting between EU leaders and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Ms. Merkel held a separate videoconference with Mr. Xi and President Emmanuel Macron of France to finalize the details of an agreement she later described to aides as the flagship achievement of her final year in office.<br />For decades, the legacy of Germany’s Nazi past has kept the country from wielding hard power internationally. Instead, its foreign policy has focused on cultivating good relations with allies and rivals alike to protect the exports its economy depends on.<br />When Ms. Merkel steps down later this year, few expect this to change, potentially complicating President-elect Joe Biden’s plan to build a broad front to rival China. This is despite the election expected Saturday of a new chair of Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union who could ultimately take over from her as chancellor, with one candidate holding markedly more hawkish views than her.<br />Under President Trump, the U.S. shunned its allies to engage directly with China to try to improve the terms of its economic relationship with the Asian giant. But now, just as Mr. Biden calls for a collective approach to China from Western democracies, the EU and Germany, having struck their own bilateral deal with Beijing, are unlikely to look back.</td>

      <td>Investors have high hopes for the new financial-data giant created by the imminent merger of London Stock Exchange Group and Refinitiv</td>
      <td>A new financial data giant will be born in the coming weeks, and investors are cooing. Living up to their hopes could be hard work.<br />This week,  London Stock Exchange Group  got the green light from European Union antitrust officials to proceed with its takeover of Refinitiv, a full 18 months after the $15 billion all-share tie-up was announced. This was the last major hurdle for a deal that will bring together financial-market plumbing and data services. The transaction is now expected to complete within weeks.<br />Financial data is a hot sector. Shares in listed providers S&P Global and  FactSet Research Systems  are up by roughly two-thirds over three years and trade for 26 and 28 times prospective earnings respectively, according to the latter—more than the wider market. Investors have even higher expectations for LSE: Its stock changes hands for 37 times, having risen almost 150% in dollar terms over three years.<br />The underlying reason is strong demand for financial information. Users want it to identify trading signals, design portfolios, feed automated trading systems, better assess risk, track regulatory compliance and improve operations. Market-data revenues grew roughly 6% in both 2018 and 2019, according to consulting firm Burton-Taylor. Bloomberg and Refinitiv are the market leaders, and smaller players have been consolidating. S&P Global agreed late last year to buy  IHS Markit ,  itself the product of a 2016 merger.<br />The fourth-largest exchange company globally by market capitalization, LSE focuses on trading, post-trade clearing, and information services including the FTSE Russell index group. That data business contributed around 40% of revenue and profit last year, and will be a greater share after LSE sells its Italian business, a concession made to secure EU merger approval. Privately held Refinitiv collects, consolidates and sells data, primarily via its Eikon terminals and linked data-feeds, and has fixed-income and currency-trading platforms.</td>

The suspensions came partly in response to a video Mr. Trump uploaded to social media amid the attack on the U.S. Capitol that reiterated unsubstantiated claims the election was stolen and expressed support for the pro-Trump mob.<br />Although Twitter lifted Mr. Trump’s suspension the following day, the company then issued a permanent ban for subsequent tweets he posted.<br />Several high-ranking White House officials, as well as the White House itself, have official social-media accounts, but none come close to the reach of Mr. Trump’s personal accounts. On Twitter, for example, neither the official White House nor the official POTUS account, which stands for President of the United States and is held by the sitting president, has amassed even half the followers Mr. Trump himself has.<br />Other top social platforms, including Twitch and YouTube, have followed Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat’s lead, either temporarily or indefinitely suspending Mr. Trump’s accounts.</td>

      <td>Companies are bracing for further regulation under the incoming Biden administration. One area that could affect a number of industries: potential new requirements related to diversity, carbon emissions and other types of sustainability metrics.<br />President-elect Joe Biden campaigned on requiring companies to provide more detail on environmental risks and greenhouse-gas emissions as part of a broader agenda to combat climate change. He laid out a multipronged plan to address longstanding racial inequality. And he has said he would hold corporate executives personally accountable, including jail time where merited, for violations such as corporate pollution that affect the health and safety of workers and surrounding communities.<br />Jon Hale, head of sustainability research at Morningstar, says any moves by the Biden administration would follow calls from many others seeking environmental, social and governance, or ESG, regulations.<br />“It’s not just investors demanding it; all other stakeholders—workers, customers, clients, the communities you operate in—they are expecting a higher standard from companies in the way that they operate,” he says. “In virtually every industry, there’s a unique set of ESG issues that are material to that industry.”<br />Businesses and trade groups have been requesting meetings with Mr. Biden’s agency review teams and incoming staff to build relationships, get clarity on expected policies and make their own pitches for potential rules, according to Biden transition officials, executives and trade groups. So far, the Biden team has been listening and asking questions, the transition officials say.</td>

      <td>The president-elect’s plan could rapidly cut unemployment—but at a hefty price</td>
      <td>There are two ways for the federal government to address income inequality. One is to redistribute more money to people at the bottom of the income ladder. The other is to use the tools of fiscal and monetary policy to drive unemployment low enough to drive up demand and wages for those workers.<br />President-elect Joe Biden is trying to do both. A sizable chunk of the $1.9 trillion fiscal plan he laid out Thursday is aimed at lower-income people, and, in combination with ultralow interest rates and widespread vaccination, the stimulus could drive down unemployment far faster than after any other recent recession.<br />Mr. Biden proposed raising the child tax credit 50% to $3,000 or more for the year and making it refundable, meaning families who owe less tax than the credit would get a check for the difference. He would extend and boost enhanced weekly unemployment insurance benefits by $100 from the $300 in December’s stimulus package to $400. He would extend a 15% increase in food stamps through the summer, raise the maximum earned-income tax credit for childless adults by nearly $1,000 and extend it to more people.<br />Those steps, plus adding $1,400 to the $600-per-adult checks approved in December, would slash the poverty rate from 12.6% to 9%, or by more than 11 million people, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University. The number of children in poverty would drop by half, or 5 million.<br />Then there’s the macroeconomic impact. If Mr. Biden’s proposal is enacted, it would, along with $900 billion in December and previous measures, add $5.3 trillion to deficits, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That’s a staggering 25% of gross domestic product.</td>

      <td>Bank’s profit edges up 4%, though revenue falls nearly 10% in fourth quarter</td>
      <td>Wells Fargo  & Co.’s profit rose 4% in the final three months of the year.<br />The San Francisco-based lender said Friday that it made $2.99 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $2.87 billion a year earlier. Per-share profit totaled 64 cents, compared with analyst forecasts of 59 cents.<br />Wells Fargo’s results reflect a topsy-turvy year in which the pandemic-induced recession forced lenders to sock away tens of billions of dollars to prepare for a wave of soured loans. The bank released $757 million from its pile of reserves in the fourth quarter, largely because it no longer had to stow away cash on a book of student loans it sold.<br />Net charge-offs remained low at $584 million, down almost a quarter from a year earlier. So far, the government’s expanded unemployment, stimulus checks, small business relief and loan deferral programs have staved off widespread loan losses, but bank executives caution they could still be coming.<br />With banks so far weathering the crisis, regulators at the Federal Reserve said last month they could start buying back their own stock again, though total shareholder returns are limited to the quarterly profit they generated over the past year. Wells Fargo said its board approved the repurchase of an additional 500 million shares.</td>

Contracts tied to the Nasdaq-100 wavered between gains and losses, and those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5%.<br />The S&P 500 is on track to end the week lower, erasing some of the gains made in early January when the gauge rallied to a record high. Markets have for weeks cheered Democrats’ plans to expand government spending and bolster the economic rebound. But the size of Mr. Biden’s plans, laid out late Thursday, served to check some of that optimism.<br />“The magnitude obviously was surprising on the upside,” said Wei Li, head of investment strategy for  BlackRock ’s  exchange-traded fund and index investments for Europe, Middle East and Africa. “With the Senate majority, [taxes] could be coming in the medium term and that is something the market has to assess as well.”<br />Ahead of the opening bell,  JPMorgan Chase  shares edged down less than 1%. The bank on Friday reported its highest-ever quarterly profit, though its full-year earnings fell 20%. Shares of Wells Fargo fell 3.7% after its revenue fell more than forecast, with lower interest rates weighing on net interest income.

Like its big bank peers, Citigroup enjoyed strong results from its Wall Street operations, but that was offset by the billions of dollars the bank had to put aside for potentially bad loans.<br />In a sign its outlook on the economy has improved, Citigroup drew down $1.5 billion of the reserves the bank had put aside for future loan losses, a big reason the bank’s profit was better than expected.</td>

      <td>Sick of the same old spaghetti? Try red-wine pasta with chestnuts and pancetta, or fettuccine with a luscious mushroom ragù. 5 quick, comforting recipes that put the new back in noodles.</td>
      <td>WHEN IT COMES to ease, speed, thrift, comfort, satisfaction and sheer belovedness, can any food compete with pasta? And yet, for all those good reasons, it’s easy to get into a pasta rut, rotating through the same standard sauces on autopilot. With that in mind, each of the recipes provided here incorporates an unexpected ingredient or a technique that surprises.<br />In the recipe for red-wine pasta with pancetta and chestnuts at right, the pasta finishes cooking in the red wine, drinking it up, which gives the glistening noodles a gorgeous burgundy hue and a rare depth of flavor. It’s an elegant dish, taking a weeknight pasta somewhere a bit more sumptuous. Using jarred chestnuts makes this a quick recipe—no need to peel the nuts, a terribly fussy business. Making this dish also happens to be a good way to use up leftover red wine, if you have a few open bottles. While a Tuscan red might be the most natural choice for a pasta sauce, I find a fruit-forward California Cabernet marries well with the natural sweetness of the chestnuts.<br />A few of these recipes come from restaurants I’ve sorely missed during lockdown. In her strozzapreti with carrots, Lena Ciardullo, executive chef of Union Square Café in New York, situates the carrot, normally a supporting player, at center stage. She roasts her carrots with fennel and ground coriander, then combines them with crisp pancetta, charred scallions, Fresno peppers and basil. A generous cup of stracciatella—the luxuriously rich center of a ball of burrata cheese—provides a tangy creaminess that counters the sweetness of the roasted carrots.<br />At Lilia in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, chef-proprietor Missy Robbins rethinks a classic cacio e pepe, swapping in pink peppercorns for the usual black ones. Pink peppercorns are actually berries and unrelated, botanically, to black pepper. They do have a peppery flavor: a slightly floral blooming heat that teases the palate. (One word of warning: Pink peppercorns are in the cashew family and should be avoided by anyone allergic to tree nuts.) To emulsify the sauce, Ms. Robbins simply adds pasta water to a little melted butter and stirs for a few moments, making this perhaps the fastest pasta sauce I know. Mafaldine is a long, flat and wide pasta with a ruffle to its edges. If you can’t find it, use another ribbonlike pasta such as fettuccine or tagliatelle.<br />Nancy Silverton, the Los Angeles doyenne of all things pasta—and, for that matter, pizza and bread—makes ingenious use of leftover bread to thicken a sauce of olive oil, garlic and chile flakes. It’s economical, speedy and requires no skill. Simply fry breadcrumbs in good olive oil. Reserve a portion of them to be added at the end for texture and crunch; cook the remainder in a bit of pasta water until they melt, along with the garlic, into a smooth sauce. The result is at once garlicky and gentle, soft and crisp. Most likely, it will not require a trip to the grocery store.</td>

      <td>LONDON—In a resounding win for insurance policyholders, the U.K. Supreme Court on Friday ruled that insurers must pay out disputed claims related to the coronavirus to a range of businesses, ending a legal case spanning months and potentially setting a precedent for other jurisdictions.<br />The Supreme Court dismissed insurers’ appeals brought after a High Court ruling in September found mostly in favor of policyholders. The Financial Conduct Authority, the country’s securities watchdog, had brought that test case to resolve uncertainties surrounding business-interruption cover.<br />The case has been watched closely, as millions of companies world-wide lodge claims and grapple with their insurance companies. In the U.S., legal battles over business-interruption policies have unfurled across states, leading to various judgments. Of the roughly 100 rulings in suits between businesses and their insurers, about three-quarters have found in favor of insurers, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.<br />At the time of the High Court ruling, the FCA said the judgment found that most, but not all, of the clauses considered by the court provide cover. The ruling Friday draws a line under the matter and could affect up to 370,000 policyholders with billions of pounds of claims. Though only eight insurers were parties to the test case, the regulator expects the decision to apply to all insurers in its remit.<br />“Today’s judgment decisively removes many of the roadblocks to claims by policyholders,” said Sheldon Mills, executive director, consumers and competition at the FCA.</td>

      <td>Fearing the import of new coronavirus strains, one state wants to repurpose remote camps designed for resources workers</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—Australia has relied on one of the world’s most aggressive quarantine programs to keep the coronavirus at bay. Now, one leader wants to go further by housing returned travelers in Outback camps far from cities as new Covid-19 variants threaten the country’s success.<br />The premier of Queensland state wants to repurpose camps designed for resources workers as isolation hubs in remote scrubland where temperatures can top 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It follows an outbreak of a highly contagious coronavirus strain at a quarantine hotel in Brisbane, Australia’s third-largest city and the state capital, with a population of about 2.5 million people.<br />“I think with this new strain, we have to put all options on the table, and these are sensible, rational options,” said Annastacia Palaszczuk, who was re-elected as Queensland premier in late October in part due to her center-left government’s tough measures to contain Covid-19.<br />The idea of using remote camps illustrates how leaders in places that had crushed the virus are considering more extreme measures to protect people from new variants of the coronavirus, which emerged in the U.K. and South Africa and have since spread to more countries. Currently, travelers returning to Australia are housed in hotels, often close to city airports, for 14 days.<br />Queensland was on a run of almost four months without a case of local transmission when a cleaner at a quarantine hotel in Brisbane tested positive for the new U.K. variant. More cases followed, and 129 people who were isolating were soon moved to another hotel and had their quarantine extended.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—Russia announced its intention to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, citing Washington’s decision to leave the agreement and a lack of progress in working out acceptable terms for Moscow’s continued participation in the agreement that allowed Russia and the West to carry out unarmed reconnaissance flights over each other’s territories.<br />The withdrawal will complicate any potential efforts from President-elect Joe Biden to re-enter the treaty after President Trump left it in 2020.<br />Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last year that European nations that remained in the treaty should sign a legally binding document affirming they would allow Russian planes fly over U.S. bases on their territory and wouldn’t share the data they collect on their flights over Russian territory with Washington.<br />“Due to the lack of progress in removing obstacles for the continued functioning of the agreement under new conditions, the Russian Foreign Ministry is authorized to announce the beginning of the withdrawal,” the ministry said Friday.<br />Write to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com</td>

      <td>North Korea sees its nuclear program as essential to regime survival, serving to deter a U.S.-led invasion. Decades of denuclearization talks, economic sanctions and diplomacy have done little to slow Pyongyang’s advance to becoming a self-declared nuclear state.<br />One of the world’s poorest and most-isolated countries, North Korea has managed to stay high on Washington’s list of foreign-policy priorities for years. It spends more on its military, as a ratio of gross domestic product, than any other of the 170 countries tracked by the U.S. State Department.<br />Pyongyang developed its weapons program brazenly, flouting sanctions and breaking promises to halt nuclear production. In 2003 it withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the main global commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.<br />At 2018’s Singapore summit with President Trump, Kim Jong Un greatly boosted his global legitimacy by becoming the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting U.S. leader. In 2017 Pyongyang had ratcheted up tensions with the U.S. to their highest level in years by conducting its sixth nuclear test and firing off three intercontinental ballistic missiles—the last of them showing the range to strike anywhere in the U.S.<br />The U.S. Army in July said North Korea may now have 20 to 60 nuclear bombs and the ability to manufacture six new bombs each year. In October, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic-missile programs remain “a serious threat to the security and stability of the region and the world.”</td>

With more people working from home, some expect less traffic and more space for parks or pedestrianized spaces.<br />Campaigners in Paris, though, have been pressing for years to do something about the Champs-Élysées, named for the Elysian fields, the ancient Greeks’ idea of the afterlife. Some 72% of the estimated 100,000 pedestrians who visit the area each day are tourists, while 22% work there. Only 6% or less are Parisians.</td>

      <td>Medical-gear makers are sharing production information and receiving protection from antitrust scrutiny, the companies and federal officials said, part of government efforts to better coordinate the distribution of N95 masks and other supplies.<br />The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it convened major N95 producers, distributors and buyers last week for a first meeting to discuss the mask supply chain. That group is a subset of nearly 60 companies and trade groups that will share information on production, distribution and pricing for in-demand medical products, FEMA said.<br />The agreement is part of the federal government’s efforts to better coordinate the production and distribution of medical-grade face masks, which have become critical equipment for people treating Covid-19 patients. The effort includes big manufacturers, such as  3M Co.  and  Honeywell  International Inc., both of which have ramped up production of N95s and other protective gear this year. Masks and other gear remain in short supply as Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations hover near peak levels across much of the country.<br />The project is operating under a provision of the Defense Production Act that allows the federal government to consult with businesses for emergency preparedness and response. President Trump invoked that part of the law by executive order in March.<br />The agreement provides participants with protection from potential antitrust lawsuits for cooperating as part of the agreement, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are overseeing the meetings to ensure that the cooperation and data-sharing steers as clear as possible of anticompetitive practices, the group’s agreement states. Companies aren’t typically allowed to hold such detailed discussions about production plans with competitors.</td>

It owns Alipay, a mobile payments and lifestyle app used by more than one billion people in China and that handled more than $17 trillion worth of transactions in the year to June 2020. Ant in recent years has also become a big facilitator of online loans to consumers and small businesses, and sells a range of insurance and investment products to Alipay users.</td>

      <td>Remarks made by key Democratic senators lend oxygen to some progressive wish list items</td>
      <td>READING THE TEA LEAVES on possible major structural changes to Senate rules, statehood for the District of Columbia, and expanding the federal judiciary: Remarks by key Democratic senators in recent days lend oxygen to some progressive wish list items while likely dooming others.  Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told a Buffalo news outlet he was interested in expanding the number of federal district court judges, framing it as a local issue: “There’s a real shortage [of federal judges] in Western New York, and it is one of the things we’ll look at,” Schumer said.<br />Progressive activists would be thrilled, but some, including the group Take Back the Court, continue to press for an expansion of the conservative-majority Supreme Court. In a letter to Biden this week they warn that if his courts commission isn’t supportive of a major overhaul it will “help slam shut the window of opportunity before it is truly open.” Republicans and some Democrats oppose expanding the high court, partly because they believe it would set off a partisan race to keep expanding it further. Biden hasn’t taken a firm position on expanding the court but has called the court system “out of whack” and plans to convene a group of scholars to issue overhaul recommendations within 180 days.<br />Statehood for the District of Columbia and possibly Puerto Rico remains a live issue, though one possible Democratic opponent, Sen. Joe Manchin, said he “wants to see the pros and cons” of that issue. Adding the two states could result in four more Democratic senators. Forty-three Senate Democrats are on the record supporting D.C. statehood, and no other current Democratic senators have said they definitively oppose it.<br />Statehood would likely require eliminating the legislative filibuster, but Manchin and others who oppose that could support a rule change that only eliminated it for statehood votes, like previous rule changes that eliminated the 60-vote threshold for executive branch and judicial nominations.<br />2022 SENATE RACES have already begun, just days after the final contest of the 2020 cycle concluded in Georgia. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman announced a possible run last Friday, and within 72 hours said he had raised over $500,000. He is targeting the seat to be vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. GOP former Rep. Ryan Costello sharply criticized Fetterman’s record and said if he decided to run, he’d “smoke Fetterman in the suburbs.” But that would mean first winning a GOP primary, where Costello’s frequent criticisms of President Trump will test the soon-to-be-former president’s grip on the future of his party.</td>

      <td>The pet industry is attractive, but investors need to be choosy as the pandemic adoption boom tails off</td>
      <td>It is hard to leave the house these days without crossing paths with one of Covid-19’s more appealing legacies: the lockdown puppy. Signs that pet ownership increased during the pandemic are positive for stocks like Chewy, but investors can no longer buy any story fronted by a cute animal.<br />Pet brands have become a bright spot for some of the world’s biggest food businesses.  Nestlé ’s  pet-care division was its top performer over the nine months through September, growing sales by 10.6% compared with the same period a year earlier. Sales of  General Mills ’ premium Blue Buffalo brand increased 18% in its latest quarter. Online pet-products retailer Chewy and specialist food producer Freshpet also have experienced strong demand.<br />Globally, the pet-care business probably grew by 7% in 2020, according to an estimate from Euromonitor, which expects annual growth to remain around 6% through 2025. One explanation for the rosy outlook is that the pandemic likely boosted the size of the pet population in key markets.<br />Although the results of annual head counts won’t be available until the spring, global pet-food leader Mars, whose brands include Pedigree and Whiskas, estimates that 85 million U.S. households owned a pet at the beginning of 2020, and that around 11 new million pets were added over the year. British retailer Pets at Home thinks the U.K. pet population may have grown by 2% to 3%.<br />Those numbers might have been stronger but for supply constraints. U.S. shelters were emptied of animals early in the pandemic and breeders struggled to rear enough youngsters to meet demand. A seller’s market pushed up prices. In Britain, a Dachshund puppy could have been purchased for £970 back in March, roughly $1,320 at current exchange rates. By October, when “puppy inflation” peaked, the same dog was more than 70% more expensive, according to animal-welfare charity Dogs Trust.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S.-China trade pact signed a year ago is being credited for improving business conditions for some American companies, even if a cornerstone of the deal—China’s commitment to greatly increase purchases of U.S. goods—has fallen short.<br />Under the deal brokered by the Trump administration, China agreed to purchase about $159 billion in U.S. goods by the end of 2020. Through November, China’s actual purchases were about $82 billion, or about 52% of the target goal, according to an analysis by Chad Bown, a senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics.<br />Economists have attributed the shortfall in part to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which dented Chinese domestic demand for foreign goods and lowered the prices of imported energy.<br />The trade pact signed Jan. 15, 2020, also called on China to improve access to its markets to U.S. companies—and on that front, Beijing has made strides, especially with respect to American financial companies.<br />In exchange, the Trump administration agreed to cut tariffs on some imported Chinese products. Still, import duties remain on about $370 billion in Chinese goods annually, affecting most imports.</td>

      <td>A new way of stock-market wagering is taking hold among younger investors who prefer to think about how much they can spend instead of how many shares they can afford.</td>
      <td>Purchasing a piece of Apple or Tesla once meant calculating how many shares you could afford to buy. That no longer matters. Now you can pay whatever you’re willing to spend, even if that amounts to pocket change.<br />Thinking primarily about dollars instead of shares represents a dramatic shift in the world of personal finance, posing new opportunities and risks for investors. The practice is gaining momentum thanks to the widespread adoption of fractional trading—which allows investors to purchase slivers of traditional shares—as well as an industry push to reduce online trading fees to zero.<br />These twin developments made it easier and more cost effective for new investors to wager as little as $1 on stocks. The volatility of the coronavirus pandemic then turbocharged these bets as market leaders like Apple Inc. and  Tesla Inc.  soared into the hundreds or thousands of dollars. The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up 73% since its intraday low point in March 2020.<br />The lineup of wealth managers catering to dollar-focused investors is spreading from upstart online brokerages that rely on flashy apps to industry stalwarts that have longstanding bricks-and-mortar offices around the U.S. One of those giants, Fidelity Investments, launched a service early in 2020 called Stocks by the Slice allowing investors to purchase fractional shares for the first time. When Stocks by the Slice launched last February, 75% of the buy trades from investors using the service were in dollars on average. This month Fidelity now says that figure is closer to 85%.<br />In the future “retail investors will be thinking 100% in dollars, not in shares,” said Scott Ignall, head of Fidelity’s retail brokerage business. “Clients no longer need to use a calculator to figure out how many shares of stock they want to buy.”</td>

The change was recently ordered by Mr. Trump but hasn’t yet been made public. A Biden transition official declined to comment on the move.<br />U.S. military responsibility for Israel had long been allocated to its European command. That arrangement enabled U.S. generals in the Middle East to interact with Arab states without having a close association with Israel, which at the time was seen as an adversary in the Arab world.<br />Following the Abraham Accords that led to the normalization of Israel’s relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, pro-Israel groups have stepped up their push to have the Central Command take on responsibility for military operations and planning involving Israel to foster greater cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors.</td>

      <td>Decision effectively ends push to ensure that mortgage giants eventually return to private hands</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department has decided not to restructure the taxpayers’ stake in  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac ,  effectively ending the Trump administration’s push to ensure that the mortgage giants are eventually returned to private hands.<br />The announcement by the Treasury Department and the companies’ federal regulator leaves it to the incoming Biden administration to decide the future of the firms, which were put under government control during the 2008-09 financial crisis through a process known as conservatorship.<br />Advisers close to President-elect Joe Biden have said he would be in no hurry to privatize the companies, which guarantee roughly half of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market. Instead, Mr. Biden would focus on ways to use the companies to boost housing affordability and promote homeownership, the advisers said.<br />Under a more modest agreement announced Thursday by the Treasury Department and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the mortgage companies will be allowed to retain more of their earnings, boosting their ability to absorb potential losses. FHFA is the companies’ independent federal regulator.<br />Thursday’s changes to the companies’ bailout agreements allow the firms to retain roughly $280 billion, or the equivalent of what they are required to maintain as part of new, banklike capital rules set by the FHFA in November.</td>

      <td>Man carrying Confederate flag in Capitol was also charged</td>
      <td>Federal prosecutors escalated their efforts Thursday to target some of the more brazen violent conduct from last week’s attack on the U.S. Capitol, charging a retired firefighter who they say threw a fire extinguisher at three police officers and another man who allegedly beat a police officer repeatedly with an American flag.<br />Robert Sanford of Chester, Pa., faces charges including assaulting a police officer after he was allegedly identified as the person who lobbed a fire extinguisher on the west side of the Capitol, at around 2:30 p.m., as the mob crashed past a thin line of Capitol police officers and stormed toward the building on Jan. 6.<br />Around the same time, a radio dispatch captured by OpenMHZ, a platform that records radio chatter from law enforcement and other agencies, relayed: “There is a 10-33 at the Capitol building. It has been breached,” using a code that signifies an emergency in which an officer needs assistance.<br />The prosecution’s statement of facts in the case described the fire extinguisher hitting three officers in the head, including one who wasn’t wearing a helmet. Officials said the extinguisher Mr. Sanford allegedly threw isn’t the one that killed Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was also struck in the head with a fire extinguisher during the unrest and died from his wounds, officials said.<br />William Young, one of the officers who was hit in the incident allegedly involving Mr. Sanford, was evaluated at a hospital and cleared to return to duty, the charging document said. A friend of Mr. Sanford tipped off the FBI to his involvement, the document said, adding that he was around 55 years old and had recently retired from the Chester Fire Department.</td>

      <td>President-elect will urge Congress to back $1,400 per-person direct payments and ask for funding for testing and vaccine distribution</td>
      <td>President-elect Joe Biden plans to call for a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan to help Americans weather the economic shock of the pandemic and pump more money into testing and vaccine distribution, according to senior incoming Biden administration officials.<br />Mr. Biden in a speech Thursday evening plans to lay out priorities related to the pandemic for the early days of his administration. He will urge Congress to back a round of $1,400-per-person direct payments to most households, a $400-per-week unemployment insurance supplement through September, expanded paid leave and increases in the child tax credit. Aid for households makes up about half of the plan’s cost, with much of the rest going to vaccine distribution and state and local governments.<br />Mr. Biden, a Democrat, is set to take office on Wednesday as the virus death toll has topped 3,000 daily deaths repeatedly in recent weeks and the country deals with the economic fallout from continued business and school closures. The Senate is also expected to hold a trial after the House impeached President Trump for the second time.<br />Mr. Biden wants Congress to act quickly to address what he sees as a national emergency, the officials said. The plan includes some ideas previously floated by congressional Democrats and Mr. Biden’s campaign that Republicans have rejected—including raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour—and it isn’t clear which pieces can become law and how soon lawmakers will act. Most legislation needs 60 votes in the Senate, which would require Republican votes since Democrats will control 50 seats.<br />“We will get right to work to turn President-elect Biden’s vision into legislation that will pass both chambers and be signed into law,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said in a joint statement.</td>

      <td>Her first bills in the new Congress would dilute ballot integrity and make D.C. a state.</td>
      <td>After impeaching Donald Trump again, what do Democrats want to do with their new dominance of Washington? It’s revealing that Speaker Nancy’s Pelosi’s first legislative priority is cementing Democratic political power.<br />Last week House Democrats reintroduced as H.R.1 a voting and campaign-finance bill that would grease the Democratic voting machine nationwide and restrict political opposition. They also introduced a bill to provide statehood for the District of Columbia that would guarantee Democrats two new Senate seats.<br />H.R.1 imposes California-style election rules nationwide. The bill requires every state to register voters based on names in state and federal databases—such as anyone receiving food stamps or who interacts with a state DMV. It mandates same-day and online voter registration, expands mail and early voting, and limits states’ ability to remove voters from rolls. Overall the bill is designed to auto-enroll likely Democratic voters, enhance Democratic turnout, with no concern for ballot integrity.<br />The bill also strips state legislatures of their role in drawing congressional districts, replacing them with commissions that are ostensibly independent. In practice commissions have turned out mostly to favor Democrats, as in New Jersey and California. If states want such commissions, so be it. But this is an attempt to impose one Pelosi standard from coast to coast.<br />H.R.1’s campaign-finance provisions would also limit the political speech of conservatives and Republicans. The bill requires some nonprofits to disclose publicly the names of donors who give more than $10,000, even if those groups aren’t taking part in candidate elections. The left’s pressure groups and media will then stigmatize donors. The bill also raises disclosure requirements for political ads on radio and TV, requiring the head of an organization to approve messages and list the group’s top donors by name.</td>

      <td>The politicization of technology jeopardizes the ‘open internet’ itself.</td>
      <td>We’ve criticized  Twitter  CEO Jack Dorsey’s political speech controls, especially the October blackout of a New York Post story that reflected poorly on the Biden campaign. Many of the impulsive political intrusions by technology companies have done more to embitter American debate than to clean it up. But credit to Mr. Dorsey for at least reflecting on his decisions and the new world the tech titans are creating.<br />In a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday, Mr. Dorsey commented on Twitter’s banning of President Trump, and the crushing of Parler, Twitter’s competitor, in the wake of the Capitol riot. The CEO maintained that his ban on Mr. Trump was necessary but expressed unease about “the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.”<br />That’s when it got interesting. “The check and accountability on this power,” Mr. Dorsey explained, had been that “if folks do not agree with our rules and enforcement, they can simply go to another internet service.” But “this concept was challenged last week when a number of foundational internet providers also decided not to host what they found dangerous.”<br />Some users who chafed at Twitter’s clear left-wing slant amid the election had created accounts on Parler, which didn’t moderate content as aggressively. But then in one weekend Parler was wiped out, first by  Apple  blocking it from its App Store, then by Google doing the same, and then by  Amazon ’s  Web Services withdrawing access to its cloud network.<br />Mr. Dorsey thinks this may be necessary, but conceded that “over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet.” He added that further changes to Twitter “can’t erode a free and open global internet.”</td>
