      <td>The action comes under the Deferred Enforced Departure program that offers deportation protections and work permits to immigrants in the country without authorization</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—As one of his final acts in office, President Trump has authorized a program to give work permits and deportation protections to Venezuelan immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission, an action President-elect Joe Biden had promised to take during the 2020 campaign.<br />The designation formally known as Deferred Enforced Departure offers legal protections to any Venezuelan national present in the U.S. as of Jan. 20, 2021, for 18 months. That is likely to benefit at least 94,000 Venezuelans in the country without authorization as of 2018, according to the Migration Policy Institute, though analysts believe the current number is likely higher.<br />Mr. Trump’s move is seen as a form of pressure the U.S. government can use against Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan authoritarian leader whom the Trump administration has targeted with sanctions, a limited travel ban and other measures. In Jan. 2019, the U.S. officially recognized the country’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s interim president.<br />During the 2020 campaign, Mr. Biden said he would offer Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelan immigrants should he win the election, addressing a major ask of the Venezuelan-American community in Florida that he was courting. TPS is roughly identical to the Deferred Enforced Departure program in the protections it offers. DED is issued directly by a president, while TPS must be approved by the Homeland Security secretary.<br />Republicans and Democrats in Florida have been lobbying for the move—south Florida is home to one of the largest Venezuelan populations in the U.S.—and the White House has long waffled over whether to take the step.</td>

      <td>The Justice Department won’t pursue charges against GOP Sen. Richard Burr after ending its investigation of stock trades he made in advance of the coronavirus market turmoil last year, the North Carolina lawmaker said.<br />“The Department of Justice informed me that it has concluded its review of my personal financial transactions conducted early last year,” Mr. Burr said Tuesday. “The case is now closed. I’m glad to hear it. My focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of North Carolina during this difficult time for our nation.”<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation began looking into reports in March that several members of Congress, their spouses or their investment advisers sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock after lawmakers attended closed-door briefings about the threat posed by the virus as it was beginning to reach the U.S. Some of those trades spared lawmakers as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses as stocks sank by mid-March.<br />Mr. Burr, who sat on two committees that received detailed briefings on the growing pandemic, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, which he had chaired, had sold shares of companies valued at as much as $1.7 million, which he owned with his wife. The sale saved the couple at least $250,000 in losses based on what those stocks were worth at the close of trading March 19, the Journal reported at the time.<br />Mr. Burr had said he made the trades based on news reports out of Asia rather than any inside information he had received, but he stepped down from his post as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee while the investigation continued.</td>

The first wave of applications was largely handled by community and small lenders after the SBA set aside time for them to process the loans exclusively.<br />The program’s restart comes as many small businesses continue to struggle with the fallout from the pandemic. One-third of small businesses surveyed between Jan. 4 and Jan. 10 said they would need financial assistance or additional capital in the next six months, according to the Census Bureau, up from nearly 25% in mid-November.<br />“It’s encouraging to see that kind of volume go out the door, especially knowing that it can only go up from here,” said John Lettieri, chief executive of the nonprofit Economic Innovation Group. But small businesses have waited for a long time for that lifeline and some that could have been salvaged have failed, he said.<br />The average PPP loan size was below $20,000 for first-time borrowers and below $75,000 for second-time borrowers for applications processed through Jan. 17, according to an SBA spokesman, a sign the loans were being approved for smaller businesses. Loan amounts are based on the size of an applicant’s payroll.</td>

      <td>Streaming giant tempers subscriber outlook with surprising cash flow projection</td>
      <td>All its years in Hollywood have clearly taught  Netflix  the value of tweaking the screenplay.<br />Wall Street’s script for Netflix has been simple to date: a singular focus on user numbers. And the streaming giant has clearly delivered on that recently, thanks in part to the pandemic that confined people to their homes. The company said Tuesday that it added a record 36.5 million paid subscribers in 2020, with fourth-quarter additions of 8.5 million subscribers beating its own projection by 42%. Over the previous five years, Netflix had averaged about 22.5 million paid subscriber additions annually.<br />But the unique circumstances of Netflix’s recent pace mean it is very unlikely to continue. Indeed, Netflix projected only 6 million subscriber additions for the first quarter, matching the low end of Wall Street’s forecasts. But the company offset the disappointment with the target of breaking even on a free-cash-flow basis this year, compared with its earlier projection of burning as much as $1 billion. The company even bolded a claim in its quarterly letter to shareholders that it believes it will no longer need to raise external financing for its day-to-day operations. Its shares were up more than 13% following the report.<br />The reaction suggests Netflix and its investors are ready to grow up a bit. The company has burned cash since 2013 in a race to build up exclusive content on the correct assumption that studios that produced top-flight programming would eventually create their own streaming outlets. That has played out vividly over the past 18 months with the launch of services such as Disney+, HBO Max and Peacock. New rivals also have cost Netflix access to popular comfort-viewing programs such as “Friends” and “The Office.”<br />Fortunately, Netflix now has plenty of popular shows of its own. Moreover, the company’s tenure in streaming gives it unique insight into what audiences actually want to see. Who else would have given the green light to a hit show with washed-up “Karate Kid” characters?</td>

      <td>Have the social-media platforms gone too far or acted too late? Students debate.</td>
      <td>Editor’s note: This week’s Future View discusses censorship on social media. For next week, we’ll ask students to make the case for one policy change that Joe Biden should prioritize in his first 100 days in office. Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Jan. 26. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Tell the Truth<br />There are three dominant narratives on the social-media censorship. The first is that social-media companies are private enterprises and should be able to censor speech as they deem fit. The second is that social media has become so vital to the exercise of speech that it has become part of the public square. And just as a town clerk isn’t allowed to deny a permit to a demonstration because he finds its subject matter objectionable, so too social-media companies must be constrained from censoring speech. The third also begins with the premise that social media has become highly influential, but concludes that platforms have a duty to stamp out whatever they (frequently progressives) find unsavory. That town clerk should take a stand and deny the permit.<br />I’d emphasize the private nature of social-media companies, and add that they should be held to their own standards. If they profess to be grand, benevolent platforms that are welcoming to all, then they should behave accordingly by allowing disagreeable speech to flourish. If, however, they purport to be platforms for progressive speech, then censoring conservatives is their prerogative. Content moderation is fine, as long as companies are honest with themselves—and us.</td>

      <td>By his own instincts, or the desires of his party’s progressives?</td>
      <td>Joe Biden begins his Presidency at a moment of deep political division, but paradoxically this gives him a rare opportunity. No doubt his Inaugural Address will echo his campaign theme of unity and healing, but his success in that mission will depend on resisting the divisive progressive domination sought by his party’s left.<br />Mr. Biden has been around long enough to appreciate the good fortune that has brought him to the Oval Office. Covid-19 accentuated Donald Trump’s leadership flaws and ruined the strong pre-pandemic economy. Mr. Biden was going nowhere in the Democratic primaries until Bernie Sanders emerged as the front-runner and the party turned to the former Vice President in political desperation.<br />Now as he takes office, the vaccines are rolling out and the economy is ready to soar once the Covid scourge eases. He will get political credit for the rebound simply by being there as the pandemic pall lifts. Unlike a Republican, Mr. Biden will also have nearly all of the media and the commanding heights of American culture behind him. A majority of Americans want an end to the furious rancor of recent years, and Mr. Biden is poised to benefit.<br />Left to his own political instincts, Mr. Biden could be the man for this moment. He is a moderate liberal with sympathy for the working class who is inclined to reach across the political aisle. With a 50-50 Senate and a narrow House majority, he also has good practical reason to do so. At 78 years old, he realizes he is likely to serve only one term and could create an admirable legacy as the man who calmed the Trump-era furies. That, at least, is our hopeful case for the Biden years.<br />Yet Mr. Biden also comes to power with a Democratic Party whose ascendant progressives have other ideas. Their goal is to use the federal government as a battering ram to drive economic and cultural “transformation.” Progressives in the House and Senate, urged on by the Democratic media complex and Silicon Valley, view the defeat of Donald Trump as the opening to assert a new level of government control over the economy and cultural dominance over American society.</td>

      <td>Clinton and Pelosi can’t let go of their enemy.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump’s Presidency ends on Wednesday at noon, as the Constitution stipulates. One question to ponder is who will miss him more—his friends or his foes?<br />Our guess is the latter. And if you doubt it, consider the chat between Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton Monday on Mrs. Clinton’s “You and Me Both” podcast. They’re addicted to the man.<br />“I would love to see [Mr. Trump’s] phone records to see whether he was talking to Putin the day that the insurgents invaded our Capitol,” Mrs. Clinton said. The former first lady, who has never accepted the results of the 2016 election, is immune to the irony that in claiming he really won the election President Trump is following her pre-election advice to Joe Biden to “not concede under any circumstance.”<br />Mrs. Pelosi said during the podcast that she once told Mr. Trump that “with you, Mr. President, all roads lead to Putin.” She added that the Capitol rioters “were doing Putin’s business when they did that at the incitement of an insurrection by the President of the United States.” When Mrs. Clinton asked whether the country needs “a 9/11-type commission to investigate and report everything that they can pull together,” Mrs. Pelosi responded “I do.” Though she says she doesn’t know what it is, she suggested Mr. Putin must have something on him “politically, financially or personally.”<br />Maybe they should have a special counsel spend years investigating Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. Wait, they already did that.</td>

      <td>Biden’s Treasury nominee adapts and extends her views.</td>
      <td>We have our policy disagreements with Janet Yellen, but there’s no denying she is a fine economist. So it was startling to hear her speak like a fact-hedging politician on Tuesday during her Senate confirmation hearing to be Joe Biden’s Treasury secretary. To wit, she did some on-the-fly editing of the economic literature to justify an increase in the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.<br />“Very minimal,” Ms. Yellen said in reply to a question by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott about the employment impact of Mr. Biden’s proposal to raise the federal minimum to $15 from $7.25. As evidence, she cited studies comparing employment in states that raised their minimum wage with neighboring ones that didn’t.<br />But those studies have yielded conflicting findings, and the economic literature overwhelmingly shows that raising the minimum wage reduces employment among teens and unskilled or inexperienced workers. Ms. Yellen acknowledged as much during a Congressional hearing in 2014 when she was asked about Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10.<br />“I think almost all economists think that the minimum wage has two main effects,” she replied. One is increasing pay for some low-paid workers, and the second is “there would be some amount of negative impact on employment.” How much is a matter of “considerable debate,” she said, adding that she “wouldn’t argue” with the Congressional Budget Office estimate that Mr. Obama’s hike would cost 500,000 jobs.<br />That impact won’t be “very minimal” if you’re among those who might have had one of those 500,000 lost jobs. And that number is likely to increase substantially if the minimum wage more than doubles to $15.</td>

Things were terrible; there was wreckage all around, and yet a sense of optimism must have been pervasive.<br />One part of our long national nightmare ends Wednesday as Donald Trump slinks off to Mar-a-Lago in disgrace, and Joe Biden takes over as president. Yet Mr. Trump leaves behind a second national nightmare: a raging pandemic and, largely for that reason, a sputtering economy.<br />When it comes to handling the pandemic, Mr. Trump has set the bar very low. Doing a better job than his predecessor will be a piece of cake for Mr. Biden. But “better” is not nearly good enough when record numbers of Americans are falling ill and dying. Mr. Biden must do vastly better. His comprehensive plans suggest that he will.<br />Public health is not my bailiwick, so I’ll concentrate on the economics. The national economy today is in passable shape given the unfolding health catastrophe, and the Cares Act of March 2020 is one major reason why. The law showed that Congress had learned two crucial lessons about fighting crises: Go fast, and go big. The Cares Act did both—and as a result it wasn’t as meticulously designed as it could have been.<br />There’s a third lesson: Don’t withdraw emergency support too soon. Mr. Biden clearly understands all three.</td>

      <td>Facebook and Twitter once positioned themselves as champions of an open internet. No longer.</td>
      <td>Social-media giants are under attack for censorship, but a few years ago they positioned themselves as champions of free speech. At issue was “net neutrality,” the Obama-era policy that treated internet service providers like  Comcast  and  AT&T  as common carriers—akin to the old Ma Bell monopoly—by prohibiting them from discriminating among content providers, including the social-media sites.<br />“Net neutrality is the idea that the internet should be free and open for everyone,”  Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerbergdeclared in July 2017 after the Federal Communications Commission’s then-chairman, Ajit Pai, moved to repeal the regulation, which the FCC had adopted two years earlier.  Twitter ’s  public-policy manager, Laura Culbertson, wrote: “Free expression is part of our company DNA. We are the platform that lets users see what’s happening and to see all sides. . . . Without Net Neutrality in force, ISPs would even be able to block content they don’t like, reject apps and content that compete with their own offerings, and arbitrarily discriminate against particular content providers by prioritizing certain Internet traffic over theirs.”<br />Facebook and Twitter turned out to be more threatening than under threat. Broadband providers haven’t attempted to block content or competitors since the FCC repealed net neutrality. But social media, app stores and cloud providers, which were never subject to the rules, all have engaged in censorship repeatedly in recent weeks.<br />Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat moved in lockstep to shut down Donald Trump’s accounts. Google and  Apple  banned the social-media app Parler, which promotes itself as a free-speech alternative to Twitter.  Amazon  Web Services booted Parler from its cloud, banishing it from the web until it could arrange service from another provider.<br />Appeals by big tech companies to protect an “open and free Internet” were always dubious. They had an interest in supporting net neutrality because it put them at an advantage. Among other things, the rule prohibited broadband providers from charging bandwidth guzzlers like Google’s YouTube, Amazon and Facebook more to upload their content at faster speeds.</td>

Fear is the theme of this year’s inauguration week.<br />The Journal’s Alison Sider and Andrew Restuccia report:<br />For most people, air travel restrictions are not the most difficult of the government-imposed limits on liberty imposed in the time of Covid. Certainly they harm fewer people than school closures. And flight restrictions can be helpful, especially if the virus isn’t already spreading widely at the flight’s destination. But at this point what exactly are the U.S. public health gains from banning inbound air travel by people who have recently tested negative? Remember, continuing to block visitors makes it harder to persuade other countries to admit travelers from the U.S.<br />Those of us who hoped that at some point a reasonable consideration of costs and benefits might somehow find its way into political deliberations on the virus have of course been disappointed.<br />For the most costly of the Covid rules, the search continues for a way to confirm the benefits.

      <td>For President Washington, holding public ofﬁce was a responsibility assumed, not an opportunity exploited.</td>
      <td>It ranks with the filibuster and the chaplain’s prayer among the hoariest traditions of the United States Senate: Every year since 1896, on or about Feb. 22, a member reads into the record George Washington’s Farewell Address. Washington’s prose, as honed by his ghostwriters James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, does not easily translate into the parlance of soundbite politics. But the dangers identified by the retiring president—excessive partisanship, sectional over national loyalties, misplaced allegiance to foreign powers—are as contemporary as the latest tweetstorm.<br />According to Stephen Howard Browne, a professor of communications at Penn State, the lawmakers may be listening to the wrong speech. To Mr. Browne it is Washington’s first inaugural address, delivered on April 30, 1789, that offers a classic defense of republican virtue as the linchpin of popular government. “I walk on untrodden ground,” the new president there acknowledged, his every action defining the scope of executive authority for all who would follow. In the years since, countless writers have retraced his footsteps, leading Mr. Browne himself to wonder: “Have we not had quite enough of George Washington?”<br />The question answers itself in this deceptively slender volume, in which Mr. Browne skillfully synthesizes biography, travelogue, social and political history, and rhetorical analysis to reach fresh conclusions about the relationship between individual and national character. Long before he took the oath of office on the balcony of New York’s Federal Hall, Washington had enshrined duty over self-advancement in his personal code. He demonstrated as much at the close of the Revolution, when mutinous officers in the Continental Army contemplated marching on Congress, until they were shamed out of it by their victorious general.<br />“That Americans have been spared the trauma of the military coup d’état,” writes Mr. Browne, “is owing in no small measure to a general insistent on the privilege of civil authority, who, wielding the sword in battle, laid it down in peace and left it there.” Can there be any stronger proof on this Inauguration Day of Washington’s continuing relevance? For him, no less than for his 20th-century admirer Dwight Eisenhower, the presidency was no promotion. On the eve of his investiture, fearing the toll of public controversy on his reputation, Washington confessed to emotions “as painful . . . as they are pleasing.” That he should nurse such feelings while being rowed across New York Harbor to the deafening cheers of his countrymen says much about this 18th-century idealist without illusions.<br />Hero worship exacted a high price, as Mr. Browne illustrates in tracking Washington’s triumphal two-week “inaugural journey” from Mount Vernon, Va., to New York City. Since visits from local notables would inconvenience private homeowners, the traveler opted to stay in “public houses” everywhere along his route. In Philadelphia, a massive parade ushered him down Market Street to City Tavern and yet another celebratory dinner, culminating in a toast (his 14th of the evening) to “government without oppression, and liberty without licentiousness.” The author enlivens Washington’s road trip with revealing detours into the president-elect’s spiritual outlook (he reserved his most fervent belief for religious tolerance and faith itself as a bulwark of public order); his attitude toward “the people”; and the seeds of American exceptionalism.</td>

      <td>Long-running battle involves concerns about racial and gender diversity</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday stepped into the middle of a long-running battle over federal limits on media ownership in local markets, weighing whether a recent regulatory rollback sufficiently addressed concerns about racial and gender diversity.<br />At issue was the Federal Communications Commission’s 2017 decision to loosen ownership restrictions by making it easier for one entity to own multiple TV stations in the same market. The rollback also repealed bans on common ownership of both a TV station and a newspaper in the same market, or a TV station and a radio station.<br />Some ownership limits had been in place for decades, to prevent concentration and preserve viewpoint diversity in local markets.<br />A federal appeals court in 2019 found the FCC didn’t satisfy its legal obligation to determine whether the rollback was in the public interest—because it didn’t adequately assess whether the changes would harm ownership of broadcast media by women and minorities. The FCC and a group of media companies, including  News Corp ,  owner of The Wall Street Journal, appealed to the high court.<br />During an hour-long oral argument, justices pressed both sides in the dispute, but several appeared sympathetic to claims by the FCC and the media companies that the old limits were outdated and didn’t take into account a changing media landscape.</td>

      <td>The left will try to convince Biden he has a mandate for progressive change. He doesn’t.</td>
      <td>When Barack Obama and Joe Biden entered the White House 12 years ago, the economy was in recession, unemployment was pushing 8%, and their fellow Democrats controlled the House and Senate. Sound familiar?<br />We know what happened next. Instead of focusing on economic growth, the Obama administration advanced an expensive but ineffective stimulus package and then went all in on a partisan transformation of the U.S. health-care system. The upshot was the slowest economic recovery since World War II. Democrats lost their House majority in 2010, and Republicans won the Senate four years later.<br />We’re about to find out what, if anything, Mr. Biden and his more liberal allies took away from that experience. Mr. Biden has said that his first order of business as president will be addressing Covid-19 and the economy. What we don’t know is whether the political left intends to let him do that. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party is much stronger than it was in 2009, and its members of Congress are far more numerous. Back then, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren did not command the national attention that they do today, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t old enough to buy beer.<br />On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden tried to put some rhetorical distance between himself and more radical proposals like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. It’s a strategy that obviously served him well in the election, but how well will it work for him in the White House?<br />When George W. Bush left office, his job-approval rating was in the mid-30s, and the incoming Obama administration interpreted Mr. Bush’s unpopularity as a mandate for its progressive agenda. That miscalculation cost Democrats control of Congress, and Republicans today are anticipating more such overreach under President Biden. Donald Trump didn’t lose re-election because he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement or prioritized securing the southern border or banned travel to the U.S. from countries with a history of coddling terrorists. Liberals who insist otherwise aren’t only kidding themselves but risk repeating the mistakes of a decade ago.</td>

      <td>Republican objection to fast-tracking Biden’s nominee suggests he won’t be confirmed on first day of administration</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Alejandro Mayorkas, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for Homeland Security secretary, told a Senate hearing Tuesday he would work to ensure that an attack like the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol wouldn’t be repeated, though his confirmation by Inauguration Day appeared to be delayed.<br />Mr. Biden’s team had named Mr. Mayorkas as one of a handful of national-security nominees it wanted confirmed on Inauguration Day because of continuing domestic threats. In 2017, the Senate confirmed both President Trump’s homeland security and defense nominees on Inauguration Day. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who is set to become the chamber’s majority leader on Wednesday, said on the Senate floor he hoped Mr. Mayorkas would be confirmed on Inauguration Day.<br />That timeline appeared less likely Tuesday after Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) said he would object to an attempt to fast-track the nomination. Mr. Hawley expressed concern about the incoming Biden administration’s plan to undo much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda, along with an expected push to create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million immigrants without a permanent legal status.<br />Mr. Hawley, who was the first senator to announce he would formally object to certifying the election results on Jan. 6, has faced a backlash from colleagues and donors since that day. Many Senate Republicans blame him for what they see as his role in instigating the riot that resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer.<br />Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Mr. Schumer met Tuesday to iron out details of a power-sharing agreement in a Senate divided evenly along party lines.  Under a similar agreement in 2001, nominees and bills could advance to the floor even if a committee vote tied.</td>

      <td>Chuck Norris’s whompin’ stompin lawman is turned into a soft-spoken hero encumbered by uncertainties.</td>
      <td>If you’re looking for whompin’, stompin’, kung-fu-administered rear-end alignments of the Chuck Norris variety, “Walker” may come as a surprise. It will be an understandable surprise: The show is a reboot, pun intended, of the old Norris vehicle “Walker, Texas Ranger,” in which acting, dramaturgy and plausibility took a back seat to the martial-arts prowess of Mr. Norris, the instant gratification that comes with bad guys being righteously thumped and the moral justification of violence, judiciously applied.<br />In “Walker,” Jared Padalecki (“Supernatural”) plays a far more nuanced edition of Cordell Walker, Texas ranger—lawman, father and widower, though not necessarily in that order; Walker’s priorities are poised to be a central part of the series’ plotlines and motivations. Where Mr. Norris was largely impenetrable, Mr. Padalecki is a wide-open book, riven with uncertainties, apt to make the wrong move. His Walker is established as something quite unusual: a law-and-order hero with no sense of authority.<br />This may well change, as only the pilot was available to review and, as with most new shows, the introductory episode is hampered by the task of having to introduce everything. That said, the show’s creator, Anna Fricke, might have done this more tidily. The opening moments of the first episode involve the death of Walker’s wife, Emily (Genevieve Padalecki), under circumstances that go unexplained, as do the man’s anguished cries when he hears gunshots over her cellphone while appearing otherwise paralyzed into inaction. The next thing we know, we’ve leapt ahead, to an evening in which Walker is late for his own welcome-home party, an event that provides some shorthand on the rest of the cast and their interrelationships, but not on where Walker’s been, why or for how long. He mutters something about “more than a month,” someone else later says “three months” but it’s hard to tell: All this soft-spoken Texas muttering may be regionally authentic, but it doesn’t help with the details.<br />Everyone’s mad at Walker, at any rate, especially his kids, Stella (Violet Brinson) and Augie (Kale Culley), since he seems to have disappeared right after their mother died. Not only has Mr. Padalecki’s character thus been cast as less than forthright and take-charge, it is suggested that he ran away at precisely the time his kids needed him. Rather than rush home to see them when he gets back from his mysterious mission, he parks his enormous pickup truck in a public park. Where he starts drinking. Only to be taken into custody by State Trooper Micki Ramirez (Lindsey Morgan), who, just coincidentally, is about the become a Texas Ranger and—gasp—Walker’s partner.<br />The moral grayness of “Walker” will give the show’s writers no end of material, especially since the series seems positioned to be family friendly, moralistic, vaguely Christian and averse to the kind of mayhem that distinguished the program’s predecessor: Walker does beat down one deserving, smart-mouthed drug smuggler, but then gets chastised by everyone including his supervisor (Coby Bell) and has to promise to be better. You have to ask yourself, what would Chuck Norris do?</td>

      <td>John Lurie’s new show is an odd collage of nature watching, storytelling and art instruction.</td>
      <td>Thirty years ago, John Lurie, the musician, composer, actor and personification of “downtown” New York—when “downtown” meant something culturally specific—had a television series called “Fishing With John.” It masqueraded, with little discernible effort, as a nature-sports program, but was really about Mr. Lurie and his “guests,” who were his friends and collaborators: Jim Jarmusch, Tom Waits, Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Dennis Hopper. The show lasted six episodes, but attained a cult following and is available in a Criterion Collection edition and on Criterion Channel.<br />Mr. Lurie’s new show, “Painting With John,” is a very different kind of show—part one-man chat show, part art class—albeit with a similar attitude toward TV genres. Talking into a camera like it’s a real person?, he asks. It’s so artificial. It’s so wrong. “People who can actually do it well?” he says in episode 3. “They’re probably sociopaths.” In fact, he says that the more shows he has done in the series, the better he’s gotten at it, and “the worse and worse person I’ve become.”<br />Clearly, the six-episode season is not out to seduce it’s audience with warmth and fuzziness, but the pacing, the insouciance, the music (Mr. Lurie’s) and the surprising vividness of the colors and the artwork make for a show that engages a viewer sincerely, even while being a semi-spoof: The first episode is called “Bob Ross Was Wrong” (meaning “Everyone can’t paint”). And though Mr. Lurie says he intended the show to be “educational,” he’s an intuitive painter and how can you teach intuition?<br />It’s the kind of question that leads him to tell stories—about his parents for instance, and how they never stifled the creative impulses of him or his brother and fellow musician Evan, who as a young child would assume a character such as Rin-Tin-Tin and “demand to have his dinner served to him on the floor in a bowl.” They never scolded him, but rather played along. (“Rin-Tin-Tin! It’s time for dinner!”) In ways both roundabout and very direct, Mr. Lurie is turning a show whose sensibility is casual into something instructive, without pedantry, or technical expertise: Each episode begins with Mr. Lurie crashing his drone (or seven, at one point) in an attempt to provide an introductory overview of the undisclosed Caribbean island he calls home. At one point he asks why’s he’s doing the show at all. “In fact, if you’re watching, turn it off.” I couldn’t oblige.<br />The show has three essential elements: island scenery; Mr. Lurie’s stories; and his various works in progress—paintings that combine mosaic-like fragments made of oil or watercolor and suggest Gustav Klimt with the delicate flora of a Japanese Edo-period landscape. The act of painting is absorbing in its delicacy; the programs in their entirety are haiku-like—short, seemingly spontaneous, but in fact precisely constructed. (It is a one-man show save for occasional appearances by Nesrin Wolf and Ann Mary Gludd Jones, who work for Mr. Lurie and perhaps live with him.)</td>

The financing brings Cruise’s valuation to $30 billion, Cruise said Tuesday, up from an estimated $19 billion in spring 2019.<br />GM is adding to its Cruise investment as part of the funding round and will retain a majority stake, a Cruise spokesman said.

Cruise for years has been testing driverless cars in San Francisco and plans an eventual robot-taxi service. It is also is exploring commercial delivery.<br />Driverless cars are expected to throw off troves of data for autonomous-service operators to capture, store and eventually monetize, analysts say.

      <td>New directive, aimed at a 2020 Supreme Court ruling, comes in the waning moments of the Trump administration</td>
      <td>The Justice Department has issued a memo that aims to limit the impact of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that protects gay and transgender people in the workplace, a last-minute attempt by the Trump administration to influence policy as President-elect Joe Biden begins assembling new leadership at the agency.<br />The Supreme Court’s June ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County said a bedrock federal civil-rights law prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The 6-3 opinion, written by a Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch, rejected the administration’s arguments that federal civil rights law provides no protection to LGBT employees.<br />The new memo, dated Sunday and sent by the acting head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, acknowledges the court’s ruling was sweeping, but says the department should not extend it further to areas such as housing and education, where longstanding gender-based policies on bathrooms and sports teams could come into play. The 23-page memo, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, also suggests that some employers could cite religious beliefs that would allow them to discriminate against LGBT employees.<br />“Unlike racial discrimination, the Supreme Court has never held that a religious employer’s decision not to hire homosexual or transgender persons ‘violates deeply and widely accepted views of elementary justice’ or that the government has a ‘compelling’ interest in the eradication of such conduct,” the memo says.<br />A DOJ spokeswoman didn’t have an immediately comment on the memo.</td>

      <td>ROME—Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte survived a confidence vote in the country’s Senate but fell short of an outright majority, weakening his government as it searches for a way to tame the Covid-19 pandemic and revive the economy.<br />The vote in the Senate was triggered by the decision of a small centrist party led by a former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to withdraw from the governing coalition. Mr. Renzi said he objected to Mr. Conte’s plans for spending more than 200 billion euros, equivalent to $243 billion, in European Union loans and grants to support the economic recovery after the pandemic.<br />Mr. Conte garnered 156 votes in favor of his left-leaning government and 140 against, with Mr. Renzi’s party abstaining. After falling short of an absolute majority in Italy’s 321-member Senate, Mr. Conte could struggle in the future when he seeks to pass legislation. The government previously relied on Mr. Renzi’s group for its Senate majority.<br />“We will have a weak government precisely when we would need a very strong one,” said Valentina Meliciani, an economics professor at LUISS University in Rome.<br />The government won a confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament on Monday, where it has a stronger majority. If Mr. Conte had lost the Senate vote he would have been forced to resign, paving the way to either a new governing coalition or a snap election, which opinion polls suggest the right-of-center opposition parties would win.</td>

They were provoked by the president and other powerful people and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday.<br />Mr. McConnell has said he is considering whether he would vote to convict Mr. Trump during his second impeachment trial, which will take place after Mr. Trump leaves office. The House passed an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump last week, focused on his statements encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol.<br />How Mr. McConnell votes will be central to whether enough Republicans join Democrats in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump. A two-thirds supermajority is needed to convict in presidential impeachment trials, meaning 17 Republicans would need to support conviction for it to succeed.<br />Some Republicans, though, have said they don’t believe that holding an impeachment trial for someone who no longer holds office is constitutional. Democrats will soon control a majority in the Senate.</td>

But Mr. Biden has already passed on an even greater opportunity. When  Facebook ,  YouTube,  Twitter  and Apple shut down competing social media; as banks declined to do business with President Trump; as pundits called for ostracizing all Trump administration officials from future employment; as CEOs at major American corporations rushed to decline commerce with people who dared voice their worry about the fairness of the presidential election, Mr. Biden could have taken the stage and shouted that enough was enough. He could have pounded the podium and told social-media companies to “stand down” and open their channels to all Americans again; scolded businesses that it isn’t “American” to close your markets to people with differing political opinions; declared that we don’t deny people who serve this country future employment because we see the world through a different political prism and demanded an end to self-aggrandizing attacks on the millions of our fellow citizens who voted for President Trump.<br />How could the social-media moguls and the Amazons, Citibanks and Targets of the world refuse such a request for unity? It would have been, and still might be, as historic a gesture as Abraham Lincoln’s call for unity as the Civil War drew to a close. But our newly elected president has done none of these things.

This is the more significant reason for a result at odds with the popular vote.<br />The Electoral College “causes candidates to campaign heavily in ‘battleground states’ while ignoring those they think they are certain to carry or not.” Battleground states are entirely the result of “winner take all.” Take California—the most populous state and one that is overwhelmingly Democratic. Under “winner take all” it is a miracle that any presidential candidate, Republican or Democratic, campaigns there. If, on the other hand, electoral votes were allocated proportional to the statewide vote, essentially as in Maine and Nebraska, both candidates would spend a lot of time in California. Under a proportional allocation even the loser in California could garner a substantial number of electoral votes.<br />“Winner take all” is not part of the Electoral College nor is it to be found anywhere else in the Constitution.

Mr. Biden has called for eliminating carbon-dioxide emissions from the power sector by 2035, and Tuesday’s ruling would allow him to push toward doing so without first trying to repeal or overhaul a set of rules put in place by conservatives.<br />Power plant emissions have long been one of the top two U.S. sources of greenhouse-gas emissions, putting them in the crosshairs of attempts by government to address global warming. The rules vacated Tuesday were an attempt by the Trump administration to overhaul the first-ever U.S. rules on these emissions, the Clean Power Plan, put in place by the Obama administration.</td>

      <td>Things may improve for banks, but without loan demand, revenue growth will still be hard to come by</td>
      <td>Heading into 2021, it appears that things aren’t getting any worse for bank stocks. But it may be some time before they get much better.<br />Bank of America  executives on Tuesday suggested that the bank’s net interest income likely bottomed in the third quarter, rising about 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, and that the fourth quarter of 2021 will likely look much better than the first.  JPMorgan Chase  last week reported 2% quarter-over-quarter growth in net interest income, and expects a pickup in 2021 versus 2020. The two banks had reported 2020 declines of 11% and 5% in net interest income, respectively.<br />One reason for optimism, widely cited across banks, is how much cash banks can still shift into their securities portfolios. Even absent any pickup in loan demand, banks can continue to put cash generated by deposits into fixed-income securities that pick up more yield.<br />Still, the road to much improved interest income across banks isn’t straightforward. One challenge is that mortgages continue to be prepaid because of a surge in refinancing, which affects mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America cited this as having a significant impact on its net interest yield. Banks have so much cash to deploy that they can still make gains in yields net of this effect. But where mortgage rates go could be a huge swing factor.<br />There is certainly hope in the shape of the yield curve. Banks across the board noted the recent steepening of the curve, as long-term rates have risen, as a big benefit. For example, the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasuries is as wide as it has been since 2017. However, banks have reasons to be cautious about simply buying longer-term fixed-income securities, as this could cause them to miss out on future rate increases.</td>

Chuck Schumer, will meet Tuesday to iron out the details of a power-sharing agreement in a Senate divided evenly along party lines.<br />Georgia on Tuesday formally certified Democratic victories for its two recent Senate races, ensuring that Democrats will take control of the chamber for the first time since 2015. Democrats will formally gain the Senate majority once the three new senators from California and Georgia are sworn in on Wednesday afternoon, because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris wields a tiebreaking vote. The chamber already is moving ahead with the confirmation process for some of President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet nominees and is expected to hold an impeachment trial of President Trump, though its timing hasn’t been determined.<br />In the past, a 50-50 Senate has meant that while each party gets an equal number of committee seats, the majority party holds committee chairmanships and controls the agenda, setting the schedule for nominees and legislation to come to the floor for votes. When the Senate last had a power-sharing arrangement, in 2001, that meant that nominees and bills could advance to the floor even if a committee vote was tied. The arrangements this time around are still being negotiated, however, and it isn’t known what rules will be in place.<br />In addition to hashing out a power-sharing agreement, Messrs. McConnell (R., Ky.) and Schumer (D., N.Y.) will discuss a Covid-19 relief package and nominees, a person familiar with the matter said. Both Republicans and Democrats are looking to the 2001 arrangement as a model, this person said.<br />In remarks on the Senate floor at noon Tuesday, Mr. McConnell argued that November’s elections didn’t hand any side a mandate for broad ideological change.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The London Metal Exchange is proposing closing its open-outcry ring, where traders have swapped metals like copper and lead using shouts and hand signals for 144 years, in a bid to attract more financial players to its marketplace.<br />The LME temporarily closed the ring when Covid-19 ripped through the U.K. in March, judging the tight circle of red couches that dozens of traders crowd around to be a health risk. The exchange, owned by  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. , is now floating the idea of shutting the ring for good.<br />The ring began life when the LME was founded above a London hat shop in 1877, though its origins date to sawdust circles around which merchants bought and sold metals in the early 1800s, when they were in high demand as the industrial revolution gathered steam. It survived two world wars, the decline of the U.K. as the world’s leading industrial economy and the rise of China as the largest metals consumer.<br />However, the coronavirus pandemic may prove to be its undoing. Launching a consultation on the proposed closure Tuesday, the LME said electronic pricing had served the market well during the pandemic and would bring greater transparency around the way that prices are set.<br />The ring’s long-term survival in the face of electronic trading has long been debated. The LME had previously experimented with setting closing prices electronically on a small scale in the nickel market. Covid-19 prompted the exchange to run that trial across the gamut of metals and contract dates.</td>

The charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Typically, first-time offenders receive well below the maximum penalty.<br />The government alleges that Mr. Afrasiabi has been receiving a salary—totaling at least $265,000—from the Iranian mission to the United Nations since at least 2007, and health-care benefits since at least 2011. During that time, the complaint says, he helped Iran shape its public messaging in the media and advocated Iranian government positions at the highest levels of U.S. government.<br />Mr. Afrasiabi made contact with numerous U.S. government officials without disclosing his ties to the Iranian government, according to the government, including an unnamed member of Congress and his staff as well as a senior official in the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.<br />Such consulting activity usually requires a public registration with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law designed to bring transparency to the advocacy work of foreign states. In recent years, the Justice Department has reinvigorated its enforcement of the foreign-agents law, charging a number of lobbyists, consultants, business figures and academics for failing to disclose their ties to foreign states or foreign income.</td>

      <td>Armin Laschet and his party hope to keep the boring times rolling.</td>
      <td>Germany took another step Saturday in its long transition to whatever will come after Angela Merkel, as the country’s largest party elected Armin Laschet as leader. As head of Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, Mr. Laschet is in pole position to succeed her as chancellor after October elections—for boring or worse.<br />This marks the CDU’s second attempt to find a political heir for Mrs. Merkel, after Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s ascent to the party leadership in late 2018. AKK, as she’s known, was Mrs. Merkel’s preferred successor but proved inept at managing tensions among factions within the CDU. A string of poor state election results for the CDU hastened her exit last year amid a ruckus over cooperation between some local CDU candidates and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).<br />With Mr. Laschet, the CDU is attempting the same policy strategy embodied by AKK. He represents continuity with Mrs. Merkel in almost all respects, from his timidity on domestic economic reforms to his sympathy for Russia and enthusiasm for closer economic ties with China. The party on Saturday again rebuffed Friedrich Merz, who ran against Mr. Laschet and against AKK in 2018 on a free-market reform platform. CDU convention delegates also knocked out foreign-policy hawk Norbert Röttgen.<br />It’s a bet that when they elect a new parliament this year, Germans will want more of Mrs. Merkel’s brand of wooly centrism. But if that turns out to be true, it will be by default. State election results and opinion polls suggest the CDU and its Bavarian sister the CSU remain Germany’s plurality party but with markedly diminishing support.<br />Meanwhile, German politics is drifting away from Mrs. Merkel’s breed of consensus. Despite winning a leadership election among delegates to the CDU party conference, Mr. Laschet’s soft foreign-policy views are increasingly at odds with prominent CDU figures who advocate a sterner approach to Russia and China. The Greens are on the rise as a mainstream center-left party on the back of their foreign-policy hawkishness and hostility to crony capitalism at home.</td>

      <td>Ready to challenge yourself to feel healthier and stronger?<br />The Wall Street Journal is launching its first fitness challenge, a six-week program of step-up exercises designed for people of all ages and fitness levels who want to dial their workout up a notch. Developed by veteran NBA sports performance coach Arnie Kander, this six-week program doesn’t require equipment and can be performed anywhere, even in small spaces.<br />CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE CHALLENGE.<br />Mr. Kander spent 25-plus years working with NBA teams, including the Minnesota Timberwolves and Detroit Pistons, for whom he still serves as a consultant. The 20-second step-up became his gold standard for measuring an athlete’s baseline level of fitness. “I’ve probably used it 1,000 times on professional athletes,” he says. It’s a very simple test that tells a lot about a person’s movement efficiency, balance response, coordination, reflexes, ankle flexibility and core strength.<br />Last spring, he challenged friends. A 94-year-old woman he knows completed eight steps up and down in 20 seconds. A former professional soccer player achieved 41 steps, up and down in 20 seconds. That’s nearly two steps per second.</td>

      <td>Abolishing the tipped minimum wage would wipe out the benefit of his Covid grants.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden proposes $15 billion in relief grants for America’s Covid-crushed businesses. But he also wants to mandate a new minimum wage that for many restaurants would wipe out the benefit and then some.<br />Restaurants shed some six million jobs in the first two months of the pandemic. As a consequence of continued Covid-related closures and a decline in customer traffic, the industry ended 2020 with 2.5 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic. They received a temporary lifeline through the Paycheck Protection Program, but have advocated without success for more-substantial relief. Mr. Biden’s recovery plan acknowledges restaurants were “disproportionately” harmed by Covid.<br />But he also proposes to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, which more than doubles the existing minimum, $7.25 an hour. The separate minimum for tipped workers is $2.13 an hour, and the president-elect proposes to raise that to $15 too—an increase of more than 600%. Tipped workers are already required to earn the full federal minimum between their base wage and tips, and most earn far more.<br />The relief grants wouldn’t come close to offsetting this new mandate. Consider the math for a small full-service restaurant location in West Virginia with five servers, where the tipped-wage minimum is $2.62 an hour. Mr. Biden’s plan would raise the hourly cost of each server by $12.38, or $19,313 annually for a 30-hour workweek. With payroll taxes, that’s roughly $100,000 in new annual costs, compared with the average Covid relief grant of $15,000 per small business.<br />A recent study from economists at Miami and Trinity universities finds a plan like Mr. Biden’s would cost the hospitality industry more than one million jobs—including nearly 700,000 held by tipped workers. A Census Bureau study shows that restaurant workers see lower tips in states with a higher minimum wage, a likely consequence of restaurants’ transition towards self-service models. Unsurprisingly, tipped workers oppose Mr. Biden’s plan.</td>

Instead, the president is planning to leave the White House Wednesday morning for a send-off ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, according to people familiar with the matter.

The invitation instructs guests to wear masks. It also says invitees can bring as many as five guests.<br />More than 200 service members are expected to participate in Mr. Trump’s formal departure, which is expected to include a 21-gun salute, a color guard and other ceremonial units, U.S. officials said. Mr. Trump is likely to make remarks, officials said.</td>

      <td>To succeed, he’ll have to establish a chain of command and level with the public.</td>
      <td>Describing his plan to get the Covid-19 pandemic under control, Joe Biden was blunt. “You have my word,” the president-elect declared last week. “We will manage the hell out of this operation.” He had better. Anything less would be a body blow to his administration and the country.<br />When there is widespread agreement on a course of action, leaders are judged on how well they carry it out. In her 2016 book, “Why Presidents Fail,” my Brookings Institution colleague Elaine Kamarck shows how management failures can make or break presidencies. Jimmy Carter never recovered from the failed mission to rescue American hostages in Iran, nor did George W. Bush from his botched response to Hurricane Katrina. The implosion of the Affordable Care Act’s website significantly weakened the Obama presidency.<br />This is all the more important when policies affect individuals directly, because these policies inform how society perceives the competence of its institutions and leaders. Savvy politicians understand that attitudes toward government are shaped by motor-vehicle departments and Veterans Affairs hospitals. Members of Congress quickly learn that constituent services in their local offices matter at least as much as voting records. Helping constituents navigate complex bureaucracies affects not only them but the stories they tell their friends and neighbors.<br />You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and managing the pandemic will be the first impression President Biden makes. If he gets it right, he will strengthen his hand in dealing with a divided Congress, and he will begin the long task of rebuilding public trust and confidence in government. If his team botches the job, he will bear the brunt of public disappointment.<br />Mr. Biden has inherited a monumental challenge. The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed encouraged the development of vaccines in record time, but then hit a snag in logistics. The feds have shipped vaccines more slowly than expected. Many states have been inadequately prepared to pass out the vaccines they receive. Highly publicized instances of line-jumping threaten to weaken confidence in the fairness of the process.</td>

Global health laws requiring countries rapidly share all pertinent information on an emerging threat “lacked teeth,” one of the panelists said. Complex bureaucratic rules, created to prevent the WHO from taking hasty decisions that could hurt the global economy, meant that several weeks were lost before the agency could declare Covid-19 an international public health emergency, Ms. Clark said.<br />“Viruses move in minutes and hours, rather than days and weeks, especially in the highly mobile and interconnected world of today,” said Ms. Clark. “The international system for alert and response has the trappings of an analogue system in a digital age.”</td>

It wasn’t clear whether  Ford  participated in this round.<br />The new money will allow the company to focus on launching three products this year while scaling up for growth, said RJ Scaringe, Rivian’s founder and chief executive, in a statement.<br />The new funding round illustrates that the torrent of new investment into electric-vehicle companies shows no signs of slowing so far in 2021. Investors are betting smaller challengers can take on legacy auto makers, causing valuations for all electric-vehicle companies to balloon over the past year.</td>

      <td>FedEx Corp.  plans to cut up to 6,300 jobs in Europe as it completes the process of combining its Express network with the package-delivery operations of its TNT unit.<br />The delivery company said Tuesday that it will lay off between 5,500 and 6,300 workers in operational and back-office roles as it seeks to address the overlap resulting from operating two European networks connecting similar geographies.<br />The proposed cuts could affect up to 2.6% of FedEx Express’ roughly 245,000 employees, including about 43,000 at TNT, as of May 31, 2020. The job cuts will differ by country and could be in the form of reassignment to other roles and priority access to open positions.<br />FedEx said it expects severance-benefits costs of between $300 million and $575 million, before taxes, that are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2023. The company sees savings of $275 million to $350 million annually beginning fiscal 2024 as a result of the job reductions.<br />FedEx bought TNT, a Dutch company, in 2016. FedEx at that time had a sizable air-express delivery operation in Europe, but it lagged behind in the ground-delivery business. Acquiring TNT gave it an established door-to-door network in Europe, saving the U.S.-based company the time and money required to build one from scratch.</td>

      <td>Upstart luxury liquidators like Heat and Scarce are offloading surplus clothing from labels like Off-White and Saint Laurent with a twist: The customers have no idea what they’re actually buying</td>
      <td>LAST YEAR, as part of a wave of retail-store closures, discount retailers Century 21 and Stein Mart filed for bankruptcy. Coronavirus, which slowed Americans’ shopping to a crawl, certainly played a part in their fall—and left many of the brands, stores and factories that had relied on these once-beloved “close-out retailers” holding a surfeit of new clothes that no one was really buying.<br />An intriguing new solution for selling overstock, off-season clothing has emerged, however. Two upstart companies—Heat, founded in London in November 2019; and Scarce, launched in New York in December 2020—offer so-called “luxury mystery boxes” that contain clothing items pulled from the surplus stock of boutiques, brands like Moncler, Balenciaga and Off-White, and even factories. Collectively, the items originally retailed for two to three times as much, on average, as the box’s price. The twist: Until the customers open the box and peek inside, they have no idea what they’re getting. That said, boxes are sold by gender, and users can input in advance their pant, shoe and top sizes<br />Joe Wilkinson, one of the co-founders of Heat, explained that he and his partners came across this surprise packaging concept via YouTube. They noticed “a bit of a trend” for videos where YouTubers would film themselves opening “mystery boxes” that they’d acquired either from independent fashion resellers or other YouTubers. In a typical clip, a chatty, college-aged streetwear fan would tear open a box to reveal some rare Adidas, a piece of Yeezy or Supreme merch, or a hard-to-find Palm Angels hoodie. The videos were like an action flick for sneaker addicts and the “what will they pull out next?” suspense kept fans watching. Mr. Wilkinson and his peers decided to turn this gamified unboxing idea into a business, catering to millennial and Gen-Z fashion fans who would watch—or make—these mystery videos.<br />The idea clicked. The day Heat launched, said Mr. Wilkinson, it sold thousands of boxes using a tiered pricing scheme. For around $400 you can acquire a box containing items like T-shirts and small accessories, while roughly $675 gets you a box filled with higher-value hoodies and outerwear. When it comes to selecting their box, which can contain two to a handful of items depending on their price, shoppers can also choose between two broad style categories: “streetwear,” which encompasses brands like Rhude and Ambush, and “contemporary,” which leans on higher-fashion brands like Casablanca and Haider Ackermann.<br />Both Heat and Scarce allow for returns, but customers must return the entire box, not just a single item. If you receive three items, and you adore just one, you will be saddled with the two other so-so items as well. Further, both companies require returns within 14 days and expect customers to assume responsibility for any return shipping fees. Perhaps because of this restrictive, cumbersome process, both companies boast low return rates: Heat claims that 10 to 15% of its boxes are returned, while Scarce reports a 5% return rate.</td>

      <td>The eyes have had it. All that extra scrolling? It’s taking a toll.</td>
      <td>This past year has been, among a great many other things, hard on the eyes. While stress and sleeplessness are contributing to our perpetually tired peepers, another behavioral shift brought on by the pandemic has had a significant impact: a steady rise in screen time. Everything from work to workouts, schooling to socializing, is now being done via video chat. And then there’s the constant doomscrolling that’s an unfortunate new norm. We’re dependent on our screens more than ever, and that’s having an effect not only on our eyes, but on the skin around them as well.<br />It’s understandable, considering the skin around the eyes is easily bothered. “The eyelid skin is the thinnest and most delicate of the body and therefore is one of the first areas to show signs of aging, including fine lines, wrinkles and hyperpigmentation,” says Shari Marchbein, a New York City dermatologist and an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at NYU. Blood vessels are often more visible through thin skin, a problem that becomes more pronounced, says Marchbein, as we age and lose collagen and elastin. The area is also hypersensitive, adds Caroline Robinson, a dermatologist and the founder and CEO of Chicago’s Tone Dermatology. “Our under-eye and eyelid skin are more susceptible to dryness and can more easily become irritated,” she says.<br />The uptick in screen time means more squinting. “Squinting, where we engage the orbicularis oculi muscle, is a top reason that dermatologists see fine lines and wrinkles at the lateral sides of the eyelid known as crow’s-feet,” says Marchbein, who often treats this issue in office with careful placement of botulinum toxin, such as Botox or Dysport, to soften and prevent future deepening of the lines. Too much squinting is also one of a number of symptoms to clue people in that they might need a new pair of glasses or an update to their prescription, says ophthalmologist Rupa Wong. “Squinting, blurry vision, abnormal head posturing, headaches, needing to move screens either closer or farther away are some of the symptoms to look for,” Wong notes.<br />While blue light is emitted primarily by the sun, we’re also exposed to it via our coterie of devices. “Known as HEV [high-energy visible] light, it’s the light in the blue end of the visible spectrum, and it penetrates even deeper into the skin than UV light does,” says Joshua Zeichner, a dermatologist and an associate professor of dermatology at New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital. While there’s solid scientific evidence of the detrimental effect of blue light produced by the sun, researchers are still investigating the impact of device-borne blue light. In general, though, the damage caused by blue light can be significant. “There is mounting evidence that supports blue light’s contribution to photoaging, including wrinkles, skin laxity and hyperpigmentation or brown spots,” says Marchbein. Dermatologists also have good evidence, she adds, to show that blue light triggers skin conditions like melasma. “As blue light penetrates the skin, reactive oxygen species are generated, which leads to DNA damage, thereby causing inflammation and the breakdown of healthy collagen and elastin,” Marchbein explains. “The more time we spend on our devices, the worse off our skin might be.”<br />So, what to do? Eye creams, depending on the active ingredients, can offer some improvement. Aesthetician Georgia Louise recommends looking for products with peptides and mild vitamin A, or retinol, to help address fine lines and wrinkles. Marchbein has found that caffeine can offer modest results for dark circles by constricting blood vessels. For redness and discoloration, she suggests the anti-inflammatory niacinamide and skin-brightening licorice root. According to Marchbein, pronounced puffiness and dark circles often require more invasive, in-office procedures like hyaluronic acid fillers and sometimes surgery. Daily application of vitamin C is important for protecting skin from HEV light–related free-radical damage, says Zeichner. One crucial product in a screen-conscious skin-care regimen, even when you’re spending most of your time indoors, is sunblock. “I recommend a daily broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher, even when indoors,” says Robinson. The key is making sure that the sunblock is a mineral variety with iron oxide on the ingredient list. “The iron-based pigments of the sunscreen help reflect away HEV light to protect the skin,” Zeichner explains. “Unfortunately, traditional chemical sunscreen does not block HEV light at all.”</td>

Slovakia will allow commuting to work only with a negative coronavirus test. France has imposed a nationwide curfew of 6 p.m. Italians are barred from traveling outside their home region for at least another month.</td>

      <td>The New York Mets fired general manager Jared Porter on Tuesday morning just hours after publication of accusations that he sent explicit, unsolicited texts and images to a female journalist in 2016 when he worked for the Chicago Cubs.<br />The move, which comes just over a month after Porter’s hiring, was announced on Twitter by new team owner Steve Cohen and represents the first crisis of the billionaire hedge-fund manager’s stewardship of the Mets.<br />Major League Baseball also intends to launch an investigation into Porter, which could lead to him being suspended from the sport, a person familiar with the matter said. Former Houston Astros assistant GM Brandon Taubman was indefinitely banned from baseball last January after he made inappropriate comments toward female reporters at a postgame celebration during the 2019 playoffs.<br />ESPN reported that Porter, who was then working as the Cubs’ director of professional scouting, sent more than 60 unanswered messages to the woman, including one of a naked penis. The woman—who was not named and came from a foreign country to cover baseball—told ESPN she believed Porter’s initial interactions with her were of a typical journalist-source relationship, but that his tone quickly turned inappropriate.<br />In the ESPN story, which came out around 11 p.m. ET Monday night, Mets president Sandy Alderson said Porter acknowledged “his serious error in judgment” and that the organization would “review the facts.” Just before 8 a.m., Cohen tweeted that he had terminated the 41-year-old Porter, who finalized a four-year contract in mid-December.</td>

      <td>Economic rebound in year of Covid-19 was unbalanced; growth in domestic consumption lagged behind industrial and export sectors</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—One thing is missing from China’s otherwise remarkable economic recovery: a strong rebound in consumer spending.<br />Even though China was the only major economy to expand during the Covid-19 pandemic last year, its growth remains highly unbalanced, relying heavily on exports of manufactured goods to the U.S. and elsewhere. Domestic consumption has lagged, with retail sales shrinking 3.9% in 2020 from the previous year and demand for imported goods falling slightly.<br />There are many reasons for the weakness. While China’s unemployment rate never shot up as much as unemployment did in the U.S. and Europe, many employers cut salaries or hours, leaving consumers anxious. Many opted to save more—a common tendency in China, which has long had a high savings rate.<br />China’s government also didn’t hand out checks to consumers as the U.S. did, choosing instead to focus stimulus on helping factories and other businesses.<br />Many economists now believe spending weakness will persist in 2021. If it does, it could mean Chinese demand does less than hoped to help lift other economies out of trouble this year.</td>

A nationwide referendum in 2009 also saw Swiss voters support a proposal to ban the construction of minarets for mosques.<br />This time voters are being asked whether Switzerland should ban full-face coverings nationwide after a group including members of the right-wing Swiss People’s Party gathered more than 100,000 signatures, passing the threshold required for a popular vote on changing the constitution. The same group initiated the 2009 vote, describing minarets as foreign to Swiss cultural traditions, sparking a wider debate in Europe about the integration of Muslims at a time when there was growing concern over the influence of Islamist extremists.<br />The debate continues in many parts of Europe, notably France, where President Emmanuel Macron has proposed legislation to outlaw what he calls “Islamist separatism,” and which includes preventing the indoctrination of children during home schooling and online hate speech.<br />France previously prohibited wearing full-face veils in public as a way to support its secular values, as have other European countries.</td>

The conditions, stipulated in a statement on the agency’s website, also required that Cisco and Acacia continue supplying certain products without discrimination and unreasonable terms.<br />The announcement Tuesday removed a regulatory barrier that had nearly doomed the deal earlier this month. Acacia had moved to terminate the agreement, first announced in July 2019, claiming Cisco hadn’t received timely approval from Chinese authorities. Cisco disputed the claim but raised the purchase price by 64%, cementing a new deal.<br />The need for Chinese regulatory approval has loomed large over some major tech deals as waiting times have increased and U.S.-China relations have soured.<br />In 2018, a $44 billion deal between  Qualcomm Inc.  and Dutch chip maker NXP Semiconductors NV fell through after it failed to gain Chinese approval before the deal expired.

Royal Caribbean Finance Chief Jason Liberty said the deal wasn’t driven by financial reasons and that it had considered selling the brand before the health crisis.<br />The company will seek to expand its core Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea brands after the sale, according to Royal Caribbean, which also operates TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises under a joint venture. Under the transaction, expected to close in the first quarter, Sycamore will acquire Azamara’s three ships and intellectual property such as the brand’s logo and slogan, the company added.<br />Royal Caribbean in December said it sold two ships in its Royal Caribbean International fleet. The company will come out of the deal with three fewer ships than its 61-ship fleet in 2019 after taking two ship deliveries and exiting a joint venture for Pullmantur Cruceros, which filed for reorganization under Spanish insolvency laws in 2020, a spokesman said.<br />“It allows us to really prioritize our resources, which are not just financial resources—it’s also the minds and time of management,” Mr. Liberty told The Wall Street Journal.</td>

The new investor may own the mall but not the department stores or parcels in the parking lot, which means an owner needs their approval. Owners will also need to seek rezoning and entitlements permits that can take years, during which economic conditions can deteriorate.<br />Consequently, many recent conversion efforts have gone awry, forcing the owner to sell the property at a discount. In other cases, local government authorities have lost patience and bought the owners out.<br />Brookfield Property Partners  LP has made converting all or part of malls one of its prime real-estate strategies. In 2018, the firm bought the two-thirds of mall operator GGP Inc. it didn’t already own, valuing GGP’s property portfolio at around $15 billion. The acquisition reflected Brookfield’s confidence in the mall-conversion strategy, but the real-estate investor has often struggled to make this approach work.</td>

Because of that, the law requires Gen. Austin, who retired from the U.S. Army in 2016, to receive a waiver from Congress to hold the job of secretary of defense, in addition to winning the Senate confirmation required of most cabinet-level appointees.<br />“Lloyd is very cognizant that he is coming in as a political appointee,” said a person familiar with his preparations for the confirmation hearings. “He knows that he is going to be a civilian, politically appointed official in the Biden cabinet, and he’s comfortable taking on that new role. He has to make it clear he is not a general.”<br />Laws safeguarding civilian control of the military require the top Pentagon civilian job to be held by someone out of uniform for seven years, unless Congress votes to waive the rule. Gen. Austin, 67, would become the second recent Pentagon leader to require a congressional waiver, following retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, who was President Trump’s first defense secretary.</td>

Last year was likely much better:  Credit Suisse  estimates that China’s industrial-robotics market grew 9.5% in 2020.<br />Covid-19 initially shut down factories in China, but as the country gradually got the pandemic under control, demand for automation equipment bounced back.

But hopes are running high in China that the government will push more strongly for local content in the robotics and automation supply chain. Stocks of Chinese automation companies have rallied. Shares in  Shenzhen Inovance Technology ,  for example, have tripled since the beginning of 2020. Industrial robot maker  Estun Automation ’s  shares have also rallied.<br />Some Chinese automation-equipment companies won market share last year as Covid-19 disrupted supply chains for foreign rivals. Citi estimates Inovance’s China market share in servo motors, which are used to control precise movements, has jumped to more than 16% in 2020, against 11% in 2019 and 3% in 2013. The company also recorded strong growth in its electric-vehicle motor business, which shares some similarities with servo motors. The company’s net profit nearly doubled year-over-year in the first nine months of 2020.</td>

With that historic event as a backdrop, Mr. Biden will focus on his approach to the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the U.S. and attempt to calm a nation grappling with racial and political divisions, his aides have said.<br />The inauguration’s theme is “America United,” and Mr. Biden’s speech is being written with the help of speechwriter Vinay Reddy and Mr. Biden’s longtime aide Mike Donilon, who will serve as a senior White House adviser, according to people familiar with the plans.<br />Mr. Biden’s top aides haven’t released details about his remarks, which the people familiar with his plans said Mr. Biden has been drafting since the start of his presidential transition in November. But aides have said his speech will be in keeping with the major themes of his campaign, including unity, bipartisanship and optimism.<br />“He wants to use the moment to call Americans to unity,” said Jen Psaki, Mr. Biden’s incoming press secretary.</td>

      <td>Michigan has ordered Enbridge to close pipeline supplying Canada’s most populous region</td>
      <td>TORONTO—Canadian and U.S. officials are at odds over the fate of a pipeline underneath the Great Lakes, exacerbating disagreements over energy policy between the two nations as the Biden administration prepares to take office.<br />Citing environmental concerns, Michigan state officials have told  Enbridge Inc.  to close its Line 5 pipeline, which carries more than half a million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids each day from Superior, Wis. to Sarnia, Ontario. Canadian officials say closing the pipeline would choke off more than half of the supply used to make gasoline, jet fuel and home-heating oil for the most populous parts of the country. The 645-mile pipeline, which is part of Enbridge’s mainline system that conveys oil and natural gas liquids from Alberta, feeds refineries in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ontario and Quebec.<br />“Pipelines are so vital to the economy and the recovery,” said Chris Bloomer president of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, a trade group. “We’re hoping for some pragmatism.”<br />The dispute adds another point of conflict in the energy relationship between the U.S. and Canada. Officials, companies and environmentalists in both countries have clashed in recent years over how to balance energy security with environmental concerns.<br />President-elect Joe Bien’s team has said that he opposes a proposed extension of  TC Energy Corp.’s  Keystone pipeline, which would carry oil from Alberta to Nebraska. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has long advocated for the extension, has said it would be a key issue between the two countries during Mr. Biden’s tenure. Canadian officials said they expect Mr. Biden to stick with his plans to scrap the project.</td>

Staples said it would pursue a public tender offer for ODP’s shares in March if the companies don’t reach agreement on a deal.<br />ODP has concluded that a sale of its retail and consumer-facing e-commerce operations to Staples or a joint venture is preferable to a full takeover, according to a letter sent by ODP’s chairman to an official of the private-equity firm that controls Staples. It said in the letter, seen by The Wall Street Journal, that such a deal would afford the same cost savings as a full-company sale but be less likely to attract prolonged regulatory scrutiny.<br />Staples’ recent bid marks the third time it has tried to acquire its main bricks-and-mortar rival. Previous efforts, including a $6.3 billion proposal five years ago, were blocked by antitrust enforcers. Staples was taken private by Sycamore Partners in 2017 and is now controlled by a subsidiary of the buyout firm called USR Parent Inc.<br />In a sign that investors anticipate a deal of some sort, ODP shares have climbed 24% since USR disclosed its bid, closing at $45.86 Friday. A tie-up of the office-suppliers’ retail operations could generate significant cost-savings if the combined company reduces its footprint by closing overlapping stores.</td>

At the time, domestic and international investors had committed more than $34 billion to its IPOs, and their funds were subsequently returned.<br />Investors in the five mutual funds earlier agreed to lock up their money for 18 months. After Ant’s IPO was suspended, a public outcry ensued, and the asset managers agreed to let investors withdraw their money between Nov. 23 and Dec. 22 without incurring transaction fees.<br />Regulatory filings from the funds over the weekend showed that nearly 2.6 million individuals have exited their investments, reducing the mutual funds’ assets under management by a third on average.</td>

      <td>Best explanation for how stocks have moved so far this year is the raw price of the stock, an almost meaningless number</td>
      <td>Sometimes it’s hard to argue that market capitalism has any chance of correctly allocating money to the companies that can use it best. Case in point: Stock-market performance this year has been driven by the raw share price, with lower-priced stocks doing better and higher-priced worse.<br />Forget a careful evaluation of future cash flow, valuation, brand power, management skill or even political sensitivity. I repeat: The best explanation for how stocks have moved so far this year is the price of the stock, an almost meaningless number.<br />Stocks priced below $1 have performed the best, followed by those between $1 and $2, and so on up almost perfectly. The worst performers have share prices above $100. It looks remarkably like investors are treating a low-price share as an indicator that the stock is a bargain, and a higher price as a sign that it is worse value for money.<br />The share price on its own carries virtually no useful information: It depends entirely on how many shares the company has issued. A company can split a high priced stock to create more at a lower price, without making any difference to the intrinsic worth of the company. Equally, it can consolidate its shares to reduce the number, increasing the share price but again without any effect on how much the company should be worth.<br />The fact that the stock price at the start of the year is a near-perfect determinant of how a stock has performed is depressing, but at least in part explainable.</td>

      <td>Just when you thought e-commerce couldn’t get any hotter,  Poshmark  wants to be the life of the party.<br />The online platform, which calls itself a social shopping marketplace, saw its shares more than double in their public debut on Thursday. After a tumble Friday, Poshmark’s market value is still over $5 billion, more than a fifth of that of pandemic darling  Etsy ,  despite posting less than 12% of that company’s profit in the third quarter of last year.<br />Etsy’s shares have more than quadrupled over the past year, benefiting not only from stellar sales growth as an online marketplace but also from a pandemic-driven boom in mask sales.<br />Assuming the e-commerce frenzy in the market keeps up, Poshmark could do it one better. At its core, the platform similarly enables individuals and small businesses to market and sell goods online. But it also adds a social network aspect, incorporating likes, comments, shares and other connections through “Posh parties.” Even better, it is generally known for being a secondhand marketplace, playing into perhaps today’s hottest trend in fashion—sustainability. The U.S. online secondhand market is projected to grow 69% between 2019 and 2021, while the broader retail market shrinks 15%, according to a 2020 report from secondhand e-tail company thredUp, citing third party analytics firm GlobalData.<br />Relative to competitors, Poshmark seems to have several advantages. While it does offer personalized curation, it doesn’t hold inventory like thredUp,  RealReal  or Stitch Fix do. An asset-light model means it can quickly pivot, for example from promoting workwear to athleisure, based on changing retail trends. And its sellers don’t have to be as skilled as Etsy’s. Only so many people can handcraft jewelry or home décor; almost everyone has a piece or two of halfway decent clothing forgotten in their closet.</td>

The proposal also includes longstanding Democratic priorities, such as raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding paid leave for workers.<br />Republicans have decried the size and scope of the measure, arguing it would spend more than the economy needs. Some Republicans and Democrats have also expressed concern about the growing national debt, which at $21.6 trillion exceeds the annual output of the U.S. economy.<br />Ms. Yellen aims to address those concerns in her testimony: “Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big.”</td>

Many of those peddling the new poultry items are better known as hamburger chains, including  McDonald’s Corp. ,  Shake Shack Inc.  and  Jack in the Box Inc.<br />Restaurant operators, grappling with slowdowns and restrictions brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, aim to capture consumers’ enthusiasm for crispy, breaded-chicken sandwiches. That fervor helped build Chick-fil-A Inc. into one of the nation’s top fast-food chains over the past decade, and made Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc.’s offering a social-media sensation after its 2019 debut.<br />The chicken-sandwich war, as industry competitors describe it, means diners have lots of options—such as a Korean-style iteration at Shake Shack, a McDonald’s version topped with spicy pepper sauce and a new KFC offering that the chain bills as its “best chicken sandwich ever.” The sandwich craze also might bring lasting changes to the restaurant business, with owners spending thousands of dollars on new equipment for battering chicken filets to compete for what some franchisees say is the future of eating out.<br />Shake Shack began selling its new fried-chicken sandwich in the burger chain’s South Korean restaurants during the fall, before it made its debut in the U.S. this month. One of the first limited-time items it put on menus during the pandemic was a spicy chicken sandwich, also during the fall.</td>

      <td>Hopes for an economic rebound and a slowdown in borrowing have powered U.S. corporate bonds to a strong start in 2021.<br />As of Thursday, the average extra yield, or spread, investors demanded to hold investment-grade corporate bonds over U.S. Treasurys was 0.93 percentage points, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. That was down from 1.05 percentage points one month ago and the narrowest gap since January 2020.<br />The move reflects investors’ growing confidence that highly rated U.S. companies will endure the pandemic, boosted by vaccine rollouts, economic stimulus and easy money from the Federal Reserve. Spreads had widened sharply during 2020’s early year market turmoil, when many investors feared the pandemic would spark a wave of defaults and bankruptcies, fueling losses in corporate debt.<br />The Fed’s intervention, which included cutting interest rates and buying billions of dollars worth of bonds, helped fuel a recovery. With rates near zero, investors chased extra yield in the investment-grade market, helping companies refinance their debt at lower interest rates and raise record amounts of cash to protect balance sheets from the pandemic’s blows.<br />Now Wall Street economists are projecting a pickup in economic growth later in 2021 as vaccination efforts accelerate. Investment-grade mutual and exchange-traded funds have taken in more than $12 billion this year as of Jan. 13, according to Refinitiv Lipper, after posting the largest one-year inflow ever in 2020.</td>

This trend has been accentuated as a lack of face-to-face discussions have hurt traditional diplomacy.<br />The report is usually published just ahead of the WEF’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. This year, the meeting has been postponed because of the pandemic until May, when it will take place in Singapore.

There is less prospect of that this time: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says he wants the Fed to signal any tapering well in advance.<br />But just as important, developing markets look better insulated than in 2013.<br />It wasn’t just the taper tantrum itself that mattered for emerging markets but the currency-market shifts during the subsequent year. The ICE Dollar Index rose by as much as 25% from the spring of 2014 to the spring of 2015. That surge disrupted years of planning by corporations and governments, which had anticipated a relatively weak dollar, something that seemed like the new normal for almost a decade.<br />That wouldn’t be the case today. For one, the dollar’s decline in 2020 was far smaller than its mid-2000s plunge. A similar climb would take the dollar into rarefied territory seen only between 2000 and 2002.

He said he would have left earlier, but a transition official for President-elect Joe Biden invited him to continue serving as bureau director, and “under other circumstances” he would have been honored to stay in his post under the new president.<br />Mr. Dillingham’s resignation comes after the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General issued a memo that raised concerns about his directive for career officials to produce a report that “includes data on documented and undocumented persons in the United States.” Career officials said they were “under significant pressure to produce this technical report,” the OIG memo said.<br />The memo inquired how Mr. Dillingham would ensure the data quality of the report and why the Census Bureau director prioritized the report.<br />Mr. Dillingham addressed the inspector general’s memo at length in his resignation announcement. Mr. Dillingham defended the data request and said it “was not an attempt to release 2020 census data results for apportionment early.”</td>

      <td>Pence, Kudlow, Rao, Pai and more: Here are the Trump appointees and policies that served the country.</td>
      <td>As the Trump Presidency ends in the disgrace of the Capitol riot, an effort is already underway to erase everything in the last four years as disgraceful too. That’s a lie—a Big Lie, to borrow the cliché of the moment. Donald Trump’s profound character flaws need to be separated from what so many people in his Administration accomplished for the country.<br />These men and women didn’t “enable” Donald Trump. Sixty-three million Americans did that when they elected him in 2016, with a significant assist from the Democrats who nominated Hillary Clinton, perhaps the only candidate who could have lost to Mr. Trump.<br />Mr. Trump appointed people who had the usual varying combinations of conviction and ambition. They served despite the hostility of the bureaucracy and press, and a President who often didn’t appreciate their work. Sometimes—in some cases, often—they protected the country by stopping Mr. Trump from his worst impulses.<br />We can’t list everyone who contributed, but before the Biden Presidency begins we thought we’d link some of those who did their jobs well with the successful policies they promoted. We’ve already saluted Betsy DeVos at Education and Ajit Pai at the Federal Communications Commission. Here’s a sample of other significant people and policies:<br />• Larry Kudlow, Kevin Hassett, Casey Mulligan, Gary Cohn, and others on the economic team. The pandemic-lockdown recession has obscured that the pre-Covid U.S. economy was the strongest since the 1990s. Unlike the Obama years, the benefits of growth were widely dispersed, wage gains were strongest for the least skilled, and poverty saw its sharpest decline in decades.</td>

      <td>Elise Stefanik grew up in a working-class family in upstate New York, where her father and mother ran a small plywood distribution business. After getting accepted to Harvard, she became not only the first Ivy Leaguer in her family but also the first to graduate from college.<br />“I’ll never forget what my dad told me the summer before my freshman year,” she tells me. “He said, ‘Elise, I can’t tell you what to expect or what’s going to happen because I never had this experience. I know you will do well and we will be proud of you. All I ask is that you remember where you came from.’ ”<br />He was right: His daughter would make him proud. Two days before she graduated from Harvard in 2006, she received a job offer from the George W. Bush White House (where I was a colleague). Afterward she helped on various Republican campaigns before returning home for a stint with the family business.<br />Then, in 2014, she ran for Congress—and won—in New York’s 21st, a mostly rural, upstate district between Albany and Canada. At the time she was 30, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.<br />But now she’s not good enough for Harvard.</td>

      <td>But formidable global challenges await Joe Biden as he moves into the White House.</td>
      <td>Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Ali Khamenei, Nicolás Maduro and Kim Jong Un doubtless were gleefully munching their popcorn as the violent fringe of a large pro-Trump demonstration stormed the halls of Congress earlier this month. The rioting in Washington and the militarization of the capital for this week’s inauguration telegraph American instability and weakness—something that cheered every U.S. adversary and alarmed every friend around the world.<br />That said, the national and global doom-mongering is overdone. President Trump’s false claims and incendiary rhetoric ignited an ugly incident, not a constitutional crisis. Mr. Trump is too weak and American democracy too strong for any other result. Fundamental U.S. constitutional structures were never in peril. Up and down the line, state election officials from both parties followed the appropriate procedures, at times in the face of bullying and threats.<br />Distinguished lawyers of impeccable Republican and conservative credentials declined to lend their reputations to the weak claims that the president’s campaign sought to litigate. And when those cases came up for judicial scrutiny, courts filled with Trump appointees decided them according to the law. Even those representatives and senators who failed in their duty by echoing the president’s unfounded, inflammatory claims did so secure in the knowledge that their cynical grandstanding wouldn’t overturn the legal process. The American military’s commitment to constitutional order never wavered.<br />The weary capital could still see more violence on Inauguration Day, but the republic stands. The momentary frenzy of a mob or the histrionic demagoguery of a defeated president and his most opportunistic allies notwithstanding, there has not been a moment when there was a real possibility that Mr. Trump’s term of office would extend past its constitutionally mandated close.<br />Counterintuitively, the real message of the 2020 election is that the U.S. remains strong. Voters elected, electors voted, and the transfer of power proceeds apace. A perfect storm—a destructive pandemic, an economic maelstrom, a crisis in race relations, a bitter election campaign and, in the end, the effort of a defeated president to foment all the trouble he could—still couldn’t prevent the constitutional process from taking its course.</td>

      <td>Since 2003, two activist judges on the Third Circuit have been arbitrarily stalling FCC innovation.</td>
      <td>Two judges on the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals have spent the past 17 years blocking a congressionally mandated modernization of antiquated broadcast-television regulations. The Supreme Court will hear an appeal Tuesday, FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, giving broadcasters the chance to be unshackled from restrictions this activist court continues to impose on them—which are contrary to court precedent and statute and make no sense in light of the competition from digital media.<br />At stake are Federal Communications Commission rules that would allow broadcasters to compete more efficiently against less-regulated tech companies, invest more in local news gathering, and strengthen their position as a crucial conduit for free speech.<br />Decades ago, over-the-air broadcast television was the dominant medium on which Americans relied for news, weather and entertainment. To curb broadcasters’ clout, in the mid-20th century the FCC heavily regulated the industry and limited how many TV stations a single owner could have. Congress saw competition coming from cable and the internet and enacted a deregulatory law known as Section 202(h) of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. It mandates that the FCC “shall” repeal or modify any broadcast-ownership rule it determines is no longer “necessary in the public interest as the result of competition.” The Third Circuit’s legal misinterpretation of this statute and the FCC’s obligation to act in the “public interest” are at the heart of the appeal.<br />Over the decades, the FCC, not Congress, created a broad definition of the “public interest” when it came to broadcast ownership rules. Among many factors, the agency has included five different types of “diversity” in its analysis: viewpoint, outlet, program, source and minority and female ownership. But in 1996 Congress singled out “competition,” not diversity, as the primary factor for the FCC to consider in its public-interest analysis.<br />Lawmakers intended Section 202(h) to give broadcasters the freedom to create defensive combinations and economies of scale, thereby liberating capital to invest in societally beneficial programming such as local news and severe-weather warnings. Today broadcasters face declining viewership and slumping ad dollars as viewers turn to alternatives on the internet. Local over-the-air TV ad revenue has plummeted more than 40% since 2000, adjusted for inflation, and the pandemic has made matters worse. Meanwhile, online ad purchases have skyrocketed. Google’s share of local ad revenue in 2019 alone, about $17 billion, was equal to all the local ad income of every TV station across the country combined.</td>

      <td>Daniel Ek wanted to bring Napster’s idea of a musical smorgasbord into the world of legal streaming. Would record labels play along?</td>
      <td>Neil Young, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham owe Daniel Ek an enormous debt of gratitude right about now. The rock legends have all recently sold their song publishing rights for gigantic sums, sell-offs that can partially be attributed to the surge in digital revenue that accounts for more than half the global recorded-music market. One man saw all this coming before anyone else: Mr. Ek, the 37-year-old co-founder of Spotify, the world’s largest streaming service with 320 million users and counting.<br />For those of us who regularly call up almost any song we desire with a tap on our phone screens, it’s easy to think of streaming music as an inevitable development. But for Mr. Ek, streaming’s triumph was more of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Having endured years of pushback, Spotify has been at the vanguard of a global revolution in the way music is consumed. It’s quite a turnabout for the Stockholm native, who has endured heaps of negative press, the enmity of underpaid musicians everywhere, and the looming threat of competing services from Apple, Jay-Z’s Tidal and many others.<br />Co-written by two veteran reporters who have closely tracked the Swedish technology sector, “The Spotify Play” (translated into English by the authors themselves) delivers an outsider-to-kingmaker narrative that should be read by every gun-shy entrepreneur too spooked by Silicon Valley’s giants to go head-to-head with them. Mr. Ek has outlasted his competitors and defied his critics: His triumphs are soundtracked by 1.5 billion user-generated Spotify playlists.<br />A rabid music fan as a teenager, Mr. Ek’s exposure to Napster was a profound conversion experience. Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker’s file-sharing service was the shrapnel blast that tore holes through the web’s commercial firewalls. “Napster is probably the internet service which has changed my life more than anything else,” Mr. Ek once told an interviewer. What if he could merge Napster’s peer-to-peer technology with commercial content? What if he could draw file-sharing out of the shadows?<br />Even while Mr. Ek was rapidly moving up as a programmer in Stockholm’s hot tech market, the notion of a legal answer to Napster’s music streaming never left him. In 2006 Mr. Ek’s tiny startup Advertigo was acquired by Tradedoubler, a digital marketing company whose co-founder Martin Lorentzon was enamored of Mr. Ek and his ideas. The savvy, flamboyant Mr. Lorentzon would become both partner and cheerleader. When he came to visit Mr. Ek in his raffish Stockholm neighborhood, Mr. Ek quoted “The Godfather” at him: “Put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun.”</td>

      <td>Quant pioneer Renaissance Technologies LLC sent clients an analysis of its performance and a rationalization of recent deep losses, an unusual move for one of Wall Street’s most secretive firms.<br />In the letter sent late Friday, the firm said losses of between 20% and 30% in 2020 for its three funds open to outside investors should have been expected at some point during the course of the funds’ histories. The letter partly blamed heightened volatility for the weak performance.<br />Still, some clients said the letter was short on meaningful explanations.<br />The decision to reach out to investors with a letter follows an awful year for several of Renaissance’s hedge funds, with some clients having expressed unhappiness in recent days. The weak performance of some of the firm’s outside funds has spurred investor withdrawals. Renaissance manages nearly $60 billion firmwide, down from about $75 billion a year ago.<br />“Although recent performance has been terrible and worse than prior performance would have suggested was likely for 2020,” the letter says, “in track records as long as ours, some risk-return ratios every bit as bad as the ones we are now seeing are not shocking.”</td>

She will also play a key role in pushing the administration’s economic agenda on Capitol Hill, a job that will start in earnest Tuesday, said Tony Fratto, a senior Treasury and White House aide in the George W. Bush administration.<br />Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, unveiled last week, provides for another round of direct stimulus payments, extended and enhanced jobless benefits, funding for schools and first responders and the creation of a nationwide vaccination program. It also includes longstanding Democratic priorities, such as raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding paid leave for workers.</td>

Total plans to spend $3 billion a year on renewables by 2030, around 20% of its annual investment budget and up from $2 billion last year.<br />The Adani deal gives Total exposure to a leading renewables business in India, one of the world’s fastest-growing markets for energy demand. Adani has 54 wind and solar projects in operation across the country, including one of the world’s largest solar projects in Kamuthi, Southern India. Based on existing generating capacity and the projects in its pipeline, Adani is the world’s largest developer of solar power, Total said.<br />As part of the deal, Total is also taking a 50% stake in a portfolio of Adani’s solar assets and getting a seat on the company’s board. The move will help Total toward its goal of having 35 gigawatts of renewable power capacity by 2025, up from around 7 gigawatts last year.</td>
