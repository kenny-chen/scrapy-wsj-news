      <td>The Trump administration is releasing second doses of coronavirus vaccines that were reserved for booster shots and is urging states to give the vaccine to anyone age 65 and older, as well as to people with pre-existing health conditions, a shift in strategy that vastly expands the pool of those eligible for shots while presenting another hurdle for the logistics of administering the vaccine at state and local levels.<br />Starting in two weeks, doses will be allocated based on the pace that states say they are administering the vaccine, as well as the size of a state’s population of people age 65 and older.<br />Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the plan on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Tuesday. “We now believe that our manufacturing is predictable enough that we can ensure second doses are available to people from ongoing production. So everything is now available to our states and our health-care providers,” he said.<br />The government had been allocating about half of newly available doses from  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  to states since the vaccine rollout began last month. Federal officials said there is enough supply to ensure booster shots will be available and that they won’t extend the current recommended dosing schedules.<br />Drug makers expect to be able to produce enough vaccine doses to accommodate the new plans, vaccine manufacturers and supply-chain experts say.</td>

      <td>The justices will decide whether student who sued Georgia state college can collect attorneys’ fees after school dropped policies</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday considered expanding the financial liability that public colleges and other government entities can face for infringing free-speech rights, even after they repeal restrictions challenged as unconstitutional.<br />In 2016, a student at Georgia Gwinnett College began passing out religious literature on a campus plaza, only to be stopped by a police officer who told him to reserve one of two tiny so-called speech zones for such activities. Later, when the student did so, he said, another officer stopped him from speaking because of complaints over his remarks.<br />The student, Chike Uzuegbunam, sued the Lawrenceville, Ga., school for violating his First Amendment rights. College administrators reversed course, opening the entire campus to student speech with minimal restrictions, and a federal judge dismissed the case as moot. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, upheld that decision.<br />That left Mr. Uzuegbunam, who since has graduated, without a dollar in compensation from the college—and, a dollar, what courts call nominal compensation, is what he was seeking. More significantly, it frustrated the advocacy group representing him, Alliance Defending Freedom, from collecting attorneys’ fees and costs from the school.<br />In that the policy had been rescinded and Mr. Uzuegbunam obtained his degree, several justices questioned whether there were any grounds for damages.</td>

      <td>A Philadelphia nonprofit can’t open the nation’s first sanctioned, supervised site for drug users because the concept violates federal drug law, a three-judge federal appeals-court panel ruled.<br />Tuesday’s decision raised another barrier for the nonprofit Safehouse, which has long planned what is commonly called a safe-injection site to combat fatal drug overdoses, but has faced legal opposition and other delays. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said in a 2-1 ruling that only federal lawmakers can make such a site legal.<br />“Its motives are admirable,” Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote for the majority, regarding Safehouse. “But Congress has made it a crime to open a property to others to use drugs.”<br />Safehouse aims to open a site that would offer broad support for drug users, including a room where they can take drugs with supervision so that someone can quickly intervene and treat an overdose. Supporters say the concept, already used in places like Europe and Canada but novel in the U.S., will save lives and help people get access to treatment.<br />Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia sued two years ago, arguing Safehouse would violate part of a 1986 antidrug law that makes it illegal to knowingly host illicit drug use and other drug-related activity. Safehouse won a favorable lower-court ruling in late 2019, but the appeals-court panel’s majority sided with local U.S. Attorney William McSwain’s interpretation of the law.</td>

      <td>Yield on 10-year Treasury note still on course to rise for seventh consecutive trading session</td>
      <td>U.S. government-bond yields pared an early climb Tuesday after a Treasury Department auction of new 10-year notes met strong demand from investors.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed at 1.136% according to Tradeweb, down from above 1.18% before the sale. That is barely changed from 1.131% Monday.<br />Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, declined after asset managers and other buyers scooped up the majority of $38 billion worth of new government debt, leaving bond dealers with around 20% of the securities. Treasury prices often fall when dealers win larger shares at the auctions, a sign of weak demand from investors.<br />The 10-year yield, a key barometer for borrowing costs throughout the economy, still headed for a seventh consecutive daily gain, extending a march above 1% that began after Democrats won control of the Senate. The prospects for greater government spending, along with economic growth and inflation, helped push the yield out of its relatively narrow, post-pandemic range near all-time lows.<br />Asset managers were keenly watching the results of Tuesday’s auction to gauge whether the recent bond selloff would continue or whether yields will settle in a new range. Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said it marked “something of an inflection point for rates,” in a note to clients.</td>

Data won’t initially be made public for individual hospitals, according to senior HHS officials. HHS expects to make the data public after verifying its quality, they said.<br />Hospital workers were among the first to be immunized from the limited early U.S. supply of vaccines because of their exposure to the virus and critical work. But the national rollout of vaccines has been slow and rocky. Hospitals largely haven’t mandated workers get the vaccine. Surveys show not all personnel are willing to be immunized.<br />Vaccinations through the end of last year reached about 2.8 million administered doses, far less than the federal goal of 20 million.<br />The Trump administration said Tuesday it would release additional vaccine supplies, and called for immunization of adults older than 65 and those with health issues that put them at risk. The extra vaccines are doses that had been set aside as the second of the two required shots.</td>

If Mr. Pence doesn’t act, Democrats have said they would move forward with an impeachment vote Wednesday, and would have enough votes even without GOP support.<br />Mr. Trump, in his first comments to reporters in several days, criticized Democrats for seeking to impeach him, calling it a “continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics” and said the move was “causing tremendous anger.”<br />He also called for “no violence,” as concerns mount about the possibility of more violent protests around Inauguration Day.<br />The president defended himself against criticism that his efforts to rile up his supporters about baseless claims of election fraud led to last week’s riot. “They’ve analyzed my speech…my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody just thought it was totally appropriate,” he said.</td>

      <td>Elite auction houses like Sotheby’s are betting on rare sneakers and sought-after streetwear. Here, what’s earned the highest hammer prices and how to spot items that could someday be worth a bundle.</td>
      <td>On Trend is a weekly column on men’s style that explores fashion’s subcultures and of-the-moment curiosities.<br />IN LATE December 2020, the venerated auction house Sotheby’s hosted an online-only sale of a pair of leather Adidas sneakers. Made in partnership with the 311-year-old porcelain-maker Meissen specifically for the auction, the shoes had been festooned with porcelain overlays and meticulously hand-painted with fanciful motifs from toe to heel, a six-month process that elevated humble sweat repositories to something approaching art. To the highest bidder, the sneakers were worth $126,000. (All proceeds went to the Brooklyn Museum.)<br />These extravagant Adidas shoes are among the sneakers and high-end streetwear pieces that have been infiltrating the tony auction market of late. In July 2019, Sotheby’s sold a historic set of  Nike ’s  “Moon Shoe” waffle-soled sneakers from 1972 for a then-record-setting $437,500. A pair of game-worn Michael Jordan sneakers has since sold for more.<br />Much of the streetwear now on the auction block was sold via traditional retail shops just a few years earlier—with their auction-hammer prices dwarfing their original prices. Last September, a 2017 Supreme hoodie made in partnership with Louis Vuitton sold at Sotheby’s in New York for $6,048, far more than the $935 it commanded at retail. In October at Bonhams in London, a pair of 2018 Nike x Off-White Jordan 1 sneakers fetched around $2,750, an increase of 1,347% over their $190 retail price. And in November 2019, a Supreme-branded Rimowa suitcase earned roughly $6,400 at Christie’s in Hong Kong. The suitcase had hit the retail market in 2018 at $1,800.<br />Treating sneakers as re-sellable assets is hardly a new concept. In the early 2000s Jordan Geller, the founder of sneaker museum Shoezeum, began buying sneakers at California swap meets to resell for profit on  eBay .  Internet flippers like him built out a big-money market for theretofore overlooked Nikes and Adidas as well as limited-run Supreme gear. Eventually, Mr. Geller amassed a mammoth personal collection of sneakers, including the Nike Moon Shoes that he would later sell through Sotheby’s for as much as a Picasso sketch.</td>

      <td>To conquer the clutter in our homes we must also be ready to deal with the many emotions buried in it, says Jes Marcy, a professional organizer in Poestenkill, N.Y. Ms. Marcy leads online classes on how to get rid of unnecessary items and on social media runs a private support group for people trying to organize their homes, a process that can be fraught with stress, guilt, resentment and grief, she says.<br />Ms. Marcy tells clients that when they start to unclutter their homes of physical possessions they inevitably will find connections to emotional, financial and relationship issues in their lives, too. “It’s all clutter and it’s all connected,” she says.<br />Ms. Marcy discussed how to navigate decluttering landmines, why you shouldn’t buy anything to get organized and how to deal with boxes of items that could draw tears. Edited excerpts:<br />How has the pandemic affected people’s relationship with clutter?<br />For some people it has sparked this idea that we need to stockpile. Others say “I’m going to lose my mind if I have to look at this stuff any longer.” There comes a point where stockpiling is more hazardous than not stockpiling. Physical hazards exist with clutter because you can trip, it creates dust and mold and it can be a fire hazard. Anybody who has lived through a natural disaster or any sort of emergency will             attest that skills are more important than stockpiles. We’re also realizing the importance of having functional space. We don’t tend to look at our space, except maybe our kitchen counters, as functional space. For years we’ve been converting space in our house to storage. Then we take away that ability to add a desk when we need to, for example.</td>

      <td>We were right to be confident in him as we doubted Trump.</td>
      <td>Twenty sixteen seems like a lifetime ago, but it’s been fewer than five years since conservatives like me were struggling to accept Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president. Mr. Trump was a thrice-married New York casino magnate, who had given thousands of dollars to liberal politicians including Chuck Schumer and Kamala Harris. Now he was poised to lead the Party of Reagan?<br />I had my own personal confrontations with Mr. Trump. In 2011 he called me a “loser.” I immediately phoned to remind the not-always successful developer that not winning at everything doesn’t make you a loser—that learning from your defeats makes you a winner. He told me I was “too conservative” and “too pro-life.” A few months later he endorsed Mitt Romney.<br />So when he was about to secure the 2016 nomination, conservatives like me needed reassurance that he would follow through on the campaign promises he was making. Much of that reassurance came in the form of Mike Pence.<br />I have known Mr. Pence for 20 years. He is a trusted conservative and, more important, a good man. He served in the House while I was in the Senate. In 2010, when we were both considering 2012 presidential runs, Mike and I had several conversations about our visions, the issues that were driving us to run, and the family considerations we were struggling with. Not until he decided to run for governor of Indiana did I feel compelled to seek the presidency.<br />We have seen the vice president’s hand in much of Mr. Trump’s accomplishments over the past four years. We saw the man who called me “too pro-life” become the most pro-life president, the first to address the March for Life. We saw it in the nomination of committed constitutionalists like Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And we saw it in the regulatory reforms the administration has made to improve the economic climate.</td>

      <td>The fight over who gets the shot first is slowing the rollout. Date of birth is the best proxy for level of risk.</td>
      <td>The distribution of Covid vaccines is proceeding slowly even as a new, faster-moving viral variant arrives from London. The number of vaccinations administered last month was less than 25% of the original projections, while Covid hospitalizations and deaths reached new highs across the country. Perhaps inoculations will pick up in the coming weeks, but this has been what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls “Phase A,” when the serum is reserved for two highly accessible, readily identifiable groups: health-care workers and nursing-home residents.<br />“Phase B” could be much worse. It is true that the CDC finally said on Tuesday that it would release doses initially held back for second injections and that the shots should be available to anyone over 65 and those with pre-existing conditions. But states still have wide latitude to set priorities. Many are still deliberating, and some have turned the question over to officials at the county or even hospital level. Other states are sorting the elderly between those who have two or more comorbidities and those who don’t.<br />In many states, essential workers have been assigned priority. They are spreaders, it is said. They encounter the public when policing the streets, stocking shelves at grocery stores, or teaching in schools. The definition of essential worker has at times expanded to include Uber drivers, meatpackers and all those in the retail and manufacturing industries. The head of the Texas Restaurant Association says prioritization should go to those helping to “feed Texans.”<br />Each addition and distinction may seem reasonable, but the cost in delay and confusion is high. Covid vaccinations are proving more complicated than the flu shot. Out of an abundance of caution, some hospitals are requiring recipients to be tested for Covid first, and then wait 15 minutes after the vaccination to check for an allergic reaction. Applying the Phase B regulations will add to these delays. How does a person prove employment or a health condition? Must pharmacies turn away applicants who lack supporting documentation? With all these delays, summer could come and go before Phase B ends and the general public can finally be vaccinated.<br />It is time for simplification. To deliver free vaccines with maximum speed, the health-care system needs to follow a simple rule that applies to everyone. Fortunately, such a rule is readily available: date of birth. The older the person, the higher the priority. One can prove one’s age simply by showing a driver’s license, Medicare or Medicaid card, or another form of identification. For most, that information is already embedded in the files of hospitals, pharmacies and doctors’ offices.</td>

To stay alive, the self-professed free-speech social platform must find a new vendor willing to host its data after some of the app’s users stoked last week’s deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters seeking to stop certification of the election results. Alternatively, Parler could build its own network infrastructure, although that approach could lead to further delays resuming its service.<br />Potential cloud operators other than Amazon include  Microsoft Corp.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google. The search-giant declined to comment. Last week it pulled Parler from its app store, saying some users’ content incited violence—the same argument Amazon made in withdrawing its service.<br />Parler was still using Microsoft email services as of Monday. Microsoft said it has had no contact with Parler about hosting its data and wouldn’t comment on customers using its email service.<br />Parler also wouldn’t run on  Oracle Corp.’s  growing cloud business, a person familiar with the matter said.</td>

      <td>Albertsons is spinning a lot of plates while the going is good. The question is what it will focus on when things get less easy.<br />The grocer, which also owns the Jewel-Osco and Safeway chains, exceeded analyst sales expectations for a second consecutive quarter, with identical-store sales increasing by 12.3% from a year earlier in the quarter ended Dec. 5. That exceeded the growth rate of  Kroger  and  Walmart  for the comparable period and was roughly 2 percentage points better than the broad industry, according to Evercore ISI.<br />Net income for the quarter came in almost 40% below Wall Street estimates, though that number looks much worse due to a charge to withdraw from a union pension fund. Excluding that impact, net income blew past expectations.<br />The grocery chain’s traditional focus on fresh products is continuing to pay off, with sales growth in that category higher than the total. That turns out to be an important advantage. As consumers across the board are making fewer shopping trips, those that pick up fresh produce tend to drop by stores more frequently, Albertsons noted in its Tuesday morning earnings call.<br />In other areas, Albertsons is still playing catch up. Digital sales continued to impress, growing 225% from a year earlier. It was the third consecutive quarter in which digital sales increased by more than 200%, though the caveat is that Albertsons’ started out with a smaller e-commerce base than some of its competitors.</td>

The order is expected to go into effect Jan. 26, according to a person familiar with the matter. The CDC and other administration officials were still completing the order.<br />The CDC order for universal testing of passengers, including for U.S. citizens returning from abroad, comes weeks after the Trump administration imposed a testing requirement for travelers from the U.K. over concerns about a more infectious strain of the virus that was detected there. Since then, the new strain has been found elsewhere in the world, and its presence in the U.S. has been confirmed.<br />The U.S. requirement comes during a difficult time for the aviation industry and international travelers who face a thicket of varied testing protocols and quarantine requirements around the world, including public-health advisories urging people to stay home.<br />U.S. airlines have voiced support for the new requirement but argued that ramped-up testing protocols should take the place of travel restrictions and quarantines to reduce the spread of Covid-19.</td>

Cybersecurity experts suspect preparations for the attack go back far longer. A month later, a version of the company’s Orion Platform software appears to have contained modifications designed to test the hackers ability to insert malicious code into the system. The code was added starting Feb. 20, 2020, SolarWinds said, and the compromised software was available to its customers by March 26, 2020.<br />Intelligence officials have said the attack was one of the most sophisticated cyber intrusions of U.S. systems they had seen.<br />SolarWinds, working with hired cybersecurity experts, said it reverse-engineered the malicious code, called Sunburst, allowing them to learn more about the hack. The Austin, Texas-based company said an analysis suggests that hackers circumvented detection by mimicking legitimate network traffic that was run through U.S. servers. It is still trying to establish how the code entered its software and went undetected, the company said.<br />The investigation showed that the hackers removed the code from the system in June.

Many consumers are shopping for groceries less frequently, buying greater amounts of food when they do and at times splurging on premium food products.<br />“We continue to see fewer trips per household but larger baskets,” Albertsons Chief Executive Vivek Sankaran said Tuesday on a call with analysts.<br />Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons said sales at stores open at least 15 months, excluding fuel, rose 12.3% for the quarter ended Dec. 5. The sales growth reflected a slight decline from the prior quarter, when the company posted a 13.8% increase, but it beat expectations and was higher than sales growth at other grocers such as  Kroger Co.  and  Walmart Inc.<br />“We are encouraged that customers spending more time at home are looking to us,” Mr. Sankaran said.</td>

And that starts with recognizing that people are not just consumers. They are also workers and wage earners.”<br />The emphasis on protecting U.S. jobs was a guiding principle of the Trump administration’s trade policy, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Monday, in which he credited Ms. Tai for helping win Democratic support for the USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement.<br />Ms. Tai has spent much of her career in the government, first as a lawyer for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, then as a congressional staff member.

Even though Camp Robin Hood, located in Freedom, N.H., had a solid plan to create a safety bubble, Mr. Ratner knew there was a risk of a Covid outbreak.<br />After three rounds of testing, including one before camp, and strict enforcement of mask-wearing, director Richard Woodstein called everyone together, turned up the music and announced the good news: Everyone tested negative. Campers ripped off their masks, hugged each other and danced.<br />Mr. Ratner soon received a letter from his 11-year-old daughter Lila. That moment was one of the greatest days of her life, she wrote. “Right now I don’t feel like corona is a thing and I am so happy.”<br />Lila and her 13-year-old brother, Noah, who haven’t been to school in person since last March, are already signed up for summer 2021. “I feel much more confident than last year. I know what to expect,” says Mr. Ratner, an attorney in Potomac, Md.<br />Overnight camp has always been a way to give children an experience removed from the realities of everyday life—a place to run free, learn new things and make lifelong friendships. Rarely have such joys been as amplified as during the Covid-19 pandemic, as many students have felt isolated most of the year, spending their time in front of computers and away from peers, unable to participate in sports, music or drama.</td>

Vigtory will also be available to those outside of the FuboTV subscriber base. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.<br />FuboTV launched about six years ago as a way for Americans to stream foreign soccer games, only to become a fully fledged alternative to the traditional cable-TV package. It competes with other over-the-internet bundles, including  Alphabet Inc.’s  YouTube TV,  Walt Disney Co. ’s Hulu + Live TV and  AT&T Inc.’s  AT&T TV Now. The company does have a broader emphasis on foreign sports—particularly soccer—than most of its competitors.<br />Many media companies have been teaming up with online sportsbooks, which are operated by digital companies such as  DraftKings Inc.  and FanDuel Group and bricks-and-mortar casino operators. Sportsbooks are growing in popularity as sports wagering expands across the U.S., a practice that has so far been legalized in 25 states and the District of Columbia. The U.S. sports-betting market is projected to reach about $13.5 billion by 2025, based on 38 states legalizing sports wagering by then, according to an estimate from  MGM Resorts International .<br />Last fall ESPN reached a deal with DraftKings and  Caesars Entertainment Inc.  to connect its audience to the gambling operators’ sportsbooks across digital platforms.

With vaccines raising hopes for a recovery, Airbus said it is preparing to increase production after slowing output last year.<br />Boeing, in contrast, has become more reliant on sales of cargo and military jets to ease the strain on its finances caused by the prolonged grounding of the 737 MAX and manufacturing problems that have halted deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner.<br />The plane maker handed over 157 jets last year, including cargo and military planes, trailing the 566 deliveries at Airbus.</td>

Millions will need to file tax returns to get the balance they are owed for stimulus payments.

All of that will happen as the IRS implements new laws and completes the second, $600 round of stimulus payments approved by Congress last month.<br />“It’s going to be a nightmare,” said Nina Olson, who was an in-house IRS watchdog from 2001 to 2019. “They’ve got a rough filing season ahead, no matter how well you plan for it.”<br />In a typical year, the IRS would begin allowing people to file returns in late January.

      <td>Billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a giant in the casino-resort industry and one of the largest donors to the Republican Party, has died at the age of 87.<br />As a young man, Mr. Adelson seemed to lack focus. The son of an immigrant Jewish cabdriver, he flitted from one business to another, dabbling in mortgage brokerage, investment advice, venture capital, real estate, chartered tours and sales of De-Ice-It spray for windshields.<br />In his mid-30s, Mr. Adelson began finding his way as an entrepreneur who would become one of the world’s richest men, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $35.9 billion. He made himself into a giant in the casino industry with his lucrative resorts, one of the largest donors to the Republican Party, a leading backer of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a newspaper publisher in Nevada and Israel.<br />Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced the death of its chairman and chief executive in a statement Tuesday, less than a week after the company said he was taking a medical leave for cancer treatment. In March 2019, the company said Mr. Adelson had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.<br />His unlikely rise from obscurity began when he launched a trade publication for data-communications firms in the 1970s. Mr. Adelson noticed that other publishers sponsored trade shows. So, in 1979, near the beginning of the personal-computer boom, he launched Computer Dealers Exposition, or Comdex, which became a hugely successful trade exhibit held in Las Vegas and other cities. In 1988, needing space for his own exhibition center in Las Vegas to accommodate growing crowds, he bought the Sands hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip for $110 million, opening up a new line of business.</td>

      <td>If golf courses and resorts struggle to attract and keep members, it would weigh on the overall Trump Organization</td>
      <td>The storming of the Capitol last week by a pro-Trump mob will ratchet up the pressure on President Trump’s family business at a moment when some of his most lucrative assets were already suffering from the pandemic and facing looming debt payments.<br />One of the Trump Organization’s most loyal partners, German lender  Deutsche Bank AG , is moving to distance itself from the president’s businesses and is unlikely to lend it more money, says a person familiar with the matter. The bank has lent the Trump Organization more than $300 million that will mature in 2023 and 2024, forcing the company to refinance the debt or pay it off by potentially selling assets.<br />The other risk to the Trump Organization is that some customers stop patronizing its businesses, in particular its hotels and golf courses. The company has tried to sell its Washington, D.C., hotel, but the pandemic made buyers wary. The hotel was popular with supporters of Mr. Trump and with organizations trying to seek favor from the president. Business had already been expected to decline there once Mr. Trump leaves office.<br />The Trump Organization’s golf courses and resorts are particularly important, accounting for nearly half of the company’s annual revenue. The courses are closely associated with the president and have used his name to attract customers in a weak market for golf. If the courses struggle to attract and keep members, it would weigh on the Trump Organization overall.<br />On Sunday, PGA of America said it was terminating an agreement to hold the 2022 PGA Championship at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, citing risk to its brand of being affiliated with Mr. Trump. The Trump Organization said that the PGA’s decision was a “breach of a binding contract.”</td>

Former Attorney General William Barr and other federal law-enforcement officials have said there was no evidence of fraud in Michigan or elsewhere sufficient to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss to President-elect Joe Biden.<br />Lawyers for the city of Detroit last week asked a federal judge in Michigan’s Eastern District to reprimand the lawyers who brought one of the lawsuits alleging fraud—including Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood, who worked with the Trump campaign—and to refer them for disbarment and impose financial penalties.<br />“The extent of the factual and legal errors in this complaint would warrant sanctions under any circumstances, but here the court’s processes are being perverted to undermine our democracy and to upset the peaceful transfer of power,” Detroit’s lawyer, David Fink, wrote to U.S. District Judge Linda V. Parker.<br />The lawsuit was filed on behalf of several Michigan voters, claiming that Michigan election officials used election software designed by foreign dictators to manipulate the vote, along with other unproven illegal conduct at the polls.</td>

While some of these companies authorized buying back their own shares even before the coronavirus pandemic, they are betting that with a vaccine rollout under way, travel, office work and mall shopping will bounce back after a terrible year for major property types.<br />Brookfield Asset Management Inc.  took this strategy one step further last week, when it offered to buy the nearly 40% stake in  Brookfield Property Partners  LP it doesn’t already own for $5.9 billion.

Lyft officials shared their analysis of public data with the Biden team on the millions of at-risk people who lack health-care transportation benefits or have limited public transportation due to coronavirus, she said.<br />Separately, Uber said Tuesday it is joining with vaccine maker  Moderna Inc.  to provide users with vaccine-safety information via the ride-sharing app. The companies said they aim to work with public-health agencies to help those eligible for doses to schedule rides and receive reminder notifications.<br />The pandemic has weighed on ride-sharing companies as the spreading virus shut down restaurants and curbed social gatherings and travel. Ferrying people to vaccine sites could boost their business in the near term and may help kick-start a rollout that has gone more slowly than federal officials planned.<br />Both major ride-sharing companies have talked to public-health officials across the country about helping with appointment transport, according to people familiar with those discussions, and have publicly offered millions of free rides to and from vaccine-administration sites. Ms. Callahan said state and municipal officials from heavily populated areas have been asking Lyft for free rides “because they do not have the funds.”</td>

      <td>After last week’s special Senate elections in Georgia, Democrats are about to attain unified—though narrow—control of Washington. With that, the economy will likely be at the receiving end of significantly more federal support than most on Wall Street had expected.<br />It is a shift that could change the contours of the U.S. economy in the year ahead, accelerating the rebound that will likely come as more Americans are vaccinated against Covid-19 and allowing the Federal Reserve to begin lifting its foot off the accelerator sooner. It also could bring about higher taxes, more regulation and stepped-up deficit worries, but those concerns might not be front and center for some time.<br />One of Congress’s first orders of business following President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20 will likely be putting forward another relief package in response to the Covid-19 crisis. Before Georgia’s special elections, when many thought at least one Republican candidate would prevail, leaving the Senate under GOP control, economists and political analysts didn’t expect much in the way of additional aid. That has changed.<br />Now, another round of relief is widely expected, with the money likely going toward some combination of another round of household checks, an extension of enhanced unemployment benefits that are set to expire mid-March, small-business support and, perhaps, more state and local aid. Later there would be a push for spending aimed at infrastructure projects and clean-energy programs.<br />The scope for spending could be more limited than in the blue-wave scenarios Wall Streeters contemplated ahead of November’s election that foresaw Democrats gaining, rather than losing, seats in the House and capturing a bigger lead in the Senate. Moderate Democratic representatives and senators will hold more sway, and they will balk if they believe the price tag has become too high. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a centrist Democrat, already has indicated he would like additional household relief efforts to be targeted at people in need, as opposed to another round of payments that go to most Americans.</td>

Output cuts by large suppliers from Saudi Arabia to U.S. companies are turbocharging the advance, giving traders confidence that demand will exceed supply.<br />Prices have hit new peaks since Saudi Arabia said last week it would unilaterally cut output in February as part of an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia. The supply curbs instilled faith that the cartel will remain flexible with output even if the pandemic worsens and hurts demand.<br />U.S. shale producers are also indicating that they are in no rush to increase supply and instead plan to pay off debt and return cash to shareholders. Taken together, the commitments should help the energy industry’s recovery and highlight a recognition among producers that the economic toll caused by the pandemic is far from over, investors and industry executives say. That means there is no need for suppliers to spend on additional output.<br />“I don’t think the world really needs the oil at this point in time, so there’s not a big reason to grow,” said Richard Dealy, president and chief operating officer of Texas oil company Pioneer Natural Resources Co. Despite the recent rise in oil prices, Pioneer still plans to cap oil-production growth at zero to 5% in 2021.</td>

The aircraft began flying again on Dec. 19, after clearing an inspection by the ministry’s Air Transportation Directorate General, it said.<br />Its first flight after the long hiatus didn’t carry passengers and was noncommercial, the ministry said.

      <td>Mac sales boom in quarter that included in-house chip launch, according to IDC and Gartner</td>
      <td>As it turns out, Apple picked a perfect time to mess with the Mac.<br />The consumer-electronics giant launched a new line of the iconic computers with its first in-house processor in mid-November. The company felt strongly enough about the machines to remove the older models using Intel’s chips from its online store. It was no small gamble: Intel’s chips have powered Mac computers since 2006, while Apple’s new in-house processors use the entirely different Arm-based chip architecture that had so far proved unpopular in PC devices.<br />Buyers appeared to snap them up in what is an overall sweet spot for PC sales. According to sales data from market-research firms  Gartner  and IDC released Monday, Mac unit sales hit a record in the fourth quarter, which is also Apple’s fiscal first quarter. IDC estimates sales surged 49% year over year to about 7.3 million units, while Gartner estimates they jumped 31% to about 6.9 million units. Apple stopped disclosing unit sales of its devices at the end of its 2018 fiscal year; the most Mac sales it ever reported before that was 5.7 million units in the quarter ending in September 2015.<br />The pandemic made Apple’s timing especially fortuitous. Workers and students confined to their homes have been buying up PCs in droves across the board. Both IDC and Gartner reported another strong sales jump in the fourth quarter, with IDC estimating a 26% year-over-year increase to 91.6 million units. The three largest PC suppliers—Lenovo, HP and Dell—each saw double-digit gains in the period. Chromebooks have continued to play a strong role thanks to a boom in remote schooling; Gartner estimates Chromebook sales surged 200% year over year to about 11.7 million units in the quarter.<br />The boom from the pandemic is no doubt temporary for most of the mature PC market. Apple’s advantage here is that it still has Macs in its lineup awaiting the upgrade to its in-house processor. Those will include its desktop and pro-level machines, which are expected to be moved to Apple chips over the next year or two. That gives the Mac a good chance to outlive the current PC fever.</td>

      <td>LONDON— AstraZeneca  PLC has applied for emergency-use authorization in Europe of the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with the University of Oxford, a step toward the rollout of more shots across the region as infections and hospitalizations rise.<br />The European Union’s drug regulator said Tuesday it could authorize the vaccine as soon as Jan. 29 after completing a review of clinical-trial data. The European Medicines Agency’s key scientific committee will meet that day after additional analysis of the trial results and safety and manufacturing data. Any recommendation to green light the vaccine would likely be formalized by the European Commission within a day or two.<br />That timeline eventually could add 400 million doses to Europe’s vaccine arsenal as the region battles a deadly winter surge of the virus, exacerbated by the spread of a variant first discovered in the U.K. The EU has preordered 300 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, with an option for 100 million more.<br />Last week, Europe cleared a vaccine developed by  Moderna Inc.  for emergency use, giving the region a second Covid-19 shot. The bloc is struggling to distribute the doses it has, after authorizing a vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and German partner  BioNTech SE  in December.<br />Distribution across 27 member states has been hurt by logistical bottlenecks and challenges with ultracold storage requirements that complicate widespread distribution. Some governments in Europe early on were expecting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to be first to market, leaving them unprepared for the freezer logistics of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, resulting in slow, uneven rollouts.</td>

Samsung recently forecast a 25% jump in quarterly operating profit, aided by a resurgence in phone sales.<br />Not long ago, Huawei seemed on track to meet its oft-touted goal of permanently unseating Samsung. But in the three months ended Sept. 30, its global market share shrank by nearly a quarter from a year earlier to 15% while Samsung’s grew to 23%, according to market researcher Canalys Inc. Lower-cost Chinese operators like  Xiaomi Corp.  and Vivo Electronics Corp. also gained.<br />Those trends persisted during the final months of 2020, industry analysts say, with estimates for a slight retraction in shipments. The overall smartphone market has been struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic’s blows last spring and summer. Analysts say they expect consumer demand to return to pre-pandemic levels this year.</td>

      <td>Investors are showing signs of increasing exuberance, reflecting optimism about a vaccine-fueled global recovery and the changed economics of the post-coronavirus world.<br />The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6% for the first week of 2021, marking its fourth-straight weekly gain despite a mob storming the U.S. Capitol Wednesday and a decline in nonfarm payrolls reported Friday.<br />When economically sensitive sectors and bond yields rise together, it often signals Wall Street is embarking on the classic reflation trade that anticipates a full-fledged economic recovery. It is important because it can herald rising incomes, stronger results at firms from retailing to manufacturing to technology, and further market gains.<br />But the blistering, stimulus-fueled rally over the past year may complicate that formula. While the case for economic recovery appears sound and many fund managers expect the market advance to continue, skeptics say stocks remain vulnerable to fallout from the pandemic, including still-high unemployment and questions about the pace of the vaccine rollout. Supercharged gains in assets from some favored stocks to cryptocurrencies to some commodities could turn out to be unsustainable.<br />Below, some of the best analysis and insight from WSJ writers and columnists, the Dow Jones Newswires team and occasionally beyond, on investing, the wealth-management business and more.</td>

Authorities had imposed similar measures on the provincial capital of Shijiazhuang last week, barring people and vehicles from leaving the city and halting public transportation within the city.</td>

      <td>Europe’s lockdown-support programs risk creating the kind of festering bad-debt problems that damaged its economy after the financial crisis</td>
      <td>A decade ago, Europe’s recovery from the global financial crisis was held back by the lingering bad-debt problems of its banks. History risks repeating itself.<br />The region’s generous lockdown-support programs and patchwork of insolvency laws could create so-called zombie firms—inefficient companies kept alive by cheap debt. Last month, the European Central Bank said this remains a risk.<br />Meanwhile, bank shares have been buoyed by optimism that Covid-19 vaccines will revive the economy and shareholder payouts will resume. The Stoxx Europe 600 banks index is up nearly 30% in the past three months, triple the main index performance and roughly on a par with the U.S. bank benchmark.<br />Following both the global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis, nonviable companies in Europe were kept alive by politicians worried about job losses and lenders hesitant to acknowledge bad debts. The zombies lowered markups, net investment and productivity in their markets as well as inflation in the wider economy, according to a recent report from the Federal Bank of New York—problems that have come back to bite their lenders too.<br />Pandemic support programs, such as loans and bankruptcy moratoria, aspire to give businesses the time needed to secure their finances and pivot operations to better serve pandemic and post-pandemic customers. Sometimes, though, the support simply provides cheap funds that help unsustainable companies limp on. It is very hard for policy makers to get the timing right on these programs: Rolling back too early could hurt viable businesses, but too late can create zombies.</td>

A number still plan to return after their offices reopen, leaving them reluctant to buy homes or sign long-term apartment leases.<br />That situation is creating fresh demand for furnished housing on a short-term basis, a fast-growing niche that many property startups and their venture-capital backers are rushing to fill.<br />One of them is Landing, which runs a network of furnished apartments across the U.S. When it launched in 2019, the Birmingham, Ala., and San Francisco-based company initially planned to operate in about 30 cities last year. Instead, it expanded to 75, largely because demand grew much faster than expected, said Landing Chief Executive Bill Smith.<br />“Covid has taken a decade of change that I was thinking was going to happen between now and 2030 and kind of compressed it into a year,” he said.</td>

The new borrowing drove the total amount of outstanding muni debt above $3.9 trillion for the first time since 2013, according to the Federal Reserve data from the third quarter.<br />The muni issuance boom is unlikely to abate as cash-strapped local governments struggle to make up for ongoing Covid-19-related shortfalls and pay back old debts. Before the pandemic, many city and state governments had already been operating on tight budgets.<br />Despite the increase in availability of muni bonds, investor demand remains strong. Central bank rate cuts have left investors clamoring for yield. Muni bond investments produced steady returns last year in a low-interest rate environment.<br />“There’s no yield anywhere so munis are still attractive on a relative basis,” said Jon Barasch, director of municipal evaluations at financial analytics company ICE Data Services.</td>

Economists note employers offering in-person services, such as restaurants and hair salons, are facing renewed restrictions and weaker demand.<br />Further, some employers in higher-wage sectors like software development and finance are holding back on posting new jobs due to an uncertain outlook, Mr. Bunker said.<br />“They are still thinking about what’s going to happen in the medium term or long term for economic growth,” he said.</td>

The new perimeter will add another layer to the secure areas typically in place for inaugural ceremonies at the Capitol.<br />Those talks came as federal officials decided to begin coordinating security steps sooner than they had planned and the National Guard announced it would bolster its presence in Washington ahead of the inauguration.</td>

However, U.S. intelligence warned that Russia was engaged in trying to undermine Mr. Biden’s candidacy.<br />The Treasury said Monday that Mr. Derkach has been an active Russian agent for over a decade with close connections to the Kremlin’s intelligence services. Treasury officials added that since at least 2019 Mr. Derkach and his associates used U.S. media, social media, and “influential U.S. persons” to spread misleading and unsubstantiated allegations.<br />Monday’s action targeted senior Ukrainian parliamentarian Oleksandr Dubinsky and former Ukrainian officials Konstantin Kulyk, Oleksandr Onyshchenko and Andriy Telizhenko, all of whom the Treasury said coordinated with Mr. Derkach in his misinformation campaign.</td>

That was before a mob of the president’s supporters laid siege to the Capitol, leaving five people dead.<br />“Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honor represents and admiration for prior recipients,” Belichick said in a statement. “Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award.”<br />News of the offer to Belichick only emerged Sunday, prompting questions over whether the most accomplished coach in football history would stand by his friend amid the controversy.<br />Although Belichick’s statement did not mention Trump by name, the decision amounts to a sharp rebuke of a president who has faced calls from Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, to be removed from office. His decision comes just days after Trump awarded the medal to Gary Player and Annika Sorenstam, two of the best golfers of all time. Player and Sorenstam have faced criticism for associating with the president in the wake of recent events.</td>

The Department hasn’t had a leader confirmed by the Senate since Kirstjen Nielsen submitted her resignation in April 2019.<br />Mr. Wolf ultimately made the decision to leave, an aide said, because of an arcane law forbidding acting officials to continue to serve in their posts if the White House withdraws their Senate nomination.<br />Mr. Wolf was nominated to serve as Homeland Security secretary in August, but the White House withdrew his nomination last Wednesday in a move it hasn’t since explained. The aide pointed out that Mr. Wolf on Thursday became the first cabinet-level official to call on Mr. Trump by name to condemn the attack on the Capitol building the day earlier.</td>

      <td>He’d help the country and his Presidency by calling off the House.</td>
      <td>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is barreling ahead on a vote to impeach President Trump this week—days before a new President takes office, and with the outcome and timing of a Senate trial uncertain. This is a moment for Joe Biden to establish his leadership by calling off the House impeachers in service of his vow that this is a “time to heal.”<br />We explained Friday why Mr. Trump’s actions last Wednesday were impeachable offenses, and that the best outcome would be his resignation. It appears he won’t resign. But that doesn’t mean impeachment now is wise or good for the country if the goal is get past the Trump era. It may do more harm by letting Mr. Trump play the victim than good by stigmatizing behavior that most Americans already find unacceptable.<br />The first obstacle is timing. In eight days Mr. Trump will be gone from the White House. A House vote this week means no fact-finding or time for a presidential defense. The Senate isn’t scheduled to reconvene until Jan. 19, the day before Mr. Biden is inaugurated. Even if Senators convene earlier, Republicans aren’t likely to hold a trial without giving Mr. Trump a chance to mount a defense, as other impeached officials have been able to do.<br />That leaves a trial to take place when Mr. Trump is no longer President. Views differ on whether the Constitution allows impeachment after a President leaves office, though this would be a first. Alan Dershowitz, the law professor and one of Mr. Trump’s impeachment lawyers in 2019, made a compelling case Sunday that this constitutional point would be part of Mr. Trump’s defense.<br />This assumes Democrats even want a Senate trial and the risk of a potential acquittal. Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat, said Sunday the House might vote to impeach but then wait weeks or months before sending an article to the Senate.</td>

On Monday Mike Madigan, the speaker of the Illinois House for all but two years since 1983, said he will suspend his attempt to seek the 60 votes he needs for another term as the boss.<br />Mr. Madigan said he will wait and see if anyone else can get enough votes after he won only 51 in a Democratic caucus vote on Sunday. State Rep. Ann Williams finished second with 18 votes and another competitor had three. So Mr. Madigan still may keep the job in the end if he can threaten or buy off enough of the dissenters.<br />It’s amazing that he still received 51 votes. Mr. Madigan’s associates have been indicted in a corruption probe in which Commonwealth Edison agreed to pay a $200 million fine for a scheme to curry favor with the speaker. He says he did nothing wrong. He is also chair of the state Democratic Party, which he can use to make or break legislative careers.<br />Since he’s been speaker, the once great Prairie State has seen its credit rating fall from one of the highest to the worst in the country. Its citizens are fleeing for better-run neighbors and low-tax Florida. But even at 78 years old, he has managed to hold on to power like the Chicago ward boss he once was. Mr. Madigan’s political demise won’t save Illinois by itself, but it would be a start.</td>

      <td>Video-sharing site Rumble, citing a Wall Street Journal investigation, alleges Google diverted traffic away from it toward YouTube</td>
      <td>Video-sharing site Rumble Inc. accused Google in a lawsuit of abusing the power of its search engine and mobile operating system to boost its YouTube video service over rivals, the latest allegation of anticompetitive conduct against the  Alphabet Inc.  unit.<br />Toronto-based Rumble, which has become popular among conservative pundits, on Monday filed an antitrust suit in federal court in California arguing that Google is “unfairly rigging its search algorithms” to place YouTube above Rumble in its search results. Rumble said Google’s behavior cost it significant numbers of viewers and advertising dollars.<br />The lawsuit also argues that Google’s deals to pre-install a YouTube app on mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system have unfairly deprived Rumble of viewers.<br />“Google, through its search engine, was able to wrongfully divert massive traffic to YouTube, depriving Rumble of the additional traffic, users, uploads, brand awareness and revenue it would have otherwise received,” the lawsuit states.<br />“We will defend ourselves against these baseless claims,” a Google spokeswoman said.</td>

Chief Executive Stephen Squeri in a memo sent to employees Monday, announcing the company’s decision to suspend PAC donations to more than 100 congressional Republicans who voted to challenge the election results.<br />Dallas-based  AT&T ,  one of the biggest corporate lobbyists, said its federal PAC’s board “decided to suspend contributions to members of Congress who voted to object to the certification of Electoral College votes last week.” It wasn’t immediately clear how long the suspension will last.</td>

      <td>The Justices can rein in an FTC that increasingly exceeds its authority.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration is expected to unleash regulators on business. So it’s good timing that the Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear a case (AMG Capital v. FTC) challenging the Federal Trade Commission’s abuse of its regulatory power.<br />Congress has empowered the FTC to prevent, prohibit and punish “unfair or deceptive” business practices. The Federal Trade Commission Act doesn’t define these terms, so the FTC is supposed to know them when it sees them. The agency increasingly sees them wherever it looks.<br />Consider the case of Scott Tucker, who managed companies that provided short-term loans over the internet that automatically renewed—a common feature of financial products. In 2002 the FTC began investigating Mr. Tucker. Ten years later, with no prior notice of legal violation, the FTC sued him and his businesses.<br />The agency says he engaged in unfair and deceptive practices by not disclosing loan terms with sufficient clarity. The FTC asked the district court to enjoin him and his associates from making these loans and fork over $27 million in restitution, which would go to the U.S. Treasury if “direct redress” to consumers was “impracticable.”<br />Mr. Tucker says this exceeded the FTC’s legal authority, and he has a strong case. In 1973 Congress stipulated that the FTC can seek injunctions for practices that are unfair or deceptive. Congress added in 1975 that the FTC can seek monetary relief, but only when a business has violated a cease-and-desist order or rule-making that expressly prohibits a practice. The FTC must also prove in court that a “reasonable man would have known under the circumstances” that the conduct at issue “was dishonest or fraudulent.”</td>

      <td>Xavier Becerra’s policy on nonprofits is in the dock.</td>
      <td>Xavier Becerra has been nominated to run the Department of Health and Human Services, but his current California office is going to the Supreme Court. The Justices agreed on Friday to hear a pair of lawsuits opposing California’s blanket policy that charities must turn over the names and addresses of their major donors.<br />That information is given to the IRS on a Schedule B form, but it’s sensitive and legally protected from federal disclosure. “No California law or regulation expressly requires charities to file their Schedule Bs with the California Attorney General in renewing their annual registrations,” says the petitioner in Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Becerra. The state began demanding the information in 2010.<br />California pledged to keep it confidential. But in the course of litigating this case, the foundation says that it “discovered 1,778 Schedule Bs that the Attorney General’s Registry had publicly posted online.” One disclosed was “a complete Schedule B for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California,” including “the names and addresses of hundreds of donors.” Whoops.<br />Mr. Becerra and state officials say Schedule Bs are required, and there’s a simple reason they weren’t demanded before 2010: “staffing shortages.” He adds that the donor information is used to detect and investigate fraud, as well as abuse of charitable status. But how is this narrowly tailored as a potential restriction on First Amendment rights?<br />The foundation says, “California lacks any satisfying explanation for why it is not content to send targeted, individualized requests for such information to the handful of charities it actually investigates.” Privacy is vital to freedom of association, as the Supreme Court recognized in 1958, when it held that the state of Alabama could not demand the NAACP’s membership lists.</td>

      <td>Its restoration would advance American interests abroad.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration is expected to shift U.S. foreign policy in ways that could aid the cause I have advocated for many years: rights and freedoms for people in Turkey, my home country. As a modern, prosperous Muslim nation, Turkey was often touted to Middle Eastern autocracies as a role model and a better way. But in only a decade it has become one of them—another autocracy.<br />My call for the U.S. to nudge Turkey in the right direction has brought me death threats, international arrest warrants, kidnapping attempts, and harassment even on U.S. soil. But no matter what happens to me and my family, you can’t put a price tag on freedom.<br />Why should the U.S. help the Turkish people restore their democracy? Not only to do good in the world. It should and can be justified by America’s national interest.<br />A democratic Turkey is more likely to align with the U.S. abroad. Today Ankara looks to Qatar for a financial lifeline and Russia for security. Turkey’s politics scare away investors and make it difficult for the U.S. to sell arms. But half of Turkey’s trade is with Europe, and its credit-driven economy depends on Western investment. The U.S. and NATO have for decades provided Turkey a security umbrella. Alignment with the West makes sense, but Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s regime stands in its way.<br />Meantime, Turkey’s economy teeters, kept upright by the Erdogan government at the expense of regional stability. In exchange for investments from Qatar, Turkey has been doing the Gulf state’s bidding in Libya and Syria and confronting Qatari rivals and U.S. allies, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.</td>

Research firm  Gartner  said PC shipments reached 275 million units in 2020, up 4.8% on the year. Similarly, Canalys pegged the increase at 11% to 297 million units, the highest annual growth since 2010 and the highest shipment volume since 2014.<br />Much of the difference in the tallies from the data providers comes from how each company defines PCs. Hardware makers in recent years have increasingly blurred the lines between personal computers and devices such as tablets.<br />The blockbuster figures come out just as CES, the world’s largest tech show, gets under way—virtually this year because of the pandemic. The annual gathering is often the staging ground for PC makers to unveil their latest models, which could help drive future sales.</td>

The result is more verbal combat and less deliberative thought—all with language we often wouldn’t use while looking someone in the eye. I have been guilty of this recently, and I haven’t always been proud of my language.<br />It reduces the value of communication to statements graded by “likes” or being “ratioed,” and other mechanisms that don’t reflect real human response or quality of thought.</td>

      <td>‘Government contractors will never be agile enough to keep up with germs.’</td>
      <td>From “The Coming Plague,” an April 10, 2007, Journal op-ed by Manhattan Institute fellow Peter Huber, who died Jan. 8 at 68:<br /><br />Germs no longer need to be smarter than our scientists, just faster than our lawyers. Public authorities are ponderous, rigid and slow; the new germs are nimble, flexible and fast. Drug regulators are paralyzed by the knowledge that error is politically lethal; the new germs make genetic error—constant mutation—the key to their survival. Germs use pigs, bacteria and each other as genetic mixing bowls. They discover ways (as one strain of HIV has apparently now done) to use our drugs as food. And they celebrate our Constitution. People as negligent with pills as they are with germs have already helped spawn drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis, by taking enough medicine to kill weaker strains, while leaving hardy mutants alive to take over the business. . . .<br />Pentagon-scale government has trouble enough dealing with car bombers; government contractors will never be agile enough to keep up with germs. What we need is a robust, flexible, innovative, diverse and fragmented portfolio of drug companies, sinking a lot of new capital into highly speculative ventures, almost all of which will lose money, with just one or two ending up waved through by regulators, eagerly paid for by insurers, vindicated every time by judges and juries, lauded in the mass media, and so spectacularly profitable for investors that they crowd in to fund more.<br />It is hard to see how we will get there without a revival of our germ-fearing culture, and it may well take a horrible germ to revive it. How horrible? What might it look like?</td>

      <td>She is notably less moderate (or, if you’d prefer, more progressive) than Joe Biden—a source of strength to voters on the left.</td>
      <td>One consequence of the events of Jan. 6—in which Mike Pence could be said to have protected the Constitution from his own president—should be that American voters will come to pay as fierce attention to the mettle of their prospective vice presidents as they do to that of their presidential candidates.<br />In truth, scrutiny of a kind more exacting than normal has already fallen upon Kamala Harris: the vice president-elect was the running mate of a man who will next week become the oldest president in America’s history. So it isn’t necessarily ill-mannered to ask what sort of successor Ms. Harris would make were her genial but timeworn boss to fail to finish his first term.<br />It is safe to say, after reading “Kamala’s Way,” that Americans who range rightward from the political center will be mighty relieved if Mr. Biden were to enjoy the best of health over the next four years. As Dan Morain makes plain in this detailed and dutiful biography, Ms. Harris is notably less moderate (or, if you’d prefer, more progressive) than Mr. Biden—and so, naturally, a source of strength to voters on the left.<br />Mr. Morain, a veteran newspaperman, covered California’s politics for nearly three decades at the Los Angeles Times and then, for several years, at the Sacramento Bee. “Kamala’s Way” is a story told in a steadfast (and sometimes plodding) chronological sequence. It starts at the time Ms. Harris’s Indian mother and Jamaican father met in Berkeley, Calif., in 1962 and runs through to October 2020, when the book ends, poised a hair’s breadth away from an election that would make Ms. Harris the first woman/African-American/South Asian vice president of the United States.<br />Mr. Morain reveals that neither Ms. Harris nor her family would grant interviews or “provide help in the reporting” of his book, since he wrote it in the middle of the election campaign. But a number of sources with “firsthand knowledge” did speak to him. And he has mined material from Ms. Harris’s own autobiography, “The Truths We Hold,” which was published in January 2019 to coincide with the launch of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.</td>

      <td>Whatever political future Donald Trump might have envisioned for himself is now dead. He squandered a good chunk of it in the Georgia runoffs, when he made them all about himself instead of about keeping Republican control over the Senate. But it was finished off by the mob of his own supporters who stormed the Capitol this past Wednesday and inflicted more lasting damage on their man than anything his enemies ever managed.<br />At the moment, Washington is consumed with just how humiliating Mr. Trump’s exit will be—with a second impeachment, with the 25th Amendment invoked, with his resignation. There’s even talk of holding a Senate trial when he’s no longer president.<br />But for anyone who cares about unity and healing, the president’s fate is no longer the primary concern. More important is the future for the half of America that supported him. Because there is an effort to lump the 74 million Americans who voted for Mr. Trump with those who rampaged through the Capitol—thus rendering them unfit for polite society going forward.<br />There’s no denying the reality of the thugs. But let me tell you about the people I know who attended that rally. To a person, they are decent, ordinary Americans who didn’t enter the Capitol and wouldn’t dream of disobeying a police officer.<br />Some (but not all) believe the election was stolen. They’re mistaken, but that doesn’t make them white supremacists, domestic terrorists, religious extremists or  any of the many noxious names they’ve been called. Those I know personally are now terrified that they will be doxed—meaning vengeful leftists will make their personal information public—and perhaps fired from their jobs if it gets out they were in Washington for the rally.</td>

      <td>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s announcement last week that he’s lifting restrictions on meetings between U.S. and Taiwanese officials will enrage Beijing, but the impact on Taiwan’s security is harder to judge.<br />Taiwan has divided America from China since Chiang Kai-shek’s defeated Kuomintang fled to the roughly Maryland-sized island about 100 miles from the Chinese mainland back in 1949. Ever since Henry Kissinger’s groundbreaking diplomacy in the early 1970s, Washington has embraced a one-China policy. The U.S. rejects the use of force to resolve the Taiwan issue, but under the policy of “strategic ambiguity,” America declines to say what it would do if Beijing attempted forceful reunification.<br />President-elect Biden, unfortunately, inherits a situation in which the basis of the old compromise is coming apart. For its part, China has launched one of the greatest military buildups in the history of the world across the straits from Taiwan. Coupled with the artificial islands and military buildup in the South China Sea, it’s clear Beijing has been systematically seeking to create the conditions for a successful invasion of Taiwan.<br />China is closer to this goal than many Americans realize. Twenty years ago, Beijing had no prospect of conquering the island. The Chinese Communist Party could bluster about reunification all it wanted, but the Taiwanese, the Japanese and the mainlanders themselves understood that this was empty talk.<br />It gets less empty every day. Increasingly the military balance has shifted from a clear U.S. advantage into a gray zone as China’s buildup accelerates. This is anything but a secret; the gradual decline of America’s ability to forestall an invasion of Taiwan is well understood by governments around the Pacific.</td>

      <td>British band Shame’s evocative lyrics and propulsive beats stand out in London’s crowded, post-punk scene.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />Rock music may be on the wane commercially, but England continues to produce young and aggressive young bands who channel the sound and attitude from the glory days of post-punk. In the past few years, South London has been fertile ground for such groups, including Black MIDI, Fat White Family and the five-piece outfit Shame. The last of these formed in 2014 when its members were teenagers and released its debut album, “Songs of Praise,” in 2018. Though the record wasn’t a huge seller, Shame and its surrounding scene generated a fair amount of hype in the British press. The group’s influences are right there on the surface—the forceful grooves of Gang of Four, the bitter, half-spoken vocal rants of the Fall, the cathartic choruses of the Clash—but Shame’s perspective is contemporary, befitting the youth of its members (none has reached 25). The band’s second album, “Drunk Tank Pink” (Dead Oceans), out Friday, intensifies and distills its sound and is its strongest work to date.<br />“Drunk Tank Pink” was completed at least six months ago and was written before the pandemic, but you can’t blame a group like this for trying to hold a record until concerts are possible. Shame has a reputation as a great live band, due in no small part to its rhythm section. Though the guitars, by Eddie Green and Sean Coyle-Smith, are jagged, punishing and occasionally disarmingly melodic, the ear keeps returning to the forward thrust of Josh Finerty’s bass and Charlie Forbes’s drums. The record’s producer, James Ford, once made electronic dance music as part of Simian Mobile Disco, and he has a keen understanding of how a propulsive beat can elevate rock.</td>

      <td>Australian lenders hope no-interest cards can arrest a decline in usage and attract younger customers</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—Interest charges have been one of the defining features of credit cards for decades and so when an employee at a big Australian bank suggested getting rid of them, he was taking a risk.<br />“He said, ‘Well, what about a no-interest credit card?’ ” said Rachel Slade, personal banking group executive at  National Australia Bank Ltd. , recalling a feedback session at one of the lender’s Melbourne offices. “And everyone’s like, ‘What? That’s not how a credit card works.’ ”<br />Worried about dwindling credit-card usage during the coronavirus pandemic and the rapid rise of startups like Australia’s  Afterpay Ltd.  and Sweden’s Klarna Bank AB that allow consumers to pay for goods in installments, some banks are rethinking what has been one of their most lucrative businesses.<br />National Australia Bank, known locally as NAB, launched a no-interest credit card in September. Users get a fixed line of credit and the bank levies a monthly fee, which is refunded if the customer maintains a zero balance and doesn’t use the card.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia ,  the country’s largest lender by market value, also unveiled a no-interest card last year.<br />The experiment isn’t being replicated in the U.S. where most credit-card issuers charge interest when cardholders carry balances. But if they prove to be successful, Australian banks’ no-interest cards could drive change in other markets.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats said they plan to vote on impeaching President Trump on Wednesday, accusing him of inciting supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol, as Congress careened toward a fresh showdown over Mr. Trump’s behavior in the final days of the administration.<br />House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment on Monday morning and said they would move ahead regardless of tepid Republican support. While some Republicans have condemned the president for encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol as lawmakers were voting to ratify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, only a handful have expressed support for removing him from office through impeachment or other means.<br />Democrats would need a majority vote in the House to impeach the president, and a two-thirds supermajority in the Senate to convict. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has said there would be no time to conduct a trial and vote in the Senate before Inauguration Day, likely leaving the matter to the incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).<br />The Senate can hold a trial for Mr. Trump even after his presidency ends, which some lawmakers see as justified in both condemning Mr. Trump’s actions and potentially banning Mr. Trump from running again.<br />“Whether impeachment can pass the United States Senate is not the issue,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.). “The issue is, we have a president who most of us believe participated in encouraging an insurrection and attack on this building and on democracy.”</td>

      <td>The House could impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection, and a Senate trial could take place after he leaves office—or be delayed indefinitely</td>
      <td>The House of Representatives is preparing to impeach President Trump for a second time, just over a year after it first impeached him for pressing Ukraine to announce investigations that would have aided him politically. Here’s how the unprecedented process could play out.<br />The Constitution gives broad leeway to the House of Representatives to handle the impeachment process. There are no limits on the number of times someone may be impeached, though Mr. Trump would be the first person ever to be impeached more than once.<br />Because President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration is so soon, the practical effects of a second impeachment by the House would mostly be symbolic and dependent upon what the Senate decides to do. The Senate is currently adjourned and cannot reconvene until Jan. 19 unless it has the unanimous consent of all 100 members—something that is extremely unlikely to happen. That means that an impeachment trial, if the House sends over an article, can’t begin until Trump’s last full day in office at the earliest.<br />If the Senate proceeds to a trial and successfully convicts Mr. Trump, he couldn’t be removed from an office he didn’t hold. But the Senate could immediately hold a follow-up vote, subject only to a simple majority, to ban Mr. Trump—who has weighed another presidential run in 2024—from ever seeking office again. Those are the only punishments the Senate can consider as part of an impeachment conviction.<br />Yes. In fact, the precedent for holding articles of impeachment in the House after they are approved is just over a year old. During Mr. Trump’s first impeachment, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) waited several weeks to send over articles to the Senate while she and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fought over trial rules.</td>

The firm wasn’t interested in receiving a lone seat or becoming “an isolated stockholder advocate” on the board, according to the letter.

Restaurant chains, supermarket operators and food distributors have accused chicken companies of coordinating production and pricing to boost prices for staples like chicken breasts, tenders and wings.<br />Last year the U.S. Department of Justice filed criminal price-fixing and bid-rigging charges against 10 poultry-industry executives, including two former chief executives of Pilgrim’s. The defendants have pleaded not guilty.<br />Colorado-based Pilgrim’s said Monday that the civil settlement remains subject to court approval, and that the company isn’t admitting to the chicken buyers’ claims. Lawsuits filed individually by major supermarket and restaurant chains remain outstanding, the company said.<br />Pilgrim’s and other U.S. chicken suppliers face ongoing lawsuits from some of their top customers, including chicken sandwich giant Chick-fil-A Inc., supermarket operators  Walmart Inc.  and  Kroger Co. , and food-service distributors  Sysco Corp.  and  US Foods Holding Corp.</td>

The conservative social network founded in 2018 exploded in popularity among supporters of President Trump after the November U.S. election.<br />“AWS’s decision to effectively terminate Parler’s account is apparently motivated by political animus.

The company said while it would no longer provide web services to Parler after Sunday at 11:59 p.m. Pacific time, it would preserve the platform’s data and help it migrate to different servers.<br />In its complaint, Parler also accused Amazon of applying a double standard than with other platforms, noting that Twitter had recently signed a multi-year web-hosting deal with the company.</td>

Daniel R. Hokanson, who is in charge of the National Guard Bureau, said in a press briefing Monday that the troop levels could rise to 15,000. He didn’t specify which states the Guard members would come from, whether they would be armed or the details of their mission.<br />The planned deployments represent an increase from the roughly 6,200 troops who arrived from six states in response to a pro-Trump mob’s violent attack on the Capitol Wednesday after the president urged his supporters to march on the legislature while lawmakers were meeting there to certify electoral votes. The bolstered force would be larger than contingents of Guardsmen at past inaugurations. Roughly 9,000 were in Washington for President Obama’s inauguration, Gen. Hokanson said.<br />The decision to deploy more Guard personnel came after military planners and local law enforcement evaluated their planned security posture and discussed how many more troops could be useful.<br />After Wednesday’s deadly assault on the Capitol, Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller formally approved deploying 6,200 Guardsmen from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and Maryland. The first of those arrived Thursday morning and are currently securing the perimeter around the Capitol and conducting other logistical support.</td>

      <td>Jason Furman recapped “The Policy Lessons of the ‘Trump Economy’” (op-ed, Dec. 30) in a generally nonpartisan manner. Presidents are often at the mercy of uncontrollable events and the business cycle and an assessment of long-term results of a president’s policies based on shorter-term marginal benefits or detriments is dicey, at best. Mr. Furman’s summary of the difficulties in measuring a president’s policy results is welcome, although one doesn’t recall him saying during his time as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers that it was premature to give President’s Obama’s policies too much credit for an extended (but not very robust) recovery.<br />Joe Biden arguably gets the best of all policy-measurement worlds when he enters the White House. If the pandemic’s effects drag on, lockdowns take a new toll and the economy stalls or double dips into recession, Mr. Trump owns the downside. If the economy continues to recover, Mr. Biden clearly owns the 2021 upside, especially if he and the Democrats can advance another large stimulus package. A strong economic recovery based on effective vaccines and pent-up demand will be attributed to Mr. Biden’s policies, regardless of any more relevant measurement of long-term results.<br />A long-term perspective regarding economic polices is appropriate, but how can that happen when most media scorekeepers are partisans and campaigning for 2022 House and Senate races will begin in a few months?<br />Jeff Adams<br />Atlanta</td>

We’ve graduated more than 1,000 students from the program with a 97% student satisfaction rate. Although nearly all of our students are employed, more than half of them received a promotion or a new job opportunity during their time in our program.<br />We’ve embraced disruptive innovation in a sector that has traditionally been resistant, and the market has responded with enthusiasm—so much so, that we’ve expanded our online programs to include a master’s degree in accounting and another in management.<br />Employers still desire the skills provided by a high-quality M.B.A. education. By increasing access to the degree by lowering financial, geographic and other barriers, we have once again made the M.B.A. a high-value investment.<br />Jeffrey Brown</td>

He suggests that the best way to celebrate diversity is to begin by celebrating “diversity of thought,” which can stem from “the value of true merit, or the real abilities of the people chosen to perform their jobs.”<br />What seems amiss here is that Mr. Epstein seems to insinuate that the race, color and gender type of diversity happens often as a trade-off to merit and accomplishment. But as made obvious by the résumés of President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet picks, to think that a candidate is picked for a job based on a race, color or gender factor alone is an outdated notion. Merit is the sine qua non in these competitive times. If anything, race, color and gender just add to enriching the diversity of thought.<br />Heidi H. Cha<br />New York<br /></td>

The Dearborn, Mich.-based auto maker will continue to sell vehicles in Brazil and other South American markets with cars made at its remaining factories in Argentina and Uruguay, as well as other regions.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic has worsened an already tough environment in South America, which has gone through years of economic turmoil and currency fluctuations that have sapped profits for global auto makers. Ford’s factory footprint became too costly to support given the persistently difficult sales environment, a spokesman said.<br />Ford said it would take $4.1 billion in charges related to the restructuring, including $2.5 billion in cash charges. The charges will be divided between the fourth quarter of 2020 and this year.<br />Ford has struggled in overseas markets in recent years while leaning on its North American business and in-house lending arm to fuel profits. Through the first three quarters of 2020, Ford lost money in each of its regional businesses, South America, Europe and China.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Trump administration is putting Cuba back on the list of countries that are considered to be state sponsors of terrorism, a senior U.S. official said, rescinding a 2015 move by the Obama administration to thaw ties to the onetime Cold War adversary.<br />The redesignation, which will be announced Monday, may complicate President-elect Joe Biden’s efforts to improve ties with Havana. It is the latest in a series of foreign policy steps the administration has taken in recent days to try to lock in policies before it leaves office.<br />The State Department list to which Cuba is being added includes Syria, Iran and North Korea. Cuba was removed from that list in 2015 as the Obama administration sought to build ties with the country, part of a campaign that included boosting commercial air travel, the reopening of embassies and a visit by President Obama to the country.<br />Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to argue that the move is justified because Cuba has given refuge to an American convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in 1973 and to cite other complaints against the Cuban government.<br />A formal administration statement explaining the decision is expected to be issued later on Monday.</td>
