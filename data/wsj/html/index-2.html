On Thursday evening, a number of lawmakers from both parties spoke out in  Twitter  posts after reports that Guard members were asked to take rest breaks in a parking garage instead of indoor space.<br />Reports that Guardsmen were working and moving in tight quarters raised concerns Covid-19 protocols can’t be maintained, a defense official said.<br />Every Guardsman deployed to Washington was screened for Covid-19 before arriving, but not all were tested, unless required under the screening process, defense officials said.</td>

      <td>United Wholesale Mortgage made its public trading debut Friday, the largest-ever listing through a special-purpose-acquisition company.<br />Gores Holdings IV Inc.  shareholders this week approved a merger with the company, now called  UWM Holdings Corp. , in a deal to take it public at a valuation close to $16 billion. It marks a record for SPAC deals, which have become all the rage on Wall Street, according to data provider SPACInsider.<br />The Michigan-based mortgage company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol UWMC, closed at $11.35 on Friday, slightly below Gores Holdings’ closing price of $11.54 on Thursday.<br />SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, put a reverse spin on the conventional model for public offerings because they raise money before developing a business. They use the funds to make an acquisition that turns the target into a public company. Once the blank-check company merges with a target company, as Gores Holdings and UWM did Thursday, that company gets the SPAC’s spot on a stock exchange, enabling it to sell shares to the public.<br />UWM works with independent brokers around the country to underwrite and service mortgages. It is one of a number of nonbank mortgage companies embracing the public markets at a booming time for the U.S. housing market. Low interest rates helped push mortgage originations to record levels in 2020. UWM was the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. in the first three quarters of 2020, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance.</td>

Yet some of Mr. Biden’s early moves could create conflict with business groups and their congressional allies.<br />Mr. Biden has called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and has picked Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former union leader with close ties to organized labor, for Labor Department secretary.<br />The president on Friday signed executive orders including provisions that would restore collective bargaining power for federal workers, among other labor-focused measures. On the campaign trail, he said he would create a cabinet-level group to focus on promoting union organizing and collective bargaining.<br />Mr. Biden backs passage of legislation sought by labor groups to increase union membership and boost employee protections. The bill would weaken state-level right-to-work laws, which prohibit unions from compelling membership as a condition of employment, and block firms from replacing striking workers, among other measures. Congressional aides say lawmakers will introduce the bill, called the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, again in the current session of Congress.</td>

Greg Abbott and Ken Cuccinelli, then acting deputy secretary of homeland security, says it establishes a binding and enforceable commitment between DHS and Texas, in which DHS would “consult with Texas before taking any action or making any decision that could reduce immigration enforcement, increase the number of removable or inadmissible aliens in the United States, or increase immigration benefits or eligibility for benefits for removable or inadmissible aliens.”</td>

      <td>DIA says it buys commercially available geolocation data and has used it five times in recent years for authorized investigations</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—In a new document made public Friday, the nation’s top military intelligence agency acknowledged monitoring the location of U.S.-based mobile devices without a warrant through location data drawn from ordinary smartphone apps.<br />The Defense Intelligence Agency told congressional investigators that the agency has access to “commercially available geolocation metadata aggregated from smartphones” from both the U.S. and abroad. It said it had queried its database to look at the location information of U.S.-based smartphones five times in the last 2½ years as part of authorized investigations.<br />Such data is typically drawn from smartphone apps such as weather, games and other apps that get user permission to access a phone’s GPS location. A robust commercial market exists for such data for advertising and other commercial purposes. The Wall Street Journal first revealed last year that numerous U.S. government agencies were also buying access to that data from commercial brokers without a warrant, raising questions about whether those agencies were adequately safeguarding the privacy and civil liberties of Americans.<br />The ability of U.S. intelligence agencies to access data on Americans for intelligence purposes is typically circumscribed. A warrant from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is required for most kinds of surveillance. However, the Defense Intelligence Agency told Congress that it didn’t believe it needed any sort of court authorization to acquire commercial data for foreign intelligence or national security purposes.<br />That echoes a position taken by numerous other U.S. government agencies in recent years as the amount of data on individuals using computers, smartphones and tablets has exploded. The Department of Homeland Security is buying a similar data product and is using it for warrantless tracking as part of its border security and immigration mission. The Internal Revenue Service also purchased access to cellphone data as part of its law enforcement mission. All claim because the data is purchased on the open market, no court order is required.</td>

      <td>Ultralow interest rates and remote work during the coronavirus pandemic spurred demand</td>
      <td>U.S. home sales in 2020 surged to their highest level in 14 years, fueled by ultralow interest rates and a pandemic that sent buyers scrambling for more spacious homes to accommodate remote work.<br />Robust home sales in the second half of the year surprised many economists while offering a rare bright spot for an economy run aground by closed businesses and mounting job losses during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Pandemic-driven job losses were concentrated in lower-paying industries, while households with higher pay and the resources to buy a new home weathered the downturn better. The pandemic prompted many of them to leave big cities for suburbs or smaller towns, while record-low borrowing rates made the decision to trade up easier. Once shelter-in-place restrictions eased, sales took off in June and have rarely flagged since then.<br />“It’s totally because of the pandemic,” said Brittany McCreary, who with her husband last month bought their first home, a four-bedroom stone farmhouse, in York, Pa., after leaving the Chicago area. “We’re glad we’re not renting anymore. We always wanted to buy.”<br />Existing-home sales rose 0.7% in December from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. The December sales marked a 22% increase from a year earlier.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden has directed the intelligence community to assess the threat of domestic extremism and develop ways to identify and counter networks that promote it, the White House said Friday.<br />“The Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol and the tragic deaths and destruction that occurred underscored what we have long known: The rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national threat,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. “The Biden administration will confront this threat with the necessary resources and resolve.”<br />A comprehensive threat assessment will be made by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, coordinated with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security and can draw on nongovernmental organizations, Ms. Psaki said. The National Security Council has also been directed to develop ways to identify threats, share information and disrupt networks, she said, adding that free-speech rights would be respected.<br />In announcing the initiative, Ms. Psaki mentioned the Capitol riot and not other specific instances after nearly a year of unrest in cities across America. Republicans have been critical of Mr. Biden for what they contend was a belated condemnation of unrest over the summer involving left-wing activists in Portland, Ore., and Seattle who targeted federal buildings—violence that was reprised in those cities on Inauguration Day.<br />In a subsequent exchange with The Wall Street Journal, Ms. Psaki said the president opposes such violence in all forms.</td>

      <td>Output cuts and economic recovery in China were powering a rebound, but many traders are looking for increased consumption</td>
      <td>Oil prices fell Friday, dragged lower by growing worries that the pandemic will spur greater restrictions on travel and economic activity.<br />U.S. crude prices dropped 1.6% to $52.27 a barrel, ending lower for a  second consecutive session. Oil has stayed in a tight trading range recently as investors weigh worries about crumbling consumption against large supply reductions.<br />Prices have increased steadily since the beginning of the year, with the U.S. benchmark passing $50 a barrel last month for the first time since early last year. That was when a production fight between major producers flooded global markets just as the pandemic’s first round of shutdowns sent consumption plunging. An oil glut threatened to overwhelm storage, sending prices below $0 for the first time.<br />Signs that major producers intend to continue output cuts, as well as a faster-than-expected economic recovery in China, have since powered a rebound. Many traders now say further gains require an acceleration in demand from increased travel and a broader reopening.<br />Denting those hopes in recent sessions: the slow rollout of vaccines and warnings of ongoing pandemic restrictions. The Biden administration in recent sessions reimposed mask restrictions, warned of a mounting death toll and said it could take months to turn things around.</td>

      <td>President has taken more than two dozen executive actions, prompting cheers from Democrats and frustration from Republicans</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—In his first three days in office, President Biden has taken more than two dozen executive actions designed to reverse Trump administration policies and enact longstanding liberal priorities on protecting the environment, enhancing workers’ protections and increasing the role of government in the economy.<br />The moves have prompted opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who say that they undermine Mr. Biden’s push for bipartisan deal making and national unity, a major theme of his inaugural address. At the same time, while his early policy efforts have been broadly cheered by Democrats, some progressives are urging him to go further, reflecting Mr. Biden’s challenge of balancing pressures from both parties.<br />Since taking office Wednesday, Mr. Biden’s actions have reversed some of former President Donald Trump’s highest-profile policy initiatives by overturning a travel ban on several majority-Muslim and other countries and revoking a permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. They also lay the groundwork for what Mr. Biden says will be his administration’s focus: boosting economic growth, dealing with the pandemic, and increasing government spending on programs designed to assist Americans hard hit by the pandemic-induced recession.<br />“There is plenty of time for President Biden to remember that he does not owe his election to the far left,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) in a speech Thursday. He accused Mr. Biden of contradicting his rhetoric on bipartisanship by catering to a progressive agenda with moves such as revoking the Keystone XL permit and rejoining the Paris climate accord.<br />“The American people stunned the so-called experts with the number of Republicans they sent to the House and the Senate to make sure common-sense conservative values have a powerful say in this government,” Mr. McConnell said. “So our side is ready to share ideas and work with the Biden administration, applying common sense to find common ground for the common good.”</td>

The violent events that day left five people dead.<br />The Democratic impeachment managers are “ready to begin to make their case to 100 Senate jurors through the trial process,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a brief statement Friday. The nine managers, who act as prosecutors in the case, will be led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) gave no guidance on how long the trial would last or whether the Senate could conduct other business as the trial is proceeding.<br />“It will be a full trial, it will be a fair trial,” he said Friday on the Senate floor.</td>

During the Trump administration, the Justice Department tried to target what it says are potentially inappropriate efforts by China to gain access to cutting-edge U.S. scientific research being funded by U.S. taxpayers.<br />Federal prosecutors have brought more than a dozen criminal cases since mid-2019 accusing academics of lying about receiving Chinese government funding or alleging that visiting researchers lied about their affiliation with the Chinese military, some of which have resulted in guilty pleas.<br />The program being discussed could allow investigators to ascertain the scope of foreign money funding U.S. research, and help FBI agents focus on the people they believed posed the greatest national security threats, the people said. But the plan hasn’t yet been implemented, and some prosecutors are concerned that it could undercut existing cases, the people said. Mr. Demers declined to comment.</td>

      <td>Ornately-carved pillars and friezes from a 16th-century South Indian temple bring the stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata to life.</td>
      <td>Stepping into the South Asian galleries of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (which reopened on Jan. 8 after being closed due to Covid-19), we walk between two large figures that artists in South India carved around 1560. They don’t immediately register as pillars, so prominently do the sculptures protrude. One portrays a handsome young man sitting under a tree looking rather pleased with himself. He is Rama, god and hero of the Ramayana epic, flanked by his wife, Sita, and the ever-loyal monkey king, Hanuman, carved in relief on either side of the monolithic pillar. Opposite him stands a bearded man with the haunches of a beast, leaning forward, club raised to do battle. Yet this “man-beast,” or Purushamirukam, feels more theatrical than menacing with his mound of neatly coiffed hair, delicately arched eyebrows, and loads of jewelry. He isn’t about to attack; he’s enacting a story.<br />This feeling of performance intensifies as we take in the pillared temple hall—or mandapa—that fills the rest of the gallery. Rows of slender columns demarcate three sides of a rectangle within which 10 more life-size figures, bejeweled from headdress to anklet, face one another across a broad space. Above them, lions look down from the capitals and a partial frieze of reliefs illustrates scenes from the Ramayana while, on the slender columns and the sides and backs of the figural pillars, a plethora of mostly smaller reliefs beckon. They include baby Krishna dancing with delight, a ball of butter cupped in each hand; an architect-priest with his measuring stick; musicians, dancers, animals; and, twice, a pregnant woman sitting, head resting in her hand. She is likely Sita in a fraught scene from an addendum to the Ramayana. (Photographs and a video on the museum’s website can’t capture the carvings’ impact but provide useful aids.)<br />To 16th-century South Indians, these reliefs and monumental figures conjured verses penned by revered saints and episodes from epics and local folk tales. To gather in a mandapa, then, was to take part in a festival, attend a performance or join a social gathering, all in the company of divine, literary and royal personages. But while the configuration in the museum follows basic conventions for mandapas, it does not replicate a structure that once existed. It can’t. Its 60-plus blocks of carved granite were lying in a pile of rubble when Adeline Pepper Gibson, Philadelphia heiress and lover of art, purchased them from a trustee of the Madana Gopala Swamy Temple in Madurai in 1912.<br />There is no record of when the mandapa was dismantled (most likely to make way for new construction), nor any information about its original configuration. Darielle Mason, the museum’s curator for South Asian and Himalayan art, knows there was “a logic to each element” and thought-out relationships among figures, but holds little hope of ever re-creating what an architect-priest was thinking centuries ago. Her research has, however, convinced her that almost everything Pepper purchased was part of a single mandapa; that it was probably open on at least three sides, as suggested by the gallery’s sky blue walls; and that Rama and Purushamirukam belong with the others who stand in the center, inviting us to come close.<br />Nothing—no strip along the floor, no pane of glass—gets in the way of our admiring the skill it took to carve into hard granite the delicate ridges of a robe, the smooth swell of a belly, the curl of a lip or each graduated bead of a necklace. There is a sense of incipient movement, whether it is a slightly bent knee or the start of a bow. We recognize Hanuman by the long, sinuous tail; a demigod by a small, sharp fang; and the bird-god Garuda by the broken-off quills and feathers of wings. Two of the figures hold gourds, marking them as sages, and four appear to be saints. Then there is the muscular, mustachioed warrior standing atop diminutive pachyderms who, like Purushamirukam, holds a mace poised midair. He is Bhima of the Mahabharata epic, a man with the strength of 10,000 elephants, emerging from stone into our world like a superhero.</td>

      <td>Oil-and-gas companies seek new routes to market for Canada’s top export</td>
      <td>TORONTO—President Biden’s revocation of a permit for  TC Energy Corp.’s  Keystone XL pipeline is raising pressure on Canada’s energy industry to seek new markets for oil and gas, its top export.<br />Mr. Biden revoked the Keystone XL permit on Wednesday, hours after taking office, effectively shutting down a 12-year, cross-border project that would have carried 830,000 barrels a day from Alberta to Nebraska and eventually to refiners on the Gulf Coast. His executive order, which fulfilled a campaign promise, cited concerns about climate change.<br />Canada, the world’s fourth-largest oil producer, is left with fewer options to get its dense, sticky crude from landlocked oil sands to U.S. refiners. Canada and industry executives are also working to counter claims that tapping oil sands is more damaging to the climate than some other types of oil. They say Canadian producers have lowered carbon emissions by using less coal-fired power and more renewable energy to run their operations, among other steps.<br />Chris Bloomer, president of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, a trade group, said Mr. Biden’s decision didn’t take into account the work the Canadian industry has done to reduce emissions. “Obviously, it’s very disappointing,” he said.<br />Jason Kenney, leader of the province of Alberta, where most of Canada’s oil is produced, wrote a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau requesting that Canada press the U.S. for compensation. Scott Moe, premier of Saskatchewan, said Mr. Trudeau shouldn’t accept the rescinding of the permit. “I’d ask him to be firmer in his tone,” Mr. Moe said in an interview.</td>

Bon voyage!<br />IF YOU’RE the kind of traveler who values small pleasures over spectacular monuments, the Dutch capital of Amsterdam is a place you visit more than once. You get drawn back again and again, to bike along glittering canals, sip tiny beers in charming old “brown cafes,” and just otherwise bask in pleasant vibes. Find a quiet spot away from the crowds, and it can feel like a home away from home.<br />That’s easiest in winter. You’ll miss out on the festive summertime street scene, but with long nights and cold rains chasing the casual tourists away, it’s a snap to find a cozy corner spot at the cafe. And with vaccines slowly rolling out around the world, it might not be too early to plan a trip for next winter.<br />As we dare to fantasize about travel again, here’s some fuel: a virtual tour of Amsterdam via music, food, books, movies and a good stiff drink. We’ve compiled lists of recommendations, and even enlisted a handful of distinguished locals and experts to suggest artifacts and recipes that will bring the city and its history into your home, from Dutch comfort food to a classic read from the city’s most famous former resident.<br />U.S.-born Russell Shorto, author of the celebrated tome “Amsterdam: A History of the World’s Most Liberal City,” earned a Dutch knighthood for strengthening Netherlands-U.S. relations with his writing.

The proposal, made soon after President Xi Jinping congratulated Mr. Biden on his election victory, was through letters by the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, and through conversations with intermediaries.<br />Beijing is planning a different message for Mr. Yang to bring to Washington than it had delivered during the Trump administration, when trade issues were Washington’s priority. Now, with Mr. Biden emphasizing climate change and the pandemic, Mr. Yang plans to also focus on those issues, as well as getting in train an initial meeting between Messrs. Biden and Xi.<br />Chinese officials have asked for the meeting in backchannel outreach, but haven’t made a formal request to the Biden national security team, which is just getting set up in the White House, and other government agencies.<br />One of the people familiar with the discussions said the Chinese have been cautious in engaging with the Biden administration, given the deep divisions between the two nations and Beijing’s wariness of having the offer of a face-to-face meeting rejected.</td>

Reynolds declared:<br />Hear, hear. Distance learning simply doesn’t work for many children, and state data strongly suggests that Iowa’s teaching population is not elderly—the average level of experience is around 14 years.<br />As for Gov. Reynolds, her good sense appears to extend beyond education.

      <td>Disappointing results bring stock back to where it was before the company announced a spin-off meant to boost growth prospects</td>
      <td>IBM  is learning fast that even ambitious weight loss plans don’t always solve everything.<br />The company more formally known as International Business Machines posted disappointing fourth-quarter results late Thursday. Revenue slipped across the company’s business lines, though the most painful miss came in Big Blue’s cloud and cognitive software segment, which saw revenue fall 4.5% year over year to $6.8 billion. That was well below the $7.3 billion Wall Street had been expecting for a key business unit that had been showing steady growth of late. The Dow component’s share price sunk 10% on Friday in its worst post-earnings reaction in at least five years, according to FactSet.<br />Friday’s selloff also takes the stock back to its levels from before the company announced a plan in October to spin off a major part of its services business in order to focus more on growth areas such as cloud computing. That gave a boost to the shares, on the belief that a smaller, more-focused IBM would be able to regain some growth momentum. But that deal isn’t expected to be completed until much later this year, and IBM has yet to share the financial details of what the remaining company will look like. In the meantime, analysts are growing more skeptical about IBM’s promise that it can grow post-spin revenue in the mid-single-digit range. David Vogt of  UBS  called the target “lofty” in a note to clients Friday.<br />At less than 11 times forward earnings, IBM is the cheapest stock among tech companies valued at more than $100 billion, according to FactSet. But valuation alone won’t sell the stock in a market that favors growth prospects above all. IBM’s market value is now below that of  Zoom Video Communications —a company that generates less than 3% of IBM’s revenue. In such a market, it will take more than a radical diet for Big Blue to get back some sizzle.<br />Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</td>

      <td>Collector Christian Levett has filled his Italian palazzo with a world-class assembly of works by female Abstract Expressionists.</td>
      <td>Spread over two floors of a palazzo beside the River Arno in Florence, amid the treasures of the Italian Renaissance, is perhaps the world’s largest private collection of art by modern female abstractionists.<br />Walking down the street you would never know it was there. Even if you knew the name of the collector, former hedge-fund manager Christian Levett, you would have to squint long and hard to find it in the cluster of little brass name plates alongside the palazzo’s massive door. But once across the threshold you are surrounded by paintings by Lee Krasner, Elaine de Kooning, Helen Frankenthaler, Grace Hartigan, Joan Mitchell and other Abstract Expressionists who helped revolutionize art after World War II, turning New York City into the capital of Western culture for the first time.<br />“There might be someone out there who has 10 Joan Mitchells, say. But in terms of breadth—and depth—I think this collection is unrivaled,” says Mr. Levett. It comprises 80 pictures, including 10 Elaine de Koonings and what is arguably Krasner’s most important work, the 1956 painting “Prophecy.” Elsewhere in the apartment are sculptures by Louise Bourgeois, works by Bridget Riley and tapestries by Tracey Emin.<br />Mr. Levett, 50, began his career in finance in 1991 and went on to work for  Goldman Sachs  before founding the commodity hedge fund Clive Capital. He bought his first painting, by the 17th-century Dutch master Egbert van der Poel, in 1996. It cost 100,000 French francs, a little less than $20,000.<br />His interest in art burgeoned along with his ability to buy progressively more important works. He went through what he describes as “different periods of fanaticism”: coins and hand-painted books, Old Masters, antiquities, ancient arms and armor (he sits on the Metropolitan Museum’s visitors’ committee for arms and armor). Many of his antiquities are housed in the Mougins Museum of Classical Art, a four-story museum that Mr. Levett founded in 2009 in a French village near Cannes.</td>

      <td>Investors’ rush into the lowest-rate junk debt has driven yields to record lows, reflecting Wall Street’s thirst for fixed-income returns and increasing confidence that even struggling businesses can survive the pandemic.<br />The yield on an index of triple-C rated corporate bonds settled Thursday at an all-time low of 6.42%, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. That was down from 7.4% entering the year. Yields fall when bond prices rise.<br />Record-low yields for the worst-rated bonds mark a reversal after pandemic shutdowns fueled a selloff in riskier debt less than a year ago. Back then, investors expected many struggling companies to go bankrupt or default. Credit markets froze, driving yields to recent postcrisis peaks, particularly for low-rated firms.<br />Actions by the Federal Reserve, including cutting interest rates and buying billions of dollars worth of bonds, helped fuel a recovery in corporate debt. With interest rates near zero, investors have ventured into riskier assets, including junk-rated corporate bonds, in search of higher yields. That has helped many struggling companies refinance their debt at lower interest rates.<br />Now, the prospect of vaccines and a return to economic normalcy are powering a recovery in the lowest-rated junk debt, a market made up of companies particularly sensitive to the economy’s direction. Triple-C rated corporate bonds have so far returned 2.2% to investors in January, according to Bank of America, outpacing gains on higher-rated corporate bonds and leveraged loans.</td>

      <td>They were right about his character, but his defects were obvious to almost everyone. They were wrong about virtually all else.</td>
      <td>The Trump years had something for almost everyone. Progressives had the satisfaction of righteousness and a justification for daily outrage. What they didn’t have were policy victories, although they might have had a few if they could have refrained, even for a few days, from treating the president as illegitimate. For conservatives, the case was exactly reversed: They had some major policy wins, but at the cost of frequent embarrassment and dismay at the president’s offensive behavior and self-defeating logorrhea.<br />The worst of his conduct took place after the 2020 election and seemed to fulfill progressive commentators’ allegation that Donald Trump was carrying out an “assault on democracy.” Mr. Trump’s refusal to accept defeat, culminating in demands that Vice President Mike Pence overturn a lawful election on no legal authority, occasioned a debacle that may haunt the Republican Party, and the country, for years.<br />Even so, the most salient theme of the past five years was not any challenge to democracy. The great theme of the Trump years, the one historians will note a century from now, was the failure of America’s expert class. The people who were supposed to know what they were talking about, didn’t.<br />The failure began with the country’s top consultants and pollsters. Candidate Trump did almost everything lavishly paid political consultants would have told him, and did tell him, not to do—and he won. The most respected pollsters, meanwhile, predicted a landslide for Hillary Clinton. America’s best and brightest political adepts turned out to know very little about the elections they claim to understand.<br />Also during the 2016 campaign, an assemblage of top-tier academics, intellectuals and journalists warned that Mr. Trump’s candidacy signified a fascist threat. Timothy Snyder, a historian of Nazism at Yale, was among the most strident of these prophets. “Be calm when the unthinkable arrives,” he warned in a  Facebook  post shortly after the election. “When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authorities at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire.” Many experts stuck with the fascism theme after Mr. Trump’s election and throughout his presidency. That these cultured authorities couldn’t tell the difference between a populist protest against elite contempt and a coup carried out by powerful ideologues will go down as one of the great fiascoes of American intellectual history.</td>

      <td>An executive order rigs competition by requiring that biological boys be allowed to compete against girls.</td>
      <td>Amid Inauguration Day talk of shattered glass ceilings, on Wednesday President Biden delivered a body blow to the rights of women and girls: the Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation. On day one, Mr. Biden placed all girls’ sports and women’s safe spaces in the crosshairs of the administrative state.<br />The order declares: “Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the rest room, the locker room, or school sports. . . . All persons should receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation.” The order purports to direct administrative agencies to begin promulgating regulations that would enforce the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision Bostock v. Clayton County. In fact, it goes much further.<br />In Bostock, the justices held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited an employer from firing an employee on the basis of homosexuality or “transgender status.” Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for a 6-3 majority, took pains to clarify that the decision was limited to employment and had no bearing on “sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes”—all regulated under Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments. “Under Title VII, too,” the majority added, “we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”<br />The Biden executive order is far more ambitious. Any school that receives federal funding—including nearly every public high school—must either allow biological boys who self-identify as girls onto girls’ sports teams or face administrative action from the Education Department. If this policy were to be broadly adopted in anticipation of the regulations that are no doubt on the way, what would this mean for girls’ and women’s sports?<br />“Finished. Done,” Olympic track-and-field coach Linda Blade told me. “The leadership skills, all the benefits society gets from letting girls have their protected category so that competition can be fair, all the advances of women’s rights—that’s going to be diminished.” Ms. Blade noted that parents of teen girls are generally uninterested in watching their daughters demoralized by the blatant unfairness of a rigged competition.</td>

They claim many black leaders reject the country’s founding principles. Not so. What many modern black leaders do is shine a bright light on the gross hypocrisy of declaring “all men are created equal” while tolerating slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarceration, lynchings and general discrimination both social and governmental throughout our history.<br />The authors state that the radical left has been working to keep blacks in a constant state of agitation. It isn’t the so-called “radical left” that has prompted this agitation but the reality of a long list of incidents of police killings of unarmed African-Americans.<br />Messrs. Woodson and Mitchell also decry the left’s supposed rejection of “bourgeois self-restraint and discipline” and support for “indulging in the passions of the moment.” Some African-Americans who were raised in poverty and an environment of mass incarceration conclude what’s best is living for the moment; this is understandable when many in their community are either dead or in jail before they are 30.

But while his formal designation may be new, it’s built on centuries of linguistic etiquette.<br />“Gentleman” itself dates back to around 1200 in English, originally modeled on the French equivalent, “gentilhomme.” “Gentle” originally meant “belonging to a good, upstanding family,” from Latin “gentilis,” meaning “of the same family or clan.” The title was used for a man in the lower tier of respectability—one whose family was not ranked with the nobility yet was still entitled to a coat of arms.<br />Over time, the “gentility” of the gentleman came to be linked to the chivalrous manners that were expected to go along with his social standing. By the 19th century, “ladies and gentlemen” had become a conventional form of address for an audience of men and women, conveying polite respect regardless of people’s social rank.<br />Exported to the American scene, both “lady” and “gentleman” carried a whiff of their aristocratic background despite the country’s ostensibly egalitarian spirit. The wife of the president was rhetorically elevated to “the first lady of the land” or “the first lady” for short. An 1870 article in the Detroit Free Press laid out the pecking order in Washington society: “We know who is first lady and we know who is second lady—the wives of the President and Vice President have unquestionably these distinctions.”</td>

      <td>With one in four gyms projected to close last year due to the pandemic, Americans began spending big on Pelotons and other digitally connected home-workout equipment. Now some say we’ll never go back.</td>
      <td>WITH THE ONSET of Covid-19, gyms across the country closed their doors. Many of us who habitually hit a spin class or gritted our teeth through circuit training were newly stranded at home, confronting the seeming inevitability of flabbiness. Where were our walls of mirrors? Our post-workout showers that let us hand-pump hair conditioner so liberally? As our scrunchies lay dormant, we even grew wistful for the awkwardness of locker rooms.<br />Now, almost a year later, we’re far less nostalgic. Many have found novel, even superior, digitally connected ways to stay fit at home—and it’s beginning to look like we’ll never return to gyms again. That is, if they’re even still there: Last September, the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association estimated that up to one in four would permanently close by 2020’s end. And a TD Ameritrade survey found that 59% of Americans don’t plan to renew their gym memberships after the pandemic.<br />Meanwhile, we’ve been outfitting our homes with pricey Peloton bikes at such a rate the brand saw profits grow by 100% in 2020 to $1.8 billion. Rival equipment outfitter Nautilus saw its 2020 third-quarter sales jump 151.8% year over year. Even the relatively new Mirror, whose interactive fitness “machine” is a sleek, wall-mounted looking-glass that does not junk up décor, was expected to bring in $100 million in revenue in 2020.<br />The shifting dynamic has triggered new thinking. Kara Liotta, former creative director and trainer at New York-based indoor cycling studio Flywheel Sports, saw the crash of gyms as an opportunity. “My partner and I had always thought about doing our own thing, but I had been too afraid to leave a big company,” she said.<br />In March 2020, they launched KKSweat, a virtual boutique fitness platform offering live and on-demand classes over Zoom. While her former employer, Flywheel, declared bankruptcy in September and closed all 42 of its studios, she and her partner are producing 15 classes a week for more than 500 people. “Eleven months in, and this feels like the new norm,” she said.</td>

      <td>Oil-field services companies show signs of improvement; sentiment-driven selloff could be opportunity to pick up shares on the cheap</td>
      <td>Discipline has been the mantra of American energy companies for a while. Judging from oil-field services companies’ results this week, they are walking the walk, not just talking the talk.<br />Given the recent rally in oil prices, a lingering question is whether drillers will keep up their promise of spending discipline. By the fourth quarter, the U.S. land rig count had recovered sharply from its August 2020 nadir.  Halliburton ,   Baker Hughes  and  Schlumberger  all experienced improvements in North American revenue in the fourth quarter. Notably, Halliburton had a 26% increase in North American revenue in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. A year-over-year comparison, however, makes it clear just how steep the road to recovery will be: Revenue in the region was down 47% compared with a year earlier. Its international segment’s revenue declined by a milder 30% over the same period.<br />The service companies’ recovery might not signal a quick uptick in U.S. fracking. All three indicated that they expect customers to add rigs gradually. Halliburton mentioned that it was private and small operators that added the most rigs, with large exploration and production companies and major oil companies moving more slowly. Those larger companies will most likely start adding back rigs in the first half of the year, according to Baker Hughes.<br />The servicers’ actions speak louder than words: None of them plan on meaningfully increasing their capital expenditures in 2021. That is quite remarkable given the fact that they slashed them so dramatically last year after already making sizable cuts in 2019. Halliburton and Schlumberger reduced their capital expenditures by 50% and 35%, respectively, last year.<br />The caution seems prudent. Oil producers will try to get by with fewer services, for example, and consolidation is under way in the oil patch. The Biden administration cast an additional shadow on the industry Thursday when it announced a temporary ban on new oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal lands.</td>

He also will use the act to boost supplies such as “low dead space” syringes, which can be used to squeeze more doses out of vaccine vials.<br />Mr. Biden, inaugurated Wednesday, has set a plan to administer 100 million vaccine doses in the first 100 days of his presidency.<br />The goal of invoking the DPA is to ensure all available vaccines are being used and administered quicker, an administration official said. The administration is working to help increase supplies such as syringes, the official said, and trying to get ahead of problems it anticipates with hard-to-source critical items to prevent future vaccine shortages.<br />The Defense Production Act was enacted during the Korean War to spur domestic industry to shore up the military, and has been amended since to grant powers that can be used in national emergencies.</td>

      <td>Project that sought to provide internet access in hard-to-reach regions winds down over cost concerns</td>
      <td>Google’s parent company is winding down a project that used highflying balloons to provide internet access in hard-to-reach regions of the world, as it retreats from some of the moonshot projects championed by its founders.<br />The project, known as Loon, started in 2011 and had its first public launch in New Zealand in 2013. It sought to connect billions of people in communities where traditional ground-based infrastructure was too expensive or too difficult to install. But Loon, which was overseen by  Alphabet Inc.,  was unable to reduce costs enough to make its business model sustainable, the project’s leader, Alastair Westgarth, wrote in a blog post Thursday.<br />“Developing radical new technology is inherently risky, but that doesn’t make breaking this news any easier,” Mr. Westgarth wrote.<br />Loon’s technology sent gas-filled polyethylene balloons the size of tennis courts into the stratosphere, typically to altitudes of around 60,000 to 75,000 feet. There, onboard communications equipment beamed internet signals back down to earth. The system was able deliver mobile coverage to an area 200 times greater than a typical ground-based cell tower, Mr. Westgarth wrote.<br />Loon was part of the conglomerate’s “Other Bets” segment, a collection of independent projects that include self-driving car initiative Waymo, life-sciences company Verily, and venture investment arm GV. The segment recorded an operating loss of more than $3.3 billion through the first nine months of 2020, steeper than the nearly $2.8 billion loss recorded in the comparable period a year earlier.</td>

      <td>At 72, the music legend who wrote ‘Fire and Rain’ and ‘Something in the Way She Moves’ reflects fondly on ‘the arrogance of youth’</td>
      <td>It might seem unusual, even presumptuous, for a 72-year-old man to write a memoir covering just the first 21 years of his life, as James Taylor did last year with “Break Shot,” published as an Audible Original audiobook. But Mr. Taylor’s first two decades were extraordinary. He had already lived a privileged but tormented childhood, seen his New York rock ’n’ roll dreams collapse, spent time in a mental institution, been addicted to heroin, recorded with the Beatles, lived in both swinging London and Los Angeles’ Laurel Canyon at its creative peak, and cut a landmark second album, “Sweet Baby James,” that included the classic “Fire and Rain.”<br />“I stopped the story with the release of ‘Sweet Baby James’ because at that point, I become a public person and said everything worth saying,” says Mr. Taylor on the phone from a recent Montana ski trip. “I was on the cover of Time magazine in 1971 and became sort of an open book.”<br />Mr. Taylor has had a seismic cultural impact. His manager says that he has sold 100 million albums. Taylor Swift was named after him, as she announced from the stage of Madison Square Garden in 2011 when Mr. Taylor joined her to sing “Fire and Rain.” In addition to his own songs, Mr. Taylor has excelled as an interpreter, notching hits with covers including Carole King’s “You’ve Got a Friend” and “How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You),” which was written by the Motown team of Lamont Dozier, Brian Holland and Eddie Holland.<br />On his most recent releases, 2020’s “American Standard” and the three-song EP follow-up “Over the Rainbow,” Mr. Taylor’s taste in covers gets more eclectic. He focuses on songs he learned in his childhood, including “Moon River,” “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” and “Surrey With a Fringe on Top” from the musical “Oklahoma!”, mostly performed as guitar duets between Mr. Taylor and the jazz great John Pizzarelli. “American Standard” has been nominated for a Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album—his 19th nomination on his 19th album. He has previously won five.<br />“Early in my career, I found it almost embarrassing to be nominated for Grammys,” says Mr. Taylor. “I was dismissive and arrogant and felt an adversarial relationship with the business side of music, which only wanted massive hits and turned a blind eye toward so much beauty. Now that albums don’t sell like they used to, there’s no longer a king’s ransom involved, and the people left are really dedicated. It feels like more of a team effort, and I appreciate the acknowledgment of all that work.”</td>

      <td>A 20% rise in the price of cobalt since the beginning of this year shows how the rush to build more electric vehicles is stressing global supply chains.<br />Already a shortage of semiconductors is slowing the recovery in auto production. Now cobalt, a blue metal that is needed for many types of batteries including those in EVs, is a concern, according to people in the auto and battery industries and analysts.<br />“The demand is not going to shrink any time soon, while the supply remains tight mainly due to logistics disruptions in South Africa during the pandemic,” said Ying Lu, an analyst at  London-based commodity research firm Roskill.<br />Energy-dense cobalt is used as the stabilizer in batteries. It helps protect the battery’s cathode from corrosion that can lead to a fire.<br />A majority of the world’s cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa. It typically is carried overland to South Africa, shipped out from the port of Durban, South Africa, and processed in China before the material goes to battery makers—meaning the supply chain has several choke points that make it vulnerable to disruption.</td>

      <td>While American democracy struggled to cope with the pandemic, economic crisis and political unrest, Chinese authoritarianism could point to notable successes—and rising international clout.</td>
      <td>In late 2019, a group of international public health experts set out to assess pandemic preparedness around the world. Using criteria such as early virus detection, speed of response and adherence to international health norms, they ranked the U.S. first, China a distant fifty-first.<br />The experience with Covid-19, which swept the world shortly after that ranking was published, suggests that the experts got it backward. Among major countries, the U.S. has one of the highest per capita death tolls, China the lowest. The pandemic continues to spread in the U.S. while it remains mostly under control in China except for localized outbreaks.<br />Covid-19 wasn’t the only area in which China outshone the U.S. in 2020. Its economy managed to grow while the American economy shrank. Its political system grew stronger as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) reasserted control over Hong Kong and China’s unruly private sector. Meanwhile, American democracy took a hit as outgoing President Donald Trump sought to overturn last fall’s election, culminating with a group of his followers violently storming the Capitol. Joe Biden took the oath of office this week behind military-style fortifications guarded by troops.<br />If the U.S. and China are strategic competitors, as both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden maintain, then judging by the last 12 months, China is winning. Its centralized, authoritarian model has been ruthlessly efficient at mobilizing individuals, companies and government to combat Covid-19, face down foreign adversaries and deepen its technological know-how in areas such as semiconductors. U.S. efforts over the past year, by contrast, have been repeatedly undermined by the collision of interests within its pluralistic, decentralized system and among its fellow democracies.<br />The U.S. has successfully adapted to internal and external challenges for over two centuries, and it would be unwise to count it out now. Yet the past year poses uncomfortable questions about whether the American system can meet the challenge of China.</td>

      <td>Robert Gersony’s job was investigating human misery. Not everyone welcomed the truth.</td>
      <td>As a government official, I twice had the good fortune to meet Robert Paul Gersony, whose adventurous and consequential life is the subject of a remarkable biography by Robert Kaplan, his friend of 30 years. Mr. Kaplan, the well-known author of a dozen books about foreign affairs, calls “The Good American” his “most important and ambitious work,” an inspiring story of “America in the wider world.”<br />For four decades, working mostly as a consultant on contract, Bob Gersony provided ground truth to U.S. government leaders that saved countless lives—in Southeast Asia, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Bosnia and elsewhere. His story is inspiring because it affirms the possibility that facts, objectively researched and dispassionately presented, can change policy for the better. His work is also the achievement of a man who was apparently “twice-exceptional”—gifted but also suffering from a learning disability.<br />“Throughout my life,” Mr. Gersony says, “I could only remember text through the physical act of typing.” Consequently, he hated formal education and dropped out of high school to join the Army and serve in a casualty-report unit in Vietnam. There he acquired what Mr. Kaplan calls “his belief in the essential wisdom of the common person”—not the thinker or theorist, but the man or woman who knew the world “only from the grassroots level in the most immediate, concrete way.” From that belief he developed a unique way to build trusting relationships with refugees and displaced people, empowering traumatized individuals to tell their painful but revealing stories.<br />In 1984, Mr. Gersony provided the solution to a humanitarian problem that was particularly troubling for me as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Thai pirates had been attacking Vietnamese refugee boats and raping, pillaging and killing the passengers. It was a devastating crisis both because of its scale—on the order of 200,000 to 400,000 refugee deaths over the years—and because these victims were suffering for having been U.S. allies.<br />Supplying the Thais with coast-guard cutters and aircraft to patrol the South China Sea was not a solution, particularly since most of the time these “pirates” were engaged in legitimate commercial fishing; it was difficult to catch them in their opportunistic moments of criminal activity. After interviewing dozens of victimized Vietnamese, Mr. Gersony realized that pursuing “part-time pirates of convenience” was futile; better to concentrate on the hard-core element who bragged about their exploits in the dockside bars. That was a job for the police onshore, not for patrol boats and planes.</td>

      <td>Throughout Bedford’s books, the depth of human tragedy lies just beneath a comedy of manners.</td>
      <td>‘The nightmare fable of our time is a true story,” Sybille Bedford once declared. She would know. Born in Berlin before World War I and living for almost a century in France, Italy, England and, briefly, the United States, she chronicled that nightmare fable in a series of extraordinary and often uncategorizable books: four novels, a two-volume biography of Aldous Huxley, a comparative study of the legal systems in five countries, a book about Mexico and one on the trial of the English doctor whose wealthy patients (mainly female) kept mysteriously dying, though not before writing him into their wills. She also covered the trial of Jack Ruby, the obscenity case against “Lady Chatterley’s Lover,” and the 14-month long prosecution of the guards at Auschwitz—when, that is, not writing about food or wine.<br />The cost of having survived the 20th century weighed on her. “Those who have got off lightly paid perhaps too little (because there never can be enough?),” she wrote. “I feel I am one of those.” Never complacent, she drew on her own experience not because it was what she knew, though there was that, but because she wanted to understand why and how individuals and countries behave brutally, without mercy or justice, and how now and then they can surprise us with compassion or a sense of fair play. Her subject, then, was individual history writ large: her running theme, responsibility. “Nothing happens without consequences” is the epigraph of “Quicksands,” her last book, published in 2005, the year before she died, just shy of her 95th birthday.<br />Drawing on the extensive Bedford archive at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas-Austin, Selina Hastings, acclaimed biographer of Somerset Maugham and Nancy Mitford, fills in many of the blanks that Bedford, basically a reticent person, left even when writing obliquely of herself and a wide circle that included Martha Gellhorn and Thomas Mann. Gracefully written, largely sympathetic and very gossipy, “Sybille Bedford: A Life” takes as its point of departure Bedford’s quip to an interviewer: “I wish I’d written more books and spent less time being in love. It’s very difficult doing both at the same time.”<br />Perhaps, but she did write, often and well. Though afflicted with self-doubt, she was convinced from childhood that being a writer was an exalted profession, one endorsed by her mother, Elisabeth (Lisa) Bernhardt, a writer manquée at the center of all four of Bedford’s novels. From a wealthy Jewish family in Hamburg, the brilliant and by all accounts beautiful Lisa had married the elegant widower Baron Maximilian von Schoenebeck, whom she met in Berlin, in 1910, while recovering from an affair with a married man. Bernhardt and Schoenebeck were mismatched from the start; she was passionate about life and could talk about Dostoevsky at breakfast. Reserved and withdrawn, he was so chivalrous that he tipped his hat to the donkey when they passed. Before Lisa could bolt, as she planned to do, their daughter, Sybille, arrived in 1911; the baron had hoped for a son.<br />Bedford’s parents divorced in 1922. Bedford remained with her lonely father at the schloss Lisa had purchased in the German village of Feldkirch. But war had devastated the region and the German economy was in shambles. Father and daughter managed to survive by planting potatoes and trading apples and cider for bread and candles. Evenings, her father taught Sybille the proper way to draw the cork from the wine bottles still sequestered in the cellar, and played roulette with Sybille on a real wheel. Mornings, he discreetly replaced her cache of coins. But when the baron suddenly died in 1925, Sybille joined her freewheeling, imperious mother in Italy, where she had married young Norberto Marchesani.</td>

      <td>Researching the life of a high-ranking Nazi, the author comes to know the man’s son—ﬁrst amiably, then contentiously.</td>
      <td>In ‘East West Street’ (2016), the British human-rights lawyer Philippe Sands discovered the story of a man who had maintained a lifelong silence about his own story: his maternal grandfather, a Jew who in 1939 was forced to flee to Paris, where he survived the German occupation with false papers. The book interweaves this narrative with an account of the two legal minds who introduced the terms “genocide” and “crimes against humanity” into international law. Each of the three men had come from Galicia, a region at the eastern edge of the Habsburg Empire; each suffered grievous losses of family members at the hands of the province’s Nazi rulers. Less than 3% of Galicia’s prewar Jewish population survived.<br />In “The Ratline,” Mr. Sands again takes a biographical approach to history, relating two life-stories that collide and reverberate to staggering effect—and Galicia is again at the center of the drama. The first tells of the meteoric rise of Otto Wächter, an Austrian lawyer and high-ranking Nazi who governed Galicia during World War II. The second describes Otto’s son, Horst, whom Mr. Sands has come to know personally and who, Mr. Sands writes, remains “unwilling to countenance the idea that Otto Wächter bore any real responsibility for terrible events that occurred on the territory he ruled.”<br />Otto Wächter joined the Nazi Party in 1923, at age 22, and the SS (the Nazis’ elite paramilitary force) in 1932. Several months later he married Charlotte Bleckmann, a steel magnate’s daughter and art student. During their courtship, she gave him a copy of Hitler’s “Mein Kampf,” inscribed: “Through struggle and love, to the finish.”<br />In July 1934, Otto Wächter led a group of Austrian Nazis in a coup attempt that led to the assassination of Engelbert Dollfuss, the Austrian chancellor. Indicted for treason, he fled to Berlin, where he served in the headquarters of the SD, the intelligence service of the SS, working in the same building as Adolf Eichmann. His personnel file praised both his diligence and his “racial characteristics,” describing Otto as “tall, slender, with Nordic appearance.” After the March 1938 Anschluss, joining Austria and Germany, Otto returned to Vienna to purge the Austrian civil service of Jews and “undesirables.” “Otto dismissed or reprimanded at least 16,237 civil servants,” Mr. Sands writes, including some of his former law professors.<br />A month after the outbreak of war in 1939, Austrian Nazi leader Arthur Seyss-Inquart—Otto’s close comrade and Horst’s godfather—recommended Otto Wächter for the governorship of Krakow, one of five districts of newly conquered Poland. As governor, he ordered reprisal shootings of Polish civilians, expelled tens of thousands of Jews from Krakow, and created the city’s ghetto for those who remained. In December 1941, Hans Frank, governor-general of occupied Poland, convened a meeting with senior Nazis, Otto among them, to announce a new policy: “the total elimination of the Jews.” Four days later, Otto wrote to Frank: “It will bring me great joy and proud satisfaction, in the coming year, to work as a loyal follower on your project.”</td>

      <td>Wednesday’s ceremony instantly boosted lesser-known designers like Batsheva Hay who dressed Ella Emhoff and Sergio Hudson who created Michelle Obama’s look, spiking sales and social-media buzz. Here, a guide to these rising stars.</td>
      <td>THE FASHION at Wednesday’s inauguration put American designers front and center, including several emerging American designers—who particularly stand to benefit from the attention. President Joe Biden’s Ralph Lauren suit got respectful reviews, but outfits designed by Sergio Hudson and Alexandra O’Neill, names far less widely known, were singled out for special praise. This level of exposure can make a huge difference, said Ikram Goldman, the Chicago retailer who gravitated to the work of many undersung designers when helping style Michelle Obama during the Obama administration. “These are unknown designers that are being worn by people in the limelight,” she pointed out, “and that combination...makes an impact on a lot of levels.”<br />Chief among them, sales. Batsheva Hay, who designed the high-necked burgundy dress worn by Ella Emhoff—the stepdaughter of Vice President Kamala Harris—said her e-commerce transactions started reaching record highs after the inauguration: “Compared to a regular day, I did at least five times as many sales on my website.” Ms. Hay is seeing unprecedented levels of interest manifest in other ways, too. A photo she posted on Instagram of Ms. Emhoff in her dress garnered more than 12,000 likes, thousands more than her typical posts.<br />Online interest also spiked for the family team behind the ornate, bird-adorned ring worn by poet Amanda Gorman. “We had the most people we’ve ever had on our website yesterday,” said Octavia Giovannini-Torelli, who runs the jewelry line Of Rare Origin with her mother and sister. “We’re responding to every single client who has reached out.” Since Wednesday, their website has featured a banner that reads: “We’re honored (and freaking out) to have a birds-eye-view at this historic Inauguration.”<br />Sergio Hudson, the Los Angeles-based designer who created the plum outfit that Michelle Obama wore at Wednesday’s inauguration and the black cocktail dress that Vice President Harris wore that evening, said his Instagram following multiplied from around 50,000 to over 130,000 in the hours following the inauguration. He says he’s barely had a chance to check sales and web traffic between all the interviews that have resulted.<br />The increased attention is especially welcome after a year that, thanks to the pandemic’s impact, ranks as one of the fashion business’s worst. “It means validity in the industry at a time where I feel like the industry is struggling,” Mr. Hudson said. “The past year has been scary. You’ve wanted to be a designer your entire life and then in one year you’re like, watching the whole industry collapse….This shows people still believe in fashion.”</td>

      <td>Most might not be inoculated until 2022, though Biden administration’s efforts and vaccines in development could quicken pace</td>
      <td>The U.S. has been administering doses of the Covid-19 vaccine since mid-December. As health departments across the country get their vaccination efforts up and running—some more successfully than others—President Biden’s administration is hoping to quicken the process.<br />As of mid-January, there was an average of almost 900,000 people getting their first doses of the vaccine each day. This pace might change, but based on the recent rate, it might take a year—until January 2022—for every American to get at least one shot, according to data analyzed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The projection provides a snapshot at the current trajectory, although it is conceivable that not everyone will receive a vaccine. The projection overstates the current progress because the two vaccines currently approved for emergency use in the U.S.—one made by  Pfizer Inc.  and its partner  BioNTech SE  and the other developed by  Moderna Inc. —require two doses for full vaccination.<br />Since mid-December, more than 14 million people—about 4% of the population—have received at least one dose as of Jan. 20, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />A vaccine from  Johnson & Johnson ,  which could seek U.S. emergency-use authorization as soon as February, only requires a single dose and could shorten the projection. Moreover, the rate of vaccination has been improving, with the first three weeks of the rollout averaging about 216,000 a day.</td>

Still, they reinforce the possibility that vaccine makers and regulators will need to update Covid-19 vaccines as the virus evolves.<br />A fourth study, conducted by scientists at  BioNTech  SE and  Pfizer Inc.  and published by the companies, showed that their vaccine successfully neutralized a variant that was initially detected in the U.K. That study didn’t include the South African strain.<br />The U.K. variant has already spread to many other countries, including the U.S.<br />More than a year into the pandemic, the discovery of new variants that appear to have made the virus more contagious is forcing researchers to adapt their understanding of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. One concern, researchers said, is that the new strains are emerging in countries where a significant percentage of people have already built up an immune response to earlier variants after getting Covid-19.</td>

A record-breaking 31 House Republican women, including two delegates, were sworn in this year. Eight GOP women are now serving in the Senate this year, following the departure of Sen.

The teenage protester declined to comment.<br />Since November, at least 54 people have faced criminal complaints under the lèse-majesté law that prohibits any perceived insult to the Thai monarchy, according to the legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. A number of them have been summoned by police, setting investigations in motion, the group said.<br />Most of them are protesters who have changed Thailand’s political landscape in recent months by defying long-held social taboos and openly questioning the crown’s role and influence. The palace has traditionally held an almost sacred status in Thai society. But many in the new protest movement see the crown as part of the royalist-military elite that, they say, is holding back democratic progress in their country rocked by frequent coups and political turmoil.</td>

      <td>The Treasury selloff is about inflation expectations, not higher ‘real’ yields. Investors may need to adjust their old playbooks.</td>
      <td>Global investors have seized on the idea that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low as inflation rises. But they still need to fully figure out what this means for their portfolios.<br />On Thursday, the S&P 500 set another record. Markets have been emboldened by upbeat earnings, Covid-19 vaccinations and the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion fiscal-stimulus plan. But there is a puzzle: Optimism has also pushed up yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds to 1.1%, from 0.9% at the end of 2020, and investors often fear that this makes equities less attractive. Technology giants are seen as particularly vulnerable to rising rates, yet they are leading the charge once again.<br />An explanation is that inflation-protected Treasurys, or TIPS, haven’t sold off. This means the bond-market gyrations are all about inflation expectations rising well above pre-outbreak levels. In other words, the market is now convinced that, even if the Fed eventually raises rates, it will do so by less than inflation, keeping “real” financial conditions very loose.<br />For now, U.S. inflation remains low due to the pandemic, but is predicted to bounce back strongly. In the past, traders would have expected the Fed to pre-emptively try to cool the economy—in the immortal words of former Chairman William McChesney Martin in 1955, ordering “the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.” Last year, though, officials committed to allowing inflation to run at a higher level for a while before taking action.<br />Various investment strategies have historically outperformed in periods of “reflation” or higher inflation. Buying gold is the most famous inflationary hedge, but has actually only been effective against sudden jumps in consumer prices—not the upward drift that many see as likely now. Stocks are better than bonds when costs rise, but still suffer as companies cannot always raise prices to maintain margins. Retailers, miners and energy firms tend to do better, whereas technology stocks struggle, as do utilities and other so-called bond proxies.</td>

      <td>High infection rates, lockdowns led to a deeper decline in services activity as 2020 began</td>
      <td>The eurozone economy has suffered a weak start to the year, with high coronavirus infection rates and government restrictions increasing the risk of a second recession since the pandemic first struck last year.<br />Fresh Covid-19 outbreaks that authorities have struggled to contain are continuing to weigh on economic activity and have damped expectations for a strong global recovery in the first half, although the start of vaccination campaigns has raised hopes for a stronger rebound in the second.<br />In the early months of the year, a number of large economies face the threat of declining output as restaurants, cinemas and a wider range of businesses that involve close physical proximity are closed or have had their activities severely curtailed.<br />Data firm  IHS Markit  said its composite Purchasing Managers Index, which measures activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, for the eurozone fell to 47.5 in January from 49.1 in December. A reading below 50.0 points to a decline in activity.<br />A similar survey for Japan pointed to a bigger contraction in the services sector, while figures for the U.S. to be released later Friday are expected to point to a slowdown in the services recovery.</td>

      <td>Our wine columnist consults medical experts on the benefits that the comforting ritual of wine drinking can bring</td>
      <td>I’VE SPENT THE past few weeks reading the social-media accounts of friends and acquaintances touting their wineless state during Dry January, aka Dryuary (or even, awkwardly, Drynuary). Some have been taking a few days off alcohol during the week; others are spending an entire month alcohol-free. I haven’t joined them. My plan has been to drink wine in modest amounts with dinner every day in January, just as I do during the other eleven months of the year.<br />These decisions are highly personal, and I know that there are wine lovers for whom a period of abstinence can be a helpful way to manage a beverage that, for some, can lead to dependence and medical issues. You won’t be surprised to learn that a wine columnist isn’t part of a movement to forgo wine for an arbitrary period. I look forward to the comfort and pleasure of drinking wine with my meal every night. It’s a ritual my husband and I both enjoy, and I think there are benefits to maintaining the rituals that give shape to our days, especially during these turbulent times.<br />Dr. Jane Ogden, a professor of health psychology at the University of Surrey in the U.K., has written extensively on women’s health. She agreed there are good reasons to uphold rituals in stressful periods. “I think the most important thing at the moment is self care and being kind to yourself,” she wrote in an email. “If a routine glass of something helps, then that’s fine. It’s the bigger picture which is more important!” Yes, she included an exclamation point, which I took as further approbation of my vinous custom.<br />Dr. Ogden added that she thought Dry January proponents might actually be putting themselves at future risk. They might end up drinking even more in February when they return to “regular” consumption. “We call this the what-the-hell effect, or disinhibition,” she wrote. “Probably best to just drink in moderation all year round so your liver doesn’t need time off and you don’t need to binge.”<br />Keri Glassman, a New York-based nutritionist, registered dietitian and founder of the Nutritious Life Studio, also discussed the significance of our everyday customs. “Rituals can be important for consistency and structure within our days, weeks or months. A healthy ritual can be powerful in terms of maintaining long-term healthy behaviors,” Ms. Glassman noted. Dryuary devotees need to assess their goals—and their reasons for giving up alcohol, she said. “If you are doing it because you really overdid it, you’d better figure out why you overdid it,” she advised. “It’s better to alter your behavior long term.”</td>

      <td>In 2020, underwriters were the kings of Wall Street.<br />The biggest investment banks recorded better-than-expected years, even though a global pandemic sent shockwaves through businesses and households. No business grew more than their operations selling stocks.<br />In the spring, clients bracing for economic trouble turned to stock markets to raise cash. In the latter part of 2020, it was the SPACs—special-purpose acquisition vehicles—that raised billions of dollars as a quick and suddenly popular way to get more companies into the public markets’ wide-open arms.<br />The banks’ fourth-quarter results provide fresh evidence of the equity-underwriting hot streak, raising hopes that SPACs may continue to boost the banks’ results even as the overall economy shows signs of slowing down.<br />A SPAC is a public entity with no business that raises investor funds through an initial public offering. That so-called blank-check company seeks a merger, allowing its new partner to go public without the delays and demands of a traditional IPO. They were a quiet corner of Wall Street for years but surged in popularity in 2020. SPACs raised $82 billion in the U.S. last year, greater than all of the money previously raised, according to Dealogic.</td>

      <td>In the frothy EV sector, companies focused on parcel-delivery vans have a stronger business case than most</td>
      <td>When you think of electric vehicles, you might think first of a Tesla. But a more financially rewarding use of the technology that is upending the automotive industry could be the vans that deliver your online shopping.<br />Until recently, such unassuming vehicles occupied an easily ignored niche within the multitrillion-dollar automotive industry. That is changing fast. This week, privately held Rivian Automotive raised $2.65 billion at a $27.6 billion valuation to fund its rollout of EVs, including a delivery vehicle for e-commerce giant  Amazon.com ,  which holds a stake in the startup. Last week,  General Motors  said it was creating a new company, BrightDrop, to focus on selling EVs to the delivery market. It expects to ship 500 units to its launch partner,  FedEx ,  later this year.<br />Startups are rushing into the space, in some cases armed with cheap capital from an ebullient stock market. California startup  Canoo  went public in December with a plan to focus squarely on so-called last-mile delivery—getting goods to your door. Arrival, a British startup that has received funding and a big order from  United Parcel Service ,  plans to follow suit later this quarter.<br />Electric vans are at the confluence of two big trends. One is the rise of e-commerce at the expense of bricks-and-mortar retail, to which the Covid-19 pandemic has given a boost. E-commerce accounted for 21% of U.S. retail sales last year, a big jump from 15.8% in 2019, according to consulting firm Digital Commerce 360. Vans are shovels in this gold rush.<br />In 2019, U.S. fleet sales of vans rose 19%, their best performance in years, according to research firm J.D. Power. Last year they fell back 21% as florists, pet-grooming businesses and the like delayed purchases during the pandemic. But van sales held up much better than the wider fleet market, thanks to the growth of the delivery business.</td>

But of the $4.7 billion of foreign currency received in cash in the first nine months of 2020, banks were able to place with clients in Mexico or repatriate through U.S. correspondent banks all but $102 million.<br />Proponents of the bill, lawmakers of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s Morena party, said it seeks to benefit Mexicans who receive remittances or tourist dollars in cash but can’t exchange them for pesos or are forced to exchange them at unfavorable rates.</td>

      <td>Capital region likely suffered major financial hit from crowd-less inauguration</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON’S INAUGURAL RESOURCES get repurposed for a crowd-free ceremony in a city on lockdown. The Government Printing Office produced thousands of tickets, invitations, programs—even parking passes. And rather than let them go to waste, they plan on distributing them after the fact as mementos. The materials will be doled out to individual congressional offices, like they would be for a typical inaugural.<br />Hotels that would normally have all their rooms booked with fans of the incoming president are instead filled with around 25,000 National Guard troops, with tour bus companies ferrying them back and forth to the Capitol and downtown. Restaurants that normally have their best week in four years instead closed, after a pandemic-related indoor dining ban was extended due to fears of unrest after the Capitol riot. Some chefs used their excess capacity, funded by donations from around the country, to cook for Guard troops. The eateries later tried to expand their efforts to cook for Capitol maintenance staff, though they were told by the Architect of the Capitol that staff there couldn’t accept food or gift cards, only thank-you notes, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The capital region likely suffered a major financial hit from a crowd-less inauguration. According to an estimate by economist Stephen Fuller for the Washington Business Journal in 2016, the combined economic impact of President Donald Trump’s inauguration plus the Women’s March the following day likely resulted in a $1 billion economic impact of direct and indirect spending, on par with President Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration.<br />DEFEATED CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES have mostly struck out in their bids to join the Biden administration, despite prominent speculation that many would be tapped for posts as consolation prizes for losing their races. Former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones was passed over for attorney general in favor of Judge Merrick Garland, former Iowa Rep. Abby Finkenauer failed to get significant consideration for labor secretary, and former Montana governor and losing 2020 Senate candidate Steve Bullock was passed over for interior secretary.<br />Two lower-tier exceptions: Dr. Cameron Webb, who lost a House race in Virginia, will join Biden’s Covid-19 response team and former Rep. Max Rose, who lost his bid for re-election, will become a special assistant to the defense secretary. And Jaime Harrison, the losing South Carolina Senate candidate, can claim the biggest prize of all non-administration posts as the next leader of the Democratic National Committee.</td>

      <td>The coming IPO of the Tencent-backed company in Hong Kong could be one of the city’s biggest</td>
      <td>TikTok was undoubtedly the most talked about app in 2020, both for its viral popularity and the resulting political troubles. Its largest competitor in China hasn’t received as much scrutiny abroad, but could still make a splash in the market.<br />The coming initial public offering of Tencent-backed Kuaishou—“fast hand” in Chinese—in Hong Kong could be one of the city’s biggest. Founded in 2011 as an app for making GIFs—animated images used in chats—the company is now the second-largest short-video app in China, behind Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, one of the IPO sponsors, value it between $70 billion and $97 billion.<br />Kuaishou has 262 million users spending an average 86 minutes every day on the app. While Douyin was first known for goofy videos with music and dance that drew young people in, Kuaishou began as an app that documented daily lives of ordinary people outside of big cities. These days, more and more users are on both apps, but Kuaishou’s users are still more concentrated in smaller cities.<br />Kuaishou made nearly two-thirds of its revenue from live streaming in the first nine months of 2020: Users buy virtual gifts to give performers as tips. Live streaming was very popular in China a few years ago, but has now been usurped by short videos. Such a shift is prominent in Kuaishou’s financials too: Live streaming accounted for 95% of revenue in 2017.<br />Live streaming’s contribution will likely continue to fall, but what replaces it is more exciting for investors. The company’s advertising revenue, springboarding from the popularity of its short-video app, tripled year-over-year in the first nine months in 2020 and now accounts for around a third of revenue. The ad business also is likely more profitable than live streaming. Kuaishou’s gross profit margin has expanded in the past few years.</td>

And that’s why the president is going to act quickly on these steps.”<br />Mr. Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion economic aid package to help bolster the economic recovery that includes $1,400 stimulus payments, extended jobless benefits, aid for state and local governments and money for a nationwide vaccination program. But his legislative agenda may face early hurdles in a narrowly divided Congress, as Democrats also try to advance Mr. Biden’s nominees and prepare for a second impeachment trial of Mr. Trump.</td>

Last year, Facebook said it would restrict Australian users from sharing news articles on its platforms if the proposal became law.<br />The Australian code would require binding arbitration if publishers and the tech companies can’t reach a deal on compensation. Media companies in Australia, including the local subsidiary of  News Corp ,  owner of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co., have supported that provision, arguing that it would prevent the tech giants from walking away from negotiations.<br />Mel Silva, Google Australia’s managing director, told a parliamentary committee Friday that under the so-called news-media bargaining code, Google would have to pay publishers for links to news articles that appear in search results. That would set an untenable precedent, she said, noting that unrestricted linking between websites is fundamental to how its search engine operates.<br />“If this version of the code were to become law it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,” she said. “That would be a bad outcome not just for us, but for the Australian people, media diversity and small businesses who use Google Search.”</td>

But Mr. Kamensky and some others held out for more. Later in bankruptcy court, they argued it was worth more than Neiman’s owners, Ares Management Corp. and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, were letting on.<br />The owners said in court documents they viewed creditors’ estimates of Mytheresa’s worth as ‘astronomically high’, pointing out the unit had been shopped in 2019 and generated offers of no more than $500 million.</td>

      <td>Chip maker hints at more outsourcing, but expects majority of future chips to be made in-house</td>
      <td>Even Pat Gelsinger can only do so much in a week.<br />The former  Intel Corp.  engineer was named chief executive of the chip-making titan last week. Wall Street roundly cheered the move, believing that a leader with strong technical chops was needed to help Intel finally solve its long-running manufacturing problems. But the announcement came just a week before the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report, in which the company had promised to announce whether it would outsource manufacturing of more future chip designs, likely to rival  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing .<br />Mr. Gelsinger won’t officially start until Feb. 15, but he came on Thursday’s conference call with analysts to give a hint of this thinking. He said he was pleased with the progress the company has made on its 7-nanometer manufacturing process under development. He said he was confident that the majority of Intel’s 2023 products would be made internally, though also that it was likely that Intel would expand its use of outside manufacturing “for certain technologies and products.”<br />In other words, no radical changes seem to be in the offing. That is unsurprising, given Intel’s long history in chip making and the significant challenges that would come from trying to pursue a “fabless” business model. But these vague pronouncements will leave investors guessing for a while more. Intel’s share price jumped more than 6% in the final minutes of trading Thursday, as its earnings report slipped out early. But the stock gave up nearly 5% in after-hours trading following the call.<br />The leadership change also prevented Intel from giving a forecast for the new year, which it typically has in its fourth-quarter report. The company’s results from the fourth quarter—and its projection for the first quarter—show the strong benefits of a booming market for PCs, along with continued weakness on the data center side. Intel promised a fuller outlook for the year and more details about its manufacturing strategy once Mr. Gelsinger has had more time on the job. He won’t be able to spend much of it in the break room.</td>

But Mr. Biden’s dismissals are a break with long precedent at the NLRB and a 180-degree reversal of Democratic views about the CFPB. The good news is that this could trigger a legal challenge to hoary Supreme Court precedents.<br />In 2010 the Democratic Congress created the CFPB as an independent agency whose director could be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance. While on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote both a decision and a dissent arguing this limitation violated the separation of powers. His logic was adopted by the High Court last summer (Seila Law v. CFPB).<br />Cue the liberal indignation. “The Court’s Republican appointees made clear in Seila their distaste for independent agencies,” roared Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse.<br />For the record, Ms. Kraninger supported the President’s blanket removal authority even though it meant a future President could remove her. So it has happened. Ms. Kraninger received a White House email at 12:21 p.m. Wednesday stating: “If you do not resign as of 2 pm today, President Biden will remove you from that office.”</td>

      <td>Democrats won’t agree not to break the 60-vote majority rule.</td>
      <td>Democrats are eager to get rolling on their priorities, and the multi-trillion-dollar question is whether they’ll blow up the Senate legislative filibuster to pass a progressive agenda with 51 votes. This procedural radicalism won’t be the political winner the party imagines.<br />Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell have been working on a deal to share power in a Senate split between 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats. (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties.) During such a divide in 2001, the parties ironed out procedures that, for example, allowed leadership of both parties to move bills deadlocked in committee. This is a good model but it’ll be harder to strike a deal amid current political passions.<br />Mr. McConnell wants Democrats to agree not to end the legislative filibuster as part of the arrangement. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin has said several times he won’t lend the necessary vote to nuke the 60-vote threshold. Mr. McConnell is right to want to address the question before a heated political dispute arises.<br />But Democrats want to keep this hostage so they can threaten to shoot it. The progressive playbook: Wait for an emergency and claim that extraordinary times warrant breaking the filibuster, and hope Mr. Manchin rolls under pressure. Then try to ram through every Democratic priority from a public ObamaCare option to D.C. statehood.<br />The left has recast the filibuster as racist for its 1950s role in delaying progress on civil rights. But a mere four years ago some 61 Senators signed a letter calling to “preserve existing rules, practices, and traditions” in Senate debate, including then Sen. Harris and Democrats Cory Booker (New Jersey); Patrick Leahy (Vermont); Chris Coons (Delaware); Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and many more. The only difference now is that a Democrat is President.</td>

      <td>President Trump has left office, but peace and harmony have not descended upon the land. Left-wing rioters rampaged in the streets of Portland, Ore., and Seattle on Wednesday, no matter Joe Biden’s unity plea.<br />In Portland, rioters smashed the windows of the Democratic Party headquarters and scrawled graffiti on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. Demonstrators carried signs reading “we are ungovernable” and “we don’t want Biden—we want revenge! For police murders, imperialist wars, and fascist massacres.”<br />Portland police say some rioters carried “pepper ball guns, electronic crowd control weapons similar to Tasers, large fireworks, shields and rocks” and that “weapons were seized including Molotov Cocktails, knives, batons, chemical spray and a crowbar.” No doubt mostly peaceful protesters, as CNN likes to describe this sort of thing.<br />In Seattle, protesters burned an American flag outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, and rioters shattered windows at the federal William Kenzo Nakamura courthouse, an AmazonGo store, and the Pike Place  Starbucks .  Some chanted at the police, “We protect people, you protect property,” according to the Seattle Times. Law enforcement arrested three people for property damage, burglary and felony assault.<br />The rioters in both cities identified themselves as anarchists or Antifa members who claimed to be protesting racism, fascism and police brutality. Yet in damaging a federal courthouse and Democratic headquarters, they attacked the judiciary and democratic institutions.</td>

      <td>Alejandro Mayorkas is getting the questions he dodged the last time.</td>
      <td>With the recent attack on the Capitol, Latin American migrants headed to the U.S. border, and other looming threats, the Biden Administration is pushing for quick Senate approval of national-security nominees. On Tuesday Sen. Josh Hawley (R, Mo.) inflicted a small setback by objecting to fast-tracking Mr. Biden’s pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, to a confirmation vote.<br />The Senator says he has concerns about the Biden Administration’s immigration plans, and that Mr. Mayorkas “declined to say he would enforce the laws Congress has already passed to secure the border wall system.” Mr. Mayorkas is also well known as an architect of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that Barack Obama pushed through by executive fiat after he couldn’t get it through Congress.<br />Those pushing for quick approval argue Mr. Mayorkas has been confirmed by the Senate three times over his political career. But as Ohio Republican Rob Portman noted at Tuesday’s confirmation Senate hearing, Mr. Mayorkas was last confirmed in 2013. That was before the release of a scathing Inspector General report in which individuals “throughout the ranks of USCIS” complained that, as director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Mr. Mayorkas had intervened to benefit wealthy and politically connected foreign investors seeking EB-5 visas.<br />These investors were connected to people such as former Clinton associate and future Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and Tony Rodham, Hillary Clinton’s brother. The report further quotes one “high-ranking USCIS official” saying that employees with different views were afraid to speak up in meetings because Mr. Mayorkas would “cut them up, take them apart or put them in their place.”<br />The IG found nothing criminal, and Mr. Mayorkas insists he intervened only to ensure cases were decided correctly. But the report details Mr. Mayorkas’s troubling habit of communicating with applicants and stakeholders outside the normal process—and the “appearance of favoritism and special access” he created. The IG report adds that in each of the three instances investigated, “but for Mr. Mayorkas’ intervention, the matter would have been decided differently.” The IG at the time, Obama appointee John Roth, stands by his findings today.</td>

      <td>After an exhausting four years, a relatively normal inauguration offers hope that better days are ahead.</td>
      <td>So it ended, so it begins. We ought to give ourselves a moment this weekend to take pleasure in the end of a strange, grinding era and rejoice in the continuance of something we had blithely taken for granted: the peaceful transfer of presidential power. That jewel in our crown had been there a long time; we’d neglected the binding wire and setting and it came loose. The aim of the inauguration was to show it is back in place, immovably, as are our institutions, and our 200-year-old way of moving forward in the world.<br />It was all very handsome and well done, a real achievement considering the circumstances: a pandemic, an insurrection in the Capitol two weeks earlier, and what amounted to a military occupation of the streets. The swearings-in took place in what amounted to a militarized ghost town. There is a grim defensiveness in a guarded, boarded-up, fenced-off Capitol Hill and White House. Their relative undefendedness in the past was an assertion: We have nothing to fear from each other. You lose a lot when you lose that.<br />There was no way the planners could produce a happy, moving inauguration with that degree of difficulty. Yet they did. It was a day worthy of a great people.<br />I did not, unlike everyone I know and almost every conservative, find tears in my eyes. I just felt gratitude and relief.<br />What a hunger there is for “normal,” for stately, serene and dignified. For seeing forms maintained.</td>

      <td>Cybercriminals recruit unwitting accomplices to launder cash via electronic transfer.</td>
      <td>Ads that offered the opportunity to “Make $$$ working from home” once were stapled to telephone poles. Today, they’re posted in internet chats, online job boards and social media. They promise big payouts from a few hours of work. The payouts are real, but the work isn’t. The ads seek money launderers, known in the world of cybercrime as “money mules.” The era of the amateur criminal has begun.<br />Big theft is no longer the sole territory of art forgers, safecrackers or even seasoned hackers. In the 2018 film “Ocean’s 8,” a crew of sophisticated criminals plan an elaborate scheme to steal a $150 million diamond necklace from a fundraising gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In real life, last July the U.S. charged Ramon Abbas, a Nigerian Instagrammer known as “Hushpuppi,” with participating in a plot to steal $124 million.<br />Mr. Abbas didn’t have an obvious background in computer technology. He’s not alleged to have hacked computers or stolen data or money. He had none of the “skills” we typically associate with criminal masterminds like those in “Ocean’s 8.” His alleged contribution to the criminal team was to serve as the “cash out” leader. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he recruited and maintained a global network of people with bank accounts to launder money at his direction. He is currently awaiting trial in federal court in California.<br />With rising unemployment during the pandemic, criminal gangs are recruiting vulnerable and desperate workers to open bank accounts, or use their pre-existing accounts, and move cash via electronic transfer. The number of digital money mules is increasing; in early December, Europol and authorities from 26 countries identified more than 4,000 money mules working around the world.<br />Some participate in these schemes knowingly, but many are unwitting—making it hard to distinguish between victim and criminal. Acting as a money mule is illegal, and perpetrators can be prosecuted even if they aren’t aware they are committing a crime, although typically the FBI only issues warnings to those it concludes are unwitting conspirators.</td>

      <td>If reasonable Republicans want to hold off the far left, they will have to stop the rise of the far right.</td>
      <td>We have a new year and a new administration, but America’s crisis hasn’t yet passed. The dangerous forces unleashed over the past five years are still dominant in one major party and are increasingly potent in the other. Reining these dark elements in will take courage and honesty, two characteristics that have been in short supply in Washington. If we fail, the radicals will succeed in using fear and violence to empower each other, crushing the moderates between them.<br />Americans have always been good at pushing ahead without dwelling on the past. This has advantages, such as the risk-taking and tradition-breaking that made the last 100 years the American century. Sometimes, however, unpleasant facts must be confronted.<br />If a reckoning is postponed, American conservatism will continue to regress. To many, the total disintegration of the Republican Party may sound like good news, but they’re wrong. A bloody victory is unlikely to help. If the left refuses to work with moderate conservatives, those remaining moderates will soon be replaced by radicals with whom there can be no compromise.<br />Another renowned American quality, blunt honesty, has been replaced by brash dishonesty. The consensus that most Americans ultimately want the same things—prosperity, freedom, justice—has been broken. The opposition is now routinely treated not as a political rival, but as an enemy of the state. Social media is pushing aside traditional media. The threat of political violence may become normal. The barbarians have overrun both the gatekeepers and the gates.<br />These trends have been personified by Donald Trump. This is the first hard truth conservatives must accept if they wish to come in from the cold and again shape the future of the U.S. and the world. The right must disavow its extremists or be destroyed by them. Republicans—or preferably, in my view, members of a new and truly conservative party—must tame their violent, conspiracy-loving fringe. They can start by proving that it’s the fringe and not the whole carpet.</td>

It was also a year during which we maintained our health, despite living, shopping, working and commuting in the heart of the city with the world’s worst Covid-19 death record. It appeared we were going to skate through the pandemic into the post-pandemic era without getting sick.<br />Then the coughing began.<br />After a long day at work, I went to bed early and kept waking up with a hacking cough. I rose the next morning feeling dizzy and achy with a cold sweat. I called my doctor, who got right to the point: “You probably have Covid; that’s the only thing getting through masks these days.”<br />Since I had a fever, I went directly to NYU Hospital’s emergency Covid ward. Although it was overcrowded, an unexpected calm prevailed. Several of the nurses and aides told me they’d already had Covid. Others had been vaccinated. More important, they said, they now have powerful weapons to use against the virus.<br />The weapon that interested me most was the antibody cocktail by Regeneron that has emerged from this crisis as a giant-killer. Once my test came back positive, I asked the nurses whether I could get the casirivimab and imdevimab drugs that night. They said it’s only given the day after you’re diagnosed. I also learned that despite Operation Warp Speed’s remarkable achievements in bringing drugs like this to the market quickly, there were still regulatory barriers to its distribution that seemed needlessly bureaucratic.</td>

      <td>The “unity” lasted all of a couple of minutes. Then, hours after President Biden pledged in his inaugural address to show “tolerance and humility,” the brass knuckles came out.<br />One duster was aimed at Peter Robb, general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. Within minutes of Mr. Biden’s swearing-in, and as the new president told the nation it needed to “be better,” the new White House delivered Mr. Robb an ultimatum: resign by 5 p.m., or be fired.<br />The general-counsel position is a Senate-confirmed four-year appointment at an independent agency; Mr. Robb had 10 months left in his term. No NLRB general counsel had ever been fired, and the Biden White House provided no cause for the action. Mr. Robb pointed all this out in a return letter and respectfully declined to step down. So Mr. Biden (“we must end this uncivil war”) canned him.<br />For four years, the media and Democrats cast every action of the Trump administration as something law-breaking or verging on a constitutional crisis. This week’s headlines, by contrast, were a mass media celebration of the return to “normalcy.” Mr. Biden ran on, and won on, a promise to restore norms to Washington.<br />The Robb firing illustrates the falsehood of both those narratives. For all Mr. Trump’s bad manners, his administration’s actions were largely by the book. Mr. Trump never fired Richard Griffin, Barack Obama’s NLRB general counsel, who served nine months to the end of his term in 2017. For all the talk of Mr. Biden as the embodiment of gentlemanly politics, Democrats have no intention of playing by the rules. They intend to impose an agenda and won’t let a little thing like a 70-year-old precedent, or embarrassment over double standards, get in their way.</td>

The union, which enlisted area workers at the delivery company last year, made the letter available online.<br />On Tuesday, Instacart said in a blog post it would be winding down in-store operations at some retailers over the coming months as several customers moved to use their own employees but Instacart technology to fulfill orders. The company didn’t say in the post how many workers would lose positions.<br />Instacart is also planning on cutting the positions as it focuses on having workers both fulfill and deliver orders, the letter says. That approach streamlines “the selection and delivery process so that one…contractor simultaneously selects and delivers an order to a customer,” according to the letter.<br />The company now has about 500,000 people who work using that approach, the letter says. Starting in 2018, it began reducing the number of people handling in-store shopping only in several markets around the U.S. and now has fewer than 10,000 in that role, according to the letter.

Advising presidents, he said, “takes different forms depending on what the circumstances at hand are.”<br />Dr. Fauci, whose once-frequent appearances at White House briefings last year tailed off in the final months of the Trump administration, was back in the spotlight Thursday to brief reporters on the new administration’s Covid-19 strategy.<br />In response to a reporter’s question, Dr. Fauci said it was a “liberating feeling” to be working for the new administration, acknowledging that appearing at press briefings with former President Donald Trump was often uncomfortable as Mr. Trump embraced remedies such as use of hydroxychloroquine on limited evidence.</td>

Secretary-General António Guterres restoring U.S. ties with the WHO.<br />Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday that the U.S. will resume regular collaboration with the WHO, fulfill its financial obligations and cease a drawdown of U.S. staff from the agency.<br />The U.S., Dr. Fauci told members of a WHO gathering in a video appearance, will work with other partners “to reform the WHO, to help lead the collective effort to strengthen the international Covid-19 response and address its secondary impacts on people, communities and health systems around the world.”</td>

      <td><br /><br /><br />As everybody with even the slightest interest in the arts knows, the coming of Covid-19 has had a catastrophic effect on creative institutions in every part of America. According to Americans for the Arts, a Washington-based advocacy group, one out of every 10 nonprofit arts organizations in the U.S. reports that they “doubt their ability” to survive the pandemic. And according to the latest survey reported by the same organization, 63% of “artists/creatives” are “fully unemployed” and 95% report “loss of income.”<br />Yes, there is real hope in the new coronavirus vaccines: Dr. Anthony Fauci recently said that if the vaccination program is successful, he believes it will be possible for theaters to reopen with relatively few restrictions in the fall. But there’s still a very long way to go before stage actors and other freelance artists, jazz and pop musicians in particular—not to mention those in associated professions like set design, lighting technology and sound mixing—can start to earn a living again. And that’s just one corner of the arts ecosystem: Museums and galleries, for example, are in similarly dire straits, as well as symphony orchestras, opera companies and dance troupes.</td>

      <td>Some of world’s largest economies are still behind on greenhouse-gas reduction targets, five years after signing the agreement</td>
      <td>President Biden’s move to rejoin the Paris climate accord within hours of his inauguration was welcomed by world leaders, but meeting the U.S.’s commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions promises to be challenging.<br />Mr. Biden has pledged to take significant steps to address what he has described as a climate-change crisis. He proposed to limit power plants’ emissions in the short term and set the industry on the path to becoming carbon free by 2035. On his first day, he took steps to limit the oil-and-gas industry’s methane emissions and he has vowed to boost electric-vehicle adoption by adding 500,000 new charging outlets by 2030.<br />Those actions could face judicial challenges and pushback from industry groups that represent certain fossil-fuel interests. Pursuing his agenda also will require Mr. Biden to obtain, in some cases, congressional approval or changes to tax law. His infrastructure package also could help re-establish the U.S. as a leader on climate initiatives, but enacting this ambitious legislation could be difficult after asking Congress to approve considerable expenditures to fight Covid-19.<br />China and other nations have recently increased their pledges to do more to tackle climate change, and corporations are heavily investing in the technology needed to run the global economy with fewer greenhouse-gas emissions.<br />But global emissions continue to rise, and groups tracking progress question whether many of the countries that have signed the Paris agreement are currently on track to hit the targets they set to reduce their share.</td>

      <td>Democrats in politics and the press agree to pretend the economy is a disaster.</td>
      <td>If readers think this week’s adoring press coverage of President Joe Biden is excessive, they should just wait until next year. Media folk are so eager to prepare for a “Biden recovery” narrative in the future that they are making outlandish claims about the present.<br />This column has previously noted the legion of gloom the president is leading alongside former rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (Socialist, Vt.) to attempt to justify massive federal interventions. Mr. Sanders enjoys making ridiculous comparisons between today’s economy and the Great Depression.<br />Reporters are also eligible to enlist in the legion. “Biden inherits the worst job market of any modern president,” says a Washington Post headline. Postie Eli Rosenberg writes:<br />Sounds like a dire situation indeed, but perhaps less so when one realizes that the unemployment rate was higher during most of the Obama-Biden administration. Around the end of the fifth long year of Mr. Biden’s tenure as vice president, which included his leading role in implementing White House economic “stimulus” programs, the unemployment rate finally fell to that magic number of 6.7%. Unfortunately, during the two Obama-Biden terms the unemployment rate never got close to the Trump-era low of 3.5%, which American workers were enjoying in the pre-Covid days of February 2020.<br />It should also be noted that while misguided virus responses from state and local governments have indeed resulted in 10 million fewer people with jobs than in early 2020, the shutdowns actually killed more than 22 million jobs at their nadir. Since then the rapid recovery of most of the jobs killed by the lockdown is strong evidence that the economy is ready to roar if Mr. Biden’s Democratic colleagues in state government will allow it.</td>

      <td>Former Neiman Marcus owners have sold a stake in the online retailer at a high valuation, but its business model may need a makeover</td>
      <td>Online luxury-fashion retailer Mytheresa, which used to be owned by struggling department store Neiman Marcus, has fetched a high price at its market debut. Although the business seems to tick all the right boxes for investors, not all trends are in its favor.<br />This week, around one-fifth of Mytheresa’s parent company,  MYT Netherlands ,  was sold to investors at a $2.2 billion valuation. Appetite for fashion e-commerce businesses is strong among investors. One week after its initial public offering, Poshmark’s shares are trading about 66% above where they initially priced.<br />Mytheresa shares started trading Thursday at $35.85, and ended their first day at $31, up 19% from the offering price on the New York Stock Exchange.<br />It is a great result for Mytheresa’s owners, private-equity firm Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, after a messy legal spat and Neiman Marcus’s bankruptcy. The department store’s bondholders sued the duo for changing Mytheresa’s place in the failing retailer’s corporate structure in a way that put it out of reach of creditors.<br />Proceeds from the sale will ultimately be used to settle debt the parent company owes as part of the bankruptcy settlement. Although the loans don’t mature until 2025, they carry an expensive 7.5% coupon so it makes sense to retire them early.</td>

      <td>Social-media giant says decision from independent panel would be binding, can’t be overruled by CEO Mark Zuckerberg</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.  has referred its decision to indefinitely suspend the accounts of former President Donald Trump to its outside oversight board, as the company grapples with how to treat one of its highest-profile users after his exit from public office.<br />Earlier this month the social-media giant moved to disable Mr. Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts for at least two weeks, after he encouraged protests of the election results and his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a Jan. 6 attack that left five dead. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the risks of Mr. Trump’s use of the platforms through Inauguration Day were too great.<br />“We believe our decision was necessary and right,” said Nick Clegg, Facebook’s communications and policy chief, in a blog post Thursday, one day after the swearing-in of President Joe Biden. “Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld.”<br />Mr. Trump has condemned the violence but defended his conduct ahead of the riot, which followed a monthslong effort to advance baseless claims of a rigged election. He faces a second impeachment trial in the Senate on a charge of inciting insurrection. Bipartisan political leaders including Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) have said publicly that Mr. Trump provoked the riot through his online and offline rhetoric.<br />Facebook said the former president’s accounts would remain suspended while five members of the 20-person oversight board determine whether certain posts he made before the riot had violated the company’s community standards and values.</td>

      <td>A devastating illness and an unconventional living arrangement push the bounds of friendship in this drama starring Dakota Johnson, Casey Affleck and Jason Segel.</td>
      <td>‘Our Friend” really does celebrate friendship. If that falls short of a bombshell, some explanation is in order. Gabriela Cowperthwaite’s beautiful and affecting drama is also about mortal illness, a terrible cancer that strikes a wife and mother in her prime, and devastates her husband and two young daughters as well. But artistry involves choices, and the abiding emphasis here is as unfashionable and open-hearted as the film’s title. It’s less on the ravages of the disease than on the changes that ensue when the couple’s best friend shows up to help out for two weeks, then stays to become part of the family. (Ticket and streaming info at ourfriendmovie.com.)<br />The stars are Dakota Johnson, Casey Affleck and Jason Segel; all three give flawless performances. Ms. Johnson is Nicole Teague, a buoyant woman who may not have lived up to the ardent prophecy of her boyfriend and, later, husband—“They’re going to say ‘There she is, the greatest living musical theater actress of all time!’” All the same, she enjoyed a modest career in regional theater until motherhood came along. Mr. Affleck is Nicole’s husband, Matt Teague, a journalist who, in real life, was the author of the 2015 Esquire Magazine article that the film was based on. The longtime friend is Dane Faucheux, who, in the adaptation by Brad Ingelsby and in Mr. Segel’s exquisite quicksilver portrayal, turns out to be not only indispensable but a pure soul, a lost soul, an unlikely soulmate of Mary Poppins and one of the most endearing characters to have graced the screen in recent memory.<br />Most of the action is set in and around Fairhope, Ala., a small town that’s home for Nicole, Matt and their kids, Molly (Isabella Kai) and Evie (Violet McGraw). But the narrative hops back and forth between present and past, always displaying time stamps that note how many years it is before or since Nicole’s diagnosis in 2012. The film is too long and its structure can be distracting, but it dramatizes the transformative nature of the event, and, in flashbacks to a happier time, the loving ties that bind Nicole and Matt to the man she’s known since college, and who subsequently became his best friend. (The cinematography, clear-eyed yet calmly lyrical, was done by Joe Anderson.)<br />Dane lives in New Orleans and works as a manager at a small sporting goods store. Wonderfully funny and poignantly charming, yet faintly haunted, he sustains his love life at a simmer and struggles with some sort of existential fear that isn’t specified and doesn’t need to be. We understand, just as Nicole and Matt do, that lack of ambition isn’t Dane’s problem; what he lacks is the belief that he can forge a good life for himself. Until, that is, he intervenes at a moment when his friends’ distress is spiraling out of control, and possibly saves himself in the process. (Mr. Segel is so touching, and Ms. Cowperthwaite’s direction so assured, that I happily embraced the movie’s most contrived sequence, one in which Dane goes on a solitary hike in a borderline-allegorical desert wilderness.)<br />The intimacy of Ms. Johnson’s performance is extraordinary. She is the least assertive of movie stars, yet the courage, despair and fury she finds in Nicole will lift you up and spin you around. Mr. Affleck’s dry precision, his gift for emitting while withholding like some master of Tibetan throat singing, confers a distinctive quality on Matt—a passionate remove that reveals his inability, at least at first, to confront his beloved’s decline. And the elegance of the film’s craftsmanship is all the more remarkable given that the director, Ms. Cowperthwaite, is best known for her 2013 “Blackfish,” a shocking and controversial documentary about captive killer whales at the SeaWorld chain of theme parks.</td>

Fed governor Lael Brainard oversaw the process this time, while in the last cycle it was Jerome Powell, before he was elevated to Fed Chairman in 2018.<br />The process that led to all the regional bank presidents staying on was “rigorous,” Ms. Brainard said in a statement.<br />“The leaders of our reserve banks play a vital role in supporting the economic health of communities across our country,” Ms. Brainard said. “Over the past year alone, this has been apparent in the many ways they have been engaged in the Federal Reserve’s responses to the Covid crisis and the national discussion on systemic inequities,” she said.<br />No officials were fired in this process. Michael Strine, the first vice president of the New York Fed, didn’t participate because of his retirement, which was scheduled for this year. A search to fill his position is ongoing.</td>
