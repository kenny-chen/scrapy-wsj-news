      <td>Standoff in the Persian Gulf marks second in a month and comes as Biden administration pursues talks over Iranian nuclear deal</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A U.S. Navy patrol boat fired warning shots during a confrontation with three Iranian vessels on Monday in the Persian Gulf, officials said, in a second high-risk encounter between U.S. and Iranian naval forces in the past month.<br />The incident on Monday and another in the region on April 2 marked the first in a year involving American warships. They occurred as the Biden administration presses for talks on renewing the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran. Talks began in Vienna earlier this month.<br />In Monday’s standoff, Navy officials said that three small vessels commonly used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, swarmed two American ships operating in international waters in the northern area of the Persian Gulf.<br />The Iranian boats, known as fast attack boats, which U.S. officials said were armed, approached the U.S. Navy patrol ship USS Firebolt and a U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat, the Baranof, officials said. The three Iranian fast attack boats came within 70 yards of both ships, according to officials.<br />Crews of both U.S. ships issued multiple warnings, using radio and loudspeaker devices, but the Iranian vessels continued to maneuver close to both. Finally, the crew of the Firebolt fired warning shots, and the smaller Iranian vessels moved away, officials said.</td>

      <td>First-quarter revenue jumped, but user growth appears to be slowing</td>
      <td>The allure of  Pinterest ’s  platform may be waning with the pandemic where it matters most. How much will its share price fall as a result?<br />On Tuesday, the image-sharing company said first-quarter revenue grew a whopping 78% year-on-year, beating its own guidance and Wall Street’s estimate. But user growth—especially in the U. S.—appears to be slowing. Pinterest said U.S. users, responsible for more than 80% of its overall revenue in the first quarter, increased by just 9% versus a year earlier. That is slightly lower than analysts had forecast and much lower than the more than 12% year-on-year growth the company had averaged over the previous three quarters, according to FactSet. Pinterest shares fell 10% following the report.<br />The company said that, since the second quarter of last year, it has noticed a strong correlation between lockdowns and engagement on its platform. It also said it believed the pandemic likely pulled forward some user growth last year, particularly in the U.S. where its service has been available longer. It isn’t surprising, then, that Pinterest also said that beginning in mid-March, when much of the country started opening back up, U.S. user growth slowed while engagement declined year-on-year. Even more concerning, Pinterest’s guidance implies it could lose some of its U.S. users from the first to the second quarter. Wall Street had been forecasting their ranks to grow over that period.<br />While shares of all major social-media companies have been pandemic winners, those of Pinterest and  Snap ,  Inc. have done particularly well, both up well over 250% over the last 12 months. But Snap’s shares have gained 6% since the company reported its own first quarter results last Thursday after reporting rising engagement as its users step back outside.<br />For Pinterest, engagement now appears to be declining precisely where the company is making money.</td>

      <td>Strong margins and new buyback should click following early pandemic slump</td>
      <td>Google’s business is soaring. Which is a good thing, as the internet giant also seems to be tacitly admitting it will now need to fly solo.<br />For the third consecutive quarter, Google parent  Alphabet Inc.  solidly beat Wall Street’s targets—at least for its mainstay advertising business. Total revenue for the first quarter came in 7% above consensus forecasts tabulated by FactSet, as advertising revenue jumped 32% year over year to $44.7 billion. Overall revenue was aided by a strong turnout for YouTube and Google’s Cloud operation, which posted on-year growth of 49% and 46%, respectively.<br />Even more important was the bottom-line performance for a company historically inclined to chasing expensive dreams. Alphabet’s operating income more than doubled year over year to $16.4 billion, leading to operating margins of 29.7%—the company’s highest since 2013. Alphabet saw a small accounting benefit from extending the life of its network equipment, and its Google Cloud segment reduced its losses by nearly half compared with last year’s first quarter. But the core advertising business remains the star; operating margins for the Google Services segment topped 38% for the quarter.<br />Alphabet’s share price jumped nearly 5% in after-hours trading following the results—a notable gain given the stock’s 19% run since its last report. A $50 billion share buyback announcement also helped. Alphabet has long preferred to hold on to its funds—net cash is now the highest in tech at $121 billion. But growing government scrutiny makes major deals a challenge; the relatively small Fitbit acquisition barely scraped by. And Alphabet is now generating nearly $51 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, leaving the company plenty to invest with.<br />Less clear is whether the results mark a new normal for Google and its related businesses. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat noted on Tuesday’s call that it is still too early to assess the durability of the “elevated consumer online activity” sparked by the pandemic. That $50 billion should help tide investors over for a while though.</td>

      <td>He’s riding the end of the pandemic to pass a radical agenda.</td>
      <td>When President Biden addresses Congress Wednesday evening, he won’t salute his predecessor but he should. Donald Trump’s raucous Presidency has let the Democrat sell a radical agenda in the soothing tones of a return to normal, while the vaccine project known as Operation Warp Speed has teed up the end of the pandemic and an economic revival. This is the main story of Mr. Biden’s first 100 days.<br />Mr. Biden won the White House as the anti-Trump, and he has continued to benefit from that persona in his first months. Half the country is relieved merely to have a President who isn’t constantly brawling on TV in their living rooms. Whether by design, or necessity due to his reduced capacities, the decision to husband Mr. Biden’s public appearances has been shrewd. He’s the calm after the four-year Trump storm.<br />The Democrat has also been lucky in timing, as he took the oath of office as the Covid-19 vaccines were coming online. The White House pretense that it inherited a Covid mess is nonsense. The vaccine production was pre-planned. While some state rollouts were bumpy when there was more vaccine demand than supply, the main job of the Administration was to accelerate the distribution that was already underway.<br />The same goes for the economy, which has been growing since last July, and its acceleration was inevitable as people returned to normal commercial and social life. As New York, Michigan and California have followed the leadership of Texas and Florida in lifting their lockdowns, the inevitable post-pandemic boom has arrived. The same would have happened if Mr. Trump had won.<br />This not to begrudge Mr. Biden his good political fortune. Any successful President needs some luck, and any politician will take credit for it. With so much wind at his back, Mr. Biden could be fulfilling his campaign pledge to unify the country and govern in a bipartisan fashion.</td>

      <td>California’s new plan to increase oil imports and CO2 emissions.</td>
      <td>President Biden has been taking his climate cues from California, which is why Gov. Gavin Newsom’s order banning fracking late last week is sure to cause tremors beyond the state’s borders.<br />“The climate crisis is real, and we continue to see the signs every day,” Mr. Newsom said. “As we move to swiftly decarbonize our transportation sector and create a healthier future for our children, I’ve made it clear I don’t see a role for fracking in that future and, similarly, believe that California needs to move beyond oil.”<br />Legislation that would have banned hydraulic fracturing, otherwise known as fracking, and curtailed most oil production in the state’s Central Valley died in the state Senate earlier this month due to opposition from moderate Democrats and trades unions. Leftwing groups then turned up the heat on Mr. Newsom. With a recall election now all but certain, the Governor doesn’t want to give anyone on the left reason to challenge him.<br />As recently as last fall the Governor asserted he couldn’t ban fracking by fiat. “We simply don’t have that authority,” he said. He was right. Prohibiting fracking at once would also violate the Constitution’s takings clause and require the state to compensate drillers and landowners.<br />Mr. Newsom is instead directing the state’s Department of Conservation to initiate a rule-making to cease new fracking permits by 2024. In the meantime, Mr. Newsom says the department will “operationalize its updated mandate to protect public health and the environment”—i.e., tighten regulation and slow-roll permits.</td>

      <td>Contrary to fears last year, discrepancies helped blue states.</td>
      <td>Remember last year when Democrats accused the Trump Administration of sabotaging the Census? Some sabotage. The population counts for Congressional reapportionment, released this week, far exceeded the Census Bureau’s own estimates in Democratic states. There’s no evidence the Biden Administration rigged reapportionment, but the disparity deserves examination.<br />The 2020 reapportionment produced few surprises, as several Sun Belt states picked up four House seats while six in the Northeast and Midwest lost one each. But New York, Rhode Island and Alabama lost fewer seats than expected while Arizona, Texas and Florida gained fewer.<br />The problem seems to be the Census Bureau’s data. Predictions were based on the bureau’s 2020 population estimates that incorporate data on births, deaths and migration. The bureau’s estimates and count usually match up closely—and did in most states this year. But there were unusually large disparities in the Northeast and Sun Belt.<br />New York’s count was a whopping 818,876 higher than the bureau’s 2020 estimate, which is probably why it lost one seat rather than two as many predicted. Counts were far higher than the bureau’s estimates in New Jersey (398,111), Pennsylvania (208,296), Illinois (197,346), Massachusetts (131,801), California (119,329) and Maryland (117,695). On the other hand, Arizona’s count was 242,398 lower than estimated, which may have cost it a seat. Counts in Florida (-150,052), North Carolina (-142,497) and Texas (-140,962) were also lower by large margins.<br />The disparities between the bureau’s counts and estimates were smaller in 2010 and didn’t show a regional or partisan bias. Only Florida (164,942), North Carolina (102,562), Arizona (-262,341), Georgia (-196,881), New York (-186,100) and Illinois (-100,952) had counts off by more than 100,000.</td>

Mr. Phillips has denied the allegations in the New York lawsuit.<br />In March, Mr. Phillips declined to testify during a deposition related to the NRA’s chapter 11, invoking the Fifth Amendment. In its filing this week, the NRA said Mr. Phillips’s decision suggests that representations he made as CFO to the Internal Revenue Service, auditors and the organization may not have been truthful, complete or accurate.<br />“The NRA relied on Phillips, a fiduciary, to make truthful representations to the organization and, based on his invocation of his Fifth Amendment right as described above, is entitled to infer that they were not,” the group said in its filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas.</td>

      <td>Florida already has among the most expansive school-choice offerings in the nation, and this week the Legislature expanded private-school vouchers to more families.<br />Florida established the Family Empowerment Scholarship (FES) program in 2019 to help low-income students attend private schools. In the 2020-2021 school year, more than 36,000 students participated, with an average scholarship of nearly $7,000.<br />The bill increases the eligible household income cap from 300% to 375% of the poverty level—about $100,000 for a family of four—though it prioritizes households under 185%. The enrollment cap will continue to escalate by 1% of public-school enrollment annually, allowing roughly 28,000 new students each year.<br />The new bill also folds special-needs scholarships into the FES program, which it caps at 20,000. But an automatic escalator lets capacity increase every year by about 4,500 students. The special-needs funds are education savings accounts that can be used for tutoring and other services.<br />One of the bill’s biggest boons is extending scholarships to students already in private school. Under current law, only students enrolled in public school can apply. Eliminating this requirement will help private-school families who have suffered financially from the pandemic or can no longer afford private tuition for other reasons. Applicants from public schools also don’t count toward program caps.</td>

Liberals and Democrats expressed relief at the verdict, while many conservatives criticized it. Many on both sides seemed to believe they knew the “right verdict” in advance, and then reacted to the jury’s decision accordingly. Few showed any inclination to trust the jury’s deliberation and judgment on their own terms. Since judicial bodies are designed to be authoritative sources, this is highly concerning. If Americans no longer hold any special reverence for institutions of jury and court, the legitimacy of the entire legal system is at risk.<br />—Thomas Brodey, Amherst College, history</td>

      <td>ORLANDO, Fla.—House GOP leaders presented clashing views at their annual gathering over the 2020 election, the best way to win back control of Congress and the role former President Donald Trump will play in the party’s future.<br />At a retreat 100 days into President Biden’s administration, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming charted out different paths for the GOP. Ms. Cheney has urged the party to distance itself from the former president, while Mr. McCarthy has emphasized unity, including with Mr. Trump.<br />The split intensified after a mob of Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in protest of Congress certifying Mr. Biden’s electoral victories. Nearly four months later, House GOP leaders are largely united on economic and social policies but divided over the role Mr. Trump should play, as the party enters the midterm election cycle and whether Republicans should publicly criticize him. Mr. Trump has continued to state, without evidence, that he won the presidential election last fall.<br />“We have to learn the lessons from 2020. It’s one of the reasons why it’s so damaging to perpetuate the notion that in 2020, the election was stolen,” said Ms. Cheney in an interview. She was one of 10 Republicans to vote to impeach Mr. Trump in January over the allegation he incited the mob. He was acquitted in the Senate.<br />That message isn’t what other GOP leaders have touted since the 2020 elections, where House Republicans also picked up seats and winnowed Democrats’ majority to the surprise of many forecasters. The GOP also performed better than expected among Hispanic voters in Florida and Texas, which Republicans chalk up to their efforts to link Democrats to socialism.</td>

The high court, which wiped out a $1.3 billion judgment involving a deceptive payday-lending scheme, said Congress would need to explicitly grant the FTC that power.<br />Ms. Slaughter said the ruling threatened current cases involving unsubstantiated Covid-19 cures, a pyramid scheme, a scam involving fake apartment listings and a case alleging jailed former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli and others orchestrated anticompetitive price hikes in the drug Daraprim. Mr. Shkreli has denied the allegations.</td>

      <td>Regressiveness plus moral hazard: There’s nothing to like about deductibility of state and local taxes.</td>
      <td>Seventeen House Democrats from New York wrote their leaders April 13 threatening “to oppose any tax legislation that does not include a full repeal of the SALT limitation.” That’s an acronym for state and local taxes, only $10,000 of which are deductible on an individual tax return under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The White House has signaled its openness to abolishing the cap.<br />“The SALT deduction was essential to New York and other progressive states,” the Empire State lawmakers write. Restoring it “would ensure that the state is able to recover as quickly as possible without sacrificing the benefits on which our residents rely.”<br />Democratic governors and local lawmakers dream of socialism without taxation, whereby local spending is partly financed by taxpayers from more fiscally prudent jurisdictions. Without the SALT-deduction subsidy, their policies become even more of a nightmare for taxpayers, who in growing numbers are leaving behind big-government states.<br />Reinstating the SALT deduction is meant to ease the pressure on high-tax states’ finances by shifting some of the burden to taxpayers in low-tax states, thereby reducing the incentive for taxpayers to move. It’s a political solution to an economic problem caused by politicians.<br />State and local governments are already highly misaligned in their incentives to tax and spend too much. More than a third of their total revenue comes from so-called intergovernmental transfers, which tilt trade-offs to favor government growth. The federal government pays the majority of the largest spending item on the state level, Medicaid. The 20% or so of President Biden’s “infrastructure” plan dedicated to Medicaid would only add to this problem, as will the bailouts of local governments in the American Rescue Plan, the most recent Covid relief bill.</td>

Adds Mr. Balk:<br />He’s describing the results of the annual Seattle Public Safety Survey conducted by researchers at Seattle University. But a close examination of the data suggests that the defunding movement never got much traction in Seattle either, outside of media and political circles.<br />When Seattle residents were asked last fall to select their top public safety priorities, the most popular categories were police capacity, property crime and homelessness. By “police capacity” respondents mean there are not enough officers in their neighborhoods and law enforcement responses are not fast enough, whether for emergency or non-emergency calls. Within the broad category of property crime is the overall number one concern across all categories: “car prowls,” meaning something being stolen from inside a car. Meanwhile in the quality-of-life category, “too many police in the neighborhood” ranked an overall 64th.<br />“People are saying they want more” not fewer police, Professor Jacqueline Helfgott, the study’s principal author, tells Seattle television station KOMO.</td>

The ESL was conceived as an annual competition of 20 of the world’s best soccer teams—and as a way to recover from enormous financial losses during the Covid-pandemic. It was hatched in a series of secret negotiations among team owners.<br />According to the ESL’s April 18 press release, 15 teams would have had permanent status as “Founding Clubs”—six in the U.K. (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City,  Manchester United ,  Tottenham), three in Italy (A.C. Milan, Inter Milan, Juventus) and three in Spain (Atlético Madrid, Barcelona, Real Madrid). Three more founding members were to be announced, and five clubs would have joined through an annual  “qualifying mechanism . . . based on achievements in the prior season.”<br />JPMorgan  reportedly committed a $5 billion grant to this competition, most of which would go to support team’s “infrastructure investment plans and to offset the impact of the COVID pandemic,” according to the ESL press release. When that news dropped, so did the jaws of other team owners, players and soccer fans. The 12 founding clubs are among the 16 wealthiest in association football, according to Forbes’s 2021 list. Most on the outside viewed the ESL as an elitist venture creating an exclusionary competition.<br />Over the next two days, huge fan protests erupted on the streets of the cities of the six U.K.-based teams. Politicians spoke out. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the proposal “very damaging.” The Union of European Football Associations, European soccer’s administrative body, and the International Federation of Association Football, the sport’s governing body (known by the French acronym FIFA), threatened to expel ESL teams and players from competitions.<br />Two days after ESL’s announcement, Chelsea yielded to the pressure and said it would drop out. Manchester City formally did so about 30 minutes later. Others quickly followed.</td>

      <td>Obsessed with theories of ‘systemic racism’ and ‘unconscious bias,’ the media ignores good news.</td>
      <td>You wouldn’t know if from recent headlines, but there’s good news about race in the U.S. today. The pessimism peddled on the left by pundits and elected officials is in the service of an ideological agenda, and it’s probably doing more real harm to race relations than any actual racism.<br />A big part of the problem is that the political press has never come to grips with Donald Trump’s election in 2016. The media didn’t anticipate it, refused to accept it, and have been willfully misinterpreting the reasons for it. Their preferred narrative is that racists, sexists and xenophobes put Mr. Trump in the White House, thus demonstrating that hatred and bigotry in the U.S. are ascendant. But is it true?<br />First, it’s worth clarifying (yet again) that former supporters of Barack Obama, not white nationalists, were the voters responsible for Mr. Trump’s election. Only occasionally did the establishment media acknowledge this in its reporting. “It’s clear that large numbers of white, working-class voters shifted from the Democrats to Mr. Trump,” reads a  New York Times  dispatch from 2017. “He flipped millions of white working-class Obama supporters to his side. The voter file data makes it impossible to avoid this conclusion.”<br />If journalists haven’t avoided this conclusion entirely, they’ve spent far more time pushing an alternative explanation that cites supposed racial retrenchment in the U.S. as the main driver of Mr. Trump’s political success. The fruits of this effort are laid bare by political scientist Eric Kaufmann in a compelling new report from the Manhattan Institute. Using survey data, Mr. Kaufmann notes that racial attitudes have been trending toward more tolerance for well over half a century, even as black politicians (Mr. Obama, Kamala Harris), professional polemicists (Ta-Nehisi Coates, Ibram X. Kendi) and major media organs (the New York Times’s “1619 Project”) continue to insist otherwise.<br />According to Mr. Kaufmann, “at a time when measures of racist attitudes and behavior have never been more positive, pessimism about racism and race relations has increased in America.” Terms like “systemic racism” and “unconscious bias” are increasingly common, but white racist views have been in steady decline, whether with regard to having black co-workers, classmates or neighbors.</td>

      <td>The U.S. liberation of Europe was a shambolic enterprise as all gargantuan novel efforts tend to be: “Swimming” tanks carried their crews straight to the bottom on D-Day; Eisenhower was at wit’s end over Allied bombing of friendly troops; in the war’s last months, the U.S. contended not just with the enemy but thousands of U.S. deserters engaged in pilfering and reselling American supplies.<br />The liberation was nonetheless successful because of a broad commitment in the American electorate and society to getting it done.<br />Eisenhower later as president would limit himself to realistic aims: an interstate highway system, the U2 program that allowed the U.S. to measure Soviet ICBM capabilities against the hysterical claims of Khrushchev and the Democrats.<br />Which brings us to Joe Biden. He speaks as if he has a mandate to do heroic things regardless of cost; hard to pick up amid the verbal grandiosity are the one or two realistic ones he perhaps hopes to accomplish. He might get a union-built electric-vehicle charging network, but the alleged problem of climate change would remain as unaffected as ever.<br />To govern is to choose, notes the journal Foreign Affairs, but “the administration of President Joe Biden often seems to believe that to govern . . . is to choose nearly everything.”</td>

      <td>A true-crime chronicler examines an act of mass murder from 1927 and the disturbing backstory of the man who committed it.</td>
      <td>Neither the Columbine High School shooting in April 1999, in Colorado, nor the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December 2012, in Connecticut, can properly be called the deadliest school massacre in U.S. history. Nor can any other similar atrocity in recent memory. That dismal distinction, as Harold Schechter notes in “Maniac,” a concise, harrowing work of social history, goes to the May 1927 disaster in Bath, Mich., in which 45 people (38 of them children) were killed in the dynamiting of a school building and the detonation of a car bomb.<br />Mr. Schechter, a veteran chronicler of notorious crimes and criminals, introduces us to the villain behind these horrific deeds: Andrew P. Kehoe, a sadistic farmer and school-board member with a list of perceived grievances as long as his adult life. His main complaints came to center on Emory Huyck, superintendent of the Bath Consolidated School, a new edifice designed to meet the latest standards in education. Huyck, an ex-military man possessing “absolute self-assurance and comfort with exercising authority,” as Mr. Schechter puts it, proved anathema to Kehoe.<br />The new school was paid for by a tax that Kehoe blamed for preventing him from paying off his farm’s mortgage. When the married but childless Kehoe lost a local election for town clerk, his anger grew. He let his crops rot in the field and turned his energies—and considerable engineering talent—to the concoction of an elaborate scheme to destroy the school at a time when its 250 pupils were inside. Working as a repairman, he had unimpeded access to the building, where he began hiding bundles of dynamite to be detonated by timer on May 18, 1927.<br />Before the explosion, Kehoe murdered his wife, Nellie, and set fire to his farmstead (with horses trapped, legs tied to prevent escape). He then raced into town by automobile to inspect the school damage. At Bath Consolidated, citizens were frantically digging survivors and bodies out of the semi-demolished building. Kehoe called out from his car to Huyck, one of the rescuers, to come over; Huyck was civil enough to comply. At this point, Kehoe detonated the booby-trapped vehicle, killing both men.<br />Andrew Kehoe and his heinous acts became headline news around the nation, until aviator Charles Lindbergh and his solo flight from New York to Paris pushed “the mad butcher of Bath” off the front page. In the meantime, Mr. Schechter writes, the specter of Kehoe was appropriated by various factions to promote their own agendas. The Ku Klux Klan printed a pamphlet blaming Kehoe’s actions on his Roman Catholic upbringing. Eugenics supporters offered Kehoe as proof of the need for “the sterilizing of mental defectives.”</td>

The administration’s response has been met with criticism from both sides of the aisle.<br />Mr. Gonzalez, who has served as Harris County sheriff since 2017, ended a partnership that year with ICE—the Department of Homeland Security agency that is charged with arresting and deporting immigrants—that authorized local officials to enforce federal immigration laws in the county.<br />ICE has said the program creating those partnerships, which was adopted under federal law in 1996, helps local and federal officials better identify and remove criminals from the country.<br />Mr. Gonzalez also criticized immigration raids under the Trump administration in a tweet in July 2019. “I do not support #ICERaids that threaten to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, the vast majority of whom do not represent a threat to the U.S.,” Mr. Gonzalez wrote that month, when the raids occurred. “The focus should always be on clear & immediate safety threats.”</td>

      <td>In a smart Netflix film based on the book ‘All Things Cease to Appear,’ Amanda Seyfried stars as a young mother who comes to suspect that her marriage and new home have a dark side.</td>
      <td>It’s the rare supernatural thriller that finds its philosophical underpinnings in the Christian mystic Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772), who was viewed as both enlightened and mad but can certainly put a spin on a ghost story: Per Swedenborg’s benign view of the spirit world, it isn’t the dead of “Things Heard & Seen” who should inspire loathing. It’s the living.<br />Based on “All Things Cease to Appear,” by the novelist Elizabeth Brundage, the film is written and directed by the wife-husband team of Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, whose eclectic filmography(“American Splendor,” “Girl Most Likely’) does not include horror—something that probably helps make their foray into genre real estate, i.e. the haunted house, refreshingly unfamiliar. The house itself is somewhere in upstate New York, “upstate” always being north of wherever you start out, which in the case of the Claires—bulimic art restorer Catherine (Amanda Seyfried) and generally untrustworthy George (James Norton)—is the Upper West Side, circa 1980. Although Catherine loves her job, and the city, and they have a 4-year-old child and don’t seem to know anyone north of Westchester, she will follow George to his new job teaching art history at small, private Saginaw College in a town ominously called Chosen.<br />The mood is appropriately chilly; the sun always seems to be setting in Chosen, a has-been dairy community populated by “rich horsy weekenders and full-time rednecks,” as one city friend acidly describes it. The century-old farmhouse that the Claires buy has a history—of course—though it’s a history unrevealed to Catherine for a large part of the film. There’s a perfectly functional piano someone simply left behind. (“It’s very sad,” says their real-estate agent, played by the wonderful Karen Allen.) And there’s a sparking clown lamp in their daughter’s room that someone should have thrown out as soon as specters started appearing in the hallways.<br />Not everything is explained in the Berman-Pulcini script, or serves an obvious function—Catherine’s bulimia, for instance, or her Catholicism, which may be untidy threads left over after tailoring the novel for the screen. Some details are intended to be funny, and some are: the sheet music for “Lacrimosa” (from Mozart’s Requiem) peeking under a closet door, or the fact that the couple’s new friend, Justine (Rhea Seehorn), is the “adjunct weaving instructor” at Saginaw. Viewers currently paying college tuition may chuckle.<br />What really does work is the acting. Ms. Seyfried, Oscar-nominated for “Mank” this year, plays Catherine as tightly wound but self-possessed. She’s not driven to distraction by the spirit world. She finds in it some solace, especially in light of the seemingly congenital dishonesty of her husband. In what is perhaps the film’s best single scene, Catherine and Floyd DeBeers—George’s department head and the resident Swedenborg devotee, played by F. Murray Abraham—share a moment of empathy with the unseen population of Chosen and the history that is keeping the spirits from rest. It’s an emotional coup for both actors. We expect that level of commitment from Mr. Abraham. We’re coming to expect it from Ms. Seyfried.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats on Capitol Hill are making last-minute calls for the White House to propose making a recent expansion of the child tax credit permanent, in a final round of lobbying ahead of President Biden’s speech Wednesday evening laying out his antipoverty package.<br />Democrats expanded the child tax credit for 2021 only as part of their $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package in March, increasing the amount of the credit from $2,000 to $3,000 and $3,600 for children under 6 years old. The law also made the credit refundable and available in periodic payments, instead of one lump sum.<br />The White House is expected to propose continuing the new child tax credit through 2025 as part of a roughly $1.8 trillion antipoverty plan, which will also dedicate funding toward paid leave, tuition-free community college and universal prekindergarten.<br />A temporary extension falls short of Democratic aspirations for the expanded credit, which advocates say could cut child poverty in half. A group of Democrats is set to meet with White House advisers on Tuesday while making the case for a permanent extension, the latest in a series of meetings in which lawmakers have pressed the administration on the issue.<br />Several top Democrats said Tuesday they would seek to amend Mr. Biden’s plan to make the expanded tax credit. They warned that a temporary extension risks the expiration of the benefit, effectively encouraging the administration to take maximum advantage of Democrats’ control of government while they have it.</td>

      <td>An HBO Max documentary tells the story of a professor and his wife who raised a chimpanzee as their ‘daughter.’</td>
      <td>It’s easy to view “Lucy the Human Chimp” as a kind of Frankenstein story, a tragedy of scientific overreach and arrogance that could only have ended badly. It doesn’t, not entirely: Janis Carter, the principal character in this Channel 4 production, redeems her species through a selflessness that one might call superhuman. But while she never waxes indignant, a viewer just might.<br />In the ’60s, with primatology a fashionable area of academic study, a University of Oklahoma psychologist and his wife, Maurice and Jane Temerlin, decided to raise a chimpanzee as a human being, as an experiment in nature vs. nurture. It was a scholarly venture rooted in a kind of original sin—the infant Lucy-to-be was basically ape-napped at 2 days old while her mother was sedated. Brought to Oklahoma, she became a sensation, especially in scholarly circles, as the primate who could eat with silverware, serve tea and mix herself a gin and tonic. She also learned American Sign Language, though to what degree is a matter of debate.<br />That it couldn’t last was beyond predictable. By the age of 11, the adolescent animal—whom the Temerlins referred to as their “daughter”—had become uncontrollable, sexually aggressive with males from outside the “family,” and as a result spent most of her time in a cage. “People stopped visiting,” Ms. Temerlin recalls, in a voiceover that is intended, and fails, to generate sympathy. (Maurice Temerlin died in 1988.)<br />Ms. Carter was at first just one of a series of university students hired to perform ape maintenance. And even though Lucy is remembered as having been “arrogant and condescending” about Ms. Carter’s shortcomings in sign language, and any intimacy between Lucy and her various caretakers had been forbidden by the Temerlins, the two grew close. When it was decided in 1977 that Lucy would be sent to a rehabilitation center in Gambia—where chimps were taught to be chimps—Ms. Carter was asked to come along. And it was she, alone among the humans, who stayed behind in Africa.<br />“Lucy the Human Chimp” is a creative assemblage of sundry parts: The archival footage, of which there is a wealth; the news coverage given Lucy when she was a celebrity; and extensive restagings and re-enactments, a device that in many documentaries is either stiff or profoundly unreal but under Alex Parkinson’s direction—and with Lorna Nickson Brown in the role of Janis Carter—rings true. (The smaller roles of the Temerlins are played by Matthew Brenher and Jacinta Mulcahy.) It’s a largely silent performance by Ms. Brown, but she’s our emotional touchstone as the real Ms. Carter narrates and the story moves from Oklahoma to Africa and ultimately to the remote Baboon Island in the River Gambia. There, Ms. Carter remained, with Lucy and a trio of other chimps who made her life into inescapable chaos.</td>

      <td>The hip-hop trio favored comfortable, sporty Adidas sets decades ago and, in the Covid era, elevated versions are thriving. Here’s how to get the look.</td>
      <td>THE TRACKSUIT IS one highly evocative article of clothing. For many music fans, the word could easily conjure images of Run-DMC (above), the intrepid hip-hop trio from Queens, N.Y., who in the 1980s bounded across arena stages in matching Adidas tracksuits. Cinephiles might picture Chas Tenenbaum (Ben Stiller), the depressive dad who wore a red Adidas tracksuit in 2001’s “The Royal Tenenbaums,” or Bruce Lee, who did battle in a yolk-yellow version in 1978’s “Game of Death.” Those binge-watching “The Sopranos” will likely envision Paulie Walnuts (Tony Sirico), the silver-haired heavy who wore velour zip-up sets through the series’s run.<br />And those are just tracksuiters in the pop-culture realm. When asked for his associations, Keanan Duffty, director of fashion programs at New York’s Parsons School of Design, mentioned the wild tracksuit-y sets in a 1983 runway show from British designer Vivienne Westwood. Meanwhile, Hussein Suleiman, a co-founder of Daily Paper, an 8-year-old Amsterdam-based label, cited a more modern reference: North African immigrants in France who wear “the brightest colored” tracksuits associated with football clubs like Olympic and Marseilles.<br />Despite its existing fan base, the tracksuit gained more devotees during quarantine. It became a bestseller at Daily Paper over the last year, “when everybody started doing work-from-home outfits,” said Mr. Suleiman, who wears a tracksuit almost daily. His simple explanation? “People just like to wear more comfortable stuff.”<br />British retailer End Clothing likewise saw a jump in tracksuit interest this past year. It’s a “very easy” look to pull on before dragging yourself through yet another day of virtual conferences, explained Chris Fisher, the shop’s senior buyer.<br />The range of tracksuit options has also broadened significantly of late. According to Edited, a retail market intelligence company, 81% more tracksuits are available on major e-commerce websites this year, compared with last year. Krista Corrigan, one of the retail analysts at Edited, speculated that “a propensity for nostalgia and throwback trends” is fueling the tracksuit’s popularity. To be sure, you’ll find many standard, solid-color tracksuits that call back to ’80s joggers, old-school English football fans and yes, Run-DMC. Purists appreciate that Adidas’s iconic three-stripe tracksuit has barely changed since it was introduced in 1967 as gear for hobbyist exercisers and sprinters in need of warm-up attire. But many tracksuits today deliver quite a bit more oomph than their athletic ancestors.</td>

The 14-day moving average for deaths reported from Covid-19 fell to about 2,670 as of Monday, after reaching 3,000 earlier in April.<br />Almost 39 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given to residents of the country, in a total population of just over 213 million people, but supply issues have slowed progress. Brazilian authorities are administering Covid-19 vaccines made by Chinese drugmaker Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and the shot developed jointly by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC.<br />Russia pushed back against Brazil’s decision, saying the regulator’s move was motivated by politics.</td>

Instead, the experts are expected to urge the release of more data as well as more testing of animals and humans for early evidence of the new coronavirus, including in parts of southern China where related viruses were previously found.<br />The submission of the recommendations will test Washington’s clout—both within the WHO and among the member states that decide its priorities—after President Biden’s administration reversed a Trump administration plan to withdraw from the U.N. agency. In a statement issued at the end of March, the U.S. and 13 other member states urged “a timely, transparent evidence-based process for the next phase” of the search.<br />U.S. officials said they plan to submit the recommendations to the WHO in coming days after consulting with other nations that are preparing to submit recommendations of their own.

Many developing countries have vaccinated only a tiny portion of their population, including front-line health workers.<br />In particular, India’s export restrictions are highlighting a major weakness in the World Health Organization-backed Covax initiative, a program financed mostly by Western governments to distribute free shots to 92 low- and middle-income countries.<br />The majority of Covax’s supplies for this year—including vaccines developed by the joint effort of the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC as well as by U.S.-based  Novavax Inc. —are being produced in India.

      <td>Voters like the president’s demeanor, and he can notch a win on infrastructure.</td>
      <td>As Joe Biden heads toward the 100th day of his presidency and prepares to address the nation, he has reason to feel good about his time in office so far. His job approval is holding steady in the mid-50s, and he is getting high marks for his character, leadership and demeanor. The public supports his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially his vaccine rollout. He quickly passed his first major initiative, the American Rescue Plan. His aides appear to be working well together, and for the most part internal conflicts have been kept off the front pages.<br />Mr. Biden has also done well in another important dimension of the presidency—his role as party leader. Surveys have shown nearly unanimous support for him among Democrats. This isn’t surprising, because his statements and proposals have reflected the center of gravity in the Democratic Party. Cynics dismissed the results of last year’s postprimary negotiations between progressives and the center left as a campaign truce that would give way to factional fighting after the election. Instead, these unity documents have turned out to be reliable predictors of the administration’s stances.<br />There is one conspicuous exception—the administration’s handling of refugees. Democrats criticized President Trump for lowering the annual cap on refugee admissions to 15,000. During his campaign, Mr. Biden promised to raise it to 125,000. After hesitating for several months, however, earlier this month he declined to increase it, provoking a backlash from his party that forced him to change course.<br />As the controversy unfolded, the press reported that the president had rebuffed a plea from Secretary of State Antony Blinken not to maintain Mr. Trump’s cap. This is a classic example of John F. Kennedy’s maxim that victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan. No administration is exempt from public discord when officials want to distance themselves from unpopular policies.<br />As the president looks beyond his first big proposal to two others—the recent American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan, which reportedly will be released ahead of his national address—he faces a choice: Will he try to pass initiatives totaling more than $4 trillion with the votes of Democrats only, or will he accept the compromises needed to bring some Republicans on board?</td>

      <td>The Pentagon hasn’t spelled out how it would win a maritime war against China.</td>
      <td>The U.S. Navy is at sea, figuratively as well as literally. It has 101 ships deployed around the world—the same number as during the Cold War—yet the entire fleet is only 297 vessels strong. That’s about half the Reagan-era level of nearly 600. The consequences of maintaining current global commitments with a shrunken fleet include long deployments—some sailors spend close to a year at sea—as well as more maintenance and less time for training.<br />The figurative sense in which the Navy is at sea is more important and more dangerous. The fleet doesn’t have enough ships to meet global commitments, even as the U.S. faces growing naval competition from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Each of these potential adversaries possesses missiles and aircraft whose sole purpose is to keep U.S. naval forces at bay. Sixty-four percent of China’s maritime trade and 40% of its overall trade flows through the South China Sea, through which U.S. naval ships sail regularly.<br />Were hostilities to break out between China and the U.S., the conflict would be a naval one. It would test the U.S. ability to move naval and amphibious forces across the 7,000-mile Pacific moat in time to assist American allies and partners, deny China’s use of the shipping lanes between it and the Middle East, and operate effectively to command the South China, East China and Yellow seas. The Chinese Navy would be a formidable foe. It has long-range missiles, a nascent aircraft-carrier force and increasingly modern ships and weapons of all categories, as well as cyber and space capabilities.<br />Simply building more U.S. ships and submarines wouldn’t be enough to meet the challenge. Strategic thinking and a change in fleet design and tactics will be necessary. In the 1930s, the Navy and Marine Corps identified Japan as a likely future enemy and developed—and practiced—the ideas of naval aviation and island-hopping that eventually won the Pacific War.<br />On Dec. 17 then-Navy Secretary Kenneth Braithwaite released a document billed as a “tri-service maritime strategy.” Signed by the chiefs of the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, “Advantage at Sea” correctly identifies China as a “pressing, long-term threat” and calls for traditional—and important—actions such as integrated operations, allied participation, modernization and sea control. But it isn’t a maritime strategy. It offers no suggestions about how to win a naval war against China.</td>

The Dearborn, Mich.-based auto maker eventually plans to manufacture its own battery cells, product chief Hau Thai-Tang said during a media call Tuesday.<br />Major auto makers are diverting much of their capital spending into electric vehicles, prodded by tougher emissions regulations globally and the emergence of electric-vehicle leader  Tesla Inc.  and a slate of startups.<br />Some legacy car companies are following Tesla’s lead by making electric-vehicle components in-house rather than relying on outside suppliers. Batteries are by far the most expensive component of plug-in cars, accounting for a quarter or more of the vehicle’s total cost, and factories to make battery cells require huge outlays of capital.<br />Analysts have said Ford is behind rivals in making the pivot to electric vehicles when investors are betting big on companies that make them. Since he took over the company last fall, Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley has signaled a more aggressive approach to plug-in cars, including a move into batteries.</td>

      <td>Despite an encouraging rebound in flight bookings, jet-engine makers are rightly cautious about upgrading their guidance</td>
      <td>As the summer approaches, prospects of a travel recovery are lifting spirits across the aviation industry. But jet-engine makers are still cautious, and for good reason.<br />On Tuesday, two top U.S. industrial conglomerates,  General Electric  and  Raytheon Technologies ,  reported first-quarter earnings showing the continuing impact of the pandemic. GE lost $2.8 billion due to a 28% year-over-year drop in aviation revenue. Raytheon notched a $753 million profit, 44% below 2019 levels. Both its aviation-parts division Collins Aerospace and the Pratt & Whitney engine business are still suffering.<br />Based on the median of analyst estimates collected by Visible Alpha, GE’s aviation sales won’t recover to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 and profits will take even longer.<br />The reason is that these companies make most of their aviation earnings in the so-called aftermarket—maintenance and repair. This is especially the case for jet engines, which are usually sold at a loss and claw profits back over a period of years. This revenue is volatile because during crises, carriers defer shop visits and retire older planes. Losing a chunk of their installed base reduces the companies’ future earnings potential, even if a rise in engine sales allows revenues to recover: Visible Alpha doesn’t expect Pratt’s aftermarket sales to match pre-pandemic figures for the foreseeable future.<br />But there are now hopeful signs that the travel recovery being reported by airlines is filtering through to the rest of the aviation industry.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration will propose an $80 billion funding boost for the Internal Revenue Service over the next decade, aiming to strengthen tax enforcement against the wealthiest Americans, according to two people familiar with the plan.<br />The administration projects that its plan would generate about $700 billion in net taxes that would otherwise go uncollected, the people said. It is an aggressive estimate that relies on more audits, alongside the administration’s proposals to raise tax rates on the ordinary income and capital gains of high-income taxpayers.<br />The proposals are expected to be included in the roughly $1.8 trillion antipoverty proposal that President Biden is expected to detail Wednesday in a speech to Congress. The money from tax enforcement and higher rates would pay for an extension of the expanded child tax credit along with programs to expand child care and funding for community college.<br />Compared with taking the current $12 billion IRS budget and increasing it by 5% annually, the $80 billion addition would increase the agency’s size by more than 50%. In addition to experienced enforcement staff, the IRS has been asking Congress for more money to modernize its computer systems.<br />The IRS plan also is expected to include changes to information-reporting rules that would provide the agency with more data about Americans’ financial activities. When the government has independent information about income—such as W-2 forms with wage data—compliance rates are nearly 100%. Where it doesn’t have such information—much business income—compliance rates are often about half that level.</td>

      <td>It’s a circus of hot air. It’s also a rare television event that keeps getting bigger.</td>
      <td>Have you mocked your NFL draft yet? If not, please get mocking. Release your picks! Don’t tell me who the Jacksonville Jaguars are taking at No. 1—even my cat presumes Jax will take the lustrous-maned Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence. Tell me who the San Francisco 49ers are taking at No. 3, because nobody seems 100% sure, maybe not even the 49ers. Tell me, with bravado, who the New England Patriots will take at No. 15. Will the Pats stay there, trade up, or will Grumpy Lobster Boat Captain Bill Belichick trade down into the drafty depths? Who will the Tampa Bay Buccaneers pluck at No. 32? What will the Chicago Bears do at No. 83? Or, for that matter, at No. 204? Who will the Pittsburgh Steelers take at No. 254? Come on! You’ve had nearly 12 months to think about this. You must have at least an inkling.<br />Football’s draft, which kicks off Thursday night in Cleveland, is the biggest, most beautiful gas factory in all of sports, a monthslong blabby-blab blab-a-thon in which well-sourced experts, armchair fans and mediocre sports columnists at financial newspapers compete for the right to be wrong at least 50% of the time. A power company could charge the nation with the hot air annually expelled in the weeks leading up to this event—who’s moving up; who’s moving down; who’s the hot pick; who’ll pull off a draft-day heist for the ages. Nobody really knows! And the jargon: You’re not an official draft guru unless you’re tossing off buzzy terms like “arm talent.” Arm talent! What does that even mean? Are the football cognoscenti now evaluating the skill of a solitary arm, disembodied from the rest of the human being, like The Thing in “The Addams Family?” Isn’t arm talent like, just, you know, throwing?<br />It doesn’t matter. Get it right, get it wrong, the draft is a huge deal, really an optimal event for these times, a windy feast of gossip, cherry-picked facts and baseless speculation—America’s second, third and fourth favorite past times, after screaming at each other on social media about pandemic face masks. In the information-is-everywhere era, the draft has turned marvelously democratic: You don’t need to be decked in Brioni on TV to have a sizzling, or even smarter, take on BYU quarterback Zach Wilson, Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields, or the current, allegedly-surging quarterback darling, Trey Lance of North Dakota State. You don’t have to be able to finish a 40-yard dash to have profound wisdom on the proper 40-yard dash time for an NFL player. All you need is access to a computer. And a mouth.<br />If you’re doing it right, you’re talking in circles now. The draft is barely hours away, so by now you’ve talked yourself in and out of every outcome, and then talked yourself in and out of every outcome again, and maybe once more. Every possible trade has been picked apart and rejected, then reconsidered and re-assembled anew. Even the people who will be in the official war rooms seem headspun and exhausted. Here’s San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan, responding to speculation about whether or not his club will select a quarterback, pushing out current starter Jimmy Garoppolo:<br />“I can’t guarantee that anybody in the world will be alive Sunday, so I can’t guarantee who will be on our roster on Sunday.”</td>

Fewer newcomers are giving cities a try, meaning the people moving out aren’t being replaced by fresh residents.<br />Suburbs are emerging as the winners from these changes, marking the end of a decadelong growth trend for big cities. Companies intent on lowering overhead and retaining talent are opening offices there, and developers are adding amenities to keep entertainment dollars local.<br />In the largest cities, the changes are helping erase billions of dollars of annual property tax revenue and fueling double-digit decreases in rents. In 2020, higher-income neighborhoods lost more residents to migration than lower-income neighborhoods.<br />With many companies signaling a new openness to remote work after the pandemic ends, cities are bracing for a future where spending on public transportation, lunches and other drivers of the urban economy don’t return to pre-pandemic levels.</td>

      <td>Alan S. Blinder traces President Biden’s boom economy (“Welcome to Joe Biden’s Boom Economy,” op-ed, April 22) to five causes: the $2.2 trillion Cares Act in March 2020, the swiftness of Treasury and Federal Reserve monetary accommodation, the additional $900 billion in relief at the end of 2020, vaccinations and the $1.9 trillion American Relief Plan passed last month. The first two were implemented under the Trump administration with a broad consensus. The additional $900 billion relief act, which drew reasonable criticism, was enacted at the end of the Trump administration. By Mr. Blinder’s standard, the score is 3-0 Trump-Biden thus far.<br />The vaccination rate has increased steadily, which can be interpreted as a continuation under President Biden of a trend that commenced during the Trump administration. Given the effect of Operation Warp Speed, ignored by Mr. Blinder, the success of the vaccination rollout is at best a draw for the Biden administration. The fifth cause, the $1.9 trillion American Relief Plan, must be credited to the Biden administration, though it continues to be criticized for its effect on employment and national debt. Score: 3-1-1 in favor of the Trump administration.<br />One final point: Tax cuts and government spending are both types of fiscal stimulus. Mr. Blinder warned that the Trump administration’s 2017 tax cuts would cause a “sugar high,” yet now he remains silent on the potential sugar high from the incredible government spending and monetary accommodation during the last year.<br />Mike Lytle<br />Locust Valley, N.Y.</td>

Although the wealthy residents of the Hamptons succeeded in preventing offshore wind farms from spoiling their ocean views, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management intends to sink all opposition to development in the New York-New Jersey Bight, a roughly triangular area bordered by New Jersey and Long Island.<br />In December 2020, the Interior Department’s Office of the Solicitor issued a detailed ruling that commercial fisheries’ interests must be considered when siting offshore wind. But in March the Biden administration rescinded that ruling. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management intends to ignore fisheries’ interests, even though the Bight is home to some of the most productive fisheries in the world and is a migratory route for endangered right whales.<br />In the end, the fisheries industry and thousands of jobs at risk are no match for Big Wind’s lobbyists, whose European customers stand to reap billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars from the Biden administration’s new offshore wind-investment tax credit and the sky-high prices for the intermittent and unreliable power that regulators will force utility customers to buy.<br />Jonathan Lesser<br />President, Continental Economics</td>

On paper the banks are similar, but investors can expect UBS to stay ahead.<br />On Tuesday, the world’s largest wealth manager surprised markets with a $774 million loss related to the collapse of the U.S. hedge fund. But the hit shouldn’t distract investors from the overall picture: The bank grew revenues, profits and assets under supervision, generating a healthy annualized return on tangible equity of 14%.<br />At first glance, UBS and Credit Suisse appear similar. Both combine a profitable Swiss universal bank with a sizable wealth management business that also provides clients with investment banking and asset management. UBS is only slightly larger in terms of total assets, $1.1 trillion versus $0.93 trillion.<br />Yet Credit Suisse has shown itself to be a riskier operator. This is clear from the numbers it reports as well as its disproportionate exposure to Archegos and other recent blowups.<br />Credit Suisse has higher “risk-weighted” assets, despite its smaller total assets, implying that those assets it does hold are deemed riskier by regulators. Moreover, Credit Suisse’s first-quarter “value-at-risk” or VAR—a metric that estimates the amount that could be lost in a given day—was $67 million, versus just $11 million for UBS. Admittedly, direct VAR comparisons are complicated by different calculation methods and confidence levels: UBS uses a 95% confidence level whereas Credit Suisse’s is 98%.</td>

Texas will gain two House seats, more than any other state. California will lose a congressional seat for the first time, though it still will have more House seats than any other state.<br />Every decade the Census Bureau releases population totals that determine how seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are reapportioned among the states.<br />States stand to gain or lose House seats based on how their populations have changed. Each state receives at least one seat.<br />The new numbers also will inform redistricting, a process of redrawing political boundaries that varies by state and takes into account the number of residents living within each district, plus the overseas federal employees and their dependents living with them who could be allocated to their home states. The Census Bureau will in August release demographic data to state legislatures and commissions, which run the redistricting process.<br />The changes are expected to favor Republicans because red-leaning states are gaining more seats on net, and because the GOP has more control in redrawing the new congressional maps. Republicans will be in charge of drawing new maps in 187 congressional districts this year, compared with 75 for Democrats, down from the GOP’s 219-44 advantage a decade ago, according to the Cook Political Report. Other states have redistricting processes governed by an independent commission, or only have one district for the entire state.</td>

Likewise, other property brokers surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect falls of between 5% and 10% for high-end rents in Central.<br />Already, rents have fallen steeply. In February, premium Central office rents went for the equivalent of about $12.70 a square foot a month, according to the most recent available government statistics, down 27% from the June 2019 peak.

Grads say they have sat through listless virtual ceremonies, filled out surveys about possible events and witnessed the Class of 2021 take to the stage before them. Schools say the pandemic makes it difficult to stick to promised plans, requiring in-person celebrations to be rescheduled again and again. Many 2020 grads have moved on and few fondly recall a final semester that fizzled out on Zoom instead of culminating in caps and gowns. Down the line, that could dim alumni loyalty and donations.<br />“There aren’t any perfect solutions,” says Lynn Pasquerella, president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities, a trade group. “With no handshakes and no hugs, it’s not going to be the experience that we hope for on college campuses.”<br />Higher-ed institutions also see commencements as a way to kindle alumni giving by creating that “institutional memory and sense of giving,” Dr. Pasquerella says. “The traditions that we have, including commencement, with its pomp and circumstance, are intended to create shared experiences that inspire people to give back.”</td>

The package-delivery giant on Tuesday posted revenue of $22.91 billion, up 27% from a year earlier and ahead of Wall Street expectations.<br />The company, like its rival  FedEx Corp. , has been handling a surge in e-commerce orders during the Covid-19 pandemic as customers shopped from home. U.S. revenue rose 22.3% to $14.01 billion in the quarter, while international revenue rose 36.2% to $4.61 billion, led by Asia and Europe.<br />Average daily volume rose 14.3%, the company said. UPS reported $4.29 billion in revenue for its supply chain and freight segment, up 34.3% from the prior year due to strong demand.<br />UPS reported a profit of $4.79 billion for the quarter, compared with $965 million in the comparable period last year.

      <td>Nomura’s Wall Street dream remains elusive as ever. Less grandiose—but more profitable—ambitions close to home might be a better use of the company’s resources and expertise.<br />The collapse of family investment firm Archegos last month was the latest setback to the Japanese bank’s ambitions to be a global investment bank: On Tuesday it reported 245.7 billion yen, the equivalent of $2.3 billion, of losses arising from the transactions with a U.S. client for last quarter. Nomura acted as a prime broker, lending money to trading clients, for the fund run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang.<br />The amount was less than the $5.5 billion lost by  Credit Suisse ,  but significantly more than the losses booked by other U.S. banks such as  Goldman Sachs ,  which moved fast to sell assets tied to Archegos.<br />The losses aren’t going to sink Nomura—it has ample capital supported by its strong domestic business—but they bring into question the bank’s decades of efforts to transform itself into a bulge-bracket Wall Street firm.<br />The Archegos disaster is only the latest episode of Nomura’s troubled journey abroad. The company had written down all the goodwill from its two iconic overseas expansions: the 2007 purchase of institutional broker Instinet, and its 2008 acquisition of Lehman Brothers’ Asian and European operations after the U.S. bank’s collapse.</td>

      <td>Bitcoin trading and regulatory credits, not auto sales, helped power Tesla to a record profit</td>
      <td>After just months under the same roof, bitcoin and Tesla are becoming the best of friends.<br />That is one takeaway from the car company’s first-quarter results out on Monday. Revenue of $10.4 billion and adjusted earnings of 93 cents a share both topped Wall Street expectations. Net income reached $438 million, a quarterly record for the company. What’s more, Tesla said it expects to increase vehicle deliveries by more than 50% this year from the 2020 total. That implies roughly 800,000 deliveries this year.<br />Tesla didn’t exactly earn its record profit from selling cars, however. The company said that it sold some of the $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin that it purchased in February, contributing $101 million to the bottom line. That is nearly a fourth of its total profit.<br />What is more, sales of regulatory credits to other auto makers to help them meet emissions mandates, which carry a 100% profit margin, reached $518 million. That accounts for nearly 100% of Tesla’s $533 million in pretax income. Those two helping hands helped avert red ink.<br />Shares traded slightly lower in after-hours trading on Monday, and the air has come ever so slightly out of Tesla’s stratospheric stock price. Shares are down about 16% from the peak in early January, but Tesla’s market value still tops $700 billion, or more than five times the combined value of  Ford  and  General Motors .  Ford sold more than half a million cars in the first quarter in the U.S., more than double Tesla’s world-wide total. If Tesla extended its first-quarter results for the next three quarters, the stock would trade at about 200 times this year’s adjusted earnings.</td>

Agencies will also need to incorporate it into existing contracts when they are extended.<br />The current minimum wage for workers performing work on covered federal contracts is $10.95.

DoorDash said it would offer varying degrees of marketing and product support based on the different fee levels.<br />Previously, restaurants didn’t have a choice. Delivery apps charged restaurants a cut of every order and set the rate. Some bigger chains used their scale to negotiate commissions as low as 15%. Many small restaurants paid up to 30% of every order.<br />Orders on major delivery apps boomed as shelter-in-place orders kept consumers at home and restaurant dining rooms closed. DoorDash now controls nearly half of the U.S. food-delivery market, up from a third before the pandemic.<br />Small-business owners bristled over the fees, blaming the apps for squeezing their already thin margins as the coronavirus pandemic raged. Regulators in several cities, including New York, San Francisco and Seattle, stepped in to cap what the apps could charge restaurants as a result.</td>

      <td>The Fed’s three-month currency swaps to other central banks cost nothing, prevented an emerging crisis and may have left markets healthier in the aftermath</td>
      <td>You may have missed it, but last week major central banks announced the coming end of a facility that provided hundreds of billions of dollars in international swaps, and prevented a calamitous dollar funding crisis last spring.<br />The Federal Reserve’s three-month currency swaps with other central banks will come to a close on July 1. Weekly operations with a seven-day maturity will continue. The central banks involved stressed that they could revive the longer-maturity facility if needed.<br />The program is a victim of its own success. More than $1 trillion was extended through it, split roughly equally over seven-day and three-month terms. At its peak, almost $450 billion was swapped, the lion’s share to banks in Japan and the eurozone. Today, the total runs to less than $1 billion.<br />The policy was free for the Fed. Every dollar extended has been returned, as was the case with swaps conducted in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. At a price of precisely nothing beyond the man-hours of organizing the swaps, its cost-benefit ratio has been off the charts.<br />There seem to have been positive knock-on effects beyond quelling panic. Cross-currency funding markets aren’t only more relaxed than during the market stress last year, but seem to be functioning better than they were even before that.</td>

As economies open back up and demand starts to recover, so too have prices, buoying major oil companies even as they increasingly face uncertainty about the outlook for their business as the world shifts to lower-carbon energy.<br />BP on Tuesday reported a replacement cost profit—a metric similar to the net income figure that U.S. oil companies report—of $3.32 billion for the three months ended March 31, from a loss of $628 million in the year-earlier period.<br />The company said solid earnings and income from asset sales helped it to lower its net debt to about $33 billion from $39 billion in the previous quarter. Encouraged by its progress, BP said it would buy back $500 million of shares in the second quarter.<br />“We’ve got a pretty optimistic outlook on buybacks for the remainder of the year but we’re going to do it quarter by quarter,” said BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney. “Depending of course on [the oil] price, I think next year you can very easily imagine a world where our distributions to shareholders are at or above the pre-pandemic levels.”</td>

Apps on Apple’s iOS platform must ask users’ permission to track them for advertising purposes.<br />When targeting users who have opted out of tracking, advertisers who buy ads through third-party platforms will have to wait three days for insights on their campaigns and will only receive aggregate information, such as the total number of users who took an action after an ad, people familiar with Apple’s ad products said.<br />Advertisers who buy Apple ad space can receive more data about user behavior, the people said.

Brands responded by shifting ad spending from print, television and in-store promotions to find customers across the Google universe.<br />Wall Street expects those trends to power Alphabet’s report on Tuesday, with analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipating first-quarter sales of about $51.51 billion and profit of $10.72 billion. The company posted $41.16 billion in revenue and $6.84 billion in profit during the year-earlier period, when advertising sales plunged as the coronavirus crisis crippled the global economy.<br />As the world’s digital ad leader, Google has been positioned to benefit from a broad wave of online ad growth sweeping across the economy. Smaller rival  Snap Inc.  last week reported a 66% increase in revenue on strong user growth and increased advertising, while  Verizon Communications Inc.  posted a 26% increase in ad sales.<br />The digital-spending surge has helped Google continue to deliver sales growth even as its share of the American search advertising market slips.

The government hasn’t said exactly how much it owes to Chinese lenders as a whole. Johns Hopkins University’s China-Africa Research Initiative estimates that Zambia has signed some $9.9 billion in loans from China, although not all of that money has been drawn.<br />But in January, Zambia’s state-owned mining company took on $1.5 billion in debt to take over a  Glencore  PLC copper mine, Mopani Copper Mines PLC, the latest in a string of moves that has remade the country into an exemplar of resource nationalism.<br />Zambia is the fourth-riskiest country on consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft’s Resource Nationalism Index, which assesses the risk to commodity producers from governments seeking greater control over their country’s mineral and energy deposits. Verisk Maplecroft said that the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has further encouraged government intervention in the mining sector.</td>

      <td>SINGAPORE—China’s largest distressed-asset manager paid off one of its international bonds in full on Tuesday and sought to assuage investor concerns about its liquidity following a credit-ratings downgrade.<br />The overseas arm of China Huarong Asset Management Co., a sprawling financial institution that helps the country’s commercial banks dispose of nonperforming loans, said it redeemed a four-year, 600 million Singapore dollar bond, equivalent to US$453 million, that matured on April 27. It was Huarong’s first international bond to come due since the company delayed the release of its financial results, which fueled concern that investors might not be repaid in full.<br />The state-backed company said it hasn’t defaulted on any international bonds and that the overseas unit’s operating condition has gradually improved and its liquidity is normal. The division also said it was profitable in the first quarter and has reversed losses incurred since 2018, thanks in part to steps it has taken to improve risk management and internal controls.<br />Beijing-based Huarong missed a deadline at the end of March to report its 2020 results—an event that sparked a steep selloff in its offshore bonds—and it didn’t provide any performance numbers on Tuesday. Huarong’s most recent earnings report was for the first half of last year, when the company said net income plunged 92% to the equivalent of $32 million on revenue of $7.1 billion<br />On Monday, Fitch Ratings lowered its investment-grade credit rating on Huarong by three notches from A to BBB and said a further cut could be in store. The ratings firm said the Chinese government hasn’t been as forthcoming in indicating its support for the state-owned asset manager during the recent selloff among its offshore bonds.</td>

      <td>Practice of funding home-state projects was shunned for a decade</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate will once again accept earmarks on a bipartisan basis for spending bills for the next fiscal year, with added measures to boost transparency and accountability, said the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.).<br />Earmarking allows lawmakers to direct federal agencies to spend specific amounts on projects in their home states or districts.<br />Under Mr. Leahy’s guidelines, senators’ earmarks—Mr. Leahy prefers the term “congressionally directed spending items”—will be subject to pre-existing rules that require senators to make any requests in writing and certify that they and their families don’t hold financial stakes in any of the projects for which they are seeking funding.<br />There are new restrictions as well. The money for earmarks will be capped at 1% of discretionary spending; funds are barred from going to for-profit entities; and senators are required to post their earmark requests online, along with their paperwork attesting that they and their relatives won’t benefit financially.<br />The change had been anticipated. House Democrats said earlier this year that they would revive earmarks, with new rules in place, and the House GOP voted last month in a secret ballot to allow them, as well. The Senate GOP dropped plans for a vote on earmarking behind closed doors last week, leaving their conference rule against them in place. But some Republican senators—including the top-ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama—have said they don’t consider the rule binding and plan to request earmarks anyway.</td>

      <td>Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has some good ideas, but Congress is the biggest obstacle to more significant reform.</td>
      <td>Democrats are again calling for Louis DeJoy’s head, so give the man some credit for sticking his neck out. If you’ve heard of Mr. DeJoy, the nation’s 75th Postmaster General, it’s probably because Democrats alleged last year that he was sabotaging the U.S. Postal Service to aid President Trump.<br />As soon as Mr. Trump lost the election, that false narrative vanished into the mists. Yet it’s not hard to see why Mr. DeJoy, new to the public eye, might prefer to lie low. Instead he’s out selling a 10-year plan to turn around the USPS, while taking incoming tomatoes all over again.<br />“We had no choice. We had to get moving. We lost $10 billion last year,” he says. “Our service standards were eroding and would continue to erode as mail volume came down.” Ron Bloom, chairman of the USPS’s board, agrees. “Over my career, I’ve been involved with a lot of companies who’ve died slowly,” he says. “And, bluntly, that’s what the Postal Service was doing.”<br />It’s the same killer that got  Blockbuster : the internet. Since 2006 total mail volume is down 39%. There’s less mail than in 1984. Yet the number of delivery points rises by more than a million a year. Put differently, the USPS says in 2006 there were 5.6 daily pieces of mail per delivery point. Last year: three. By 2030 the estimate is 1.7. The USPS is meant to be self-sufficient, but its losses since 2007 run to $87 billion, with $160 billion more projected this decade.<br />The question for the USPS is on what terms this will come to a stop. For now Congress has mandated six-day delivery. Universal service is also sacrosanct, so the USPS still runs mules to a village at the base of the Grand Canyon. Trying to make the Postal Service solvent, while coloring inside the lines drawn by Congress, is no easy feat.</td>

And he pleaded with the public to cooperate with police and identify miscreants: “Our job is to unmask them, arrest them, and prosecute them.”<br />Donald Trump? Sheriff Arpaio? Nope.<br />That was Portland, Ore., Mayor Ted Wheeler, the über-progressive, who made a national reputation last year by apologizing for vandals and rioters he said were merely exercising their right to protest against an unjust America. Now he’s had an epiphany, after his indulgence has made parts of Portland a battle zone.<br />Activists on the right and left have clashed in Portland’s streets, often violently, with few consequences since Mr. Wheeler was elected mayor in 2016. Rioting escalated after George Floyd’s death. But even as agitators shot fireworks at law enforcement, firebombed government buildings and set fire to cop cars and a police union hall, Mr. Wheeler directed police not to use CS gas for crowd control.<br />When the Trump Administration sent agents to defend federal property, Mr. Wheeler called it “an attack on our democracy” and blamed the feds for “increased violence and vandalism in our downtown core.” The fiscal 2021 budget slashed police funding by some $27 million.</td>

But even it disagrees with New Jersey’s slick argument in a case the Supreme Court will hear Wednesday that the Constitution gives states a veto over interstate gas pipelines that trumps federal regulatory and judicial review.<br />At issue in PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New Jersey is a 116-mile pipeline between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the pipeline after a two-year review that involved more than 200 meetings with public officials. Some 70 variations were made to the route during the review.<br />New Jersey sought to block the pipeline by invoking its sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to block the condemnation of 42 state parcels of land needed to build the pipeline.<br />Once FERC certifies a pipeline, the Natural Gas Act delegates the federal government’s eminent domain power to the pipeline company. Other federal laws delegate federal eminent domain power to private parties to build railroads and transmission lines, though many explicitly carve out state property. The Natural Gas Act has no such carve-out.<br />Yet New Jersey argues in the case now before the High Court that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits states from being sued by private parties in federal court. Ergo, PennEast Pipeline can’t use FERC’s eminent domain delegation to condemn state sovereign property in federal court.</td>

      <td>The opposition of market capitalism to state-oriented socialism and communism was the basic conflict in 20th-century political economy. But like many an economic and political theory, this durable model for delineating the possibilities—free markets vs. a “command economy”—cannot survive today’s Chinese state.<br />Capitalism and communism, opposed in ideology, turn out to be compatible in the real world. And perhaps the conceptual opposition is also collapsing in the West, as capitalism goes woke and sneaker commercials become indistinguishable from AOC campaign materials except by their production values.<br />“Leftism” as we know it crystallized in the 19th century largely under the aegis of Marxism, which described capitalism as an exploitative and murderous ideology that lionized greed. Leftists’ solution, as expressed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’s “The Communist Manifesto,” was government control of the economy under the “dictatorship of the proletariat.”<br />But the dictators turned out to be people rather than an abstract historical force, so it wasn’t a solution to human greed after all. Turning over all manufacturing and agriculture and trade to the party simply meant concentrating all the wealth and power in a few hands. It made the Soviet government, for example, a new oligarchy.<br />The Soviet oligarchy was little more effective than the czarist aristocracy it replaced. It didn’t learn enough, or quickly enough, from its capitalist rivals. It was terrible at marketing itself. Many Western analysts concluded that a command economy was unworkable, that the distance between government bureaucracy and real transactions made the economy unresponsive to changing conditions, unable to take advantage of opportunities, and unable to supply its population with what it actually needed.</td>

      <td>My legislation would protect free expression by treating Big Tech companies as common carriers.</td>
      <td>For too long Americans have watched Big Tech trample on the principles of the First Amendment—free speech, freedom of thought and belief, free assembly and the open exchange of ideas. As more information is filtered through online platforms, the First Amendment is becoming a dead letter. That’s why I’m taking action to hold these corporations accountable.<br />Today, I’m introducing the 21st Century Foundation for the Right to Express and Engage in Speech Act (or the 21st Century FREE Speech Act), which would restore the Bill of Rights—rather than the whims of big companies—as the guide for what Americans can say or hear in today’s public square.<br />The modern public square is dominated by ubiquitous platforms facing little meaningful competition. Instead of being accountable to consumers or voters, the companies that dominate communication today use opaque, inconsistent practices to control the information Americans get to see and discuss. As Justice Clarence Thomas noted in a recent Supreme Court opinion, common carriers—such as trains or phone networks, which are essential to everyday goings-on, connecting people and information—have historically been subject “to special regulations, including a general requirement to serve all comers” without discrimination. The same logic should apply today to Big Tech.<br />Unfortunately, our laws haven't kept pace with this technological reality. The statutes governing free speech and the free exchange of ideas online haven't been updated in a quarter-century. Since it was passed in 1996, Section 230 has been stretched from its original intent—the promotion of the free exchange of ideas online—into a license for companies like  Facebook  and  Twitter  to censor.<br />In recent months, these platforms have effectively smothered newspaper stories that they found inconvenient for their loudest users’ preferred candidates. Big Tech companies have silenced mainstream American political figures, while leaving up Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s account, even as he tweets hateful things, including calls to “eliminate Israel” and discussions of how to do so. These platforms have censored and editorialized with blatant political bias—writing progressive ideology into their content policies or scrubbing dissent against Covid lockdowns off their sites. Moderate and conservative viral content is suppressed. Twitter blocked the account of the New York Post over its reporting on Hunter Biden, while  Amazon  removed from its streaming service an acclaimed documentary on Justice Thomas during Black History Month. Implicit in these censorship practices is an apparent belief that Big Tech has the right to shape what Americans can learn and believe—a totalitarian concept that runs contrary to U.S. values.</td>

      <td>Marcus Aurelius was conﬁdent that goodness can be attained—that we can choose virtue, and avoid vice, with every decision we make.</td>
      <td>Consider the fortunes of Marcus Aurelius, ruler of Rome from A.D. 161 to 180 and follower of the Stoic ethical creed. He never meant to be a published author; the thoughts he set down, in Greek, were part of a purely personal self-improvement project. Someone, somehow, preserved the notebooks containing his loose assemblage of spiritual jottings. One day in the 17th century a clever translator, Méric Casaubon, gave the collection the title “Meditations,” and a bestseller was born.<br />Though it lacks structure and deploys, at times, arcane terms and concepts, “Meditations” has struck a chord with modern readers as few Greek or Roman texts have done, elevating its author to stardom—literally, given Richard Harris’s portrayal of a sober, sagacious Marcus in the hit 2000 film “Gladiator.”<br />Undoubtedly the work’s diaristic origins are a part of its appeal. Because Marcus is essentially talking to himself, his voice has remarkable authenticity. His readers can trust him for the simple reason that he’s unaware of their presence. Not even Augustine’s “Confessions,” notionally a conversation between the author and God, or Seneca’s “Moral Epistles,” an apparently private correspondence to which we are given access, can quite match the earnestness and integrity of a text that was never meant to be read at all.<br />Marcus’ life and times also contribute to the spell cast by “Meditations.” Thinkers since Plato have longed for a philosopher-king, a ruler able to wield great power while maintaining a strong moral core; Marcus seems to approximate that ideal. He came to the emperorship by adoption, the method employed by the Antonine emperors to anoint promising successors. His reign of nearly two decades was a success, the last phase of what Edward Gibbon dubbed the “most happy and prosperous” era of all human history. Marcus, however, ended that era when he broke with Antonine tradition and passed on rule to his natural son, Commodus, a cruel and selfish man (and, as modern moviegoers know, an amateur gladiator).<br />The degree to which “Meditations” has seized the modern imagination can be judged by the ever-increasing pace of new English-language versions. Amid this glut, the new edition by Robin Waterfield, a British classics scholar, has much to recommend it. The prose is wonderfully sober and taut, the choices felicitous. (“Command center,” Mr. Waterfield’s rendering of Marcus’ term for the rational, guiding mind, is an unfortunate exception.) The volume’s stand-out feature is its wide-ranging set of footnotes, offering assistance to novice readers, insights that will intrigue specialists, and reformulations that clarify Marcus’ thoughts. Thus the difficult “Meditations” entry, “Anything that doesn’t make a person worse in himself doesn’t make his life worse either, and does him no harm,” gets aptly reframed in Mr. Waterfield’s note as: “The only truly bad thing is moral vice; nothing else is truly harmful.”</td>

      <td>Where do rights fit into international solutions with nations like China or Russia?</td>
      <td>Ever since James Monroe instructed the European powers to keep their colonization efforts out of the Western Hemisphere, historians have looked for “doctrines,” the big ideas that guide presidents in their conduct of foreign policy. After last week’s virtual climate conference, political observers can begin to see the Biden doctrine will both clarify and complicate the tasks of U.S. foreign policy.<br />Simply put, the Biden doctrine holds that geopolitical competition must not be allowed to drive world history. Competition with China is real and must be vigorously pursued, but the essential goal of American foreign policy is to construct a values-based world order that can tackle humanity’s common problems in an organized and even collegial way.<br />This, Bidenites argue, is hardheaded realism. During the Cold War, self-interest—not starry-eyed idealism—kept American presidents and Soviet leaders from pushing the nuclear button, just as it was self-interest that led both sides to seek to limit their nuclear rivalry through arms control.<br />In the 21st century, problems like climate change, pandemics, financial regulation and cybersecurity simply cannot be solved by national governments acting alone. That reality, the new administration believes, forces world leaders to work together whether they like it or not. Global problems are so important, and the consequences of failing to address them so immediate, that countries have no choice but to cooperate. That cooperation reduces the scope and changes the nature of geopolitical competition. Just as the threat of nuclear destruction kept the Cold War cold, so threats like climate change and pandemics will limit international rivalries today.<br />Under these circumstances, Washington’s best response to geopolitical challenges from countries like China and Russia, Bidenites believe, is to change the subject. The U.S. can’t ignore the military and strategic facts of life, but order-building, not coup-counting, should be the goal. Even as America fends off Chinese and Russian efforts to undermine its global strategic position, Washington should constantly push the theme of common efforts to solve common problems.</td>

Far from showcasing its mighty influence on American life, the 93rd Academy Awards confirmed that our movie industry no longer even knows how to entertain.<br />Start with the inexplicable decision to dispense with clips from nominated films in favor of more time for presenters and winners to drone on about whatever they had on their minds. From actress-director Regina King’s opening remarks about the Derek Chauvin verdict in Minneapolis to the later reference to police killings and the themes represented by the films nominated for best picture (#MeToo feminism, 1960s black militancy, the plight of an Amazon worker, etc.), it had all the glamour and appeal of a public-television fundraiser. It’s not that this year’s Oscars were too political. It’s that they were too boring.<br />Bill Maher called it. Two weeks before the Oscars aired, the HBO host of “Real Time with Bill Maher” said that after a year of Covid-19, he had hoped for a little Hollywood escapism. But “judging by this year’s best-picture nominees,” he said, “you couldn’t have a worse time at the movies if there was an active shooter in the theater.”<br />Here’s his summary of the contenders, starting with “Nomadland,” which took home the award for best picture:<br />“That’s the one about the woman who winds up living in her van after her husband dies of cancer. In ‘Judas and the Black Messiah,’ the FBI kills the leader of the Black Panthers, and in ‘The Trial of the Chicago 7’ the FBI kills the leader of the Black Panthers again. ‘Promising Young Woman’ has Carey Mulligan avenging a murderous rapist, but then he kills her too. . . . ‘The Sound Of Metal’ is about a musician going deaf. ‘The Father’ is about an octogenarian descending into dementia. And ‘Minari’ is the story of dirt-poor Korean immigrants in Arkansas who put all their food in a barn, but then grandma has a stroke and burns it down. Now enjoy the show!”</td>

      <td>An archaic regulatory process that depends on placebo trials is blocking access to new drugs.</td>
      <td>It’s hard to process what the doctor is saying: You have a disease that will rapidly paralyze you until it eventually suffocates you to death. But you are one of the lucky ones: You qualify for a clinical trial of a promising experimental drug. There is a 30% to 50% chance of receiving a placebo instead of the experimental therapy. A placebo is necessary, you learn, because each person with your disease is so different, and there are no objective measures to predict the course of your disease. Still, you are grateful to qualify for the trial; most patients don’t.<br />Fortunately, the trial has a design that is friendly to patients, and so six months later, after the randomized portion is complete, all patients may receive the real drug as part of what’s called an “open label extension.” Without this, you may only get the placebo. And the access to the real drug may end once the trial is complete, even if it was helping you.<br />My husband, Mike Cimbura, was one of the 36 participants who received the drug NurOwn in a Phase 2 clinical trial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mike regained some function, but he was able to get only one dose before the trial ended. Mike and I fought for continued access to treatment and to improve an archaic regulatory pathway. He died waiting for change in 2019.<br />Promising therapies are on the horizon for ALS, but most people with the disease won’t live to see them. Most patients die within two to five years of diagnosis. These patients need more access to promising therapies and a more flexible regulatory process that would accommodate the moderate advances needed to get closer to a cure.<br />In September 2019, the Food and Drug Administration put out new guidance on developing drugs for ALS, thought to be a step toward modernizing development. The agency says that during development “sponsors should collect safety data, including data from open-label studies or expanded access programs, from patients across the spectrum of disease stages and severities.” The agency reiterated its support for regulatory flexibility when applying standards to drugs for diseases with serious unmet medical needs.</td>

      <td>The Justices might finally stop lower-court judges from hollowing out the landmark Heller ruling.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court has been gun-shy for more than a decade, so its decision on Monday to take a firearms case from New York is welcome news. The Justices have a chance to correct the lower-court judges who are trying to make the Second Amendment an empty right that ends at the gun owner’s front door.<br />New York bans openly carrying a handgun. Concealed carrying is allowed with a license, but to get one the general public must show “proper cause.” That means some “special need for self-protection,” and living or working in a high-crime area doesn’t count. “The state makes it virtually impossible for the ordinary law-abiding citizen to obtain a license,” say the petitioners in New York State Rifle and Pistol Assn. v. Corlett.<br />This is difficult to square with the Second Amendment, which protects “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms.” But the Supreme Court’s absenteeism on gun rights has left other judges in charge. Justice Antonin Scalia’s 2008 landmark opinion in D.C. v. Hellerrecognized an individual right to own guns in common use, specifically but not solely at home. McDonald v. Chicago in 2010 made that enforceable on the states. Since then? Crickets.<br />The result has been a circuit-court chasm, as liberal judges hollow out the Second Amendment. Last month the Ninth Circuit said: “There is no right to carry arms openly in public; nor is any such right within the scope of the Second Amendment.” That supplements the Ninth Circuit’s ruling five years ago: “There is no Second Amendment right for members of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public.” No open carry; no concealed carry: This is the enfeebled status of an enumerated right in a judicial circuit that covers nine states and 67 million Americans.<br />Why the Supreme Court has let such shenanigans continue for so long is unknown. Our informed view is that the conservative wing has feared that former Justice Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts might prove unreliable on the question. Some impatience has seeped out in dissents to denials of hearing petitions. “As evidenced by our continued inaction in this area,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in 2018, “the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this Court.”</td>

      <td><br /><br /><br /><br />Dawn Richard began her professional life in music as part of the industry machine but now occupies a space all her own. The 37-year-old singer-songwriter grew up in New Orleans, the daughter of a musician—her father, Frank, was the lead singer in the funk band Chocolate Milk, active in the 1970s and early ’80s—and a dance teacher, and in 2005 she was selected to be on “Making the Band,” a reality series starring producer and record executive Sean “Diddy” Combs. She became a member of Danity Kane, the quintet that emerged from the show, and the girl group put out two chart-topping LPs in the late 2000s. And Ms. Richard was prominently featured on another project helmed by Mr. Combs, the 2010 album “Last Train to Paris,” which hit the top 10 and garnered critical notice for its lustrous mix of rap, R&B and pulsing European club music. After making an impact on television and the charts and having worked closely with a famous pop mogul, Ms. Richard seemed positioned for a career on a major label. But she took a different path.</td>

      <td>A 16-CD boxed set celebrates a 20th-century Polish conductor who reinvigorated the music of composers from Brahms to Gershwin and was, for a time, the premier orchestra builder in the U.S.</td>
      <td><br />If the name Artur Rodzinski means little to music lovers today, that’s because time and more media-savvy maestros have eclipsed his fame. But from the 1930s till his death in 1958, this Polish conductor had the respect not just of audiences, but also of musicians, including his peers on the podium. Now one of his great contributions to American musical life—his directorship of the New York Philharmonic in the mid-1940s—is being celebrated thanks to a new compilation of recordings. Titled “Artur Rodzinski—New York Philharmonic: The Complete Columbia Album Collection,” the box of 16 CDs from Sony Classical also contains material from several years later with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, but not, alas, Rodzinski’s earlier Columbia recordings with the Cleveland Orchestra nor his later records with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on RCA.<br />Rodzinski (pronounced roh-JIN-skee), the son of an army medical officer, was born in 1892 in the Dalmatian city of Split, then part of the Habsburg Empire. His studies eventually took him to Vienna, where he trained under such musical luminaries as the composer Franz Schreker, the conductor Franz Schalk and the pianist Emil von Sauer. Leopold Stokowski spotted his talent and appointed him his assistant at the Philadelphia Orchestra, where the younger conductor’s fame quickly grew. Posts in Los Angeles and Cleveland soon cemented his standing as this country’s pre-eminent orchestra builder, with him laying the groundwork on which others erected, or at least burnished, their reputations.<br />A peak in this regard came in 1937, when Arturo Toscanini chose him to select and train the members of the radio orchestra that NBC was creating in New York for the venerable Italian maestro. So when the New York Philharmonic (then styled as the Philharmonic-Symphony Society of New York) needed a new chief conductor, Rodzinski seemed an obvious choice. A longstanding commitment to opera in concert and new music, along with his mastery of wide swaths of the canon, left little, if anything, beyond his reach.<br />Yet great talent sometimes breeds great conflict—or so it was with Rodzinski’s perfectionist tendencies and artistic ambitions. He was the first to carry the title of music director at the Philharmonic and summarily dismissed 14 players. (He was also, almost certainly, the last to carry a loaded pistol to performances!) But he was unskilled at playing musical politics, and his abbreviated tenure, from 1943 to 1947, was the subject of a harsh Time magazine cover story.</td>

It will also seek to determine whether officers use excessive force, discriminate based on race and engage in unconstitutional stops, arrests and seizures.<br />“Investigators will seek input from every corner of Louisville,” Mr. Garland said.<br />It is the second such probe the Justice Department has launched in a week, as the agency takes a more active role in overhauling local police agencies.<br />Mr. Garland on Wednesday said the department would examine whether Minneapolis police engage in excessive force and discriminatory practices, a day after a state jury convicted Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd, whose killing, following Ms. Taylor’s, touched off nationwide protests over policing and racial injustice.</td>

The remaining $350 million will be paid in cash over a five-year-period.<br />Lyft’s departure from building self-driving cars follows rival  Uber Technologies Inc.’s  decision to shed its autonomous-driving division late last year. The money-losing companies overhauled their businesses during the coronavirus pandemic and pledged to scale back on costly ventures as the health crisis crushed their core rides operations.<br />Lyft said the sale would help it save $100 million in operating expenses, accelerating its path to profitability. The company said it now expects to become profitable on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the third quarter. Previously, it expected to reach that milestone in the fourth quarter, alongside Uber.<br />Lyft’s shares rose nearly 3% in after-hours trading Monday.</td>

      <td>The first results of the 2020 census show that political power will shift even more to states in the South and Mountain West, and that population growth slowed to almost the lowest rate in U.S. history.<br />Thirteen states will gain or lose seats in the House of Representatives in next year’s elections through the once-a-decade reapportionment required by the Constitution. They will also lose or gain votes in the Electoral College beginning in 2024. Texas will gain two seats in the House. Five states will gain one each: Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon. Seven states will lose one each: California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The allocation is based on a formula set in a 1941 law.<br />The changes are expected to favor Republicans because red-leaning states are gaining more seats on net, and because the GOP has more control in redrawing the new congressional maps.<br />The U.S. population grew 7.4% in the last decade, according to the Census Bureau. The population reached 331,449,281 last April 1.<br />The electoral shifts reflect the decade’s broad population shifts: slow growth in the Northeast and Midwest and gains in the South and Mountain West. The South grew 10.2%, more than twice the rate of the Northeast or the Midwest. U.S. growth fell from 9.7% in the previous decade and was the slowest since a gain of 7.3% in the 1930s, during the Great Depression.</td>
