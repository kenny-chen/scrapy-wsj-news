      <td>The former president’s efforts were dropped after top DOJ officials agreed to resign en masse in protest if he succeeded, people familiar said</td>
      <td>In his last weeks in office, former President Donald Trump considered replacing the acting attorney general with another official who would be more amenable to pursuing unproven claims of election fraud, people familiar with the matter said.<br />The plan was stymied when the Justice Department’s top leaders agreed on a conference call in early January that they would resign en masse if Mr. Trump fired then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, the people said, averting what could have become a new crisis in the administration’s waning days.<br />In Mr. Rosen’s place, Mr. Trump had considered installing another senior Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, who had expressed a willingness to use the department’s power to help the former president continue his unsuccessful legal battles contesting the election results, these people said.<br />Mr. Clark denied involvement in a plan to oust Mr. Rosen, which was first reported by the New York Times.<br />“My practice is to rely on sworn testimony to assess disputed factual claims,” Mr. Clark said in a statement sent to The Wall Street Journal after the publication of the story in the Times. “There were no ‘maneuver[s].’ There was a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president. It is unfortunate that those who were part of a privileged legal conversation would comment in public about such internal deliberations, while also distorting any discussions.…Observing legal privileges, which I will adhere to even if others will not, prevents me from divulging specifics regarding the conversation.”</td>

      <td>Lawmakers in both parties say a comprehensive bill would hit hurdles, but a narrower deal centered on Dreamers might be possible</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden is making an early bet that after years of stalemate, the moment for comprehensive immigration reform has arrived. But lawmakers in both parties caution that Mr. Biden’s effort is likely to face some of the same headwinds the plans of the last three presidents did.<br />On his first day in office, Mr. Biden proposed a broad immigration bill that would create an eight-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants living in the country without a permanent legal status. It would have an expedited pathway for farmworkers and the young immigrants known as Dreamers, along with changes to the legal immigration, refugee and asylum systems. It proposes adding more technology to monitor people and drugs at the border—though no new barriers—along with $4 billion in aid to Central American countries to help stem the extreme poverty and gang violence that has prompted so many migrants to leave.<br />Unlike previous compromise bills, Mr. Biden’s proposal lacks the countermeasures of increased security or deterrence at the border that Republicans have asked for in exchange for legalization.<br />Some Democrats say they can rally around an immigration reform package that makes no concessions. But the approach is likely to quickly run into opposition from Senate Republicans, at least 10 of whom would need to support a measure for it to clear the Senate’s 60-vote hurdle for most legislation.<br />Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), the bill’s Senate sponsor, told a conference of the American Business Immigration Council on Thursday that enacting the bill would be a “herculean task,” and could prove impossible without Republican cooperation. But, he said, Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are strongly supportive of the effort.</td>

      <td>Scams targeting older adults take many forms, ranging from callers posing as grandchildren in need of financial assistance to emails directing people to fake bank websites where cons collect login credentials. The techniques evolve every year but the outcome is always the same: Many seniors end up losing money.<br />The isolation many older adults are experiencing during the pandemic has exacerbated the problem. Technology helps seniors stay connected with loved ones during a time of limited social interactions but it also opens new doors to scammers. Online puppy scams and romance scams are on the rise as bad actors seek to take advantage of people’s loneliness, according to the National Adult Protective Services Association.<br />Scammers initiated contact with older adults online more often than they did by phone for the first time ever in the second quarter of 2020, according to an October report from the Federal Trade Commission. Phone scams, though, still resulted in the highest monetary losses.<br />Older adults, defined by the FTC as those age 60 and over, were nearly six times as likely as younger ones to report losing money on tech-support scams. In all, older Americans reported fraud losses totaling $388 million through the third quarter of 2020, the latest data available from the FTC, up 23% from the same period a year earlier.<br />There are ways to safeguard assets and to prevent such scams from occurring in the first place. Here are some tips, based on interviews with several elder-care experts.</td>

      <td>Drugmaker say early supplies could lag projections by as much as 60% in a worst-case scenario</td>
      <td>AstraZeneca  PLC expects to deliver tens of millions fewer Covid-19 vaccine doses than planned to the European Union in coming months, according to people familiar with the matter, threatening the continent’s plans to ramp up vaccinations and delivering a fresh reputational blow to the drugmaker.<br />AstraZeneca disclosed the shortfall late Friday after briefing European officials earlier in the day. It blamed a manufacturing issue in Europe, but didn’t disclose the magnitude of the shortfall.<br />According to people familiar with the matter, the company told European officials that in a worst-case scenario AstraZeneca may be able to provide only around 30 million of roughly 80 million doses EU countries had anticipated for February and March, a roughly 60% decline from the company’s earlier estimates. AstraZeneca is working to significantly reduce that potential shortfall and says the roughly 30 million doses is the minimum it should be able to deliver, these people said.<br />The root cause of the problem is a manufacturing facility in Belgium owned by Novasep Holding SAS that has been unable to make as much bulk vaccine as projected, the people said. The facility’s so-called yield, or the amount of vaccine it can make from base ingredients, is running at about a third of AstraZeneca’s expectations, one of the people said. Novasep didn’t respond to requests for comment Saturday.<br />Vaccine yields can vary widely depending on “seeding” steps, taken over weeks, to grow cells needed to make the vaccine and later-stage processes to filter and purify the substance before it is packed into vials. AstraZeneca has found yields varying among its many manufacturing partners and has been working to boost production where it is lagging, the person said. The process is labor- and time-intensive. Reuters first reported the number of doses AstraZeneca may no longer be able to deliver.</td>

      <td>A century after playwright Karel Čapek coined the word ‘robot,’ we finally have the technology to make the stuff of science fiction a reality—for better and for worse</td>
      <td>On Jan. 25, 1921, Karel Čapek’s play “R.U.R.”—short for “Rossum’s Universal Robots”—premiered in Prague. It was a sensation. Within two years it had been translated into 30 languages, including English, to which it introduced the word “robot.” Čapek’s vision of unwilling slaves of humanity destined to rise up and destroy their makers has shaped our view of both automation and ourselves ever since.<br />In a century-long dialogue between inventors of fictional and actual robots, engineers have for the most part been forced to play catch-up, either realizing or subverting the vision of robots first expounded in books, movies and television.<br />Now, the reality of robots is in some areas running ahead of fiction, even ahead of what those who study robots for a living are able to keep track of.<br />Heather Knight is an engineer, “social roboticist” and one of 13 core faculty in Oregon State University’s robotics program. One day in late October, she was shocked to find the campus crawling with a fleet of autonomous, six-wheeled vehicles made by Starship Robotics. The San Francisco-based company had contracted with the campus dining service to provide contactless delivery.<br />“We’re at the point where not even the people in robotics know there are going to be robots on campus,” she adds.</td>

      <td>GROWING UP in Florida, Edouardo Jordan was raised on his grandmother’s cooking: neck bones and rice, stews, creamy yams, black-eyed peas, shrimp purloo. He knew that this repertoire was the bread and butter of her native Georgia, but he wasn’t aware how much of it originated in West Africa.<br />Two years and thousands of dollars spent on culinary school didn’t change that. Mr. Jordan went on to work for more than a decade in some of the country’s most celebrated kitchens—the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif., Per Se and Lincoln in New York City—before striking out on his own in 2015 with a contemporary American restaurant, Salare, in Seattle. At last he began digging into the roots of the Southern food he grew up on and the rich culinary traditions of Africa—a vision Mr. Jordan more fully realized when he opened JuneBaby, an ode to the food of his youth, in 2017.<br />Mr. Jordan is one of a growing number of Black chefs and food entrepreneurs today raising the profile of African and Afro-Caribbean flavors and dishes in a country that has long given them short shrift.<br />From the start, diners at Salare found a menu imbued with African influences, from Ethiopian spice mixes like berbere and mitmita to pikliz, the Haitian pickled slaw. Last August, in the wake of the pandemic, Mr. Jordan went all in, dedicating the whole restaurant to an exploration of how forced migration from Africa has influenced the foodways of places like Haiti and Brazil. (Since August Salare has been open for takeout only.) “I now had the opportunity to explore, express, really represent where I came from and what I knew as Black food,” Mr. Jordan said.<br />At Compère Lapin, in New Orleans, Nina Compton serves flavors of her native Saint Lucia in dishes like conch croquettes and cow heel soup, run through with French, Creole and Italian influences as well. Kwame Onwuachi rose to national acclaim after opening Kith/Kin in 2017 in Washington, D.C.; star dishes included West African jollof rice, Trinidadian goat roti and Ethiopian sambusas (savory pastries filled with spiced lamb). The restaurant closed last year, but Mr. Onwuachi vows that future ventures will center on the same themes. In 2018, television viewers received a crash course in West African foodways when, as a contestant on Bravo’s “Top Chef,” Eric Adjepong wowed judges with the likes of nutty, spicy egusi soup, the rice and bean dish waakye, and fufu, a doughy dumpling made from cassava and plantain flour—staple dishes in Ghana, where Mr. Adjepong’s parents were born and raised.</td>

They’re also the last team to start the abbreviated 2021 season, this time because over two-thirds of the roster tested positive for Covid-19 upon returning for training camp.<br />Dallas rescheduled its first four games of the season, which began on Jan. 13 for the rest of the league, and played its first game on Friday night against the Nashville Predators, a 7-0 shutout victory.<br />It was a weird puck drop for the reigning Western Conference champions, made even more unusual by the circumstances of its start. The team with the NHL’s biggest Covid-19 outbreak to date is also one of just three hockey franchises welcoming fans into the rink as new coronavirus infections spike and many municipalities tighten already strict public health restrictions. For Friday’s opener, 4,214 people were in attendance<br />“At this point with the manifest, we don’t have enough seats for the people that want to come,” said Stars president and chief executive officer Brad Alberts. “We’ve gotten an overwhelming response of people that want to come to our games.”<br />Health protocols in Texas cap attendance at 50% for professional sporting events, both indoor and outdoor. The Stars, however, are keeping crowds a hair under 5,000–about 27% of the American Airlines Center’s 18,532 seats.</td>

      <td>As Congress weighs another round of direct payments to households, advocates see a continuing role for periodic cash from Washington</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Lawmakers approved stimulus checks last March as an intentionally scattershot move to flood households with cash when the course of the pandemic and economy were uncertain. Now, as Congress and President Biden pursue a third round of payments, the economic case for them is shifting.<br />A policy once viewed partly as a bridge until relief could be more carefully targeted became a recurring backstop to other programs during a bumpy recovery. Despite concerns from some Republicans and a few Democrats about giving money to people who don’t need it, many members of Congress now view the checks as an essential element of future relief legislation.<br />The checks’ broad appeal stems from their near-universality, simplicity and speed, and they may become a more routine government response to future recessions.<br />Though many payments would go to employed workers likely to save the money until after the pandemic, lawmakers defend that feature as necessary to fill gaps in social-spending programs. Unemployment insurance doesn’t cover everyone who lost a job or suffered an income decline, and some households faced long delays as states processed claims.<br />“The people that we want to help, some of them, many of them, millions of them, are not getting help,” said Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist who has studied stimulus payments and their impact.</td>

Snap Inc.  is expanding in promising new directions.<br />Social-media stocks have all soared over the past year as the Covid-19 pandemic has forced the world to communicate virtually, but Snap’s performance stands out. Its shares have more than doubled over the past four months, besting both  Twitter  and  Facebook  during the news-heavy election season and even outshining  Pinterest ,  which has blossomed into an e-commerce destination with nearly perfect timing.<br />Snap’s extraordinary run suggests that investors are valuing future potential over current performance. Wall Street expects Snap to have boosted revenue at roughly the same rate as Pinterest in 2020 and its monthly users at roughly half the rate. Snap is now trading at a sizable premium to Pinterest at 22 times forward sales—a level it hasn’t seen since its initial public offering back in 2017.<br />Snap has been working to enhance its appeal to businesses beyond traditional social-media advertising. That potential seems to be coming into focus now with analysts increasingly eyeing the company’s innovation pipeline, which MKM Partners’ Rohit Kulkarni calls the best in social media.<br />Snap said it has launched 15 different products and functionalities using augmented reality for businesses in just the first nine months of last year. A new marketing video released by Snap in December shows how Snapchatters can now virtually try on products such as shoes or nail polish. It also shows how users can physically scan a product’s logo to view information about it, including a tutorial on how to use it.</td>

In addition, though, agents of several mutual life insurance companies—those owned by their policyholders, not shareholders—must generate a minimum amount of sales to qualify for subsidized health insurance and other medical benefits.<br />People selling financial products can be expected to consider the link between sales and the cost of their benefits when they make recommendations, consumer advocates say.<br />“These types of arrangements at their core present conflicts that are bad for the consumer,” said David Certner, legislative counsel at AARP, the nonprofit advocacy group for people 50 years and older.<br />Some financial advisers at Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. have also complained. In internal online forums that allow agents and advisers to opine on the company’s benefits policies, at least six agents wrote that linking the cost of their health benefits to how much they sell of certain products creates a difficult conflict for them, according to copies of the posts reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—Thousands of people across Russia took to the streets in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, in what has shaped up to be a key test for his movement and a fresh challenge for the Kremlin.<br />Police in riot gear detained hundreds of protesters during the unsanctioned rallies in dozens of Russian cities on Saturday, including the capital Moscow, according to independent monitors. Mr. Navalny, who was detained on Sunday upon his return to Russia from Germany following a near-fatal poisoning with a nerve agent, had called for protests and organizers said they expected rallies in more than 60 cities across Russia’s 11 time zones.<br />For Mr. Navalny, who has shown an ability to mobilize his large following into demonstrations, Saturday’s protests are a new test of his clout after being out of the country for five months, while supporters are facing freezing temperatures and increasing pressure from authorities. The strength and sustainability of the rallies would be an indication whether his movement can grow even as he is facing a potentially yearslong prison sentence, analysts say.<br />The rallies are the latest against President Vladimir Putin’s government following demonstrations in recent years against declining political freedoms and stagnating living standards. Observers say that the major concern for the Kremlin is whether the rallies could grow into a long-term display of resistance and attract more people ahead of this year’s parliamentary election.<br />“The protests are a vivid headache” for many in the ruling elite, said Konstantin Gaaze, a Moscow-based political analyst and former government adviser. “And for Navalny, it’s all in, he has nothing else but the menace of street protests.”</td>

Israel has approved the vaccine for anyone over 16. It won’t inoculate anyone under that age.<br />Ministry of Health data show that Israel’s younger population is far more likely to test positive for the coronavirus, with 10- to 19-year-olds making up 21% of known infections. The 20- to 29-year-old age group accounts for 19% of known infections.<br />“They are the megaspreaders,” Ido Hadari, director of government relations at Israel’s Maccabi Healthcare Services said of high-school students. “If we vaccinate these guys they will stop being spreaders.”<br />Israel is leading the world’s fastest vaccination campaign, so far administering the first dose of the  Pfizer Inc.  vaccine to almost 30% of its population since starting in late December. Israel has also received some shipments of the  Moderna Inc.  vaccine, but so far is mainly relying on Pfizer.</td>

      <td>Celebrities have contributed to a rise in the popularity of plant-based diets, but finding stylish vegan shoes is still challenging. Here are the innovators in this growing market</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a thrice-monthly column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />LEATHER SHOES are so widespread that most of us don’t give them a second thought. Animal skin has been the dominant footwear material since the early Mesopotamian civilization, despite some notable exceptions—ranging from silver and gold sandals in ancient Rome to mother-of-pearl shoes in 18th-century France. Leather is ideal for footwear: It’s comfortable, durable and readily available. Though the global population currently includes hundreds of millions of vegetarians, many still regularly lace up smooth leather Nike Air Jordans, pop on sheepskin Ugg boots and slip into pairs of smooth calfskin pumps.<br />But veganism, a stricter kind of vegetarianism that prohibits animal by-products and is usually linked to environmental concerns, is on the rise, and with it, a demand for stylish vegan shoes. “Vegan,” like “sustainable,” is a word annoyingly open to interpretation, but a vegan shoe is usually defined as one crafted neither from leather nor silk, cashmere, shearling or any other fauna-derived substances. Bonus points for shoes that use recycled materials or are biodegradable. Even shoes that appear vegan, such as fabric flats, can be lined in thin leather, or bound with animal-collagen glue.<br />Vegan shoes can be made of synthetic blends or a host of other experimental, plant-based materials such as corn derivatives, wood, mushrooms, hemp, cotton, cork, pineapple and bacteria. Yes, the kind of bacteria that gave us kombucha can be transformed into vegan shoe “leather.”<br />While these strictures might sound extreme to your average Joe, they’re being increasingly adopted. Consumer analyst Carmen Bryan of GlobalData said that the percentage of Americans “aligning with vegan diets...shot up” from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020. She explained, “This has been driven by increased awareness of individual carbon footprints, environmental concerns and the impact healthy eating has on one’s mental health. The pandemic, especially in the early months, forced many U.S. citizens to slow down and reassess their priorities, leading to radical lifestyle changes.”</td>

      <td>At the Clark Art Institute, six new outdoor works engage with the museum’s 140-acre campus.</td>
      <td>Williamstown, Mass.<br />As the pandemic compels us to take our culture al fresco, outdoor sculpture is having its day in the sun. The next day, however, might be partly cloudy. And the next might bring a frost with the chance of freezing rain. In other words the outdoors, unlike the white cube of a gallery, can challenge sculpture itself as much as the scenery compels us as viewers.<br />When the Clark Art Institute looked to bring art into the wilds of its own backyard in Williamstown, Mass., the muddy, icy, windswept challenges of a New England hillside called Stone Hill suggested an opportunity to do something different with sculpture than just display art plopped in a plaza, as we often encounter such outdoor work. An exhibition called “Ground/Work,” organized by guest curators Molly Epstein and Abigail Ross Goodman and on view through Oct. 17, now presents six commissioned pieces by six contemporary artists (all created last year) scattered around a 140-acre woodland pasture. This landscape with trails that rise several hundred feet and connect with a larger conservation area means visitors should be prepared for more than a walk in the sculpture park.<br />As an institution best known for its collection of 19th-century European and American art, the Clark is wise to use this outdoor space to bring contemporary voices and its natural assets into the mix. Through a language of reserved modernist form, each of these new works is designed to engage with the weather and the vistas, the birds and cows, all in “active dialogue,” according to exhibition literature, with this specific environment. It’s just too bad we need a field guide to some of the works in order to understand the overwrought concepts behind their creation.<br />You could easily miss the first work on view, which is embedded in the museum architecture itself. Jennie C. Jones has attached a 16-foot sculpture of powder-coated aluminum, wood and harp strings to the end of a free-standing wall. Called “These (Mournful) Shores,” the work is an Aeolian harp, meant to be strummed by the wind, that, according to the label, refers to the Middle Passage. It’s an elegiac idea but with layers of conceptual meaning that muddy the effect. Its dark gray palette, meant to recall that of two seascapes by Winslow Homer in the Clark collection, further mutes what should be a more resonant work.</td>

A public defender representing Mr. Fracker declined to comment. On Facebook, the Marine Corps veteran said he did nothing illegal. “I can protest for what I believe in and still support your protest for what you believe in. I fought for your right to do it,” he wrote in a Facebook post after the riot, according to the complaint.<br />Mr. Robertson couldn’t be reached for comment. He posted the photo on Instagram and said he was proud of it, according to a federal complaint.<br />A spokesman for the Virginia National Guard, which deployed to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 7, said it would investigate the matter. Rocky Mount’s town manager said Messrs. Fracker and Robertson have been put on administrative leave while officials review the case.<br />As total federal arrests in the Capitol riot grow past 100, Mr. Fracker is one of at least 18 current and former police officers, firefighters and military members who have been charged as of Friday, according to a Wall Street Journal tally. They include a retired Pennsylvania firefighter accused of throwing a fire extinguisher at Capitol police and a Navy veteran who calls himself the QAnon Shaman.

In response, deaths are now getting counted faster than ever, potentially giving public-health experts and policy makers a clearer picture to make decisions.<br />Weeks after the virus hit Italy last year, doctors, funeral homes and officials realized that government Covid-19 death tolls were too low and many victims weren’t getting included. Informal tallies quickly revealed that thousands of deaths most likely caused by the virus had been omitted. Limited testing left the number of infections unknown, and many people had died outside hospitals, which were the initial source of fatality figures.<br />Italy’s statistical agency, Istat, scrambled to assemble more reliable information, collecting data from towns and cities faster than ever before. In May, it revealed what people at the front lines had suspected: a 39% jump in nationwide deaths between Feb. 21 and March 31 compared with previous years.<br />“Normally, they [the data] would have arrived six months later,” said Istat President Gian Carlo Blangiardo in May. “We made an extraordinary effort.”<br />Authorities across Europe and the U.S. soon followed Italy’s race for information on deaths. Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, in April for the first time collected and published weekly death data for 31 countries, it said, “to support the policy and research efforts related to Covid-19.” The same month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the first time began publishing weekly national death data.</td>

The company said Tuesday it topped 200 million paying customers for the first time after adding a record 37 million in 2020. The streaming giant’s continued growth comes in the midst of heightened competition from tech giants and media conglomerates. A new rival,  ViacomCBS Inc.’s  Paramount+, is slated to launch in March and will exploit a key advantage media companies have over their tech competitors: cross-promotion. Netflix shares surged 17% Wednesday.<br />Microsoft Corp.<br />Microsoft is betting big on driverless cars. The software giant on Tuesday joined a group of companies that will invest more than $2 billion in General Motors Co.’s driverless-car startup, Cruise. Under the terms of the deal, Cruise will use Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing platform to help it roll out autonomous-vehicle services. GM said Microsoft would be its preferred cloud provider and help it streamline supply chains and roll out new digital services to customers. In recent years, the tech giant has been aggressively pushing its cloud-computing business, where it rents server capacity and software tools to customers.

New chip-making incentives were included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed in January, although the measures have yet to receive funding.<br />Samsung’s proposed plant would employ up to 1,900 people and aims to be operational by October of 2022, according to correspondence viewed by The Wall Street Journal between Samsung and the city manager of Goodyear, Ariz., one of the places the company is considering. As is customary with large industrial projects, the local Goodyear authorities are offering a range of incentives, including tax breaks and infrastructure upgrades to lure the factory, according to the letter.</td>

      <td>Those wrists. Other hitters always talked about the strength in those wrists and forearms as they whipped a bat through the strike zone. What a sight as they knocked another pitch for a line-drive base hit or an arcing shot into the bleachers. Few—maybe no one else—could swing a baseball bat like Henry “Hank” Aaron, who died this week at age 86.<br />Aaron is best known for breaking Babe Ruth’s major-league home run record on April 8, 1974. But readers of a certain age remember him as one of the greatest overall hitters of all time. Year after year he was among the leaders in batting average, runs batted in and home runs.<br />He did it in the era when the pitcher’s mound was higher and pitching was dominant. He also did it before the era of steroid use that pumped up the stats of many players who wouldn’t have hit 20 dingers a year in the days of Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson. That isn’t nostalgia talking. It’s physics and biology.<br />Aaron’s record of 755 career home runs was surpassed more than three decades later by Barry Bonds, and “Hammerin’ Hank” was gracious to Mr. Bonds when it happened. But aficionados of the sport recognize that the real record still belongs to the sweet swinger who played for more than two decades for the Milwaukee and then Atlanta Braves.<br />Aaron’s march to break the Babe’s record was marred by threats and racist hate mail, and he often said it motivated him all the more. Aaron had grown up in Mobile, Ala., in the Jim Crow era of the 1930s and 1940s, and he revered Jackie Robinson for breaking the color barrier in the big leagues. With his baseball success, Aaron became a hero to a generation of youngsters of all races in the decades when baseball still was America’s pastime.</td>

First came the Keystone XL pipeline kill, but perhaps more significant is the 60-day freeze on new leases on federal lands and bureaucratic permitting. The pause could soon become a long-term ban.<br />Federal lands account for about 22% of U.S. oil production, 12% of natural gas and 40% of coal. When the Obama Administration slowed oil and gas permitting on federal land, drilling and exploration shifted to private land. The Biden Administration may shut that down too.<br />Start with the 60-day suspension on new leases on federal land. Producers in older oil and gas fields won’t be significantly affected, and many have already scaled back investment in places like California and Louisiana while pouring more into shale. But shale fracking occurs in large part on federal land in western states, and it continually requires new leases and investment.<br />Federal land accounts for 51.9% of New Mexico’s oil production and 66.8% of its natural gas, as well as a sizable share of gas extraction in Colorado (41.6%), Utah (63.2%) and Wyoming (92.1%). A federal leasing ban would cost some 18,000 jobs in Colorado, 33,000 in Wyoming and 62,000 in New Mexico by 2022, according to the American Petroleum Institute.<br />States would also lose hundreds of millions of dollars of mineral royalties that are shared by the feds. Oil and gas revenue accounts for 20% of New Mexico’s budget. Downstream suppliers like fracking sand mines in Wisconsin and steel manufacturers in Pennsylvania would also be hit.</td>

      <td>Viewers of Andrew Cuomo’s Emmy-award winning Covid-19 briefings may have noticed how the New York Governor has become increasingly excitable. In this week’s budget show, he pointed an economic gun at New York and threatened to shoot if Washington doesn’t fork over $15 billion.<br />“If the federal government doesn’t fund state and local governments, it’s going to hurt all New Yorkers,” Mr. Cuomo warned Tuesday while proposing to raise the state’s top income tax rate in New York City to 14.7%. This would be the highest rate in the country, at least until New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy makes a competing bid.<br />Mr. Cuomo’s ultimatum goes like this: Democrats in Washington must deliver $15 billion in budget relief pronto or he will raise the state’s top tax rate to 10.82% from 8.82% on income over $100 million and create four new tax brackets on income of more than $5 million. New York City has a top rate of 3.88%, though Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to raise it too.<br />The Governor says the higher rates would be temporary, but New Yorkers know better than to believe him after he broke his promise to let the millionaire’s tax that Albany imposed during the 2009 recession expire. Mr. Cuomo is also begging Democrats in Congress to lift the $10,000 state-and-local tax (SALT) deduction limit to mitigate his tax hike.<br />Even if they do, they might not restore it for New York’s wealthy. And what Democrats giveth in SALT, they will taketh by raising rates. Mr. Biden has proposed increasing the top income tax rate to 39.6% from 37% (and applying it to capital gains), extending the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax to income above $400,000 and restoring the Pease deduction limitation.</td>

      <td>Impeachment for former officials was the norm at the time of the founding.</td>
      <td>One of the first questions the Senate will face in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial is whether the chamber has jurisdiction to hear a case against a former official. The correct answer is yes.<br />For the Founders, it would have been obvious that the “power to impeach” included the ability to hold former officials to account. The impeachment power was imported to America from England, where Parliament impeached only two men during the 18th century, both former officers. No U.S. state constitution limited impeachments to sitting officers, and some allowed impeachment only of former officers. In 1781 the Virginia General Assembly subjected Thomas Jefferson to an impeachment inquiry after he completed his term as governor.<br />Why would former officers be included within the impeachment power? Impeachment trials had long served as a vehicle for exposing and formally condemning official wrongdoing, or for a former officeholder to clear his name. Disqualification from future office was also an important penalty. A former Vermont lawmaker was impeached and disqualified from future state office for leading one of the tax rebellions that spurred the drafting of the U.S. Constitution. The American founders understood the history of demagogues and dictators corrupting republics and the need to exclude them from future office. As one delegate to a state ratifying convention put it, men who held public office should be “within the reach of responsibility” so that “they cannot forget that their political existence depends upon their good behavior.”<br />There’s no hint in the debate over the Constitution of an exception to the impeachment power as traditionally understood. George Mason insisted at the convention that the text should be encompassing enough at least to cover a case like that of Warren Hastings, the former colonial governor then standing trial in the British House of Lords. Everyone agreed. During ratification James Madison and Alexander Hamilton emphasized that the proposed federal impeachment power was an improvement in constitutional design because, unlike in some states, even current officers could be subjected to impeachment.<br />The Senate shouldn’t depart from centuries of practice and understanding. Declining to try Mr. Trump would set a dangerous new precedent, denying future presidents and other officials the opportunity to clear their names if they leave office, and allowing them to escape accountability by resigning—or saving their worst acts for the end of their term.</td>

      <td>He could have broken the norm that says don’t deliver unwelcome news or treat voters like grown-ups.</td>
      <td>My first surprise was that Donald Trump embraced the job after his 2016 win, not treating his election as an unwelcome accident, a publicity stunt gone awry, or a personal disaster facilitated by the mad interventions of James Comey.<br />He had every reason to. For the first time in his life, he would face opponents who didn’t merely want to get the better of him in a business deal but who craved his destruction. Welcome to politics. And he compounded his risk by his lifelong  habit of bringing only episodic focus to any issue. Example: He pretty much lost interest in Covid when he saw his press conferences were not a ratings success.<br />Only lately has anyone remembered that Woodrow Wilson presided over the 1918 flu. Mr. Trump’s performance will be faulted for many reasons but the inquiry you won’t see is one that penetrates to a deeper truth, in which Mr. Trump proved a sideshow.<br />Because of the political stakes, our every perception of Covid tends to be politicized. In the first days of the pandemic, the press coverage was alive with inquiry and discovery but soon was overtaken by talking points. This is why. And while much excellent reporting is still done, the recent summaries of our failures being ordered up by editors all read like exercises in learning nothing. They are compendiums of wouldas and shouldas that long since went poof for any thinking person.<br />Top of the list is magic solution X, a national test and trace program. I won’t mince words. A 9-year-old could see the math didn’t work. Covid spreads more easily than the flu. An overwhelming share of cases are asymptomatic or indistinguishable from ailments that millions of Americans suffer every day. In a country as big, mobile and open as the U.S., this meant there was zero chance of catching and isolating enough spreaders to matter.</td>

      <td>Republicans may feel good about their chances, but recalls often redound to the benefit of the recalled.</td>
      <td>A push to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom is gaining steam, and Republicans in the Golden State are feeling good about it. Public frustration with the state’s pandemic response, combined with outrage at Mr. Newsom’s inexplicable decision to attend a maskless dinner at the Michelin-starred French Laundry restaurant in November, has propelled a popular uprising against the first-term Democrat. The petitioners claim they have more than 1.1 million of the roughly 1.5 million valid signatures they must submit by March 17.<br />California’s chief executive is subject to one of the least onerous voter recall processes in the country. This is the sixth recall campaign in two years to target Mr. Newsom. A petition sponsor need only gather the signatures of 12% of the voter turnout in the previous statewide election—in this case 1,495,709 names. California also grants 160 days to gather those signatures (extended here because of the pandemic). Other states that allow recalls typically require twice as many signatures collected, proportionate to the population, in half as much time. A recall effort against Colorado Gov. Jared Polis only had 60 days to find 631,226 signatures in a state with one-sixth the population of California.<br />California also has a well-developed signature-gathering industry thanks to the popularity of ballot initiatives in the state. A recall can easily get on the ballot.<br />Despite Democratic dominance of California politics, Republicans haven’t gone extinct in the state. In 2020 Donald Trump won more than six million votes in California, his largest total in any state. But while the Newsom recall effort is grabbing headlines and reminding some of the successful 2003 recall of Gov. Gray Davis, another Democrat, a recall can cut both ways. It may be a humbling event or a political boon. Plenty of targeted officials have actually benefited from a recall race.<br />Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker became a Republican hero after fending off his 2012 recall. Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald defeated a recall attempt in 2012, as did California state Sen. Jeff Denham in 2008. Both went on to win seats in Congress. In 2019 California state Sen. Josh Newman was ousted in a recall vote but took the seat back in November. Dennis Kucinich barely survived a recall vote as Cleveland mayor in 1978 before going on to win a House seat and garnering 40 delegates in the 2004 Democratic presidential contest.</td>

      <td>Melvin Capital Management is down 15% just three weeks into 2021, thanks to a series of wrong-way bets that stocks including GameStop Corp. would slump.<br />Founded by 42-year-old Gabe Plotkin, a former star portfolio manager for hedge-fund titan Steven A. Cohen, Melvin bets on and against stocks and managed about $12.5 billion at the start of the year. Its short book, or array of bets against companies, has driven losses so far this year, said people familiar with the matter. Melvin’s losses were broad-based and not driven by losses on GameStop or any other specific stock, some of them said.<br />The stumble by one of the best-performing hedge funds in recent years underscores the heavy losses being suffered by short sellers at a time when major indexes have soared to records. The market is as exuberant as many traders and portfolio managers say they have seen since the tech bust 20 years ago.<br />Many investors have complained about short squeezes that have left them nursing losses. In a short squeeze, heavy buying forces short bettors to buy back shares to limit their losses.<br />A sign of the pain short sellers are experiencing:  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s  basket of the 50 stocks with the highest short interest as a share of market capitalization was up a total 25% for the year through Friday, compared with a total-return of 2.4% by the S&P 500.</td>

It marks a record for SPAC deals, which have become all the rage on Wall Street, according to data provider SPACInsider.<br />The Michigan-based mortgage company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol UWMC, closed at $11.35 on Friday, slightly below Gores Holdings’ closing price of $11.54 on Thursday.<br />SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, put a reverse spin on the conventional model for public offerings because they raise money before developing a business. They use the funds to make an acquisition that turns the target into a public company. Once the blank-check company merges with a target company, as Gores Holdings and UWM did Thursday, that company gets the SPAC’s spot on a stock exchange, enabling it to sell shares to the public.<br />UWM works with independent brokers around the country to underwrite and service mortgages. It is one of a number of nonbank mortgage companies embracing the public markets at a booming time for the U.S. housing market. Low interest rates helped push mortgage originations to record levels in 2020. UWM was the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. in the first three quarters of 2020, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance.</td>

On the campaign trail, he said he would create a cabinet-level group to focus on promoting union organizing and collective bargaining.<br />Mr. Biden backs passage of legislation sought by labor groups to increase union membership and boost employee protections. The bill would weaken state-level right-to-work laws, which prohibit unions from compelling membership as a condition of employment, and block firms from replacing striking workers, among other measures.

Greg Abbott and Ken Cuccinelli, then acting deputy secretary of homeland security, says it establishes a binding and enforceable commitment between DHS and Texas, in which DHS would “consult with Texas before taking any action or making any decision that could reduce immigration enforcement, increase the number of removable or inadmissible aliens in the United States, or increase immigration benefits or eligibility for benefits for removable or inadmissible aliens.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—In a new document made public Friday, the nation’s top military intelligence agency acknowledged monitoring the location of U.S.-based mobile devices without a warrant through location data drawn from ordinary smartphone apps.<br />The Defense Intelligence Agency told congressional investigators that the agency has access to “commercially available geolocation metadata aggregated from smartphones” from both the U.S. and abroad. It said it had queried its database to look at the location information of U.S.-based smartphones five times in the last 2½ years as part of authorized investigations.<br />Such data is typically drawn from smartphone apps such as weather, games and other apps that get user permission to access a phone’s GPS location. A robust commercial market exists for such data for advertising and other commercial purposes. The Wall Street Journal first revealed last year that numerous U.S. government agencies were also buying access to that data from commercial brokers without a warrant, raising questions about whether those agencies were adequately safeguarding the privacy and civil liberties of Americans.<br />The ability of U.S. intelligence agencies to access data on Americans for intelligence purposes is typically circumscribed. A warrant from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is required for most kinds of surveillance. However, the Defense Intelligence Agency told Congress that it didn’t believe it needed any sort of court authorization to acquire commercial data for foreign intelligence or national security purposes.<br />That echoes a position taken by numerous other U.S. government agencies in recent years as the amount of data on individuals using computers, smartphones and tablets has exploded. The Department of Homeland Security is buying a similar data product and is using it for warrantless tracking as part of its border security and immigration mission. The Internal Revenue Service also purchased access to cellphone data as part of its law enforcement mission. All claim because the data is purchased on the open market, no court order is required.</td>

The pandemic prompted many of them to leave big cities for suburbs or smaller towns, while record-low borrowing rates made the decision to trade up easier. Once shelter-in-place restrictions eased, sales took off in June and have rarely flagged since then.<br />“It’s totally because of the pandemic,” said Brittany McCreary, who with her husband last month bought their first home, a four-bedroom stone farmhouse, in York, Pa., after leaving the Chicago area. “We’re glad we’re not renting anymore. We always wanted to buy.”<br />Existing-home sales rose 0.7% in December from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. The December sales marked a 22% increase from a year earlier.</td>

The National Security Council has also been directed to develop ways to identify threats, share information and disrupt networks, she said, adding that free-speech rights would be respected.<br />In announcing the initiative, Ms. Psaki mentioned the Capitol riot and not other specific instances after nearly a year of unrest in cities across America. Republicans have been critical of Mr. Biden for what they contend was a belated condemnation of unrest over the summer involving left-wing activists in Portland, Ore., and Seattle who targeted federal buildings—violence that was reprised in those cities on Inauguration Day.<br />In a subsequent exchange with The Wall Street Journal, Ms. Psaki said the president opposes such violence in all forms.</td>

Oil has stayed in a tight trading range recently as investors weigh worries about crumbling consumption against large supply reductions.<br />Prices have increased steadily since the beginning of the year, with the U.S. benchmark passing $50 a barrel last month for the first time since early last year. That was when a production fight between major producers flooded global markets just as the pandemic’s first round of shutdowns sent consumption plunging. An oil glut threatened to overwhelm storage, sending prices below $0 for the first time.<br />Signs that major producers intend to continue output cuts, as well as a faster-than-expected economic recovery in China, have since powered a rebound. Many traders now say further gains require an acceleration in demand from increased travel and a broader reopening.<br />Denting those hopes in recent sessions: the slow rollout of vaccines and warnings of ongoing pandemic restrictions.

      <td>WASHINGTON—In his first three days in office, President Biden has taken more than two dozen executive actions designed to reverse Trump administration policies and enact longstanding liberal priorities on protecting the environment, enhancing workers’ protections and increasing the role of government in the economy.<br />The moves have prompted opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who say that they undermine Mr. Biden’s push for bipartisan deal making and national unity, a major theme of his inaugural address. At the same time, while his early policy efforts have been broadly cheered by Democrats, some progressives are urging him to go further, reflecting Mr. Biden’s challenge of balancing pressures from both parties.<br />Since taking office Wednesday, Mr. Biden’s actions have reversed some of former President Donald Trump’s highest-profile policy initiatives by overturning a travel ban on several majority-Muslim and other countries and revoking a permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. They also lay the groundwork for what Mr. Biden says will be his administration’s focus: boosting economic growth, dealing with the pandemic, and increasing government spending on programs designed to assist Americans hard hit by the pandemic-induced recession.<br />“There is plenty of time for President Biden to remember that he does not owe his election to the far left,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) in a speech Thursday. He accused Mr. Biden of contradicting his rhetoric on bipartisanship by catering to a progressive agenda with moves such as revoking the Keystone XL permit and rejoining the Paris climate accord.<br />“The American people stunned the so-called experts with the number of Republicans they sent to the House and the Senate to make sure common-sense conservative values have a powerful say in this government,” Mr. McConnell said. “So our side is ready to share ideas and work with the Biden administration, applying common sense to find common ground for the common good.”</td>

Jamie Raskin of Maryland.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) gave no guidance on how long the trial would last or whether the Senate could conduct other business as the trial is proceeding.<br />“It will be a full trial, it will be a fair trial,” he said Friday on the Senate floor.</td>

EU nations have placed big orders for the AstraZeneca shot, partly because it doesn’t require the cold storage needed for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Officials have been banking on the arrival of their AstraZeneca orders next month to speed up bloc-wide vaccinations.<br />The AstraZeneca disclosure also threatens a fresh reputational hit to the British pharmaceutical giant, which partnered with the University of Oxford in developing the vaccine. AstraZeneca is responsible for manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine, as well as regulatory approvals.<br />The company has previously faced criticism over how it initially communicated results of the vaccine’s late-stage human trials.</td>

NBCUniversal informed staffers of the plan Friday afternoon in a company memo.<br />“We’re absolutely committed more than ever to live sports as a company, and having such a huge platform like USA Network airing some of our key sports content is great for our partners, distributors, viewers and advertisers alike,” said NBC Sports Group Chairman Pete Bevacqua.<br />By putting high-profile sports on USA Network, NBCUniversal—a unit of  Comcast Corp. —is hoping to solve two problems with one move: Get rid of an underperforming asset and boost an already powerful one. English Premier soccer will also have matches on USA.<br />NBCSN has struggled to compete against bigger rivals such as  Walt Disney  Co. ’s ESPN and  Fox Corp.’s  Fox Sports cable network. While it has a large national reach, its ratings pale in comparison to its competition. Fox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent  News Corp  share common ownership.</td>

      <td>Proposal comes as faculty members escalate opposition to criminal cases and the U.S. balances international academic collaboration with proper disclosure</td>
      <td>Justice Department officials are weighing an amnesty program under which U.S. academics could disclose past foreign funding without fear of punishment for their disclosures, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />High-level officials, including Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers, have discussed the program in recent months, and circulated a draft proposal for it, these people said.<br />Consideration of the program comes as the U.S. government continues to grapple with how to support international academic collaboration while making sure professors disclose foreign sources of funding. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department tried to target what it says are potentially inappropriate efforts by China to gain access to cutting-edge U.S. scientific research being funded by U.S. taxpayers.<br />Federal prosecutors have brought more than a dozen criminal cases since mid-2019 accusing academics of lying about receiving Chinese government funding or alleging that visiting researchers lied about their affiliation with the Chinese military, some of which have resulted in guilty pleas.<br />The program being discussed could allow investigators to ascertain the scope of foreign money funding U.S. research, and help FBI agents focus on the people they believed posed the greatest national security threats, the people said. But the plan hasn’t yet been implemented, and some prosecutors are concerned that it could undercut existing cases, the people said. Mr. Demers declined to comment.</td>

      <td>Ornately-carved pillars and friezes from a 16th-century South Indian temple bring the stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata to life.</td>
      <td>Stepping into the South Asian galleries of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (which reopened on Jan. 8 after being closed due to Covid-19), we walk between two large figures that artists in South India carved around 1560. They don’t immediately register as pillars, so prominently do the sculptures protrude. One portrays a handsome young man sitting under a tree looking rather pleased with himself. He is Rama, god and hero of the Ramayana epic, flanked by his wife, Sita, and the ever-loyal monkey king, Hanuman, carved in relief on either side of the monolithic pillar. Opposite him stands a bearded man with the haunches of a beast, leaning forward, club raised to do battle. Yet this “man-beast,” or Purushamirukam, feels more theatrical than menacing with his mound of neatly coiffed hair, delicately arched eyebrows, and loads of jewelry. He isn’t about to attack; he’s enacting a story.<br />This feeling of performance intensifies as we take in the pillared temple hall—or mandapa—that fills the rest of the gallery. Rows of slender columns demarcate three sides of a rectangle within which 10 more life-size figures, bejeweled from headdress to anklet, face one another across a broad space. Above them, lions look down from the capitals and a partial frieze of reliefs illustrates scenes from the Ramayana while, on the slender columns and the sides and backs of the figural pillars, a plethora of mostly smaller reliefs beckon. They include baby Krishna dancing with delight, a ball of butter cupped in each hand; an architect-priest with his measuring stick; musicians, dancers, animals; and, twice, a pregnant woman sitting, head resting in her hand. She is likely Sita in a fraught scene from an addendum to the Ramayana. (Photographs and a video on the museum’s website can’t capture the carvings’ impact but provide useful aids.)<br />To 16th-century South Indians, these reliefs and monumental figures conjured verses penned by revered saints and episodes from epics and local folk tales. To gather in a mandapa, then, was to take part in a festival, attend a performance or join a social gathering, all in the company of divine, literary and royal personages. But while the configuration in the museum follows basic conventions for mandapas, it does not replicate a structure that once existed. It can’t. Its 60-plus blocks of carved granite were lying in a pile of rubble when Adeline Pepper Gibson, Philadelphia heiress and lover of art, purchased them from a trustee of the Madana Gopala Swamy Temple in Madurai in 1912.<br />There is no record of when the mandapa was dismantled (most likely to make way for new construction), nor any information about its original configuration. Darielle Mason, the museum’s curator for South Asian and Himalayan art, knows there was “a logic to each element” and thought-out relationships among figures, but holds little hope of ever re-creating what an architect-priest was thinking centuries ago. Her research has, however, convinced her that almost everything Pepper purchased was part of a single mandapa; that it was probably open on at least three sides, as suggested by the gallery’s sky blue walls; and that Rama and Purushamirukam belong with the others who stand in the center, inviting us to come close.<br />Nothing—no strip along the floor, no pane of glass—gets in the way of our admiring the skill it took to carve into hard granite the delicate ridges of a robe, the smooth swell of a belly, the curl of a lip or each graduated bead of a necklace. There is a sense of incipient movement, whether it is a slightly bent knee or the start of a bow. We recognize Hanuman by the long, sinuous tail; a demigod by a small, sharp fang; and the bird-god Garuda by the broken-off quills and feathers of wings. Two of the figures hold gourds, marking them as sages, and four appear to be saints. Then there is the muscular, mustachioed warrior standing atop diminutive pachyderms who, like Purushamirukam, holds a mace poised midair. He is Bhima of the Mahabharata epic, a man with the strength of 10,000 elephants, emerging from stone into our world like a superhero.</td>

      <td>Oil-and-gas companies seek new routes to market for Canada’s top export</td>
      <td>TORONTO—President Biden’s revocation of a permit for  TC Energy Corp.’s  Keystone XL pipeline is raising pressure on Canada’s energy industry to seek new markets for oil and gas, its top export.<br />Mr. Biden revoked the Keystone XL permit on Wednesday, hours after taking office, effectively shutting down a 12-year, cross-border project that would have carried 830,000 barrels a day from Alberta to Nebraska and eventually to refiners on the Gulf Coast. His executive order, which fulfilled a campaign promise, cited concerns about climate change.<br />Canada, the world’s fourth-largest oil producer, is left with fewer options to get its dense, sticky crude from landlocked oil sands to U.S. refiners. Canada and industry executives are also working to counter claims that tapping oil sands is more damaging to the climate than some other types of oil. They say Canadian producers have lowered carbon emissions by using less coal-fired power and more renewable energy to run their operations, among other steps.<br />Chris Bloomer, president of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, a trade group, said Mr. Biden’s decision didn’t take into account the work the Canadian industry has done to reduce emissions. “Obviously, it’s very disappointing,” he said.<br />Jason Kenney, leader of the province of Alberta, where most of Canada’s oil is produced, wrote a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau requesting that Canada press the U.S. for compensation. Scott Moe, premier of Saskatchewan, said Mr. Trudeau shouldn’t accept the rescinding of the permit. “I’d ask him to be firmer in his tone,” Mr. Moe said in an interview.</td>

Bon voyage!<br />IF YOU’RE the kind of traveler who values small pleasures over spectacular monuments, the Dutch capital of Amsterdam is a place you visit more than once. You get drawn back again and again, to bike along glittering canals, sip tiny beers in charming old “brown cafes,” and just otherwise bask in pleasant vibes.

The proposal, made soon after President Xi Jinping congratulated Mr. Biden on his election victory, was through letters by the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, and through conversations with intermediaries.<br />Beijing is planning a different message for Mr. Yang to bring to Washington than it had delivered during the Trump administration, when trade issues were Washington’s priority. Now, with Mr. Biden emphasizing climate change and the pandemic, Mr. Yang plans to also focus on those issues, as well as getting in train an initial meeting between Messrs. Biden and Xi.<br />Chinese officials have asked for the meeting in backchannel outreach, but haven’t made a formal request to the Biden national security team, which is just getting set up in the White House, and other government agencies.<br />One of the people familiar with the discussions said the Chinese have been cautious in engaging with the Biden administration, given the deep divisions between the two nations and Beijing’s wariness of having the offer of a face-to-face meeting rejected.</td>

Understanding that few teachers and even fewer students are at high risk from Covid-19, Iowa’s governor is determined to let kids learn in school.

      <td>Disappointing results bring stock back to where it was before the company announced a spin-off meant to boost growth prospects</td>
      <td>IBM  is learning fast that even ambitious weight loss plans don’t always solve everything.<br />The company more formally known as International Business Machines posted disappointing fourth-quarter results late Thursday. Revenue slipped across the company’s business lines, though the most painful miss came in Big Blue’s cloud and cognitive software segment, which saw revenue fall 4.5% year over year to $6.8 billion. That was well below the $7.3 billion Wall Street had been expecting for a key business unit that had been showing steady growth of late. The Dow component’s share price sunk 10% on Friday in its worst post-earnings reaction in at least five years, according to FactSet.<br />Friday’s selloff also takes the stock back to its levels from before the company announced a plan in October to spin off a major part of its services business in order to focus more on growth areas such as cloud computing. That gave a boost to the shares, on the belief that a smaller, more-focused IBM would be able to regain some growth momentum. But that deal isn’t expected to be completed until much later this year, and IBM has yet to share the financial details of what the remaining company will look like. In the meantime, analysts are growing more skeptical about IBM’s promise that it can grow post-spin revenue in the mid-single-digit range. David Vogt of  UBS  called the target “lofty” in a note to clients Friday.<br />At less than 11 times forward earnings, IBM is the cheapest stock among tech companies valued at more than $100 billion, according to FactSet. But valuation alone won’t sell the stock in a market that favors growth prospects above all. IBM’s market value is now below that of  Zoom Video Communications —a company that generates less than 3% of IBM’s revenue. In such a market, it will take more than a radical diet for Big Blue to get back some sizzle.<br />Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</td>

      <td>Spread over two floors of a palazzo beside the River Arno in Florence, amid the treasures of the Italian Renaissance, is perhaps the world’s largest private collection of art by modern female abstractionists.<br />Walking down the street you would never know it was there. Even if you knew the name of the collector, former hedge-fund manager Christian Levett, you would have to squint long and hard to find it in the cluster of little brass name plates alongside the palazzo’s massive door. But once across the threshold you are surrounded by paintings by Lee Krasner, Elaine de Kooning, Helen Frankenthaler, Grace Hartigan, Joan Mitchell and other Abstract Expressionists who helped revolutionize art after World War II, turning New York City into the capital of Western culture for the first time.<br />“There might be someone out there who has 10 Joan Mitchells, say. But in terms of breadth—and depth—I think this collection is unrivaled,” says Mr. Levett. It comprises 80 pictures, including 10 Elaine de Koonings and what is arguably Krasner’s most important work, the 1956 painting “Prophecy.” Elsewhere in the apartment are sculptures by Louise Bourgeois, works by Bridget Riley and tapestries by Tracey Emin.<br />Mr. Levett, 50, began his career in finance in 1991 and went on to work for  Goldman Sachs  before founding the commodity hedge fund Clive Capital. He bought his first painting, by the 17th-century Dutch master Egbert van der Poel, in 1996. It cost 100,000 French francs, a little less than $20,000.<br />His interest in art burgeoned along with his ability to buy progressively more important works. He went through what he describes as “different periods of fanaticism”: coins and hand-painted books, Old Masters, antiquities, ancient arms and armor (he sits on the Metropolitan Museum’s visitors’ committee for arms and armor). Many of his antiquities are housed in the Mougins Museum of Classical Art, a four-story museum that Mr. Levett founded in 2009 in a French village near Cannes.</td>

That was down from 7.4% entering the year. Yields fall when bond prices rise.<br />Record-low yields for the worst-rated bonds mark a reversal after pandemic shutdowns fueled a selloff in riskier debt less than a year ago. Back then, investors expected many struggling companies to go bankrupt or default. Credit markets froze, driving yields to recent postcrisis peaks, particularly for low-rated firms.<br />Actions by the Federal Reserve, including cutting interest rates and buying billions of dollars worth of bonds, helped fuel a recovery in corporate debt. With interest rates near zero, investors have ventured into riskier assets, including junk-rated corporate bonds, in search of higher yields. That has helped many struggling companies refinance their debt at lower interest rates.<br />Now, the prospect of vaccines and a return to economic normalcy are powering a recovery in the lowest-rated junk debt, a market made up of companies particularly sensitive to the economy’s direction. Triple-C rated corporate bonds have so far returned 2.2% to investors in January, according to Bank of America, outpacing gains on higher-rated corporate bonds and leveraged loans.</td>

      <td>The Trump years had something for almost everyone. Progressives had the satisfaction of righteousness and a justification for daily outrage. What they didn’t have were policy victories, although they might have had a few if they could have refrained, even for a few days, from treating the president as illegitimate. For conservatives, the case was exactly reversed: They had some major policy wins, but at the cost of frequent embarrassment and dismay at the president’s offensive behavior and self-defeating logorrhea.<br />The worst of his conduct took place after the 2020 election and seemed to fulfill progressive commentators’ allegation that Donald Trump was carrying out an “assault on democracy.” Mr. Trump’s refusal to accept defeat, culminating in demands that Vice President Mike Pence overturn a lawful election on no legal authority, occasioned a debacle that may haunt the Republican Party, and the country, for years.<br />Even so, the most salient theme of the past five years was not any challenge to democracy. The great theme of the Trump years, the one historians will note a century from now, was the failure of America’s expert class. The people who were supposed to know what they were talking about, didn’t.<br />The failure began with the country’s top consultants and pollsters. Candidate Trump did almost everything lavishly paid political consultants would have told him, and did tell him, not to do—and he won. The most respected pollsters, meanwhile, predicted a landslide for Hillary Clinton. America’s best and brightest political adepts turned out to know very little about the elections they claim to understand.<br />Also during the 2016 campaign, an assemblage of top-tier academics, intellectuals and journalists warned that Mr. Trump’s candidacy signified a fascist threat. Timothy Snyder, a historian of Nazism at Yale, was among the most strident of these prophets. “Be calm when the unthinkable arrives,” he warned in a  Facebook  post shortly after the election. “When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authorities at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire.” Many experts stuck with the fascism theme after Mr. Trump’s election and throughout his presidency. That these cultured authorities couldn’t tell the difference between a populist protest against elite contempt and a coup carried out by powerful ideologues will go down as one of the great fiascoes of American intellectual history.</td>

In fact, it goes much further.<br />In Bostock, the justices held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited an employer from firing an employee on the basis of homosexuality or “transgender status.” Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for a 6-3 majority, took pains to clarify that the decision was limited to employment and had no bearing on “sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes”—all regulated under Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments. “Under Title VII, too,” the majority added, “we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”<br />The Biden executive order is far more ambitious. Any school that receives federal funding—including nearly every public high school—must either allow biological boys who self-identify as girls onto girls’ sports teams or face administrative action from the Education Department. If this policy were to be broadly adopted in anticipation of the regulations that are no doubt on the way, what would this mean for girls’ and women’s sports?<br />“Finished. Done,” Olympic track-and-field coach Linda Blade told me. “The leadership skills, all the benefits society gets from letting girls have their protected category so that competition can be fair, all the advances of women’s rights—that’s going to be diminished.” Ms. Blade noted that parents of teen girls are generally uninterested in watching their daughters demoralized by the blatant unfairness of a rigged competition.</td>

But British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a televised address that the variant—which has caused Covid-19 infections across the U.K. to spike and is spreading rapidly in the U.S.—could result in higher death rates.<br />U.S. federal health authorities have said it is likely to become the dominant variant in the U.S. by March.<br />“We have been informed today that, in addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant—the variant that was first identified in London and the South East—may be associated with a higher degree of mortality,” said Mr. Johnson.<br />The tentative conclusions come as British hospitals cope with more Covid-19 patients than at any time during the pandemic. The Covid-19 death toll in the U.K. is expected to pass 100,000 in the coming week.</td>

      <td>Robert L. Woodson Sr. and Joshua Mitchell fail to present a convincing case that the left has hijacked the struggle for civil rights (“How the Left Hijacked Civil Rights,” op-ed, Jan. 16). They claim many black leaders reject the country’s founding principles. Not so. What many modern black leaders do is shine a bright light on the gross hypocrisy of declaring “all men are created equal” while tolerating slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarceration, lynchings and general discrimination both social and governmental throughout our history.<br />The authors state that the radical left has been working to keep blacks in a constant state of agitation. It isn’t the so-called “radical left” that has prompted this agitation but the reality of a long list of incidents of police killings of unarmed African-Americans.<br />Messrs. Woodson and Mitchell also decry the left’s supposed rejection of “bourgeois self-restraint and discipline” and support for “indulging in the passions of the moment.” Some African-Americans who were raised in poverty and an environment of mass incarceration conclude what’s best is living for the moment; this is understandable when many in their community are either dead or in jail before they are 30. This phenomenon is an indictment of our social structure, not of those who experience or point it out.<br />Joseph Kaufman<br />Seattle</td>

      <td>A medieval English title becomes a job description for Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris.</td>
      <td>While Kamala Harrishas made history by becoming the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president, her husband Doug Emhoff is blazing his own trail as the nation’s first “Second Gentleman.” The Biden administration’s White House website prominently emblazons Mr. Emhoff’s page with the title “Second Gentleman,” and his official  Twitter  handle is likewise @SecondGentleman.<br />Mr. Emhoff’s honorific uses “gentleman” as the male counterpart to “lady” in the traditional titles of “First Lady” and “Second Lady” for the wives of the president and vice president, respectively. But while his formal designation may be new, it’s built on centuries of linguistic etiquette.<br />“Gentleman” itself dates back to around 1200 in English, originally modeled on the French equivalent, “gentilhomme.” “Gentle” originally meant “belonging to a good, upstanding family,” from Latin “gentilis,” meaning “of the same family or clan.” The title was used for a man in the lower tier of respectability—one whose family was not ranked with the nobility yet was still entitled to a coat of arms.<br />Over time, the “gentility” of the gentleman came to be linked to the chivalrous manners that were expected to go along with his social standing. By the 19th century, “ladies and gentlemen” had become a conventional form of address for an audience of men and women, conveying polite respect regardless of people’s social rank.<br />Exported to the American scene, both “lady” and “gentleman” carried a whiff of their aristocratic background despite the country’s ostensibly egalitarian spirit. The wife of the president was rhetorically elevated to “the first lady of the land” or “the first lady” for short. An 1870 article in the Detroit Free Press laid out the pecking order in Washington society: “We know who is first lady and we know who is second lady—the wives of the President and Vice President have unquestionably these distinctions.”</td>

      <td>With one in four gyms projected to close last year due to the pandemic, Americans began spending big on Pelotons and other digitally connected home-workout equipment. Now some say we’ll never go back.</td>
      <td>WITH THE ONSET of Covid-19, gyms across the country closed their doors. Many of us who habitually hit a spin class or gritted our teeth through circuit training were newly stranded at home, confronting the seeming inevitability of flabbiness. Where were our walls of mirrors? Our post-workout showers that let us hand-pump hair conditioner so liberally? As our scrunchies lay dormant, we even grew wistful for the awkwardness of locker rooms.<br />Now, almost a year later, we’re far less nostalgic. Many have found novel, even superior, digitally connected ways to stay fit at home—and it’s beginning to look like we’ll never return to gyms again. That is, if they’re even still there: Last September, the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association estimated that up to one in four would permanently close by 2020’s end. And a TD Ameritrade survey found that 59% of Americans don’t plan to renew their gym memberships after the pandemic.<br />Meanwhile, we’ve been outfitting our homes with pricey Peloton bikes at such a rate the brand saw profits grow by 100% in 2020 to $1.8 billion. Rival equipment outfitter Nautilus saw its 2020 third-quarter sales jump 151.8% year over year. Even the relatively new Mirror, whose interactive fitness “machine” is a sleek, wall-mounted looking-glass that does not junk up décor, was expected to bring in $100 million in revenue in 2020.<br />The shifting dynamic has triggered new thinking. Kara Liotta, former creative director and trainer at New York-based indoor cycling studio Flywheel Sports, saw the crash of gyms as an opportunity. “My partner and I had always thought about doing our own thing, but I had been too afraid to leave a big company,” she said.<br />In March 2020, they launched KKSweat, a virtual boutique fitness platform offering live and on-demand classes over Zoom. While her former employer, Flywheel, declared bankruptcy in September and closed all 42 of its studios, she and her partner are producing 15 classes a week for more than 500 people. “Eleven months in, and this feels like the new norm,” she said.</td>

      <td>Oil-field services companies show signs of improvement; sentiment-driven selloff could be opportunity to pick up shares on the cheap</td>
      <td>Discipline has been the mantra of American energy companies for a while. Judging from oil-field services companies’ results this week, they are walking the walk, not just talking the talk.<br />Given the recent rally in oil prices, a lingering question is whether drillers will keep up their promise of spending discipline. By the fourth quarter, the U.S. land rig count had recovered sharply from its August 2020 nadir.  Halliburton ,   Baker Hughes  and  Schlumberger  all experienced improvements in North American revenue in the fourth quarter. Notably, Halliburton had a 26% increase in North American revenue in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. A year-over-year comparison, however, makes it clear just how steep the road to recovery will be: Revenue in the region was down 47% compared with a year earlier. Its international segment’s revenue declined by a milder 30% over the same period.<br />The service companies’ recovery might not signal a quick uptick in U.S. fracking. All three indicated that they expect customers to add rigs gradually. Halliburton mentioned that it was private and small operators that added the most rigs, with large exploration and production companies and major oil companies moving more slowly. Those larger companies will most likely start adding back rigs in the first half of the year, according to Baker Hughes.<br />The servicers’ actions speak louder than words: None of them plan on meaningfully increasing their capital expenditures in 2021. That is quite remarkable given the fact that they slashed them so dramatically last year after already making sizable cuts in 2019. Halliburton and Schlumberger reduced their capital expenditures by 50% and 35%, respectively, last year.<br />The caution seems prudent. Oil producers will try to get by with fewer services, for example, and consolidation is under way in the oil patch. The Biden administration cast an additional shadow on the industry Thursday when it announced a temporary ban on new oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal lands.</td>

He also will use the act to boost supplies such as “low dead space” syringes, which can be used to squeeze more doses out of vaccine vials.<br />Mr. Biden, inaugurated Wednesday, has set a plan to administer 100 million vaccine doses in the first 100 days of his presidency.<br />The goal of invoking the DPA is to ensure all available vaccines are being used and administered quicker, an administration official said. The administration is working to help increase supplies such as syringes, the official said, and trying to get ahead of problems it anticipates with hard-to-source critical items to prevent future vaccine shortages.<br />The Defense Production Act was enacted during the Korean War to spur domestic industry to shore up the military, and has been amended since to grant powers that can be used in national emergencies.</td>

      <td>Google’s parent company is winding down a project that used highflying balloons to provide internet access in hard-to-reach regions of the world, as it retreats from some of the moonshot projects championed by its founders.<br />The project, known as Loon, started in 2011 and had its first public launch in New Zealand in 2013. It sought to connect billions of people in communities where traditional ground-based infrastructure was too expensive or too difficult to install. But Loon, which was overseen by  Alphabet Inc.,  was unable to reduce costs enough to make its business model sustainable, the project’s leader, Alastair Westgarth, wrote in a blog post Thursday.<br />“Developing radical new technology is inherently risky, but that doesn’t make breaking this news any easier,” Mr. Westgarth wrote.<br />Loon’s technology sent gas-filled polyethylene balloons the size of tennis courts into the stratosphere, typically to altitudes of around 60,000 to 75,000 feet. There, onboard communications equipment beamed internet signals back down to earth. The system was able deliver mobile coverage to an area 200 times greater than a typical ground-based cell tower, Mr. Westgarth wrote.<br />Loon was part of the conglomerate’s “Other Bets” segment, a collection of independent projects that include self-driving car initiative Waymo, life-sciences company Verily, and venture investment arm GV. The segment recorded an operating loss of more than $3.3 billion through the first nine months of 2020, steeper than the nearly $2.8 billion loss recorded in the comparable period a year earlier.</td>

      <td>It might seem unusual, even presumptuous, for a 72-year-old man to write a memoir covering just the first 21 years of his life, as James Taylor did last year with “Break Shot,” published as an Audible Original audiobook. But Mr. Taylor’s first two decades were extraordinary. He had already lived a privileged but tormented childhood, seen his New York rock ’n’ roll dreams collapse, spent time in a mental institution, been addicted to heroin, recorded with the Beatles, lived in both swinging London and Los Angeles’ Laurel Canyon at its creative peak, and cut a landmark second album, “Sweet Baby James,” that included the classic “Fire and Rain.”<br />“I stopped the story with the release of ‘Sweet Baby James’ because at that point, I become a public person and said everything worth saying,” says Mr. Taylor on the phone from a recent Montana ski trip. “I was on the cover of Time magazine in 1971 and became sort of an open book.”<br />Mr. Taylor has had a seismic cultural impact. His manager says that he has sold 100 million albums. Taylor Swift was named after him, as she announced from the stage of Madison Square Garden in 2011 when Mr. Taylor joined her to sing “Fire and Rain.” In addition to his own songs, Mr. Taylor has excelled as an interpreter, notching hits with covers including Carole King’s “You’ve Got a Friend” and “How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You),” which was written by the Motown team of Lamont Dozier, Brian Holland and Eddie Holland.<br />On his most recent releases, 2020’s “American Standard” and the three-song EP follow-up “Over the Rainbow,” Mr. Taylor’s taste in covers gets more eclectic. He focuses on songs he learned in his childhood, including “Moon River,” “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” and “Surrey With a Fringe on Top” from the musical “Oklahoma!”, mostly performed as guitar duets between Mr. Taylor and the jazz great John Pizzarelli. “American Standard” has been nominated for a Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album—his 19th nomination on his 19th album. He has previously won five.<br />“Early in my career, I found it almost embarrassing to be nominated for Grammys,” says Mr. Taylor. “I was dismissive and arrogant and felt an adversarial relationship with the business side of music, which only wanted massive hits and turned a blind eye toward so much beauty. Now that albums don’t sell like they used to, there’s no longer a king’s ransom involved, and the people left are really dedicated. It feels like more of a team effort, and I appreciate the acknowledgment of all that work.”</td>

      <td>A 20% rise in the price of cobalt since the beginning of this year shows how the rush to build more electric vehicles is stressing global supply chains.<br />Already a shortage of semiconductors is slowing the recovery in auto production. Now cobalt, a blue metal that is needed for many types of batteries including those in EVs, is a concern, according to people in the auto and battery industries and analysts.<br />“The demand is not going to shrink any time soon, while the supply remains tight mainly due to logistics disruptions in South Africa during the pandemic,” said Ying Lu, an analyst at  London-based commodity research firm Roskill.<br />Energy-dense cobalt is used as the stabilizer in batteries. It helps protect the battery’s cathode from corrosion that can lead to a fire.<br />A majority of the world’s cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa. It typically is carried overland to South Africa, shipped out from the port of Durban, South Africa, and processed in China before the material goes to battery makers—meaning the supply chain has several choke points that make it vulnerable to disruption.</td>

      <td>While American democracy struggled to cope with the pandemic, economic crisis and political unrest, Chinese authoritarianism could point to notable successes—and rising international clout.</td>
      <td>In late 2019, a group of international public health experts set out to assess pandemic preparedness around the world. Using criteria such as early virus detection, speed of response and adherence to international health norms, they ranked the U.S. first, China a distant fifty-first.<br />The experience with Covid-19, which swept the world shortly after that ranking was published, suggests that the experts got it backward. Among major countries, the U.S. has one of the highest per capita death tolls, China the lowest. The pandemic continues to spread in the U.S. while it remains mostly under control in China except for localized outbreaks.<br />Covid-19 wasn’t the only area in which China outshone the U.S. in 2020. Its economy managed to grow while the American economy shrank. Its political system grew stronger as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) reasserted control over Hong Kong and China’s unruly private sector. Meanwhile, American democracy took a hit as outgoing President Donald Trump sought to overturn last fall’s election, culminating with a group of his followers violently storming the Capitol. Joe Biden took the oath of office this week behind military-style fortifications guarded by troops.<br />If the U.S. and China are strategic competitors, as both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden maintain, then judging by the last 12 months, China is winning. Its centralized, authoritarian model has been ruthlessly efficient at mobilizing individuals, companies and government to combat Covid-19, face down foreign adversaries and deepen its technological know-how in areas such as semiconductors. U.S. efforts over the past year, by contrast, have been repeatedly undermined by the collision of interests within its pluralistic, decentralized system and among its fellow democracies.<br />The U.S. has successfully adapted to internal and external challenges for over two centuries, and it would be unwise to count it out now. Yet the past year poses uncomfortable questions about whether the American system can meet the challenge of China.</td>

      <td>Robert Gersony’s job was investigating human misery. Not everyone welcomed the truth.</td>
      <td>As a government official, I twice had the good fortune to meet Robert Paul Gersony, whose adventurous and consequential life is the subject of a remarkable biography by Robert Kaplan, his friend of 30 years. Mr. Kaplan, the well-known author of a dozen books about foreign affairs, calls “The Good American” his “most important and ambitious work,” an inspiring story of “America in the wider world.”<br />For four decades, working mostly as a consultant on contract, Bob Gersony provided ground truth to U.S. government leaders that saved countless lives—in Southeast Asia, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Bosnia and elsewhere. His story is inspiring because it affirms the possibility that facts, objectively researched and dispassionately presented, can change policy for the better. His work is also the achievement of a man who was apparently “twice-exceptional”—gifted but also suffering from a learning disability.<br />“Throughout my life,” Mr. Gersony says, “I could only remember text through the physical act of typing.” Consequently, he hated formal education and dropped out of high school to join the Army and serve in a casualty-report unit in Vietnam. There he acquired what Mr. Kaplan calls “his belief in the essential wisdom of the common person”—not the thinker or theorist, but the man or woman who knew the world “only from the grassroots level in the most immediate, concrete way.” From that belief he developed a unique way to build trusting relationships with refugees and displaced people, empowering traumatized individuals to tell their painful but revealing stories.<br />In 1984, Mr. Gersony provided the solution to a humanitarian problem that was particularly troubling for me as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Thai pirates had been attacking Vietnamese refugee boats and raping, pillaging and killing the passengers. It was a devastating crisis both because of its scale—on the order of 200,000 to 400,000 refugee deaths over the years—and because these victims were suffering for having been U.S. allies.<br />Supplying the Thais with coast-guard cutters and aircraft to patrol the South China Sea was not a solution, particularly since most of the time these “pirates” were engaged in legitimate commercial fishing; it was difficult to catch them in their opportunistic moments of criminal activity. After interviewing dozens of victimized Vietnamese, Mr. Gersony realized that pursuing “part-time pirates of convenience” was futile; better to concentrate on the hard-core element who bragged about their exploits in the dockside bars. That was a job for the police onshore, not for patrol boats and planes.</td>

      <td>Throughout Bedford’s books, the depth of human tragedy lies just beneath a comedy of manners.</td>
      <td>‘The nightmare fable of our time is a true story,” Sybille Bedford once declared. She would know. Born in Berlin before World War I and living for almost a century in France, Italy, England and, briefly, the United States, she chronicled that nightmare fable in a series of extraordinary and often uncategorizable books: four novels, a two-volume biography of Aldous Huxley, a comparative study of the legal systems in five countries, a book about Mexico and one on the trial of the English doctor whose wealthy patients (mainly female) kept mysteriously dying, though not before writing him into their wills. She also covered the trial of Jack Ruby, the obscenity case against “Lady Chatterley’s Lover,” and the 14-month long prosecution of the guards at Auschwitz—when, that is, not writing about food or wine.<br />The cost of having survived the 20th century weighed on her. “Those who have got off lightly paid perhaps too little (because there never can be enough?),” she wrote. “I feel I am one of those.” Never complacent, she drew on her own experience not because it was what she knew, though there was that, but because she wanted to understand why and how individuals and countries behave brutally, without mercy or justice, and how now and then they can surprise us with compassion or a sense of fair play. Her subject, then, was individual history writ large: her running theme, responsibility. “Nothing happens without consequences” is the epigraph of “Quicksands,” her last book, published in 2005, the year before she died, just shy of her 95th birthday.<br />Drawing on the extensive Bedford archive at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas-Austin, Selina Hastings, acclaimed biographer of Somerset Maugham and Nancy Mitford, fills in many of the blanks that Bedford, basically a reticent person, left even when writing obliquely of herself and a wide circle that included Martha Gellhorn and Thomas Mann. Gracefully written, largely sympathetic and very gossipy, “Sybille Bedford: A Life” takes as its point of departure Bedford’s quip to an interviewer: “I wish I’d written more books and spent less time being in love. It’s very difficult doing both at the same time.”<br />Perhaps, but she did write, often and well. Though afflicted with self-doubt, she was convinced from childhood that being a writer was an exalted profession, one endorsed by her mother, Elisabeth (Lisa) Bernhardt, a writer manquée at the center of all four of Bedford’s novels. From a wealthy Jewish family in Hamburg, the brilliant and by all accounts beautiful Lisa had married the elegant widower Baron Maximilian von Schoenebeck, whom she met in Berlin, in 1910, while recovering from an affair with a married man. Bernhardt and Schoenebeck were mismatched from the start; she was passionate about life and could talk about Dostoevsky at breakfast. Reserved and withdrawn, he was so chivalrous that he tipped his hat to the donkey when they passed. Before Lisa could bolt, as she planned to do, their daughter, Sybille, arrived in 1911; the baron had hoped for a son.<br />Bedford’s parents divorced in 1922. Bedford remained with her lonely father at the schloss Lisa had purchased in the German village of Feldkirch. But war had devastated the region and the German economy was in shambles. Father and daughter managed to survive by planting potatoes and trading apples and cider for bread and candles. Evenings, her father taught Sybille the proper way to draw the cork from the wine bottles still sequestered in the cellar, and played roulette with Sybille on a real wheel. Mornings, he discreetly replaced her cache of coins. But when the baron suddenly died in 1925, Sybille joined her freewheeling, imperious mother in Italy, where she had married young Norberto Marchesani.</td>

      <td>Researching the life of a high-ranking Nazi, the author comes to know the man’s son—ﬁrst amiably, then contentiously.</td>
      <td>In ‘East West Street’ (2016), the British human-rights lawyer Philippe Sands discovered the story of a man who had maintained a lifelong silence about his own story: his maternal grandfather, a Jew who in 1939 was forced to flee to Paris, where he survived the German occupation with false papers. The book interweaves this narrative with an account of the two legal minds who introduced the terms “genocide” and “crimes against humanity” into international law. Each of the three men had come from Galicia, a region at the eastern edge of the Habsburg Empire; each suffered grievous losses of family members at the hands of the province’s Nazi rulers. Less than 3% of Galicia’s prewar Jewish population survived.<br />In “The Ratline,” Mr. Sands again takes a biographical approach to history, relating two life-stories that collide and reverberate to staggering effect—and Galicia is again at the center of the drama. The first tells of the meteoric rise of Otto Wächter, an Austrian lawyer and high-ranking Nazi who governed Galicia during World War II. The second describes Otto’s son, Horst, whom Mr. Sands has come to know personally and who, Mr. Sands writes, remains “unwilling to countenance the idea that Otto Wächter bore any real responsibility for terrible events that occurred on the territory he ruled.”<br />Otto Wächter joined the Nazi Party in 1923, at age 22, and the SS (the Nazis’ elite paramilitary force) in 1932. Several months later he married Charlotte Bleckmann, a steel magnate’s daughter and art student. During their courtship, she gave him a copy of Hitler’s “Mein Kampf,” inscribed: “Through struggle and love, to the finish.”<br />In July 1934, Otto Wächter led a group of Austrian Nazis in a coup attempt that led to the assassination of Engelbert Dollfuss, the Austrian chancellor. Indicted for treason, he fled to Berlin, where he served in the headquarters of the SD, the intelligence service of the SS, working in the same building as Adolf Eichmann. His personnel file praised both his diligence and his “racial characteristics,” describing Otto as “tall, slender, with Nordic appearance.” After the March 1938 Anschluss, joining Austria and Germany, Otto returned to Vienna to purge the Austrian civil service of Jews and “undesirables.” “Otto dismissed or reprimanded at least 16,237 civil servants,” Mr. Sands writes, including some of his former law professors.<br />A month after the outbreak of war in 1939, Austrian Nazi leader Arthur Seyss-Inquart—Otto’s close comrade and Horst’s godfather—recommended Otto Wächter for the governorship of Krakow, one of five districts of newly conquered Poland. As governor, he ordered reprisal shootings of Polish civilians, expelled tens of thousands of Jews from Krakow, and created the city’s ghetto for those who remained. In December 1941, Hans Frank, governor-general of occupied Poland, convened a meeting with senior Nazis, Otto among them, to announce a new policy: “the total elimination of the Jews.” Four days later, Otto wrote to Frank: “It will bring me great joy and proud satisfaction, in the coming year, to work as a loyal follower on your project.”</td>

      <td>A Danish writer’s autobiographical fiction immerses the reader in her troubled experience, moment by moment.</td>
      <td>The calculus of literary revival is complicated by so many variables that no one can ever quite say why some books strike a chord and some don’t. Consider “The Copenhagen Trilogy” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 370 pages, $30) by Tove Ditlevsen, originally published between 1967 and 1971. Ditlevsen (1917-1976) was a celebrated postwar Danish writer whose profuse output continued throughout her troubled life until her death from an overdose of sleeping pills when she was 58. In 1985 Tiina Nunnally translated and published the first two volumes of the autobiographical trilogy (“Childhood” and “Youth”) in a single book titled “Early Spring,” which disappeared with hardly a ripple. But last year Ms. Nunnally’s versions were joined with Michael Favala Goldman’s translation of the third volume, “Dependency,” and published in the U.K. to extravagant critical acclaim. The praise has wafted into the U.S., where the work now arrives in a pricy hardcover from the country’s most prestigious publishing house—50-year-old Danish esoterica refashioned into one of the most anticipated releases of the season.<br />There’s little doubt that the newfound interest has to do with the ascendancy of what is now called autofiction, a genre whose overlooked pioneers were mostly women. (Though if it were as simple as that, why haven’t the sporadic attempts to bring back Marguerite Duras borne any fruit?) Ditlevsen is being positioned as a forerunner to Karl Ove Knausgaard, another saturnine Scandinavian self-chronicler. With the same naked candor as Mr. Knausgaard, but with a capacity for distillation entirely absent from his six-volume “My Struggle,” Ditlevsen recounts her impoverished upbringing in working-class Copenhagen, the stifling conditions of her girlhood, and the salvation she discovered at an early age in writing.<br />Ditlevsen called these books memoirs, but their embellishments—she changes the year of her birth, for instance—make them functionally identical to autobiographical fiction. A double life is established from the outset. Tove’s waking world is dreary, estranged, frightening and confined. “Childhood is long and narrow like a coffin, and you can’t get out of it on your own,” she says, yet it comes to look like paradise compared to the office drudgery and household chores that make up her prospects in adulthood.<br />But at the age of 10 she begins writing poetry and is instantly besotted with the feeling of escape into her imagination, where she enjoys complete control. A fraught symbiosis connects the trilogy’s parallel tracks: The real world becomes increasingly disastrous and intolerable, but Tove needs it to give her material for the catharsis of writing, just as, in the harrowing final volume, she comes to need physical suffering to justify her addiction to painkillers.<br />The gradual submersion into addiction and madness is brilliantly accomplished, though it’s a bitter, claustrophobic kind of excellence. Think of Jean Rhys rather than Proust—there are no poetic reveries about abjection here, no meandering modifying clauses. Ditlevsen writes firm, direct, often monotonous sentences that march the reader through the scenes at such a businesslike gait that one fails to notice just how far removed from rational behavior Tove has strayed. (At one point she consents to an unnecessary ear operation that leaves her half deaf because she knows it will get her more drugs.) There is no detached authorial intelligence commenting on what happens, nor is there much narrative interiority. Like Tove herself, the reader is balanced on the surface of the moment, appallingly captive to events as they unfold.</td>

      <td>As Edward VIII made his plans for marriage clear, even his bride-to-be worried the price would be too high.</td>
      <td>Alexander Larman opens “The Crown in Crisis” with a gleeful quote about the abdication of Edward VIII from Evelyn Waugh’s diary: “There can seldom have been an event that has caused so much general delight and so little pain.” Even now, over 80 years later, the saga of the king and the much reviled, twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson continues to entertain. The public has never tired of hearing about anything that concerns the British monarchy—but this scandal has proven a particularly enduring hit. In his fresh chronicle of the dramatic events leading up to the abdication, Mr. Larman, a historian and journalist, has unearthed newly released archives, unpublished letters and interviews with people who knew the couple.<br />The subject of the abdication did cause pain to some, in particular the king’s mother, Queen Mary. “This is a pretty kettle of fish,” she commented to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. For her, the monarchy was sacred, an obligation that inexorably came before self. But on Dec. 11, 1936, after less than a year as king, Edward took up a microphone and stated that he had renounced the throne, declaring that he could not fulfill his duties without the woman he loved by his side.<br />Mr. Larman calls Edward one of the least distinguished figures ever to have reigned in Britain: “He lived ultimately for his own desires and pleasure.” There were many, including his disapproving father, some of his own aides, and in the end even Wallis Simpson, who thought the country would be better off without him on the throne. He was charismatic and popular but also a liability—reckless, outspoken and unpredictable. He left confidential state papers carelessly scattered around for days in full view of guests at Fort Belvedere, his estate in Surrey. He consorted with the fascist leader Oswald Mosley and seemed sympathetic to Nazis hoping for a British alliance. He saw Hitler as, in Larman’s phrase, a “vigorous reformer.” He discussed everything with Wallis, while she was said to be in the pocket of the German Ambassador Joachim von Ribbentrop (who, given to social gaffes, was known as Ambassador Brickendrop).<br />Baldwin, Edward’s private secretary Alec Hardinge and the Archbishop of Canterbury stood against the king, who, they felt, could not be relied upon to restrain himself and act in the nation’s interest. Winston Churchill and the powerful newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook took Edward’s side. At first Edward offered no hint to Beaverbrook or anyone else that he would ask Wallis to marry him. Baldwin feared that if he did so, the British public would reject her and the government would be forced to resign. Hitler, meanwhile, was all for Edward and complained that “plutocrats and Marxists” were attempting to frustrate his desire to marry “a girl of the people,” perhaps not the best choice of words to describe the socially adept, status-minded Wallis.<br />One of Mr. Larman’s most interesting revelations concerns an attempt on Edward’s life. The would-be killer, working under the assumed name of George McMahon, was an alcoholic and a double agent for MI5. On July 16, 1936, the king, on horseback, had been inspecting the Guardsmen in Hyde Park when McMahon jumped out of the crowd and pointed a gun at him. A woman grabbed his arm and a policeman knocked it out of his hands. At his trial, McMahon claimed that “a foreign power” had paid him to kill the king and he had deliberately bungled the job. Dismissed as an attention-seeker and a fantasist, he was sentenced to 12 months hard labor.</td>

      <td>The tragedy of ‘Padma Lalli’ points at the danger many Indian women face, right at home.</td>
      <td>On the morning of May 28, 2014, two girls—cousins age 16 and 14—were found hanging from a mango tree in a remote village six hours southeast of New Delhi. They’d left their scruffy family compound the night before, telling the adults they needed to relieve themselves in the fields nearby. Like every other dwelling in this part of Uttar Pradesh—India’s most populous state and among its most impoverished—their home had no toilet.<br />The girls, Padma and Lalli, were so inseparable that they were known to the villagers simply as “Padma Lalli,” a portmanteau-name bestowed on them as if they were a single person. Before they went to the fields that night, Padma (the older one) had complained of a stomach ache. “Me too!” chimed Lalli, and off they went. They never returned. Their mothers barely gave them a glance as they left, assuming there would be other women in the fields “taking a final squat for the night.” Besides, Padma had a cellphone, lent to her by Lalli’s father—her uncle.<br />That we know such intimate detail is thanks to Sonia Faleiro, an Indian journalist based in London who has assembled the story of Padma and Lalli—piece by harrowing piece—in “The Good Girls: An Ordinary Killing.” Ms. Faleiro had set out to write a book about the epidemic of rape that has beset 21st-century India. The issue had first caught the world’s attention in 2012 when a young medical student was abducted in New Delhi, gang-raped in a bus and murdered with indescribable brutality. Ms. Faleiro had intended to focus on that episode, but the more she examined the tragedy of “Padma Lalli,” whom everyone presumed had also been raped, the more she was sucked into its vortex—to the exclusion of all else.<br />Ms. Faleiro has interviewed practically everyone connected with the deaths to produce a storyline in which different versions of the truth jostle for credibility. A cousin said there were thieves in the field where the girls went at night. Another man contradicted him. A 19-year-old from a neighboring village, Pappu Yadav, was said to have been there with the girls. He denied it, even as he became the prime suspect. A relative gave Pappu an alibi, which the fathers of the girls challenged as false. Someone else said he’d seen Pappu flirt with Padma on the day she disappeared. This desperate duel of accusers and deniers was overseen by the local police, frequently drunk on duty, who belonged to the same Yadav caste as Pappu. Naturally, they were seen as untrustworthy by the girls’ families—who are Shakya, a caste that lies low in the Hindu pecking order alongside the Yadavs.<br />“The Good Girls” is a riveting—sometimes astonishing—work of forensic journalism that chronicles the girls’ lives as well as the circumstances of their death. It highlights the values that prevail in rural north India, particularly the suffocating codes of honor that dictate what women shouldn’t do.</td>

      <td>Picturing the Jazz Age with the classic story of American self-invention.</td>
      <td>Something’s always lost when a book gets translated into a film, stage show or graphic novel. But something’s often gained, too, as is manifestly the case with K. Woodman-Maynard’s illustrated adaptation of “The Great Gatsby” (Candlewick, 232 pages, $24.99). The book is rendered in luxe colors of rose, gold, amethyst and aquamarine, making us feel as though we’re watching the events of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel through gems held up to the light.<br />Amid these washes of color, the graphic-novel format allows Fitzgerald’s metaphors to show themselves with intriguing clarity. For instance, the woman whom Jay Gatsby adores, Daisy Buchanan, famously has a melodic voice that’s “full of money.” In this telling, we can see that from the ripples and curlicues of Daisy’s speech bubbles. There’s also a wonderful early moment when the book’s narrator, Nick Carraway, enters the Buchanan mansion and sees Daisy and her friend Jordan slim and languid on a sofa, “as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.” Ms. Woodman-Maynard is able, of course, to show the Jazz Age beauties actually mid-flight, soaring and subsiding (see Daisy, below).<br />The book’s most striking use of illustration, however, comes at the end with the well-known passage: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy [Buchanan]—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money. Or their vast carelessness. Or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they made.” These words are accompanied by the sight of Daisy skipping elegantly, even playfully, past broken bottles, strewn bodies and the wreck of an automobile. Having been altered and condensed to suit the graphic-novel form, this “Gatsby” won’t be ideal for newcomers, but as an adjunct or a fresh way of experiencing a canonical story, readers ages 14 and older will find it hugely rewarding.<br />Both pictures and story are relatively straightforward in “Be More Chill” (Hyperion, 142 pages, $21.99), a graphic-novel version of the 2004 novel by Ned Vizzini that was also made into a 2019 Broadway musical. Adapted by David Levithan and illustrated by cartoonist Nick Bertozzi, the story features a nerdy, lovelorn teenager named Jeremy Heere who’s the butt of high-school social life. So when Jeremy learns about an ingestible black-market nanocomputer that can make him cool and popular from a boy who’s got one, he’s in.<br />Soon, in his quest for love and status, Jeremy is answering to an inner algorithm that tells him when to smile, what to say and whom to ignore. And for a while, his gambit seems to be working. But unpleasant side effects begin to accumulate, not only for Jeremy but for the boy who egged him on. The pacing is not ideal, so we don’t feel the full emotional impact of a tragedy involving that boy or, for that matter, of a later farce involving Jeremy; but still, for readers ages 13 and older, this is a sharp, cautionary tale about the wisdom of resisting quick fixes and accepting one’s own quirky humanity.</td>

      <td>Jackson Lamb and the other ’slow horses’ are expendable assets in a cynical covert struggle.</td>
      <td>Like Patrick O’Brian, who ultimately found his sweet spot in the Royal Navy of the early 19th century, Mick Herron eventually found his in Britain’s domestic intelligence service of the present day. Out of a wickedly imagined version of MI5, he has spun works of diabolical plotting and high-spirited cynicism, their pages filled with sardonic wit, their characters approaching the surreal. Up until a little over 10 years ago, Mr. Herron had produced a four-novel sequence starring a female PI, a stand-alone spy novel involving MI6 and a collection of short stories. Though entertaining enough, the books lack the animating genius of the seven novels and three novellas that make up his current series. Inevitably, and we hope with an appropriate degree of mordant humor, the books are now the basis for a television series, coming from Apple, starring Gary Oldman, Olivia Cooke, Kristin Scott Thomas, Jonathan Pryce and Jack Lowden.<br />“Slough House” is the latest installment. At its center is the selfsame Slough House, a decrepit building and moribund home to a collection of losers, screwups and scapegoats unfondly referred to as the “slow horses.” The presiding deity of this “administrative oubliette of the Intelligence Service” is Jackson Lamb, a former spy—or “joe,” in the bespoke lingo of the Slough House universe. Nasty, brutish and fat, he is, nonetheless, ahead of every game, a master of legerdemain who can produce a cigarette, a gun or himself seemingly out of thin air. Though he berates and belittles his minions, he is, in the end, intensely loyal to them, and a miraculous appearance by this repulsive man has time and again saved the day.<br />Sharing center stage with Lamb in the series is River Cartwright, whose early career was blown up by a training exercise gone terribly wrong thanks to the machinations of a rival. River is the grandson of David Cartwright, aka the O.B. or Old Bastard, a legendary Cold War spy who brought River up when his mother vamoosed and his father—well, that’s a story I cannot reveal. Among River’s fellow exiles are a former drunk with a “wine-dark past,” a violent cocaine addict, a nymphomaniac, a self-styled action hero and computer nerd, a compulsive gambler, a traumatized, murderous loner and other poor saps who have run afoul of the big bugs in the Service. As mortality is high among these unfortunates, it is best to read the books in order.<br />Pitted against Slough House is Regent’s Park, headquarters of the Service. It can be said to operate under London Rules, an informal credo whose first tenet is “cover your arse.” All other rules follow from that, and the agency’s big shots have no scruples about sacrificing personnel to cover up blunders and maleficence. For a time the Park’s senior official was Dame Ingrid Tearney, “a sweet old lady who drank fresh blood for breakfast.” A grotesque little creature, she occupied First Desk—the Service’s top spot in its own parlance—until she was ousted some books ago.<br />Before Dame Ingrid was forced from the scene, she articulated as plainly as anyone the altered mission of today’s intelligence service:</td>

      <td>No single force ousted Iranian leader Mohammad Mossadeq, but in the end only one man stood to benefit.</td>
      <td>Weaving conspiracy theories is a kind of art form in parts of the Middle East, and the Iranians are the undisputed masters. So pervasive is conspiracy theorizing in Iran that the “Encyclopaedia Iranica,” a scholarly guide to the country’s history and culture, contains a long and learned article documenting the many influential writers who attribute “the course of Persian history and politics to the machinations of hostile foreign powers and secret organizations.”<br />In their own style, Western writers, too, display a pronounced tendency to depict foreign decision-making as the main driver of modern Iran’s political history. Thus the Eurocentrism of Westerners and the conspiracy theorizing of Iranians work in parallel to produce histories that relegate Iranian leaders to bit parts in their own national drama.<br />Remedying this deficiency is the unstated but clear goal of Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a leading American analyst of contemporary Iran. His fifth book, “The Last Shah: America, Iran, and the Fall of the Pahlavi Dynasty,” offers an original interpretation that puts Iranian actors where they belong: at center stage. Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi is the main character, but Mr. Takeyh’s analysis rests on his portrayal of the traditional Iranian aristocracy—“the landlords, merchants, urban notables, and clerics” who helped the shah come to power in 1941 but whom he destroyed in the 1960s.<br />The shah regarded the traditional elite as an anachronistic impediment to modern government. To be sure, the aristocrats were fractious, scheming and zealously protective of their privileges, but along with their self-interest came a measure of social responsibility. In Mr. Takeyh’s view, their wealth was “tied to the land,” so they “could sense the peasants’ and laborers’ grievances and often responded to their distress.” They were the sinew connecting the big cities to the countryside.<br />And they were patriots. They deserve credit, Mr. Takeyh argues, for achievements routinely ascribed to foreigners—such as convincing Joseph Stalin to honor his wartime pledges to withdraw from the Iranian province of Azerbaijan, the arena of the first major standoff between the West and Moscow in the Cold War. Historians frequently cite President Truman’s get-tough policy as the cause of Stalin’s retreat, but Mr. Takeyh gives equal attention to the deft diplomacy of Iran’s prime minister, Ahmad Qavam. A talented aristocrat, Qavam persuaded Stalin that Soviet interests would best be achieved by supporting Iranian independence.</td>

      <td>Selected by the author of ‘Architects of Power: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and the American Century.’</td>
      <td>By Edmund Wilson (5 vols., 1975-93)<br />1. In the late 1960s Edmund Wilson began sorting through his voluminous journals and notebooks, to supplement his memoirs. But the project was unfinished at his death and taken up by editors Leon Edel and, later, Lewis M. Dabney in five volumes that remain the best, certainly the most entertaining, account of the literary life in the middle of the 20th century. Even as a Princeton undergraduate Wilson had a critical sense, jaundiced eye and natural pre-eminence. He seemed to know everybody in bohemian Greenwich Village, he turned up everywhere in Depression-era America and Europe, and he followed the cultural politics of the Cold War. His dismay at Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.’s delight in serving as Camelot’s cruise director is hilarious. And the occasionally hurried tone gives the journals a brutal concision and candor: Meeting Truman Capote at a party, in 1964, he doesn’t immediately recognize the “tiny little man with a high piping voice. . . . When he had come to see us at Wellfleet, he had seemed to me a not unpleasant little monster, like a fetus with a big head. But now he seemed more birdlike, as if his head had shrunk.”<br />(3 vols., 1940-43)<br />2. By the late 1930s H.L. Mencken was no longer an enfant terrible and scourge of the booboisie but an aging newspaperman out of step with New Deal America and inclined to look backward. In the space of four years he produced three volumes of personal memoirs—“Happy Days” (1940), “Newspaper Days” (1941) and “Heathen Days” (1943)—which, as sometimes happens with journalists, have little to do with the substance of his journalism but are the best things he ever wrote. Here Mencken’s rhetorical mannerisms are under control and his tone is consistently detached, often wise, always laconic and funny. My preference is for the middle volume where, as a baby reporter-editor in Baltimore, he inhabits the Hobbesian world of the turn-of-the-century newspaper trade. A favorite chapter, “Recollections of Notable Cops,” reveals that little has changed in the past century. Describing the comic semi-literacy of Baltimore’s finest, he reflects on their innocence of formal education, which was not a sign of stupidity because, he notes, “from some of them, in fact, I learned the valuable lesson that sharp wits can lurk in unpolished skulls.”<br />By William Alexander Percy (1941)</td>

      <td>Wednesday’s ceremony instantly boosted lesser-known designers like Batsheva Hay who dressed Ella Emhoff and Sergio Hudson who created Michelle Obama’s look, spiking sales and social-media buzz. Here, a guide to these rising stars.</td>
      <td>THE FASHION at Wednesday’s inauguration put American designers front and center, including several emerging American designers—who particularly stand to benefit from the attention. President Joe Biden’s Ralph Lauren suit got respectful reviews, but outfits designed by Sergio Hudson and Alexandra O’Neill, names far less widely known, were singled out for special praise. This level of exposure can make a huge difference, said Ikram Goldman, the Chicago retailer who gravitated to the work of many undersung designers when helping style Michelle Obama during the Obama administration. “These are unknown designers that are being worn by people in the limelight,” she pointed out, “and that combination...makes an impact on a lot of levels.”<br />Chief among them, sales. Batsheva Hay, who designed the high-necked burgundy dress worn by Ella Emhoff—the stepdaughter of Vice President Kamala Harris—said her e-commerce transactions started reaching record highs after the inauguration: “Compared to a regular day, I did at least five times as many sales on my website.” Ms. Hay is seeing unprecedented levels of interest manifest in other ways, too. A photo she posted on Instagram of Ms. Emhoff in her dress garnered more than 12,000 likes, thousands more than her typical posts.<br />Online interest also spiked for the family team behind the ornate, bird-adorned ring worn by poet Amanda Gorman. “We had the most people we’ve ever had on our website yesterday,” said Octavia Giovannini-Torelli, who runs the jewelry line Of Rare Origin with her mother and sister. “We’re responding to every single client who has reached out.” Since Wednesday, their website has featured a banner that reads: “We’re honored (and freaking out) to have a birds-eye-view at this historic Inauguration.”<br />Sergio Hudson, the Los Angeles-based designer who created the plum outfit that Michelle Obama wore at Wednesday’s inauguration and the black cocktail dress that Vice President Harris wore that evening, said his Instagram following multiplied from around 50,000 to over 130,000 in the hours following the inauguration. He says he’s barely had a chance to check sales and web traffic between all the interviews that have resulted.<br />The increased attention is especially welcome after a year that, thanks to the pandemic’s impact, ranks as one of the fashion business’s worst. “It means validity in the industry at a time where I feel like the industry is struggling,” Mr. Hudson said. “The past year has been scary. You’ve wanted to be a designer your entire life and then in one year you’re like, watching the whole industry collapse….This shows people still believe in fashion.”</td>

      <td>Most might not be inoculated until 2022, though Biden administration’s efforts and vaccines in development could quicken pace</td>
      <td>The U.S. has been administering doses of the Covid-19 vaccine since mid-December. As health departments across the country get their vaccination efforts up and running—some more successfully than others—President Biden’s administration is hoping to quicken the process.<br />As of mid-January, there was an average of almost 900,000 people getting their first doses of the vaccine each day. This pace might change, but based on the recent rate, it might take a year—until January 2022—for every American to get at least one shot, according to data analyzed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The projection provides a snapshot at the current trajectory, although it is conceivable that not everyone will receive a vaccine. The projection overstates the current progress because the two vaccines currently approved for emergency use in the U.S.—one made by  Pfizer Inc.  and its partner  BioNTech SE  and the other developed by  Moderna Inc. —require two doses for full vaccination.<br />Since mid-December, more than 14 million people—about 4% of the population—have received at least one dose as of Jan. 20, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />A vaccine from  Johnson & Johnson ,  which could seek U.S. emergency-use authorization as soon as February, only requires a single dose and could shorten the projection. Moreover, the rate of vaccination has been improving, with the first three weeks of the rollout averaging about 216,000 a day.</td>

Still, they reinforce the possibility that vaccine makers and regulators will need to update Covid-19 vaccines as the virus evolves.<br />A fourth study, conducted by scientists at  BioNTech  SE and  Pfizer Inc.  and published by the companies, showed that their vaccine successfully neutralized a variant that was initially detected in the U.K. That study didn’t include the South African strain.<br />The U.K. variant has already spread to many other countries, including the U.S.<br />More than a year into the pandemic, the discovery of new variants that appear to have made the virus more contagious is forcing researchers to adapt their understanding of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. One concern, researchers said, is that the new strains are emerging in countries where a significant percentage of people have already built up an immune response to earlier variants after getting Covid-19.</td>

The palace has traditionally held an almost sacred status in Thai society. But many in the new protest movement see the crown as part of the royalist-military elite that, they say, is holding back democratic progress in their country rocked by frequent coups and political turmoil.</td>
