      <td>Company backed by Chinese, U.S. investors has filed confidential IPO papers</td>
      <td>Autonomous trucking company TuSimple Inc., which gained momentum with hundreds of millions of dollars in financing from Chinese investors and U.S. freight-hauling companies, has filed paperwork to go public and plans to join the U.S. stock market as early as next month, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The company, which has offices in San Diego and China, has filed confidentially for an IPO and plans to make that filing public in early March and will list its shares for trading a few weeks later, the people said. That schedule is subject to change and market conditions could alter TuSimple’s plans.<br />Morgan Stanley  is the lead banker on the IPO, the people said. TuSimple said it raised $215 million in a 2019 financing round that valued it at $1.2 billion. It has since raised more capital but declined to share its latest valuation. Other financial details about the coming IPO weren’t immediately available.<br />A spokeswoman for TuSimple declined to comment on the company’s IPO plans.<br />The IPO filing confirms TuSimple’s intention to pursue a traditional public listing versus merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which is also known as a blank-check company. Last year, TuSimple considered going public with a SPAC, people with knowledge of the discussions said.</td>

      <td>Filings for initial unemployment claims have held at a high level since the start of the year and could for a few weeks be affected by job disruptions from severe winter storms across the country.<br />Economists project initial jobless claims to regular state programs, a proxy for layoffs, to hold nearly steady for the week ended Feb. 20, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. The Labor Department will publish the latest data at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday.<br />The four-week moving average, which smooths out week-to-week fluctuations, was 833,000 in the week ended Feb. 13, within the roughly 750,000 to 850,000 range that has held since last October and above the pre-pandemic peak.<br />The recent data is broadly consistent with a labor market that has been stuck near neutral this winter, while other readings of the economy have pointed to a pickup.<br />Jobless claims are closely watched by policy makers and investors about the direction of the jobs market and overall economy, but winter storms that hit Texas and elsewhere could affect layoff trends in the short term. The storms, which caused widespread power outages and disruptions, could create temporary unemployment for some workers and may have made it difficult for people to file claims and for state governments to process them.</td>

      <td>U.S. stock futures were mixed Thursday ahead of fresh data on the economic growth, jobless claims and the manufacturing sector, which will offer fresh insights into the pace of recovery.<br />Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.2%, suggesting that the blue-chips index may climb to another record after closing Wednesday at an all-time high. Contracts linked to the S&P 500 were relatively flat. Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.4%, suggesting declines in tech stocks after the opening bell.<br />Investors’ appetite for risky assets rebounded on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments this week that the central bank will keep interest rates low for a while. Optimism about the economic recovery and a sharp rise in bond yields—which closed Wednesday at their highest level in a year—is prompting money managers to shift funds into stocks that are likely to benefit from a rebound this year. That has weighed on technology shares, which powered much of last year’s rally.<br />“The rise in bond yields triggers this rotation, away from growth stocks and more in favor of value stocks,” said Sophie Chardon, cross asset strategist at Lombard Odier. “The rise in yields is supportive for banks, higher oil prices are supportive for energy. It is a change of leadership.”<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.413%, from 1.388% on Wednesday. The yield on government bonds has been on the rise as investors cut their holdings of the safest assets.</td>

      <td>Netflix Inc.  will invest $500 million this year in South Korean films and TV series, tapping one of Asia’s cultural powerhouses as global competition for viewers attracts more rival services and expands beyond American content.<br />It is one of Netflix’s most significant overseas investments in recent years. The spending also marks a deeper commitment to a South Korean entertainment industry enjoying heightened prominence following the surprise success of the film “Parasite,” which last year won four Oscars including best picture—the first non-English-language film to do so.<br />Between 2015 and 2020, Netflix spent about $700 million on Korean content, on both licensing outside titles and making about 80 original films and TV series.<br />That includes a three-year partnership with one of South Korea’s major entertainment companies, CJ ENM Co., plus its production subsidiary Studio Dragon Corp. The deal has already produced hits such as “Sweet Home,” an apocalyptic suspense series. It has been watched by more than 22 million Netflix member households after its December debut, Netflix said last month, making it one of the Los Gatos, Calif.-based company’s more popular Korean-produced shows.<br />“Our commitment towards Korea is strong. We will continue to invest and collaborate with Korean storytellers across a wealth of genres and formats,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s co-chief executive officer, in an online press conference on Thursday.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden on Wednesday revoked most immigration restrictions that former President Donald Trump imposed last year in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The White House said it was revoking parts of a ban that blocked entry into the U.S. to family members of U.S. citizens, some immigrants with employment-based green cards and winners of the diversity visa lottery. Mr. Biden has left in place restrictions that block the entry of foreigners with several types of work-based visas including the H-1B visa for high-skilled foreign professionals. That aspect of the ban is set to expire on March 31.<br />The Trump administration, which imposed the ban on most forms of legal immigration in April and expanded it in June, said at the time it had been necessary to prevent foreigners from coming to the U.S. and taking jobs when unemployment had skyrocketed as a result of the pandemic. A Wall Street Journal review found the ban didn’t have the intended effect: Jobs allotted to foreigners, typically in high-skill roles as software engineers or seasonal positions such as working at a resort, went unfilled.<br />The ban “harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,’’ the White House said. “It also harms industries in the United States that utilize talent from around the world.’’<br />The revoked ban applied to applicants for U.S. permanent residency who are parents or siblings of U.S. citizens, along with applicants for several types of employment-based permanent residency cards, called green cards.</td>

Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Mike Braun of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri said a book by conservative scholar Ryan T. Anderson, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,” was no longer available on Amazon nor on its Kindle and Audible platforms.<br />Amazon, they wrote, has been “unable to provide a sufficient explanation” as to how the book “supposedly violated a vague, undefined ‘offensive content’ standard.”<br />An Amazon spokeswoman didn’t have a comment regarding the letter. The company declined to provide specifics regarding its decision, saying in a statement earlier Wednesday that it reserved the right not to sell certain content based on its content guidelines for books.<br />“All retailers make decisions about what selection they choose to offer and we do not take selection decisions lightly,” the statement said.</td>

That is about half as much as it previously planned to buy.<br />But part of the deal not previously reported sets Mr. Neumann apart from other shareholders. It calls for SoftBank to give the 41-year-old the $50 million special payout and extend by five years a $430 million loan it made to him in late 2019, the people said. SoftBank is also slated to pay $50 million for Mr. Neumann’s legal fees. It isn’t clear how much it is paying for the other shareholders’ legal fees.<br />The settlement between SoftBank, Mr. Neumann and the other shareholders isn’t final and the terms could still change, the people cautioned. Should the parties reach agreement, potentially in the next few days, it would avert an early-March trial.<br />WeWork is separately negotiating a combination with a special-purpose acquisition company called BowX Acquisition Corp. that would provide the startup with a public listing, people familiar with the discussions said. While the talks could still fall apart and other options are being considered, WeWork and BowX could reach agreement as soon as next week, some of the people said.</td>

The agency received a draft version of the report in December.<br />The warning over ongoing issues comes during changes in global regulation of the aviation industry that include less reliance on approvals in an aircraft’s country of manufacture.<br />Boeing has had to push back the introduction of its newest jetliner, the 777X, partly because of extended certification issues related to the wide-body plane, the company said last month.</td>

      <td>A rally in everything from stocks to oil shows investors believe growth is coming</td>
      <td>Markets are signaling that an economy that plunged into its deepest recession in decades just a year ago is ready to roar.<br />Major U.S. stock indexes have set 32 record highs in 2021, including Wednesday’s 424-point surge by the Dow industrials to 31962. Long-term bond yields are rising, showing increasing demand for funds from consumers and businesses, and inflation expectations are at multiyear highs. The price of everything in markets, from a barrel of oil to a share of mall retailer GameStop Corp. to a bitcoin, seems to be going up.<br />And moments of caution have been short-lived. Earlier this week, investors sold tech stocks, concerned that the rising long-term interest rates brought by an improving economy would make tech less attractive—in effect, that the economic outlook was too good. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday reiterated that low rates would be around for a long time. Tech stocks promptly bounced.<br />The everything rally shows that investors believe the fun is just getting started. They believe that a combination of more fiscal stimulus, more-extensive Covid-19 vaccinations and pent-up demand for consumption, on a background of near record-low interest rates, will at last kick-start economic growth and inflation that have been elusive in recent years.<br />As the U.S. moves past the pandemic, markets are saying Americans will spend on big-ticket items such as vacations and weddings, companies will go on hiring sprees and the transition to new technologies such as electric vehicles will accelerate. The most optimistic investors believe the economy, just months after it was devastated by the pandemic, will bounce back in a manner akin to the Roaring ’20s.</td>

More than three dozen candidates have filed for the contest to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio, who will leave office at the end of this year due to term limits.

But a few ZIP Codes in Manhattan accounted for a large amount of high-dollar donations.<br />In the 10024 ZIP Code in Manhattan’s Upper West Side, 1,250 donors have given more than $514,000, according to the Campaign Finance Board records. The majority of donors in the ZIP Code gave to two Democratic mayoral candidates: city Comptroller Scott Stringer and Ray McGuire, a former vice chairman at Citigroup.<br />On Manhattan’s Upper East Side, 606 donors living in the 10021 ZIP Code gave a total of $472,986, records show. Most of the donations went to Mr. Stringer and Mr. McGuire, who isn’t participating in the public-matching-funds program run by the Campaign Finance Board.</td>

      <td>Inflation? What inflation? That was Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s main message to Congress and markets in two days of testimony this week, with a side order of modern monetary theory.<br />Mr. Powell told everyone not to worry about rising interest rates or soaring asset prices because he and the Fed aren’t worried. “The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved,” he said early and often.<br />He’s focusing the Fed instead on the full employment half of its mandate. Some 10 million jobs haven’t returned following the Covid-19 lockdowns of the past year, and Mr. Powell and other Fed board members aren’t wrong to suggest the data conceal many other people who have left the job market.<br />Yet Mr. Powell also thinks, or at least claims, that the Fed can solve this problem with monetary levers when the real fix will be when the vaccine rollout facilitates a rapid reopening of the economy. Mr. Powell thinks the economy could grow 6% or so this year. But he never explains why that growth wouldn’t naturally boost employment absent the Fed's interventions, or how stoking demand via successive government spending bills amid supply constraints won’t trigger inflation.<br />Mr. Powell also used the jobs issue to justify continued large-scale Fed purchases of mortgage-backed securities ($40 billion a month) and Treasury bonds ($80 billion). Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will be grateful. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal budget deficit will be $2.4 trillion this year under current law, and the Biden Administration’s $1.9 trillion spending bill would push it past $4 trillion.</td>

      <td>Stock is still well below its intraday peak of $483 in late January</td>
      <td>GameStop Corp.  shares skyrocketed higher in the final hour of trading Wednesday, finishing the day with a rally reminiscent of last month’s blockbuster gains.<br />Shares of the videogame retailer finished 104% higher to close at $91.71 after hovering below $50 for most of the day. The stock, which was halted twice on Wednesday for volatility, last traded at that level on Feb. 3.<br />A clear catalyst behind the sudden surge couldn’t be determined. The company said after markets closed Tuesday that its chief financial officer would resign March 26. GameStop in recent months has come under pressure to focus more heavily on e-commerce. Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen, who holds a nearly 13% stake in GameStop through his investment firm RC Ventures LLC, was recently added to the retailer’s board.<br />Since GameStop’s epic rise in late January, some individual investors have remained bullish on the stock and were re-energized when Keith Gill, the trader on Reddit known as DeepF—ingValue, disclosed that he had doubled down on the stock. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Gill posted a screenshot to Reddit showing that he had purchased an additional 50,000 shares of the stock. Following the news, the stock jumped 13% Monday.<br />Even with Wednesday’s surge, the stock is still trading more than 80% below its intraday peak of $483 in late January. Meanwhile, short interest in the stock has substantially diminished. As of Tuesday, short interest was roughly 39% of the stock’s free float, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That compares with well over 100% at the start of 2021.</td>

      <td>The Covid bill hides a major expansion of the Affordable Care Act.</td>
      <td>We’ve been telling readers about the progressive policy priorities hitching a ride on Congress’s “Covid relief” bill. That includes shoveling billions into the Affordable Care Act, with the goal of making government insurance a middle-class entitlement on the way to Medicare for All.<br />Provisions of the $1.9 trillion bill moving through the House make Affordable Care Act subsidies more generous and available even to the affluent. Buying an ObamaCare policy makes sense if a subsidy shields you from fearsome premiums and out-of-pocket costs; more than 85% of enrollees receive such a subsidy. But those who earn too much to qualify for government subsidies have been fleeing the exchanges. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicessaid last fall that unsubsidized enrollment dropped 45% between 2016 and 2019.<br />Instead of making the underlying product better or less expensive, Democrats now want to pass more of the cost onto taxpayers. More low-income buyers would pay little to nothing for insurance. Democrats would also remove the income cap for receiving subsidies, which is 400% of the poverty line, and reduce a person’s maximum contribution to 8.5% of income from 10%.<br />The ObamaCare “subsidy cliff” is poor policy that punishes Americans for working and earning more, but now government will spend scarce resources on those who don’t need help. Brian Blase of the Galen Institute has pointed out that a family of four headed by a 60-year-old earning $240,000 could qualify for a nearly $9,000 subsidy. These are not the folks hit hard by the pandemic, many of whom are eligible for Medicaid.<br />The supersized subsidies would cost $34 billion over two years but that is merely the beginning. The politics are such that the benefit will never be revoked. The more generous subsidies will be captured by insurers, who will continue to raise premiums, and the specter of high costs will push lawmakers to intervene again. Rinse, repeat. Smaller businesses may move their workers onto the exchanges instead of offering their own insurance.</td>

      <td>If it’s stacked with Democrats, it won’t be a credible inquiry.</td>
      <td>Nancy Pelosi wants a “9/11-type” commission to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, and there’s a case for doing it—if the goal is truly to find out why America’s seat of government was so poorly protected and how much of the violence was planned. Is that what Mrs. Pelosi is after?<br />There’s reason to doubt it, since she pushed to make the commission a partisan body. Her initial plan was to have seven members appointed by Democrats and four by Republicans. This is impossible to justify, especially in a country so closely divided. Democrats have 51% of House seats and Republicans have 49%, and the Senate is 50-50. Why, then, would Democrats get to appoint 64% of a Jan. 6 commission?<br />The only way an inquiry can defang disinformation and conspiracy theories, like the idea that the Capitol rioters were antifa agitators in disguise, is if the country thinks the effort is factual and fair. An even partisan split is crucial for credibility. Otherwise a sizable share of Americans will suspect it’s a political weapon designed to find President Trump guilty of incitement to insurrection, more or less, after a failed impeachment trial.<br />Mrs. Pelosi should want an inquiry that delivers a unanimous outcome, not one that breaks down on party lines. Heed the veterans of the 9/11 commission, which she invokes. Its Democratic vice chairman, former Rep. Lee Hamilton, told Politico that Mrs. Pelosi’s proposal “does not sound to me like a good start; it sounds like a partisan beginning.” Its GOP chairman, former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, said that without equal representation, “the report won’t have as much confidence from the American people.”<br />Another model is the 2005 Robb-Silberman report on faulty intelligence before the Iraq war. That commission followed the facts, instead of chasing a predetermined hypothesis. It was led by credible figures: Judge Laurence Silberman of the federal appeals court for the D.C. Circuit and former Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb.</td>

Mitt Romney’s son Taggart, as a partner. Solamere, a Boston firm with more than $1 billion in assets, seeks to invest in high-growth companies and help them expand and create jobs, he says. He was inclined to join the firm because it takes a conservative approach to adding debt to companies in its portfolio and eschews layoffs—two things private-equity firms are typically associated with.<br />“For 20 years in Congress, I’ve been preaching the virtues of the free-enterprise system,” Mr. Ryan said in an interview. “The reason I’m joining Solamere is that I want to practice what I preach.”<br />A SPAC is an empty vehicle that raises funds and then looks for a business to buy or merge with, usually within two years. Solamere Capital was the main sponsor of Mr. Ryan’s SPAC,  Executive Network Partnering Corp.<br />The vehicle, which raised about $360 million, is a twist on the traditional SPAC, with longer-term incentives for its backers and potentially slimmer fees for underwriters. Its founders won’t be able to sell any of their shares for three years after any merger closes; typically, SPAC founders can either sell a year after a merger closes or as soon as the shares trade above a certain level.</td>

She added that some inventories are likely to remain low in the first quarter even as Nvidia increases supply. “Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components,” Ms. Kress said.<br />President Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order directing a broad review of supply chains for semiconductors and other critical materials.</td>

      <td>Regulations forbid utilities from building energy resiliency.</td>
      <td>The Texas power crisis demonstrated the fragility of the nation’s electricity infrastructure. Outmoded policies and regulations have disabled the creation of a market for resiliency.<br />In most states, utilities are regulated monopolies. A Public Utility Commission sets rates based on state laws, many of which allow utilities to charge a premium for renewable electricity. That has induced utilities to install gigawatts of wind and solar capacity.<br />But there are no such incentives for resiliency. Not only aren’t utilities required to provide more-reliable power; they can’t offer resiliency at a higher price because rates are fixed. It is as if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn’t require air bags or seat belts and forbade automakers to charge a premium if these safety features were provided.<br />Worse, many states penalize customers who try to implement their own resiliency solutions. In California, essential businesses are forced to pay punitive charges to the utilities if they generate nonintermittent onsite power. PUCs and utilities suggest that these charges ensure that customers pay their “fair share” to fund wildfire mitigation and energy-efficiency programs.<br />To build a resilient power marketplace, lawmakers and PUCs should create incentives for resiliency, as they encouraged renewable energy. They should authorize higher rates for resilient electricity, so that utilities can make long-delayed infrastructure upgrades.</td>

At his first, in February 2011, he announced he was “thinking about” a White House bid because America had “become a whipping post for the rest of the world.” He had “participated in many battles” and “really almost come out very, very victorious every single time,” having “beaten many people and companies” and “intelligently earned many billions of dollars, which in a sense was both a scorecard and acknowledgment of my abilities.” He spontaneously called Rep. Ron Paul, winner of that year’s CPAC presidential straw poll, a loser with “zero chance of getting elected.” Sound familiar?<br />Mr. Trump didn’t run in 2012, but many themes of his 2016 campaign were there in his 2011 remarks: defeating China, ending dependence on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and promises to “blast” an American enemy—Somali pirates in that case—“so fast.”<br />Back then he was allowed only five minutes to talk. A prerogative of being the former president is he’ll have as much time he wants Sunday. How he uses it will be important.<br />One approach would be to devote the speech to his anger and grievances over losing the election. He could complain it was stolen and brag about winning more than 74 million votes. He could claim credit for every GOP victory, from flipping House seats to adding state legislative chambers, while blaming others—notably Minority Leader Mitch McConnell—for every GOP failure, including losing the Senate.</td>

Federal Judge Anthony R. Mautone subsequently dismissed the two charges during the hearing.<br />During the hearing, Mr. Springsteen pleaded guilty to the third charge of consuming alcohol in a closed area.

      <td>Italy, like the U.S., recently completed an experiment in populist government. The antiestablishment Five Star Movement and the anti-immigration League formed a coalition after elections in 2018, but it broke down after little more than a year. As in America, the new head of government is an establishment figure. But unlike President Biden, Prime Minister Mario Draghi is known less as a politician than a technocrat: an economist with a doctorate from MIT who has headed the Italian Treasury, Bank of Italy and European Central Bank. He stays off social media and seldom gives interviews or public speeches.<br />“When I was prime minister, Mario Draghi was director general of the Treasury. I know him personally and professionally,” Lamberto Dini told me. He led the government in 1995-96, “He is very reserved. He would call only when there was a problem to solve, and he would solve it. He is not just a technocrat; he is a great political figure.”<br />Mr. Draghi, 73, is best known for rescuing the euro during its debt crisis in 2012. He promised in a speech that the ECB would do “whatever it takes” to salvage the eurozone, which stopped international speculation against the currency.<br />This month President Sergio Mattarella appointed Mr. Draghi to head a national-unity government. Unlike in the U.S., there was no populist backlash against the new establishmentarian leader. Instead, the antiestablishment Five Star Movement and League were so eager to join the new cabinet that they abandoned their former euroskeptic positions. The coalition also includes the center-left Democratic Party, the free-market Forza Italia, and the democratic-socialist Free and Equal party. The only opposition party is the right-wing Brothers of Italy.<br />The unelected Mr. Draghi is popular with voters. According to a survey by Noto Sondaggi, a leading Italian pollster, 56% of Italians have confidence in him—the highest figure recorded in two decades. Markets seem to share the feeling: Benchmark Italian bond yields hit record lows after the appointment.</td>

It would consist of three members appointed by President Biden and another eight appointed by the four top congressional leaders, with each leader appointing two members.<br />Under that structure, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) would be able to choose only four of the 11 members, with the other seven in the hands of Democrats. The Republicans say that gives the commission a partisan tilt, in contrast to the 9/11 commission, which was evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats.<br />“Any undertaking along these lines must be fair and evenhanded,” Mr. McConnell said in criticizing the Democratic proposal. “That shouldn’t be controversial.”<br />“I understand the question about who appoints them—but it doesn’t necessarily mean that the president wouldn’t appoint someone with a different voter registration than our party,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar (D., Calif.), the vice chairman of the House Democratic caucus.</td>

      <td>The effort to bring data from the human genome into medical therapy and practice has been thrilling and frustrating.</td>
      <td>In the months after Carson Miller was born, his parents Danny and Nikki—a young couple living in Northern California—noticed that he was having trouble with basic movements, like rolling over and crawling. He managed to take a few steps at 12 months but never got beyond that. When his brother Chase was born a year later, the parents’ anxiety turned to dismay as the younger boy also struggled with motor activity. Desperate to understand what was wrong, Danny and Nikki took their wheelchair-bound children to a series of doctors, enduring test after test; yet a diagnosis remained elusive. Finally, the family saw a group of medical detectives—part of an academic consortium called the Undiagnosed Diseases Network—who subjected the family’s DNA to a comprehensive analysis. The doctors at last identified the problem: an unusual defect in the energy machinery of the boys’ cells. Diagnosis firmly in hand, the family could now turn their attention to treatment.<br />The fact that critical information lurks within the three billion or so pairs of letters representing our genetic instructions was a key driver of the Human Genome Project, begun in 1990 and completed, with suitable fanfare, 13 years later. But translating DNA sequence into actionable insight hasn’t been easy. This is a major theme of “The Genome Odyssey,” Euan Ashley’s impassioned, firsthand account of the effort to bring genomicdata into clinical practice and help patients like Carson and Chase.<br />For starters, says Dr. Ashley, a cardiologist and geneticist at Stanford, there was the price—prohibitively high early on. Thanks to advances in technology, the cost of sequencing an individual’s DNA has declined a million-fold since 2003—the equivalent, he says, of a Ferrari plummeting from $350,000 to less than 40 cents. The time required to decode a genome has plunged to days rather than years or months. When Jazlene, a newborn girl with a dangerously abnormal heart rhythm, arrived at Stanford in 2014, Dr. Ashley and his colleagues were able to identify the genetic cause within days and “practice more ‘precise’ medicine” by fine-tuning the infant’s therapy.<br />At the level of DNA, humans are 99.9% identical, Dr. Ashley reminds us. The challenge, for doctors, lies in figuring out which differences in the remaining 0.1% are medically pertinent. For many families, the diagnosis of a rare genetic disease marks the end of one journey and the beginning of a second one, focused on learning from similar patients and partnering with researchers to search for a cure.<br />While Dr. Ashley concentrates on genetic disease, he also highlights the promise of DNA “superhumans”—people who have been dealt an unusually good genetic hand. One example: Sharlayne Tracy, a college student in Dallas who enrolled in a University of Texas Southwestern study of cardiovascular health and was found to have astonishingly low levels of “bad” cholesterol. DNA analysis revealed a genetic defect disrupting PCSK9, a protein involved in cholesterol metabolism. The discovery prompted several pharmaceutical companies to develop medications targeting this protein. Two of the drugs, for the treatment of stubbornly high cholesterol, have been approved by the FDA.</td>

      <td>As Tiger Woods recovers from serious leg injuries suffered in a rollover accident Tuesday morning outside Los Angeles, the golf world is again trying to answer the question that has loomed over the sport for the better part of a decade.<br />Is Tiger done?<br />Woods underwent emergency surgery after he fractured bones in multiple places in the accident. He had a rod, screws and pins inserted to stabilize his leg, foot and ankle. He experienced trauma to his leg’s muscle and soft tissue.<br />The question of his golf future is difficult to answer because relatively little is known about his precise condition and so few athletes in history are even vaguely comparable to him.<br />It’s also not the first time Woods has faced such questions. They surfaced beginning in 2008, when knee surgeries derailed his career, and 2009, when he crashed an SUV into a fire hydrant and a tree amid what became an ugly public marital scandal. He suffered numerous other injuries over the ensuing years, including to his back and Achilles.</td>

He used intimidation to silence his critics. And if you dared to speak up, you would face consequences.”<br />Caitlin Girouard, a spokeswoman for the Democratic governor, said Wednesday that Ms. Boylan’s accusations were “quite simply false.”<br />In a Dec. 13 Twitter post, Ms. Boylan accused Mr. Cuomo of sexual harassment during her time working for the state, but she didn’t provide specific details.

      <td>Attorneys for company founder Elizabeth Holmes say prosecutors can’t prove fraud case without the results of millions of blood tests</td>
      <td>Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes is sparring with federal prosecutors over an inaccessible database recording millions of the company’s blood tests, arguing the government can’t prove the test results were unreliable without the database’s information.<br />If Ms. Holmes’s argument is successful, prosecutors could be blocked at her criminal trial in July from presenting testimony from patients who government lawyers say received inaccurate test results from the company. Without broader Theranos results from the database, the witness testimony would be anecdotal and irrelevant, her attorneys said in court filings Tuesday, because prosecutors can’t show that the firm’s blood tests were less accurate than those from other companies.<br />Federal prosecutors said in a filing last month that their case “is hardly ’anecdotal,’” and that they will show Theranos’s reliability and accuracy problems through whistleblowers and federal regulator reports, along with patient stories. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in 2016 that its inspection of Theranos’s lab found deficient practices that posed immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.<br />Ms. Holmes, once a star Silicon Valley entrepreneur, faces federal charges that she defrauded investors and patients about her company’s technology, which purported to use just a few drops of blood from a finger prick to test for a variety of health conditions. The Wall Street Journal first reported in 2015 that the company’s proprietary technology was unreliable and that the company conducted most of its tests on standard blood-testing machines that it sometimes modified.<br />Ms. Holmes and prosecutors agree that the database, known as the Laboratory Information System, no longer exists. They disagree, however, on how that came to be, and whether its absence is damaging to the prosecution.</td>

Every new Paramount movie would become available on the Paramount+ platform after appearing in theaters, he added.<br />“In short, if you love movies, Paramount+ is a streaming service that you can’t live without,” Mr. Bakish said.<br />ViacomCBS’s decision to shorten the theatrical window follows similar moves by rivals including  Walt Disney Co. ,  Comcast Corp.’s  NBCUniversal and  AT&T Inc.’s  WarnerMedia that are seeking to balance their lucrative theatrical exhibition businesses with the success of their own video-streaming services, which have become central to their owners’ corporate strategies.</td>

The study also found the vaccine is 92% effective in preventing severe disease.<br />The results are in line with the vaccine maker’s own clinical trial, but the large size of the study, which covered nearly 1.2 million people, provides more precise insight into older age groups that were sparsely covered by the drugmaker’s trial, according to the study’s authors.<br />The peer-reviewed study, parts of which have been reported previously, was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.<br />Israel is the only country that has begun vaccinating all age groups over 16 in relatively large numbers, as part of its campaign to inoculate a majority of its nine-million population by March.</td>

A shortage of the asset can degrade service, putting a carrier at a competitive disadvantage.<br />The most recent spectrum sale offered cellular companies, cable-TV providers and other qualified bidders a chance to expand their wireless operations into the C-band range, a swath of airwaves previously restricted to satellite communications.

Belk’s sprint through chapter 11 was the one of just a handful of cases that were completed in under 24 hours.<br />Prepackaged bankruptcy filings are popular because they take less time and cost less in administrative and professional fees.

      <td>U.S. foreign policy isn’t to blame for the mullahs’ deep-rooted hatred of America and Americans.</td>
      <td>Iran, Europe and many American progressives are pressuring the Biden administration to revive the 2015 nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. Official groupthink has coalesced around a singularly misguided belief: The U.S. has so badly mistreated Iran in the past that it must engage and appease the Islamic Republic now. I understand this view because I was once taught to believe it. This mindset is what convinced me in 2016 that I could safely do research for my dissertation in Iran. My optimism was misplaced. Not long after I arrived, I was imprisoned by Iran’s brutal regime and held hostage for more than three years.<br />When I went to Iran, I shared the prevailing academic view of the Middle East. I had absorbed the oft-repeated lesson that political Islam arose in response to Western colonialism and imperialism, and that the West—particularly America’s Middle East behavior—was chiefly responsible for the region’s chaos. My professors taught that the U.S. had treated Iran with a mixture of Orientalist condescension and imperialist aggression since the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979. I believed America’s role in the 1953 coup that removed Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh explained everything that had gone wrong in Iran. Convinced that the mullahs’ hostility toward the U.S. was exaggerated, I often dismissed allegations of the regime’s malign behavior as American propaganda.<br />Since it was obvious that American foreign policy itself was the problem, and that the regime would happily normalize relations once the U.S. pivoted away from disrespect, I assumed I’d be left alone in Iran if I remained apolitical and focused on historical research. Imagine my shock when the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence arrested me on false espionage charges in August 2016, shortly after the implementation of the JCPOA—during what appeared to be a period of rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran. I was thrown into solitary confinement, forced to confess things my interrogator knew I had not done, and sentenced to 10 years in prison.<br />My interrogator made clear that my sole “crime” was being an American. He told me I was to be used as a pawn in exchange for U.S.-held Iranian prisoners and the release of frozen Iranian assets. (I was released in a 2019 prisoner swap.)<br />My terrible 40-month imprisonment was a period of intense re-education about the relationship between Iran and the U.S. The Islamic Republic is an ambitious power, but not a constructive one. It’s a spoiler, projecting influence by exporting revolution and terrorism via its proxies in the Middle East. Domestically, the mullahs have failed to deliver on their political and economic promises to the Iranian people, on whom they maintain their grip through oppression.</td>

It provides services including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and selling and redeeming Treasury bills.<br />The Fed sent an alert to such customers at 12:43 p.m. ET of “a possible issue or disruption to multiple services.” In a subsequent alert, it said Fed staff became aware of “a disruption for all services” beginning around 11:15 a.m.</td>

      <td>After avoiding dementia dramas, a writer finds new perspectives in a spate of films exploring the disease in unconventional ways.</td>
      <td>My mother was the reason I initially resisted “The Father.” The new film stars Anthony Hopkins as a man struggling against the effects of dementia. That synopsis was enough to trip my avoidance instinct, despite the time that has passed since my mom’s death, on Feb. 18, 2017, at age 76 from Alzheimer’s disease.<br />I had learned all I wanted to know about dementia from her. Over seven years, I saw it change Joan Jurgensen from the captain of my family to a castaway adrift in time and place, who fussed over invisible children at her feet, grieved anew each time she learned that her parents died decades ago, and sang church hymns even after she struggled to form linear sentences.<br />But lately I’ve been re-examining that chapter, drawn in by the work of filmmakers using cinematic techniques—manipulations of time, perspective, setting and genre—to explore the interior worlds of dementia. With more and more people living with Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia (now nearly 6 million Americans, plus their caregivers) these movies show how reckonings with the disease in art are evolving.<br /><br />Last year’s “Relic,” from writer-director Natalie Erika James, is a horror movie set in a house mirroring the space inside its owner’s deteriorating mind. In “Elizabeth Is Missing,” a recent PBS movie starring Glenda Jackson, 84 years old, a woman’s memory loss is a plot device and a metaphor in her search for a vanished friend. In the format-bending documentary “Dick Johnson Is Dead,” filmmaker Kirsten Johnson grapples with the impending loss of her father by casting him in faux movie scenes, complete with stunt doubles and elaborate sets.</td>

      <td>He refused to apologize for fake transgressions and never lost his humor. More could follow his example.</td>
      <td>Rush Limbaugh is frequently credited with reviving talk radio in America, and that is true. But Limbaugh was also “patient zero” of today’s cancel culture, with dozens of efforts to kill his program for one ginned-up controversy after another. They all failed, and the inside story of how he handled the efforts to discredit him is a useful lesson for today.<br />Rush’s first rule was simple: “No faux apologies for fake transgressions.” The best illustration was the “phony soldiers” controversy in 2007. Rush was speaking with a caller on his program about “phony soldiers” like Jesse Macbeth, who had falsely claimed to have seen war crimes, and who was ultimately convicted for receiving veterans benefits to which he was not entitled. But Harry Reid and 40 other Senate Democrats deliberately misinterpreted his comments and sent his syndicator a letter demanding an apology, which of course wouldn’t have been accepted.<br />Rush auctioned their letter off in a show of gleeful brio, marching the document on stage handcuffed to his security guard during a Philadelphia speech. He matched the $2.1 million winning bid with his own funds, and donated the money to scholarships for the children of fallen service members and police officers. It was classic Rush: punching a hole in the arrogant, exposing their flaws, turning something fake into something larger than life, all while having “more fun than a human being should be allowed to have,” as he often said.<br />But it wasn’t all fun and games. Rush’s sponsors included thousands of small and growing businesses; they relied on his audience to pay their employees. When the industry of boycotts and business harassment came knocking at his door, threatening his sponsors with ignominy for the crime of wanting to offer their products to his audience, Rush pushed back—and hard.<br />He privately supported his sponsors and told them that the so-called boycotts would have no effect on their business unless they relented and denied themselves access to his listeners. And he was right. Internet mobs are almost always made up of small numbers of people sending huge numbers of messages. They count on sheer volume to intimidate business. Rush showed sponsors research that proved that 80% or more of all online boycott messages came from a group of people so small as to “fit in the elevator we used to come to your office for this meeting.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell underscored his determination to return the U.S. labor market to full strength, saying Wednesday the central bank won’t begin to tighten easy-money policies until it sees much more improvement.<br />The Fed will maintain ultralow interest rates and continue hefty asset purchases until “substantial further progress has been made” toward its employment and inflation goals, Mr. Powell told the House Financial Services Committee in testimony identical to his opening statement Tuesday at the Senate Banking Committee. He said those goals are “likely to take some time” to achieve.<br />He also acknowledged that the economic outlook has improved since a slowdown in late 2020. The effects have rippled across financial markets in recent days, pushing bond yields up and prices for assets that are sensitive to interest rates, such as technology stocks, down. Mr. Powell’s assurances Tuesday that Fed policy is on hold for the foreseeable future drove stocks to a partial rebound.<br />But while financial markets often reflect expectations of economic growth, inflation and corporate earnings in the future, Mr. Powell said Wednesday the Fed is looking to see “actual progress, not forecast progress” toward its employment and inflation goals before it tightens its policies.<br />He said the Fed doesn’t foresee raising its benchmark fed-funds rate from near zero until three conditions have been met: a broad range of statistics indicate that the labor market is at maximum strength, inflation has hit its 2% target and forecasters expect inflation to remain at that level or higher.</td>

      <td>David B. Rivkin Jr. and Jason Snead’s assertions in “An Unconstitutional Voting ‘Reform’” (op-ed, Feb. 17) that H.R.1, the For the People Act, is unconstitutional are inaccurate. As a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, I know the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power “at any time” to “make or alter” the regulation of the “time, place and manner” of federal elections. The broad grant of Congressional authority is contained in Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution and was recently noted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Rucho redistricting case.<br />In addition, the 14th and 15th Amendments give Congress the power to eliminate racial discrimination in voting and the democratic process, such as restricting or creating barriers to voting, partisan gerrymandering and felony disenfranchisement. Though we had record voter turnout in the 2020 elections, voters continue to be disenfranchised because of long lines, broken voting machines and polling-place closures, disproportionately affecting black, brown and indigenous communities.<br />To frame this legislation as a means to only “benefit Democrats” is also false. During my years as a Republican election lawyer, I represented Republicans who supported many of the policies that are included in the bill, including voter registration and mail-in ballot provisions. Recent polling has also shown that two-thirds of Americans across party lines support the For the People Act. This landmark legislation is not only written within the legal bounds of our Constitution, it is also an integral step toward our nation’s promise of a democracy accessible to all Americans.<br />Congress should pass this legislation, which represents the clear will of the people. Our democracy can’t wait.<br />Trevor Potter</td>

      <td>A new SRD allocation would provide liquidity to many emerging and developing countries that today have severely limited access to external financing.</td>
      <td>Your editorial “Magic Money for the Rich” (Feb. 19) on the IMF’s special drawing rights (SDRs) misses the forest for the trees. The entire world is looking to rebound post-Covid-19 from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. You should be encouraging the use of policy tools that have been proven already to help restore confidence, stability and growth—while especially benefiting those most in need. An SDR allocation helped to do just that during the global financial crisis, and SDRs can again provide such help right now.<br />No one is claiming that the SDR is perfect, but a rational judgment would begin by examining what a new allocation would actually accomplish. First, it would provide liquidity to many emerging and developing countries that today have severely limited access to external financing but have the pressing need to pay for health and economic support. The approximately $274 billion that would accrue to emerging and developing countries as their share of an SDR 500 billion increase would represent a 10% boost to their international reserves and, in some cases, double that amount.<br />Second, advanced economies—and stronger emerging economies—would be able to further support the developing world by on-lending their newly acquired SDRs on a voluntary basis. We know that this “recycling” works because the IMF already has accomplished this using existing SDRs: Poor countries could receive about $24 billion in this fashion.<br />Third, an SDR allocation itself doesn’t require budgetary resources from any country. It doesn’t add to their debt, and it creates no new obligations to any participating country.<br />Your editorial assigns great importance to the SDRs’ quota-based initial distribution that you characterize as inefficient and potentially even malign. The applicable standard, however, is a comparison with alternative tools that can be applied in a relevant scale and with the requisite speed. It is in this context that the potential value of the SDR becomes apparent. Its design ensures accountability, its past use demonstrates its effectiveness and its appropriate application would ensure fairness.</td>

      <td>All blind and visually impaired travelers using a dog guide are indebted to the Department of Transportation for its recent ruling about documenting and admitting service animals on commercial flights (“The Middle Seat: Airlines Tighten Leash on Pets in the Cabin,” Personal Journal, Feb. 18).<br />I am blind and a frequent flier of  American Airlines  with help from my service dog, Eva. In the past, my travel experiences have been disturbed by passengers accompanied by untrained emotional-support animals that may make them feel comfortable, but disturb fellow passengers.<br />No longer will I be asked to move to make room for a fake service dog. No longer will my guide dog, who lies quietly at my feet throughout an entire flight, be disturbed by an emotional-support dog barking at her. No longer will dogs be urinating and defecating in airline terminals, which create a bad impression of actual service dogs that are trained not to relieve themselves in public places.<br />Anyone who owns a pet can understand a deep attachment to a beloved animal, but some of us need service animals to navigate busy departure terminals, the narrow confines of airplanes and our eventual destinations. The visually impaired travel with our guide dogs out of necessity, and the DOT and airlines were justified and entirely correct in setting new guidelines for identification and registration of service dogs.<br />Virginia Jacko</td>

      <td>The novelist known for ‘Strangers on a Train’ and ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’ inspired a new kind of movie villain in the 1950s who still stalks us today, in the centenary year of her birth.</td>
      <td><br /><br />The next time you watch a movie or TV series about a heartless serial killer, say a silent word of thanks to the novelist who made such plots possible. It was Patricia Highsmith, born a century ago last month, who flung open the doors of Hollywood and invited the crazies in.<br />Highsmith specialized in jolting tales of mentally disordered men and women who mirrored her own profound strangeness and motiveless malignity (she was a racist and anti-Semite). “If she hadn’t had her work, she would have been sent to an insane asylum or an alcoholics’ home,” a friend claimed. She made her debut as a novelist in 1950 with “Strangers on a Train,” the story of a charming psychopath named Bruno who offers a deal to a man whom he meets by chance on a train: He will kill the man’s promiscuous wife in return for having the father he despises murdered, assuming that no one will connect the two killings and both men will get away scot-free. Bruno fulfills his end of the deal, but Guy, the other man, never took the pact seriously and refuses to cooperate, sending Bruno into a downward spiral of lunatic frenzy. When Alfred Hitchcock filmed “Strangers” in 1951, he cast Robert Walker, heretofore a boy-next-door type, as Bruno, and Walker gave a performance whose flamboyant panache is at once perversely appealing and truly terrifying.<br />It was unusual to encounter such villains in Hollywood films of the ’30s and ’40s. The Motion Picture Production Code forbade the portrayal of villains who were sympathetic, much less charming or charismatic. Moreover, the “bad guys” in gangster movies, westerns and adventure films of the period were normally motivated by greed or revenge, not the mere desire to shed blood and sow chaos. And while some sympathetic villains, like Humphrey Bogart’s aging heister in Raoul Walsh’s “High Sierra” (1941), made it onto the screen, they, like the usual bad guys, got it in the end.</td>

Here, they each recommend one of their favorite nominated titles. Below, edited excerpts:<br /><br />( Netflix )<br />Mr. Rhys is nominated for his performance of the title role in HBO’s “Perry Mason.” He recommends the Netflix’s series ‘Ozark,’ about a couple that launders money for a drug cartel, now three seasons deep. “Ozark” is nominated for multiple awards, including best performance by an actor in a drama series for Jason Bateman.<br />“What I always harken to about a show is: What’s the initial hook? After the first episode of ‘Ozark’ you go: oh, s—, how is that gonna resolve? And then you’re in. When the premise is that strong, you’ve got the golden ticket. And no one does everyman in peril better than Jason Bateman. You want to see how he’s going to deal with certain situations. And in a way, it’s kind of masochistic, to watch something where you’re so anxiety-ridden. He also has that rare thing where he can convey [it] comedically in a moment when it shouldn’t be present. Whether it’s through gestures or osmosis, he can kind of make you laugh in the most heightened situations.”</td>

The tie-up would create one of the world’s largest contract-research organizations, known as CROs, which test experimental drugs in animals and help run studies of promising late-stage drugs in humans.<br />In acquiring PRA, Icon would expand into digital and technology capabilities that are playing roles in clinical trials accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, such as virtual monitoring of study subjects as people stay at home and avoid public places. Raleigh, N.C.-based PRA’s products include mobile and digital platforms that enable trial subjects to enter medical information on their smartphones, easing the burden of data collection on study managers.<br />“I think the pandemic has shown everybody that we can do things differently and it works,” Icon Chief Executive Steve Cutler said Wednesday.  Dr. Cutler said Icon has about 1,000 employees working on Covid-19 vaccine research for  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE .<br />PRA has been helping drugmakers recruit subjects for trials evaluating Covid-19 drugs and vaccines and helping make Covid-19 testing more available.

      <td>Oenophilia is often undertaken with the utmost reverence. So our wine columnist went looking for levity—and bottles that bring joy in more ways than one</td>
      <td>I’VE BEEN THINKING about Ralph Steadman recently. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the English illustrator lent his whimsical style to wine books as well as the catalog for the Oddbins wine, beer and spirits retail chain in the U.K. Think tipsy, red-nosed drinkers and mice dipping into glasses of Sherry. The world of wine according to Mr. Steadman was highly irreverent, slightly diabolical and a great deal of fun.<br />The real wine world, by contrast, hasn’t been so much fun lately. Winemakers whose sales are down—their tasting rooms closed, in many cases, by government order—tend to be more earnest than amusing. Retailers, meanwhile, are more likely to sell wines with the aid of point scores than mouse cartoons. But because I believe that even the most serious oenophile appreciates, and perhaps needs, a laugh or two, I went looking for present-day wine fun. Happily, I found some good stuff.<br />“No one calls me unless they want to talk about something funny on our wine label,” said John Williams, founder of Frog’s Leap Winery in Napa Valley, when I called him the other week. I told him this was one of those calls. I’d bought a bottle of his wine recently and found a note on the back label instructing the buyer: “Open At Other End.”<br />Frog’s Leap has been funny for decades, ever since its first wine, a Sauvignon Blanc, debuted in 1981. The winery’s motto, “Time’s fun when you’re having flies,” made it clear that no one at Frog’s Leap, least of all Mr. Williams, takes him- or herself too seriously. For example, a timeline entry on the winery’s website notes, “John befriends Jonah Beer, Director of Sales at Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars while on the road and teaches him how to cheat on his expense account.” (The bit about the expense account is crossed out.)<br />Mr. Williams did note that humor can have its drawbacks. “When you inject any kind of playfulness into your messaging, to some people that might suggest that your wine isn’t good,” he said. I assured him I take him seriously, and the savory 2019 Frog’s Leap Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($19) I bought was quite good.</td>

Tipton of the Southern District of Texas, in a decision issued late Tuesday night, said the administration hadn’t offered a reasonable explanation for an across-the-board pause that left little room for considering deportations on a case-by-case basis.<br />The Biden administration on Jan. 20, its first day, announced the 100-day deportation moratorium, and the Department of Homeland Security began enforcing the pause on Jan. 22.<br />Judge Tipton said the new administration was entitled to leeway to formulate its enforcement priorities and review the Trump administration’s immigration policies, “but a need to assess priorities does not necessarily mean a pause on government functions.”<br />The judge, a Trump appointee, issued a temporary restraining order last month that initially blocked the policy, but those orders are short in duration. In the latest move, he issued a preliminary injunction against the pause, which will block it indefinitely.</td>

It’s going to be more gradual.”<br />Mr. Bernstein defended the president’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan against critics who say it risks overheating the economy and generating inflation. He acknowledged that rising inflation is a potential risk, but that a weak recovery that leads to scarring for households and businesses—such as long-term unemployment, foreclosures and bankruptcies—would do more harm.<br />“There is room for more heat,” he said, pointing to data on weekly claims for unemployment benefits, which came to 861,000 in the most recent report, and elevated jobless rates in minority communities as evidence of spare capacity in the economy.<br />Mr. Bernstein pointed to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said Tuesday that he doesn’t expect a temporary burst of federal spending to cause a large or persistent rise in inflation.</td>

But his tenure has been marked by several controversies, including this month’s $573 million settlement with states over McKinsey’s work advising OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and other drug manufacturers to aggressively market opioid painkillers<br />Mr. Sneader’s letter to employees about the opioid settlement was noticeably blunt in criticizing the firm’s behavior. He said the firm fell short of its standards and “did not adequately acknowledge the epidemic unfolding in our communities or the terrible impact of opioid misuse and addiction, and for that I am deeply sorry.”<br />Some partners felt that language was too strong and its advice to clients was legal and given in good faith, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

      <td>Volvo Car Corp. and  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd.  said Wednesday that they would combine their engine and transmissions business but backed away from a full-blown merger of the Chinese and Swedish companies that are owned by Chinese billionaire Li Shufu.<br />The move highlights a trend, increasingly favored by investors, for companies to sharpen their focus rather than become entangled in larger conglomerates that often dilute the value of their constituent businesses.<br />The agreement leaves the two auto makers as stand-alone entities under the umbrella of Mr. Li’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. It allows Geely Auto to move forward with plans to raise the equivalent of nearly $3 billion through a share listing on Shanghai’s STAR Market for growth stocks. The decision also renews speculation that Volvo could seek an independent stock-market listing.<br />The two companies said last year that they were holding talks that could lead to combining their businesses. In the end, they said they feared that a merger would present integration issues and distract them during a period of industrywide transformation in the shift to electric vehicles.<br />“A full merger would be too much internal focus and organizational disputes and power plays,” Volvo Chief Executive Officer Håkan Samuelsson said in an interview. “I think that’s number one, to really maintain full focus on growth, especially since we have been growing a lot on the Geely and the Volvo side and don’t want to jeopardize anything there.”</td>

It was the second time it has issued bonds in euros.<br />One of the most oil-dependent countries in the world, Saudi Arabia has regularly tapped international bond markets since 2016 to balance its budget amid crude price swings. Its economy contracted 3.9% last year as the coronavirus pandemic hit global energy demand, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund, leaving it with a budget deficit of 12% of economic output by December.<br />The government has put forward a plan to more than halve this shortfall by cutting spending this year. Its decision to issue in euros is likely part of this, analysts said.<br />The eurozone has had a negative policy rate since 2014, which acts as a reference for sovereign and corporate debt, bringing down the cost of borrowing in euros overall. Governments and companies around the world often tap Europe’s bond market to access cheaper funds. China was able to borrow at negative rates for the first time last year in a three-part euro-denominated debt sale.</td>

      <td>THERE WOULD be salad. This much Brandon Jew knew when he opened his restaurant Mister Jiu’s, back in 2016. “We have so much great produce here in the Bay Area,” he said. “It’s built into how we eat in San Francisco. And it’s built into my training as a chef.”<br />His first cookbook, “Mister Jiu’s in Chinatown: Recipes and Stories from the Birthplace of Chinese American Food,” co-authored with Tienlon Ho, comes out March 9. This recipe is a pared-down version of one included in the salad chapter. Mr. Jew calls for scattering sweet mandarin segments across a platter and topping them with shaved fennel, tarragon and salty Marcona almonds. The dressing is a revelation, a mix of olive oil, vinegar, toasted anise seeds and a surprising creamy element: almond milk. “It works like buttermilk,” Mr. Jew said. At the restaurant he uses a house-made “milk” made from apricot kernels, but a good store-bought almond milk works just fine here.<br />Though a salad like this one might not immediately register as the sort of Chinese American classic Mr. Jew features on his menu, this recipe still speaks to his memories of eating at Chinese restaurants as a child. “For dessert it was almond Jell-O with fruit cocktail,” he said. “These flavors remind me of that.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

But both production and power generation from gas dropped by about a third last week during an unusually strong winter storm that caused demand for power and heat to surge.<br />Freezing water and blackouts wreaked havoc on everything from wells in the prolific Permian Basin to pipelines and regional storage facilities that feed power plants across the state. The resulting gas shortage sent prices soaring and disadvantaged power plants that purchase daily fuel supplies on the spot market.<br />The state’s gas infrastructure and power generation failed for similar reasons: Neither is designed to perform in subfreezing weather, unlike similar equipment in parts of the U.S. where colder temperatures are more common.<br />Engineers said Texas gas production was slowed by low temperatures that froze water produced alongside oil and gas and entered oil-field tanks. Compressors that help move oil and gas through pipelines also became inoperable because of the cold weather.</td>

Home Depot declined to give guidance.<br />So far, there are no signs of sales slowing down.

      <td>A brief history of the accessibly priced Nuptse—a nostalgic icon adored by celebs like Bella Hadid—and three equally toasty modern-day options</td>
      <td>IN 1992, the North Face introduced its “Nuptse” down jacket, destined to become an icon of puffiness. It came in primary colors, with a conspicuous band of black spanning the shoulders and the curvy, highly recognizable white North Face logo prominently displayed. Those born in the 1980s or early ’90s will likely recall this jacket from their high-school days. Others might remember seeing teens in these fire-truck-red and bright-yellow puffers around town, or even on the cover of New York magazine’s 1996 “Prep-School Gangsters” issue, which featured a fleet of Nuptse’d-out youths. That’s how central this coat was to pre-Y2K fashion.<br />But the Nuptse jacket is no mere memory. Reissued in 2018, the retro puffer has proven so popular lately that certain sizes and colors are perpetually sold out on the North Face website. One indication of its must-have status: On the Lyst Index, a ranking compiled by Lyst, a British company that tracks the behavior of more than 9 million online shoppers a month, the Nuptse jacket was the top item during the fourth quarter of 2020—for both men and women. Peter Henderson, who manages the Index, noted that this was the first time that’s happened.<br />Some of the Nupste’s current popularity can be attributed to its celebrity fans—particularly female ones. After stars including models like Emily Ratajkowski and Bella Hadid wore the Nuptse in recent months, it’s ricocheted across Instagram accounts and media that tracks celebrity style.<br />But the coat has also surged for more practical reasons. Mr. Henderson noted that with many people forced to socialize outside during the pandemic, even in frigid conditions, demand for mammoth, goose-down-filled coats like the Nuptse has risen. The price is also right: At $280 the Nuptse—when you can find it in stock—is comparatively affordable as down outerwear goes. And being budget-conscious is also on trend during this uncertain pandemic period. (That said, the North Face has released some pretty high-end puffers recently, including a nearly $3,000 collaboration with Gucci.)<br />The other hook of the Nuptse is nostalgia. Along with mock-neck T-shirts, washed jeans and flannel shirts, the Nuptse is a ’90s fashion icon that, for many, provides the comfort of familiarity. “People are after the things that make them think of different periods in time rather than that difficult moment that we find ourselves in,” said Mr. Henderson.</td>

      <td>Federal judge’s decision allows largest state’s law protecting open internet principles to go into effect</td>
      <td>A federal judge rejected a telecommunications-industry challenge to California’s two-year-old net neutrality law, clearing the way for the state to begin enforcing the consumer protections.<br />The law’s supporters argued that stronger protections for net neutrality—the principle that cable and wireless companies should treat all online content under consistent standards—will protect the internet’s open nature and prevent telecom companies from picking winners and losers on the web. Internet-service providers said the rules are unnecessary and interfere with reasonable business practices.<br />The Tuesday decision from U.S. District Court Judge John Mendez denied an injunction sought by trade groups representing the country’s largest cable and wireless companies. The ruling means officials could start enforcing the rules within weeks absent other legal challenges.<br />California legislators passed the law in 2018. The state protections followed the spirit of federal rules written during the Obama administration, by barring internet service providers from blocking access to lawful websites or slowing down connections to certain web domains. The law also banned “zero rating,” an industry practice of providing some data free of charge while billing for online traffic from other sources.<br />A coalition of telephone and cable companies immediately opposed the rule and the Trump administration’s Justice Department sued to block it. The administration argued that new rules passed by a Republican-led Federal Communications Commission not only repealed federal net-neutrality protections but also pre-empted the kind of regulations California had sought on a state level.</td>

      <td>To grow into its valuation, company will need to convert users’ digital-currency dalliance into long-term relationships</td>
      <td>Square  needs bitcoin to be the gateway to digital banking.<br />Chief Executive Jack Dorsey on Tuesday said bitcoin will be the “native currency” of the internet, and Square said it bought an additional $170 million worth of the digital currency in the fourth quarter—certainly more grist for those who believe bitcoin’s price tumble this week is just a hiccup. Bitcoin now makes up about 5% of the company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.<br />This may perhaps import a bit of bitcoin’s volatility into the company’s share price, which dipped 6% on Wednesday morning. Though any discount to its multiple would hardly make a dent: Square is trading at over 190 times forward earnings.<br />Still, it emphasizes the point that Square may need some pandemic-era trends, including the enthusiasm for bitcoin, to last into the future to reach the goals investors are betting on.<br />Take the original business of Square, providing payments and other services to small and medium-size sellers. Many of those merchants have adapted to incredibly tough conditions by adding websites, new revenue streams and virtual payments, and Square has upped spending on sales and marketing to help drive that transition. Square’s seller gross payment volume from online jumped 50% in 2020, even as its seller payment volume overall was flat for the year.</td>

      <td>Yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury bond hits pre-pandemic level</td>
      <td>A settlement between creditors in Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy case is lifting prices of the commonwealth’s municipal bonds and shares of insurance companies that guaranteed payments on the bonds.<br />Traders drove up prices of the island’s benchmark $3.5 billion general obligation bond due 2035 by 3.3% to around 78 cents on the dollar after the Tuesday deal removed one of the last logjams in Puerto Rico’s nearly four-year journey through bankruptcy court. Roughly $275 million face amount of the bond changed hands Tuesday and about $30 million traded early Wednesday morning, making it one of the most actively traded securities in the municipal-bond market, according to data from Electronic Municipal Market Access.<br />Shares of the insurers that guaranteed payments on billions of dollars of Puerto Rico’s defaulted bonds also rose as the settlement removed some uncertainty about the amount of claims they would need to pay.  MBIA Inc.’s  stock has jumped around 15% this week, while  Ambac Financial Group Inc.’s  shares have gained about 7.2%.<br />The disparate hedge funds and mutual funds that own Puerto Rico’s debts have agreed to several previous restructurings of the payments they are owed only to be forced to recut those deals as natural disasters and the Covid-19 pandemic hammered the island’s economy. Holders of about $11.7 billion support the new proposal in a major step to resolving the $35 billion of claims against Puerto Rico, according to an announcement by the oversight board managing the island’s financial overhaul.<br />The most recent iteration stands out because for the first time it includes “conditional support” from insurers who guaranteed bond payments, analysts at CreditSights said in a report. “Their support together with the supporting uninsured creditors means there may be enough support for the [plan] to exceed the requisite acceptance thresholds,” they said.</td>

The San Mateo, Calif.-based videogame provider plans to hold a direct listing for its shares on or around March 10 on the New York Stock Exchange, bypassing the traditional route of an initial public offering.<br />Roblox isn’t a traditional videogame company and is using a nontraditional process to potentially reach investors as the pandemic has driven people to spend more time and money on gameplay. Here’s what you need to know about the company and its plans for a direct listing.<br />Roblox is a free online platform that features tens of millions of multiplayer games made by its own players with tools the company provides. The games range from obstacle-course challenges and iterations of capture the flag to contests based on popular characters such as Peppa Pig and Sonic the Hedgehog. Company officials have said they are interested in increasing the use of Roblox for things such as virtual concerts and meetings.<br />Roblox is accessible on computers, consoles and mobile devices. The company said it had roughly 33 million daily users last year, of whom more than half are under the age of 13. Players in Roblox appear in the form of customizable avatars.<br />Programmers David Baszucki and Erik Cassel started Roblox in 2004. Mr. Cassel died from cancer in 2013, and Mr. Baszucki serves as chief executive, president and board chairman. Mr. Baszucki remains the company’s largest shareholder and holds more than 70% of the voting rights.</td>

In my mind I saw a charming Delft-blue-and-white kitchen with bracketed wall shelves displaying glass jars full of the vegetables I would farm on the arable part of my one-eighth acre lot.<br />What we ended up with looked more like the interior of a junked subway car. The “white” paint I picked gave the walls an aortic, bluish tinge when paired with the gray linoleum floor. Flimsy plywood shelves bowed. A Smurf-blue window blind above the sink failed to pull the whole look together.<br />Over the years, I have come to understand that one of the biggest problems amateur home designers face is not imagination but vocabulary.

Mine is this 1,160-page tome, which describes interior elements and gives rules for designing them. Thousands of illustrations help the reader identify architectural features such as molding (crown, deep-script, chair rail, picture rail) and windows (hopper, awning, vertical pivot, eyebrow with Gothic divided lites).

      <td>Even if the recent clamor for cleaning products abates, Reckitt Benckiser’s long-term prospects have improved since the onset of the pandemic</td>
      <td>The British company behind Lysol and other disinfectant brands was a clear pandemic winner. Investors have little confidence that last year’s sales boom will stick, which seems overly pessimistic.<br />Reckitt Benckiser ,  which also owns health-oriented brands such as Durex condoms and Mucinex cold remedies, said Wednesday that sales increased by an unprecedented 11.8% last year compared with 2019, stripping out the impact of portfolio changes and exchange rate moves. Operating margins fell while the company invested heavily in research and development, improved its supply chain and expanded into new markets—bringing its disinfectant brands to Brazil and Turkey, for example.<br />Shareholders seem to think the best is over. The company’s guidance that sales will grow by just 0% to 2% in 2021 hasn’t helped. Reckitt’s share price is back at pre-Covid levels, having fallen roughly 25% from its pandemic peak last summer. As a multiple of next year’s earnings, the stock trades at 18.7 times. That is cheap for a consumer staples company—though peers such as  Unilever  have also underperformed in recent weeks as investors become more focused on economic recovery.<br />Even if demand for cleaning products ebbs, a portfolio shake-up is under way to root out losing brands. Reckitt has put its Chinese infant nutrition business under review. It is an admission that the previous management team’s $17 billion purchase of Mead Johnson in 2017—an expensive bet on the Chinese baby food market—has soured.<br />Reckitt isn’t the only foreign baby-food manufacturer struggling in China. Local competitor Feihe is taking market share from  Nestlé  and  Danone  too, and China’s birthrate plummeted by 15% last year, according to official statistics. Reckitt also said Wednesday that it has sold its Scholl footcare brand for an undisclosed amount. Together, these two weak businesses contributed around 8% of Reckitt’s sales.</td>

      <td>An actress in her 20s alleges the 72-year-old raped and sexually assaulted her on two occasions in 2018, according to a judicial official</td>
      <td>PARIS—A French investigative judge has brought preliminary charges of rape and sexual assault against Gérard Depardieu, an actor once regarded as the face of French cinema.<br />The judge filed the charges in December, alleging Mr. Depardieu raped an actress in the summer of 2018, a French judicial official said Wednesday. The actress, a woman in her 20s, hasn’t been identified.<br />Under the French legal system, the filing of preliminary charges indicates that the investigating judge believes there is enough evidence against Mr. Depardieu for authorities to deepen their investigation of the accusations. The judge could then decide to drop the charges or order him to stand trial.<br />“Mr. Depardieu is and remains presumed innocent,” said the actor’s lawyer Hervé Temime. “He strongly contests the accusations against him.”<br />The actress brought a complaint against Mr. Depardieu, 72-years-old, in August 2018, saying he sexually assaulted and raped her on two occasions earlier that month at his house in the upscale 6th arrondissement of Paris.</td>

Still, the report’s release comes as the DTCC faces an unusual degree of attention because of its role in the GameStop frenzy.<br />Last week, lawmakers from the House Financial Services Committee grilled Robinhood Chief ExecutiveVlad Tenev over his firm’s controversial decision to restrict trading in GameStop on Jan. 28. The trading limits came at the peak of the stock’s rally, infuriating many Robinhood customers, and they punctured the huge speculative run-up in GameStop.<br />Mr. Tenev said Robinhood’s hand was forced by the DTCC’s huge margin call, and he called for a shake-up of the clearinghouse’s processes to reduce the burdens that they place on brokers.</td>

      <td>Several states and countries require visitors to show a negative Covid-19 test or face a quarantine. Do-it-yourself kits are the easiest solution, but just make sure you’re using the right kind.</td>
      <td>SPRING IS ALMOST here, and if your escape fantasies run to more than a short drive to Aunt Susie’s in the Poconos, odds are you’ll be booking a Covid-19 test along with your air tickets. Many destinations—Hawaii, Maine, most of the Caribbean and even Aspen, Colo.—will let you avoid a quarantine if you’ve recently tested negative for the virus. But you might need to submit to multiple tests during your getaway. A post-arrival screen is required in some places, including Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jordan and Rwanda. If you’re abroad, the U.S. State Department specifies that everyone returning to the U.S. show proof of a negative Covid-19 test. Although more people are getting inoculated against the virus, a vaccine alone won’t ensure access to most destinations, including the U.S.<br />One way to avoid endless clinic visits? Self-administered Covid tests you can take at home or in your hotel. Last year the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began greenlighting DIY tests under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), while other options come with a seal of approval from airlines: Delta, for example, has teamed with Azova (azovahealth.com/test/delta), which offers home saliva tests for travelers for $119 or $115 at some  Costco  locations. Both require a video observation call during the actual test, insisted upon by some destinations. You can even double up on kits, packing one in your bag in case you need a second one.<br />Hawaii has also begun a pilot program with biometrics company Clear, whose Health Pass app lets travelers access at-home tests, as well as in-person test locations, from a list of approved providers. The app also allows users to whisk results directly to the airline on which they’re flying to the Aloha state.<br />Other home test services include LabCorp’s Pixel and Vault, to which the  JetBlue  website refers fliers. Customers sign up online to get the test kit and a return envelope to send the sample—nasal swab or saliva, depending on the type you order—back to the lab. Results are usually posted within 48 to 72 hours after you’ve taken the test.<br />Take care that your test meets the requirements at your destination; many request a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) lab test, although the more rapid antigen version is now more widely accepted. An even faster way to dispense with testing might soon be available: The FDA has recently approved new tests that will deliver results at home in 30 minutes—eliminating the agonizing wait for a timely result. As of now, however, it’s unclear when—or if—they’ll be accepted by travel destinations.</td>

      <td>Lucid Motors has a better claim than most to be the next Tesla, but Reddit-reading investors in the company taking it public are looking too far into an uncertain future</td>
      <td>Is electric-vehicle company Lucid Motors worth $11.75 billion, $24 billion or $57 billion? The one thing investors can be sure of is that the lower the valuation they buy at, the better their chances of making returns.<br />Lucid, one of the most promising startups trying to follow Tesla’s lead in EVs, announced a merger late Monday with Churchill Capital IV or CCIV, a special-purpose acquisition company founded by Michael Klein. Bloomberg reported talks last month, and since then the market value of CCIV, which consists of $2.1 billion in cash, has ballooned to $9.1 billion amid much discussion on Reddit. As the deal allocated CCIV shareholders 16.1% of Lucid’s equity, the implied market value of the combined companies is now roughly $57 billion—even excluding the impact of shares and warrants held by Michael Klein and his team that are due to vest.<br />That valuation, which compares to about $45 billion for  Ford Motor ,  was even higher before the transaction was officially announced: CCIV shares plunged 39% Tuesday. It was a rough day for Tesla’s stock too, particularly in the morning, as investors weighed the prospect of rising interest rates and a consequent “rotation” away from expensive tech shares. Yet the terms of the transaction—notably some valuation numbers backed by hardheaded negotiations—may also have helped sober CCIV investors up.<br />CCIV agreed to pay $11.75 billion for Lucid’s existing business. Add the blank-check company’s $2.1 billion in cash and another $2.5 billion in cash from institutional investors and you get postdeal equity of $16.3 billion. But the company also cited a valuation of $24 billion. This is because the institutional investors agreed to buy into CCIV at $15 a share—a 50% premium to its net asset value but far below its current share price. Apply that premium to the entire equity and you get roughly $24 billion.<br />What all these numbers spell out is that different investors are buying Lucid at different prices. Those who invested in CCIV at the outset are paying the least. Institutions such as Fidelity and  BlackRock  that are getting shares through the secondary fundraising are paying more. And anyone who buys CCIV stock now is paying by far the most, even after Tuesday’s correction.</td>

But reconciliation also comes with Senate rules on what proposals can be approved under the special procedure—including that the provision be directly tied to the budget. The nonpartisan parliamentarian will hear arguments from both parties and is expected to make a ruling on Wednesday or Thursday on the question.<br />A favorable ruling from the parliamentarian on raising the minimum wage through reconciliation will open the door for lawmakers to increase the federal minimum wage for the first time since 2009. But then Democrats will have to agree on exactly how to do so.<br />“It will be a whole caucus discussion because you still have to have 50 votes,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), a proponent of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, said.</td>

When I finally looked up in the Echo Show’s direction, it had turned to meet my gaze. As I walked back over, the screen panned again. In the morning light, I could see the device’s pea-size, motion-detecting camera challenging me to a staring contest I’d never win.<br />After experiencing the auto-tracking technology for the first time, I felt a mix of awe and dread. Not only can  Amazon ’s  devices see and hear us—now, they can follow us, too. It doesn’t have wheels. It’s more like a dog who watches you get kibble from the pantry as he sits like a good boy.<br />The Echo Show 10, which begins shipping Thursday, has a 10.1-inch screen connected by a robot arm. At $250, it’s also the company’s most expensive Echo.<br />Like other Alexa devices, this one can set timers and control your smart lightbulbs. And as a speaker, it sounds great. But the main idea is that its screen is visible whenever you look up, displaying your  Netflix  show or the next step in a recipe. And if you’re multitasking on a video call, the camera and robot arm will keep you in frame.<br />At first, the autonomously moving screen was more creepy than cool. After a few days, that unnerving feeling dissipated. At some point, the robo-screen actually started to make sense.</td>

At the time, the firm was attracted to what it saw as a relatively low level of technology adoption among water utilities compared with other industries such as healthcare or finance, according to partner Arvindh Kumar, who joined EQT in early 2020 to lead the firm’s U.S. investments in technology, media and telecommunications.<br />“We thought that over a longer period of time it [would be] a very attractive market where there would be growth and adoption of technology solutions to help utilities,” Mr. Kumar said.</td>

A measure of mortgage applications fell 11.4% over the same week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.<br />Improving Covid-19 vaccination rates in the U.S. and expectations of a large federal stimulus package in the coming weeks drove benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields, which are closely tied to mortgage rates, to their largest weekly gains in more than a month last week. Demand in safe-haven assets such as government bonds weakens when investors feel optimistic about the economy.<br />“Higher rates are a signal of expectations of faster growth and a stronger job market ahead,” said Mike Fratantoni, the MBA’s chief economist. “This last week, rates have turned faster than many people had anticipated.”<br />Rising rates sometimes prompt borrowers to put their mortgage plans on hold for a few weeks, Mr. Fratantoni said.

Her decision is expected Wednesday or Thursday, according to lawmakers and aides.<br />Reconciliation is designed to help lawmakers pass legislation tied to the budget quickly with just 51 votes, rather than the 60 required for most bills to advance. That means Democrats will be able to pass the bill without any GOP votes, so long as they don’t lose any Democrats.<br />To qualify for the special fast-track procedures, measures have to be directly tied to the budget. Specifically, they have to have a meaningful fiscal impact that can’t be “merely incidental” to the policy proposal. If not, the provision can be challenged under the “Byrd rule,” named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.).<br />The Byrd rule also prevents any provision of the bill from adding to the deficit beyond the bill’s budgetary window, unless lawmakers find a way to offset its cost through the committee that has jurisdiction over that provision.</td>

That was the acquisition of  Slack Technologies —a messaging and collaboration platform for businesses that is popular but has yet to turn a profit. At $27.7 billion, Slack was nearly twice the size of Salesforce’s second-largest deal, which was the acquisition of Tableau Software in mid-2019. The deal also capped a run in which Salesforce acquired 28 companies in a five-year span, with reported values totaling $54.3 billion, according to FactSet.<br />Slack, in other words, was just the latest in a long string of deals that have grown more expensive over the years. But investors have taken a particularly dim view of the transaction. Salesforce shares have shed nearly 10% of their value since The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks between the two companies on Nov. 25. That contrasts with a 6% gain for the S&P 500 Software & Services Group and a 17% rise by the BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index over the same period. The price tag represented about 26 times Slack’s projected revenue for the next 12 months—more than twice the multiple paid for Tableau—and Salesforce didn’t even face competition on the deal, according to regulatory filings detailing the background of the merger.<br />That provides a challenging setup coming into Salesforce’s fiscal fourth-quarter results, scheduled for Thursday afternoon. The quarter is typically a strong period for the business, historically representing at least 45% of the company’s billings for the full fiscal year. But investors have been concerned about the rationale for the Slack deal, and the impact it will have on Salesforce’s margins. Slack is projected to show about $47 million in operating losses for the fiscal year ended January. An investor survey by Bernstein Research in December showed 84% of respondents believed the deal to be “value destructive” for Salesforce investors.<br />Salesforce already included Slack in its initial projection of 21% revenue growth for the fiscal year ending next January, so the potential for further upside from top-line growth guidance may be limited.</td>

      <td>Rising long-term Treasury yields ultimately might not pose much of a problem for most stocks. But the bout of indigestion that higher yields are already giving to some of the past year’s biggest winners—shares of companies including  Amazon.com ,   Apple ,   Tesla  and  Microsoft —could prove more lasting.<br />Some of that is because these companies’ steep valuations make them vulnerable to rising yields. But it also stems from how, even as the Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc, those stocks did so well.<br />With the daily tally of new Covid-19 cases falling rapidly, millions of vaccine doses going into arms each week and another round of government support looking as if it is on its way, a return to something like normal in the months ahead is looking more and more likely. And with that prospect of recovery, bond investors have become less enamored with the safety of long-term Treasurys, pushing rates higher. The 10-year note’s yield is now 1.36%, compared with 0.88% just three months ago, marking its highest level in a year.<br />For most U.S. companies, the all-clear signal that the Treasury market has started sounding is a good thing. As Americans get back to doing things like eating out at restaurants, heading out on vacations and going to the mall, sales could flourish. Considering how much money has built up in a lot of people’s bank accounts during the pandemic and how much pent-up demand there is for all the things they did before the pandemic, there could be a bit of a boom.<br />For the shares of those companies, on the other hand, the rise in long-term rates provides a bit of a challenge: The higher that yields go, the more competitive bonds are with stocks. The challenge is hardly insurmountable, however, considering that the better economy that yields are heralding makes for better profits. That is why as often as not in recent years, periods of rising Treasury yields coincide with stocks rising, too.</td>
