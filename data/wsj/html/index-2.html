      <td>For a few weeks last June and July, Seyi Fabode’s phone rang off the hook.<br />“I was constantly roped into calls with 20 other white founders as the ‘Black founder’ to talk about my experience,” says Mr. Fabode, an entrepreneur in Austin, Texas, and co-founder of Varuna, which provides software and sensors for water utilities. He was happy to recommend talented Black job candidates when asked.<br />“But as I followed up with those same people months later, asking, ‘Did you make that hire?,’ in almost every single instance, they say, ‘Oh, it’s been so busy…’ Meaning, in a word, no.”<br />Offices across the country responded to this summer’s racial-justice protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day with an unprecedented wave of diversity and antiracism training. Half a year later, workers of color are taking stock of the results.<br />It’s a mixed bag. It’s clear by now that corporate diversity efforts require substantial follow-up, both in terms of interpersonal dynamics and in translating rhetoric into concrete policies. Not all workplaces are up to the challenge.</td>

      <td>Another spending blowout, but at least it has limits on the Fed.</td>
      <td>Congress is close to agreement on another trillion-dollar Covid-19 relief bill, but please don’t call this economic stimulus. With some exceptions, the main relief here is for the politicians who want to take credit for doling out more cash to constituents.<br />The best provision in the bill is the limit on potential abuse by the Biden Treasury and Federal Reserve. Credit here to Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who held firm on limiting the Fed’s maneuvering room without a new act of Congress. Democrats are claiming victory, but that’s face-saving spin.<br />The bill will repurpose the $429 billion in Cares Act emergency funding that the Fed hasn’t had to use. It also includes language barring the Fed from restarting the facilities that are set to expire on Dec. 31 or creating clones. That’s important because the wailing over this language proves that Democrats want to use the Fed to bail out state and local governments. They said so in the House Heroes Act by demanding 10-year, 25-basis-point Fed loans.<br />Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his media echoes targeted Mr. Toomey as their villain du jour, as if financial markets are still in a crisis. They also claimed Mr. Toomey wanted to rewrite the law governing 13(3) Fed facilities, but that is false. His aim is to make sure that emergency facilities don’t become open-ended fiscal programs. Bigger companies now have ample access to private credit, and small businesses are getting more direct aid.<br />Readers may recall that last March Democrats were calling the money for Fed pandemic facilities a “slush fund” for Donald Trump. “Trump wants our response to be a half-trillion dollar slush fund to boost favored companies and corporate executives,” Elizabeth Warren tweeted. Joe Biden slammed the Fed programs as a “$500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions.” The Trump Treasury used the money responsibly.</td>

Instead he’s calling Members of Congress and asking them to object on the House and Senate floor to the results of the Electoral College count.<br />This won’t change the outcome, but it will put pressure on Republicans to embarrass themselves by indulging Mr. Trump’s attempts to delegitimize the results. We hope the Members ignore his pleas.<br />Meanwhile, after days of silence over the hack on U.S. government agencies and private companies, Mr. Trump chimed in Saturday to add confusion. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that the evidence clearly points to the Russians for the hack.<br />But Mr. Trump tweeted that “Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream [media] is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of . . . discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).” Then he linked the hack to a possible “hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA.”</td>

      <td>Rhode Island allows more charter schools after union failures.</td>
      <td>A report last year found abject student performance, demoralized teachers and deteriorating buildings in Providence, Rhode Island’s traditional public schools. Well, this particular hell may have frozen over, as last week the state’s education council voted to expand and open more charter schools to rescue students in the district.<br />About 13% of Providence’s 30,000 students attend 28 charter schools, some in other districts. But demand far exceeds supply. Only 18% of the 5,000 or so charter school applicants were offered a seat this school year, according to the state education department. Eighty-four percent of Providence students are low-income and 92% are minorities.<br />The state education council last week gave preliminary approval for more than 5,700 new charter seats in Providence and other districts. Three of four new charters that applied got a green-light to open, pending final approval in the spring, and three existing charters (two of which serve Providence) are expanding. “Parents of color don’t have a lot of choice and resources,” said Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green, who pushed the expansion. “We should not be closing opportunities.”<br />The teachers union isn’t happy. In a letter to Gov. Gina Raimondo, three union leaders including American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten complained that the expansion would “financially destabilize the Providence school district, because it would drain money from neighborhood public schools.”<br />This is the usual rhetorical union trick. Charters are public schools, albeit without the barnacles and costs of union control. Funding for charter schools in Rhode Island follows the student, though local districts retain a portion for fixed costs when students leave for a charter. The state took over the Providence school district, including the budget, last year after the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy exposed the school horror show in a study.</td>

      <td>Strapped hospitals are struggling to set up infusion sites. But states and the feds can help.</td>
      <td>The Friday approval of a second Covid vaccine is welcome news, but much of the public won’t be able to get inoculated for many months. Meanwhile, the best way to reduce suffering and hardship is therapeutic technologies like antibody drugs. But right now, many of these drugs are languishing on shelves at hospitals and not reaching patients.<br />Moncef Slaoui, who runs Operation Warp Speed, said recently that more than 80% of the available supply is sitting unused, even as hospitals are inundated with critically ill patients. Antibody drugs infuse patients with synthetic versions of the kinds of immune cells developed in response to an infection. Early trials show antibody cocktails can stop Covid symptoms from progressing. They can be used with or without vaccines for patients at highest risk of severe disease.<br />The supply is limited. The two companies with authorized versions, Eli Lily and Regeneron, will ship a little more than one million doses by the end of the year. Evidence suggests that for every 10 high-risk patients treated, one hospitalization might be avoided. That may sound modest, but it adds up: a million doses administered could translate into 100,000 fewer hospitalizations. Such a reprieve would help hospitals keep up with the current surge.<br />The biggest difficulty is logistical. Patients need to be referred for antibodies soon after diagnosis. The infusion takes several hours to prepare, deliver and monitor. A specialized nurse must supervise, with protective equipment, in a space separate from other patients to minimize spread.<br />Most early doses have been going to hospitals. But many hospitals are strapped by Covid and having a hard time setting up dedicated space and redirecting trained nursing and support staff. The government should send more antibodies to community infusion centers and clinics that have taken steps to administer doses. These clinics can work with testing sites to speed referrals.</td>

      <td>Children under 10 can’t be expected to stare at a computer for hours.</td>
      <td>Online learning is especially difficult for young children, and schools are blaming parents. A woman came to see me because her 8-year-old daughter’s school recommended neuropsychological evaluation. Each day the girl was expected to sit in a chair, stare at a computer for hours, listen, memorize and repeat. Not surprisingly, she had trouble staying engaged, often got up and moved around, and was distracted when the teacher called on her. She had no learning or attention problems before Covid-19 and her reactions were perfectly normal. The problem was the school’s unrealistic expectations.<br />The pandemic and the shift to online learning seem to be intensifying the trend toward pathologizing ordinary childhood behavior. Diagnosing a child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder isn’t straightforward. It can be challenging to determine if the child’s behavior indicates a neurodevelopmental disorder or a natural response to a stressful and stifling environment. The prevalence of ADHD diagnoses among U.S. children and adolescents rose from 6.1% in 1997-98 to 10.2% in 2015-16 among U.S. children and adolescents. A 2015 study found a correlation between rates of ADHD diagnosis and laws penalizing school districts when students fail, suggesting that diagnostic rates can be influenced by policy.<br />Covid-19 shutdowns complicate the matter further. Teachers and administrators expect to be able to teach young children in the same way they did when they were face to face. But children under 10 have a hard time learning remotely, even if they clearly don’t have ADHD—and the younger the child, the more difficult the task. Young children are filled with exploratory energy, and need outlets for play and creativity.<br />That said, it is exciting to watch as education-technology entrepreneurs work to find solutions to this school failure. New online tutoring companies for young children use more creative and experiential methods of teaching, don’t expect children to stay online for long and have realistic expectations for what kids can learn in the online format. “Our children are feeling unheard and unseen, with a thoughtful, hands-on, playful and experiential approach remote learning can be successful for even the youngest of learners,” said Mary Cantwell, a co-founder of EnrichedNYC. “But the schools are not implementing such an approach. ”<br />As the second half of the school year begins, parents and teachers must accept that distraction and disengagement during online learning are normal, not pathological. Children are feeling frustrated and need compassion rather than judgment, criticism and impatience from the adults in their lives. For most, 2020-21 won’t be a year of great academic achievement. But it could be a year of strengthening relationships with family members, building resilience and emotional maturity, and learning to cope with the disappointment and adversity of missing friends and activities. The most important lessons for everyone this year will be learned outside the classroom.</td>

      <td>Many civilian lives could be saved by using tourniquets.</td>
      <td>Robyn Gardner lay bleeding by a river near Sacramento, Calif., her thigh ripped open by a boat’s propeller. A former Army medic happened to be nearby. He applied a tourniquet, which immediately stopped the bleeding and stabilized Gardner. But when the ambulance arrived, the crew removed the tourniquet, because tourniquets weren’t an approved trauma intervention in the jurisdiction. EMTs tried other techniques to control the bleeding, but Gardner died at 38 in 2003.<br />Tourniquets save lives, but an exaggerated fear of tissue damage led medical authorities to ban them from use on both military and civilian trauma patients. Some 3,400 American lives were lost in Vietnam from failure to use these simple devices.<br />That realization prompted a four-year review of battlefield trauma care, which led to the development of Tactical Combat Casualty Care, first described in 1996. TCCC recommends tourniquets for life-threatening extremity bleeding until the casualty reaches a surgeon. But most U.S. military units ignored the advice at first and didn’t carry tourniquets into Afghanistan and Iraq.<br />That changed as casualties mounted. In 2005 the U.S. Special Operations Command and the U.S. Central Command both mandated tourniquet use. Studies since have found hundreds of American lives have been saved on the battlefield with tourniquets and little danger of tissue damage.<br />Civilian trauma care has always benefited from military wartime experience, but the process can be slow. By 2010 tourniquets were routine in the military but rare outside it. Civilian tourniquet use increased significantly after 2013, when Hartford, Conn., trauma surgeon Lenworth Jacobs convened a group of experts to study ways of saving lives in civilian mass casualty incidents such as the Sandy Hook school shooting. The Hartford Consensus led the American College of Surgeons and the American College of Emergency Physicians to endorse tourniquet use by professional first responders.</td>

This repression has destroyed the lives of intellectuals.”<br />Lots of Cubans will tell you similar things privately, but few have dared utter them in public. Until now.<br />The San Isidro Movement was formed in 2018 to oppose a new law making it a crime to engage in performance art without permission from the Ministry of Culture. The group—made up of young adults of different races who are artists, writers, musicians, students, and researchers—hold a mix of political views but are united in their quest for freedom.</td>

The findings stem from the broadest review of agency enforcement efforts conducted in the wake of two fatal crashes of  Boeing Co. ’s 737 MAX jets.<br />Concluding that systemic FAA deficiencies pose an “unnecessary risk to the flying public,” the report cited a pattern of agency managers avoiding responsibility for failures to ensure proper staff training. Managers also undermined or overruled enforcement decisions of some inspectors, investigators determined.<br />“When inspectors pushed back,” according to the report, “they were investigated and in some cases reassigned.”<br />After examining some 13,000 pages of documents and interviewing dozens of agency employees, investigators described a “failed FAA safety management culture” tending to favor companies over FAA staff and “often accompanied by retaliation against those who report safety violations.”</td>

The Nov. 2 meeting took place a few days before Ant was supposed to go public, in what would have been the world’s biggest initial public offering.<br />Mr. Ma had angered Beijing by lashing out in a speech in October at President Xi Jinping’s signature campaign to control financial risks, saying it stifled innovation. Now, the regulators had called the meeting to voice their concerns about Ant’s business model.<br />His olive-branch offer at the meeting failed at saving the IPO and Beijing has since stepped up efforts to rein in China’s Big Tech giants.</td>

Mattis as the embodiment of the Marine Corps ethos. I still do. But I have come to believe that my vote was a mistake. Congress was wrong to exempt him from a legal prohibition on recently retired military officers serving as defense secretary. And Congress shouldn’t do the same for President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee, retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin.<br />Before Secretary Mattis, Congress had allowed only one exemption since passing the 1947 National Security Act, for Army Gen. George Marshall in 1950. Voting to allow a second exception didn’t seem like much of a threat to civil-military relations. Yet with the benefit of hindsight, I can see how Gen. Mattis’s tenure departed from norms in important ways. Despite my enormous respect for him and the exceptional National Defense Strategy he wrote at the Pentagon, his time as secretary reinforced why recently retired officers shouldn’t serve in this role.<br />Like many military officers, Secretary Mattis never seemed interested in the cabinet politics that come with the position. He avoided fights with fiscal hawks in the White House over defense spending, even as defense hawks in Congress begged him to make the case for additional dollars.<br />Secretary Mattis seemed to run the Pentagon like it was a combatant command. After hundreds of billions in defense cuts under the Obama administration, he rightly made a priority of improving readiness. But that came at the expense of long-term overhaul, despite bipartisan support for efforts like growing the Navy to 355 ships.<br />Additionally, Gen. Mattis brought a warfighting-first perspective to public relations. With no background in politics, he undervalued the importance of engaging the public on national-security issues and scaled back the department’s public release of information. This had the perverse effect of reducing the department’s ability to persuade Congress and the public in important bureaucratic fights.</td>

      <td>The U.S. must respond proportionally to the SolarWinds breach—and prepare for the next attack.</td>
      <td>The  SolarWinds  breach could be the most significant cyber incident in American history. Russian intelligence—likely the SVR, the foreign-intelligence branch—infiltrated and sat undetected on U.S. government networks for nearly 10 months. It was a sophisticated, smart and savvy attack that should alarm the public and private sectors.<br />We may not know the full extent of the damage for some time. Don’t be surprised if more government entities disclose that they too were victims of this attack. Don’t be surprised either if it emerges that private companies were hit. SolarWinds says it has more than 300,000 customers, including 400 companies in the Fortune 500. That’s a lot of potential victims.<br />It appears that this was purely an intelligence-gathering effort. The SVR sat on government networks collecting as much data as it could, whenever and however it wanted. It was less like tapping into phone lines and more like breaking into the library and wandering around.<br />Every country conducts espionage. That’s not the alarming part. What is truly scary is that the Russians are inside the house now. Who knows where they’ve planted malware, corrupted or deleted data, locked users out of systems, or destroyed systems entirely? Turning off the system and uninstalling SolarWinds software isn’t enough. It may take years and thousands of hours to unpack fully where the Russians hid themselves and their code.<br />Using a network-management company’s supply chain of updates to penetrate targeted networks is exceptionally smart. This tactic will spawn imitators, and not only among governments. Tools and techniques used by state actors quickly end up in the hands of criminals, especially when they work. Look how ransomware spread a few years ago.</td>

But releasing government-sponsored enterprises  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  from conservatorship with little capital and no reforms is no solution at all. It would undermine investor confidence, create volatility in the mortgage market and impede access to credit for consumers.

Moody’s  recently wrote that an exit from conservatorship without a government guarantee could result in a downgrade in the GSEs’ debt ratings.<br />The Mortgage Bankers Association doesn’t support an endless conservatorship; we believe the Treasury Department should work with the Federal Housing Finance Agency to implement reforms so that Fannie and Freddie can eventually operate outside of government control. These reforms include equal secondary market access for all lenders regardless of size, business model, or volume of loans delivered to the GSEs; strict limits on the size and use of the GSEs’ mortgage investment portfolios; and the promotion of credit-risk transfers to protect taxpayers.<br />Bob Broeksmit<br />President & CEO<br />Mortgage Bankers Association</td>

Yet by the time it reaches your door, it costs $18.91. Here’s the breakdown of nearly $10 in added charges:<br /><br />During the pandemic, people have been willing to pay the delivery upcharge as a way to exercise caution while procuring meals and groceries. Following the first round of shelter-in-place orders, suburbs drove the first profitable quarter for  DoorDash Inc.,  which owns Caviar. In April, Instacart Inc. experienced a 500% year-over-year increase in grocery orders. The company’s contractor shoppers became front-line workers overnight.<br />As states renew restrictions on indoor dining and extend stay-at-home orders across the country, delivery is top of mind once again. But consumers are growing wary of the inflated cost of delivery, and companies are offering users better deals, in exchange for loyalty. What is the best way to save money? Pay attention to the details.<br />Fees aren’t the only source of extra costs. The prices of individual items can be padded too.  Costco ,  for instance, doesn’t require its Instacart grocery-delivery customers to hold a $60-a-year membership the way in-store shoppers must, but it does charge higher prices on Instacart than in its warehouse, on top of surcharges.</td>

More states and localities have ordered restaurants to close their dining rooms again to curb the virus’s spread, with New York City among the latest to suspend indoor service earlier this month. Outdoor patios that helped carry restaurants through warmer months aren’t popular in much of the U.S. now, and landlords and suppliers who extended help earlier in the pandemic face challenges of their own after months of customers falling behind.<br />For independent restaurants, the cash crunch is forcing hard decisions about whether they should take on additional debt to survive—provided they can get loans at all.</td>

It also isn’t clear how the separation could legally occur without the administration proving to Congress that certain conditions required under the law have been met, the people said.<br />The move, which has been considered by officials in years past, is controversial because it could lead to the politicization of intelligence produced by the NSA, one of the primary feeders of highly sensitive information to the nation’s military. It also would amount to a sweeping bureaucratic restructuring of intelligence and cybersecurity agencies amid a change in administrations.<br />The plan under consideration was circulated among Pentagon officials in recent days, according to a U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter. It is supported by Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, who was installed at the Pentagon in early November. The plan appears to be a dusted-off version of one that was first floated inside the Pentagon by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, according to another U.S. official. “This is very preliminary,” the official said, adding that a meeting was scheduled for this coming week to discuss the proposal.</td>

In London, the new strain of the virus accounted for 62% of the new cases identified in the week through Wednesday.<br />Similar steps have been taken across Europe to beat back rising caseloads. In Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced Friday a total lockdown across the country for the first time since May to be in force over Christmas, from Dec. 24 until Jan. 6.</td>

He will remain in custody pending further investigation, the prosecutors added.<br />A lawyer for Mr. Brunel, Corinne Dreyfus-Schmidt, didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Preliminary charges are an important step in the French judicial process that indicates authorities are deepening an investigation. Mr. Brunel is now under the authority of three investigating magistrates, who will work with police to gather evidence to determine whether—and on what formal charges—Mr. Brunel should stand trial.<br />Mr. Brunel was detained this week as he attempted to board a flight to Senegal from Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport, part of a nearly year-and-a-half investigation into allegations of underage rape and sex trafficking committed in France or against French people by Epstein and his accomplices, prosecutors said.</td>

      <td>In many times and places, the joyful holiday has been a time for melancholy reflections and ghostly visitations.</td>
      <td>In this pandemic year, many of us will be celebrating Christmas under the shadow of grief and uncertainty. But Christmas, like the pagan winter festivals that preceded it, has always carried more than a hint of darkness. The joyous celebration of the birth of the Christian savior has often been an occasion for melancholy and nostalgia, particularly when families are separated by war or other tragic events.<br />In November 1863, during the Civil War, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s son Charles was seriously wounded in battle. A few weeks later on Christmas, Longfellow wrote “I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,” reflecting on how the carnage “mocks” the holiday’s promise of “peace on earth, good-will to men.” In 1943, Bing Crosby’s recording of the song “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” spoke to millions of soldiers and their families who couldn’t celebrate the holiday together: “I’ll be home for Christmas/If only in my dreams.” And in 1967, as war raged in Vietnam, Stevie Wonder’s “Someday at Christmas” looked forward, like Longfellow’s poem, to a happier future: “Someday at Christmas there’ll be no wars/When we have learned what Christmas is for.”<br />Christmas melancholy often takes a ghostly form. In the 19th century, telling ghost stories on Christmas Eve was popular in Britain and North America, a tradition that inspired many writers to create their own. The narrator of Henry James’s psychological horror story “The Turn of the Screw” calls it “gruesome, as, on Christmas Eve in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be.” Charles Dickens wrote a series of ghost stories published yearly at Christmas. “A Christmas Carol” is the most famous, but there were many others, including “The Signalman,” in which a railway worker receives spectral warnings of impending accidents. In the 20th century, continuing the tradition, Christmas has been a popular setting for horror movies, such as “Black Christmas” (1974) and “Krampus” (2015), which draws on German folklore about a demonic anti-Santa Claus who eats naughty children.<br />Many cultures have similar traditions about a Christmas visitor who punishes bad children, rather than bringing presents to good ones. In France, Père Fouettard (“Father Whipper”) is said to beat badly behaved children with a whip. On Christmas Eve in South Africa, homes may be haunted by Danny, a boy who was beaten to death by his grandmother for eating cookies left out for Santa.<br />Italy’s La Befana is more sad than scary. When the Christ child was born, she was invited by the three Magi to join them on the journey to Bethlehem, but she declined because she was too busy tending her house. She soon regretted her decision and went out to look for the wise men, but they were already gone. Ever since, on the Feast of the Epiphany—the holiday in early January that commemorates the visit of the Magi—she travels the world in search of the infant Jesus, leaving gifts for children wherever she stops.</td>

The firm invests in startups that are tackling problems faced by low-income communities around the world, providing seed money to companies such as PEG Africa, which provides solar home systems on credit to off-grid households across West Africa.</td>

Here are five areas likely to affect nearly all Americans, tech topics the incoming administration and its advisers have indicated will take precedence.<br />Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act is the legal principle that makes today’s internet possible—from  Facebook ,   Twitter  and TikTok to YouTube, Discord and Twitch. It protects companies from being held liable for what their users do online.<br />This made sense when online services were little more than tools for creating virtual billboards and mailing lists, but many of today’s platforms have evolved to include powerful artificial-intelligence algorithms that determine what shows up in people’s feeds. Critics on both sides of the political aisle say if companies control what people see, they should be responsible for what people see—and don’t see.<br />President Trump threatened to veto a recent defense-spending bill unless a provision to strike down Section 230 was included. Last December, Mr. Biden declared that Section 230 should be “revoked, immediately.”</td>

      <td>We know now that as Wall Street analysts were publishing their 2020 forecasts the virus that would upend them all was already spreading in Wuhan, China. Jonathan Golub was particularly unlucky: On Jan. 21, Mr. Golub, Credit Suisse’s chief U.S. equity strategist, upgraded his prediction for the S&P 500 to end the year at 3600.<br />Discounting the threat of Covid-19 that day was an easy mistake to make, and one I made too. But imagine he had spotted the epidemiological consequences, and correctly recognized that the economy would plunge into the deepest recession in centuries. Surely no one would have concluded that his bullish S&P forecast was way too cautious, and the S&P would be more than 100 points higher than he expected by December?<br />“We thought there was no environment that could be worse than 2008-9,” Mr. Golub says. “This [2020] made the Great Financial Crisis look like an appetizer. And yet the market did so well.”<br />Dozens of investors and bank strategists put out public prognostications for what would happen in the markets, but 2020’s combination was so unusual it was missed by everyone, so far as I can tell: a far weaker economy, far weaker earnings, but significantly higher stock prices, at least in the U.S.<br />By their nature, once-in-100-year events are hard to predict. But the real lesson of 2020 is that even correctly predicting fundamentals just isn’t enough. What mattered this year wasn’t earnings, but the speed and scale of the response by central banks and governments, alongside a recognition that the U.S. stock market doesn’t reflect the economy.</td>

The U.S. this week formally removed Sudan from its list of state-sponsors of terrorism, paving the way for the Northeast African nation to request help from the IMF and the World Bank and ensuring U.S. companies will have an easier time doing business in the country, Gabriele Steinhauser and Nicholas Bariyo report. The Trump White House promised to revoke the designation as part of a deal to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel.<br />In agreeing to the deal, the White House also said it would help reduce Sudan’s debt burden, which has swollen to $60 billion, or 200% of gross domestic product. Sudanese officials said Washington pledged tens of millions of dollars in direct support for its economy, which is struggling with annual inflation above 200%. This week, the U.S. Agency for International Development said it provided 65,000 metric tons of wheat to Sudan worth $20 million.<br />As well as agreeing to normalize ties with Israel, Sudan had to agree to pay $335 million for compensation to U.S. victims of the terrorist attacks, following several years of talks between Washington and Khartoum.<br />Mass kidnapping highlights failure of Nigeria’s fight against extremists. The kidnapping last Friday night of more than 300 boys from a boarding school in northwest Nigeria has shone a harsh light on the country’s government’s efforts to combat terrorism. Jihadist group Boko Haram said on Tuesday it had seized students from an all-boys school in Katsina—home town of President Muhammadu Buhari—to punish them for “un-Islamic practices.” Local officials said that 333 of the school’s 800 students were missing and assumed captive.</td>

      <td>The show, streaming now on HBO Max, reveals the many unwritten rules of dressing for success in investment banking for both men and women</td>
      <td>THE FIRST rule of dressing for a finance career: Never let them see you sweat. When you’re facing clients in that high-stakes world, a good suit and a fresh shirt convey coolness and calm even when you’re privately perspiring in your crevices. On the HBO show “Industry,” bankers have tricks to keep their fluids in check while they transfer ungodly amounts of money with one click: getting a just-pressed shirt delivered to their desks; popping a sporty “Midtown Uniform” vest over it to conceal underarm stains; keeping Kiehl’s facial mist within arm’s reach. This kind of granular detail pervades nearly every scene of the first season of the series, a look at how young people navigate their stressful, sweaty lives at Pierpoint & Co., a fictional investment bank in London.<br />The show examines how new recruits from different backgrounds try to crack the notoriously white, male, upper-class banking profession. Mastering the balance between fitting in and showing off is crucial, and fashion is key to that formula.<br />At first glance, the clothes on “Industry” look incredibly boring, which is the point. While none of the many real financiers I spoke with wished to be identified due to office confidentiality policies, all found the show’s costume design dead on, or, as one put it, “eerily accurate.” That’s to be expected: Right out of Oxford, the show’s early-30s co-creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay worked at  Rothschild  & Co. and  Morgan Stanley ,  respectively. While you might initially dismiss the show’s style as a flat reflection of corporate banality, the barely perceptible details of the characters’ clothing speak volumes.<br />“Everyone is blending in, but in these very subtle ways, they’re showing their power,” said Mr. Down, who told me that he and his co-creator are “obsessed with clothes” themselves. “It’s a very subtle and interesting way of telling a story and revealing character,” he continued.<br />The pair wrote nearly every single costume into the show, right down to the pieces’ brands. So when the character Yasmin (played by Marisa Abela) is lounging casually at home, she’s not just wearing any old jeans and sneakers. According to the script, her outfit comprises “lick-the-sole-new Common Projects, Acne Jeans, baby-cash Loro Piana polo neck.”</td>

      <td>A Whitney Museum exhibition spotlights the Pakistani-American artist, whose deft depictions of young gay men signal hope for the future of figurative painting.</td>
      <td>A good many figurative paintings these days seem to aspire to being cover illustrations for the New Yorker magazine. They have the kind of benign, politely progressive, op-ed flavor that hardly any educated urbanite can resist—a perfect match for the magazine’s covers, which have evolved over the decades from pictures of tweedy, upper-middle-class pleasures to, for lack of a better term, a persistent social conscience.<br />That’s not a bad thing, for either the periodical (as a subscriber, I await each week’s punchy premier pictorial), or today’s figurative painting—at least when it’s not strident, self-congratulatory, or mawkish. The work of Salman Toor—a Pakistani-American painter born in 1983 who depicts the lives of (in the words of the Whitney Museum of American Art’s press materials) “young, queer Brown men residing between New York City and South Asia”—is an exception to these debilities. Mr. Toor’s work is modestly original, deftly done, poignant, and—by its very existence and the Whitney’s giving it museum exposure in the free, ground-floor lobby gallery—evidence of hope for imperfect humanity.<br />“Salman Toor: How Will I Know,” a show of 15 oil paintings ranging in size from a little over a foot to more than four feet on a side, depicts young gay men—Mr. Toor and his friends—at home in groups and in pairs, in clubs, intimately alone, and, occasionally, in perilous situations with the police. The exhibition is Mr. Toor’s first museum solo show.<br />Mr. Toor can certainly draw. According to a Whitney website essay, the artist “spent years studiously poring over and copying the works of Rococo, Baroque, and Neoclassical-era artists like Caravaggio, Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, and Jean-Antoine Watteau, incorporating their styles into his own original compositions.” He obviously picked up what he needed to know there, and along the way added some semi-cartoonish aspects to his ultimately brushy painting style. He includes, for example, the comic-strip visual trope of light lines to show the glow of a computer screen. There’s considerable Daumier, and—Mr. Toor attended college in the U.S.—maybe even a little R. Crumb in his pictures. Mr. Toor’s people, with their Pinocchio noses, also look somewhat like marionettes. His work depicts, in part, the inherent tragedy of gay life in places where governments prosecute it, and also adds a faint tension to scenes of nominally comfy domesticity.<br />What’s most powerful in lending Mr. Toor’s paintings their emotive combination of fleeting, gossamer happiness and a semi-numbing societal oppression is his palette. His paintings range from those that are mostly neutrals (i.e., the colorlessness of getting by day-to-day) to those with large areas of turquoise (Mr. Toor has called green “a space of self”), with punctuations of rust red and tangerine. He gives a sense of atmosphere to otherwise flat backgrounds by articulating them with small patches of color.</td>

      <td>Congress considers countermanding Treasury with  tax benefits worth hundreds of billions of dollars for business owners</td>
      <td><br />WASHINGTON—Congress may be poised to deliver a tax benefit worth hundreds of billions of dollars to business owners who took Paycheck Protection Program loans.<br />The provision, part of the discussions over the year-end coronavirus relief bill, would ensure that PPP recipients can deduct the payroll costs and other expenses covered by forgiven loans, even though the loans themselves are tax-free income. The move would reverse a Treasury Department ruling that denied the deductions.<br />Lawmakers say they just want to clarify what Congress intended to do when it created the PPP and prevent unexpected tax bills from hitting business owners. Still, a full deduction could reduce federal revenue by about $200 billion, with a majority going to very high-income households, according to Adam Looney of the Brookings Institution, who is a former Obama administration official.<br />There is bipartisan agreement in Congress to overturn the Treasury decision that denied deductions and frustrated business owners. Some progressive groups and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued that the combination of tax-free income and deductible expenses amounted to double dipping, but the lobbying clout of business groups and senior lawmakers in both parties is countering that view.</td>

      <td>Perhaps the most influential executive at Google is a man who can’t write a line of code.<br />That is Kent Walker, the company’s chief legal officer and head of global affairs, whose role puts him at the center of the search giant’s antitrust challenges. It also gives him the power to lead the defense that will determine whether one of the world’s dominant conglomerates is able to keep growing—or gets clipped.<br />Google faces formidable legal challenges. Its parent,  Alphabet Inc.,  was sued by federal prosecutors in October for allegedly abusing monopoly power in its flagship search engine, and this week state attorneys general added their own pair of lawsuits targeting digital advertising, among other areas. Google broadly denies the claims and says it will contest them in court.<br />While some of the specific allegations are new, Google’s use of its power has been under scrutiny for at least a decade. Under Mr. Walker, who became chief legal officer in 2018, it has fended off inquiries in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, Italy, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and the U.K. without sustaining a meaningful blow. The European Union made the biggest splash, levying total fines of more than $10 billion, but since the first of the EU’s three decisions against Google landed in 2017, the company’s revenue and stock price have shot up by about half.<br />Mr. Walker, a 14-year company veteran, has long favored providing regulators with reams of data and paperwork, according to current and former employees, yet those tactics might be wearing thin.</td>

      <td>U.S. health regulators late Friday permitted use of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, the second shot to get the green light to help end the pandemic. The Food and Drug Administration’s authorization comes a week after the agency authorized the first shot in the U.S., from Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE. Moderna, a ten-year-old biotech that has never had a product cleared by the FDA, expects to deliver a total of 20 million doses by the end of December. Moderna shares rose 5.1% Thursday when an advisory panel cleared the way for Friday night’s authorization.<br />Exxon is going green(ish). The Texas-based oil giant pledged Monday to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations over the next five years and eliminate routine flaring, or burning, of methane from its oil-and-gas operations in the next decade. “We respect and support society’s ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and continue to advocate for policies that promote cost-effective, market-based solutions to address the risks of climate change,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said. The targets stop short of pledges by European peers, including BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC to reach net-zero carbon emissions—efforts Mr. Woods previously called a “beauty competition.” Exxon shares fell 3.6% Monday.<br />Ten states sued Google Wednesday, accusing the search giant of running an illegal digital-advertising monopoly and enlisting rival  Facebook Inc.  in an alleged deal to rig ad auctions. The following day, 38 states joined in an antitrust lawsuit that alleged the Alphabet Inc. unit maintained monopoly power over the internet-search market through anticompetitive contracts and conduct. Thursday’s suit asks the court to move to prevent Google from harming competition, “including but not limited to structural divestitures.” The Justice Department filed a similar suit Oct. 20. Alphabet shares fell 0.9% Thursday.<br />Boeing is taking a closer look at some of its 787s. The plane maker has expanded inspections of newly produced Dreamliners after finding more manufacturing defects., holding up deliveries. These delays threaten to add to Boeing’s financial strain as it struggles with fallout from the pandemic, which has sapped global demand for air travel and passenger jets. The wide-body Dreamliner passenger jets, which Boeing first delivered in 2011, have an excellent safety record, but the latest defects mark the fourth assembly-line lapse in recent months. Delivery data shows that November was the only month since 2013 without a Dreamliner delivery, other than May, when the pandemic forced Boeing to briefly close production facilities. Boeing shares fell 0.7% Monday.<br /></td>

Here’s what we know and don’t know.<br />The FDA authorized the vaccine to be administered to people 18 years and older to prevent Covid-19.<br />FDA staff reviewed data that Moderna provided to the agency from a clinical trial testing the company’s vaccine in about 30,000 people. FDA staff concluded the vaccine was highly effective at protecting against Covid-19 with symptoms, with no specific safety concerns that would preclude authorization. The FDA also considered the input from a committee of outside advisers, which voted Thursday 20 to 0, with one abstention, that the vaccine’s benefits outweighed its risks.<br />Within days. Moderna has been making doses of the vaccine so it would have supplies to ship if the FDA granted permission. Federal health officials have said shipments could start within 24 hours of authorization, which would mean hospitals and other vaccination sites get doses as early as Monday.<br />Vaccinations could start within a day or two of Moderna’s shipments, yet initial supplies will be very limited. Initially, about six million doses will be distributed. Moderna says it expects to have 20 million doses ready to ship by the end of the year, enough supply of the two-dose shot for 10 million people. Given such limited initial supplies of both Moderna’s vaccine and one from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech  SE, authorities are expected to prioritize shots for people at the highest risk of Covid-19, like doctors and nurses on the front lines of treating coronavirus patients, and residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities.</td>

We know China was enraged when Mr. Lai met with American politicians on trips to Washington in 2019, including Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the basis of the national security charge is that he’s encouraged foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and Beijing.<br />Mr. Lai has been denied bail and publicly exhibited in shackles. Ta Kung Pao, the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece in Hong Kong, says he should be extradited to the mainland for trial. Friends worry that would be a death sentence for the 72-year-old publisher.<br />President Xi Jinping is hoping to intimidate Hong Kongers into silence and testing whether Mr. Biden and his aides will look the other way at these and other abuses.

      <td>The fuss over President Trump’s order to exclude undocumented immigrants from the decennial reapportionment may be much ado about nothing. That’s essentially what a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court said Friday in dismissing a legal challenge (Trump v. New York) by Democratic states for lack of standing.<br />“A foundational principle of Article III is that ‘an actual controversy must exist not only at the time the complaint is filed, but through all stages of the litigation,’” the Court noted in an unsigned ruling with Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor dissenting.<br />Democratic states claimed they would lose federal funding and Congressional seats if the President’s order was implemented, though these harms are speculative. President Trump’s order directed the Commerce Secretary to gather information “to the extent practicable” and exclude undocumented aliens “to the extent feasible.”<br />The Justice Department conceded during oral arguments this month that the government lacked records on many of the 10.5 million or so undocumented immigrants in the country. It was also unclear whether the Census Bureau could even mesh the records in its possession with the decennial enumeration.<br />In other words, the order might not even be implemented, let alone harm Democratic states. “At present, this case is riddled with contingencies and speculation that impede judicial review,” the Court noted.</td>

      <td>You know a security breach is bad when no one in government wants to talk about it. That appears to be the case with what is being called a Russian cyber attack on at least six U.S. cabinet-level departments that has come to light in the last week.<br />U.S. officials briefed on the breach are telling reporters that it appears to have begun when hackers broke into the systems of  SolarWinds Corp. , a private company that contracts with U.S. agencies, defense contractors and other corporations. SolarWinds isn’t saying much, and neither are the feds.<br />But reports say the departments of State, Treasury, Homeland Security, Energy, Commerce and the National Institutes of Health were compromised. These agencies contain countless secrets and data that could be useful to an adversary. The Energy Department supervises many of America’s nuclear weapons facilities, and Treasury monitors global terror financing.<br />Some reports say no classified information was compromised, but more disconcerting is that no one seems to know for sure. U.S. officials still don’t know the extent of the cyber breach, how long the hackers have had access to U.S. systems, or how they were able to go undetected for so long. The U.S. has spent tens of billions on cyber defenses in a project known as Einstein, yet it appears to have been the cyber equivalent of France’s Maginot Line on the German border in 1940.<br />President Trump has said nothing, which is not his habit. Some Democratic politicians have expressed horror after briefings, but they can’t be trusted about anything related to Russia and the Trump Administration.</td>

      <td>Why the ‘iron apparatus’ of the scientific method counts for more than any single genius.</td>
      <td>Among the missed opportunities in my life, the elaborate physics kit my parents gave me for my 10th birthday reigns supreme. Intimidated by the sheer number of parts, I never performed any of the experiments, but I remember being mightily pleased with the manual that came with it, a spiral-bound paean to the rigors of scientific tinkering.<br />Memories of that pleasure came flooding back to me as I was reading Michael Strevens’s riveting book “The Knowledge Machine.” A philosopher of science at New York University, Mr. Strevens doesn’t hide his light under a bushel. “In this book,” he tells us, “you will discover how science really works.” Forget those flashes of serendipitous insight that you were told precede scientific discovery, the magical dream in which the periodic table appeared to Dmitri Mendeleev, or the mysterious fluorescent glow Wilhelm Röntgen beheld in his cathode tube that led to the development of the X-ray. Post-Newtonian science, for Mr. Strevens, is all about measurements and their gradual experimental refinement; it is, as he informs us with grim delight, inhuman, repetitive and sterile, an insensible machine bent solely on the production of facts about the observable world. What keeps it running is the “iron rule of explanation,” a firm set of standards by which all scientists are expected to abide. Those standards decide what counts as evidence and what doesn’t: They sift the wheat of truth from the chaff of falsehoods and control who comes out on top (and, if very lucky, bags a Nobel Prize). The knowledge machine doesn’t need dreams or magic to function. And, as Mr. Strevens admits, it doesn’t need a philosopher of science either.<br />Undaunted, Mr. Strevens promises his readers a better explanation of scientific progress than those given by his two illustrious predecessors, Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn. Where Popper envisioned scientific truth rising from a “mass extermination of hypotheses,” Kuhn saw it happening through paradigm changes by which a new way of scientific thinking creeps up on and eventually obliterates another, older, exhausted one. Mr. Strevens’s machine, by contrast, isn’t driven by revolutions or falsification efforts. Like the deadly apparatus in Kafka’s famous story “In the Penal Colony,” it works slowly, indifferently, oblivious to the world around it. Supremely self-sufficient, it is immune to the potshots of the “radical subjectivists,” those humanists or sociologists, disdained by Mr. Strevens, who believe that science has no special claim to objectivity. While the results of the machine’s work are open to debate, the machine itself is not; it is that stubborn imperviousness that, to the outside observer, seems “irrational.”<br />Mr. Strevens sustains his polemical fireworks with a steady succession of examples drawn from the history of science. A clear favorite among those is the observational test of Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity that was initiated, a century ago, by British astronomers Frank Watson Dyson and Arthur Eddington. Hoping to measure what Einstein had predicted, the deflection, or bending, of light by the sun’s gravitational field, Eddington dispatched his teams to photograph a total solar eclipse on the island of Príncipe off the coast of West Africa and in Sobral in northern Brazil. Things did not go smoothly. Heavy clouds made all but two of the Príncipe plates unusable, and the larger of the two telescopes in Sobral yielded only blurry results. But, eager to patch up what World War I had torn asunder, Eddington declared the venture a success and the German-born Einstein vindicated. His official account of the experiment, deferring to the “iron rule,” makes no mention of his personal motivations. Eddington’s experiment, still being debated today, must be judged (and Mr. Strevens shows us how) on the plausibility of the published assumptions and the strength of the data it delivers, without regard to what had happened behind the scenes.<br />When left to its own devices, science will advance and eventually save us from ourselves. Or so Mr. Strevens assures us in his final, pandemic-inflected chapter. But it’s awfully hard to keep the noisy world at bay. Even Eddington’s report is not as anodyne as one might expect. Tucked in between tables dense with measurements, we get fulsome praise for the beautiful scenery on Príncipe as well as hints at the difficulties Eddington’s men encountered, including the Royal Observatory carpenter who couldn’t help because he was still in the military, the steamship company that went on strike, and the ice that wasn’t available when the negatives had to be developed. Did Eddington merely neglect to clean up his writing? Or did he let those details stand because they reinforce his view, expressed at the end of the article, that his experiments should be repeated, presumably with even better results, “at future eclipses”?</td>

      <td>Sportswear giant reports higher profit and revenue, boosted by China and 84% jump in digital sales</td>
      <td>Nike Inc.’s  pivot to e-commerce has helped the sneaker giant power through the coronavirus pandemic.<br />On Friday, the company said its flagship brand’s digital revenue increased 84% in the quarter ended Nov. 30, which included Black Friday. The strong sales from Nike’s websites and mobile apps—along with strong demand in China—helped the company log overall sales gains and higher profits than the year-ago period.<br />“These are times when strong brands get stronger,” Chief Executive John Donahoe said on a conference call. He said the latest results reflect the strength of Nike’s strategy and that he was optimistic about the Covid-19 vaccine.<br />Nike is among several retailers that have benefited from earlier efforts to capture online sales. Before the pandemic hit, the sportswear giant had been beefing up its direct-to-consumer business through its own website and stores. It pared back the number of wholesale stores that could sell its goods and parted ways with  Amazon.com Inc.  last year. It also had been investing in apps for shopping, selling sneakers and guided workouts.<br />In the early months of the pandemic, Nike closed stores and continued to pay its workers, but doubled down on digital sales while consumers were confined to their homes. On Friday, the company said more than 90% of its owned stores were open during the quarter, but they continued to experience declines in traffic due to the pandemic and safety-related measures.</td>

      <td>A proposed wealth tax would apply for a decade to anyone who spends 60 days in the state in a single year.</td>
      <td>California’s Legislature is considering a wealth tax on residents, part-year residents, and any person who spends more than 60 days inside the state’s borders in a single year. Even those who move out of state would continue to be subject to the tax for a decade—a provision that calls to mind the Eagles’ famous “Hotel California” lyric: “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.”<br />The California Constitution probably allows a statewide wealth tax on residents, but any effort to create a tax capable of reaching across state borders is likely to run afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Taxing someone who spends only 60 days in the state in any single year—and extending that tax over an ensuing decade—would be something new under the sun.<br />Each year this tax net would gather up a new crop of taxpayers for the next decade. The range of people it proposes to ensnare is staggering: every student attending college in California, anyone having a major medical procedure at a California hospital and needing an extended in-state recovery period, and those who spend two months in California away from New York or London winters. Under California tax law, there is no distinction between a nonresident from Minnesota and a nonresident from Dubai.<br />Assembly Bill 2088 proposes calculating the wealth tax based on current world-wide net worth each Dec. 31. For part-year and temporary residents, the tax would be proportionate based on their number of days in California. The annual tax would be on current net worth and therefore would include wealth earned, inherited or obtained through gifts or estates long before and long after leaving the state.<br />The proposed wealth tax would fall on a star high-school or college athlete who grows up in California but becomes a wealthy professional in another state after graduation. It would grab a scientist who develops a drug to cure cancer years after leaving California. A grandchild who spent a single summer surfing in Southern California would be subject to the tax. It would include anyone returning home to a foreign country after 60 days in California.</td>

      <td>Green pork will do less good than getting out of the way for energy technology and investment.</td>
      <td>Find a spot on your refrigerator for a quote Vice President-elect Kamala Harris made shortly before the election. “Do you believe climate change is happening and threatening the air we breathe and the water that we drink?” That is, having invoked the sacred term, she proceeded to evince zero understanding of what the issue is all about. Her careless rhetoric is more representative than you might think.<br />Let’s understand: In the long run, a human impact on climate change will be determined by two things—how much warming CO2 causes and how much CO2 is emitted. The United Nations climate panel consults two dozen models to forecast that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 would eventually boost temperatures by 2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The panel aggregates the results of so many models because its scientists can’t empirically verify any of them.<br />On future emissions, it has long been understood that human carbon output has been growing at roughly half the RCP 8.5 rate cited in universally adopted worst-case scenarios. Credit goes to large economic and demographic trends: richer societies, smaller families, more-service-based economies. A U.N. working document expects these trends to unfold regardless of whether governments enact policies specifically “to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a goal in itself.”<br />Policy ideas nevertheless leap to mind that would enhance these dynamics. Unfortunately, after 30 years, climate policy as practiced in the advanced economies has been overtaken by what the economist Bruce Yandle calls Baptist-and-bootlegger incentives. Policy formation has been captured by those with a financial stake in green subsidies irrespective of any climate benefit.<br />Which brings us to the Joe Biden administration. Look at the dutiful drudges he’s putting in charge: John Kerry, former Obama EPA chief Gina McCarthy, former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm. These people, above all, are reliable: They can be trusted not to say that electric cars are a distraction and bauble for the upper middle classes, that nuclear power is essential, that heavy-handed regulation will kill more jobs than it creates, that a carbon tax would be a far more efficient way to discourage emissions than the green socialism Democrats have embraced.</td>

      <td>In the fight to control Covid-19, public fears and policymakers’ hubris make a powerful combination.</td>
      <td>It’s easy to lament, as Nicholas Christakis does several times in “Apollo’s Arrow: The Profound and Enduring Impact of Coronavirus on the Way We Live” (Little, Brown Spark, 368 pages, $29), how quickly the Covid-19 pandemic was “politicized.” But politics is fundamentally about how people live peaceably with each other. Any corporate response to a disease involves power and compulsion and is, by definition, political.<br />Dr. Christakis, a physician and professor of sociology at Yale University’s Human Nature Lab, chronicles the molecular origins of the new coronavirus and the governmental and societal responses to it in the U.S. “Apollo’s Arrow” is a capably written and impressively argued book.<br />Dr. Christakis rejects the belief, held by a substantial minority of Americans, that the U.S. public response to the virus was overwrought and foolish. “I share the view of many good scientists,” he writes, “that vastly more Americans would have died—perhaps a million—had we failed to deploy the resources we marshaled, belatedly, in the spring of 2020.” By “the resources we marshaled” I assume he doesn’t primarily mean masks and social distancing but the lockdowns and school closures that have brought about so much economic destruction, loneliness, depression and social discord. Dr. Christakis acknowledges these as costs, but he treats them as basically necessary. I’m not sure. The argument that things would have been much worse if we hadn’t done what we did—like many such retroactive justifications for disastrous government policies—is conveniently self-exculpatory and unfalsifiable.<br />I mean no disrespect to the author when I suggest that public-health experts, particularly the highly accomplished ones who are employed by elite universities, don’t seem to understand American culture all that well. “It’s only when you can test, trace, and isolate,” he writes, “that you can break the chains of transmission and bring a virus under control.” That is no doubt factually true, but contact tracing and isolation—and by the latter term he doesn’t only mean self-isolation—require the kind of coercive governmental measures that East Asian countries mostly permit and the U.S. Constitution mostly does not. An immense, decentralized nation like the United States, whose citizens jealously guard their personal liberties and often feel no obligation to comply with the dictates of bureaucrats, was always going to do a lousy job of breaking the “chains of transmission.”<br />It’s easy to forget, reading Dr. Christakis’s confident pronouncements, that public-health “experts” have never encountered anything like the Covid-19 pandemic. Expertise is conferred by experience, but who had experienced a pandemic in which actual case numbers dwarf confirmed case numbers, in which asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people have strong disincentives to get tested, and in which the young are, or at least appear to be, far less vulnerable than the old? The correct answer is no one. But that doesn’t stop Dr. Christakis from sounding like a disappointed tutor. “If the country were a student in one of my courses,” he writes in a revealing sentence, “I would not hesitate to hand it an F.”</td>

      <td>From solitary suffering to madness in company, Zadie Smith traces the pandemic’s marks on the human heart.</td>
      <td>It is rare, in the midst of an experience, to become conscious of it as such—as a thing that will shape us, mark us, mean something. Usually we are too caught up in the current; we have to climb up on the bank and dry off before we can begin to see that the experience—just then, just there—changed us. But sometimes a moment comes along, in our private lives or our collective ones, that overwhelms us immediately with the awareness of its being a thing that matters. This year, from the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, has been that sort of moment, surreally extended and bloated, composed of a cascade of mini-moments too rapid to process. What does it mean? we’ve sputtered as it hit us. Where will it leave its mark on us (individually, collectively)? How will it appear when we look back on it years from now?<br />Writing, suggests the English novelist Zadie Smith,  is an attempt to control the mystifying rush of experience—to “take this largely shapeless bewilderment and pour it into a mold.” In “Intimations,” her new collection of essays, Ms. Smith gives form to our experience of 2020. Written during the early months of the pandemic, these six short pieces parse its first traces—the intimations of virus or, as Ms. Smith calls it, “the global humbling.” They are lean and powerful—the collection is less than 100 pages—like pencil sketches that capture a scene or a figure in a few brief masterly strokes. When we do look back on this period, these are among the essays we will turn to.<br />“Peonies” opens in the last days of normalcy before lockdown, Ms. Smith suddenly pausing in the middle of her rushed routine to stare at flowers springing up in the middle of New York City. She is drawn by instinct, her fingers curled around the bars of the garden gate. The episode is “a tiny, early preview of what I now feel every moment of every day, that is, the complex and ambivalent nature of ‘submission,’ ” she writes. She gestures to ways we’ve had to accommodate resistance and submission, fighting the virus by submitting—to mask-wearing, to staying home, to a new reality.<br />In “The American Exception,” she considers death and its uneven distribution in America: “The virus map of the New York boroughs turns redder along precisely the same lines as it would if the relative shade of crimson counted not infection and death but income brackets and middle-school ratings.” Far from being a great equalizer, the pandemic has highlighted the old hierarchies. Will Americans, jolted out of complacency, change this state of affairs? Will we go back to forgetting the underpaid workers we now applaud as “essential”? Ms. Smith draws on the example of postwar Europe which, after years of death, decided that healthcare shouldn’t be dictated by private interests.<br />The essays that follow—on time and suffering—continue to probe the disparities in our experience of the pandemic. Our relation to time has been altered, but there are workers who don’t need to fill time, whose days are overburdened with essential tasks, and there is everyone else, with some time to fill. In “Something to Do,” she weighs the existential problem of how we do time, which the pandemic has thrown into sharp new light. “Like pugs who have been lifted out of a body of water, our little limbs keep pumping on, as they did when we were hurrying off to our workplaces.” We bake banana bread, we paint, we make a video. But without love, she concludes, life is just doing time: “Busyness will not disguise its lack.”</td>

The initiative guarantees all of them a weekly, at-home nasal swab and a lab analysis—whether they are reporting for duty in-person, or not. The company is recommending that every staffer be tested weekly.<br />The offer proved so popular that Google’s internal website for it crashed shortly after going live Thursday. Employees at Google’s flagship search properties, as well as company arms including YouTube, Google X, fiber internet and artificial intelligence, all have access to the testing. International Google employees will be offered access starting next year.<br />While other companies, ranging from  Tyson Foods Inc.  to  Delta Air Lines Inc.,  have begun testing staff who report on-site, Google’s appears to be the largest yet aimed at employees stuck at home since March. Google staff since that time has been under a work-from-home order, recently extended to September 2021.<br />The polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests look for the virus’s genetic material in samples collected by a self-administered nasal swab. Google contracted with health-care firm BioIQ Inc. to send out the kits and find the laboratories where the results can be processed quickly.</td>

It said it would continue to restrict dividend payouts.<br />Under two hypothetical scenarios, in which unemployment remains high and the economy doesn’t bounce back for several quarters, the 33 largest U.S. banks could be hit with as much as $600 billion in loan losses, the Fed said in the latest iteration of its stress test.

At that time, the Fed stopped all buybacks and said dividends couldn’t exceed a bank’s recent profits. The Fed in September extended the restrictions through the end of this year.</td>

      <td>The cocktail was invented in the U.S., but it soon became a worldwide symbol of sophistication.</td>
      <td>Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today’s world. Read previous columns here.<br />In 1887, the Chicago Tribune hailed the martini as the quintessential Christmas drink, reminding readers that it is “made of Vermouth, Booth’s Gin, and Angostura Bitters.” That remains the classic recipe, even though no one can say for certain who created it.<br />The journalist H.L. Mencken famously declared that the martini was “the only American invention as perfect as the sonnet,” and there are plenty of claimants to the title of inventor. The city of Martinez, Calif., insists the martini was first made there in 1849, for a miner who wanted to celebrate a gold strike with something “special.” Another origin story gives the credit to Jerry Thomas, the bartender of the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, in 1867.<br />Of course, just as calculus was discovered simultaneously by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, the martini may have sprung from multiple cocktail shakers. What soon made it stand out from all other gin cocktails was its association with high society. The hero of “Burning Daylight,” Jack London’s 1910 novel about a gold-miner turned entrepreneur, drinks martinis to prove to himself and others that he has “arrived.” Ernest Hemingway paid tribute to the drink in his 1929 novel “A Farewell To Arms” with the immortal line, “I had never tasted anything so cool and clean. They made me feel civilized.”<br />Prohibition was a golden age for the martini. Its adaptability was a boon: Even the coarsest bathtub gin could be made palatable with the addition of vermouth and olive brine (a dirty martini), a pickled onion (Gibson), lemon (twist), lime cordial (gimlet) or extra vermouth (wet). President Franklin D. Roosevelt was so attached to the cocktail that he tried a little martini diplomacy on Stalin during the Yalta conference of 1945. Stalin could just about stand the taste but informed Roosevelt that the cold on the way down wasn’t to his liking at all.</td>

But by Friday afternoon, it was clear that a coronavirus aid package wouldn’t be finalized in time to pass with a spending bill needed to avoid a government shutdown at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.<br />“There’s some always last-minute stuff that pops up, but it’s coming together,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R., S.D.) said of the negotiations. “I think we have to assume that even when there’s a deal announced, that by the time it gets written up and processed, we’re going to be pushing through the weekend.”<br />Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said on the Senate floor Friday morning that talks continued to make progress. “I am even more optimistic now than I was last night that a bipartisan, bicameral framework for a major rescue package is close at hand,” he said.</td>

In September, the Times noted on Friday, Mr. Chaudhry was arrested by Canadian police and charged with perpetrating a terrorist hoax. Efforts to reach Nader R.

Mr. Hasan told the Times that Mr. Chaudhry would oppose the hoax charge.<br />The “Caliphate” series is one of the newspaper’s best-known podcasts, winning a 2018 Peabody Award in the radio/podcast category for what jurors cited as “a wonderful example of what longform audio reporting can and should sound like.” A spokesperson for the Peabody Awards wasn’t immediately available for comment.<br />Separately, the Overseas Press Club of America said on its website that it has rescinded its 2018 Lowell Thomas Award for “Caliphate,” citing conclusions raised by the Times’s internal review.

      <td>The Dallas Fed president said he remains concerned extended periods of bond buying could bring problems</td>
      <td>Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said Friday that he believes it will be time for the central bank to start pulling back on its bond-buying stimulus efforts when it is clear the economy is recovering strongly.<br />“I’m going to deliberately stay away from a timetable,” Mr. Kaplan said in a Wall Street Journal interview. However, Mr. Kaplan said that as 2021 moves forward and vaccines to treat Covid-19 roll out, if the Fed is “making substantial progress on our dual mandate goals, I do think it would be healthy and very appropriate to begin the process of tapering our asset purchases.”<br />Tapering means slowing the monthly buying pace on the way toward ending the effort.<br />Mr. Kaplan said he remains concerned extended periods of bond buying could bring problems. “These purchases, if they go on for longer than they need to, I worry that they have some distorting impact on price discovery, that they encourage excessive risk taking, and excessive risk taking can create excesses and imbalances that can be difficult to deal with in the future.”<br />Mr. Kaplan has been a voting member at this year’s Federal Open Market Committee meetings, and his comments Friday were the first since that body met this week. On Thursday, the Fed said it was holding its short-term rate target at near-zero levels, where it will likely stay for several years to come, and pressing forward with $120 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage-bond buying. Those purchases are aimed at supporting financial markets and keeping real world borrowing costs low.</td>

It has now gained more than 13% year-to-date.<br />Gains accelerated Thursday, spurred by fears the U.S. might reapply sanctions on  United Co. Rusal  International PJSC, a Russian aluminum producer and major supplier to Europe. Previous sanctions against the company sparked a steep climb in prices for the metal, disrupting the aluminum industry and threatening profits at manufacturers such as Boeing and Ford.<br />Aluminum’s recent surge extends a rebound from its early-year drop, when investors feared demand would slide precipitously as auto makers halted production and planes were grounded. Many industrial metals have notched gains recently, fueled by a faster-than-expected recovery in China, a key source of global demand for commodities.<br />Demand also has come from one unexpected source: beverage cans.

      <td>WASHINGTON—A divided Supreme Court dismissed a challenge to President Trump’s plan to exclude immigrants in the U.S. illegally from the counts used to determine congressional seats, with the conservative majority saying it was premature to rule before it was clear that the outgoing administration could implement the policy.<br />The justices voted 6-3 to dismiss the case. In a dissent, the court’s three liberals argued that there was no need to wait before ruling that Mr. Trump’s initiative violated federal law.<br />The Trump administration’s plan, announced in July, could shift House seats from immigrant-rich states such as California to more rural, Republican-leaning areas with less diverse populations. Under federal law, state population totals must be sent to the president by Dec. 31 and he must deliver them to the newly elected House within a week of its opening, which normally occurs Jan. 3.<br />But the 2020 census count, disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, is behind schedule, and a House committee said earlier this month that the figures wouldn’t be ready before Jan. 23. That is three days after Mr. Trump leaves office, meaning that President-elect Joe Biden could cancel the exclusion plan once he is sworn in.<br />Even if Mr. Trump is able to transmit numbers before Jan. 20, an administration lawyer told the Supreme Court at a hearing last month that it wasn’t clear how many noncitizens lacking legal status feasibly could be removed from the apportionment base.</td>

According to the Tribune’s Ms. Yin:<br />Besides a generally cooperative federal executive branch, Mr. Obama has also benefited from the decisions of the federal judiciary. Specifically, his project might not be on the brink of success were it not for the careful reasoning and sound textualism of a Trump appointee to the federal bench.

      <td>The departing attorney general talks about John Durham, Robert Mueller, Hunter Biden, Mike Flynn and the flak he’s taken from both parties.</td>
      <td>The U.S. attorney general is meditating on one of his frustrations with the modern Justice Department: The outside world keeps moving faster; the wheels of justice ever more slowly. “Nobody wants to take responsibility anymore,” William Barr says with a hint of incredulity. “They wring their hands and push issues around the bureaucracy and trade memos for months.” His response: “Bring it to me! I’ll make the decision. That’s what I’m here for!”<br />If Mr. Barr, 70, dominated headlines over the past two years, it’s because he made a lot of tough calls. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s constitutionally dubious claims that President Trump committed obstruction of justice? No. An investigation of the 2016 Russia-collusion probe and the dismissal of charges against Mike Flynn? Yes. New oversight of sensitive political investigations and surveillance of U.S. citizens? Yes. A criminal referral about Mr. Trump’s call to the Ukrainian president? No. Repeated demands—from the left and the right—for his department to engage in politics? No, no, no.<br />Consequential decisions have a way of annoying people—Democrats, Republicans, the staff, one’s boss—but Mr. Barr, who’d been attorney general before, from 1991-93, knew that going in. “I’m in a position in life where I can do the right thing and not really care about the consequences,” he told senators during his January 2019 confirmation hearing. In a 90-minute phone interview Tuesday—less than 24 hours after the announcement of his resignation, effective Dec. 23—he sounded his usual spirited self.<br />He reminds me why he took the job in the first place: “The Department of Justice was being used as a political weapon” by a “willful if small group of people,” who used the claim of collusion with Russia in an attempt to “topple an administration,” he says. “Someone had to make sure that the power of the department stopped being abused and that there was accountability for what had happened.” Mr. Barr largely succeeded, in the process filling a vacuum of political oversight, reimposing norms, and resisting partisan critics on both sides.<br />Mr. Barr describes an overarching objective of ensuring that there is “one standard of justice.” That, he says, is why he appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate the FBI’s 2016 Crossfire Hurricane probe. “Of course the Russians did bad things in the election,” he says. “But the idea that this was done with the collusion of the Trump campaign—there was never any evidence. It was entirely made up.” The country deserved to know how the world’s premier law-enforcement agency came to target and spy on a presidential campaign.</td>

As I scanned the empty desks where my colleagues and I used to banter in an open newsroom-like setting, I was beholding the ghost town that has become the white-collar workplace.<br />I’d only visited a few times since March, to retrieve items like the mail and my checkbook. Like many professionals, I’ve found a comfortable way to work from home, at a laptop in the dining room next to my wife. But on this particular day our son had politely evicted us and our dog so he could be free of disruptions during a virtual medical-school interview. Never one to set up shop in  Starbucks ,  I had only one option for getting anything done—the office. I traipsed 40 blocks to Columbus Circle to try to experience work the way it used to be.<br />New York’s business corridors have remained mostly abandoned during Covid. In late October, one survey estimated office occupancy at 10%. The figure has surely dropped amid the latest surge. While big banks and real-estate firms have required employees to be on site at least part of the time, smaller shops like mine have kept their distance, turning offices into expensive storage lockers.<br />My building on Broadway and 57th Street, which ironically completed a seven-year renovation last year, has all the requisite fortifications: a plexiglass-shielded front desk, hand sanitizers and social-distancing markers. The elevator posts a scary warning about aerosol droplets and instructions not to speak. But no one was around. The masked security guard confirmed that many tenants have moved out and others are staying away. It seemed a droplet-free environment: I could have belted out an aria without hitting anyone.</td>

      <td>It appears spying, not destruction, was the aim; U.S. officials have yet to define precise impact of the suspected Kremlin intrusion</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Despite its size, a sprawling computer hack blamed on Russia could leave President Trump and the incoming Biden administration struggling to find the right response, former U.S. cybersecurity officials and experts said.<br />While Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) called the breaches that hit at least six cabinet-level departments as well as private companies “virtually a declaration of war,” the former officials said the intrusions fell more along the lines of classic digital espionage, however brazen. As far as is known from descriptions of the hack, no data was altered or destroyed, and no computer systems or other infrastructure damaged.<br />Further complicating any consideration of response options is that U.S. officials are only now beginning to understand the breadth and severity of the hack. Because of the careful and stealthy nature of the incursion,  a full damage assessment and recovery operation “is a months, if not yearslong, ordeal,” a senior intelligence official said.<br />“The scope of it is pretty stunning,” the official said. “The most disconcerting thing is the uncertainty around what [computer] systems they are in.”  The official added that there was no evidence that classified systems had been violated, but cautioned that was a preliminary conclusion.<br />Past U.S. responses to Russian hacking and disinformation operations—sanctions, property seizures, diplomatic expulsions, even the cyber equivalent of warning shots—appear to have done little to dissuade the Kremlin. Moscow has denied responsibility for the latest incursion.</td>

      <td>Traders are bracing for big swings in stock, options markets ahead of electric-car maker’s addition to index Monday</td>
      <td>Tesla Inc.  will officially join the S&P 500 Monday, likely precipitating a frenzied Friday afternoon in markets.<br />The electric-car maker will be by far the largest firm by market value ever to join the S&P, the most widely tracked stock index. Tesla’s inclusion will prompt the dozens of index funds that track the S&P to seek to purchase tens of billions of dollars of stock at Friday’s closing price, in a bid to track the index as closely as possible. Because of the firm’s size and the volatility of its shares, Tesla’s addition may ripple through the market in additional, unpredictable ways, traders said.<br />A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices, which oversees the S&P 500, said the company consulted with market participants and communicated the addition to the market “far in advance of typical index changes.”<br />Here are five things to watch:<br />Tesla’s addition to the S&P 500 coincides with quadruple witching, which occurs four times a year and refers to the day that options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. These heavy volumes will boost liquidity and will likely help smooth the addition of Tesla to the S&P, traders have said.</td>

      <td>What happens to your Facebook and Google accounts—and other digital stuff—when you die? Nothing if you don’t make a plan.</td>
      <td>Earlier this year, I recorded my mother talking about her life.<br />A few weeks later, after a complication with a routine medical procedure, she was in an intensive care unit, fighting for that life.<br />In some dark twist of fate, I got the call to come to the hospital as I was filming a scene for a Wall Street Journal documentary on death and technology. It was my work on that project that prompted me to ask her how she wants to be remembered.<br />Today she is back to her healthy self. But the lesson lived on for both of us—and far too many others in 2020: It’s never too early to plan for the inevitable.<br />Years ago, when our loved ones would die, we’d uncover their photos and 35mm slides in a shoebox, their letters shoved into the back of a desk. If we were lucky, we’d find old VHS tapes or cassettes with recorded stories. Today, we have more video, audio and photos than ever before, but they’re often locked away, trapped behind layers of usernames, passwords and texted security codes.</td>

      <td>Mozart may be famed as a prodigy, but Jan Swafford celebrates his apprehension of humanity in full.</td>
      <td>One January night in 1761, little Wolfgang Mozart insisted on playing a challenging harpsichord piece he had just heard performed by his older sister, already a virtuoso. He had never played a keyboard before. At the beginning of “Mozart: The Reign of Love” (don’t let the sappy subtitle put you off), the esteemed composer and biographer Jan Swafford writes:<br /><br /><br />Three years later, on his first visit to London, the prodigy, it was reported, was rolling around on a table when someone handed him a song by Johann Christian Bach. “The boy glanced at the score upside down, pointed out a wrongly copied note, and continued his roll on the table.”<br />Mr. Swafford delights in repeating these stories—it’s one of the pleasures of this comprehensive and engaging biography. He is thoroughly up-to-date on the latest information and controversies, debunking the still commonly held mythology about the composer, and he continually reminds us of what astounding music Mozart wrote: “No artist,” Mr. Swafford asserts, “made more of pleasure—made it deeper, more liberated, more sensual.”</td>

      <td>The professor and author hopes to expand humanities offerings on campus, even for scientists and engineers</td>
      <td>Andrew Delbanco recalls teaching a class about Abraham Lincoln at Columbia University several years ago and having a student challenge his regard for the Gettysburg Address. The young Black woman wondered how he could expect her to share his respect for a Civil War speech that never mentioned slavery. “That’s a really hard question,” Mr. Delbanco says.<br />He recalls answering her by first noting that Lincoln’s contempt for slavery was implied by his call for “a new birth of freedom.” He then explained that Lincoln was trying to rally the public behind the war before an election against a rival who was pushing peace, and “slavery wasn’t top of mind” for most Northerners. But the moment highlighted important contrasts in the experience of American history in the classroom. “She was listening and I think learning through our conversation, but so was I,” says Mr. Delbanco, 68.<br />Mr. Delbanco, the Alexander Hamilton Professor of American Studies at Columbia, describes teaching as a moral activity. “I have this old-fashioned view that the classroom experience can actually give young people a better self-understanding and a greater awareness of the world around them,” he says. When students read great texts together, whether they are wrestling with the difference between love and desire in Shakespeare or considering Hannah Arendt’s analysis of totalitarianism, they ultimately learn how to think and listen to competing points of view. This makes them better able to function in a democracy, he says, “which, as we are often reminded of now, is a hard thing to do.”<br />Too many students leave college without these skills, Mr. Delbanco says. As the price of college rises and the job market contracts, young people are wary of pursuits that could delay paying off their debts. In search of marketable degrees, many are neglecting the humanities. To study philosophy or English literature in 2020 is basically conspicuous consumption.<br />Mr. Delbanco thinks that he has a solution. As president of the Teagle Foundation, which supports liberal-arts education, he is working to revive a humanities-based general education on college campuses across the country. Together with the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Teagle Foundation is sponsoring a $7 million grant program over five years to expand access to classroom experiences that reckon with the purpose of life.</td>
