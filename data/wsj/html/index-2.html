      <td>Consumer-price index in November was down 0.5% from a year earlier, led by volatile food prices</td>
      <td>China’s consumer prices dropped for the first time in over a decade in November, though economists say the decrease doesn’t signal faltering demand in the world’s second-largest economy.<br />The fall was driven by volatile food prices, including the continued retreat of pork prices as supply recovers from the ravages of African swine fever. Other economic indicators have shown a continued recovery from Covid-19 shocks.<br />China’s consumer-price index in November was down 0.5% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday, after a 0.5% rise in October. It was the first negative reading since October 2009. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast November’s CPI would come in flat.<br />The statistics bureau said food prices, down 2.0% from a year earlier, weighed heavily on November’s headline CPI. In October, food prices were up 2.2% from a year earlier.<br />Among foods, pork—the main source of protein in the Chinese diet—extended its decline, down 12.5% in November after October’s 2.8% drop.</td>

      <td>Why airlines are actually scheduling more long-haul trips in December despite low passenger demand and Covid-driven entry restrictions</td>
      <td>The lesson is clear: No matter the obstacles, there will always be people (and cargo) who will fly.<br />Airlines have added a number of very long international flights to schedules in December, a sign of resilience and necessity in air travel. Some of the new flights are a result of increased holiday travel and cargo demand in key cities. Many will have small passenger loads—30 or 40 people on a wide-body jet. But with the right cargo load, that’s enough to at least break even on many trips, airlines say.<br />That also could mean nine, 12, even 18 hours in an enclosed space in the middle of the pandemic, a choice many would-be fliers have avoided. Robust ventilation and air filtration in cabins does reduce, but not eliminate, viral transmission risk. Even with the risks, quarantines and restrictions, the increased flying just shows that there will always be people who need to go.<br />“Air service is critical. People want to travel—even with a 14-day quarantine, even with all the testing—and these vital travel lanes are key to having those connections,’’ says Patrick Quayle, vice president of international network and alliances at United.<br />The number of scheduled passenger flights at least 3,400 miles long—New York-London is 3,451 miles—jumped 23% to 32,317 world-wide in December compared with November, according to Cirium, an aviation data company. December schedules still had 70% fewer flights than December 2019, but the number of flights scheduled was three times as many as the May low for long-haul international trips.</td>

The efficacy rate announced by authorities in the U.A.E., where the trials took place, would put the vaccine above the 50% threshold that international scientists deem necessary to protect people. Candidates developed by Moderna Inc. and jointly by  Pfizer Inc.  and BioNTech SE have shown to have efficacy rates of 94.5% and 95% in the final stages of testing, respectively.<br />The U.A.E. Health Ministry didn’t disclose how many trial participants developed Covid-19 and how many of those received a placebo or a vaccine. It also wasn’t known whether the data was peer reviewed.<br />The results were the first from Phase 3 trials of a Chinese Covid-19 vaccine. Nearly one million Chinese people have already received the shot, which was developed by state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm, after the government granted emergency-use authorization for it in July.<br />Public-health experts said that the headline figure suggested that the world had another working vaccine option, although more details were needed. Some questioned why Sinopharm hadn’t jointly presented the results.</td>

In several other cases, the campaign or allies withdrew claims after filing them.<br />On Tuesday, the Supreme Court in a one-sentence order turned away a last-ditch effort by Pennsylvania Republicans to invalidate votes from the state’s vote-by-mail system enacted by the state legislature last year. No justice noted a dissent to the order, which was released on the deadline for states to complete election results before the Electoral College meets and casts its vote on Dec. 14.<br />Trump campaign lawyers promised to push forward. “The only fixed day in the U.S. Constitution is the inauguration of the president on January 20,” the Trump campaign’s legal team said.<br />In some of the cases, judges criticized Republicans for making sweeping allegations of voting irregularities and fraud without any proof. In others, courts said they raised relatively minor claims but sought unprecedented action, such as the rejection of millions of votes.</td>

But his delayed arrival is only the beginning of this showdown in a league that has become accustomed to the best players getting their way.<br />Harden’s extraordinary gambit to pressure the Rockets into trading their franchise player to a title contender is the NBA’s latest saga pitting a disgruntled star against his own team.<br />There was hope in Houston that Harden would reconsider his request and avoid this kind of impasse. That optimism made way for resignation and frustration as fresh clips of his extracurricular activities surfaced. Houston’s new coach Stephen Silas has been patient but said that not having his best player at camp was an unexpected setback. When he was asked if he had spoken with Harden, P.J.

      <td>When oil prices went negative during coronavirus lockdowns, the trading giant had its busiest month ever</td>
      <td>Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd., one of the world’s largest commodities traders, posted a record profit Wednesday, making it a big winner from turmoil in crude-oil markets during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The closely held company, which is based in Singapore but run from Geneva, almost doubled its net profit to $1.6 billion in the fiscal year ended September. The company’s operating earnings were the best in its 27-year history, it said.<br />Trafigura’s record windfall highlights the ability of commodity traders to thrive when prices gyrate. Like rivals Vitol Group and Gunvor Group, the company looks to profit whether commodity prices go up or down. Rather than owning mines and wells, it focuses on physical trading of commodities, arbitraging prices for the likes of crude or copper in different parts of the globe.<br />Trafigura did particularly well when oil prices went negative in the spring, despite a concurrent pullback in financing from banks for commodities deals. Demand for crude in cars and planes plummeted with much of the world economy in lockdown, while Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the world’s biggest crude producers, launched a crushing price war.<br />“We had our busiest period in April—our busiest month ever,” said Trafigura Chief Executive Jeremy Weir in a video that accompanied the company’s earnings release. “It was a stunning year,” he said, adding that the company boosted its gross profit margins to 5% from 1.6% last year. While not publicly listed, Trafigura posts financial results for bondholders.</td>

At first loosely regulated, they were seen as a financial innovation serving parts of the Chinese financial system that were ignored by state-backed banks. But a wave of scandals and defaults in 2018 prompted authorities to crack down.<br />At one point, China had more than 5,000 peer-to-peer lenders in operation, said Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and annual transaction volume totaling the equivalent of about $459 billion.<br />“While they were originally positioned as financial-information intermediaries, the vast majority of them have in fact carried out credit and wealth-management business,” he said Tuesday at the Singapore Fintech Festival.<br />However, Mr. Guo added: “We have continued to clean up and consolidate, and by mid-November the actual operating P2P lenders had all been zeroed out.” As of June, previous official statistics showed 29 were still operating.</td>

It meets regularly to review flu vaccines and occasionally on experimental vaccines.<br />On Thursday, 23 members of that committee will evaluate the first among what public health experts say eventually could be a suite of vaccines to help turn the tide of the global coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 1.5 million people world-wide, according to Johns Hopkins University.<br />The advisory panel will play a key role in the FDA’s review. Its members include infectious-disease experts, professors and practicing physicians, as well as a lawyer and some doctors from the Department of Health and Human Services.

They also urged Rio Tinto and its western Australian peers to end the use of gag clauses in land-use agreements that have stopped Aboriginal groups from speaking out against mining operations.<br />The inquiry has the potential to reboot the relationship between indigenous communities and miners, which rank among Australia’s biggest companies.<br />Globally, many mining operations are on land traditionally owned by indigenous groups, including in South America, Africa and the Arctic Circle. While environmental, social and governance standards have become increasingly important for investors in recent years, much of the focus has been on tackling emissions or curbing environmental disasters after waste-dam collapses.</td>

It was just a generation ago—until 1974—when banks were allowed to deny women credit such as credit cards or mortgages in their own names and based on their own financial wherewithal.<br />We’ve come a long way in those 40-odd years, but not nearly far enough. Study after study shows that women aren’t engaging enough with their finances. The financial-services industry is still falling short in serving this half of the population. Women, who often need more money in retirement to cover health and caretaking issues during their longer life spans, are, on average, far behind men in terms of savings. Financial empowerment gets lost in the daily chaos of living.<br />A few small steps can get you back on track. “Think of it as being the CEO of your own home,” says UBS financial advisor Tracy Byrnes. “You don’t need to know where the Dow closed, but you do need to know the big picture.”<br />Below, some of the best analysis and insight from WSJ writers and columnists, the Dow Jones Newswires team and occasionally beyond, on investing, the wealth-management business and more.<br />CORONAVIRUS OUTLOOK</td>

      <td>Move would give Japan pre-emptive strike capability, but Tokyo avoids explicit threats against Pyongyang</td>
      <td>TOKYO—Japan plans to develop its own missiles capable of reaching North Korea, part of a defense buildup that would give Tokyo the ability to strike if it anticipates an attack.<br />Lawmakers in Japan’s ruling party approved the missile proposal on Wednesday, and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said the military wants to strengthen weapons systems that give Japan strike capability from beyond the reach of its opponents.<br />Japan has been reviewing its defenses against Pyongyang, which is rapidly developing its own missile program including intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of hitting the U.S. Dealing with North Korea is likely to be a top challenge for President-elect Joe Biden, who has said he won’t meet leader Kim Jong Un on the same terms President Trump did.<br />While Mr. Trump largely focused on threats to the U.S. homeland, Japan is worried about shorter-range North Korean missiles, which Pyongyang frequently tested over Japanese territory before an informal moratorium prompted by a series of Trump-Kim summit meetings.<br />Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose lengthy term in power was marked by a military buildup focused on China and North Korea, made missile defense the subject of his final act in office. Just before handing the reins in September to Yoshihide Suga, Mr. Abe said Tokyo would come up with a plan by the end of the year.</td>

      <td></td>
      <td>Federal Reserve officials have been hesitant to give credence to market speculation that they will boost the stimulus they are giving to the economy via changes in their bond-buying program, as many of them have said renewed fiscal aid is what the economy really needs. Some Fed officials also have said they see no need now to change the central bank’s support for the economy. With the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee preparing to meet Dec. 15-16, here is a sampling of what Fed officials have said since their last gathering in November.<br /><br />“We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible on behalf of communities, families and businesses across the country.”<br />“We’re buying a lot of Treasurys, we’re buying $80 billion a month, that’s comparable to the pace of QE2…These are big programs, the mortgage program is also quite, quite substantial.”<br />No comments on monetary policy</td>

      <td>Pension managers face hard choice of taking on increased risk or seeking more money from employers and workers</td>
      <td>America’s pension managers are facing a tough choice nine months into the Covid-19 pandemic: take on more risk, or ask for more money from employers and workers.<br />Pensions and other retirement-benefit programs have struggled for years to figure out how to close the gap between the assets they have on hand and the cost of benefits they have promised to pay out in future decades. Their concerns continued to grow as investment returns fell.<br />The pandemic is adding urgency to that long-term problem. While the S&P 500 index has surged 15% this year, analysts are projecting weaker long-term stock-market performance than expected at the end of 2019. Bond rates are expected to remain low in the wake of federal stimulus measures, meaning that fixed-income portfolios, traditionally the bread and butter of pension funds, will return little. Together, those factors are pushing retirement-fund managers across the country to take action to keep shortfalls from growing.<br />“What rate can I expect a dollar of my investment to grow? That’s more challenging now,” said Steve Foresti, chief investment officer at Wilshire Consulting, an adviser to many large pension funds.<br />In September, Wilshire lowered its 10-year annual return projection to 5.5% for U.S. stocks from 5.75% at the end of last year. The projection for long-term core bonds, the bread and butter of old-age savings, fell to 1.75% from 3.25%. Even projections for some alternative assets dropped, with private equity dropping to 7.45% from 7.95% and real assets declining to 5.35% from 5.9%.</td>

Job growth slowed markedly in November from the month before, the Labor Department reported Friday. Employers added 245,000 jobs last month, down from 610,000 in October, the Labor Department said.<br />One measure of hiring—the share of LinkedIn members who added a new employer to their profiles, indexed to the monthly average in 2015-2016—rose 0.8% in November, compared with October. The index jumped 18.1% from September to October.<br />“I’m worried about a temporary stall or backslide as we move into December and January,” said Guy Berger, LinkedIn’s principal economist. He cited a “triple whammy” of factors weighing on the labor market: fading fiscal support for households, spiraling coronavirus cases, and new restrictions on business and households to control the spread of infection.</td>

      <td>Videogame maker  CD Projekt SA  was finishing its biggest-ever title, anchored by Hollywood star Keanu Reeves, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit earlier this year and bogged the Polish company down with time-eating remote-work problems.<br />On Thursday, “Cyberpunk 2077” will finally hit the market after three delays that have both fed fan anticipation and changed the calculus for its success because of the project’s higher costs. The struggles of the Warsaw-based company reflect the challenges of managing creative teams remotely as well as the difficulties a smaller player confronts trying to create a blockbuster in the competitive, fast-growing videogame market.<br />CD Projekt could use a big hit. The company has only one other major game franchise, and all eyes are on “Cyberpunk” because it is the industry’s only original major title coming to market this holiday season.<br />Executives at CD Projekt said the cost of making and marketing “Cyberpunk” was significantly higher than the roughly $80 million the company spent on its last game, “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,” without providing specifics. They said they initially miscalculated how long “Cyberpunk” would take to complete, with the health crisis most affecting the latter stages of four years of development, following pre-production work that started around 2012.<br />With employees homebound, making even a minor tweak—such as changing the placement of characters or objects in a scene—would take hours instead of minutes, said Marcin Iwiński, who co-founded CD Projekt with a high-school friend in the early 1990s and is now co-chief executive with Adam Kiciński. “There’s less iteration and communication on a daily basis,” he said.</td>

Within 24 hours, 6.4 million doses are set to be sent to every state and the District of Columbia. For most, that initial shipment will be enough to inoculate a little under 1% of their populations.<br />Most states are giving the initial batch to doctors, nurses and other health-care workers who interact with infected patients. As more doses are shipped, many said they would give priority to residents of long-term-care facilities next. The bulk of the population is expected to get the vaccine in the spring or summer, officials have said.<br />But state vaccination plans vary widely and leave many questions unanswered. Health officials are having to prioritize among competing groups including older adults, teachers and minority communities disproportionately affected by Covid-19. Many states also face challenges getting the vaccine to dramatically different populations, from crowded and diverse cities to isolated rural towns.<br />And they have to do it while coping with a surge in coronavirus cases already straining resources in many parts of the nation.</td>

      <td>Currency is near its highest level against the dollar in more than two years; investors worry there is little that the ECB can do to rein it in</td>
      <td>The dollar’s weakness is complicating matters for both policy makers and investors in Europe.<br />Bets that Covid-19 vaccines will propel the global economic recovery next year have prompted investors to buy assets outside the U.S., pushing the dollar lower in recent weeks. That has left the euro up more than 8% against the greenback this year, and near its highest level since April 2018. It traded Wednesday at about $1.2135 apiece.<br />The rally in the common currency threatens to impede European policy makers’ efforts to stoke inflation in the region. A stronger euro makes exports from the region less competitive overseas, potentially curbing economic growth. It would also make imports less expensive for the eurozone, and damp inflation.<br />Such concerns are eroding investors’ appetite for eurozone stocks. The Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark for the region, has dropped more than 5% since the end of last year. That compares with the S&P 500 index’s almost 15% gain.<br />The region’s pace of economic growth “is okay, but not enough to put any upward pressure on inflation,” said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for core investments at AXA Investment Managers. “It’s not a time for big asset-allocation decisions in Europe.”</td>

      <td>Even after the pandemic has passed in Europe and the U.S., luxury brands expect to do a lot more business in Asia. Their next job is to reduce the burden of emptier shops in cities like Paris and Milan.<br />From January through October this year, designer labels opened more boutiques in Asia than any other region, according to data from  Savills .  It is the first time that Europe, normally the most popular location for new stores, has been outpaced in the real-estate firm’s records. North America’s share of global openings halved compared with 2019 levels.<br />Much of the activity happened in mainland China, where demand for luxury goods has recovered rapidly after lockdowns early in the year. Of all the stores opened around the world so far in 2020, 19% were in Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen—far higher than their 6% average share of global openings over the past three years.<br />The trend has been exaggerated by the coronavirus, which has emptied Western cities of tourists, but is expected to outlive it. Even after long-haul travel returns to normal, Chinese consumers—by far the industry’s biggest spenders—will likely shop more at home.<br />Before the crisis, they made 70% of their luxury purchases overseas, mainly in European cities like London and Paris. But the Chinese government looks determined to keep that money at home. This summer, Beijing tripled consumers’ duty-free allowance and opened domestic duty-free stores where the quota can be spent up to six months after a trip.</td>

      <td>An aging population may finally force the government to face long-needed reform challenges head on</td>
      <td>China is getting older. That means the Chinese people will have to work longer. But deeper reforms will also be necessary to ensure income growth doesn’t stagnate.<br />The world’s most populous country has begun aging rapidly over the past decade, but the pace is going to pick up even more as tens of millions reach retirement age. The working population—people between the ages of 15 and 59—will drop by 65 million, or 5.5% of the total, in the next 10 years, according to United Nations projections. A graying population is a common problem in most developed countries but due to China’s one-child policy, which lasted for more than 30 years, its population will age quicker and at lower income levels than in many other countries. The problem looks even more unavoidable as China takes in only minimal numbers of immigrants.<br />That’s why Beijing floated the idea of raising the retirement age in the outline of its next five-year economic plan released last month. There are no concrete details yet, but the idea has already received angry pushback online, especially from people who are about to retire.<br />But postponing the retirement age will be inevitable. China’s retirement age—60 for men and 55 for women for civil servants and white-collar workers—is low compared with other countries. Lifting that to 65 could delay the aging problem by a decade or so. The 60 to 64 cohort is going to make up around 8% of China’s population in 2030, according to the U.N.<br />Even so, the elderly population of 65 or above will still double in the next 15 years. That means slower growth and that the government will have to shoulder a bigger burden to take care of its senior citizens, all while Chinese average incomes remain far below aging developed countries including the U.S. or South Korea.</td>

They have upgraded air filters, lowered capacity, required preboarding Covid-19 tests and enforced physical distancing.<br />But the virus still found its way on board.<br />A cruise ship operated by  Royal Caribbean  International returned to port in Singapore on Wednesday after an 83-year-old passenger tested positive. All of the passenger’s close contacts were isolated and have since tested negative, according to the Singapore Tourism Board. The remaining guests have been instructed to stay in their rooms until they get the all-clear, and meals are being sent directly to the rooms.<br />Royal Caribbean was one of two operators recently allowed to resume sailing from Singapore under safety protocols developed in collaboration with the city-state’s tourism authorities. Its ship, Quantum of the Seas, was forced to cut its trip short after the passenger complained of diarrhea and later tested positive.<br />All passengers will be allowed to disembark after a review of contact tracing is complete and will be tested before leaving the terminal, authorities said. “That we were able to quickly identify this single case and take immediate action is a sign that the system is working as it was designed to do,” the company said.</td>

The private-equity firm, which specializes in retail and consumer investments, had agreed last month to a purchase price of $540 million, subject to certain adjustments, the assumption of some liabilities and other terms.<br />“This is a pretty marvelous transaction and I just wanted to applaud all of you for putting this together and getting this done,” Judge Huennekens said during a hearing Tuesday held by phone and video.<br />The deal, which could close by next week, will preserve the business as a going concern with at least 900 stores. As of late August, Ascena operated 1,500 retail locations throughout the U.S., down from its previous roughly 2,800 stores.<br />“The business will be owned by a sophisticated retail investor with a track record of maximizing value in this space, where others have found it challenging,” said Steven Serajeddini, a lawyer representing Ascena, during the hearing. “We are very thrilled with the result.”</td>

Recall Congress created the GSEs to guarantee mortgages with the purpose of increasing liquidity to the housing market. Their implicit government backstop allowed them to expand their footprints and leverage, which yielded enormous profits.<br />When the housing bubble burst, Fannie and Freddie were stuck with enormous losses on toxic mortgages. At that point they should have been placed in receivership. But the Bush Treasury opted for conservatorship under regulatory control by the FHFA.<br />With a $190 billion injection from Treasury, they gained a new lease on life. In return, Treasury received preferred senior stock, which the giants were supposed to pay a 10% dividend on liquidation preference, and warrants to acquire 79.9% of common shares. The GSEs were also supposed to pay a fee for the government’s open-ended credit.<br />Because they were unable to pay the required dividend or fee, Treasury in 2012 began sweeping their net earnings. Fan and Fred shareholders on Wall Street argue that the government has unfairly appropriated hundreds of billions of dollars in profits. But Treasury still hasn’t come close to being repaid what it was originally owed under the 2008 agreement for rescuing the giants.</td>

      <td>President Trump deserves credit for rebuilding America’s armed forces, so it’s a pity his parting shot is a veto spectacle over a defense policy bill. Mr. Trump won’t extract what he wants but he might harm some of his own priorities with friendly fire.<br />Congress this week is voting on the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, which sets policy outlines for the military and national security. This year’s iteration includes several good provisions toughening U.S. China policy. One establishes a Pacific Deterrence Initiative that authorizes $2.2 billion for, among other things, putting more military assets in China’s backyard and conducting exercises with allies.<br />The bill also authorizes programs for overhauling an aging nuclear deterrent, a Trump priority. “We cannot overemphasize the immediate need to modernize our nuclear delivery systems and stockpile,” civilian and uniformed defense officials told the Senate in testimony in September. They warned that “decades of deferred investments in nuclear warheads” and surrounding infrastructure has stretched systems “well beyond their original service lives.”<br />Not all of the bill is worth passing, and a veto threat from President Trump wouldn’t have been a kamikaze run if it were over more investment in hypersonic missiles or more ships. But Mr. Trump has taken the defense bill hostage in his crusade against social-media companies, saying that he won’t sign it unless it includes a repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.<br />Section 230 might deserve some limits given how broadly courts have interpreted its liability protections, as Justice Clarence Thomas recently argued. But eliminating it could have major economic consequences that Congress might later regret, and this shouldn’t be rushed through with only token debate.</td>

Less defensible is his failure to anticipate the full withdrawal that Barack Obama ordered and prepare adequately, which led to a hasty exit. Mr. Biden, who worked with Gen. Austin during the Obama Administration, might be most attracted to him as a loyal lieutenant.<br />Gen. Austin was promoted to Commander of U.S. Central Command (Centcom) in 2013 and held the job for three years as Islamic State rampaged across Iraq and Syria. His role in the failed program to train Syrian rebels deserves attention, as does the military’s apparent surprise at the fall of Mosul and swift rise of ISIS in 2014. His spokesman denied it, but Gen. Austin reportedly told the White House that ISIS was only “a flash in the pan.”<br />Blame for the Middle Eastern failures of these years sits primarily with Mr. Obama and his team, including Mr. Biden. But Gen. Austin’s role warrants more scrutiny during confirmation hearings. As a general, he was known for his reticence in command circles. We worry whether Gen. Austin (and the Pentagon) would be sidelined in policy debates among the Biden confidants who will run the National Security Council and State Department.<br />Another concern is that Gen. Austin’s experience is fighting land wars in the Middle East while the growing threat is a sea conflict with China. GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher has it right that Gen. Austin is “a patriot” but “not the pick if you believe China is an urgent threat.” Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley recently predicted “a lot of bloodletting” in the Pentagon to fund a more prepared Navy, but that will take political will from a defense chief.</td>

      <td>The combat pilot who broke the sound barrier with two broken ribs.</td>
      <td>There aren’t many giants in American life, and on Monday we lost another. Chuck Yeager, the first man to travel faster than the speed of sound, died in his home at the age of 97.<br />In 1947, Yeager, a young Air Force pilot from the little town of Hamlin, W.Va., was chosen to fly a rocket-propelled plane, the Bell XS-1, on a supersonic flight over the Mojave Desert. On October 14 he flew the plane, which he named Glamorous Glennis after his wife, at a speed of Mach 1.06—700 miles per hour. The night before he had broken two ribs by falling off a horse, and he could barely reach up to seal the hatch, but only his wife and a close friend knew about it.<br />In a 1985 memoir, Yeager famously expressed his sense of disappointment at crossing the threshold of sound and creating the world’s first sonic boom. “And that was it,” he wrote. “After all the anticipation to achieve this moment, it really was a let-down.”<br />But by then he had defied death more often than anybody knew. As a pilot in World War II, Yeager shot down at least 13 enemy fighters. He once downed five German aircraft in a single day. Yeager was shot down himself over France, but made it across the Pyrenees and into Spain, sometimes disguised as a peasant and carrying a wounded companion. When the war ended, Captain Yeager was 22.<br />He led missions in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, too, and spent a well-earned retirement giving speeches and conducting himself with decency and honor. Chuck Yeager was an American of an older, rarer kind: ready to take a risk for his country, courageous beyond measure, utterly without pretense.</td>

      <td>Paying people to get the Covid-19 shot may be the way to overcome skepticism about the vaccine.</td>
      <td>How much would the government have to pay you to take the Covid-19 vaccine?<br />For most of us, it’s a silly question. Recent polls show that around 60% of Americans plan to get vaccinated as soon as possible and need no monetary incentive to do so. The problem is that a 60% vaccination rate may not do the trick. Dr. Anthony Fauci said this week that to keep the virus from finding new hosts, social distancing should continue until 75% to 80% of the population is vaccinated.<br />With several vaccines on the verge of being approved, talk has understandably turned to distribution. Who should be at the head of the line, health-care workers or elderly residents of long-term-care facilities? Do we give it first to the people most likely to die from Covid or to the people most likely to spread it? At some point, these questions will have to be addressed, but they are all secondary to whether we can get enough people vaccinated.<br />At this point, we still don’t even know how well the vaccines will work. We know how they fared in clinical trials, but previous vaccines have proven to be less effective outside clinical settings. People who enroll in clinical trials tend, among other things, to be healthier than the public at large and easier for doctors to observe. But assuming that the vaccines are effective, how do you convince enough people to get inoculated at a time when public trust in government institutions is at historic lows?<br />One way to go is using carrots instead of sticks. Telling people they can’t fly or send their kids to school may work in some cases, but there’s evidence that paying people to get vaccinated might be more effective. In a typical year, less than half of American adults bother to get flu shots. But a 2015 study conducted by economists at Swarthmore College found that offering people a $30 reward was enough to increase vaccination rates by 12 percentage points.</td>

      <td>The next version of the Paycheck Protection Program should focus on helping smaller firms.</td>
      <td>With the coronavirus surging and colder weather limiting outdoor activities, the economy needs another round of fiscal policy support. Aid to small businesses should be part of any federal package, but it should be structured somewhat differently than the original Paycheck Protection Program.<br />Yes, the economy added 245,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate fell to 6.7%. But the pace of job gains is notably slower than the 2.7 million net new jobs added in May and the 4.8 million added in June. Consumer spending is slowing, and consumer confidence is weakening. The household savings rate has plummeted since April, as consumers burn through savings. After a remarkable recovery this spring, a double-dip recession is in the cards.<br />That recovery was aided by PPP, created as part of the Cares Act to provide forgivable loans—essentially grants to finance operating costs—to businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Our research shows that PPP supported employment and increased financial health in the small-business sector. In addition, PPP supported labor demand and is reducing the length of the recovery by helping small businesses—the potential employers of any unemployed workers—to survive over the spring, summer and fall.<br />At this point, though, many small businesses are running on fumes. The next round of PPP should make four changes from its original structure:<br />• Focus on smaller firms. Our research suggests they are the most responsive and likely most in need. A 300-employee cap seems reasonable.</td>

      <td>The Bronx, N.Y.<br />The Supreme Court smacked down Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s arbitrary limits on church attendance in certain Covid hot spots late last month. The decision was a welcome reprieve for religious leaders, who have for the most part bent over backward to accommodate pandemic restrictions imposed by civil authorities. But enough is enough. America’s churches should reopen fully, and they should do it now.<br />Anyone who thought the high court’s 5-4 ruling would end government attempts to squeeze the right to free exercise of religion was wrong. Mr. Cuomo dismissed the decision as “irrelevant” and “political.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom has imposed a 10 p.m. curfew, which would seem to place midnight Mass in the category of a criminal conspiracy.<br />They canceled Easter. Is Christmas next?<br />At my Catholic parish in the North Bronx, the requisite masking is in effect, hand sanitizer is everywhere, and the old regulars are social distancing in the pews. What’s missing are the children. Our parish is healthy. We have a dynamic pastor, several faithful priests, and a vibrant neighborhood loaded with kids and families. During normal times, the 10:30 a.m. Sunday Mass would feature a children’s choir and a corps of young altar servers. It would be held in the auditorium of the parish high school next door, to accommodate a bulging congregation of mothers with strollers and fidgety tweens in soccer uniforms.</td>

      <td>My mother, Myrna Nielson Thacker, got polio just after Thanksgiving 1951, when she was 14. She had spent the long weekend with family in Salt Lake City. On returning home 50 miles south in Spanish Fork, she experienced a fever, numbness and stiffness in her feet and legs, and excruciating pain in her back. Within a few days, she was paralyzed from the waist down.<br />Polio was the pandemic of the early 1950s. As with the coronavirus, many of those infected had little or no symptoms. But for about 1% of infections it entered the central nervous system, and in 1 of 1,000 cases it progressed to paralysis. Flulike symptoms created fear that you had a potentially deadly virus. Then as now, everyone was learning in real time. Doctors, nurses, therapists and scientists worked to find treatments while waiting for a vaccine.<br />After my mother was diagnosed by a Spanish Fork doctor, her parents took her to Salt Lake City. When a policeman pulled them over for speeding, my grandfather explained the situation. The officer escorted them the rest of the way to the hospital.<br />Temporary polio isolation units, like those we’ve seen erected in some coronavirus hot spots, were common. She was admitted to the Salt Lake County Hospital’s polio isolation ward, where she had to dispose of all her belongings and any visits were severely restricted.<br />For a young teenager, the isolation and paralysis were overwhelming. She wrote that she could hardly sleep at night. But she noticed a light bulb in the hallway, which became a comfort to her and “taught me how important light is in lifting our spirits. It gave me something to focus on instead of the pain.”</td>

      <td>A gimlet-eyed chronicle of a glamorous and tumultuous life in journalism that spares no one, least of all the author herself.</td>
      <td>Barbara Amiel is the wife of Conrad Black, the newspaper tycoon who was convicted of fraud and went to prison in 2008. Now, a year and a half after his pardon from President Donald Trump, comes her memoir, a tome nearly 600 pages long. When it comes to those who have crossed her, the word “pardon” is not in her lexicon.<br />Ms. Amiel leaves no score unsettled in this waspish, often scandalous, gossipy, vengeful, intimate chronicle of her tumultuous life (there’s even a “friends and enemies” list at the end). It’s also disarmingly frank, funny and very well written.<br />Lord Black of Crossharbour (his full title when he was made a life peer in 2001) was chairman of Hollinger International, the media company that owned, among other publications, the Daily Telegraph and the Chicago Sun-Times. After their marriage in 1992, the Blacks led a life of extraordinary opulence: Lincoln Center galas, A-list parties, two private jets, mansions in Kensington and Palm Beach, an apartment on Park Avenue and a house in Toronto. Then, in 2003, things started to unravel as investigations began into Lord Black’s financial dealings.<br />Ms. Amiel, who is now 80, was no stranger to adversity. She had a difficult childhood, growing up during the Blitz in Hendon, a suburb of London, and encountering anti-Semitism at an early age. Her parents divorced when she was 8. Three years later, her stepfather moved the family to Hamilton, a steel town in Ontario. Her mother made frequent attempts to kill herself. When Ms. Amiel was 14 she left home, continuing high school while living in rented rooms. Her natural father committed suicide. She started using codeine, a morphine derivative. “After taking the tablets my spirits got a hit of euphoria . . . All I needed then were an occasional couple of pills. All I need now are a couple or at max three or four a day.” She swallows them with a cocktail of Carnation evaporated milk and Ribena, the blackcurrant drink given to British children. Where on earth did she come up with that concoction? She doesn’t say.<br />Before she became Lady Black, Ms. Amiel had a hugely successful career in journalism. In 1983 she became the first woman editor of a daily Canadian newspaper, the Toronto Sun. She married three times and moved to London, where, in 1986, she became an outspoken conservative columnist for the Times. After 9 years, she went to the Daily Telegraph. She was beautiful, addicted to “raiment,” and had a succession of lovers, including a toy boy “so physically perfect a specimen that you really wanted to put him nude on the mantelpiece.” She declares: “The perception of me was that of a cool seductress, rippling and swirling through life. And perhaps when you so describe yourself in spite of yourself, some of the cheaper characteristics do rub off on you.”</td>

Security Council resolutions, including by taking action against companies, individuals, and vessels that engage in prohibited trade.

Nasdaq is not asking the SEC to “impose a quota system,” nor are we “mandating” the composition of boards.<br />Our duty is, as your editorial says, and our proposal to the SEC outlines, to provide “transparency for shareholders.”<br />Our proposal does precisely that: Nasdaq listed companies should disclose the diversity of their boards. We propose that companies have at least two diverse directors: one who self-identifies as female, and one who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+. Companies would be given time to meet this objective. Those who can’t, or don’t believe it’s appropriate, have the option to explain why. Our proposal preserves each company’s decision-making authority over its board while advancing an important dialogue among its shareholders.<br />Investors increasingly care about diversity and governance, as evidenced by the surge in net asset flows into ESG-focused strategies from $4 billion in 2016 to $40 billion in 2020. Our disclosure-based proposal provides investors with greater transparency about board composition. This only serves to enhance investor confidence in the director selection process.<br />Nasdaq is required by the SEC to protect investors and promote the public interest. While capitalism has shown that it can improve the lives of billions, trust and support for the markets will only be maintained if its workings and results are shared by all of society. We hope our proposal, which aims to increase transparency about diversity in corporate America, can be part of the solution.</td>

During my freshman year in high school, my dad moved into an apartment in Muncie, Ind.<br />For much of the last five years of his life, he felt the pain and endured the challenges of being separated from his family. So much in the stories of these GM workers who left their families behind when the factory in Lordstown, Ohio, shut down—such as rooming with a workmate, taking a lot of overtime and coming home only on weekends—my dad experienced as well. His sacrifice kept an awkward and shy 13-year-old boy from being uprooted from his friends and the only home he had ever known.<br />At the time, I realized the benefit to myself. However, it was only in retrospect that I appreciated the high cost that my dad paid to provide for his family with the least disruption to our lives. I thank my dad, John Mullaly, for his sacrifice. I would also like to tell the GM workers that though Lordstown no longer makes cars, from what I read, it still makes great fathers and husbands.<br />Timothy Mullaly<br />Memphis, Tenn.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Dozens of Republican members of Congress lined up behind President Trump after he again threatened to veto a bipartisan $740.5 billion defense-policy bill, with a House vote later Tuesday set to provide a key test of his influence with GOP lawmakers.<br />“I hope House Republicans will vote against the very weak National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which I will VETO,” Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday. The bill, which secures pay rates for troops and other crucial military spending items, has passed on a bipartisan basis for 59 years in a row.<br />The president said Congress must jettison a provision in the annual bill that would create a commission to rename military installations, monuments and paraphernalia honoring Confederate commanders, as well as include language to terminate Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which grants social-media companies broad immunity for the content they publish from users on their site.<br />Mr. Trump also added two demands he hadn’t made earlier, saying the bill must “allow for 5G & troupe reductions in foreign lands!”<br />While Republicans and Democrats in Congress have indicated in recent days that they intend to pass the bill over Mr. Trump’s objections, the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the chamber’s most conservative lawmakers, said Tuesday they would oppose the NDAA and support Mr. Trump’s veto.</td>

The headphones, which go on sale today and begin shipping next week, are coming a little more than a year after Apple introduced a high-end version of its AirPods wireless earbuds. AirPods are now one of Apple’s most successful new products.<br />The Cupertino, Calif., company also said it plans next week to begin selling a subscription fitness service around its Apple Watch costing $10 a month or $80 a year. The announcement puts Apple in steeper competition with  Peloton Interactive Inc.,  which in addition to its fitness equipment has invested in its digital platform that offers subscriptions to workout classes and more.<br />In recent years, Apple has been looking to broaden its offering of wearable products and services through them amid slowing iPhone sales, though the company has recently benefited from an uptick in demand for its laptops, iPads and digital services due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Apple’s over-the-ear headphone offerings for years had been centered on its Beats products.

      <td><br /><br /><br />Why go to an art museum? Yes, you can usually get a good lunch there, but this isn’t a trick question: You go there to look at great art, delight in it and learn more about it. Very few of us will ever own a Manet or a Mark Rothko, but you can see examples of their work hanging in American museums from coast to coast, an experience that is nothing like looking at a reproduction in a coffee-table book. Or, at least, you could see them: The Covid-19 pandemic has forced many major art museums to close or sharply limit their viewing capacity, and many art lovers are now understandably reluctant to visit those museums that remain open.<br />How, then, can people who love art continue to enrich their aesthetic lives in something like the manner to which they’re accustomed? New York’s Museum of Modern Art has a very good answer. “Virtual Views: Van Gogh’s ‘Starry Night’” is an online “exhibition” devoted to one of MoMA’s most familiar and best-loved paintings. It includes an introductory video and a Q&A session with Ann Temkin, the museum’s chief curator of painting and sculpture, followed by a “performative reading” by the actor-playwright Anna Deavere Smith of the correspondence between Vincent van Gogh and his brother Theo. The package also includes several other choice items, including “a cosmologist’s take on the painting’s famous sky.”</td>

But he also took aim at the way the Justice Department had tried to dismiss the case in May, suggesting that but for the pardon, he may have denied their bid and either forced Mr. Flynn to go to trial or to jail.<br />Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “Dismissal is, of course, the correct result.”<br />Sidney Powell, a lawyer who represents Mr. Flynn, accused Judge Sullivan of bias.

It is known as the “Safe Harbor” deadline because, if met, Congress should accept a state’s results as conclusive and reject any further challenges, according to federal law.<br />The deadline usually passes with little notice. This year, the Trump campaign and its allies have so far unsuccessfully launched a battery of lawsuits and sought to persuade some state legislatures to overturn the election results, drawing extra attention to the arcane formalities that states and Congress take to confirm the next president in time for the inauguration on Jan. 20.<br />The “Safe Harbor” deadline doesn’t necessarily end those or other lawsuits. But given that Congress is supposed to respect the results of states that meet the deadline, and with the Electoral College vote coming Monday, it narrows the options for challenging the outcome, according to election law scholars.<br />“I don’t think it’s the kind of the deadline that’s going to bring true finality,” said Richard L. Hasen, an election-law professor at the University of California, Irvine. “It’s more like another nail in the coffin.”</td>

      <td>A Netflix series offers gripping documentary portraits of four remarkable doctors.</td>
      <td>As unlikely as it sounds, “The Surgeon’s Cut” is really about artists. Their métier may be on the margins of medical science—heart transplants, brain surgery, liver grafting, procedures inside the womb—but their personalities are as large, singular and even eccentric as the most “creative” individuals. They possess the same kind of vision and the same kind of drive. What they manage to do is create miracles. What the program’s four directors create—let’s call it a minor miracle—is something that does justice to their subjects.<br />The astonishments in the four-part production are manifold—the surgeries, of course, but the stories, too. Each doctor’s history, already the outcome of often uncanny happenstance and fortune, contains a wrenching twist in the plotline, a revelation that—coming as it does after every other remarkable thing—doesn’t seem possible. And wouldn’t be, if this were fiction.<br />Documentaries often succeed, rightly or wrongly, on the basis of how sympathetic their characters are. Each of the principals in “The Surgeon’s Cut” could be reciting an actuarial table and still be fascinating, but the things that they do explain, in clean, uncluttered fashion, are almost otherworldly. Kypros Nicolaides, the star of episode 1 (“Saving Life Before Birth,” directed by James Newton), is based at King’s College Hospital in London, where one of his specialties is endoscopic laser surgery on fetuses suffering “twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome”: One twin is getting too little blood, which means it is not developing; the other is getting too much, which means a strain on its heart. What Dr. Nicolaides does—through a lens we get to share—is breathtaking, and nerve-racking and not always 100% successful. But the efforts are, by definition, heroic. Likewise, Dr. Nicolaides.<br />Directed by Lucy Blakstad, episode 2 (“Sacred Brain”) is the most overtly cinematic of the four segments and perhaps the best story: Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., grew up in Mexicali, Mexico, within view of the U.S. border fence; as a kid he practiced climbing over it and at age 19 succeeded, only to be put in a detention center. Later, he became a migrant worker in California, took English classes, went to night school, entered the University of California, Berkeley, and later medical school. “I went from harvest to Harvard in seven years,” he says, in a way that tips us off that he’s used the line before (which only makes it more charming). What he calls the “faraway”—the place he and his friends would talk about as kids—turned out to be the human brain, which Dr. Quiñones-Hinojosa regards as a sacred space, “like the gateway to a magical temple,” and from which he excises the most intractable tumors.<br />The mystical aspect of the doctor’s art, rooted in his mix of Catholicism and indigenous culture, is invoked by Ms. Blakstad in several strikingly artistic moments—the doctor spinning around in the OR, for instance, and becoming a Mexican kid spinning around in an archival film. In another sequence, a truckload of migrant workers in the back of a pickup is being passed up by a camera in a car—a car that the camera then suggests is being driven by Dr. Quiñones-Hinojosa himself.</td>

      <td>Likely to captivate viewers young and old, an animated film roots its fantastical story in the island’s tortured history.</td>
      <td>‘Family entertainment” often means something parents can sit through without clawing the armrest off the couch. But the animated “Wolfwalkers” is a different sort of beast. With its enchanted forests, shape-shifting wood sprites and a plucky heroine named Robyn Goodfellowe, the film is terrific fare for kids. But the underpinnings of its fantastical story lie in tortured Irish history, English imperialism, and the use of religion to rationalize oppression; there’s a hum of yearning for a pre-Christian Hibernia of pagans, Druids and nature worship. Adults will be eager to see where it’s all going to go.<br />Where Robyn goes, early on, is the scullery. “Work is prayer,” she is told by the crone-in-chief—and it’s one of the more frightening moments in a film full of formidable action, near-calamity and wolf-imperilment. The setting is Kilkenny, Ireland, in 1650—the very year that capital of the Irish Catholic Confederacy fell to Oliver Cromwell. His name is never mentioned, but he is embodied in the evil Lord Protector (voice of Simon McBurney), who is on hand to enforce order and quell political dissent. The chief source of that dissent are the wolves who inhabit the surrounding forest, along with the Wolfwalkers—young Mebh, who sounds like a 2020 Dublin tween, and her mother, Moll (voices of Eva Whittaker and Maria Doyle Kennedy). They are human-like but possess wolf avatars that leave their sleeping bodies and roam the troubled countryside.<br />Robyn (voice of Honor Kneafsey) is a recent arrival from England, having come with her Roundhead father, who is the Lord Protector’s chief wolf exterminator. Robyn wants to be a wolf hunter, too, until she comes to understand the injustices being done to the wolves and the land. “What cannot be tamed must be destroyed,” says the Lord Protector, who is prepared to burn down the forest if he can’t control it. Cromwell’s policies in Ireland were genocidal, so the villainy is not misplaced.<br />The intentions of the Will Collins screenplay, and the direction (and art direction) of directors Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, aren’t anti-Christian, per se: As we are told early on, St. Patrick made a deal “with the pagans” to keep the locals close to home and leave the wolves and Wolfwalkers alone; it is the Puritans who are big-footing it around the woods. And the byproducts of worship are certainly celebrated: The visual elements of the animation include the Celtic spirals, interlacing patterns and stained-glass-evoking geometry that are found in the illuminated manuscripts of Dark Ages Ireland. (Mr. Moore also directed 2009’s “The Secret of Kells,” about the Book of Kells, with Nora Twomey, who is a producer here.) The style elsewhere ranges from Monet-like depictions of the wildest Ireland to naive depictions of the village of Kilkenny that suggest perspective-free medieval painting. The Wolfwalkers are aswirl in color and motion; the townsfolk are flat and more cartoonish. But even they seem inspired by the often simple representations of humans rendered by those anonymous illustrators of the monasteries.<br />Among the many clever and understated virtues of “Wolfwalkers” (politics, for instance, are never mentioned) is the way the animals are characterized. The Lord Protector calls the wolves “foul” and “wicked.” In one fulminating moment he says, “By God’s clarity and judgment He vanquishes thee,” though nothing of the sort happens. But there’s no anthropomorphizing by the movie itself: Wolves are wolves, even though the ones here do hang out with very enchanted people.</td>

      <td>U.S. government-bond yields fell Tuesday, driven lower by investors’ concerns about the prospects for Brexit trade negotiations and a U.S. emergency economic relief package.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note finished trading Tuesday at 0.913%, according to Tradeweb. That’s the second-straight session decline and down from 0.928% at Monday’s close. The 30-year yield fell to 1.659%, from 1.687% Monday.<br />Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, retreated Tuesday as investors waited for developments on the Brexit trade negotiations. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that securing a trade deal at a coming summit with the European Union will be difficult before the Dec. 31 deadline. That uncertainty is driving some investors to havens such as U.S. Treasurys.<br />In the U.S., delays on bills covering economic relief and government spending are also pressuring yields, some analysts said. Lawmakers on Monday struggled to resolve stumbling blocks while seeking a deal on the emergency pandemic relief program. Congressional leaders said they plan to pass a one-week extension of government funding legislation to buy more time for negotiations.<br />Those strains have helped reverse a recent rise in Treasury yields, which tend to climb when investors expect economic growth and inflation. The prospect of a vaccine-fueled economic rebound recently helped push 10-year yields to their highest close in nearly a month near 1%, a level not surpassed since before the pandemic.</td>

      <td>New AirPods Max headphones may follow HomePod rather than AirPods trajectory</td>
      <td>Apple Inc.’s  new headphones are at least aptly named.<br />The company announced the AirPods Max on Tuesday morning. Its first Apple-branded entry into the wireless, over-ear headphone market carries an eye-popping price tag of $549—57% higher than the most expensive line of comparable headphones from its own Beats lineup. The new earphones begin shipping next week.<br />Apple has never been one for bargain hunters and its success so far with its AirPods lineup has likely emboldened its approach to the audio market. The company launched the first version in late 2016 for $159—a fair premium to other wireless buds at the time. But the AirPods sound quality and ease-of-use relative to the competition were enough to overcome ridicule about their design. The buds sold strong out of the gate and paved the way for an even more expensive Pro version that launched late last year. Apple credited AirPods as the top driver of growth for its wearables segment, which saw revenue surge 25% to $30.6 billion for the company’s fiscal year that ended in September.<br />But Apple’s premium pricing strategy doesn’t always work out so well. The company’s first HomePod smart speaker launched in early 2018 at $350—more than twice the price of  Amazon ’s  Echo that ruled the smart speaker category at the time. The HomePod sold poorly: Futuresource Consulting estimates it garnered about 4% of smart speaker sales that year. Apple has since cut the HomePod’s price by $50 and launched a much more price-competitive version last month called the HomePod Mini for $99.<br />The new AirPods Max seems more likely to follow the latter’s track. The over-ear headphone market is a fragmented one, with prices ranging from well under $100 to audiophile offerings costing well over $1,000. But the current average selling price for over-ear, wireless headphones with noise canceling is around $230, according to Ben Arnold of NPD Group. And sales in this category have been falling, with revenue down 45% for the first 10 months of this year compared with the same period last year as consumers have been showing a strong preference for wireless buds, according to NPD data.</td>

But they don’t address the underlying vulnerabilities.<br />“The immediate aftermath is a time to focus on the fundamentals,” says Jamil Farshchi, chief information security officer at  Equifax Inc.,  who joined the company five months after the company’s 2017 data breach. Mr. Farshchi had previously led a rehabilitation effort at  Home Depot Inc.  after a 2014 breach.<br />Companies can avoid 99.9% of potential threats that they face if they just enforce a policy of doing the basic things correctly and in a timely fashion, Mr. Farshchi says; things like applying security patches and understanding which devices are authorized to connect to the network.</td>

      <td>Issues have bedeviled efforts to reach a bipartisan deal before the end of the year</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said that Congress should take up a coronavirus relief bill that excludes Republican and Democratic priorities that currently lack bipartisan agreement and instead address those issues in an additional package next year.<br />Mr. McConnell on Tuesday said lawmakers should set aside aid for state and local governments and liability protections, two issues that have bedeviled lawmakers in the year-end effort to pass another aid package. He made the comments  as both parties are eager to strike a deal quickly but struggled to agree on details.<br />Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) rejected Mr. McConnell’s idea and accused him of trying to sabotage talks. He is “trying to pull the rug out from beneath” the negotiators, Mr. Schumer said.<br />In another development, Trump administration officials asked Senate Republicans to press to include $600 direct checks in any relief package, according to people familiar with the discussions. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin advocated for the $600 check, half the size of the first round of checks, while Mr. Trump would be willing to include a larger check, the people said. The current bipartisan framework doesn’t include any such direct payments.<br />Mr. McConnell said that a package this year should focus on money for vaccine distribution, health-care providers and small businesses, pointing to President-elect Joe Biden’s plans to work on another relief package in his administration as another opportunity to work out the outstanding issues.</td>

Chief Executive Elon Musk said he has moved to Texas, taking aim at Silicon Valley and becoming one of the highest-profile executives yet to leave California during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />He said the move made sense with Tesla’s new factory under way in Texas, as he lamented that California had become complacent with its innovators.<br />Mr. Musk likened California to a sports team with a long winning streak, saying, “They do tend to get a little complacent, a little entitled, and then they don’t win the championship anymore.” California, he said, “has been winning for a long time. And I think they’re taking them for granted a little bit.”<br />Mr. Musk made the comments Tuesday during The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council annual summit in an interview with Editor in Chief Matt Murray.<br />Startup executives and employees have fled the San Francisco Bay Area for cheaper locales since the pandemic has led to remote working conditions. Last week,  Hewlett Packard Enterprise ,  whose origins trace back to the founding of Silicon Valley, said it planned to shift its headquarters to Texas. The exodus has led many tech leaders and industry watchers to question whether the geographic region is losing relevance as the nation’s leading tech hub.</td>

That would be a disaster.”<br />Chinese officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment but have said previously that the country’s military is intended for peaceful purposes.<br />Gen. Milley said the U.S. military must be prepared to launch offensive and defensive moves both in space and cyber operations, particularly against rivals like China and Russia, both of which are developing their military capabilities in those domains.</td>

And the more stressed, disconnected or lonely a person has felt, the greater the negative impact on his or her sex life has been.<br />It’s no surprise no one’s feeling sexy. We don’t like how we look, sitting around in our schlubbiest clothes, packing on pandemic pounds, getting hairier and smellier. (How long has it been since you bathed?) We’re not out in the world, doing the things that give us confidence, such as hobbies or travel. We’ve been deprived of so many daily moments of connection—the conversations, smiles or glances—that make us feel energized and alive.<br />And even if we’re not fighting with our partner—because, let’s face it, we’re in constant fight or flight mode—we’re still a little sick of the person we’ve been cooped up with 24/7. There’s nothing like familiarity to dampen desire.</td>

It was the first of eight finished MAX planes expected to be delivered to United by end of the year.<br />The United spokesman said the airline would inspect and test-fly each MAX before reintroducing the aircraft back into passenger service in the first quarter of next year. Pilots also would have to undergo new training approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.<br />The resumption of MAX deliveries is crucial to Boeing’s effort to stop bleeding cash by the end of next year or early 2022. The world-wide grounding since March 2019 has left Boeing unable to hand over finished MAX aircraft to customers who pay much of the sales price upon receipt.<br />The manufacturer had sought to resume deliveries late last year before regulators approved fixes to the aircraft’s flight-control system and related pilot training. The push ultimately faltered.</td>

      <td>Labels like Burberry and Marni are selling curious men’s shirts cobbled together from motley fabrics and patterns. Enticingly trendy or just terrifying?</td>
      <td>THERE’S A JOKEY line that men’s fashion designers rely on when presenting a collection of glaringly ho-hum button-ups and blazers: “What do you expect me to create, a shirt with three sleeves?” The remark is hammy, reflexive, but I get it. When you consider anatomical limitations and the constraints of good taste, designers can only rejigger men’s staples so many ways.<br />Or, so I thought. This month I came across a clothing item that pushed this notion of mutant shirts out of the hypothetical realm.  Burberry ,  the brand best known for Bogart’s “Casablanca” trench coat, has created a plaid flannel shirt apparently designed for a three-headed creature.<br />It has three collars: the central one through which an actual human head goes, and then two dummy button-down collars tacked on each shoulder like a linebacker’s pads, purely for effect. Though startling, this Cerberus-friendly mishmash is merely the most extreme manifestation of a trend: Other labels, from the lofty (Milan fashion house Marni) to the egalitarian (Uniqlo), have been cobbling together their own Frankenshirts.<br />More tame, the Uniqlo shirt pieces together four panels of contrasting, but uniformly dark, patterns. This orderly collage evokes Brooks Brothers’s preppy “fun shirts,” early examples of refashioned tops that, starting in the 1970s, were birthed from leftover scraps lying around the label’s shirt factory.<br />A similar leave-no-scrap-behind ethos propels the patchwork shirts of today, said Damien Paul, the head of menswear at London-based retailer Matchesfashion: “The whole point of patchwork and piecing fabrics together is about using what is available.” The examples Matches sells are quite rambunctious. To construct one hectic button-up on offer, London’s Ahluwalia label crisscrossed fragments of old striped dress shirts in a pell-mell manner. Rebuild, a line by Japanese brand Needles, sews vertical strips of different vintage flannels into wearable mayhem.</td>

      <td>The coronavirus pandemic has wiped out this year’s edition of one of the most storied rivalries in college football, as Michigan announced Tuesday that it will not play Ohio State this weekend due to a continuing outbreak on the Wolverines roster.<br />The cancellation carries heavy postseason implications for No. 4 Ohio State, which is no longer eligible to play in the Big Ten Championship despite being the last undefeated team in the conference. The Buckeyes will finish the regular season with a maximum of six games. But absent a conference championship it’s unclear if that will be enough to convince the College Football Playoff selection committee that they should get a spot in the semifinal over a 9-1 Southeastern Conference team.<br />Iowa Athletic Director Gary Barta, who chairs the CFP selection committee, has previously said that the number of games a team plays isn’t necessarily a disqualifying factor for making one of the College Football Playoff semifinals. The fewer games a team plays, the more the committee will invoke the notoriously subjective “eye test.”<br />“It is a challenge and a problem to evaluate a team that is played three games and try to evaluate them side-by-side with a team that is played nine games,” said Barta upon release of the second edition of the committee’s rankings on Dec. 1. “We’re doing it, it is doable. But it clearly becomes one of the pieces of the puzzle.”<br />The cancellation also carries consequences for Michigan, which sits at a disappointing 2-4 and whose coach, Jim Harbaugh, is entering the last year of his contract. Harbaugh is 0-4 against Ohio State during his tenure, but at a program like Michigan a win over the Buckeyes can buy a lot of goodwill from passionate fans and university regents.</td>

A final vote to approve his nomination is scheduled for later Tuesday.<br />Mr. Simington, a 41-year-old Republican lawyer currently serving in the Trump administration, appears likely to clash with Democrats over issues from “net neutrality” rules to the agency’s role in overseeing social-media content moderation under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.<br />FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, has said he is leaving the agency on Jan. 20, President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration day.<br />That could leave the bipartisan commission with two Democratic and two Republican members, including Mr. Simington. Mr. Biden can immediately designate one of the sitting Democratic commissioners as chair. But the agency’s new leader wouldn’t hold a 3-2 majority until Mr. Biden names, and the Senate approves, a fifth FCC member—a process that could stretch months if Republicans control the Senate.</td>

McDonald’s said it would use the money to fund other investments, including benefits for restaurant crew.<br />Some McDonald’s franchisees said they would raise prices on Happy Meals as a result. The children’s meals sell for an average of $3.76 nationally, McDonald’s said. Franchisees could raise prices 20 cents or more to offset the cost. McDonald’s executives said in a meeting with U.S. franchisees about the fees on Monday that owners are free to raise prices.<br />“The family business is absolutely a priority. We just believe the dollars are better invested elsewhere,” said Charlie Strong, chief field officer for McDonald’s U.S.A., during the call listened to by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Franchisees at hotels, restaurants and other consumer companies have fought with corporate offices recently over fees, promotions and supply costs.

The U.K. has been one of the worst-hit countries, with gross domestic product at the end of the third quarter almost 10% smaller than it was a year earlier.

It reflects that demand for the bonds is so high that investors who hold the bonds to maturity would get back less than they initially paid. It is also another sign of a turnaround in the market’s expectations for a more cohesive European Union.<br />A deep financial crisis in the early 2010s hit Portugal along with a number of other southern European countries, which resulted in government intervention in its banking sector. Divides emerged between northern and southern European nations, and concerns about the trade bloc fragmenting arose—resulting in significantly higher borrowing costs for countries seen as riskier and in dubious financial shape, including Portugal.<br />The coronavirus pandemic has had the opposite effect and is perceived to have brought Europe closer together, according to Rohan Khanna, a rates strategist at  UBS .  Policy makers have been actively supporting member states, both at the central bank and the European Commission, the trade bloc’s executive arm, which agreed on a €750 billion spending package, equivalent to $908 million, known as the recovery fund in July.</td>

      <td>AT&T Inc.  Chief Executive John Stankey defended the decision to release all Warner Bros. movies online the same day they hit theaters next year, arguing that the film producer had to tweak a 2020 playbook that wasn’t working during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The telecom company’s Warner Bros. unit said last week that it will release its entire 2021 film slate on HBO Max, a new film and television library designed to compete with online services such as Netflix and Disney+. The plan covers 17 movies from the science-fiction epic “Dune” to another installment of the “Matrix” franchise.<br />The choice shocked a film industry accustomed to releasing big-budget films in stages, with cinema owners getting the first bite. But U.S. box-office ticket sales have cratered since coronavirus-related restrictions shut down many venues. Those that reopened are struggling to attract large audiences.<br />“We know we probably needed to try something different,” Mr. Stankey said Tuesday during a virtual investor conference hosted by investment bank UBS Group AG. “Our feeling was, in the theatrical business, based on our best discussion with experts, we were going to be in a situation where the psyche of the population and people’s willingness to go back into large venues—that’s going to be a little bit of a prolonged recovery.”<br />Hollywood and much of the creative community has reacted angrily both to Warner Bros.’s strategy and to the short notice its executives gave their business partners. Theater owners fear that releasing the movies simultaneously on HBO Max and the big screen will drive a stake through their business.</td>

      <td>Tesla  is wisely ringing the cash register amid a stunning stock rally. Speculators should take notice.<br />The car company said on Tuesday morning that it plans to sell up to $5 billion in stock just two weeks before it is set to join the S&P 500. It would be Tesla’s second such share issue since September.<br />The sale is a no-brainer for Tesla’s long-term health. After all, the stock has more than doubled since August, when the company announced a share split, and it has rallied more than 50% in the three weeks since its planned index inclusion was announced.<br />The timing is no longer one of immediate need for liquidity: Tesla ended the third quarter with $14.5 billion in cash on its books. Still, opportunities to turn bubble stock gains into real cash shouldn’t be squandered. With this coming infusion, Tesla has likely assured its long-term corporate survival barring some extreme scenario.<br />But the long-term fate of its stock is far less certain. Tesla’s market value, which touched $600 billion on Monday, is nearly 10 times that of  General Motors ,  which dwarfs Tesla in terms of market share, profitability, and financial might. Tesla trades at more than 1,200 times trailing earnings, while established automotive industry peers go for eight times or less.</td>

      <td>‘Stakeholder capitalism’ allows the Davos crowd to obfuscate what counts as success for a business.</td>
      <td>The World Economic Forum knows never to let a good crisis go to waste. The organization behind the famous conference of politicians, executives, celebrities and “thought leaders” at Davos is now promoting an initiative called “The Great Reset.” The idea is to repackage shibboleths of the technocratic center-left for the marketing opportunity presented by Covid-19.<br />Quite a few of these policies are dangerous, but one deserves special attention: stakeholder capitalism.  Apple ,   Facebook ,   IBM  and  Walmart ,  all listed as corporate partners on the World Economic Forum website, are evidently on board with a vague and open-ended mandate for corporations to do good in the world. Yet beneath the lofty rhetoric, stakeholder capitalism is mostly a front for irresponsible corporatism. It is an attempt to siphon off cash flow from productive uses to advance the mission of “global governance” and create corporate and government sinecures for cronies along the way.<br />Milton Friedman famously fixed the modern paradigm of shareholder capitalism in a 1970 article. Writing against the dangers he perceived in popular notions of corporate social responsibility, Friedman argued that the chief duty of business was “to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception fraud.” Friedman noted correctly that, in a market economy, profits represent value created for customers. In their capacity as corporate officers, businessmen could do the most good by focusing on their bottom lines.<br />The self-perceived aristoi of Western liberal democracies hated this argument and have fought it ever since. Business leaders, eager to avoid the moral taint of greed, have often led the anti-Friedman coalition. In 2019 the CEOs of the Business Roundtable released a statement affirming that they “endeavor every day to create value for all our stakeholders, whose long-term interests are inseparable.” By stakeholders they mean “customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.”<br />As National Review’s Andrew Stuttaford notes, this vision of wide-ranging corporate beneficence introduces a host of principal-agent problems in ordinary business decision-making. Profit is a concrete and clarifying metric that allows shareholders—owners—to hold executives accountable for their performance. Adding multiple goals not related to profit introduces needless confusion.</td>

      <td>Covid relief is no ‘blue-state bailout.’ The virus doesn’t respect political boundaries.</td>
      <td>As Congress presses to complete an emergency Covid-19 relief bill, aid to states and localities continues to be a point of contention. But the novel coronavirus respects neither geographical boundaries nor partisan affiliations. Heartland states that thought they were safe turned rapidly into hot spots. As the costs of caring for the sick and trying to protect the healthy have surged, tax revenue has declined sharply. Most states and cities have responded by cutting their budgets while hoping for some assistance from the federal government. Without it, they will be forced to make even deeper cuts.<br />These cuts matter because governors and mayors are mostly in the business of delivering services their constituents need. No federal relief means less funding for education, roads, courts and police, firefighters and motor-vehicle departments. Libraries and public parks will be on the chopping block, as will the fight against opioid addiction. State and local payrolls, which have shrunk by 1.3 million, will be cut further, reducing consumer purchasing power and putting jobs in the private economy at risk.<br />This is a humanitarian challenge but also a macroeconomic problem. Reduced state and local revenue slowed the recovery from the 2007-09 recession, and the Federal Reserve chairman isn’t alone in fearing that it could happen again. Job creation has slowed for five consecutive months, and the economic recovery from the pandemic shock threatens to stall with employment almost 10 million jobs below its peak in February. The official unemployment rate is still high, and it would be higher if not for the distressing decline in labor-force participation. Millions of discouraged Americans have left the labor force, and a slow recovery will make it even harder to get them back into it.<br />Despite what some politicians are saying, federal assistance wouldn’t be a “blue-state bailout.” Some of the reddest states are among the hardest hit, not because they spend profligately but because their economies are especially vulnerable to disruption by the pandemic. Revenue in states that depend on energy taxes—Alaska, Wyoming and North Dakota, among others—have been hit hard by declining oil prices, as have revenues in states such as Florida that rely heavily on tourism.<br />Not surprisingly, governors have joined forces to advocate for continued federal assistance. The National Governors Association represents all 50 governors, 26 Republicans and 24 Democrats. On Dec. 4, the NGA’s leaders—New York Democrat Andrew Cuomo and Arkansas Republican Asa Hutchinson—issued a statement on behalf of its entire membership. It reads in part:</td>

      <td>The tensions that erupted in protests and violence for more than three months on the streets of Portland this summer are now moving into a quieter venue: the courts.<br />Federal prosecutors in the Oregon city have charged more than 90 people with crimes stemming from the skirmishes between law-enforcement officers wielding tear gas and demonstrators throwing fireworks, frozen water bottles and other objects outside the federal courthouse downtown and elsewhere.<br />The protests erupted following the May killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody and led to strained relations between the federal government, which dispatched agents to quell the violence, and local officials who saw the intervention as inflaming the unrest.<br />The federal cases filed to date represent a fraction of at least 1,000 arrests made in Portland since May, but District Attorney Mike Schmidt said after taking office in August he wouldn’t prosecute most of those arrests, citing limited resources. His office declined to pursue more than 700 cases.<br />Top Justice Department officials in Washington, meanwhile, urged federal prosecutors to be aggressive in bringing a full slate of federal charges, even suggesting they consider sedition, or plotting to overthrow the U.S. government, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. A review of protest-related cases show no such charges have been filed.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—China is aggressively advancing alternative theories about the source of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, muddying the waters as the World Health Organization prepares to launch a long-awaited investigation into the origins of the pandemic.<br />In recent weeks, Chinese state media, often suggesting the virus came from outside China, have seized on a series of recent studies that show it was spreading outside the country earlier than first assumed.<br />Government officials have also pushed the theory that the virus could have hitched a ride into the central Chinese city of Wuhan on frozen-food imports. After outbreaks in multiple Chinese cities in recent months including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and elsewhere, authorities pointed to frozen-food packaging as the potential origin.<br />While infectious disease experts say cold surfaces can be vectors for virus transmission, the WHO and other health authorities say the risk of infection from food or its packaging is thought to be low.<br />On Tuesday, a Chinese diplomat based in India posted a story about the possibility of cold-chain transmission on Twitter while calling for further investigation into an unsubstantiated fringe theory that the U.S. military was involved in spreading the virus.</td>

      <td>As traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers continue to endure sales declines, Stitch Fix’s quarterly results released Monday afternoon show how the experience of shopping for clothes could be changing for good.<br />Stitch Fix said that, in addition to double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter ended Oct. 31, it saw the highest sequential net client additions in its history. Investors sent its shares surging 42% Tuesday morning following the report.<br />That reaction is likely less a reflection of the quarter itself—revenue growth of 10% was a far cry from the 21% pace Stitch Fix posted for the comparable period last year—and more the expectation that record client growth will pay off later. It likely also was exaggerated by very high short interest in the stock heading into earnings. The company still has to show that it can improve margins.<br />Stitch Fix, which offers algorithmically personalized clothing with the help of a stylist, for years has been asking new clients to ditch decade-old habits of trying clothing on in a store before paying for it. For the first several months of the pandemic, it seemed this was too big of an ask for many shoppers. Stitch Fix’s sales in the quarter ended Aug. 1 grew just 3% from a year earlier after falling by more than 9% in the prior period.<br />But the company’s latest results suggest that many more consumers are coming around, and it is happening just as a window of opportunity is about to close: When more shoppers feel comfortable visiting shopping malls as Covid-19 cases recede, Stitch Fix might have hooked customers for good.</td>

It continued trading its employees’ own money.<br />The SEC said BlueCrest created the proprietary fund, BSMA Limited, in 2011 and moved a majority of its best traders to work on it. Their work picking assets for BlueCrest’s flagship fund was replaced by an algorithm that was supposed to replicate their decisions but wound up performing worse, the SEC said.<br />“BlueCrest repeatedly failed to act in the best interests of its investors, including by not disclosing that it was transferring its highest-performing traders to a fund that benefited its own personnel to the detriment of its fund investors,” said SEC enforcement director Stephanie Avakian.<br />BlueCrest settled the SEC’s civil investigation without admitting to or denying the claims. In a statement, the firm said it was pleased to have resolved the matter, “which primarily involved disclosures that were made more than five years ago.”</td>

The company raised the same amount of money through a similar program it rolled out in September.<br />Tesla’s share price is more than nine times higher than it was a year ago after adjusting for a recent stock split, as the company has been able to improve its liquidity and keep its streak of profitable quarters going—now up to five—amid the coronavirus pandemic. Last month, S&P Dow Jones Indices said Tesla would be added to the S&P 500 index in December, boosting the stock’s mainstream appeal.<br />The fundraising coincides with significant investments in the company’s production capacity. Tesla is planning to start work on a new U.S. factory in Austin, Texas, and is also building a plant in Berlin.<br />Plans to boost capacity contributed to Tesla’s projections for capital spending in 2021 and 2022.

Earlier this year, DoorDash was privately valued at more than $15 billion, up from just $1.4 billion in 2018.

      <td>In a sign of investors’ meager appetite for driverless-car ventures,  Uber Technologies Inc.  isn’t so much selling its ill-fated project as paying a rival to take it on.<br />The ride-hailing giant said late Monday that its autonomous-driving unit ATG would be acquired by Aurora Innovation Inc., a startup with about half the staff. But this is no usual acquisition: Aurora isn’t handing over cash; in fact, it gets $400 million of extra capital from Uber as part of the deal.<br />For the ride-hailing giant, the appeal of the transaction is that it takes driverless cars off its balance sheet. It owned roughly 86% of ATG at the end of September, having sold small stakes to Toyota, its parts supplier  Denso  and to Japanese tech investor SoftBank last year at a valuation of $7.25 billion. After the deal with Aurora, it will only own about 26% of the venture, while the ATG minorities will own a further 14%.<br />Crucially, that means Uber, which is under pressure to trim losses, won’t have to consolidate the significant expense of developing driverless cars in its accounts. The deal also draws a line under an endeavor that gave the company endless public-relations grief: In 2017, Alphabet’s rival business Waymosued Uber for stealing trade secrets, and a year later one of Uber’s test vehicles killed a pedestrian.<br />Still, Aurora is the more obvious winner. The company has the credibility of being founded in 2017 by three veterans of the driverless-car industry, but was looking isolated after most big car makers found other startups to work with. Now it has Uber, Toyota and Denso as minority investors, all three among the largest players in their different fields.</td>

      <td>While Democratic and Republican lawmakers have expressed new optimism that they will reach a coronavirus aid deal, the current round of talks excludes a second round of stimulus checks for households. Here is the latest on the negotiations, and a look at whether checks could still be on the table.<br />A bipartisan group of lawmakers has been working for weeks on a $908 billion package of coronavirus aid, much of which has been agreed upon. But lawmakers are still in negotiations over how to work out the two thorniest components: funding for state and local aid and what sort of legal protections to provide businesses, schools and other entities operating during the pandemic. Lawmakers have said they hope to finalize an agreement and turn it into legislative text in the next couple of days. Congressional leaders have been involved in the discussions, but could play a larger role in coming days.<br />The current bipartisan proposal includes enhanced jobless aid, but doesn’t include funding for another round of direct payments that would reach most households. Including payments similar to the $1,200-plus checks in the spring would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and Republicans have been clear that $900 billion is already more than they would like to spend. Many Republicans are terming this round of talks an emergency aid package, rather than a stimulus plan.<br />It’s not out of the question yet. Democrats and a few Republicans are still pushing to add a second round of stimulus checks into any agreement this year. And before the election, President Trump repeatedly urged Congress to send him additional coronavirus aid that included another round of direct checks. Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) said Monday he had urged Mr. Trump to veto any bill that didn’t include them. And many Democrats are still hoping to see them included.<br />“Direct checks are an excellent way to get money into the hands of people who desperately need it,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said.</td>

But the startup has pulled ahead of competitors in some big cities, too.<br />With little competition in the suburbs, DoorDash earned big bucks from families placing large orders. It also gave priority to expanding the number of restaurants on its app, while  Uber Technologies Inc.’s  Eats focused on restaurants with fast delivery.</td>

      <td>The Trump administration’s sanctioning of 14 senior Chinese leaders is the heaviest in a series of blows aimed at Beijing in response to its crackdown on Hong Kong. If earlier measures are a guide, the effect will be mostly symbolic.<br />The U.S. announced sanctions Monday against more than half of China’s 25-member top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, that officials in Washington said was central to China’s efforts to rein in freedoms in Hong Kong. The body has imposed a national security law and barred opposition legislators in recent months.<br />Hours after the U.S. move, Hong Kong police arrested eight activists, including opposition legislators and protest organizers, in dawn raids across the city, the latest in a series of arrests of prominent figures accused of crimes over their roles in last year’s antigovernment uprising. Pro-democracy groups say efforts to crush opposition in the city are increasing, despite the rising international condemnation of China.<br />“The Chinese will view the designations of 14 NPC officials as an irritant, but not consequential,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. “Beijing has already made the decision to impose its rule over Hong Kong. Such symbolic steps are unlikely to affect its actions.”<br />China expressed anger over the sanctions, with its foreign ministry Tuesday summoning Robert W. Forden, the U.S. chargé d’affaires in Beijing, to condemn the measures. A ministry spokeswoman told a regular briefing that it firmly opposed U.S. interference and said it wouldn’t affect China’s Hong Kong policies.</td>

      <td>Wireless companies including Verizon expected to splurge on U.S. auction of C-band spectrum</td>
      <td>Verizon Communications Inc.  and other cellphone providers are expected to spend billions of dollars to secure prized spectrum for their 5G networks in a U.S. government sale that kicks off Tuesday.<br />The Federal Communications Commission is launching a new auction for C-band airwaves, a stretch of wireless frequencies especially valued by companies trying to offer the fifth-generation service.<br />Typical bidders like Verizon,  AT&T Inc.  and  T-Mobile US Inc.  registered to participate. Cable, technology and investment companies also entered the contest, which could last several weeks.<br />“They all need to have a foot in the door,” said Davis Hebert, an analyst at debt research firm CreditSights. “C-band is going to be the cornerstone of 5G networks for the next decade.”<br />Wall Street analysts expect the auction to raise tens of billions of dollars over the coming weeks, a reflection of high demand. The frequencies sit in what telecom executives consider a “sweet spot” for 5G transmissions because they can move plenty of data quickly while still traveling long distances from a cellular tower.</td>

      <td>As the Internet-of-Things proliferates, consumers want to know how their data will be used by the makers of devices—before they buy them</td>
      <td>Your milk and orange juice have nutrition labels. Soon your refrigerator and coffee maker could, too.<br />For years, consumer privacy advocates have pushed the idea of so-called nutrition labels for devices. Instead of telling consumers how much vitamin B or C a product has, these labels would tell the prospective purchasers how their data will be used and by whom.<br />Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab Security and Privacy Institute are floating a working prototype of how such a label could look. They’re providing their label—vetted by researchers and numerous privacy experts—free of charge to Internet-of-Things, or IoT, device makers, standards organizations and others. Discussions for adoption are still in the early stages. But advocates hope device makers will adopt this type of label, or that organizations such as Underwriters Laboratories, an independent safety-testing and certification company, or Consumer Reports will use at least portions of the label in their review processes, says Lorrie Cranor, the director and Bosch distinguished professor in security and privacy technologies at CyLab.<br />The label is designed to go on a product’s packaging or on the websites where the devices are sold. Products under consideration for carrying the label could include any smart device that is connected to the internet—including security cameras, refrigerators, speakers, home controllers, doorbells, toothbrushes, thermostats, light switches, smart plugs and much more, says Dr. Cranor, who is also a professor of computer science and a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon.<br />The idea of protecting data privacy becomes more of an issue as more products connect to the internet. On Dec. 8,  Apple Inc.  began requiring app developers to provide information about their applications’ privacy practices before submitting new apps and app updates to the App Store. What’s more, consumer organizations are increasingly incorporating data privacy into their ratings, while some states have enacted, or are considering, privacy legislation. The Federal Trade Commission, which also has raised the concept of a nutrition label for privacy, says it continues to support the efforts of industry groups in this area.</td>

      <td>Pfizer could ship vaccines as soon as clearance granted, which could come as early as this weekend</td>
      <td>The Food and Drug Administration concluded in a detailed analysis that the first Covid-19 vaccine being considered for U.S. distribution “met the prescribed success criteria” in a clinical study, suggesting the agency will soon green-light the historic product.<br />The agency Tuesday released two separate analyses, one from its own staff scientists and one from the vaccine’s manufacturers,  Pfizer Inc.  and German partner  BioNTech SE .<br />The FDA analysis highlighted various “known benefits” from the vaccine. These included “reduction in the risk of confirmed Covid-19 occurring at least seven days after Dose 2.” The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses for full protection.<br />In addition, the FDA said another benefit was reduction in the risk of confirmed Covid-19 after the first dose and before the second dose. Another clear benefit, the agency said, was “reduction in the risk of confirmed severe Covid-19 any time after dose 1.”<br />The reference to reduction in confirmed severe disease was important, as early critics of some of the vaccine trials were concerned that only mild to moderate disease was prevented.</td>

      <td>Advancing Women Artists was founded by the late pioneering philanthropist known as ‘Indiana Jane’; the closure comes as a surprise</td>
      <td>FLORENCE—Advancing Women Artists, the nonprofit devoted to rescuing the forgotten works of female artists and founded by the late pioneering philanthropist Jane Fortune, is folding. A message sent to AWA members on Dec. 1 and posted to its website said: “In June 2021, our much-loved organization will officially close its doors.”<br />Since its foundation in 2009, AWA has identified hundreds of works created by Italian women artists between the 16th and 20th centuries and financed the restoration of 70. Last year, the organization attracted world-wide attention with the unveiling of perhaps the most ambitious work known to have been painted by a woman during the Italian Renaissance: Plautilla Nelli’s Last Supper.<br />Many of the canvasses located by AWA were found, caked with grime, in dusty museum storerooms and dank Tuscan churches. The organization’s work earned Ms. Fortune the nickname in Italy of “Indiana Jane”—an allusion both to her native state and the intrepid fictional treasure hunter, Indiana Jones.<br />Ironically, the announcement of AWA’s closure has come at a time of unprecedented interest in women’s art. Twentieth century female artists have achieved record prices in the sale rooms; a work by the British painter Jenny Saville went under the hammer in 2018 for more than $10 million, the highest amount ever paid for a painting by a woman. Last February, Columbia University art historian Michael Cole published a substantial monograph on Sofonisba Anguissola, a 16th century Italian artist. And recently, the National Gallery in London inaugurated a major exhibition devoted to Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi.<br />Last week’s announcement from AWA, which gave no reason for its closure, came as a surprise to many supporters of the organization. The organization’s director, Linda Falcone, said AWA lacked the financial resources to continue with its work and had been unable to find a benefactor to succeed Ms. Fortune, who died in 2018.</td>

      <td>Fitness+, Apple’s new subscription service for on-demand workouts, arrives next week with 21 trainers across 10 disciplines.</td>
      <td>The fact that Apple’s six-country launch of a new connected workout platform, Fitness+, which arrives in the Apple store next week, is happening during a surge in a global pandemic that carved out a new market for home fitness is, Apple insists, pure coincidence (“Siri, what’s a synonym for providential?”)<br />“It does feel like people might think we built Fitness+ because of Covid,” Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of fitness technologies, tells me via a video call from the company’s fitness studio in Los Angeles. “But we’ve been working on it for a very, very long time.”<br />From the Apple Watch’s launch, more than five years ago, Blahnik says “fitness has been a really big part of [its] story.” With the launch of Fitness+, however, Apple aims to create a new ecosystem for the watch: a subscription-based, on-demand virtual-fitness studio, with an initial 21-person team of trainers (recruited after an intensive search, in which Apple says “no gym was too gritty for us to go into”), covering 10 disciplines—from high-intensity interval training to dance workouts to rowing to “mindful cooldowns”—offering a fresh slate of workouts, of varying lengths, every week (all set to the beat of Apple Music).<br />Apple doesn’t make fitness equipment—at least not yet—but the watch, arguably, is fitness equipment. Workouts and activity tracking are, Apple says, among the device’s most popular features. From the get-go, the watch had been making inroads into wearers’ wellness routines, not simply by keeping track of their daily movements but by encouraging them to “close your rings,” or complete three color-coded, adjustable-difficulty tasks: “Stand,” for spending at least a minute moving around every hour for 12 hours; “Move,” for burning a certain number of active calories; and “Exercise,” for doing at least 30 minutes of an activity as or more strenuous than brisk walking. It also offers gentle exhortations to pause for deep-breathing exercises.<br />In its fitness lab, the company has been closely tracking more than a hundred thousand hours of activity—across a range of workouts—all with the goal of improving the watch’s accuracy at discerning, say, what stroke you are employing as you swim laps.</td>

Higher steel prices in recent months have helped U.S. Steel raise enough cash to complete the purchase sooner than expected, a person familiar with the matter said.<br />The spot-market price for coiled sheet steel in the U.S. has rallied to $856 a ton on Monday from below $500 a ton this summer, as a rebounding manufacturing sector ramps up orders.<br />Shares of U.S. Steel rose 4.8% to $18.01 in morning trading.</td>
