      <td>Numerous senior officials have recently departed New York state’s Health Department. What exactly did they know before deciding to stop working for Gov. Andrew Cuomo? Empire State citizens deserve an answer and  federal law enforcement ought to be interested as well.<br />The New York Post’s Bernadette Hogan, Carl Campanile and Bruce Golding break the story of an appalling abuse of power:<br />Ms. DeRosa is now claiming that Team Cuomo was cooperative and transparent in sharing information with the U.S. Department of Justice. But New York’s failure to publicly acknowledge its nursing home death toll and prioritize the protection of the elderly—the state instead inflicted broad, destructive lockdowns on the general population—had consequences far beyond New York. The state was an early virus hot spot and its false data presented a misleading picture of Covid impact as scientists and policy makers sought to understand the new health threat.<br />In the wake of the Post report, Jesse McKinley and Luis Ferré-Sadurní of the New York Times note:<br />One wonders how long the truth about nursing home deaths might have remained hidden if a few stout-hearted contrarians like Janice Dean of Fox News, the Albany Times-Union newspaper and the Empire Center think tank had not diligently challenged the official story.</td>

      <td>The answer to Francis X. Rocca’s “Can Catholic Social Teaching Unite a Divided America?” (Review, Feb. 6) is, unfortunately, no. Catholic social teaching may have something for both left and right, but the progressive wing of Roman Catholicism has more in common with secular progressives than with conservative Catholics and other Christians. Closing the ideological and moral divide within the U.S., Catholicism and Christianity in general is not likely to be a win-win. One side considers loving and taking care of your neighbors to be a personal responsibility. The other wants the state to take care of neighbors in need by taking resources from other neighbors. Conservative Christians will render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, as instructed, but do not expect Caesar to relieve us of all obligations to neighbors, nor will we ever expect Caesar to create a progressive heaven on earth.<br />Ryan Graham<br />Melbourne, Fla.<br /><br />The conservative Catholics’ point is that if Joe Biden continues to support abortion, he and others like him cannot have a meaningful discourse on real solutions to what ails society because a fundamental understanding is missing: God is love. All of God’s creation has value and must be loved. Trying to solve social issues without having the conversation about the value of human life is like trying to grow a plant without acknowledging the critical element of its root system.</td>

Don’t Bet on It” (Feb. 6): Prof. Alba points out the erroneous belief that certain racial minority and ethnic groups are isomorphically committed to a certain political party. President Trump’s gains with blacks and Hispanics demonstrated that their political convictions are more malleable, which Mr. Alba attributes in part to “racial mixing.” No doubt intermarriage and a more complex idea of racial and ethnic identity contribute to that, but there is another powerful factor that moves people over time from left to right on the political spectrum, and it is strangely absent in debates in our “woke” culture: social class.<br />The left portrays racial and ethnic minorities (with the exception of Asians, Jews, and other successful groups) as hapless victims of historical oppression, and who are now in need of government (i.e., taxpayer) largess to make up for those historical inequities. However, people of color who have worked hard over a generation or two and have earned their place in the middle class often resent the condescension of whites diminishing their successful efforts by attributing their success to liberal policies. Those who earned their stake in America through hard work know the difference between equal opportunity and equal outcomes, and start to vote accordingly.<br />Tom O’Hare, Ph.D.<br />Boston College<br /></td>

Holman Correctional Facility to accommodate inmate Willie B. Smith III’s final request. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas separately indicated that he would let the execution proceed.<br />That means either Justice Samuel Alito or Justice Neil Gorsuch—or both—took Mr. Smith’s side.<br />Mr. Smith was convicted of the 1991 murder of Sharma Ruth Johnson, 22 years old, whom he and a teenage accomplice first kidnapped and robbed when she stopped at an ATM in Birmingham, Ala. The jury voted 10-2 for a death sentence instead of life imprisonment.<br />Alabama said Mr. Smith was being treated fairly because prison policy currently allows no inmate to have a minister alongside as they are put to death. Mr. Smith argued that a 2000 federal law, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, required the state to accommodate his request.</td>

But, unlike the bulk of his band’s repertory, Ellington didn’t compose it—that honor belongs to Billy Strayhorn, his longtime writing and arranging partner.<br />This stirring dance number, as recorded on Feb. 15, 1941, marked Strayhorn’s breakthrough as a composer. Opening or closing countless concerts with it, Ellington made it his band’s signature tune. Noted musicians have told me that, even after hearing it hundreds of times, they never tire of its masterly construction and swinging exuberance—it always seems familiar yet fresh.</td>

Insight is also currently seeking $875 million for its first fund focused exclusively on preferred equity investments.<br />Insight provides between $10 million and $350 million of equity for technology companies, particularly software companies, across a range of capital structures that span venture rounds to larger buyouts of public companies.<br />The firm focuses on subsectors that include software-enabled services and internet companies, as well as software-as-a-service companies, which have subscription-based business models that often generate strong recurring revenue, according to documents from Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System. The pension system committed $150 million to Insight Partners XI.<br />Insight Partners’ latest fundraise will benefit from the increased investor demand for technology-focused private-equity funds, one of the people said. During the pandemic, increased need for new software collaboration tools drove the growth of software cloud services. The market for such services is poised to hit $312.25 billion in 2021, a 19% increase from $262.45 billion in 2020, according to research firm  Gartner Inc.</td>

      <td>The Washington, D.C., museum looks forward to its second century with a new exhibition, ‘Seeing Differently.’</td>
      <td>The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., America’s first museum dedicated to modern art, was the product of a pandemic. In 1918, the art collector Duncan Phillips lost his only brother, James, to the flu that was ravaging the globe; their father, a Civil War veteran and businessman, had died of a heart condition not long before. In 1921, Duncan Phillips honored their memory by turning his home into a museum, originally named the Phillips Memorial Art Gallery.<br />A century later, in the midst of another pandemic, the Phillips is celebrating its anniversary with a new exhibition, “Seeing Differently: The Phillips Collects for a New Century.” Scheduled to open March 6, Covid restrictions permitting, the show features about 250 works chosen from the museum’s collection of more than 6,000 objects. Senior curator Elsa Smithgall said that the exhibition organizers worked with a 13-member community advisory board, which hewed to Duncan Phillips’s collecting philosophy of embracing “a multiplicity of types of works and types of perspectives.” The results include paintings, quilts, sculpture, photographs, works on paper and videos by an international array of artists.<br />The centennial show is organized around “the way that artists explore the complexities of our ever-changing world through four lenses,” Ms. Smithgall said: the senses, identity, history and place. The first section, on the senses, is meant “to hit people with a really powerful sensory experience around color,” she explained, with works such as Alexander Calder’s 1939 wire sculpture “Hollow Egg” and Alma Thomas’s “Breeze Rustling Through Fall Flowers,” a 1968 acrylic on canvas with bands of rich color on a pale background. The 2011 work “Scramble” by Leo Villareal, a commanding five-foot-square grid of light-emitting diodes, hangs near quilts made in Gee’s Bend, Ala., that echo its bright squares.<br />Works in the identity section show “how art can open a window into our understanding of self and how we also see the other,” Ms. Smithgall said. Among them are “Melancholy,” Degas’s evocative portrait from the 1860s of a wistful woman curled into an armchair, and “Untitled (Hood 2),” a 2016 photograph by John Edmonds of an individual whose identity is hidden by a sweatshirt. “Maman Calcule,” a 2013 work by the Belgium-based Congolese artist Aimé Mpane, is a mosaic portrait of a woman in Kinshasa composed of hundreds of carved plywood tiles. There are also portraits by El Greco and Goya, along with self-portraits by Paul Cézanne, in full beard and high-collared jacket, and Milton Avery, in red beret and scarf, a cigarette drooping from his lips.<br />The history section of the show homes in on three topics: Revolution and War, Migration and Displacement, and Slavery and the Legacy of the Civil War. Among the works on display is Honoré Daumier’s “The Uprising,” a scene from 1848’s revolutionary events in France, in which a woman wearing a white shirt and cap surges forward amid the faces and top hats. Duncan Phillips acquired the painting in 1925 and considered it one of the finest in the collection. It is joined by 30 panels from Jacob Lawrence’s “Migration Series,” which chronicles the experiences of African-Americans heading to northern states in search of better lives.</td>

      <td>The first time Shelby Steele used the word “equity” in one of his books—“White Guilt,” published in 2006—he was referring to the value his father had accrued in restoring “three ramshackle homes to neat lower-middle-class acceptability.” This was in 1950s Chicago, a city the author describes as “virulently segregated.” Shelby Steele Sr., a Southern-born black truck driver who’d left school in third grade to work the fields, concealed his homeownership from his white employer. He was afraid he’d be fired for “getting above himself.”<br />No bank would loan the elder Steele money, so he used bricks, discarded lumber, and cast-off roofing shingles to render the properties rentable. “That’s what we used to call equity,” says Mr. Steele, the son. “The sense of the word I grew up with has no relationship at all to the meaning it has taken on today.”<br />Mr. Steele, 75, is a longstanding conservative commentator on race in America and a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. We speak over Zoom a week after President Biden signed an Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity, intended to address “entrenched disparities in our laws and public policies, and in our public and private institutions.” In his remarks at the signing, Mr. Biden seemed to suggest that his is a project aimed at reshaping American governance. “We need to make the issue of racial equity not just an issue for any one department of government,” the president said. “It has to be the business of the whole of government.”<br />I can almost hear Mr. Steele growl in his study in Monterey, Calif., as I read these words aloud. “This equity is a term that has no meaning,” he says, “but it’s one that gives blacks power and leverage in American life. We can throw it around at any time, and wherever it lands, it carries this stigma that somebody’s a bigot.” Its message is that there’s “inequality that needs to be addressed, to be paid off. So if you hear me using the word ‘equity,’ I’m shaking you down.”<br />Equity in this “new sense,” Mr. Steele says, can be understood only as “a strategy.” The president is promising to “fix America morally, and aligning himself with the strategy of black people to gain power by focusing on victimization. He’s saying, ‘America must tackle that problem and create programs that help minorities achieve equity’—whatever that may be.”</td>

      <td>As we’ve quarantined at home, our needs for privacy, security, flexibility, floppability and beauty have changed the way we want to live. Here, 13 décor trends courtesy of 2020.</td>
      <td>LAST AUGUST, interior-design blogger Lydia Elder found herself buying something that never would have darkened her door before the pandemic hit: a blush pink beanbag chair. “Schools were closed, and with our family of four at home all the time, we needed some extra, flexible seating,” she said. Now everyone in her 1,610-square-foot household in Kent, England—including her 6-foot-6-inch husband—is besotted with the smushy seat and, what's more, her young children have found it obligingly stands in for a volcano, mountain or quicksand. “It’s given us an extra place to relax that can be transferred across rooms depending on where the rest of the family is, and how much peace and quiet you want,” Ms. Elder said.<br />The trials of lockdown have led us to crave decorating solutions from easily hauled seats to lush wallpaper murals that transport us to inaccessible locales. As homeowners and interior designers have come up with intrepid fixes for current conundrums, the ingenuity has given rise to micro-trends. These 13 struck us as the most clever and doable.<br />The big, dark rectangle has always been a décor crasher, but with all the ever-present computers we need to work and learn remotely, the television is one more black hole. “We just don’t want to see [the TV] all the time anymore,” said Toronto designer Colette van den Thillart. She has concealed five of them since the pandemic started, hiding one behind a 1940s chinoiserie screen. In a London home library local designer Rose Uniacke camouflaged the telly behind fabric in the 1882 William Morris pattern of the wallpaper—to serenely seamless effect.<br />A seat with an undeniable nostalgia factor, the beanbag chair was introduced in 1969, when Italian designers Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro unveiled the Zanotta “Sacco” chair at the Paris Furniture Fair. Today the beanbag’s flexibility as a movable seat has brought it back as Americans struggle to improvise quiet spots in a crowded home. On Instagram, #beanbag counts 438,000 posts, and FatSak, a South African beanbag brand, reports a 200% spike in year-over-year sales this January. A rakish pompom denotes the top of one of our favorite blobs, a Hershey’s Kiss-shaped corduroy version. Corduroy Beanbag—Caramel, $165, burkedecor.com<br />Ms. van den Thillart admits she initially viewed rechargeable lamps with skepticism, fretting the light would be “crappy—too blue.” Still, seeking maximum flexibility from limited space, she decided to try them in her crowded home. After toting one from bedside to bathtub, she found it “completely life-changing. Every time I take one to a client, I lose it because they won’t give it back.” Philippe Malouin’s gracefully arched Arca Portable lamp has four settings, from ambient to task, and lasts up to 30 hours before needing a boost.  $275, mattermade.us</td>

      <td>The romantic label for swashbucklers used by Tampa Bay’s NFL team has the same Caribbean roots as a term for barbecuing pork</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />When the Tampa Bay Buccaneers celebrated their Super Bowl victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, they did so in a style befitting their name: with a rowdy boat parade.<br />In Wednesday’s nautical celebration, a flotilla of boats carried Tom Brady and his carousing teammates along the Hillsborough River near downtown Tampa to the city’s port. The procession resembled Tampa’s annual Gasparilla Pirate Festival commemorating the legendary pirate José Gaspar, known as “the Last of the Buccaneers.”<br />The team’s name brings to mind romantic images of swashbucklers on the high seas. But the origins of the term go back to hunters grilling the meat of wild animals in the Caribbean.<br />When Europeans began colonizing Latin America, they incorporated many indigenous practices. One was slow-roasting meat over a fire using a wooden framework. In Taíno, spoken on several Caribbean islands, this cooking method was called “barbacoa,” which was borrowed into Spanish and eventually gave rise to the English word “barbecue.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration says it won’t be ending tariffs on imported European wine, cheese and other food imports any time soon—to the dismay of industry groups who say the levies are hurting U.S. restaurants and consumers.<br />The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Friday it was unnecessary for now to suspend the levies, which were imposed by the Trump administration as part of a longstanding dispute with the European Union over commercial aircraft subsidies.<br />In a regulatory filing, the USTR said it would “continue to consider the action taken in the investigation,” referring to a 17-year-old dispute over how governments subsidize  Boeing Co.  and  Airbus SE .  The Biden administration has said it is reviewing the tariffs and other major trade policy actions adopted by the previous administration.<br />Under the Trump administration, the dispute turned into a tariff fight that snared food and beverage industries unrelated to aircraft manufacturing. Washington imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European wine and food items like cheese and olives in late 2019.<br />The European Union hit back with levies on U.S. whiskey, nuts and tobacco valued around $4.5 billion. The U.S. stepped up the sanctions on Dec. 31 with additional tariffs, placing virtually all wine imports from France and Germany under its 25% tariff.</td>

      <td>BEIJING—Chinese authorities refused to provide World Health Organization investigators with raw, personalized data on early Covid-19 cases that could help them determine how and when the coronavirus first began to spread in China, according to WHO investigators who described heated exchanges over the lack of detail.<br />The Chinese authorities turned down requests to provide such data on 174 cases of Covid-19 that they have identified from the early phase of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. The investigators are part of a WHO team that this week completed a monthlong mission in China aimed at determining the origins of the pandemic.<br />Chinese officials and scientists provided their own extensive summaries and analysis of data on the cases, said the WHO team members. They also supplied aggregated data and analysis on retrospective searches through medical records in the months before the Wuhan outbreak was identified, saying that they had found no evidence of the virus.<br />But the WHO team wasn’t allowed to view the raw underlying data on those retrospective studies, which could allow them to conduct their own analysis on how early and how extensively the virus began to spread in China, the team members said. Member states typically provide such data—anonymized, but disaggregated so investigators can see all other relevant details on each case—as part of WHO investigations, said team members.<br />“They showed us a couple of examples, but that’s not the same as doing all of them, which is standard epidemiological investigation,” said Dominic Dwyer, an Australian microbiologist on the WHO team. “So then, you know, the interpretation of that data becomes more limited from our point of view, although the other side might see it as being quite good.”</td>

Andrew Cuomo after learning his administration held off releasing a fuller accounting of Covid-19 deaths in the state’s nursing homes out of its fear that former President Donald Trump’s administration would politicize the information.<br />A top aide to the Democratic governor told Democratic state lawmakers in a private meeting this week that a U.S. Department of Justice probe last year prompted the Cuomo administration to sideline a request from state legislators to say how many nursing-home residents died from the virus after they were transferred to hospitals.<br />The New York Post on Thursday night first reported the details of the Wednesday meeting based on a recording. The Cuomo administration released a partial transcript of the meeting on Friday.<br />“We froze,” Melissa DeRosa, the governor’s secretary, said according to the transcript. “We were in a position where we weren’t sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice or what we give to you guys and what we start saying was going to be used against us and we weren’t sure if there was going to be an investigation.”<br />Republicans said Ms. DeRosa’s statements were an admission that the governor was purposefully covering up the administration’s actions, and reiterated calls for an independent probe.</td>

      <td>After decades in an industry obsessed with youth, the designer writes in her new book that ‘you can feel better and be better with age’</td>
      <td>Norma Kamali was 29 in 1975 when she left her husband of 10 years and the fashion company they had built together. On her own, she had $98, a small Manhattan apartment with a mattress, and her self-esteem, which was fragile but intact. She loved designing clothing but had no idea how to run a business.<br />“I was in a really bad situation,” Ms. Kamali says. She usually kept her problems to herself, but her story tumbled out in a meeting with a Los Angeles Times fashion editor, who swiftly arranged a loan of some sewing machines. “I started to realize that communication is everything,” Ms. Kamali, 75, says over Zoom from her company’s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. “If people believe in you, they can actually help.”<br />Ms. Kamali borrowed money from friends and family to launch a new business in 1976 called OMO (“On My Own”) Norma Kamali. That same year, Farrah Fawcett wore a red swimsuit designed by Ms. Kamali in an iconic photograph. (The suit is now part of the Smithsonian collection.) Christie Brinkley made famous another Kamali swimsuit—a high-cut, lavender bikini—on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine the following year. By 1980, when her pioneering designs for chic clothes made from sweatshirt material had department-store shoppers lining up around the block, Ms. Kamali had little trouble paying back her creditors.<br />Looking back, Ms. Kamali admits to learning some lessons the hard way. Among the most valuable, she says, was the decision to set off on her own. “Walking away is one of the most important things I’ve learned in my life,” she writes in her new book, “I Am Invincible,” which she calls “a handbook on aging with power.” Leaving a relationship or a business deal is never easy, she notes. But in situations that threaten your soul or your integrity, walking away “signifies being in control and aware of your worth.”<br />As the sole owner and designer of her eponymous company for 45 years, Ms. Kamali has earned an ardent following for her ingenuity and longevity. Designs that she conceived decades ago, such as her early swimsuits and her stylishly warm sleeping bag coat, remain bestsellers, even as editors praise her latest collections as among her best to date. In an industry known for ephemerality, Ms. Kamali has a rare knack for staying relevant. Her modish, user-friendly designs have kept her factories humming through the pandemic, which lends further credence to a book filled with her advice.</td>

      <td>Turkey’s most hypnotic city isn’t as inaccessible as you think. You can teleport yourself there anytime with these TV shows, films, dishes, books and at least one psychedelic rock ’n’ roll band.</td>
      <td>FOR MOST AMERICAN visitors, Turkey’s biggest city is familiar and surprising at the same time. Stroll the streets of Istanbul and you’ll find Apple Stores, Shake Shacks and chic, hijab-covered women Rollerblading along the seaside, all against an age-old soundtrack—the call to prayer streaming through the speakers of the city’s countless mosques. It’s not so much about East meeting West; Istanbul’s cultural abundance makes those very categories feel obsolete. The city’s innumerable attractions—the Ottoman-era palaces, the sumptuous art museums, the sensational food and shopping—all make it a magnetic destination. For intrepid travelers, Istanbul is still a top temptation given that Turkey is one of the few countries that currently allows U.S. tourists. Americans are welcome as long as they show proof of a negative Covid-19 test (though the CDC still deems Turkey, as well as most of Europe, highly risky in terms of the virus). But like a lot of places right now, Istanbul lacks its usual swagger. For the last two months, this city of 16 million falls silent every weekday at 9 p.m. under a strictly enforced curfew. On weekends, residents can leave their homes only for grocery shopping. Restaurants are open just for takeout or delivery during the week, and only delivery on weekends. Tourists are exempt from curfews, and hotel restaurants can serve meals to guests, but the streets empty of locals can feel ghostly. Until those streets fill up again, you may prefer to explore the city another way—by sampling some of the music, movies, books and tastes that will surely make you want to visit in the flesh just as soon as the time is right.<br />In this lyrical memoir, Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk recounts his childhood growing up in a well-to-do household. He intersperses his personal experiences with historical accounts of Istanbul by noted visitors, including Gustave Flaubert, using his reflections on various sites and neighborhoods to examine not only his own identity as a writer but how Istanbulites see themselves and their place in the world.<br />A 2018 Pulitzer Prize finalist for nonfiction, Hansen’s book is primarily a study of the impact of American policies and actions in the Middle East. But the chapters set in Istanbul also vividly capture the intelligence, color and humor of the people she encounters. For an armchair traveler, it’s the next best thing to meeting locals in person.<br />The main sleuth in this breezy Istanbul-based mystery—the fourth and most recent of Mehmet Murat Somer’s popular Turkish Delight series—is Burçak Veral, a transvestite who dresses like Audrey Hepburn. She also serves as a highly entertaining and food-obsessed tour guide to the city.<br />If you want to try preparing Turkish dishes at home, “The Turkish Cookbook,” by Musa Dagdeviren covers the broad range of Turkey’s cuisine. Mr. Dagdeviren spent years travelling the country to preserve regional recipes, a journey also chronicled on  Netflix ’s  “Chef’s Table” series. Here are three local specialties recommended by Mr. Dagdeviren, each one a culinary history lesson.</td>

      <td>Female investors have a cautious view of equities. That is a problem—for women as well as the rest of the finance world.</td>
      <td>“I think we’re a bit outnumbered, but we’re here.” So said one commenter on a Reddit thread about whether women joined in the recent WallStreetBets trading frenzy.<br />Female investors largely sat out the riskiest punts taken on stocks like GameStop. That may be no bad thing considering the videogame retailer’s stock is down over 80% from its late-January peak. But low female participation in stock-market investing more generally is a problem, for women and the finance industry alike.<br />Less than one-quarter of deposits into U.S. brokerage accounts were made by women in January, according to consumer-spending data analytics firm Cardify. Globally, the situation may be even worse: Israel-based brokerage eToro said that female investors make up just 14% of its registered users, most of whom are in the U.S. and Europe.<br />Some trading platforms did a good job of signing up women during the pandemic. Just over a third of Robinhood users were female at the beginning of this year, up from 20.5% a year before, according to Cardify. For the finance industry as a whole, though, attracting more female custom remains a frustratingly slow work in progress.<br />Women tend to be more conservative investors than men, preferring to put their wealth into real estate, cash or bonds while steering clear of equities.  Credit Suisse  surveyed a sample of existing clients and found that almost half of its female customers have 90% of their wealth tied up in low-yielding cash and fixed income—well over double the exposure the Swiss bank recommends.</td>

      <td>Silence on human-rights issues risks alienating U.S. consumers; speaking up could earn the host nation’s ire</td>
      <td>On the evening of Feb. 4, 2022, an opening ceremony in Beijing is scheduled to kick off the Winter Olympics, the second time in 14 years the Games will be held in China. But more than medals will be on the line. The 2022 Games highlight a dilemma facing potential sponsors: Risk association with an authoritarian regime, or forgo a much-needed chance at a star turn on the global stage?<br />Major companies are eager to get in on the action.  Visa Inc.,  Coca-Cola Co. and a host of other businesses will be represented in Beijing as “Olympic Partners,” the highest level of sponsorship available, a tier that covers several Games cycles and is reserved for those writing the biggest checks and launching the most aggressive tie-in marketing campaigns. Mars-Wrigley will be there, too, handing out Snickers, “the official chocolate of the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games.”<br />What might have seemed like a no-brainer—backing a popular sporting event in a country with 1.4 billion consumers—may turn out to be a high-risk gamble. The Olympics could mark the crescendo of a yearslong trend of some consumers, advocates and Western lawmakers pointing out what they consider the true costs of working with a country where horrifying human-rights abuses have been cataloged by journalists and U.S. officials. At a time when global companies rely more heavily than ever on the Chinese market, its government has proven easily triggered by the slightest criticism—and unafraid to exact economic punishment on those who cross it politically.<br />Already advocates are asking  Airbnb Inc.,  another Olympic Partner, why its lodging is available in a country where Uighurs in the province of Xinjiang are housed in concentration camps, subjected to forced labor and other abuses.<br />Airbnb is one of many companies that tout themselves as corporate models of social responsibility, highlighting volunteer programs and nonprofit outreach in ways that are increasingly a consideration for consumers deciding how and where to spend their money. When it comes to China, such activists say, the company appears to be less concerned.</td>

      <td>One of the Civil War’s bloodiest episodes left a lasting imprint on those who fought—and many who didn’t.</td>
      <td>“The real war will never get in the books.” Walt Whitman’s well-known prediction has not prevented thousands of writers, including Whitman himself, from trying to put the Civil War between covers. Many kinds of chronicles have been written—military histories, political studies, overviews of society or culture, portraits of leading figures. One especially striking way of bringing the war alive is to convey it from the standpoint of the unexalted individual. That is the choice John Matteson makes in “A Worse Place Than Hell,” a moving group portrait that uses the Battle of Fredericksburg, in late 1862, as the focal point for the story of five participants in the Civil War, four Northerners and one Southerner.<br />The battle that Mr. Matteson highlights has attracted a lot of scrutiny over the years, most notably in Francis Augustín O’Reilly’s “The Fredericksburg Campaign” (2003) and George C. Rable’s “Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!” (2002). These books give details of the fateful encounter near the Rappahannock River on Dec. 13, 1862, in which Army of the Potomac under Ambrose E. Burnside met resounding defeat at the hands of Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. The futile assaults by waves of Union soldiers on Confederate troops, who were protected by a stone wall on Marye’s Heights, have become a fixture of Civil War lore. On that grim winter day, the Union suffered more than 12,000 casualties, compared with some 5,300 on the Confederate side. President Lincoln put a positive spin on the battle by praising the surviving Union soldiers for their bravery. Privately, however, he confessed that the battle had left him in “a worse place than hell.”<br />Although Mr. Matteson uses Lincoln’s phrase for his title, he doesn’t dwell on the hellish aspects of the war. Instead he concentrates on personal and cultural transformation. The people he follows were profoundly changed by the war, he tells us; all of them “confronted war and struggled to redeem themselves within it.” Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the son of a famous Boston physician and author, entered the war as an idealistic man and emerged from it hard-bitten and skeptical, leading him to seek direction in a legal career. The Rev. Arthur Fuller, the brother of the women’s rights champion Margaret Fuller, served as a chaplain in a Massachusetts regiment but at Fredericksburg traded his ministerial role for a military one, taking up a gun in a burst of patriotism and losing his life to Confederate bullets. The budding author Louisa May Alcott, hoping to contribute to the Northern cause, became a volunteer nurse in a Washington war hospital, an experience that fed into her popular book “Hospital Sketches” and later provided the emotional background for “Little Women,” a fictionalized portrayal of the Civil War’s toll on her Concord, Mass., family.<br />As for Walt Whitman, he was writing poems and newspaper stories in Brooklyn and hobnobbing with bohemians when he heard that his brother George had been wounded at Fredericksburg. He traveled first to Washington and then south to the environs of the battlefield in search of his brother, whose wound, as it turned out, was not serious. Walt stayed on for several years in Washington, taking on minor government jobs while serving as a volunteer nurse in war hospitals, setting the stage for his later role as the major poet and memoirist of the war. Two of Whitman’s poems about Lincoln, “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d” and “O Captain! My Captain!,” are timeless eulogies of America’s greatest president, and his writings about the war, in poetry and prose, are at once crisply realistic and emotionally resonant. George Whitman, Walt’s brother, ended up serving in many Civil War battles and thus provides, in Mr. Matteson’s narrative, a kind of moving lens on the war as it unfolded on the battlefield.<br />In addition to these Northerners, Mr. Matteson describes the dashing John Pelham, a Confederate artillery officer who exhibited unusual courage. At Fredericksburg, partly hidden by a dip in the land, Pelham coolly supervised the firing of a cannon that was protected by its very proximity to Union troops: Their return volleys mainly went over the heads of the rebels. Pelham’s death at the Battle of Kelly’s Ford, three months after Fredericksburg, becomes in Mr. Matteson’s handling a dramatic, hopeless flourish of Confederate chivalry. Pelham charged forward on a horse like a blond god of war before being felled by an enemy shell fragment. The loss of Pelham was a blow for Confederate morale. Mr. Matteson writes: “No individual in the Confederate Army had seemed more invincible than Pelham. His risks had never been punished, and his audacity had been continually rewarded. If he could fall, so, too, might the army he left behind.”</td>

      <td>Traveling the world, a writer looks for clues to the future in the urban world of the past.</td>
      <td>Do Americans like cities?<br />Small towns? Emphatically. Suburbs? Even more so, to judge from how many people live in them. A “li’l ol’ country place” is where Mr. Blandings builds if he can.<br />There are U.S. places where the values of old Europe abide: In New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, or Boston you get a sense that the citizens love the center and would live there if there were enough room for them all. In Italy, Spain and France, civic pride springs from ancient notions of the polis and aristocratic traditions of what makes an environment noble. But the U.S. owes a lot to England, where the cult of country life outscores urban priorities. The All-American protagonist of the old TV series “Green Acres” longed for Hooterville, while his Hungarian wife pined for Park Avenue. To EU eyes, most U.S. urban neighborhoods look extemporized, undignified, hastily weatherboarded and easy to vacate. Families don’t cling to home: The pursuit of happiness scatters them.<br />When the going gets tough, Americans abandon cities with astonishing alacrity. Hence the widely scattered ghost towns: the ill-tilled gardens of Detroit; the echoing sidewalks of Gary, Ind.; the half-vanished populations of Cleveland and Youngstown, Ohio; and, in Scranton, Penn., President Biden’s haggard hometown. When factories fall, rivers shrivel or mineral veins bleed out, people move on.<br />In “Four Lost Cities: A Secret History of the Urban Age,” science journalist and fiction writer Annalee Newitz, who is reluctant to let capital determine fate, wants people to choose where to live and how to work in the land of the free. The book wavers between rival explanations for writing about why people “lose” cities. Sometimes more reasons appear for choosing city life in the first place, or for why people put so much work into doomed structures. Much attention focuses laudably on retrieving residents’ lives from middens, graffiti, and the layout of sewers, or ruts in the roads; elsewhere, the author concentrates on the misdeeds of elites that make those lives intolerable. Early on, readers learn that the book was written in refuge from—perhaps expiation for—the suicide of the writer’s estranged father. The reaction seems unusual: Most people, according to their means, might erect a monument, endow a charity, or leave flowers. But the author is a journalist, and it is no sin to labor in one’s vocation.</td>

      <td>A Ming dynasty classic of action-packed hilarity gets a fresh translation.</td>
      <td>The books that Sinologists commonly refer to as the Four Great Classics of Chinese literature are the court romance “Dream of the Red Chamber,” the sprawling military chronicle “Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” the outlaw adventure “The Water Margin” and the supernatural quest fantasy “Journey to the West,” the last of which now appears in an abridged edition from Penguin Classics in a new translation and with a fittingly playful new title, “Monkey King” (339 pages, $30). Published during the Ming dynasty in 1592, “Monkey King” is the comic relief of the quartet, a rollicking work of high buffoonery whose stature in East Asian culture, according to translator Julia Lovell, “may be compared with that of The Canterbury Tales or Don Quixote in European letters.”<br />Authorship of “Monkey King” has been ascribed to a knockabout writer-for-hire named Wu Cheng’en (ca. 1506-1582), though Ms. Lovell notes that the attribution is at best an educated guess. The outline of the story is based on the journeys of a real figure, the seventh-century monk Xuanzang, who traveled from China to India in search of sacred Buddhist scriptures. But “Monkey King” travesties the typical pilgrimage narrative by laying its focus on Xuanzang’s chief disciple and bodyguard, a shape-shifting, smart-talking, excessively pugilistic primate.<br />Monkey King (who is given the name Sun Wukong) gains his otherworldly powers at the feet of great Buddhist masters, who teach him the Way of Immortality and the 72 Transformations. Thus equipped, he claims the audacious title “The Great Sage Equal to Heaven” and bullies his way into Heaven itself, where he makes no end of mischief for the Jade Emperor and his celestial consorts. Only Gautama Buddha is able to subdue the interloper (during their confrontation, Monkey King pees on the Enlightened One) and finally pins him beneath a mountain for 500 years.<br />This is classic fish-out-of-water comedy, and the Jade Emperor is disturbed less by Monkey King’s rampages than by the fact that his presence in such distinguished settings threatens to “erode hierarchy and order.” The jokes hit every register, from slapstick and toilet humor to dryly delivered drolleries: “Now we must remind you that the Great Sage Equal to Heaven was, when all was said and done,” the author adds, “still a monkey demon.”<br />The condition of Monkey King’s release is that he provide protection to Xuanzang on his long trip to India to bring back Buddhist texts “that can release mortals from vexations, calamities, and transgressions.” They’re joined by a pig-fiend called Pigsy and a river monster called Sandy, who, Lucifer-like, were also banished from Heaven for insubordination. The novel settles into an episodic structure, with each chapter centering on the many monsters and hostile kingdoms they encounter during their travels. There are instances of heroism and moral instruction—Monkey King’s arc is redemptive—but the form is essentially, as Ms. Lovell writes, that of “an action-packed situation comedy,” with recurring gags, ridiculous challenges to overcome and a lot of cheeky crosstalk. The literary analog for the gonzo humor is Rabelais and the fight scenes are the stuff of superhero comics. But the comparison that kept coming to my mind is with the irreverent, twinkling humor of Looney Tunes cartoons, with Monkey King a cross between Bugs Bunny and the Tasmanian Devil.</td>

      <td>With many Americans still housebound, we asked major paint brands which interior shades have been experiencing the biggest growth in sales. Their answers included a surprise or two.</td>
      <td>WHEN WILLIE NELSON wrote, “Hello, Walls,” a massive country-music hit for Faron Young in 1961, he surely didn’t foresee a time when virus-spooked Americans would sequester themselves at home for months at a stretch. “I’ll bet you dread to spend / Another lonely night with me,” Mr. Nelson penned of his walls.<br />These days, of course, we’re all staring at our walls a lot. And our collective edginess seems to have affected our decision-making when it comes to choosing colors to paint them. According to Sue Wadden, director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams, the brand has been seeing strong sales growth for certain greens and blues. This isn’t entirely unpredictable, she said: Gentle shades associated with nature make us “feel grounded and connected to the space around [us]” when our lives are so uncertain.<br />Makes sense, right? But how to explain another pandemic-fueled paint-trend: a clamoring for black, as reported by a number of paint-manufacturer representatives we interviewed. While black’s growing popularity as an interior paint color might suggest that we’re mired in depression, Patrick O’Donnell, international brand ambassador at Farrow & Ball, sees it differently. While “most of us perceive black as intimidating and difficult to use,” he said, thoughtful applications of black can be soothing, especially in home offices. Farrow & Ball’s data suggests that customers are particularly responding to “more nuanced versions,” such as blueish noirs, instead of pure black. Another possible attraction? Black’s ability to complement another big pandemic trend: house plants. “Black is also a fantastic foil to planting,” Mr. O’Donnell said, “and verdant greens will really pop against this saturated backdrop.”<br />Here, five shades that saw particularly notable jumps in popularity over the past year.<br />“Black can—if used judiciously—create surprisingly calming atmospheres,” said Mr. O’Donnell at Farrow & Ball, which saw black paints, such as Farrow & Ball Off-Black No. 57, which skews a bit blue, spike in sales. Mr. O’Donnell noted black’s potential for turning a light-starved room into a cocoon, and for aiding focus of the mind in a home office, “where they are non-distracting.” From $110 a gallon, farrow-ball.com</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to wield the department’s broad powers to tackle potential risks to the financial system posed by climate change while pushing tax incentives to reduce carbon emissions.<br />Ms. Yellen is looking to a veteran of the Obama administration, Sarah Bloom Raskin, as the leading candidate for a new senior position that would head a new Treasury climate “hub,” according to people familiar with the matter. A former deputy Treasury secretary who once worked alongside Ms. Yellen on the Federal Reserve Board, Ms. Raskin has warned in interviews and speeches that U.S. regulators must do more to strengthen the financial system’s resilience to climate risks.<br />The move is part of the Biden administration’s effort across many government departments to address climate change and its impact on various industries. In two early moves, the administration rejoined the Paris climate accord and suspended new oil and gas leases on federal land.<br />“I think we need to seriously look at assessing the risk to the financial system from climate change,” Ms. Yellen said at her Senate confirmation hearing last month, calling it an “existential threat” to the U.S. economy. Ms. Yellen said the new hub would review financial stability risks and tax policy incentives related to climate change.<br />Her climate push is already facing resistance from some Republicans in Congress and financial industry officials wary of new regulatory burdens on banks after the Obama administration imposed widespread new rules following the 2008 financial crisis.</td>

Michael Jones, chief executive of Platinum Group Metals Ltd., which is developing a palladium, rhodium and platinum mine in South Africa.<br />Platinum’s comeback initially kicked off with a rebound in industrial consumption of precious metals.

      <td>Let the weather and the world do their worst. Made from scratch or from a packet, hot chocolate is always there for us. These are the ones to make and the ones to buy.</td>
      <td>THIS TIME OF year, no one needs to be reminded that they like hot chocolate—that it’s good, that it’s the antidote to the cold and the general dreariness that can permeate life come deep winter. But as we drag ourselves into pandemic year two, small comforts have assumed outsize importance. What else explains the insane viral sensation of hot chocolate bombs from a few months ago? This winter, not only do we like hot chocolate; we need it.<br />It’s an instant pick me up. It’s a chocolate bar that does not need to be chewed, just poured down your throat, warming your esophagus, your belly and, ultimately, your soul. This soothing drink is exactly the kind of harmless sedative America needs right now, the ultimate expression of self-love—or, at least, self-mercy.<br />Hot chocolate bombs aside, this winter, even regular old drinking chocolate has been a hot commodity. Matthew Caputo, co-owner of A Priori Chocolate, a Utah-based importer and distributor of dozens of craft chocolate brands, said that sales of drinking chocolates have gone up at least five times from past winters, and manufacturers are having difficulty keeping up with demand. Mr. Caputo attributed it in part to all the outdoor gatherings and activities that have extended well beyond their usual season. When we’re chilly, hot chocolate is what we crave.<br />It’s practically programmed in our DNA. Long before humans were eating chocolate, we were drinking it. “If the history of chocolate were a 24-hour cycle, glossy chocolate bars and confections would represent a few seconds,” writes chocolate and cacao scholar Maricel Presilla in “The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets.” “Cacao and chocolate beverages would account for the vast majority of a long saga that began in South America 56 centuries ago, at least 1,670 years before the Egyptians built their first step pyramid.”<br />After all this time, the love affair with drinking chocolate is going strong. In New York City, frigid temperatures and closed indoor dining did not deter customers from lining up outside the first U.S. location of Angelina, which opened last November, for a taste of the Parisian café’s famously thick chocolat chaud. “We see it all day long,” said Anthony Battaglia, Angelina’s chief operations officer. “We are selling up to 80 liters of hot chocolate a day. Our hot chocolate machine is working from 5 a.m. to 9 at night non-stop producing, producing, producing.” Due to unexpectedly high sales, the New York location had to send for reinforcements of branded disposable cups from the Paris mothership.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The White House has begun outreach to gun control advocates as it works to address President Biden’s ambitious campaign promises on an issue that has long proved politically challenging for Democrats.<br />Ahead of the anniversary of the 2018 Parkland school shooting on Sunday, Mr. Biden’s plans are receiving fresh attention. Gun policy wasn’t part of his first round of executive orders, but advocacy groups said they were encouraged by White House outreach so far.<br />Domestic policy adviser Susan Rice and White House public engagement director Cedric Richmond met virtually with gun-control groups Wednesday, stressing their commitment to taking what they called “common-sense steps.” Activists are pushing for legislative moves, including an expanded background check bill, as well as items the president could pursue without the closely divided Congress, including appointing a senior aide tasked with gun-policy oversight and pursuing stricter enforcement of existing rules.<br />“I get it. Covid should be the top priority—one through 10,” said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jamie, was killed in the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead and another 17 wounded.<br />Mr. Guttenberg was part of a call Thursday with Ms. Rice and Mr. Richmond and other Parkland families. After the 90-minute conversation, he said, “I get the impression, even with more definitive clarity, that this is something that they intend to lead on.”</td>

Latin America suffered challenges due to Covid, although Oyo’s business model is still “viable long-term,” Oyo Brazil said in an announcement Thursday.<br />in September of last year Oyo passed control of its Latin American operations to SoftBank, which was slated to invest $75 million into the unit. When Oyo decided to put less focus on the region, the pair decided that SoftBank would pull out of operations there and dismiss most of the staff on the ground, according to the Oyo Brazil announcement and an Oyo spokeswoman.<br />Oyo will continue to have a small local support crew in Latin America, and the brand will remain, but the company will provide the bulk of its services via software and technology platforms run out of other locations, said an Oyo spokeswoman. The company declined to say how many people are employed in Latin America now.</td>

      <td>ROME—Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, is set to be named Italian prime minister after persuading nearly all of the country’s squabbling parties to support his government, raising hopes that he can succeed where many others have failed: in leading Italy out of its deep economic malaise.<br />Italy’s head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, is expected to appoint Mr. Draghi and his proposed ministers later Friday or Saturday, ahead of a formal swearing-in at the weekend and a parliamentary vote of confidence early next week.<br />Mr. Draghi is set to take over Italy, the European Union’s third-biggest economy after Germany and France, at a time when it is fighting with persistently high Covid-19 contagion, an agonizingly slow vaccine rollout and restrictions on daily life that are holding the economy in recession.<br />Reviving economic growth in Italy is vital for the EU and its common currency, the euro, since Italy’s deep debts and chronically low growth are the biggest sources of doubt about the euro’s long-term stability. How to reanimate Italy’s economy, which has stagnated since the 1990s, has bedeviled a series of would-be reforming leaders who briefly carried the country’s hopes but ended as disappointments.<br />Mr. Draghi, a 73-year-old, U.S.-trained economist who has worked at the World Bank,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and Italy’s Treasury and central bank, will have at most two years to make a difference. Italian parties will return to competing for power in parliamentary elections by 2023 at the latest.</td>

ProcessMaker now has more than 120 employees and has offices in Bolivia, Colombia, the U.K. and France, Mr. Reale said.<br />Mr. Baig said Aldrich’s investment in ProcessMaker reflects the firm’s interest in companies that can capitalize on the growth of digital automation, especially workflow automation.</td>

      <td>On some days, more than half of shares changing hands in U.S. are traded outside public stock exchanges</td>
      <td>The stock market is going dark thanks to a boom in activity by individual investors and manic trading in stocks such as  GameStop Corp.<br />A record 47.2% of U.S. equity trading volume in January was executed outside public stock exchanges, up from 39.9% a year earlier, according to data from Rosenblatt Securities, a brokerage firm.<br />Before 2020, the percentage of what is known as dark trading had hovered just below 40% for years. Now, on some days, more than half the shares that change hands in the U.S. are traded on various off-exchange platforms. That happened for the first time on Dec. 23, three times in January, and again on Tuesday, when off-exchange volume hit 50.5%, an all-time high for a single day of trading, Rosenblatt data show.<br />Behind the shift is the influx of small investors, many of whom have been empowered by zero-commission trading apps and are stuck at home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Online brokerages that cater to individual investors, including Robinhood Markets Inc., send many of their customers’ orders to electronic trading firms such as Citadel Securities and  Virtu Financial Inc.  These firms typically execute small investors’ orders privately instead of routing them to public markets including the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. The investors often get slightly better price terms from Citadel Securities and Virtu than they would if their orders were sent to exchanges.<br />Some analysts worry that the shift away from on-exchange trading could erode transparency. When fewer trades take place on exchanges, there is less information publicly available about the prices that investors are willing to pay for shares. That raises the risk that traders will pay more when buying and get less when selling than they should.</td>

The tournament will continue, effectively in a bubble similar to last fall’s French Open, with a view to bringing crowds back in time for the women’s semifinals next week.<br />“I won’t waste words: today hurts.

A virus that is smarter, and faster, and more infectious.”<br />The Australian Open had been organized with some of the strictest rules of any sporting event since the pandemic began.

When money is stolen from your 401(k) account, there is less recourse and more cause for concern.<br />Federal law limits consumer liability for fraudulent credit- and debit-card charges. But there is no similar protection for retirement accounts, where many people have saved a lot more money than in bank accounts.<br />When it comes to theft from retirement accounts, 401(k) record-keepers say family members are often the perpetrators. But about three years ago, the industry noticed a rise in online theft from such accounts by strangers, said Tim Rouse, executive director of Spark Institute Inc., which represents the retirement industry. “That set off huge alarms,” he said.<br />Recent court cases, in which hundreds of thousands of dollars were allegedly stolen from three people in separate 401(k) plans, highlight the risks to workers and retirees. While record-keepers generally promise to reimburse consumers for such losses, there are no guarantees.<br />“Cyber theft from retirement accounts is a growing concern,” said Steven Silberstein, chief executive of the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which combats cyber fraud in the finance industry. With more than $20 trillion in individual retirement accounts and 401(k)-type plans, they “are relatively high-value targets,” he said.</td>

      <td>Internal Revenue Service has seen inflation-adjusted funding drop by over 20% since 2010</td>
      <td>CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS’ RESCUE PACKAGE, including a major expansion of the child tax credit, has the potential to cut child poverty in half, according to Columbia University researchers, and begin building an economic and social policy legacy for President Biden. But it has a side benefit that Democrats plan to build on in subsequent legislation: It provides the first major funding boost likely to be made permanent to the Internal Revenue Service in over a decade.<br />The CTC plan to provide a $250-$300 per child monthly benefit to families comes with a nearly $400 million one-year bump to IRS funding, ostensibly to ease the administrative burden of a major new program. It’s the first step by Democrats to revive the beleaguered IRS, which has seen inflation-adjusted funding drop by over 20% since 2010 and the elimination of over 22% of its staff. Funding and staff for enforcement activities has dropped by around 30% over the last decade, per the Congressional Budget Office. There have been previous pots of money for handling Covid-19 stimulus payments and would be again in this legislation, but those aren’t likely to be renewed, like the money for the CTC administration.<br />Democrats have seized on those figures and projections from former officials to argue that funding the IRS, particularly for enforcement, is cost-effective: According to a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report, the IRS failed to collect from around 900,000 high-income individuals who didn’t file tax returns over a three-year period, which could have resulted in nearly $46 billion in tax payments. Biden is expected to call for more money for tax enforcement in his second economic package.<br />Over the years, Republicans have called for cutting IRS funding for several reasons, including a controversy over inquiries into conservative nonprofits and the IRS’s role in administering the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans, like Sen. Mitt Romney, support an expanded child tax credit but are unlikely to support Democrats’ version.<br />FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S TWEETS  between Election Day and Jan. 8, when he was permanently suspended from Twitter due to the “risk of further incitement,” were overwhelmingly about challenging the election results, according to a new analysis by Issue One, a nonprofit that advocates reducing the role of money in politics. Trump sent more than 1500 tweets during that period, of which 60% focused on challenging the election results. Trump said the election was “rigged” 57 times, called it a “steal” or “stolen” another 57 times, and declared he “won” 25 times.  Twitter  flagged over 25% of Trump’s tweets before banning him.</td>

His lawyers are expected to also argue that the former president was exercising his First Amendment rights, not encouraging violence, when he urged his supporters to “fight” and march to the Capitol in his speech preceding the riot.<br />Mr. Trump’s lawyers are also expected to criticize Democrats’ handling of the impeachment process in the House, arguing that they deprived him of due process, including representation during those proceedings. His defense team has argued that it is unconstitutional to try a former president in the Senate, an argument that all Republican senators but six agreed with in a vote earlier this week.<br />The defense team is likely to air footage of Democrats using fiery political language as it focuses on its First Amendment defense, a person familiar with the strategy said.<br />Mr. Trump’s defense team, like the House impeachment managers, has 16 hours allotted to make its case. On Thursday, Trump adviser Jason Miller said the team plans to only use one of their two days. Mr. Schoen had initially asked for the trial to be suspended during the Jewish Sabbath from 5 p.m. Friday through Saturday, but later withdrew that request.</td>

But whether car makers can persuade buyers to ditch fossil fuels for good is still uncertain.<br />Many challenges remain for electric vehicles: not enough places to charge, limited travel range and sticker prices that are still higher than similar rides powered by conventional gasoline engines. An existing federal tax credit worth $7,500 aims to help bridge the price gap and industry representatives have said they hope to expand the benefit through new legislation.<br /></td>

      <td>Lockdowns in Britain contributed to the largest contraction of the world’s major economies in 2020</td>
      <td>LONDON—The U.K. economy recorded its biggest contraction in more than three centuries in 2020, according to official estimates, highlighting the Covid-19 pandemic’s economic toll on a country that has also suffered one of the world’s deadliest outbreaks.<br />Though the country is grappling with a new, highly contagious variant of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hopeful that a rapid vaccination drive will permit a gradual reopening of the economy in the coming months, paving the way for a rapid rebound later in the year.<br />Gross domestic product shrank 9.9% over the year as a whole, the Office for National Statistics said Friday, the largest decline among the Group of Seven advanced economies. France’s economy shrank 8.3% and Italy’s contracted 8.8%, according to provisional estimates. German GDP declined 5%.<br />The decline in U.K. GDP in 2020 was the largest in more than 300 years, according to Bank of England data, though the preliminary estimate is likely to be revised. BOE data shows the economy last recorded a comparable drop in 1921, when it shrank 9.7% during the depression that followed World War I. The economy recorded a bigger contraction, of 13%, in 1709, during an unusually cold winter known as the Great Frost.<br />Britain’s economy was hit especially hard in the second quarter of the year as a nationwide lockdown took effect. Social distancing and the closure of restaurants, bars, hotels and theaters was painful for the British economy, where a higher share of national income is spent on recreation and similar services that require face-to-face contact than in other comparable economies.</td>

Kentucky, Arkansas, and Nebraska are among 12 states that received federal approval under the Trump administration to impose work requirements, although some plans were blocked by the courts. States could try to challenge efforts by the Biden administration.<br />Politico earlier reported the Biden administration’s plan to rescind the Medicaid work requirement.</td>

      <td>Key moments and themes from Thursday’s session as House managers finished making their case</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The third day of former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial brought to a climax House managers’ case for convicting him, as they focused squarely on his actions during and after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Here are five takeaways from the trial’s third day:<br />Rep. Diana DeGette (D., Colo.) opened the day with a presentation focused on the perspectives of the rioters themselves, many of whom have said they had overrun the Capitol because they believed Mr. Trump directed them to do so. One man shown on a video stream said: “Our president wants us here. We wait and take orders from our president.” A Trump lawyer criticized Democrats for showing the videos of rioters citing the former president as a reason for assaulting the Capitol. “I think it’s offensive, quite frankly,” David Schoen told reporters. “It’s an antithesis of the healing process to continue to show the tragedy that happened here, that Donald Trump has condemned, and I think it tears at the American people, quite frankly.”<br />The Democratic managers argued that a key reason to convict Mr. Trump was to stop the same kind of violence from happening again. “We are not here to punish Donald Trump,” Ms. DeGette said. “We are here to prevent the seeds of hatred that he planted from bearing any fruit.” Rep. Ted Lieu (D., Calif.) said: “If we let him get away with it and then it comes to your state capital or it comes back here again, what are we going to say?” He added: “I’m not afraid of Donald Trump running again in four years. I’m afraid he’s going to run again and lose. Because he can do this again.”<br />Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, countered arguments made by Mr. Trump’s attorneys that the former president’s words in the lead-up to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol were “well within the norms of political speech that is protected by the First Amendment,” as they wrote in a recent brief. Mr. Raskin cited a 1969 landmark Supreme Court case in which the high court found that the government couldn’t prohibit free speech and free press “except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.” He compared Mr. Trump to a “fire chief who incites a mob to go set the theater on fire, and not only refuses to put out the fire, but encourages the mob to keep going as the blaze spreads.”<br />As the third session of the trial kicked off, several senators were hunched over their desks or leaning back. Some spent periods outside the chamber or stood watching the proceedings from the back. At one point, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) hung his head and appeared to be resting. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) switched between taking notes, fiddling with his pen and picking his fingernails. Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) was writing on a blank map of Asia. He studied what appeared to be a map of Southeast Asia during Wednesday’s proceedings.</td>

      <td>Actress Gina Carano falls victim to Hollywood’s new McCarthyism for conservatives.</td>
      <td>The Hollywood blacklist is back, baby. Actress Gina Carano lost her role this week as a co-star of the Disney+ series “The Mandalorian.” Her crime? Ill-considered social-media posts, including one that compared hatred of conservatives to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. Online mobs had previously targeted her for outré comments on mask wearing, the “preferred pronoun” fad, and fraud in the 2020 election. #FireGinaCarano trended and Lucasfilm Ltd., the  Disney  subsidiary that produces the “Star Wars” spinoff, predictably obliged. In the now-standard model of scorched-earth personal destruction, the United Talent Agency dumped Ms. Carano as well.<br />The film and television industry has come a long way on the subject of blacklists. During the McCarthy era, the director Elia Kazan gave the House Un-American Activities Committee the names of show-business colleagues he knew to be members of the Communist Party. Others, who refused to name names, were blacklisted by the studios and denied work.<br />For decades, the Hollywood bien-pensant viewed the blacklist as an unforgivable stain on the industry. In 1999 some of the biggest stars in the business sat on their hands when Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar. “Trumbo” director Jay Roach lamented in 2015 that those who’d been blacklisted “were somehow seen as traitors because they had different political views.”<br />In his review of “Guilty By Suspicion,” a 1991 film about the blacklist starring Robert De Niro, Roger Ebert wrote: “History has vindicated those who refused to betray their principles, but how would any of us have responded at the time—when to defy [HUAC] meant virtual unemployment in show business?”<br />Good question. I’m not defending Gina Carano’s posts, although they are probably defensible. I’m defending the principle. If it’s wrong for someone to lose his job because he’s a Communist, it’s wrong for someone to lose her job because she’s a conservative.</td>

The spot was featured in many news articles including The Wall Street Journal, and several TV programs aired portions of the ad, likely generating tens of millions of dollars in free publicity for Jeep.</td>

If convicted, the 33-year-old Brooklyn man faces up to 15 years in prison. Other individuals are under investigation.<br />Authorities said the warehouse was “an elaborate production assembly line” for the counterfeit masks. They also found hundreds of thousands of pieces of other personal protective equipment in the warehouse, including disinfecting wipes, children’s masks, and gowns.<br />“We are living in a horrible pandemic with more than 450,000 Americans dead from Covid-19. This defendant allegedly sold false hope and security and was set to sell more of these counterfeit masks to whomever would pay his price,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said.<br />Acting on a tip, law enforcement raided the two-story warehouse in Long Island City earlier this week, and discovered more than 100 shipping pallets “piled high with boxes of 3M-labeled N95 masks,” according to the district attorney’s office. Mr. Zeng, who pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, was present at the time.</td>

On Thursday, however, the company again demonstrated how Covid-19 has brutalized its bottom line.<br />Still, its quarter beat pessimistic Wall Street estimates, and Disney registered a profit of $17 million, or one cent a share. The blow came from Disney’s legacy businesses: Two-thirds of North American movie theaters remain closed, and Disneyland is closed to anyone who isn’t showing up for a Covid-19 vaccine shot.<br />In the comparable period a year ago, before the Covid-19 pandemic started to affect the U.S., its profit was $2.11 billion, or $1.16 a share.<br />Disney’s first-quarter profit comes after the company reported two quarterly losses in a row. But in a sign of how much has changed at the world’s largest entertainment company, Disney’s quarterly profit was about 2% of the domestic box-office gross of the company’s top-performing 2019 release, “Avengers: Endgame.”<br />With the traditional movie business hurting, Bob Chapek, approaching his first anniversary as Disney’s chief executive, reiterated the shift toward a streaming-first model.</td>

      <td>His nominee for deputy Labor secretary presided over $11.4 billion in jobless benefits fraud.</td>
      <td>Progressives like to say these days that the Biden Administration is bringing California’s values to the rest of America, and alas that seems to be true. Consider the nomination of California Labor secretary Julie Su to be deputy U.S. Labor secretary after presiding over a gargantuan unemployment benefits fraud.<br />California has paid some $120 billion in unemployment benefits during the pandemic, nearly a quarter of all payouts nationwide. That alone suggests a governance problem. Yet Ms. Su last month disclosed that $11.4 billion has gone to foreign cyber-criminals, prison inmates and other scammers. Another $19 billion in potentially fraudulent claims are under investigation.<br />Local district attorneys and the feds have in recent months brought charges against some of the thieves. They include a former labor agency employee who allegedly filed 100 phony claims in other people’s names that totalled up to $2 million. A $21,000 payment to California Sen. Dianne Feinstein tipped off local investigators but not state workers who paid the claim.<br />Fraud appears to have been pervasive in state prisons with at least one phony claim filed from each facility. Prison payments have added up to more than $800 million. At least 133 death row inmates, including the well-known convicted killer Scott Peterson, had claims filed in their names.<br />One entrepreneurial inmate gathered personal information from her fellow prisoners and shared their details with a parolee who filed claims in their names. The government lost a mere $200,000 on that scam. Unlike the Maserati that one drug trafficker used his phony benefits to buy, the government can’t confiscate the parolee's spoils. She spent it on plastic surgery.</td>

      <td>He’s a ‘patriot,’ a man of faith and courage, Democrats now say.</td>
      <td>One novel, even astonishing, spectacle in President Trump’s impeachment trial has been progressive Democrats singing the praises of Mike Pence. “The Vice President and I don’t agree on too much in politics,” Rep. Joaquin Castro told the Senate jurors Wednesday. “But he’s a man who upholds his oath, his faith, his duty, and most of all upholds the Constitution.”<br />A moment later Mr. Castro called Mr. Pence “a patriot.” Other Democrats concur. “Vice President Pence had the courage to stand against the President, tell the American public the truth, and uphold our Constitution,” said Stacey Plaskett, the delegate for the Virgin Islands. “That is patriotism.” Rep. Ted Lieu said Mr. Pence “stood his ground, like our other brave officials stood their ground.” He added: “Vice President Pence showed us what it means to be an American, what it means to show courage.”<br />Mr. Pence is probably en route to Walter Reed with symptoms of acute whiplash. For years he has been mocked as a Trump bootlicker, a religious weirdo and bigot. In a 2019 tweet directed at Mr. Pence, Mr. Lieu said he hoped “your hate of LGBTQ employees and students will one day dissipate.” On July 16, 2018, Mr. Castro tweeted: “Mike Pence @VP is a Trump zombie at this point.”<br />Recall the furor in 2015 when Mr. Pence, as Indiana’s Governor, signed a state Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Or remember the coverage of Mr. Pence’s years-ago comment that he wouldn’t go to dinner alone with a woman not his wife. Amid the pushing for a first impeachment of Mr. Trump, the media offered grave warnings that President Pence might be even worse.<br />All that is now forgotten, but don’t expect this strange new respect on the left for Mr. Pence to last. As soon as the second impeachment trial wraps, he will go back to being another dark figure in a political “Handmaid’s Tale” told to inspire fear and loathing among Democratic voters. But for everyone else, Mr. Pence’s defense of the rule of law and the Electoral College should stand as a refutation of that caricature.</td>

They have spent the past nine months in a county jail, fighting multiple court battles to avoid being sent to Japan to face criminal charges in the escape.<br />A former chief executive of Nissan Motor Co., Mr. Ghosn was facing financial crime charges in Japan and living in a court-monitored house in Tokyo when he disappeared in late 2019.

We are the United States of America. We can do this,” the president said.<br />The additional vaccines will bring the total number of doses ordered by the U.S. from the two companies to 600 million from 400 million. The administration said in January that it was working on the purchases, which would provide enough supply to vaccinate 300 million Americans in a two-dose regimen, covering all individuals in the U.S. currently eligible to receive the vaccine. The vaccine hasn’t been approved for people under 16 years old.<br />The U.S. also has supply contracts with other companies, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca PLC and  Novavax Inc.  to provide a combined 500 million doses. These vaccines have not been cleared by regulators, although J&J’s is currently under view for emergency use.</td>

      <td>Strong streaming growth has propelled stock to a record valuation, despite pandemic’s continued pain</td>
      <td>Walt  Disney Co.  has sold its streaming story well. Investors will soon need to start paying attention to the other parts of the empire, though.<br />The entertainment giant’s fiscal first-quarter results reported Thursday afternoon were essentially a repeat of its last update. Customers continue to flock to the company’s streaming offerings but much less to its theme parks and other parts of the company’s business that depend on crowds. Revenue of $16.25 billion edged the Wall Street consensus of $15.9 billion, while operating income of $29 million was nearly double the consensus forecast—even though it also diminished by 99% from the same period last year.<br />Disney’s share price still rose a further 2% after hours following the results. Investors have taken to focusing exclusively on the company’s successful streaming business. Disney+ hit 94.9 million paid subscribers by the end of the quarter—exceeding the 89.7 million expected by analysts, according to forecasts tabulated by Visible Alpha.<br />Disney managed to pick up 8.1 million subscribers in just the last month of the quarter, based on an update the company gave at its Dec. 10 analyst meeting. That alone is notable given the competition Disney faces from its growing raft of streaming competitors. The month included the launch of “Wonder Woman 1984” on HBO Max—the first of a slate of Warner Bros. films that will make their debuts on the service this year. But Disney is now supremely confident in its own streaming prospects; it used that Dec. 10 meeting to lay out targets to grow as big as  Netflix Inc.  by 2024, revving up an already excited investor base. Disney’s stock price has surged 23% since that meeting, compared to a 7% rise by the S&P 500 over the same period.<br />But streaming can’t float the full empire forever. Disney’s theme-park business has benefited in part from a fractured government response to the coronavirus pandemic; Florida allowed the company’s resort in Orlando to open at a reduced capacity in July, while California has said no to the same. As such, theme-park revenue rose 33% from the September quarter but was down 68% from the same period last year. Parks have also typically accounted for about one-quarter of the company’s operating income; domestic and international parks combined lost a little over $1 billion during the December quarter.</td>

The advocates, like Jared Bernstein of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, typically suggest it means easier money for a longer period of time.<br />Before the Fed embraces a progressive theory of social-impact monetary policy, however, it seems to be doing some due diligence. A new staff report from the New York Fed shows how a central bank focus on racial equity could make the problem worse.<br />The paper, “Monetary Policy and Racial Inequality,” looks at the asset portfolios of black and white Americans. It models the impact of Fed rate cuts on wealth and labor-market outcomes by race. If you are only focused on race gaps in the labor market, the paper finds, then easier money is modestly egalitarian: “The black unemployment rate falls by about 0.2 percentage points more than the white unemployment rate after an unexpected 100bp monetary policy shock.”<br />Yet the effect on wealth is much larger as lower rates push investors into equities seeking higher investment returns. “The same shock pushes up stock prices by as much as 5%, and house prices by over 2% over a five year period,” say the authors. Because of racial gaps in asset ownership, this translates to a 20% to 30% annual income bump for white households compared to 10% for black households.<br />That’s the Fed’s “racial equity” dilemma: Rate cuts intended to boost earnings for workers on the margins of the labor market also spur higher asset prices. After a bout of expansionary monetary policy, “the earnings gains of black households are dwarfed by the portfolio gains of white households.”</td>

      <td>Will the President restrict a useful health insurance option?</td>
      <td>The Biden team is combing the books for Trump policies to undo, and one target may be modest regulations expanding choices in health insurance. Democrats have attacked “short-term” health plans as “junk insurance,” but the evidence shows they’ve become a valuable option for millions of Americans.<br />A new paper from Brian Blase of the Galen Institute looks at how “short-term, limited duration” insurance plans have affected health-care markets since the Trump Administration expanded the option in 2018. These plans don’t have to offer the full suite of benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, and as such often cost a fraction of ACA plans.<br />The Obama Administration in 2016 capped plans at 90 days. The point was to force the young and healthy, who might otherwise be attracted to short-term plans, to pay more for coverage in the exchanges. The Trump Administration in 2018 reverted to the old standard of 364 days, with the option to renew for up to three years.<br />Nancy Pelosiaccused Mr. Trump of “railroading vulnerable families into shoddy junk health insurance plans,” never mind that anyone who preferred more comprehensive coverage could keep buying it. The real complaint is that these plans have been a refuge for those who don’t qualify for ObamaCare subsidies. The company  eHealth  said last year that the average monthly premium for plans selected by its unsubsidized customers was $456. Pair that with a deductible that can top $4,000.<br />No wonder, then, that an estimated three million Americans availed themselves of a short-term option at some point in 2019. A popular trope was that the Trump Administration was “sabotaging” ObamaCare by siphoning off healthy customers. That hasn’t happened.</td>

A hearing on the request was set for Friday morning in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn.<br />The monitor has the authority to block significant financial moves by the firm, which owns dozens of auto dealerships through its funds. The firm accepted the SEC’s proposal to install Joseph T. Gardemal III, a managing director with Alvarez & Marsal Holdings LLC in Washington, as the monitor.<br />Set up in 2013 by David Gentile, Jeffry Schneider and Jeffrey Lash, the firm was hit with civil actions by seven states and the SEC last week, while the three men were indicted on criminal fraud charges.<br />Messrs. Gentile and Lash have entered not guilty pleas while Mr. Schneider is expected to enter a plea on the criminal charges Friday. Mr. Gentile, who has denied the civil as well as criminal charges, stepped down as the firm’s chief executive last Friday until the matters are resolved.</td>

      <td>Rather than reopen classrooms, the new president coasts on his predecessor’s work.</td>
      <td>Handling a pandemic is hard work. Lucky for Joe Biden, he’s discovering his predecessor did most of the heavy lifting.<br />Mr. Biden ran on two big promises. One was national unity, which he has redefined as Republicans agreeing to his agenda. The other was to “get control of the virus that’s ruined so many lives”—enabled, he says, by the Trump administration and “the worst performance of any nation on earth.” He would do this by “finally” imposing “a plan” to get the economy running, schools open, vaccines distributed.<br />The new administration has spent every minute talking coronavirus. Yet 90% of its energy has gone to trashing its predecessor and resetting expectations, not to any sweeping policy change. Logistically, it would seem Mr. Biden inherited a fine plan after all. In the few areas where he might actually force improvement—notably reopening schools—the president has whiffed.<br />On the top priorities, vaccine production and distribution, Mr. Biden continues to pretend he had to start from scratch. This week he accused the Trump administration of misleading his team about the amount of “vaccine available.” How so? The prior administration started placing bets on vaccine candidates last summer, helping companies manufacture them before clinical trials were complete. By December, two vaccines, from  Pfizer  and Moderna, had panned out, and officials had announced that a total of 400 million doses would be delivered by summer.<br />The Biden administration has made little change to the vaccine-production plan; there’s nothing much to be done. It made hay of its early decision to order 200 million more doses. But the deal won’t accelerate the pace of production and may prove unnecessary as other vaccines become available sooner. The administration also crowed that it is invoking the Defense Production Act, ordering suppliers to prioritize Pfizer’s demand for raw materials. A good sound bite, though unnecessary. The Trump administration already provided Pfizer priority with a deal in December.</td>

      <td>From Somali Xawaash to Indian chaat masala, American cooks are embracing new combinations of aromas and flavors.</td>
      <td>When my mood turns anxious or just weary of these pandemic times, I lift my heavy granite mortar and pestle down from its shelf and grind up a new spice mix. It’s more exhilarating than a new bottle of perfume and far cheaper. It never ceases to amaze me how the whole atmosphere in the kitchen changes depending on subtle tweaks to the spice mix. Grind together some cinnamon sticks and cardamom pods and your kitchen will instantly smell of Swedish sticky buns; add a spoonful of cumin to the mix and you are eating pilaf in the Middle East. Spice mixes allow you to travel the world in an aromatic haze, which is all the more welcome now that real travel is mostly off the table.<br />One of my current favorite spice mixes is a Somali one from “In Bibi’s Kitchen: The Recipes and Stories of Grandmothers From the Eight African Countries that Touch the Indian Ocean” by Hawa Hassan with Julia Turshen, published last year. Hawa Hassan was born in Somalia, and she includes a recipe for something called Xawaash spice mix (pronounced HA-wash), which can be used for anything from pilaf to stew to roasted vegetables.<br /><br />Ms. Hassan says that every Somali cook will have their own family recipe for it. The version in the book has a sharp bite from bold quantities of black peppercorns and a warm citrusy fragrance from coriander seeds, cumin, cardamom, cinnamon stick and whole cloves. I used the spice mix to make Ms. Hassan’s recipe for chicken stew with yogurt and coconut. As we ate it, our mouths tingled to taste a dinner seasoned with a fresh perfume—fresh to us, at least, if not to millions of Somali cooks and eaters.<br />One of the untold stories of modern food is that we tend to eat so many more spices than in the past. The value of U.S. spice imports rose from $426 million in 1998 to $597 million in 2007, according to the USDA. The spice aisle of the American supermarket, with its jars of Middle Eastern za’atar and Japanese shichimi, is unrecognizable next to its equivalent a few decades ago. Garam masala from India and Chinese five-spice are now almost as easy to source as salt and pepper.</td>

      <td>An attack on wines from Australia is an attack on democracy.</td>
      <td>If you want to drink a toast to freedom, consider an Australian wine. China has taken umbrage at Australia’s criticism of its human-rights record and slammed tariffs on its wines. Among other outrageous demands, Beijing insists that Australia rein in its free press’s coverage of China.<br />Australia isn’t alone. China has sought to scare off other democracies from criticizing its regime. “If they dare to harm China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, they should beware of their eyes being poked and blinded,” a Beijing spokesman said in November.<br />These bullying tactics were honed over the past decade by threatening trade repercussions for democratic leaders (including two Danish prime ministers under whom I am proud to have served) who met with the Dalai Lama. Granting the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo put Norwegian salmon out of the China market for years. China is holding two innocent Canadians hostage as political blackmail for Canada’s following up on a U.S. extradition claim on Huawei’s chief financial officer.<br />China isn’t alone. Russia has used economic blackmail for many years, not least with its regular threats to block gas flows to Eastern Europe during wintertime. The European Union took steps to counter that blackmail through legislation and investment that empowers all EU states to act in solidarity, reverse their gas flows, and speak with one voice through the EU in negotiating gas deals.<br />There’s a lesson here: We don’t have to allow autocracies to pick off democracies one by one. The free world can and should do more, by agreeing to an “economic Article 5”—similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Article 5, which states that a military attack on one ally is considered an attack on all.</td>

      <td>A PBS ‘American Experience’ special looks at the life of contralto Marian Anderson, the first African-American soloist at the Met Opera.</td>
      <td>‘Do I still have to go through with this?” the opera singer Marian Anderson asked her manager, Sol Hurok, on the evening of April 8, 1939—the night before her now-legendary appearance at the Lincoln Memorial. A case of nerves would have been understandable, even for a seasoned performer like Anderson. But as recalled in the “American Experience” installment “Voice of Freedom,” she also knew the event was going to define her forever—just as it would define the Daughters of the American Revolution, the organization that had barred the singer from Washington’s Constitution Hall because of her race and precipitated a watershed moment in the history of the American Civil Rights movement.<br />The best moments of “Voice of Freedom” are Anderson’s—the deep throb of her contralto, the images of her performance on that Easter Sunday, warily waiting to sing for the integrated thousands jammed onto the National Mall. It is footage we have seen many times, often in short takes meant to punctuate stories about the Black experience. But seen at length it is gloriously rich, historically resonant and maybe even a little bit haunted. Whatever the filmmakers, including director Rob Rapley, did to the old film, it takes on a new life.<br />But “Voice of Freedom” isn’t just about the concert, or even about Anderson herself—her childhood of struggle; her humiliating, race-based rejection by the Philadelphia Music Academy; a Town Hall performance in New York so disastrous it might have derailed her. Or the career she enjoyed in Europe that she could never have had at home, where she remained a second-class citizen regardless of her celebrity and her talent.<br />“What I heard today one is privileged to hear only once in 100 years,” Arturo Toscanini had told the singer, after the devoutly antifascist conductor attended an Anderson performance in Salzburg, Austria, around the same time Nazis started making even the streets there perilous for people of color. Thereafter, she would be known as the “Voice of the Century,” though she would not give a dramatic, costumed performance until she broke the color barrier at the Metropolitan Opera in 1955 (in Verdi’s “Un ballo in maschera”).<br />“Voice of Freedom” is also about America in the Jim Crow era and, to an illuminating extent, about the Lincoln Memorial. The neoclassical temple had been dedicated just 17 years earlier, in 1922, in a segregated ceremony. Walter White, the executive director of the NAACP, responded by moving the Howard University-sponsored concert from verboten Constitution Hall to the memorial, making it both free and broadcast nationally—a strategy meant not just as a slap to the DAR but as a way of re-dedicating the memorial in the spirit of Lincoln. To do so he had to enlist the aid of not just first lady Eleanor Roosevelt—whose resignation from the DAR gave the event further gravitas—but also Harold Ickes, the secretary of the interior. For his part, President Franklin Roosevelt said “She can sing from the top of the Washington Monument if she wants to.”</td>

      <td>Like the 2010 ‘flash crash,’ the media overreaction will probably produce a government overreaction.</td>
      <td>Things aren’t looking good for those of us who hoped the  GameStop  frenzy would quickly give way to GameStop fatigue.<br />We have seen pretty much every take imaginable—about hedge-fund managers, trading apps and lonely men in their basements. Politicians are calling for investigations by congressional committees and regulators. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reportedly convened a meeting to discuss the matter with the leaders of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Reserve. The Journal reported on Thursday that the Justice Department—including prosecutors from the office where I used to work—has opened a criminal investigation into potential market manipulation. The CFTC has opened a parallel civil investigation and the SEC has begun reviewing social media and Reddit posts possibly intended to inflate GameStop’s stock price, potentially as part of a “pump and dump” scheme.<br />The frenzy recalls the intense media coverage of the so-called flash crash on May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered a precipitous 30-minute drop that briefly wiped out roughly a trillion dollars in value. The Washington Post invoked the episode as a cautionary tale. Politico similarly noted that GameStop “may trigger the most political attention to the mechanics of stock trading since the 2010 ‘flash crash.’ ”<br />This is probably true, but not in a way that is heartening. The U.S. government’s haphazard and deeply confused response to the flash crash—the effects of which remain with us to this day—should serve as a warning about the risks of overreaction to what should be a niche market story.<br />Like GameStop, the flash crash prompted commentary and media attention across ideological lines, as well as calls for congressional hearings and government interventions. We learned months later from the SEC and CFTC—in what remains the best account of the episode—that the cause was likely a poorly placed order from a large fund that happened to coincide with unusual market conditions.</td>

      <td>The FDA has approved only a few therapeutic drugs. Many studies suggest promising options.</td>
      <td>New Covid-19 variants are eluding antibody treatments and may render vaccines less effective. To keep up, physicians need a broader arsenal of therapies that the virus can’t easily defeat. But the Food and Drug Administration has authorized precious few treatments for Covid-19, namely Gilead’s antiviral remdesivir and monoclonal antibodies by  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  and  Eli Lilly .  The National Institutes of Health has prioritized monoclonal antibodies—essentially manufactured copies of human antibodies—which have shown promise against other diseases, including cancer.<br />The rub is that mutations that alter the shape of the spike protein on the surface of the virus—as variants from the U.K., Brazil and South Africa do—can deform the sites to which antibodies bind before they neutralize the virus. Developing new antibody cocktails that target new variants could become a game of Whac-A-Mole.<br />The good news is that Gilead says remdesivir appears effective against the new strains. It is the only FDA-approved antiviral for Covid-19, and the five-day infusion treatment is limited to hospital patients. Antivirals, which stop viruses from replicating in human cells, are typically most effective early in an illness. So finding other effective antivirals, especially ones that can be prescribed to outpatients, should be a priority.<br />Antivirals can gum up virus replication in myriad ways. Remdesivir creates a paper jam in the coronavirus’s copy machine so it can’t distribute copies of its genetic code. Scientists at the University of Texas last month published a study in the journal Molecular Cell in which they identified the key mechanism remdesivir uses to inhibit the virus’s replication. That could lead to the creation of more potent and perhaps ingestible drugs.<br />“What if you could take just one pill and that was all you needed to do?” as study co-author Kenneth Johnson was quoted in a UT press release. “That would make a huge difference in terms of the here and now.”</td>

      <td></td>
      <td><br />Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly offered her views on the outlook for the Fed’s bond-buying program and said more government aid shouldn’t cause the economy to overheat, in an interview Wednesday with Michael S. Derby of The Wall Street Journal. Ms. Daly, a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, also weighed in on how the Fed will approach climate change issues. The following transcript has been lightly edited for context and clarity.<br />MICHAEL S. DERBY: The first question I’m going to want to start off with is, as you guys have talked about the outlook, you’ve always affirmed that what happens with the economy—what happens with the economy over the next year or so—is really going to be driven by what happens with the virus. So to start out, I’m curious what your assessment is of the pace of vaccination, whether or not that process is going well and will allow the economy to do what you, what many of your colleagues expect, and that’s to pick up steam in the second half of the year.<br />MARY C. DALY: Sure. So the—you’re absolutely right. That’s certainly my view, that as goes Covid goes the economy. And when you think about that, then the vaccination schedule, getting this out, making sure it’s distributed, is the key to getting this behind us. I do see that we got off to a slow start. And that is a good reason for a healthy dose of, you know, risk assessment. And at the same time, I see it picking up momentum. So we got off to a slow start, slower than everybody wanted. But now I start to see the momentum picking up. And if we can continue that momentum and continue to build on that—get through these bottlenecks of production, and distribution, and, you know, the queuing system.<br />This is a huge logistical effort. So as we get better at it, then I think it will go more smoothly. If it goes more smoothly, then we get a chance of getting ahead of the virus. And if that happens in the time frame that I suspect it will—I’m optimistic it will, then that means by the end of summer we’ve got ourselves ready to go back to school, reengage in economic activity, and get the economy with that strong rebound that we saw for the months of last summer when we could come back outside because Covid had settled a little bit, even though it was not anywhere close to gone.</td>

      <td>Shaka King’s thrilling biopic stars Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield as Fred Hampton and the FBI informant who turned on him.</td>
      <td>Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield give a matched pair of phenomenal performances in “Judas and the Black Messiah.” Mr. Kaluuya is Fred Hampton, the controversial chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party in the late 1960s, and Mr. Stanfield is Bill O’Neal, the FBI informant who was instrumental in Hampton’s killing. The film, directed by Shaka King from a script he wrote with Will Berson, is a special sort of twofer—a powerful, and candidly sympathetic, political biography with contemporary relevance, and a morality tale set forth as an exciting action adventure. (The film is playing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max.)<br />It’s impossible to say which of the two characters is dominant. Hampton is prodigiously energetic, violent on occasion and formidably persuasive, a gifted orator who speaks at the velocity of an auctioneer—I won’t pretend I was always able to keep up—and moves his audiences with denunciations of racial injustice and promises of progress through revolutionary action. Hampton was, remarkably, only 21 when he died following an armed pre-dawn raid on his apartment. Mr. Kaluuya is not 21, and he’s English, not American, a source of concern in some circles. Yet the sheer brilliance of his portrayal sweeps away all questions except how in the world he put such a performance together. (We see Hampton listening to the speeches of Martin Luther King Jr., not only for their content but their magisterial cadences. We’re told that Mr. Kaluuya, in his turn, worked with an opera coach as part of his preparation for the role’s hurtling dialogue.)<br />The Judas of the piece, O’Neal, died in 1990; his death was ruled a suicide. In the film’s interpretation, O’Neal is a dunce politically, before and well after he meets Hampton, serves him as a Black Panther security captain and betrays him. A career car thief before infiltrating the Panthers, he had a fondness, grounded in fact, for impersonating an FBI agent, then appropriating car keys from supposed suspects. (In one of the film’s many gripping moments, a couple of Hampton’s lieutenants test O’Neal’s veracity by making him prove that he knows how to hot-wire a car.)<br />Mr. Stanfield’s quiet triumph—you won’t understand the quietude until you see it—lies in making O’Neal affecting, even fascinating, as well as unprincipled and contemptible. He’s a melancholy rat, trapped by his alliance with the FBI. You can almost see the workings of his mind as he tries frantically to grasp the magnitude of what he has signed up for. He lacks the privilege and education of Clerici, the Fascist assassin in Bernardo Bertolucci’s peerless “The Conformist,” but both men share a spiritual emptiness that can’t be filled.<br />The production surrounds its two stars with splendid actors in smaller roles. Jesse Plemons is Roy Mitchell, O’Neal’s FBI handler, a pleasant man perfectly comfortable with putting evil deeds in motion. (The film is unsparing in its depiction of a lawless FBI.) Martin Sheen is unrecognizable, and chilling, as J. Edgar Hoover, famously fearful of the rise of a Black messiah and obsessed with Hampton as the candidate at hand. Dominique Fishback plays Deborah Johnson, Hampton’s girlfriend. Ms. Fishback is appealing, in a conventional way, until she becomes absolutely enchanting in a breathtaking scene that lasts almost three minutes. That’s when Deborah, pregnant with Hampton’s child, pleads her case, with an eloquence equal to his, that life should be more than ceaseless war in the name of social justice.</td>

      <td>Patrick Page stars in a one-man show about Shakespeare’s villains; a woman undergoes surgery to restore her sight in Brian Friel’s play.</td>
      <td>On Broadway, Patrick Page usually plays bad guys, most notably the monstrous villains of “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” and “Hadestown.” Elsewhere, though, he is best known as one of America’s greatest classical actors, blessed with a bass voice so resonant that it can actually make your theater seat shake—I’ve felt it—without benefit of amplification.<br />To capture such a force of nature on a screen is no small trick, but “All the Devils Are Here: How Shakespeare Invented the Villain,” a solo show written and performed by Mr. Page and produced by Washington’s Shakespeare Theatre Company, does the job with seeming ease. Not only does it clearly convey the immense force of his stage presence, but it is also an illuminating introduction to an insufficiently appreciated aspect of Shakespeare’s genius. As Mr. Page says at the outset, “Shakespeare’s two-decade exploration of evil actually made him a more humane and sophisticated writer. In creating an entirely new kind of villain, Shakespeare rejected the prejudices of his age and became a writer for all of us.”<br />Part of what makes “All the Devils Are Here” so accessible is that Mr. Page addresses himself to the home viewer, speaking in a conversational, almost chatty way (“Do you believe in evil spirits? Do you believe in evil?”) and pointing out Shakespeare’s influence on such TV shows as “Breaking Bad” and “House of Cards.” His intended audience is clearly people who like Shakespeare but don’t necessarily know much of anything about him. But when he gets down to business and takes an 80-minute stroll through the rogue’s gallery, he sheds his populist manner like a coat and introduces us to, among others, Richard III (played with a hair-raising smile so horrific that you half expect to see fangs), Iago (whom he plays as a sociopath hiding behind the mask of sanity), Macbeth and his bloodthirsty lady, the vengeful Hamlet and Malvolio, and—yes—even Sir John Falstaff.<br />Along the way, we meet Shylock, whom Mr. Page enacts without a trace of caricature and about whose characterization he speaks with singular penetration: “Shylock is the villain of the play—but for the first time in history, he’s a villain whose motivation is so clear, whose psychology is so complex and whose language is so rich and idiosyncratic that he changes the way we experience villainy itself. Shakespeare forces us to ask ourselves: If we had been treated as Shylock was treated, might we find the same depths of wickedness in ourselves? Could we be evil?”<br />Mr. Page has no fear of the grand gesture, and here as in his stage work, his motto might well be “Go big or go home.” But what is in certain ways most remarkable about his filmed performance is that it never feels at all overdrawn. I confess to wishing that I had been listening on a sound system equipped with a subwoofer, but even on earphones you will relish his organ-pipe voice, and his physical presence all but leaps out of the screen and seizes you by the throat. Appropriately enough, he is dressed in black from top to toe, and the set on which he performs is no less uncluttered: a rug, a desk, two chairs and a coat rack. He has been very well directed for film by Alan Paul and photographed with smooth, flowing simplicity by Joey Ruffini (whose tight closeups are especially striking).</td>

      <td>Lee Isaac Chung’s semi-autobiographical film tells the story of a Korean family relocating to a farm in Arkansas.</td>
      <td><br />The most efficient review of “Minari” would be something along the lines of “It’s wonderful. See it. You’ll love it.” But you need to know more than that about Lee Isaac Chung’s partly autobiographical drama, in which a Korean family settles in Arkansas in the 1980s. This heartfelt, heart-filling celebration of putting down roots—the title refers to a resilient Korean variety of watercress—calls for gratitude and wonderment at how such an outwardly straightforward story could be so intimate, poignant, improbably funny and steadfastly stirring.<br />One clue may involve the film’s deep roots in a classic genre—all those movies and TV shows about immigrants, homegrown pioneers or impoverished Okies confronting harsh new environments where disaster can strike in the form of illness, prejudice, a tornado or a drought. Yet there’s no overt harshness here. The rural Arkansas of “Minari” seems downright congenial, at least to the paterfamilias of the piece, Jacob Yi (Steven Yeun). A chronic optimist, he has brought his wife, Monica (Yeri Han); their daughter, Anne (Noel Kate Cho); and their enchantingly quirky little son, David (Alan Kim), all the way from California, hoping for a desperately needed fresh start. (The film is playing in select theaters nationwide and will start streaming on demand on Feb. 26.)<br />Jacob’s plan seems sound enough. On a plot of land he calls “the best dirt in America,” he’ll grow Korean vegetables for increasing numbers of his compatriots coming to big cities in neighboring states. Meanwhile, he and Monica will put food on their own table with money they make sexing chicks at a nearby hatchery. We learn a lot about sexing chicks from this movie. It’s a dreary job, and the one that Jacob and Monica, born and married in Korea, had been doing in California for a dead-end decade. He’s a speedy wizard at it while she works more slowly, although, he assures her, she’s fast enough for Arkansas.<br />Whether she’s a comfortable fit for Arkansas is another matter. She is appalled by the mobile home Jacob has bought for them to live in. (Their daughter is intrigued. “Wheels!” Anne says, checking out the underpinnings.) And Monica fears the isolation—living on their own in the middle of nowhere, and far from a hospital they might need if David’s heart condition takes a turn for the worse. (“Don’t run, David,” his mother calls whenever he does, which is often.)</td>

      <td>Move, with uncertain impact in Hong Kong, comes after U.K. banned a Chinese news channel</td>
      <td>A Chinese regulator ordered the British Broadcasting Corp. off the airwaves in Chinese territory for news reports it called unfair, days after Beijing’s primary international news channel lost its license in the U.K.<br />The tit-for-tat move shows how media organizations are getting increasingly embroiled in China’s deteriorating relations with the West. London and Beijing have criticized each other’s action as hurting media freedom, depicting the news organizations involved as extensions of each government’s agenda.<br />In the mainland, China’s announcement by the National Radio and Television Administration just past midnight Friday, at the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, appeared mostly symbolic since international broadcasters such as the BBC already have extremely limited reach there. The programming typically can only be seen in upmarket hotels and compounds where foreigners live, and even on those feeds the screens frequently go black when news relates to China.<br />While the Chinese announcement ordered the BBC off the airways in Chinese territory, it wasn’t immediately clear how the ban, set to last at least a year, would affect BBC services in Hong Kong, which has a freer media environment, though Beijing has expanded limits on journalism there.<br />BBC television news remained on the air in Hong Kong early Friday. BBC has deep roots in the former British colony, where its news reports today are carried on local radio and cable TV.</td>
