      <td>Traders are bracing for big swings in stock, options markets ahead of electric-car maker’s addition to index Monday</td>
      <td>Tesla Inc.  will officially join the S&P 500 Monday, likely precipitating a frenzied Friday afternoon in markets.<br />The electric-car maker will be by far the largest firm by market value ever to join the S&P, the most widely tracked stock index. Tesla’s inclusion will prompt the dozens of index funds that track the S&P to seek to purchase tens of billions of dollars of stock at Friday’s closing price, in a bid to track the index as closely as possible. Because of the firm’s size and the volatility of its shares, Tesla’s addition may ripple through the market in additional, unpredictable ways, traders said.<br />A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices, which oversees the S&P 500, said the company consulted with market participants and communicated the addition to the market “far in advance of typical index changes.”<br />Here are five things to watch:<br />Tesla’s addition to the S&P 500 coincides with quadruple witching, which occurs four times a year and refers to the day that options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. These heavy volumes will boost liquidity and will likely help smooth the addition of Tesla to the S&P, traders have said.</td>

      <td>The Aloha State relaxed its entry regulations in the fall, but the pandemic rules are stricter than in most other states and change frequently</td>
      <td>HAWAII REMAINED a paradisiacal bubble of plumy palms and pulsing surf for much of the coronavirus pandemic. The state’s mandatory 14-day visitor quarantine, enacted March 26, all but halted tourism, curbing visitor arrival to the islands from 30,000 daily to fewer than 500. Now, nine months later, the state boasts the lowest average daily case count in the country, but it’s also suffering from the highest unemployment rate in America. After months of reopening delays, Hawaii relaxed travel rules in October to slowly restart tourism, the state’s main economic engine. If you’re tempted to jet off to the Aloha State, however, be wary. The road to Paradise comes with a few hurdles.<br />A pre-travel testing program went into effect Oct. 15, letting travelers forgo the two-week quarantine if they could provide a negative Covid-19 test within 72 hours prior to arrival. Nuances, like having to get a test from a specified provider, caused headaches and on Nov. 28, the island of Kaua`i announced it would opt out of the state’s pre-travel testing program and instead stick to a 14-day quarantine. “There is mass confusion about what is considered a valid test,” said Gary Moore, managing director of Timbers Kaua`i at Hokuala resort. “We’ve had a number of guests arrive with a negative test but it’s from the wrong provider so they need to quarantine.” Mr. Moore encourages travelers to read the fine print of the state’s ever-changing Safe Travels Program (safetravelshawaii.com) ahead of departure as some testing partners, including CVS, that were initially announced have opted out of participating.<br />On Nov. 24, the governor added another layer of complexity to travel by stipulating that visitors must have trusted test results in hand 72 hours in advance of the final leg of their trip. But given this year’s many unexpected delays—not just with flights but with test results—guarantees are in short supply. A few days before their November flight to Oahu, Don and Sheila Martinson, residents of Longmont, Colo., secured an appointment at an urgent care clinic near their home for a rapid PCR test, but the day before the test, the clinic texted to say they had run out of supplies and could not guarantee results in 72 hours. Fortunately, the couple also scheduled a backup test at a nearby  Walgreens  and received results within four hours. Despite the hassles, tourists are trickling into the islands. Between Oct. 15 and Nov. 30, more than 443,000 people came to Hawaii.<br />Before flying, travelers must upload a PDF of their Covid test results to Hawaii’s Safe Travels portal and take a health questionnaire. Once it’s completed, travelers are emailed or texted a QR code which is scanned at the airport upon arrival and at hotels. And since every island has slightly different requirements in place, visitors might want to constrain their vacation to one island.<br />Visitors should be prepared to face pandemic rules stricter than most states’ are. Violators of the statewide mask mandate risk a fine up to $5,000 or a year in jail, tricky since the details of the mandate itself change frequently. The most current regulations require everyone to wear a mask when walking to or from the beach or pool, as well as on hiking trails, at parks, on the sidewalks and in some instances, on guided outrigger canoe excursions.</td>

      <td>Some argue educators should be among the first in line after front-line health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities</td>
      <td>Coronavirus vaccines rolled out across the nation this week for front-line health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. Teachers and school staff are vying for one of the first spots in line behind them.<br />Some stakeholders, ranging from teachers to state representatives to governors, have pushed to give priority to educators for coronavirus vaccines as the pandemic destabilizes education for more than 50 million children and their families. School staff are a portion of the 87 million essential workers—including grocers, farmworkers, taxi drivers, firefighters, meatpacking factory workers and aviation employees—who may be next in line for the vaccine. Leaders across these industries have lobbied for prioritization.<br />Advocates for educators hope earlier vaccine access could increase chances of returning to face-to-face learning without the roller coaster of reopening and reclosing for many districts, and bolster safety for school personnel thrust into these essential roles. Schools are indispensable to the economy, they argue, as remote learning created hurdles for the labor market and working parents, with women feeling it most. The education and well-being of children, particularly those students who are most vulnerable, should be top of mind, they say.<br />“By taking myself out of the equation as a vector of transmission, then I feel like we’re going to have a healthier classroom and better attendance,” said Sommer Lyons, a pre-K teacher at McKinley Elementary School in Tulsa, Okla. “Kids do better when we serve them in person.”<br />Federal guidelines could arrive this Sunday when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations for the next set of vaccine prioritizations. The committee will suggest the next phases of distribution—Phase 1b and Phase 1c after front-line health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. The group has so far proposed essential workers under Phase 1b, with high-risk adults following.</td>

He said he and the second lady were “more than happy to step forward to take this safe and effective coronavirus vaccine.”<br />The first U.S. Covid-19 vaccinations began Monday, in the most urgent mass-immunization campaign since the 1950s. By Sunday, the U.S. government is expected to have completed distribution of an initial 2.9 million doses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week authorized the use of the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  and is expected to grant emergency-use authorization of a second vaccine, from  Moderna Inc.,  by late Friday.<br />About 40 million doses are expected to be available this month, and the federal government has said they should go to a priority group of health-care workers and nursing-home residents, who are considered at highest risk of exposure or illness. Together, they number about 24 million.</td>

Previously, Sinopharm said it had inoculated nearly one million people and local health community centers in China began offering ways for people to sign up for shots.<br />Authorities in the United Arab Emirates, where Sinopharm’s vaccines have been undergoing late-stage clinical trial, have said that one of the firm’s vaccine strains is 86% effective. But neither the U.A.E. nor Sinopharm have released details on how researchers arrived at the estimate.</td>

      <td>A head coach hits a history-making mark amid a pandemic-disrupted season</td>
      <td>The first victory? Tara VanDerveer remembers the essential details. The year was 1978, VanDerveer’s inaugural season on the sideline as the head coach of the University of Idaho women’s basketball team. It was a close contest, versus Northern Montana, but as the clock wound down, VanDerveer grew confident they’d win. She instructed her team to play good defense, and importantly, not to foul.<br />“And they went out and fouled,” VanDerveer said, dryly. “I just said, ‘This is going to be harder than it looks.’ ”<br />Idaho still hung on for a 70-68 victory. In the 40-plus seasons since, teams coached by VanDerveer would collect 1,098 more wins, making VanDerveer—now in her 35th season at Stanford after two at Idaho and five at Ohio State—the winningest coach in women’s college basketball history. No. 1,099 arrived Tuesday with a Stanford triumph over the University of the Pacific, giving the 67-year-old VanDerveer the record, one win above her late coaching rival, the Tennessee Volunteers legend Pat Summitt.<br />This commenced a wide celebration of VanDerveer’s career, a low-key but brilliantly steady run which includes a pair of national championships in 1990 and 1992 and a gold medal as the head coach of Team USA in 1996. NBA star Steph Curry sent in a congratulatory video message. (“I’m sure there’s more to come,” he said.) Former Cardinal Chiney Ogwumike, the 2014 WNBA Rookie of the Year, assembled a warm tribute on ESPN’s “SportsCenter” featuring shout-outs from Billie Jean King and Condoleezza Rice. (Ogwumike also sent cupcakes.)<br />“I’ve gotten an incredible number of messages, texts, emails and phone calls,” VanDerveer told me. She was trying to respond to each, but “it’s overwhelming.”</td>

Universal’s stable also includes classic acts such as Queen and the Beatles, and it recently boughtBob Dylan’s entire publishing catalog.<br />The purchase comes nearly a year after the Tencent-led consortium, which includes its streaming business  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  and other undisclosed investors, first bought a 10% stake in Universal. That deal included an option to buy an additional stake of up to 10% at the same valuation.<br />Tencent and Vivendi also signed a separate agreement in March enabling Tencent Music to acquire a minority stake in the Universal subsidiary that owns the record label’s Greater China operations.</td>

Next month, the defending Tour champions will likely become the first team in major professional sports to be vaccinated against Covid-19.<br />At the invitation of Emirati authorities, the squad’s 100 or so cyclists and support staff will receive the Chinese Sinopharm shot when they touch down in Abu Dhabi for a training camp on Jan. 6, the team said. The vaccine became widely available in the country after completing its Phase III trial there earlier this month.<br />“We’re fortunate to be considered a relatively high priority team in terms of the UAE,” said Jeroen Swart, the team’s head of medicine.<br />How a multinational squad of noncitizen, nonresident athletes fell into the queue for a Chinese vaccine in the UAE is a uniquely modern story of globalized sports—and one that raises the possibility of “vaccine tourism” for those who can afford to travel to countries where inoculation is further along.</td>

      <td>After the 2008 crisis, households and firms spent years rebuilding their finances in what economist Richard Koo dubbed a “balance-sheet recession.” Debt levels have jumped again this time round, but on closer reading, the books tell a more positive story.<br />Due to Covid-19, the borrowings of U.S. nonfinancial companies were 8.5% higher at the end of September than a year earlier, when they were already above the 2009 peak both in absolute levels and as a percentage of gross domestic product. Some publicly-backed programs won’t need to be paid back in full, but many investors are still worried.<br />They can afford to relax. Balance sheets are about assets as well as liabilities.<br />Flow-of-funds data recently published by the Federal Reserve shows that companies have accumulated even more cash than debt this year: Their liquid assets were up 25% in the third quarter. On a net basis, debt was down 7.9%. Relative to GDP, it remains well below 2007 levels.<br />Back then, companies and families started a long process of deleveraging that slowed the economic recovery. In the U.S., it took nine years for households to consistently increase their net debt again.</td>

      <td>The beginning of winter will be miserable for the U.S. economy, but things could be looking much brighter by March</td>
      <td>With a worsening Covid-19 crisis sending a new wave of caution across the country, the beginning of winter will be a dark time for the U.S. economy. But by the time winter draws to a close, it could be rebounding more swiftly than seems imaginable.<br />Economists trying to forecast what the first quarter will look like have a seemingly impossible task. First, they need some sense how bad this latest surge in Covid cases might get. Second, they need to know what measures people and state and local governments will take in response and how that might affect spending. Third, they need to weigh how much relief will be coming from the federal government. Finally, and most hopefully, they need to consider how much better things will look toward the end of the quarter as the weather improves and the vaccine rollout gains steam.<br />Most forecasters believe growth will be weaker in the first quarter than in the current quarter and that gross domestic product will remain significantly below its year-earlier level. But with so many moving parts to consider, some are looking for only a modest slowdown while others believe that GDP will register a contraction, sending the economy into a double dip recession.<br />What might actually be more important is not what the first-quarter GDP reading—an average of the economy’s performance in the first three months of the year—looks like, but the economy’s trajectory over the course of the quarter. On that point it is possible to hazard a guess: Really bad, and then really good.<br />Really bad, because of what is happening with Covid. Over the week ended Wednesday, 1.51 million new cases of Covid had been confirmed in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University, which was nearly twice as many as in the first week of November. And 17,988 people died from the disease, making it the pandemic’s most deadly period.</td>

      <td>The vaccine can be more easily shipped and handled than Pfizer’s, helping smaller hospitals and rural areas overcome logistical hurdles</td>
      <td>Health officials across the U.S. are counting on the arrival of a second Covid-19 vaccine to boost scarce supplies and sidestep logistical issues encountered by the first vaccine, which began distribution this week.<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration may issue an emergency authorization for a vaccine from  Moderna Inc.  as early as Friday after an advisory panel recommended the agency approve its use. If authorized, Moderna’s vaccine will join a vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  that received authorization on Dec. 11.<br />The green light would nearly double this month’s expected U.S. supply of Covid-19 vaccine doses and help meet a federal goal of getting a vaccine to anyone who wants one by the spring or summer of 2021. Moderna expects to add 20 million doses of its vaccine to Pfizer’s expected U.S. supply of 25 million in December.<br />“The addition of the Moderna vaccine to the response will be huge,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, whose members direct state vaccination efforts. Not only will the Moderna vaccine boost the supply of doses, but also it will “be much easier to send [it] to smaller providers and rural areas,” she said.<br />Moderna’s vaccine has easier storage and handling requirements and will be shipped in smaller quantities, health officials say. It can be stored in most standard medical freezers, while Pfizer’s must be shipped and kept at ultracold temperatures requiring either specialized freezers or dry ice, resources more common in large hospital systems and urban areas.</td>

The designation restricts companies from exporting U.S.-origin technology to the listed firms without a license, with a provision that effectively prohibits SMIC from acquiring technology to build chips with 10-nanometer circuits and smaller, the industry’s top class of chips.<br />The move raises the pressure significantly on the chip maker, a national champion that has received billions of dollars in state backing and is central to Beijing’s drive to improve the country’s self-sufficiency in critical technologies. It comes during the waning weeks of the Trump administration and follows a string of actions against Chinese tech companies.<br />Two days ago, the chip manufacturer said it was looking into reports that one of its two co-chief executives had suddenly decided to step down, a disclosure that sent its shares tumbling.<br />Commerce Department officials said they applied the restriction on SMIC because of what they said was the company’s cooperation with Chinese military-linked entities. The Trump administration has grown more concerned about Beijing’s practice of leaning on civilian companies to advance its military goals, an effort known as military-civil fusion.</td>

      <td>President Trump’s recent executive order prohibiting Americans from investing in companies tied to China’s military complex has set up a fight in the highest ranks of government over how broad the list should be.<br />Since November, the White House barred U.S. investors from buying into 35 Chinese companies the Pentagon has classified as aiding China’s defense, intelligence and security apparatus. It sparked selloffs of Chinese stocks and bonds, forced index firms to drop companies from marquee benchmarks, and pushed Wall Street to reassess risks from investing in China.<br />Now, the U.S. government is at odds over whether the blacklist should include subsidiaries of the companies. Another battlefront is over whether affiliates should be included. The question affects how much teeth the ban will have.<br />State Department and some Defense Department officials want the executive order to have the widest reach, said people familiar with the matter. They are arguing that excluding subsidiaries or affiliates creates a loophole and ignores the reality of capital markets, some of the people said. Most Chinese companies, especially state-owned firms, tend to list their subsidiaries and affiliates on the stock market, and may issue bonds through these or other units.<br />Treasury wants the blacklist to only include the companies specifically flagged by the Pentagon, and not affiliates or subsidiaries, the people familiar with the matter said. That is a view generally embraced by many on Wall Street given the fear that a broad list could spook markets and prompt large amounts of forced selling to scrub portfolios of problematic stocks.</td>

The policy was intended to establish continuity requirements and applies to leadership and staff across all branches of government.<br />“The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership,” Mr. Ullyot said.</td>

      <td>Democrats are blocking Covid relief to keep 13(3) pandemic lending alive.</td>
      <td>The Covid relief talks drag on in Congress, with the parties more or less agreeing to spend $900 billion more over a mere three months. But they’re still fighting over the details, and a major obstacle is the Democratic desire to use the Federal Reserve next year to channel tens of billions of dollars or more to state and local governments.<br />The fight behind the scenes concerns the money and authority for the Fed’s 13(3) pandemic lending facilities. Senate Republicans, led by Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey, want to repurpose some $429 billion in Cares Act money to finance roughly half of the new spending. The Fed made only $25 billion in loans and other commitments because most businesses and municipalities could borrow more cheaply in the private market.<br />Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has agreed to return the unused funds to Treasury at Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s request. Though the Cares Act clearly called for the programs to end on Dec. 31, Democrats insist that the Biden Treasury could revive the programs and renew lending. That’s why Mr. Toomey also wants the bill to include language that leaves no doubt that the programs end on Dec. 31. The Biden Treasury would then need a new appropriation from Congress to revive the programs.<br />That Democrats are opposing the Toomey language gives away that their plan is to use the Fed to go around Congress if they don’t control the Senate next year. They’re afraid a GOP Senate won’t agree to another spending blowout to rescue profligate states like Illinois and New Jersey. They want to use the Fed’s municipal and state lending facility, which was stood up this year at the height of the pandemic and market disruption, as the bailout vehicle.<br />Even if the $429 billion that was turned over to Treasury is earmarked for other Covid relief, the Fed still retains some $35 billion to $40 billion as a backstop for its special pandemic facilities. That could be leveraged as much as 10 times to lend to states and cities at terms the Biden Treasury and Fed would set. That’s all the more reason for Republicans to hold firm on Mr. Toomey’s language ending the programs.</td>

But the court, noting that the order was soon to expire, said the school could raise new objections if restrictions are reinstated in the future.<br />Two justices, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, dissented from the unsigned order, arguing that the court should have set aside an appeals-court decision allowing Democratic Gov.

The bank said in August it was investigating irregularities affecting data for four countries: China, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The manipulated data were used in the 2017 report for China and in the 2019 report for the other three countries.<br />The Doing Business report has become a premier international ranking of countries’ business environments, motivating governments around the world to jockey for higher positions to attract foreign businesses. The rankings are based on measures such as the ease of starting a business, tax policies and access to credit. In the latest report, issued last year, New Zealand is ranked No. 1 among 190 countries for ease of doing business.<br />The World Bank’s audit found that out of the 15 employees on the report’s production team, nine said they had been directly or indirectly pressured to manipulate data while preparing the reports issued in 2017 and 2019. The employees said they didn’t initially escalate their concerns about the pressure they encountered due to fear of retaliation, according to the audit report.<br />After correcting for irregularities, for example, China’s global ranking in the report issued in October 2017 would decline seven points to No. 85 from the 78th slot it was awarded initially.</td>

But as that deadline neared, negotiators said they might pass a short-term spending patch to tide the government over until the relief package is finalized.<br />“I continue to appreciate our productive discussions, but I hope we remember just how urgent this situation is for millions and millions of our fellow citizens,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Thursday. “We’re going to stay right here until we’re finished, even if that means working through the weekend, which is highly likely.”</td>

The company’s sleek technology makes trading visually appealing and encourages users to speculate although Robinhood says most of its customers aren’t active day traders.<br />According to the SEC, Robinhood failed until 2018 to fully reveal on its website how it makes money from its deals with speedy trading firms such as Citadel Securities and  Virtu Financial Inc.  Robinhood and other retail brokerage firms generate revenue by routing customers’ orders to high-speed traders, which pay for the right to execute many of the trades.<br />The practice, known as payment for order flow, can create a conflict of interest for brokers like Robinhood because of the incentive to maximize the broker’s revenues rather than ensure customers get a good price on their trades.</td>

      <td>Next year’s Pentagon budget will total about $700 billion, but Congress could harm America’s defense against China if it misallocates some $100 million for missiles in the looming military appropriations bill.<br />How can such a small line-item make such a big difference? The answer has to do with U.S. strategy for great-power competition in the Pacific. China has developed an arsenal of thousands of ground-launched precision missiles especially along its eastern coastline. Beijing wants to use these to limit the U.S. Navy’s ability to operate, including if it decided to invade Taiwan.<br />The U.S. for decades has been banned from developing the same capabilities that China has under a 1987 treaty with the Soviet Union. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), banned all ground-launched missiles—nuclear or conventional—that can travel 500 to 5,500 kilometers. America’s precision fires can only be launched from planes or ships, making them far more expensive to deploy.<br />In 2019 the Trump Administration withdrew from the INF after it confirmed Russia’s repeated violations. This year the U.S. Marine commander, Gen. David Berger, asked for $125 million in 2021 to procure 48 ground-launched Tomahawk missiles. That’s part of his long-term strategy to make Marine units more lean and mobile to survive protracted island warfare with a sophisticated military like China’s.<br />Yet the House version of the Defense Appropriations Act proposes to give Gen. Berger $62.5 million for half as many Tomahawks. The Senate version appropriates nothing. Both houses also cut his proposed missile research and development budget.</td>

      <td>A new study reports less suicide among children with education options.</td>
      <td>Teachers unions have pushed to shut down schools during the pandemic no matter the clear harm to children, just as they oppose charters and vouchers. Now comes a timely study suggesting school choice improves student mental health.<br />Several studies have found that school choice reduces arrests and that private-school students experience less bullying. One reason is that charter and private schools enforce stricter discipline than traditional public schools. Choice programs also allow parents to pull their kids out of public schools if they are struggling and send them to schools that are safer or a better cultural fit.<br />The new study in the journal “School Effectiveness and School Improvement” is the first to examine the link between school choice and mental health. The Cato Institute’s Corey DeAngelis and Western Carolina University economist Angela Dills analyze the correlation between adolescent suicide rates and the enactment of private-school voucher and charter programs over the last several decades.<br />They find that states that enacted charter school laws witnessed a 10% decrease in suicide rates among 15- to 19-year-olds. Private-school voucher laws were also associated with fewer suicides, though the change was not statistically significant. The effect would likely be larger if more students received vouchers.<br />The researchers also looked for any correlation between students who attended private school as teenagers and their mental health as adults. After controlling for socioeconomic factors, individuals who attended private schools were two percentage-points less likely to report a mental health condition when they were roughly 30 years old.</td>

      <td>The late spy novelist wrote so realistically about espionage that even intelligence agents picked up lingo from his books</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />When the British spy novelist John Le Carré died last Saturday, many obituaries noted how his gripping tales of Cold War espionage were informed by his own experiences in the U.K. intelligence agency MI5. His firsthand knowledge of spycraft provided verisimilitude for those bestselling works, beginning with “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold” in 1963.<br />That verisimilitude extended to the jargon of spying in his novels, which had the ring of truth. But in fact, Le Carré would often make up his own terms. As he revealed to a BBC interviewer in 1976, “I’ve used some authentic words, but I prefer my own really.” Those Le Carré-isms include “scalphunter,” “honey-trap,” “lamplighter” and “pavement artist.”<br />In that same interview, Le Carré was asked about one term that became particularly prominent after he used it in “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” in 1974: “mole,” for a double agent who penetrates an organization and spies on it from the inside. “A mole is, I think, a genuine KGB term, for somebody who burrows into the fabric of bourgeois society and undermines it from within,” Le Carré said. As it turns out, aside from a nickname for one Russian agent decades earlier, “mole” was not in common use by either Western or Soviet intelligence until it became popularized in Le Carré’s novels and adaptations.<br />Going back to Middle English, “mole” has referred to a small burrowing animal. The exact origin is uncertain, but it is likely related to other Germanic words like “mold” meaning “loose earth.” One early name for the animal was “moldwarp,” which literally means “earth thrower,” and “mole” may have originated as a shortened form of that.</td>

      <td>Liberalizing agriculture is politically difficult but economically crucial for India.</td>
      <td>For weeks India has been consumed by protests against agriculture reform. This is perhaps Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s toughest political challenge, but millions of lives could be improved if he holds the line.<br />In September Mr. Modi’s government passed three bills reforming the country’s statist system for agriculture. The legislation most notably ends the monopoly of government-controlled market yards, where farmers sell crops through middlemen instead of directly to private buyers. It also eliminates rules limiting grain storage that have hamstrung investment in agriculture.<br />Yet reform was always going to prompt a backlash given how many farmers survive under the old system. More than half of India’s workforce makes a living through agriculture, compared with about a quarter of Chinese and less than 2% of Americans. Millions inevitably will have to leave the farms as India develops, but leftist rhetoric about powerful and evil corporations still has some appeal.<br />The government’s heavy-handed response to protests hasn’t reduced tension, though it is doing a better job of reaching out lately. The legislation moved rapidly and with little consultation, but these changes have been discussed in India for decades. The major 1991 economic reforms also passed relatively quickly and led to sustained growth and improved livelihoods.<br />The changes will draw much-needed investment and make India a more competitive food exporter, but more needs to be done. Fertilizer and electricity subsidies damage the environment and push farmers to produce inefficient crops. The government’s minimum support price will continue along with government purchases. Eventually these statist relics will have to go as well.</td>

      <td>FedEx Corp.  isn’t missing  Amazon.com Inc.  this holiday season.<br />Shipping volumes at FedEx’s Ground unit surged 29% in the latest quarter, as consumers continued to buy everyday goods online, while retailers urged them to do their holiday shopping earlier than normal against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The combination of factors boosted revenue and profits at the delivery company for the three months ended Nov. 30, which included Black Friday. FedEx has raised prices and handled a surge in e-commerce packages this year, even after it publicly split ways in 2019 with Amazon, the biggest online retailer.<br />FedEx has found more than enough packages to fill its network after parting ways with Amazon, helped by the overall growth of e-commerce during the pandemic and courting of new customers. Online sales rose 33% in the first nine months of 2020, FedEx said, compared with just a 1% gain in overall retail sales, excluding categories such as gas and food services.<br />FedEx’s large Express unit posted a 10% jump in volume from a year ago. It continues to benefit from tight capacity in the air-cargo market, as a severe decline in passenger flights that carried freight in their bellies has cut into supply. Air-cargo companies such as FedEx have been flying fuller jets and charging higher rates as a result.</td>

      <td>How my friend Jan Nowak earned a statue in Warsaw.</td>
      <td>A reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement described a book as being “replete with derring-do.” There’s a word you don’t hear much. The book by Sarah Wheeler, “Storms,” is about men who were shipwrecked on an uninhabited island south of New Zealand. Derring-do helped them survive a terrible ordeal.<br />The Oxford English Dictionary defines derring-do as “daring action or feats.” I’ve never committed a deed of derring-do, perhaps because I didn’t serve in the military. But I got to know Jan Nowak (1914-2005), a man whose World War II derring-do on behalf of the Polish Home Army earned him a bronze statue in Warsaw. In “A Courier From Warsaw,” a powerful and disturbing memoir, Nowak recounts his many daring actions. Zbigniew Brzezinski called the book “a gripping account of personal heroism.”<br />Serving as a liaison between the Polish underground and the Allies, Nowak made five secret missions from Warsaw to the West. “Employing many disguises, Nowak traveled in secret to Scandinavia, Britain, North Africa and even across Nazi Germany itself to Switzerland and France,” Brzezinski wrote. “He . . . was usually a step ahead of the Gestapo. . . . He was involved in adventures which read like a film scenario.”<br />Though Nowak avoided arrest, his memoir is mainly about failure. He failed to persuade British authorities that the Nazis were committing genocide. “The murder of three million people organized like a factory on a kind of conveyor-belt principle was beyond the ordinary human imagination.” A Jewish emissary from Warsaw committed suicide because world-wide Jewish organizations didn’t believe his account.<br />“A Courier From Warsaw” is also about the failure of the Warsaw Uprising, in which Nowak participated, and Poland’s subjugation by communism after the war.</td>

      <td>Union leaders should stay neutral in a member vote.</td>
      <td>Christmas came early for members of the United Auto Workers. After a five-year federal corruption investigation, the union reached a settlement with the Justice Department that gives the rank and file an opportunity for real reform.<br />The deal ends a sweeping federal investigation first made public in 2017. From 2009 to 2018, prosecutors say, the union’s top leadership embezzled millions of dollars to fund lavish lifestyles, including resort stays, golf outings, top-shelf liquor and cigars. One UAW president used interest earned on the union’s strike fund to build a vacation cabin in northern Michigan, according to reporting by the Detroit News. He used nonunion labor.<br />The feds detailed coverups and bribery attempts in an effort to keep these crimes quiet. In all 15 high-ranking union and  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  officials have pleaded guilty to related charges, including two past UAW presidents, Dennis Williams and Gary Jones.<br />U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider, who led the investigation, said the lack of democracy is at the core of the UAW’s problems. For 70 years, the union’s leaders were picked by influential insiders known as the Reuther Caucus and rubber-stamped by delegates at the union’s convention. That’s how Mr. Jones was able to succeed Mr. Williams. Both were convicted earlier this year. Mr. Jones pleaded guilty to embezzlement, racketeering and tax evasion. Mr. Williams pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement.<br />Mr. Schneider and the union’s current president, Rory Gamble, agreed on six years of oversight by a court-appointed monitor, at members’ expense. The monitor won’t have any part in the union’s collective-bargaining agreements but will have the power to investigate and discipline corrupt officials. The arrangement could be extended if corruption concerns persist.</td>

      <td>The Israel-Morocco peace deal underscores a double standard on the West Bank versus Western Sahara.</td>
      <td>Many expected the Trump administration to recognize Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank before Inauguration Day. Instead, last week it recognized Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara as part of a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Jerusalem and Rabat. The new U.S. position on Morocco’s borders has a sound basis in international law and diplomatic practice, and it makes the case even stronger for doing the same with Israel and the West Bank.<br />Morocco took control of Western Sahara in 1975. The territory had been a Spanish colony, but when Madrid abandoned it, Mauritania and Morocco invaded. Hundreds of thousands of Moroccan settlers followed.<br />The United Nations has described Morocco’s presence as an “occupation,” but much of the international community has taken a more ambiguous view, describing the territory as “disputed.” The Polisario Front, a Saharawi rebel movement, also claims the territory. In 2016 U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon apologized after referring to the territory as “occupied,” in what the U.N. described as an accident.<br />Traditionally, the law of occupation applies only to sovereign territory of foreign states. This covers most cross-border conflicts but not some post-colonial transitions where there is a gap in sovereign control. Thus, while the international community strongly opposed Indonesia’s 1975 takeover of East Timor (a similarly orphaned former Portuguese colony), it didn’t treat it as an occupation. Indonesia’s 1962 takeover of the former Dutch New Guinea gained universal acceptance.<br />When Israel took the West Bank in 1967, it wasn’t the territory of a foreign country. The West Bank had itself been occupied by Jordan in 1948, at the end of British administration. The U.N. and much of the international community hasn’t been shy about using the term “occupation” to describe Israel’s presence. Yet Israel’s territorial claim on the West Bank is stronger than Morocco’s claim on Western Sahara.</td>

      <td>The Canadian author Robertson Davies was a master of the Yuletide ghost story.</td>
      <td>When Robertson Davies became the head of Toronto’s newly founded Massey College in 1963, he wanted to develop a set of customs for his school. A project he picked for himself involved the annual Christmas party: He would compose a ghost story and read it to the guests. He did this for 18 years.<br />Had he mixed up his holidays? Christmas is the celebration of a birth. Ghost stories depend on death. They’re supposed to be spooky—more suited to Halloween.<br />Davies (1913-95) was one of Canada’s most acclaimed novelists, and he drew from the same tradition that inspired Charles Dickens to put ghosts in “A Christmas Carol.” The age-old connection between Christmas and accounts of apparitions probably owes something to how the season’s long nights stir visions of specters. That may be what Shakespeare was getting at in “A Winter’s Tale,” in which a prince proclaims: “A sad tale’s best for winter: I have one / Of sprites and goblins.”<br />Davies had another source, too. In the 1890s, Cambridge scholar M.R. James began to write ghost stories. He read them by candlelight to small audiences of professors and students at Christmas. One of his listeners was Paul Mathews, Davies’s future father-in-law.<br />Today James is widely hailed as the master of the classic English ghost story. Whereas he designed his brief tales to deliver a climactic shock, Davies pursued a different purpose. “It was never my intention to frighten anyone,” the Canadian wrote in the introduction to “High Spirits,” a collection of his ghost stories. The title is a pun: Its phantoms contribute to comic situations rather than haunting ones.</td>

      <td>A memoir of a lifetime’s active engagement with American theater, by a former drama critic for The Wall Street Journal.</td>
      <td>As a schoolboy in the early 1940s, Edwin Wilson saw Al Jolson drop to his knees in the footlights of the Shubert Theatre and belt out “Mammy.” As a young man he thrilled to the original Broadway productions of “A Streetcar Named Desire,” “Death of a Salesman,” “Oklahoma!”—the standard American repertoire aborning. In his memoir “Magic Time,” Mr. Wilson, now 93, writes fondly of how these and other electrifying moments of New York playgoing led him, circuitously, to Yale Drama School and a lifetime of teaching and making theater happen—writing scripts, directing and producing plays, encouraging young talent, and writing or cowriting three of the most enduring college theater textbooks. At the heart of the book, however, is an account of his long tenure as The Wall Street Journal’s theater critic, from 1972 to 1994. It was work that, with its first-night tickets and aisle seats, returned him to what drew him to the dramatic arts in the first place—an audience member’s experience of living theater. More than a reminiscence, “Magic Time” is also a mini-anthology of Mr. Wilson’s favorite reviews and other writings for this paper. The critic excelled at profiles, interviews and memorial tributes, four of which are adapted here.<br /><br />On composer Richard Rodgers, who died at 77 in 1979: For the first 22 years of his professional life, Rodgers collaborated with Lorenz Hart. With Hart, he always wrote the music first, spinning out a waltz, a ballad or a patter song, then Hart would add his intricate, urbane lyrics: “We’ll go to Greenwich / where modern men itch / to be free.” When Hart, due to personal problems, could no longer serve as his lyricist, Rodgers turned to Oscar Hammerstein II, and began a second remarkable collaboration. Beginning with “Oklahoma!” in 1943, Rodgers and Hammerstein turned out hit shows year after year: “Carousel,” “South Pacific,” “The King and I,” “The Sound of Music.” Where Hart’s lyrics had been sophisticated, often bittersweet, Hammerstein’s were sincere, straightforward and sometimes even overly sentimental. But Rodgers adjusted: his music took on a warmer, down-to-earth quality. He even changed his composing habits; instead of writing the music first, he set his tunes to Hammerstein’s completed lyrics. Through all of these changes one thing remained constant: Rodgers’s great gift for melody and his solid musicianship. Alec Wilder, whose book “American Popular Song” is probably the definitive study of the subject, made a detailed analysis of more than a hundred Rodgers tunes. Afterward he wrote: “I am more than impressed and respectful: I am astonished.” His songs, Mr. Wilder said, “revealed a higher degree of excellence, inventiveness and sophistication than any other writer I have studied.” Sir Thomas Beecham once remarked, “if an opera cannot be played by an organ-grinder, it is not going to achieve immortality.” Richard Rodgers’s songs have been played by organ-grinders, sung by Ella Fitzgerald, and performed by a thousand dance bands. They have more than met the test and have achieved their own form of immortality.<br />From a 1987 piece on George Abbott, an insight into the director’s ear for talent, elicited from the deadpan comic actress Nancy Walker: “I was 19 when I went to tryouts for ‘Best Foot Forward.’ The last thing in the world I wanted to be was funny; no girl 19 wants to be funny. But Mr. Abbott listened to me sing and later cast me. In his response to my singing those 32 bars he told me who I was. Beginning right there he defined my career and, in fact, my whole life. And I am eternally grateful. . . . Mr. Abbott’s genius is that he never let me know I was funny.”<br />A memory of seeing the 1949 London production of Christopher Fry’s verse play “The Lady’s Not for Burning,” starring John Gielgud: It just so happened that in the Fry play two young actors were making their stage debuts: Richard Burton and Claire Bloom. Some 40 years later, when I was interviewing Claire for a television series, I told her I had seen that production. “Every night we were in that show,” she said, “there was one scene where I could not resist looking at the audience. It was a scene in which John, in that sonorous, unmistakable voice, would be declaiming blank verse . . . but the audience would be staring, not at Gielgud but at Richard silently scrubbing the floor.”</td>

      <td>President Donald Trump didn’t start the dishwasher rebellion. But after hearing the legitimate complaints of consumers, he has led this nonviolent movement to an entirely peaceful series of victories for common sense.<br />Two years ago this column noted that a band of stout-hearted liberty advocates at the Competitive Enterprise Institute was petitioning the government for a redress of dishwashing grievances. Federal regulations  on appliances were making household chores more difficult, time-consuming and expensive. Team Trump took up the cause and began to seek public comment on how to improve the rules. Numerous consumers shared their views, including someone named Gregory, who wrote to the Department of Energy:<br />The Trump administration has now reformed not just dishwasher rules, but other bureaucratic annoyances as well. This week the Department of Energy reports it has completed two additional final rules:<br />“This is good news for those who like a more powerful shower, as well as those who like a less powerful government,” summarizes Ben Lieberman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.<br />Amen.</td>

      <td>Chadwick Boseman is brilliant in his final role and Viola Davis stars as the titular singer in this adaptation of the August Wilson play.</td>
      <td>Most of “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” a powerful, ultimately shattering screen version of the 1982 August Wilson play, takes place on a single afternoon in 1927, in a seedy Chicago studio where the great blues singer of the title has come to make a record. The Netflix film doesn’t pretend to the broad physical scope of a commercial movie and doesn’t need to. Wilson’s words dictate the production’s form, eloquent words and electrifying soliloquies that resonate in close quarters. Still, the opening sequence plays a thoroughly cinematic trick, and a sly one—young Black men running through the woods at night, barking dogs and a burning torch, except that it’s not what you think. And the final performance of Chadwick Boseman, who died while the film was in post-production, isn’t what you might have hoped for under the circumstances—it’s even better.<br />Mr. Boseman is Levee, the cornetist in a quartet that accompanies Viola Davis’s Ma Rainey, who, in her real-life heyday in the 1920s, was known as the “Mother of the Blues.” (The other musicians are played by Glynn Turman, Colman Domingo and Michael Potts.) Both Levee and Ma are on short fuses, though his is shorter. He’s a hothead with big dreams and what may or may not be an outsize talent; Ma resents his attempts to upstage her with brash riffs. Rages possess him for little or no apparent reason, while her anger smolders until it becomes cold fury. Why these two are so angry is the subject of the piece—George C. Wolfe directed, subtly and astutely, from Ruben Santiago-Hudson’s screen adaptation—and what we come to understand about them is the reason a film based on a 38-year-old play is of the immediate moment.<br />Out of all the notable performances in Mr. Boseman’s foreshortened but remarkable career—as Jackie Robinson in “42,” Thurgood Marshall in “Marshall,” the fallen squad leader Stormin’ Norman in “Da 5 Bloods,” the Wakandan king T’Challa in “Black Panther”—only his furiously dynamic portrayal of the “Godfather of Soul,” James Brown, in “Get on Up” could have predicted the quicksilver nature of his presence here.<br />Mr. Boseman makes his horn player passionate, brash, a compulsive charmer. Levee talks rat-a-tat fast, dispenses insults as sharp as the knife in his pocket. He dreams of having his own band, playing his own songs, but he knows it probably won’t happen. He’s a seducer—of Ma’s young girlfriend, Dussie Mae (Taylour Paige), and of white people in positions of power; for them he will shuck and jive if the self-abasement serves his purpose. Only when he tells a story of a horror that befell him at age 8 does the man make heart-stopping sense. Then we understand his steady-state rage, which has had nowhere to go until he finds the worst possible place for it. Everyone in the band has stories to tell—not as spellbinding or shocking as Levee’s, but full of hurt and pain all the same, which is why “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” speaks so eloquently to our time, when the nation continues to grapple with racial unrest.<br />Ma, a formidable force musically and an implacable one personally, takes no guff from anyone, especially her craven manager, Irvin (Jeremy Shamos), and the devious studio owner, Sturdyvant (Jonny Coyne); both men are white and played coarsely, which is unfortunate; nuanced performances would have nailed their flaws too. Ms. Davis is almost unrecognizable in the role, what with add-on avoirdupois, exuberant makeup, flamboyant costumes (by Ann Roth), gold teeth and eyelashes the size of theater marquees. It’s a startling performance, and her best moment comes not in song but with another August Wilson soliloquy that begins with Ma saying, “White folk don’t understand about the blues.” Ms. Davis’s variations on that theme are about as good as acting gets.</td>

      <td>A Disney+ documentary series finds little tension in its chronicle of the students at New York’s School of American Ballet.</td>
      <td>Of all the pursuits that inspire, and sometimes require, a vocational devotion among children—figure skating, say, or chess—ballet trumps them all. Its standards are exacting, its devotees are obsessive (so are their parents), and the competition is famously ferocious. So it’s a bit of a disappointment to find that “On Pointe,” a six-part series about the prestigious School of American Ballet, doesn’t contain enough tension to fill a toe shoe.<br />There’s certainly enough “reality” programming and phony competition on television, but one does wish there was a little more human anxiety exhibited among the subjects of the series, mostly because its absence feels phony. The beautiful aliens who inhabit the studios and dormitories of the SAB are obviously poised, and not just physically: They are delighted to be there, everybody’s wonderful, the SAB is a dream fulfilled—next stop the New York City Ballet. In the meantime, there’s “The Nutcracker.”<br />Even people who otherwise never attend the ballet attend “The Nutcracker”; for many, the Tchaikovsky classic is the ballet and the “Nutcracker” supreme is the one choreographed by George Balanchine in 1954 and presented every year by the New York City Ballet. One of the virtues of the School of American Ballet is its status as the feeder school to the NYCB; being a young student there means a chance to perform in the annual Christmas season production at Lincoln Center. If anyone thinks those students are blasé about being in “The Nutcracker” at Christmastime, “On Pointe” will set them straight. Although nary an ill word is spoken by anyone in the program, one very young dancer, already a veteran of several “Nutcrackers,” does admit sheepishly that when she was cut from her first production she tore up her “Nutcracker” poster and refused to attend the show. Her fit of pique is amusing—she thinks so too—but not exactly the stuff of high drama. (Only three of the six episodes were available for review.)<br />It’s a handsome production and a bright and inviting Manhattan that our ballet dancers inhabit, some coming from great distances north, south, west and even east (via the 7 train from Queens). Some are day students, while dozens of advanced and intermediate pupils live at the SAB. The excitement of teenage performers at not only being admitted to the country’s most prestigious dance school, but being on their own in New York is palpable as they hug their new dormmates and scamper joyfully about the labyrinth of Lincoln Center. One new SAB dancer explains that when she was admitted to the school, her parents sold their home in California and moved with her to New York, “which was so amazing and I’m so grateful.” If she’s at all disappointed, she hides it well.<br />The students keep to their rigorous schedule, which includes attendance at regular school classes as well as rehearsals. The demands of their teachers are many, and the technique of the school’s founder (Balanchine) is something to which many new students must adjust. The school is adjusting, too: Early in the series longtime SAB faculty members and former dancers Kay Mazzo and Katrina Killian travel to Chinatown to audition and screen applicants, citing diversity as one of their objectives. The gods of dance are intolerant; biology is a would-be dancer’s destiny: The women can tell in the flexibility of any 4-year-old or the “beautiful feet” of any 7-year-old whether the child in question has the potential to be a ballerina. When a group of new students at SAB are being lined up by height, the differences are so minor they’re hard to discern, even by their teacher.</td>

      <td>Several stage versions of Dickens’s holiday fable are now streaming, including Jefferson Mays’s dazzling one-man rendition; also available is a magical pantomime production of Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale.</td>
      <td>Stage versions of “A Christmas Carol” are the “Nutcrackers” of a growing number of American theaters, sure-fire annual cash cows that are both good shows and safe ones—not only because Charles Dickens’s parable of the power of grace is universally known and beloved in the English-speaking world, but also because it evokes the Christmas spirit while steering clear of outright religiosity (no one, not even the reformed Scrooge, is ever shown going to church). It is, in short, a perfect Christmas story for secular audiences, as well as a rattling good tale that lends itself to theatricalization of all kinds.<br />Many of the best “Christmas Carols” I’ve seen this season are one-man shows, of which the most spectacular by far is Jefferson Mays’s version. One of America’s leading stage actors, Mr. Mays is renowned for playing multiple characters in the same show (he portrayed some 40-odd men, women and nonbinary types in Doug Wright’s “I Am My Own Wife”). His fully staged solo version of “A Christmas Carol,” which first ran at Los Angeles’s Geffen Playhouse in 2018 and was headed for Broadway when the pandemic shut it down, is a tour de force of a similar kind, one in which Mr. Mays performs, so far as I could tell, the complete text of Dickens’s novella, turning himself into one character after another with supreme ingenuity.<br />Directed by Michael Arden and designed with spectacular, surprise-laden resourcefulness by Dane Laffrey (set and costumes), Ben Stanton (lights), Lucy Mackinnon (projections) and Joshua D. Reid (sound), this “Christmas Carol” was taped in an empty New York theater by a socially distanced crew and is being streamed as a fundraiser for 78 community and regional drama companies whose revenue sources have been choked off by Covid-19. While performance and production alike are conceived on a grand scale—I long to see it on Broadway next year—you will have no trouble whatsoever enjoying Mr. Mays’s “Christmas Carol” at home, though I recommend you watch it on the biggest video screen available. It is as good as any film version I’ve seen, including the classic 1951 adaptation in which Scrooge is played by Alastair Sim.<br />If you favor a less elaborate, more intimate staging, then I strongly recommend Writers Theatre’s version, in which Michael Halberstam, the company’s artistic director, gives a dramatic small-stage solo reading of “A Christmas Carol” (he carries the book throughout) directed to exceptionally fine effect by Stanton Long. It’s not in any way static—this is a real show, not a lectern reading—and I had no idea that Mr. Halberstam was such an excellent actor (most directors aren’t). I wouldn’t want to have to choose between Mr. Halberstam and Mr. Mays, and their performances are so completely different in style and approach that I was more than happy to watch them on consecutive days.<br />Most of the “Christmas Carols” I’ve seen in past years, however, have been not one-man shows but pageant-like productions with fairly good-sized casts. Needless to say, Covid has made such versions impossible in 2020, but Houston’s Alley Theatre has mounted a Zoom-based version adapted by Doris Baizley and very well directed by Brandon Weinbrenner in which 10 members of the Alley’s resident acting company, all performing from their individual living rooms, divvy up the parts, with David Rainey giving a splendidly pungent, even salty performance as Scrooge. The use of Zoom in this “staging” is more than a mere stopgap: It makes for a winningly homey, family-friendly air.</td>

      <td>On PBS, a concert from the American Pops Orchestra featuring an array of talented singers pays tribute to Ella Fitzgerald’s 1960 Christmas album.</td>
      <td>People in the retail and food-service industries have had a perennial complaint: Beginning around Thanksgiving, the boss puts on the Christmas music, which plays on a loop till New Year’s Eve. It’s always the same music. Day shift to night shift. It makes them crazy. It was probably the same back in 1960, when the great Ella Fitzgerald recorded “Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas,” a roasting of old chestnuts in newly musical ways. It has helped, in its fashion, to maintain sanity ever since.<br />“Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas With Vanessa Williams,” hosted by the multifaceted actress and singer, commemorates the 60th anniversary of that record and certainly reminds us of where we are right now: The musicians of the American Pops Orchestra, directed by Luke Frazier, are all masked; the crowd is sparse, distanced and seated outside at the Meridian International Center in Washington. Much of the performance seems to have been overdubbed, which was probably unavoidable given the outdoor venue; the sound is much bigger than the orchestra. But the music is the point, as is the Fitzgerald spirit (the Ella Fitzgerald Foundation was on board with the show). Visually, “Ella” might be better enjoyed while decorating, wrapping, trimming or shopping online.<br />What should grab a viewer’s total attention is the show’s devotion, however brief, to Fitzgerald herself. One of the monuments of 20th-century pop and jazz, she is a figure with a poignant story, a troubled background that included a stint in a reformatory. (In 1933, she was sentenced to the New York State Training School for Girls in Hudson, N.Y., because she was “ungovernable and will not obey the just and lawful commands of her mother.”) A would-be dancer, she entered an amateur night at the Apollo Theater, lost her nerve and sang instead. The rest is musical history, which began with Chick Webb’s swing-era band and eventually included 13 Grammy Awards and tens of millions of records sold. There’s a photo montage that shows Fitzgerald with her colleagues and admirers, who included Frank Sinatra, Count Basie, Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie; it goes unmentioned, but a very young Ray Brown, the bassist who would become Fitzgerald’s second husband, shows up in a couple of shots as well.<br />Mr. Frazier founded the American Pops Orchestra, he tells us, to celebrate the Great American Songbook, which Fitzgerald helped in no small part to immortalize. The arrangements are from the 1960 originals by Frank DeVol and Russ Garcia, but the performers manage to pay tribute to Fitzgerald’s style while also being themselves. The veteran jazz singer Dee Dee Bridgewater, who is actually in New Orleans (there’s no disguising her absence from the bandstand), has the sensibility closest to Fitzgerald’s, the impulse to use a song’s melody as a launch point for musical exploration. She performs “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” swing-style as well as the notoriously difficult “Sleigh Ride,” which she slays. Norm Lewis sings “The Christmas Song” not like its best-known interpreters, Nat King Cole or Mel Tormé, but more like Johnny Hartman, which takes the oft-heard song in a different direction. Morgan James does a slinky, Ella-fied “Winter Wonderland”—if not right there at the Meridian Center, at least somewhere. And Nova Payton, who kicks things off, delivers “Jingle Bells” with those extra verses that few even realize exist. And which she makes a Christmas gift.</td>

      <td>A darkly comic take on revenge stories falls flat, but Carey Mulligan makes the best of her part.</td>
      <td>Were it not for the presence of Carey Mulligan in the starring role, I’d give “Promising Young Woman” the shortest of shrifts as a festival of terrible acting (apart from her performance) and a stylized but airless polemic on a serious subject—the victimization of women by men who get away with it for a variety of reasons, starting with their being men.<br />Ms. Mulligan, one of the most gifted actors of our time, does what she can—a lot, every now and then—to breathe life into this debut feature by Emerald Fennell. Ditto for the production designer, Michael Perry, and the cinematographer, Benjamin Kracun; candy-colored images combine with ominous shadows to give the production a distinctive look. Beneath its surface, though, the film is far from the shocker it aspires to be. The narrative is telegraphic rather than dramatic, with story points ticked off like bullet points, and the actors (excluding Ms. Mulligan, once again) act mainly for the camera, as if they aren’t sure their leaden emphasis is weighty enough. The intended tone is darkly comic, but the supporting cast isn’t sufficiently skillful to sustain it.<br />The heroine, Ms. Mulligan’s Cassie, lives with her parents at age 30 and has no friends. Her life has been on hold ever since she failed to protect her most cherished friend, a young woman named Nina, from a terrible fate at the hands of drunken louts at a party. Now Cassie, a promising medical-school student until she dropped out, spends her days working behind the counter of a coffee shop and her nights at clubs and bars, where she sets traps for men by pretending to be drunk and helpless.<br />This premise takes her on a journey of increasingly devious ruses and escalating vengeance, while introducing us to a remarkably repellent assortment of lechers, plus a young pediatric surgeon, played clumsily by Bo Burnham, who may not be as creepy as all the others. The ending comes as a surprise, but the most surprising thing about “Promising Young Woman” is how well its star protects herself by finding a core of truth in her concocted character and expressing it through minimalist fury. When Cassie turns her pitiless gaze on offending males, it’s as if she’s back in med school, dissecting cadavers with a scalpel that cuts to the bone.<br />Write to  Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

      <td>Remember when a box of oranges was the most thrilling gift? It still is. Use our guide to varieties and sources to find the best heirloom fruit—the kind you can’t find at the supermarket—picked at its prime.</td>
      <td>IT WAS A RAW, gray morning 10 years ago when a package landed with a thud on my front step. Using a set of keys near the door, I sliced open the box and found dozens of tiny mandarin oranges. A note from a friend promised they would brighten my day.<br />She was right. The oranges, a variety called Kishus from Churchill Orchard in Ojai, Calif., were sunshine in a box: fragrant, sweet, seedless and ridiculously easy to peel. Since that citrus epiphany a decade ago, I’ve often ordered my own winter box of Kishus—in years when I’m sufficiently organized, anyway. Depending on the harvest, Churchill’s can sell out in a matter of days.<br />Until I joined the cult of Kishus, I hadn’t thought about mail-ordering citrus for years. When I was a child in the 1980s, my family used to lug home heavy netted bags of oranges and grapefruits after visiting my grandparents in Florida. Or, if we were lucky, someone would send us a box of Indian River fruit, each orb nestled in crinkly green tissue. Over time, though, the boxes stopped coming and I can’t say I noticed.<br />But the wonder of Kishus made me wonder what else was out there. I’d learned my heirloom apple and tomato varieties, grown for flavor rather than their ability to travel well or sit on a shelf, but I couldn’t tell you what made a navel orange a navel or why these days all grapefruits seem to be pink. Who was growing the best citrus? What varieties should I seek out? Was it worth it, given the carbon footprint, to ship heavy fruit around the country?<br />Piecing the puzzle together required a brief primer on the state of the citrus industry, so I turned to David Karp, a fruit scientist at work on a database of modern citrus varieties. Historically, Florida grew citrus both for juice and to eat out of hand, he explained. Since 2000, diseases such as citrus greening, a bacterial scourge that results in fewer and smaller fruit over time, have clobbered the state’s production. California now dominates the fresh citrus market, though fruit is still grown in Florida, Texas and Arizona.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. government is expanding the number of businesses that can grow marijuana for federally approved study after years of delay under the Trump administration.<br />A Drug Enforcement Administration rule made public Thursday means researchers will be able to study marijuana from more than just one federally sanctioned grower, a farm at the University of Mississippi, which the government has for decades considered the only legal source of marijuana for federal research.<br />“This action enables us to finally produce federally legal cannabis for scientists and doctors,” said George Hodgin, a former Navy SEAL who started his own business in Monterey, Calif., to conduct such research, calling the move “the most meaningful cannabis policy reform at the federal level in six decades.”<br />The DEA under President Obama began seeking applications for additional marijuana growers in August 2016, saying it wanted to expand research into the potential medical uses of marijuana as American society took a more tolerant view of its use. The agency at the time said it was complying with federal law in its push to expand the study of pot, which remains federally prohibited even as more states legalize it.<br />Forty-one applicants, including Mr. Hodgin, other entrepreneurs and a university professor, have submitted requests to grow marijuana for research since then, but their applications went unanswered under the Trump administration.</td>

      <td>Coinbase Global Inc., the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, said it has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, the first major bitcoin-focused company to test the public markets.<br />The company disclosed the news in a blog post Thursday afternoon.<br />The filing positions San Francisco-based Coinbase to be one of the first big IPOs of 2021, in what is expected to be another big year for companies going public.<br />There are a smattering of small crypto-based companies that trade publicly in the U.S. and overseas, but none the size of Coinbase, which was most recently valued at around $8 billion. It is the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume and one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world.<br />Coinbase’s IPO filing comes just a day after bitcoin topped $20,000 for the first time in its 12-year history. The digital currency’s value has nearly tripled in 2020.</td>

      <td>Companies borrow heavily to send cash to owners, boosting debt levels</td>
      <td>When the economy struggles, businesses typically hunker down and preserve cash by cutting spending and dividends. During the Covid-19 slowdown, companies controlled by private-equity firms have often gone the other way, borrowing heavily to pay big dividends to their owners.<br />The payouts boost returns for private-equity firms but can load their companies’ balance sheets with heavy debt at a precarious moment. The maneuvers can leave companies in weaker financial shape, while helping private-equity firms lock in gains, often a few years after their initial investments.<br />The amount of issued debt tied to such payouts, including both loans and bonds, grew to more than $29 billion this year, up more than 25% from 2019, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence’s LCD. Of that, loan volumes have grown well over 40% while bonds have fallen.<br />The payouts, known as dividend recapitalizations, are striking considering the pandemic’s economic disruption. By comparison, during the last recession, in 2008-09, such activity nearly dried up, the data shows.<br />One reason dividends fell so much in the last downturn is lenders grew cautious and wouldn’t lend to companies already considered to be risky. This time, near-zero interest rates and robust government buying of corporate bonds have pushed investors to take more risk to get a decent return.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A bipartisan agreement to prevent patients from receiving surprise medical bills was expected to be included in a year-end legislative package being completed in Congress, according to aides, after more than two years of negotiation.<br />A group of four House and Senate committees last week released a bipartisan agreement to install new patient protections and establish a new system for resolving billing disputes. Lawmakers this week pushed colleagues to support adding it to the broader year-end spending and Covid 19-aid legislation.<br />Surprise billing typically occurs when a patient is treated at a hospital in his or her insurance network by a medical professional who isn’t, potentially leading to crippling medical charges.<br />“It’s the broadest solution we’ll ever have on that important issue,” Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), the retiring chairman of the Senate Health Committee, told reporters Thursday. Mr. Alexander indicated that whether to include the agreement was now up to the four congressional leaders. “It’s been very thoroughly vetted in many hearings in many committees, so it’s time to end the discussion,” he said.<br />Sens. Bill Cassidy (R., La.) and Maggie Hassan (D., N.H.), both members of the health committee, sent a letter Tuesday signed by 25 other senators to Senate leaders, urging them to include the agreement in the year-end package. Congressional leaders hope to bundle together a full-year spending bill, an emerging coronavirus relief package, and other issues where there is bipartisan consensus.</td>

Coke will make the job cuts through a combination of buyouts and layoffs, a spokesman said. In August, it offered voluntary-separation packages to about 4,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada. The company didn’t say how many people participated.<br />Coke’s North America business unit will be reorganized to look more like other units around the world. Until now in North America, the company’s fountain-machine business, bottle-and-can business and Minute Maid operations each had their own teams for marketing, communicating with retailers and coordinating with bottlers. Those teams will be consolidated, the company said.<br />Coke expects the job cuts to result in annual savings of between $350 million and $550 million, the spokesman said. The latest cuts include about 500 jobs in the Atlanta metro area, where the company is based.</td>

A spokesman for Mrs. von der Leyen later noted that the rollout date was conditional on approval from the EU’s top drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency.<br />Earlier this week, the EMA said it would advance its review of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after coming under pressure from some governments, setting a new date of Dec. 21 to decide on whether to authorize it. On Thursday, the EMA said that it would also accelerate its review of a  Moderna Inc.  vaccine, and would decide whether to authorize that shot on Jan. 6, instead of Jan. 12, as previously scheduled.<br />“We have been able to revise the timetables for the evaluation of the Covid-19 vaccines due to the incredible efforts of everybody involved in these assessments,” said EMA Executive Director Emer Cooke. “The number of infections is increasing across Europe and we are aware of the huge responsibility we have to get a vaccine to the market as quickly as is feasible.”</td>

      <td>Target vaccines to the most vulnerable, and don’t give them to people who have already been infected.</td>
      <td>The approval of several Covid-19 vaccines is an impressive technological development that should rapidly end the lockdowns and allow normal life to resume. But authorities like Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates argue that lockdown restrictions may have to continue through the fall and even into 2022, notwithstanding the catastrophic harms the lockdowns have caused, especially to young people, the poor and the working classes.<br />The imminent dissemination of vaccines can help end lockdowns by the end of January. The Great Barrington Declaration, which we wrote with Martin Kulldorff of Harvard Medical School, provides the key idea: focused protection of people who face a high risk of mortality should they become infected.<br />The risk of mortality from Covid-19 infection is now well established by seroprevalence studies conducted world-wide. Seroprevalence studies measure a lower bound on the number of people who have been infected. There is a sharp age gradient in the survival rate after infection. At least 99.95% of people under 70 survive infection; that figure is only 95% for 70 and older.<br />Covid-19 is thus especially deadly for the old and others with chronic conditions. But the lockdowns are deadly as well. The harms include plummeting childhood vaccination, worse cardiovascular disease outcomes, and less cancer screening, to name a few. It’s impossible to quantify the total deaths they have caused and will cause, but it’s safe to conclude that for people under 70 without chronic conditions—especially children and young adults—Covid-19 is far less deadly than a lockdown. For children, the cessation of in-person schooling has led to severe learning losses, which are predicted to shorten the lifespans of affected students. Among 25- to 44-year-olds, the CDC reports a 26% increase in excess all-cause mortality relative to past years, though less than 5% of 2020 deaths have been due to Covid-19.<br />Given these facts, the Great Barrington Declaration calls for focused protection for the vulnerable. That means directing limited resources, now including vaccines, to shield these people from infection. For the rest of the population, it calls for an end to lockdown. Tens of thousands of epidemiologists, public health scholars, and physicians have signed on to this plan. But it has been dismissed by others who argue that perfect protection of the vulnerable is impossible.</td>

      <td>London<br />Not that anyone can tell from this month’s excitement about negotiations for a Brexit trade deal, but Britain’s departure from the European Union is already done. It’s done in the technical sense that the U.K. left the bloc on Jan. 31. More important, it’s done as a political issue—and British politicians increasingly seem to realize it.<br />It’s sometimes hard to see this evolution when Europe is preoccupied with the spectacle of yet another round of trade talks going down to the wire. The transitional trade agreement effected on Britain’s Jan. 31 departure will expire Dec. 31, and Brussels and London haven’t agreed on what will come after it. The high but confusing drama of the moment concerns whether the parties can devise a long-term trade deal that eliminates tariffs and loosens regulatory red tape at the borders.<br />Such an agreement is important from an economic standpoint. It would limit trade disruption to both sides at a time when they need to focus on recovery from the pandemic. That said, and without minimizing the potential for severe short-term pain if the talks fail, much of the drama surrounding these negotiations has a manufactured feel.<br />The alternative to a comprehensive deal is to revert to the more common sort of trade arrangements one normally expects between two sovereign economies, with tariffs and regulations governed by World Trade Organization rules. Since “two sovereign economies” is what the U.K. and EU have been since Jan. 31, this possibility was easy to foresee.</td>

After he was evacuated to Berlin, European doctors said traces of a Soviet-era nerve agent, called Novichok, were found in his system, adding another flashpoint in already toxic relations between Russia and the West.</td>

      <td>Search giant faces two—likely soon to be three—antitrust lawsuits</td>
      <td>A pair of sweeping antitrust lawsuits against Google this fall essentially grapple with one central question: Is Google good?<br />For most of its 22-year history, the search giant has enjoyed an enviable public reputation as an omnipresent yet benevolent force. As its parent,  Alphabet Inc.,  morphed into a trillion-dollar conglomerate—more than five times as large as a decade ago—top executives stuck to their line that Google’s market dominance is simply because consumers choose to use its products. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said this year, “I’m really focused on giving users what they want.”<br />The antitrust lawsuits—from federal prosecutors and a separate coalition of 10 states—allege nefarious activities. They say Google, through secretive, interlocking agreements with other technology giants including  Apple Inc.  and  Facebook Inc.,  muscles out competitors and sells out the very users it claims to protect. “The halcyon days of Google’s youth are a distant memory,” says the state lawsuit, led by Texas. “Its modus operandi is to monopolize and misrepresent.”<br />Here is a look at the dueling narratives.<br />Federal and state prosecutors undertook separate, overlapping investigations over the course of roughly a year and a half. The federal suit, filed in October, focused on Google’s flagship search business, which accounts for the vast majority of U.S. queries. The government said the status quo effectively left no room for competition.</td>

Do you recall your first taste of a truly great wine—one that left you thinking, So this is what I’ve been missing? That’s what it’s like to discover meaty Cantabrian anchovies or buttery ventresca (albacore belly) in olive oil after a life of dollar sardines and waterlogged tuna.<br />In the last few years, conservas have been popping up on restaurant menus across the U.S., from Saltie Girl in Boston to Cata Vino in Detroit to Verjus in San Francisco. Alex Raij, co-owner of Txikito, La Vara and Saint Julivert in New York City, was one of the first stateside chefs to give conservas their due. “I’ve always been fascinated by them because they can amplify flavors, as with anchovies, and even change textures, as with mussels, turning them from firm to soft,” she said.<br />At home, a cupboard stocked with shelf-stable fish is never a bad idea, especially when we’re making fewer trips to the grocery store. A can of cockles takes the grunt work out of spaghetti alle vongole, clam chowder and seafood risotto—no purging, steaming or shelling.<br />On nights when cooking at all sounds as enticing as a nasopharyngeal swab, there are meal-in-one tins that have you covered. Just crack open La Brújula’s mussels in escabeche or Donostia’s salt cod stew, both gratifying alongside a fruity Spanish red and a bit of baguette for sopping.</td>

The inflated federal unemployment benefit program included in the Cares Act led to more than two-thirds of workers earning more from unemployment than they were earning in their previous job, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.<br />When the Cares Act passed, I was concerned about the effect these payments would have on employment numbers. The data reported in Messrs. Mulligan and Moore’s article shows that the federal unemployment benefit provided incentives for unemployed Americans to stay home and out of the workforce. And when the benefit expired in August, the unemployed returned to work in large numbers.<br />To prevent this policy failure from repeating itself, my colleague Rep. Ted Budd and I introduced the Getting Americans Back to Work Act. This legislation would cap unemployment benefits at 100% of previous wages, supporting Americans through this unprecedented time while also avoiding distortions in our labor market brought about by overzealous government action. Without this guardrail, policy makers risk cementing the economic turmoil caused by Covid-19. We must support Americans and safely get people back to work.<br />Rep.

      <td>No matter what food companies serve up these days, investors seem to be left unsatisfied.<br />General Mills  reported excellent results Thursday. Net sales during the quarter ended Nov. 29 rose 7% from a year earlier. This was led by 18% sales growth for both its pet-food segment and North America meals and baking, which includes brands such as Progresso soup and Pillsbury biscuits. Earnings per share rose 17% to $1.11, well past analyst expectations for 97 cents, according to FactSet.<br />Yet shares were only slightly higher in Thursday morning trading. Last week,  Campbell Soup ’s  stock fell after it reported similarly strong figures. Investors are refusing to believe that the good times can last once Americans start commuting to work again, restaurants fully reopen, and more meals are again consumed outside the home.<br />For months, food companies have presented a well-reasoned case why at least some of the sales boost will persist. Families that have invested in new kitchen equipment and learned new cooking skills are likely to keep on cooking, they argue. Yet investors remain unconvinced. General Mills is up around 10% so far this year, compared with a 15% rise in the S&P 500. Campbell is down by about 5%.<br />On Thursday’s conference call, General Mills Chief Executive Jeff Harmening bolstered the argument, pointing to real-world evidence from two countries where the worst of the pandemic has already passed: China and Australia. General Mills owns a Chinese frozen dumpling brand, Wanchai Ferry, which is still seeing double-digit sales growth five or six months after lockdowns in the country have ended, he said.</td>

Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), the chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig on Thursday requesting the briefing about the suspected Russian cyber-espionage operation.<br />“Given the extreme sensitivity of personal taxpayer information entrusted to the IRS, and the harm both to Americans’ privacy and our national security that could result from the theft and exploitation of this data by our adversaries, it is imperative that we understand the extent to which the IRS may have been compromised,” the senators wrote.<br />The lawmakers asked for details about how the IRS was mitigating potential damage, ensuring the hackers didn’t “still have access to internal IRS systems,” and what it was doing to prevent future hacks of taxpayer data.<br />The U.S. Treasury Department, where the IRS is housed, was breached in the hack, according to people familiar with an investigation into the hack, along with many other agencies, including the Commerce Department, State Department and Department of Homeland Security. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the intelligence community are all investigating the intrusion, as are private sector firms.</td>

      <td>European Union antitrust officials give the green light to the acquisition after Google promised concessions</td>
      <td>European Union antitrust officials approved Google’s $2.1 billion acquisition of health tracker  Fitbit Inc.,  but will enforce conditions on the deal aimed at protecting users’ health data and preserving competition in the wearable-tech sector.<br />The European Commission, the EU’s top antitrust regulator, said Thursday that it has accepted a sweetened package of concessions from Google, clearing the way for the  Alphabet Inc.  company to push more deeply into the wearable-device and health-data businesses.<br />Google offered its concessions as part of the EU’s in-depth investigation into the deal, which the bloc opened in August after rejecting Google’s initial commitments as inadequate. The Fitbit deal, first agreed to in November 2019, remains under review by the U.S. Justice Department and Australia’s competition authority.<br />To address competition concerns, Google is now promising not to use Fitbit data for advertising purposes in Europe, and to store such data separate from any other Google data used in ads. The company also promised to allow users to link competing apps to their Fitbit data, and committed to allowing competing wearable-device makers open access to functions of Google’s Android operating system.<br />The commitments will remain in force for 10 years, and the advertising-related commitments can be extended for another 10 years. An independent trustee with access to internal Google documents will enforce the promises, the commission said.</td>

      <td>Jihadist group Boko Haram released a video purporting to show dozens of the schoolboys it kidnapped from a high school in northwest Nigeria six days ago, in which hostages say that some of their classmates have died and beg for the government to negotiate their release.<br />The grainy six-minute video, published by Nigerian news website HumAngle, shows a large group of young boys crouching under thick thorn branches, flanked by masked gunmen.<br />“Please, sir, you have to send all the soldiers and armies and the jets back,” says one boy, visibly terrified, apparently referring to the Nigerian military’s rescue effort. “You have to close any kind of schools excluding Islamiyah,” he says, referring to Islamic schools. “Please, sir,” the boy says again, his voice cracking with emotion, before a chorus of children’s voices echo his plea.<br />The video couldn’t be independently verified but two specialists on Boko Haram said it carried the group’s black-and-white-flag branding alongside a short audio clip from leader Abubakar Shekau to verify its authenticity.<br />The group, which has been at war with the Nigerian state since 2009, first claimed on Tuesday it had seized students from the Kankara Government Science Secondary School, an all-boys boarding school in Katsina, northwest Nigeria, to punish them for “un-Islamic practices.” Shekau—the most wanted man in Africa, with a $7 million U.S. bounty on his head—has repeatedly warned Nigeria’s government to close all secular schools, which Boko Haram says spread ungodly ideas. Analysts said the video appeared to have been published, in part, to rebut skepticism that Shekau’s fighters could mount a huge kidnapping operation in Nigeria’s northwest, hundreds of miles from their strongholds in the northeast.</td>

      <td>As corporate executives in the late 1970s grew baffled by a proliferation of computer and other information-technology choices, Gideon Gartner saw an opportunity: Why not offer them advice on what to buy, when to buy it and how much to pay?<br />Mr. Gartner, a former International Business Machines Corp. executive and star Wall Street analyst, in 1979 formed Gartner Group, now known as  Gartner Inc . , to sell that advice in the form of punchy two-page notes, client consultations and eventually mammoth conferences. He hired aggressive sales people and analysts, paid them well and created a durable business, now part of the S&P 500, with revenue of $4.2 billion last year and a current stock market value of about $14 billion.<br />Mr. Gartner died Dec. 12 of complications from Alzheimer’s disease at his home in New York. He was 85.<br />Former colleagues said Mr. Gartner was better as a visionary than as a chief executive. He had so many ideas—and was so insistent that colleagues should rush them into the market—that he sometimes became a distraction. The Stamford, Conn.-based company’s board pushed him out in early 1993. To compete against his old company, he founded Giga Information Group Inc. That company, innovative but much less successful, was sold in 2003 to  Forrester Research Inc.  for about $60 million.<br />Mr. Gartner, who sometimes played his teal Bösendorfer piano in the small hours when he couldn’t sleep, wanted to be able to reach people instantly when inspired by a new idea. He once telephoned an employee at home only to learn that he was in the bathroom and unavailable. Mr. Gartner made a point of giving cordless phones to colleagues at a 1983 holiday party.</td>

The weekly figures can be volatile around the holidays due to seasonal-adjustment issues.<br />“The next few months will be pretty rough for the labor market as you do see businesses having to contend with this latest wave of Covid cases,” Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities, said. “You are seeing those government restrictions coming into play again.”<br />Ms. House, and many other economists, project the labor market will cool until vaccines are widely distributed.

      <td>The NBA title usually goes to a team with the best players, the finest strategy and the most luck. But this year, with the league rushing toward the start of a new season during a bleak stretch of the Covid-19 pandemic, that might not be enough. There is another crucial metric that could determine the next champion.<br />“Which team is not going to have positive people,” said Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic.<br />The greatest source of uncertainty before the most uncertain NBA season of all time begins next week is how teams will deal with the extended absences, sudden disruptions and the inevitable volatility that comes with playing basketball in a pandemic. There has never been a better time to have a deep roster—because what happens off the court will dictate who’s on the court.<br />Unlike the last time they played, when the NBA sequestered itself in a bubble, teams will be traveling across the country and risking coronavirus infections to play a 72-game compressed season. The timing could not be worse. Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. are nearing or breaking record highs and public health officials are predicting that January will be the darkest month of a grim winter before mass vaccinations end the pandemic.<br />Most arenas will be empty. Practice gyms have already closed for deep cleaning. The Toronto Raptors are snowbirding in Tampa, Fla. Players will disappear when they test positive and games might be postponed if entire teams have to enter quarantine.</td>

While inaugural events on the Capitol grounds are paid for by Congress, the Presidential Inaugural Committee typically pays for receptions, concerts and other programming, a spokeswoman for the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies said.</td>

Among services sector firms, it has the second-highest rate, surpassed only by Turkey.<br />The country’s public banks are a not-inconsiderable part of the problem, according to work by Daehee Jeong, an economist at the Korea Development Institute.

Mr. Macron hasn’t shown severe symptoms, according to a person close to the president.<br />Mr. Macron’s test result immediately rippled across Europe, affecting the activities of a number of leaders who have recently been in contact with him.

Bars, restaurants and theaters have remained closed across France, but the government has allowed stores and many other businesses to resume operations for the Christmas shopping season. The government plans to relax the curfew on Christmas Eve, allowing holiday gatherings to take place.<br />On Monday, Mr. Macron hosted a lunch with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, European Council President Charles Michel and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Secretary-General Angel Gurría. That was followed by a Tuesday lunch with the party whips of France’s National Assembly. On Wednesday, he lunched with Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa and presided over a cabinet meeting, in which everyone present wore masks and adhered to social-distancing guidelines, a spokeswoman said.</td>

      <td>Subscribers’ picks beat both the market and our columnists in Heard on the Street’s fourth annual stock-picking contest</td>
      <td>Ignoring scary headlines can boost your bottom line.<br />Heard on the Street’s columnists and 1,764 of our readers had to contend with the thorniest environment of our four annual stock-picking contests so far: a global pandemic, a contentious U.S. presidential election and record-high prices for technology stocks. Despite a deadly second surge of Covid-19 and a political contest that left a bitter aftertaste, stocks hit fresh records. People in much of the world hunkered down but kept up their spending on physical purchases even as investors grew more confident that they would soon spend again on experiences. The best performers of all were companies with shiny, new technologies and lots of skeptics.<br />Heard’s columnists anticipated some of this but were too pessimistic overall. Our picks had an average return of only 5.4%, not including dividends, lagging behind the S&P 500. The top 14 performers were all “buy” recommendations, while the seven worst picks were all “sells.” Readers were more attuned to the markets’ mood, with a total return of 14.5% across their 3,390 picks.<br />The best Heard bet by far, and 296th overall in the contest, was by retail columnist Jinjoo Lee, whose old-school pick,  Qurate Retail ,  managed to shine in a tough year for physical stores, rising 65%. The owner of television shopping bazaar QVC has expanded sales during the pandemic yet sported a bargain-bin valuation compared with department stores and big-box retailers. The second-best Heard pick, Jon Sindreu’s recommendation to buy  Axon Enterprise ,  the maker of Tasers and police body cameras, rose 57% on concern over public unrest and a backlash against police brutality. The next two winning picks were both non-U.S. auto makers,  Fiat Chrysler  and Geely Automotive, recommended by Stephen Wilmot and Jacky Wong, respectively.<br />But 223 readers bet on an auto maker that left those companies in the dust:  Tesla .  The electric-car pioneer already was worth more than several established manufacturers in August and by this month had a market capitalization as high as several of them combined. Its valuation seemed ludicrous enough in August 2019, when selling Tesla was the most popular bet in our contest of that year. That ended badly, yet hope triumphed over experience as some 237 subscriber picks in this year’s contest were shorts on Tesla. Its shares have surged 114% since the first week of August.</td>

      <td>Investors bidding up newly public shares of  DoorDash  and its competitors shouldn’t take for granted the historically fragile relationship between food-delivery platforms and the restaurants they serve.<br />While it is unclear just how sticky eaters’ business will be on delivery apps once the coronavirus pandemic ends, their loyalty could in many cases depend upon whether their favorite restaurants stay around. That is hardly a guarantee.<br />Delivery platforms have been essential to the survival of many restaurants this year, bringing them business even while their dining rooms have remained closed down. In addition to offering grants and relaxed delivery fees in some cases, the platforms have been working to use the pandemic as an opportunity to prove their long-term value to restaurants, many of which had once scorned their services because of high commissions or questionable business practices.<br />There is no question delivery players have won over lots of new restaurants for now. This is evidenced by big increases across platforms in partnered restaurants, or those with which platforms have an agreement to offer their goods to consumers. In the first nine months of the year, for example, regulatory filings show  Grubhub  added approximately 90,000 partnered restaurants, or 37% of the total number it had as of Sept. 30.  Uber Technologies  said in its third-quarter report that Uber Eats grew active partnered restaurants by 70% year over year.<br />DoorDash similarly seems to have added something like 50,000 merchants in the several months before its initial public offering filing alone. And although its early growth may have been in part fueled by facilitating deliveries without prior consent of restaurants, according to D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White, DoorDash now says partner merchants account for nearly all the platform’s gross order value.</td>

      <td>Superlow rates may be slowing the move to a replacement benchmark; more time for some loans to switch could ease the final transition</td>
      <td>The transition period away from the universal but tarnished funding benchmark, the London interbank offered rate, in the U.S. has gotten a bit longer for some loans. That will be mostly welcome news for many investors.<br />The typical investor’s exposure to the risks of a transition to a new benchmark aren’t terribly direct. Credit cards are typically floating-rate, but are often linked to the prime rate, not Libor—although the cost of funding for some card loans may be via securitizations priced in Libor terms. A subset of investors may own preferred shares, like those issued by banks, whose payouts are tied to Libor.<br />But a more common exposure is via mortgages. Over $1 trillion worth of residential mortgages are estimated to have adjustable rates linked to Libor. Funding for mortgage loans historically also is often Libor-based, via warehouse lines from banks, the securitization market or Federal Home Loan Bank advances. In addition to being home borrowers, many investors are now also betting on the mortgage business itself via stocks like rapidly growing and highly valued originator  Rocket  Cos.<br />For mortgages, a delay in the end of Libor might come at just the right time. U.S. regulators in November backed a proposal that while new debt still shouldn’t be linked to Libor beyond 2021, many existing debts can continue to reference it for another 18 months, through June 2023.<br />That means the transition period for many loans may be put off to a time when rates are less extraordinarily low, which could be a good thing. Right now there is relatively little demand for certain floating-rate mortgages or funding, which some analysts say has slowed the market’s evolution toward a new benchmark.</td>

      <td>Chinese EV companies—most of them unprofitable—have seen their valuations soar to levels similar to those of the American auto giants</td>
      <td>China’s electric-vehicle makers have surged in value, boosted by bold national green-energy targets and individual investors hoping for a repeat of  Tesla Inc.’s  stunning performance.<br />American depositary receipts in  NIO Inc.,  the best known Chinese company focused solely on electric vehicles, have jumped roughly 11-fold this year, lifting its market value to nearly $70 billion as of Wednesday, according to FactSet. In Hong Kong, shares of Warren Buffett-backed  BYD Co. , which produces hybrid electric- and gasoline-powered cars, as well as batteries, have more than quadrupled, valuing it at $69 billion.<br />The meteoric rises put these companies in line with large traditional car makers, such as  General Motors Co.  and  Ford Motor Co. , which had market values of $59 billion and $36 billion, respectively, on a fully diluted basis.<br />For now, though, most Chinese upstarts are unprofitable—and they are also selling far fewer vehicles than major automobile groups.  Xpeng Inc.,  for example, delivered more than 14,000 cars in the first three quarters of 2020. By comparison, GM sold more than 1.9 million cars in China during the same period.<br />Tesla’s success has fed investor enthusiasm, as has China’s pledge to become carbon-neutral by 2060, said Elizabeth Kwik, investment manager for Asian equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “China is very serious about achieving this goal,” she said, citing President Xi Jinping’s personal endorsement.</td>

      <td>Australia has been hit hard by sagging demand because immigrants and foreign students have been shut out</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—A year ago, a studio apartment in central Sydney was in such hot demand from foreign students and expat workers that landlords could often find a tenant within days.<br />Adam van Rooijen’s inner-city apartment in Potts Point was recently vacant for six weeks.<br />“No one is really moving anywhere,” said Mr. van Rooijen, 37, who bought the investment property in April, just after Australia shut its border to international arrivals, closed swaths of commerce and restricted people’s movement in response to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Median rents in Potts Point, near Sydney’s harborside, are down 24% since March. Mr. van Rooijen tried engaging a real-estate agent and listing the property on Facebook Inc.’s Marketplace platform, alongside secondhand lawn mowers and coffee tables. He eventually accepted a 17% cut in rent to fill the property.<br />Apartments are turning out to be the big losers in a pandemic-fueled reordering of the global property market. Record-low mortgage rates, work-from-home arrangements and a desire for more space have driven demand for houses at the expense of apartments. According to  Redfin Corp. , an online real-estate platform, the average price discount for condos in the U.S. has widened to a record 17.3% this year.</td>

      <td>Demand from streaming services creates opportunities for the company behind the visual effects of ‘Avatar’ and ‘Avengers’</td>
      <td>At a time when much of Hollywood is reeling from Covid-19, Weta Digital, the visual-effects company behind “Avatar” and “Avengers: Endgame,” is looking to pull a growth story out of its magic hat.<br />The closely held New Zealand-based company, which was co-founded by “Lord of the Rings” director and special-effects wizard Peter Jackson, is adding some heavy hitters to its board of directors, including former  Walt Disney  Co.  Chief Operating Officer Tom Staggs.<br />Weta—named after an insect endemic to New Zealand—is also on the hunt for acquisitions in the special effects and animation space, part of a strategy to pivot into content creation as new streaming platforms look to stock up on fresh programming.<br />“We have a crew of over 1,200 people, very skilled, very talented people doing the best special effects I think that anyone does,” Mr. Jackson said in an interview. “And so we thought, how can we give this crew exciting projects going forward that go beyond just providing some shots for other people’s films.”<br />Mr. Jackson sees a big opportunity to provide animated programming for streaming services as well as movies and cable channels. “There’s a demand that’s tending to outstrip supply right now,” he said. Another plus for animation is that it is Covid-proof. While fears of the spread of coronavirus have made it challenging to shoot on TV and movie sets, animation work can be done remotely.</td>
