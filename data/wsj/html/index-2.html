For any citizens crying out that there has to be a better way, the good news is that a number of states have been moving quickly to get shots into arms. Recently this column noted the speed of vaccinations in West Virginia. Fortunately the Mountain State is not the only success story.<br />“South Dakota among leaders in COVID-19 inoculations,” notes a headline in the Sioux Falls Argus Leader. It seems that state leaders didn’t believe the media consensus that a rapid vaccine approval couldn’t happen. They were prepared for the possibility of success.  The Argus Leader reports:<br />South Dakota seems to rely heavily on private management and decision-making on the ground:<br />Instead of a new government-designed plan for distribution, Gov. Kristi Noem (R., S.D.) has largely relied on existing methods for delivering care. The Argus Leader reports:<br />***</td>

      <td>Australian lenders hope no-interest cards can arrest a decline in usage and attract younger customers</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—Interest charges have been one of the defining features of credit cards for decades and so when an employee at a big Australian bank suggested getting rid of them, he was taking a risk.<br />“He said, ‘Well, what about a no-interest credit card?’ ” said Rachel Slade, personal banking group executive at  National Australia Bank Ltd. , recalling a feedback session at one of the lender’s Melbourne offices. “And everyone’s like, ‘What? That’s not how a credit card works.’ ”<br />Worried about dwindling credit-card usage during the coronavirus pandemic and the rapid rise of startups like Australia’s  Afterpay Ltd.  and Sweden’s Klarna Bank AB that allow consumers to pay for goods in installments, some banks are rethinking what has been one of their most lucrative businesses.<br />National Australia Bank, known locally as NAB, launched a no-interest credit card in September. Users get a fixed line of credit and the bank levies a monthly fee, which is refunded if the customer maintains a zero balance and doesn’t use the card.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia ,  the country’s largest lender by market value, also unveiled a no-interest card last year.<br />The experiment isn’t being replicated in the U.S. where most credit-card issuers charge interest when cardholders carry balances. But if they prove to be successful, Australian banks’ no-interest cards could drive change in other markets.</td>

      <td>Democratic lawmakers press ahead with efforts to remove president following riot at U.S. Capitol</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats said they plan to vote on impeaching President Trump on Wednesday, accusing him of inciting supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol, as Congress careened toward a fresh showdown over Mr. Trump’s behavior in the final days of the administration.<br />House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment on Monday morning and said they would move ahead regardless of tepid Republican support. While some Republicans have condemned the president for encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol as lawmakers were voting to ratify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, only a handful have expressed support for removing him from office through impeachment or other means.<br />Democrats would need a majority vote in the House to impeach the president, and a two-thirds supermajority in the Senate to convict. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has said there would be no time to conduct a trial and vote in the Senate before Inauguration Day, likely leaving the matter to the incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).<br />The Senate can hold a trial for Mr. Trump even after his presidency ends, which some lawmakers see as justified in both condemning Mr. Trump’s actions and potentially banning Mr. Trump from running again.<br />“Whether impeachment can pass the United States Senate is not the issue,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.). “The issue is, we have a president who most of us believe participated in encouraging an insurrection and attack on this building and on democracy.”</td>

      <td>The House could impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection, and a Senate trial could take place after he leaves office—or be delayed indefinitely</td>
      <td>The House of Representatives is preparing to impeach President Trump for a second time, just over a year after it first impeached him for pressing Ukraine to announce investigations that would have aided him politically. Here’s how the unprecedented process could play out.<br />The Constitution gives broad leeway to the House of Representatives to handle the impeachment process. There are no limits on the number of times someone may be impeached, though Mr. Trump would be the first person ever to be impeached more than once.<br />Because President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration is so soon, the practical effects of a second impeachment by the House would mostly be symbolic and dependent upon what the Senate decides to do. The Senate is currently adjourned and cannot reconvene until Jan. 19 unless it has the unanimous consent of all 100 members—something that is extremely unlikely to happen. That means that an impeachment trial, if the House sends over an article, can’t begin until Trump’s last full day in office at the earliest.<br />If the Senate proceeds to a trial and successfully convicts Mr. Trump, he couldn’t be removed from an office he didn’t hold. But the Senate could immediately hold a follow-up vote, subject only to a simple majority, to ban Mr. Trump—who has weighed another presidential run in 2024—from ever seeking office again. Those are the only punishments the Senate can consider as part of an impeachment conviction.<br />Yes. In fact, the precedent for holding articles of impeachment in the House after they are approved is just over a year old. During Mr. Trump’s first impeachment, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) waited several weeks to send over articles to the Senate while she and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fought over trial rules.</td>

The firm wasn’t interested in receiving a lone seat or becoming “an isolated stockholder advocate” on the board, according to the letter. GameStop has said it offered to add him as a director.<br />Now, however, Mr. Cohen and two former executives at Chewy, an online retailer of pet products, have joined the board, GameStop said Monday.<br />GameStop shares rose more than 11% in afternoon trading Monday.<br />The Grapevine, Texas-based company has been trying to adapt a business model centered on physical stores to the increased demand for games available for download. Its revenue has fallen over the past several years even as consumer spending on videogames has shot up. It also has had to contend with executive turnover—its current chief executive is the fifth person in that position since late 2017—and pressure from other shareholders.</td>

Restaurant chains, supermarket operators and food distributors have accused chicken companies of coordinating production and pricing to boost prices for staples like chicken breasts, tenders and wings.<br />Last year the U.S. Department of Justice filed criminal price-fixing and bid-rigging charges against 10 poultry-industry executives, including two former chief executives of Pilgrim’s. The defendants have pleaded not guilty.<br />Colorado-based Pilgrim’s said Monday that the civil settlement remains subject to court approval, and that the company isn’t admitting to the chicken buyers’ claims. Lawsuits filed individually by major supermarket and restaurant chains remain outstanding, the company said.<br />Pilgrim’s and other U.S. chicken suppliers face ongoing lawsuits from some of their top customers, including chicken sandwich giant Chick-fil-A Inc., supermarket operators  Walmart Inc.  and  Kroger Co. , and food-service distributors  Sysco Corp.  and  US Foods Holding Corp.</td>

The conservative social network founded in 2018 exploded in popularity among supporters of President Trump after the November U.S. election.<br />“AWS’s decision to effectively terminate Parler’s account is apparently motivated by political animus. It is also apparently designed to reduce competition in the microblogging services market to the benefit of  Twitter , ” according to the complaint, which also accused Amazon of breaching a contract between the parties.<br />Amazon said Saturday that it would cut off Parler because it wasn’t confident in its ability to sufficiently police content on its platform that incites violence. The company said while it would no longer provide web services to Parler after Sunday at 11:59 p.m. Pacific time, it would preserve the platform’s data and help it migrate to different servers.<br />In its complaint, Parler also accused Amazon of applying a double standard than with other platforms, noting that Twitter had recently signed a multi-year web-hosting deal with the company.</td>

Daniel R. Hokanson, who is in charge of the National Guard Bureau, said in a press briefing Monday that the troop levels could rise to 15,000. He didn’t specify which states the Guard members would come from, whether they would be armed or the details of their mission.<br />The planned deployments represent an increase from the roughly 6,200 troops who arrived from six states in response to a pro-Trump mob’s violent attack on the Capitol Wednesday after the president urged his supporters to march on the legislature while lawmakers were meeting there to certify electoral votes. The bolstered force would be larger than contingents of Guardsmen at past inaugurations. Roughly 9,000 were in Washington for President Obama’s inauguration, Gen. Hokanson said.<br />The decision to deploy more Guard personnel came after military planners and local law enforcement evaluated their planned security posture and discussed how many more troops could be useful.<br />After Wednesday’s deadly assault on the Capitol, Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller formally approved deploying 6,200 Guardsmen from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and Maryland. The first of those arrived Thursday morning and are currently securing the perimeter around the Capitol and conducting other logistical support.</td>

      <td>Joe Biden arguably gets the best of all policy-measurement worlds when he enters the White House.</td>
      <td>Jason Furman recapped “The Policy Lessons of the ‘Trump Economy’” (op-ed, Dec. 30) in a generally nonpartisan manner. Presidents are often at the mercy of uncontrollable events and the business cycle and an assessment of long-term results of a president’s policies based on shorter-term marginal benefits or detriments is dicey, at best. Mr. Furman’s summary of the difficulties in measuring a president’s policy results is welcome, although one doesn’t recall him saying during his time as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers that it was premature to give President’s Obama’s policies too much credit for an extended (but not very robust) recovery.<br />Joe Biden arguably gets the best of all policy-measurement worlds when he enters the White House. If the pandemic’s effects drag on, lockdowns take a new toll and the economy stalls or double dips into recession, Mr. Trump owns the downside. If the economy continues to recover, Mr. Biden clearly owns the 2021 upside, especially if he and the Democrats can advance another large stimulus package. A strong economic recovery based on effective vaccines and pent-up demand will be attributed to Mr. Biden’s policies, regardless of any more relevant measurement of long-term results.<br />A long-term perspective regarding economic polices is appropriate, but how can that happen when most media scorekeepers are partisans and campaigning for 2022 House and Senate races will begin in a few months?<br />Jeff Adams<br />Atlanta</td>

That’s what the University of Illinois now offers with our fully online iMBA program. We intentionally optimized the online experience, providing meaningful engagement with faculty and fellow students without requiring students to relocate or travel to campus. Our results speak for themselves: Although the program is only five years old, we had a record 4,000 applications from eager learners around the globe—a 75% increase over fall 2019. We’ve graduated more than 1,000 students from the program with a 97% student satisfaction rate. Although nearly all of our students are employed, more than half of them received a promotion or a new job opportunity during their time in our program.<br />We’ve embraced disruptive innovation in a sector that has traditionally been resistant, and the market has responded with enthusiasm—so much so, that we’ve expanded our online programs to include a master’s degree in accounting and another in management.<br />Employers still desire the skills provided by a high-quality M.B.A. education. By increasing access to the degree by lowering financial, geographic and other barriers, we have once again made the M.B.A. a high-value investment.<br />Jeffrey Brown</td>

He suggests that the best way to celebrate diversity is to begin by celebrating “diversity of thought,” which can stem from “the value of true merit, or the real abilities of the people chosen to perform their jobs.”<br />What seems amiss here is that Mr. Epstein seems to insinuate that the race, color and gender type of diversity happens often as a trade-off to merit and accomplishment. But as made obvious by the résumés of President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet picks, to think that a candidate is picked for a job based on a race, color or gender factor alone is an outdated notion. Merit is the sine qua non in these competitive times. If anything, race, color and gender just add to enriching the diversity of thought.<br />Heidi H. Cha<br />New York<br /></td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Trump administration is putting Cuba back on the list of countries that are considered to be state sponsors of terrorism, a senior U.S. official said, rescinding a 2015 move by the Obama administration to thaw ties to the onetime Cold War adversary.<br />The redesignation, which will be announced Monday, may complicate President-elect Joe Biden’s efforts to improve ties with Havana. It is the latest in a series of foreign policy steps the administration has taken in recent days to try to lock in policies before it leaves office.<br />The State Department list to which Cuba is being added includes Syria, Iran and North Korea. Cuba was removed from that list in 2015 as the Obama administration sought to build ties with the country, part of a campaign that included boosting commercial air travel, the reopening of embassies and a visit by President Obama to the country.<br />Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to argue that the move is justified because Cuba has given refuge to an American convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in 1973 and to cite other complaints against the Cuban government.<br />A formal administration statement explaining the decision is expected to be issued later on Monday.</td>

The organization, with a membership of more than 70,000, according to its website, is the largest voluntary bar association in the U.S.<br />While any lawyer who is disbarred is automatically stripped of membership, a spokeswoman for the organization, Susan DeSantis, said this is the first time the group has opened an inquiry into a current member since it adopted its bylaws in the 1970s.<br />The bar association said its inquiry will examine whether Mr. Giuliani’s actions during and after the presidential election violated the organization’s bylaws. The bar association said it had received hundreds of complaints in recent months about Mr. Giuliani stemming from his “baseless efforts” to cast doubt on the presidential election and overturn its results.<br />Last week, as Congress gathered to certify the results of the election, Mr. Giuliani spoke to crowds of thousands of Trump supporters at a Washington, D.C. rally, urging them to fight on. The bar association cited Mr. Giuliani’s exhortation to the crowds at Mr. Trump’s rally: “Let’s have trial by combat.”</td>

      <td>LONDON—Britain’s National Health Service is bracing for the worst weeks of the pandemic as a new, more-contagious form of the coronavirus rips through the country and places hospitals under more extreme stress than in the spring.<br />A combination of a more infectious version of the virus, less compliance with social-distancing restrictions and changing hospital procedures have created a storm for the state-run health service as it tries to weather a surge of Covid-19 infections.<br />“I think this situation is really, really serious. It is deteriorating rapidly,” said Dr. Daniele Bryden, a doctor and vice dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. “We know this is going to be a very difficult three weeks.”<br />The new variant—which scientists estimate is between 50% and 70% more transmissible than older versions—has combined with gatherings over Christmas to push daily new reported cases to record levels, government scientists say. New cases appear to be flattening out at high levels, but it will take time before any benefits feed through to hospitals.<br />There are now more people in the hospital than in any phase of the pandemic last April, with 32,300 Covid-19 patients hospitalized at present compared with around 21,700 in the spring.</td>

Previous efforts, including a deal worth $6.3 billion five years ago, were blocked by antitrust enforcers. The latest offer was made public Monday by Staples.<br />The  ODP Corp. ,  Office Depot ’s  parent company, said its board of directors is reviewing the proposal and will consider potential antitrust and regulatory challenges.<br />The retail landscape has changed since the companies’ last attempt to merge, with  Amazon.com Inc.  expanding deeper into office supplies and the Covid-19 pandemic leaving many people working or learning from home. Both Office Depot and Staples have large e-commerce operations, but Office Depot’s revenue has suffered as many corporate offices have been closed. Closely held Staples doesn’t disclose its financial results.<br />After the last failed deal, Staples was taken private by Sycamore Partners, a hedge fund that has scooped up battered retail chains, in a leveraged buyout in 2017.

Margin trades use borrowed money to amplify investments.<br />The order came as bitcoin approached an all-time high of $41,962 on Friday, after more than tripling in 2020. Over the weekend, the world’s leading cryptocurrency went in reverse, shedding around a quarter of its value, and recently traded for $31,400, according to data from CoinDesk.<br />The move by eToro shows the topsy-turvy world of cryptocurrencies, where rapid price swings—often with little or no catalyst—can surprise investors and brokerages that cater to them. With margin trading, as an asset’s value increases, investors can increase their leverage, but also expose themselves and the brokerage to losses in the case of rapid pullback in prices.<br />The online brokerage said it had seen a frenzy of cryptocurrency activity in recent weeks. It added about 200,000 new registered users in the first week of the year, during which its platform saw several days of cryptocurrency trading volumes that were at 10 times the average of last year.</td>

The riot left five people dead and turned any interaction with the White House and commander in chief into an even more fraught decision than it has been at any point in the past four years.<br />The PGA of America said late Sunday it was stripping Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, N.J., of the 2022 PGA Championship. On Monday, the R&A, the body that oversees events such as the British Open, also said it had no plans to stage its championships at Turnberry, a golf resort in Scotland owned by Trump that has hosted four British Opens and two Women’s British Opens.<br />“We will not return until we are convinced that the focus will be on the championship, the players and the course itself and we do not believe that is achievable in the current circumstances,” Martin Slumbers, chief executive of the R&A, said in a statement.<br />Now, individuals like Belichick are left with the task of deciding whether to accept prestigious honors from Trump in the final days of his presidency—as Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, call for his removal in the wake of last week’s attack on the Capitol.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court rejected pleas from President Trump and his allies to expedite their pending challenges to November’s election, all but assuring the justices won’t consider the appeals before Joe Biden assumes the presidency Jan. 20.<br />In unsigned orders issued Monday, the court without comment denied requests to expedite more than half a dozen cases seeking to overturn Mr. Biden’s victories in states including Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. By leaving them on the regular calendar, the Trump appeals won’t be scheduled for consideration until late January at earliest.<br />The justices are under no obligation to hear the cases, and few legal observers expect that they will.<br />The court’s action comes after a pro-Trump mob invaded the U.S. Capitol  Wednesday in a failed effort to thwart confirmation of Mr. Biden’s victory. After authorities reclaimed the Capitol, Congress reassembled to reject challenges to Biden victories in Arizona and Pennsylvania and then certified the Electoral College vote, 306 for Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump’s 232.<br />State and federal courts rejected more than 50 suits challenging Mr. Biden’s victories on various grounds. Those included procedural flaws, such as waiting too long before challenging election rules set months or more earlier, and substantive grounds, namely the failure to produce material evidence of fraud or misconduct after millions voted.</td>

Catholic women around the world have served as lectors and acolytes, kinds of liturgical assistants, for decades.<br />But until the new papal decree, released Monday, individual local bishops have been able to restrict those roles to men in their dioceses by citing church law.<br />Pope Francis wrote that codifying women’s participation in those roles would raise awareness “of the precious contribution that many lay persons, including women, have been offering for some time to the life and mission of the church.”<br />Pope Francis stressed that the roles of reader and altar server are lay ministries and thus don’t require ministers to be ordained as clergy.</td>

      <td>Congressional threats and inducements make Twitter and Facebook censorship a free-speech violation.</td>
      <td>Facebook  and  Twitter  banned President Trump and numerous supporters after last week’s disgraceful Capitol riot, and Google, Apple and  Amazon  blocked Twitter alternative Parler—all based on claims of “incitement to violence” and “hate speech.” Silicon Valley titans cite their ever-changing “terms of service,” but their selective enforcement suggests political motives.<br />Conventional wisdom holds that technology companies are free to regulate content because they are private, and the First Amendment protects only against government censorship. That view is wrong: Google, Facebook and Twitter should be treated as state actors under existing legal doctrines. Using a combination of statutory inducements and regulatory threats, Congress has co-opted Silicon Valley to do through the back door what government cannot directly accomplish under the Constitution.<br />It is “axiomatic,” the Supreme Court held in Norwood v. Harrison (1973), that the government “may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.” That’s what Congress did by enacting Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which not only permits tech companies to censor constitutionally protected speech but immunizes them from liability if they do so.<br />The justices have long held that the provision of such immunity can turn private action into state action. In Railway Employees’ Department v. Hanson (1956), they found state action in private union-employer closed-shop agreements—which force all employees to join the union—because Congress had passed a statute immunizing such agreements from liability under state law. In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association(1989), the court again found state action in private-party conduct—drug tests for company employees—because federal regulations immunized railroads from liability if they conducted those tests. In both cases, as with Section 230, the federal government didn’t mandate anything; it merely pre-empted state law, protecting certain private parties from lawsuits if they engaged in the conduct Congress was promoting.<br />Section 230 is the carrot, and there’s also a stick: Congressional Democrats have repeatedly made explicit threats to social-media giants if they failed to censor speech those lawmakers disfavored. In April 2019, Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond warned Facebook and Google that they had “better” restrict what he and his colleagues saw as harmful content or face regulation: “We’re going to make it swift, we’re going to make it strong, and we’re going to hold them very accountable.” New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler added: “Let’s see what happens by just pressuring them.”</td>

      <td>Yes, the left does bad things too. Conservatives are supposed to believe in objective moral truth.</td>
      <td>It’s a measure of the depravity to which our national political conversation has fallen that however bad one side’s latest transgression against norms, morality or the law, there’s always something it can point to that the other side did first. The earlier outrage may not exactly justify the latest offense. But by reminding an already highly partisan audience that there is prior sinfulness in the actions of your opponents, you can dilute the negative public impact of your own wrongdoing or, at a minimum, apply some balm to a troubled private conscience.<br />This equivalence play, or “whataboutism,” can, if we’re not careful, neuter all efforts to hold our leaders’ actions to some objective standard. It inflicts on all judgments the terminal paralysis of moral relativism. As with the widespread undermining of objective factual truth in recent years, so the erosion of the idea of objective moral truth steadily weakens the foundations of political and civil community and softens us up for a final descent into the invented truths of totalitarianism.<br />In the wake of last week’s violent incursion at the U.S. Capitol, President Trump’s supporters have been working overtime on the moral-equivalence shift.<br />Sure, the president’s claims of a stolen election are dubious, but they’re nothing worse than what Democrats and the media did for four years in promoting the false Russia-collusion story, refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Trump presidency, and trying to destroy it.<br />Yes, the violence at the Capitol was terrible, but so too was the mayhem perpetrated by Black Lives Matter and antifa in dozens of American cities last summer.</td>

They are fearful of triggering lease provisions that kick in when key anchor retailers or a certain number of tenants leave a certain property, cutting rents for those that remain.<br />“In light of the pandemic, people are worried about empty stores and worried about traffic in their malls,” said Saul Burian, managing director at investment bank  Houlihan Lokey Inc.  “Some are even worried about hitting thresholds of vacancies that could have other consequences either with respect to other tenants, or with respect to their debt.”<br />Landlords who feel that they won’t be able to quickly replace tenants have the least leverage in negotiations, said Beth Azor, founder and owner of commercial real-estate advisory and investment firm Azor Advisory Services Inc., which owns and manages six shopping centers in South Florida.</td>

The news boosted Lilly’s market value by nearly $20 billion.<br />Those benefits will need to be confirmed in a larger trial. Sadly, the drug industry has had several prospective Alzheimer’s drugs that showed promise and created stock market gains but eventually fizzled out. The Lilly data are from just 272 patients.<br />Of course, the financial benefits of being the first to crack the code would be massive. There are 5 million Americans currently living with the fatal disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. The population is aging, so that figure is likely headed higher in the years ahead. The disease has a severe impact on quality of life, so demand would be high even for a drug that just slows disease progression.<br />Lilly now has a chance to be first in class. U.S. regulators are set to decide whether to approve Biogen’s experimental treatment aducanumab by March 7. But an advisory panel of outside experts convened by the Food and Drug Administration in November voted overwhelmingly that the best available data doesn’t show the drug is sufficiently effective.</td>

      <td>With the pandemic overloading many emergency rooms and ICUs, the hospital isn’t always the best place to seek treatment for some ailments</td>
      <td>With emergency rooms and ICUs across the country overloaded, a trip to the hospital can mean greater pandemic-related risks. According to the Covid Tracking Project, more than 132,000 people are in hospital with Covid-19, with the majority of states reporting record hospitalizations. That affects not just emergency departments but staffing and space throughout entire hospitals, which usually isolate Covid patients to prevent infection.<br />That is complicating the decision to go to the emergency room. Here’s what doctors and other medical authorities advise.<br />When are urgent-care clinics the best option?<br />If you aren’t experiencing heart attack or stroke symptoms, some lesser emergencies may be easier addressed outside the ER, said Andra Blomkalns, chair of the emergency medicine department at Stanford University. This is critical if hospitals in your area are near capacity. “If you have a sprained ankle, it’s probably not the time to go to the hospital,” she said. Many urgent-care clinics also post waiting times and can do sutures, X-rays and other diagnostic testing.<br />Remember that your gut reaction can be misleading. Research shows that people can’t always judge whether they are experiencing a health emergency, said Charleen Hsuan, professor of health policy and administration at Pennsylvania State University, adding, “in general, patients aren’t necessarily good at telling when something is a real emergency or not.”</td>

      <td>Scientists say even vaccinated people need to take Covid precautions</td>
      <td>Do the Covid vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus, or do they just protect you from getting sick?<br />Scientists don’t know yet—and the uncertainty has big implications during the rollout of the vaccines.<br />Pfizer  and Moderna, the companies that developed the vaccines authorized in the U.S. so far, say their vaccines are about 95% effective at preventing people from getting sick with Covid symptoms. But there’s not enough evidence yet on whether the vaccines also prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission.<br />The companies say research is ongoing to determine the answer. Without vaccines, research has suggested that asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus that causes Covid is responsible for roughly a quarter of infections.<br />The result, experts say, is that precautions like wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding crowded spaces will be necessary until the country gets closer to herd immunity, the point at which enough people are immune to a disease to make its spread unlikely. Some studies have estimated roughly 75% to 80% of the U.S. population needs to be immune to Covid-19 to reach herd immunity, but that number is a moving target and could rise as new variants emerge.</td>

      <td>TEL AVIV—Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he ordered his government to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank, an early test for the administration of President-elect Joe Biden who has been a fierce critic of projects built on land that the Palestinians claim for a future state.<br />The government will approve or advance plans for 800 homes in several different settlements, including in one that the Israeli government has yet to formally recognize, Mr. Netanyahu said Monday. “We’re here to stay,” he said on  Facebook .  “We’re continuing to build the land of Israel.”<br />The announcement comes as Mr. Netanyahu courts right-wing votes in an upcoming election, and rushes to offer inducements before close ally President Trump leaves office. Recent polls suggest Mr. Netanyahu will need to retain and expand his support among the right-wing and religious camps if he is to fight off his challenger and retain his post as Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.<br />Mr. Netanyahu’s path to forming a coalition is narrowing, according to a poll released Monday by Israel’s Radio 103 FM. Without the New Hope party led by a former ally-turned-rival, Gideon Saar, and another right-wing party headed by Naftali Bennett, his coalition has only 46 seats. He needs 61 to form a government.<br />Mr. Saar on Monday urged Mr. Netanyahu to recognize Jewish settlements in the West Bank that are considered illegal under Israeli law.</td>

It is an emerging rival to two, long-dominant proprietary models from  Intel Corp.  and Arm Holdings Ltd., a British company that U.S. graphics-chip maker  Nvidia Inc.  agreed in September to acquire for $40 billion.<br />The standard is winning global interest, and early users include Chinese online retail and tech giant  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , which developed what some industry insiders consider the highest-performance RISC-V chip in production. Alibaba has said it is using that chip in its data centers to perform artificial intelligence calculations, and is selling versions of it.<br />Widespread adoption of RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” could open the door for China to accelerate efforts to end its dependence on Western chip technology, threaten licensing revenues for Arm and could aid the rise of new rivals to incumbent chip makers, industry executives and analysts said.<br />“China wants to have its own architecture, but also an architecture where license fees won’t have to be paid.

      <td>WASHINGTON—The storming of the Capitol by President Trump’s supporters is expected to turbocharge Congressional efforts to regulate big tech—and many lawmakers are expected to focus on scaling back the liability shield that protects internet companies.<br />The Capitol incursion, some of which was planned and discussed in advance on social media, has hardened many Democrats’ view that a lack of tech-platform regulation is undermining democracy. Georgia’s election of two Democratic Senators last week shifted a divided Congress to Democrats’ control, improving the chances of passing legislation targeting consumer-data privacy, tech companies’ market power and the liability shield known as Section 230.<br />“The bottom line is that the odds of legislative action on privacy, antitrust and 230 just went up significantly,” said Blair Levin, a policy analyst with equity research firm New Street Research. “The party that wants to legislate now has the power to put a bill on the Senate floor, and on all those issues there are Republicans likely to join with Democrats.”<br />Republicans have their own issues with big internet companies, asserting that they are abusing their power to silence conservative voices on their platforms. Many Republicans support rewriting Section 230, and some claim that tech companies are shifting further left to appease Democrats expanding their power in Washington.<br />After the Capitol riot,  Twitter Inc.  permanently banned Mr. Trump and  Facebook Inc.  indefinitely suspended him, citing his role in fanning violence, while  Apple Inc.,   Amazon.com Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google cut off support for the Parler social-media app on grounds that it doesn’t adequately police content that could incite violence.</td>

That compares to clinical trial results out of Brazil last week showing the vaccine had an efficacy rate of 78%.<br />Indonesia’s trial showed that CoronVac was safe, with participants experiencing only minor side effects like fatigue and fever, according to Penny Lukito, the head of Indonesia’s National Agency of Drug and Food Control. “Hopefully vaccines for Covid-19 will be one of the factors in overcoming this pandemic,” she said.<br />A rate of 65% exceeds the 50% threshold that the World Health Organization and many regulatory authorities consider necessary for widespread use. Western vaccines developed by Moderna Inc. and jointly by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have reported their vaccines to be more than 90% effective; another developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca PLC was at least 62% effective, according to the team.<br />Authorities in Brazil have yet to approve CoronaVac for use, although President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration has backed down from its previous criticism of Chinese vaccines and agreed to buy up to 100 million shots of the vaccine.</td>

      <td>Southern European austerity budgets left the region ill-prepared for the virus</td>
      <td>MILAN—Claudio Zanon has seen firsthand how less spending on health care in recent years left Italy exposed when the coronavirus began sweeping through his country early last year.<br />Dr. Zanon, who until the end of December was the medical director at a hospital in Como in Italy’s hard-hit Lombardy region, says when the pandemic arrived he didn’t have enough doctors and nurses. Intensive-care unit beds were scarce and there wasn’t a large network of local clinics to help take the strain. With money tight, technology used in the hospital had also fallen behind.<br />“Italy was unprepared when the first coronavirus wave hit because the health-care system hasn’t received adequate funding in recent years,” said Dr. Zanon, who practiced as a surgeon for three decades. “If investments don’t keep up, you will inevitably see the negative results at a certain point.”<br />Lower relative spending on health care in the wake of the financial crisis became a fixture of the past decade in Italy and other Southern European countries. Budgetary belt tightening partly explains why some countries suffered higher infection rates and death tolls in the pandemic, according to health-care experts and doctors who have been on the front line treating patients.<br />Per capita private and public spending on health care, adjusted for inflation, fell by 2.6% in Italy between 2009 and 2019, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Greece, it plunged by almost a third. Health-care costs tend to rise faster than overall inflation, because of the rising health-care needs of aging populations as well as technological advances, so even keeping spending constant often requires cutting something, such as staff or services offered.</td>

But the potential rewards for manufacturers come with a sting.<br />Shares in Hyundai Motor Company rose 9% Monday after a Korean newspaper reported that the car maker plans to sign an agreement with Apple for an autonomous electric vehicle. The stock had already jumped 19% on Friday, when Hyundai said it was in early-stage discussions with the iPhone designer.<br />Apple started to work on a vehicle in 2014, but the project has progressed fitfully and the company has rarely acknowledged it publicly. A Reuters report last month said it was targeting a 2024 launch, which would be very ambitious for anything with a meaningful degree of autonomy. Hyundai would likely be a production partner, akin to the role Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn plays in iPhone assembly.<br />For all the glamour—and potential manufacturing volumes—of being associated with an Apple-branded car, the almost $15 billion gain in Hyundai’s market value since Thursday’s close is hard to justify. Besides the risks that the talks come to nothing, or that any project drains cash for longer than expected, contract manufacturing isn’t an especially attractive business.<br />Canadian supplier  Magna International ,  which is also seen as a potential partner for Apple, assembles vehicles under other brands, notably the Jaguar I-Pace, an all-electric sport-utility vehicle.

That will support development and marketing of the Bakkt App, which is envisioned as a tool to let people manage their holdings of various digital assets. These could include bitcoin, loyalty points and reward programs, like those offered by  Starbucks Corp.  and airlines, and virtual assets from videogames.<br />More than 400,000 people preregistered for the app, which is expected to have a wide public rollout in March, Bakkt says.

For golf equipment and bicycles, sales grew 75% and more than 50% in the same period, respectively.<br />Compared with newly popular pursuits such as at-home workouts, outdoor activity is more likely to endure in popularity in part because it was a growing trend even when people were packing concert venues, cruise ships and airplanes: Wholesale camping-equipment sales have grown steadily from 2007 to 2018, according to a study published by the National Park Service.<br />One-quarter of North American campers indicated that their first camping experience occurred since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a survey taken in September by Kampgrounds of America, a system of privately held campgrounds. New camping and outdoor recreation habits can lead to add-on purchases over time.<br />For 2021 specifically, outdoor recreation is likely to appeal to both consumers skittish about re-entering packed venues and those seeking value for money. The outdoor-recreation economy held steady in the aftermath of the 2007-09 recession, according to the Outdoor Industry Association, which notes that the industry grew roughly 5% annually on average between 2005 and 2011.</td>

      <td>The magazine has added an editor’s note saying three leading figures in the article made false claims</td>
      <td>TOKYO—A New Yorker staff writer who researched a “family rental” service in Japan expressed concern before publication that her sources might not be telling the truth, according to people who spoke with her.<br />The New Yorker won a National Magazine Award in feature writing for the April 2018 article, “A Theory of Relativity,” by staff writer Elif Batuman. In December, it added an editor’s note saying three leading figures in the article made false claims that broadly undermined their credibility.<br />The magazine’s internal investigation, which took a year and a half, prompted other news organizations to review their coverage of a business called Family Romance, whose owner says he rents out actors to play various roles including fake family members. The British Broadcasting Corp. and the Associated Press have removed videos they published in 2019 featuring the business.<br />Family Romance owner Yuichi Ishii garnered extensive international media coverage over the past decade by telling colorful stories about his business. It was the subject of a 2019 movie by German director Werner Herzog as well as a comic segment in which television host Conan O’Brien rented a family on his visit to Japan. Mr. Ishii says on his website that his services include sending an actor to scold people who feel guilty about a transgression and want a proper chastising.<br />People who have dealt with Mr. Ishii said some of his services were real but the people he introduced to the media as customers were often themselves actors.</td>

      <td>Investment firm  KKR  & Co. is joining the music-copyright buying frenzy, investing in pop producer Ryan Tedder’s catalog of hits, including songs from Beyoncé, Adele and Stevie Wonder.<br />The firm is taking a majority stake, valuing the catalog at nearly $200 million, according to people familiar with the transaction. The deal includes a mix of certain copyrights and royalty streams for some 500 songs written, recorded or produced by Mr. Tedder for his band OneRepublic and other artists.<br />KKR’s entree into music-copyright ownership comes amid a flurry of deals for songwriting catalogs. Late in 2020, Stevie Nickssold an 80% stake in her songwriting copyrights to music publisher Primary Wave, valuing her catalog at $100 million. Bob Dylan then sold off over 600 songs to  Vivendi  SE’s Universal Music Group for between $300 million and $400 million. In the first week of the new year, music-investment company  Hipgnosis Songs Fund Ltd.  announced deals to purchase copyrights from Jimmy Iovine, Lindsey Buckingham and Neil Young. Mr. Young’s sale alone fetched a price between $40 million and $50 million for a 50% stake, according to people familiar with the deal.<br />In 2016, Mr. Tedder sold part of his publishing, excluding OneRepublic, to Downtown Music Holdings, which will continue to own and administer those copyrights. Universal Music Group’s Interscope Records also owns master recording copyrights to OneRepublic’s recorded music; KKR will participate in Mr. Tedder’s and the band’s royalty income from that music, as well as producer royalties from other recorded assets.<br />KKR has been invested in the music industry since 2009, including its purchase of Gibson Brands—which recently acquired amp maker Mesa/Boogie—and stakes in TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd., BMG, and Alpha Theta, formerly Pioneer DJ. It is actively pursuing further investments across music and entertainment, including intellectual property such as song compositions, the company said.</td>

      <td>Slow approval from Beijing is dragging out big technology deals, costing American companies time and money</td>
      <td>Patience may be a virtue. For U.S. tech companies looking to do deals that involve China, it is also an expensive necessity.<br />Cisco Systems  and  Applied Materials  each received different lessons on that score last week. On Friday, Cisco found its $2.6 billion deal to buy  Acacia Communications  in serious jeopardy after Acaia announced it was terminating the merger due to a lack of approval from Chinese regulators. Cisco’s unusual response was that it did, in fact, receive the necessary approval, and it is now seeking a court mandate that would prevent the deal from being terminated. The deal was first struck in July 2019 and was Cisco’s largest acquisition since its $3.7 billion pickup of AppDynamics more than two years prior.<br />Applied Materials took a different tack. The maker of semiconductor manufacturing gear earlier in the week announced in a regulatory filing that it has upped its price for Kokusai Electric to $3.5 billion from the $2.2 billion the two companies first agreed upon in June 2019. That deal is also only awaiting approval from Chinese regulators. With its higher price, Applied was able to extend the deadline to close the merger to March 19 from its original date of Dec. 30.<br />Both cases are just the latest sign of soured trade relations between the U.S. and China. The departing Trump administration has continued to pursue aggressive actions, such as export controls on Chinese chipmaking giant SMIC and an order requiring the delisting of three Chinese telecommunications companies from the New York Stock Exchange.<br />Chinese authorities have found another—and perhaps more subtle—way to make life difficult for U.S. tech companies in return.  Qualcomm  had to terminate its $44 billion acquisition of  NXP Semiconductors  in mid-2018 after the deal failed to gain the necessary clearance from China.  Nvidia  took more than a year to gain the needed Chinese approval of its purchase of Mellanox, and the company said last month it expects its pending acquisition of Arm Holdings to take 18 months from that deal’s announcement date in mid-September.</td>

      <td>Social-media service Parler vanished just before midnight Sunday Pacific time, when  Amazon.com Inc.  followed through on its threat to stop hosting the public-messaging platform that has exploded in popularity among supporters of President Trump.<br />The effective disappearance of Parler shows the growing breadth and effect of efforts by big technology companies to restrict content they label as dangerous after last week’s mob attack on the U.S. Capitol. Amazon had said in a letter to Parler over the weekend that it had seen a steady increase in violent content on the site and said Parler’s efforts to remove it were inadequate.<br />Parler’s effective disappearance came shortly after Apple Inc. and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google removed the Parler app for mobile devices from their app stores—making it difficult for new users to download—without shutting down the service. Amazon’s move had a far more severe impact because it provides the back-end servers that host Parler’s website and databases, as it does for a large array of other prominent companies.<br />Parler Chief Executive John Matze didn’t respond to an email sent to his parler.com email address, or to a message sent via his LinkedIn profile. But he said in a post on Parler on Saturday that it was possible the service would be unavailable for as long as a week while it found new hosting services.<br />“This was a coordinated attack by the tech giants to kill competition in the marketplace,” Mr. Matze wrote.</td>

      <td>One niche segment of China’s unloved property sector still has the government strongly in its corner</td>
      <td>The post-pandemic year is shaping up as a tricky one for Chinese companies in the great real-estate game—at least the building part of it. Companies managing existing buildings, on the other hand, are suddenly shaping up as hot property themselves.<br />The MSCI China Real Estate index fell 16% last year as state media reported a new “three red lines” policy for home builders, new regulatory benchmarks for financial health, with the aim of controlling excessive debt. One niche segment of the industry, however, apparently still has the government in its corner. Ten government bureaus released policies last week supporting the property-management industry, including broadening service scope and more market-based pricing.<br />The policy tailwinds have added to an already frothy rally in property-management stocks. Shares of Ever Sunshine Lifestyle Services, for example, are 12 times the price they were at the end of 2018. Country Garden Services shares have more than quintupled over the same period.<br />But what has got investors really excited is that the government is supporting two big potential growth drivers. The first is so-called value-added services that go beyond traditional property management. Those include household cleaning, babysitting or elderly care. Such value-added services revenue grew 39% from a year earlier in the first half of 2020, according to Citi. These services have been further ramped up during Covid-19. State-owned  Poly Property Services ,  for example, launched a service delivering fresh produce.<br />Another growth driver is industry consolidation. While many management companies originally served properties their developer parents built, they are starting to get revenue from smaller developers too. Mergers have picked up. Ongoing consolidation of the industry may help drive growth through economies of scale or improved pricing power even if new-home sales slow.</td>

Andrew Obenshain, currently Bluebird’s president of severe genetic diseases, will become its chief executive, the company said.<br />The separation is expected to close in the fourth quarter, the company said.<br />“We built this powerful product engine, and the question is: ‘What is the best way to think about the next five to 10 years?’ ” Mr. Leschly said in an interview. “We don’t believe the past is the best way to head into the future.”<br />The restructuring comes as Bluebird struggles to match its scientific achievements advancing its drug pipeline with commercial success.

Individual investors gather to talk about hot stocks like  Tesla Inc.,  boast of gains and commiserate about losses.<br />These investors do more than just talk, though. They piggyback on each others’ ideas and trades, helping fuel the momentum that has propelled some companies to triple-digit or bigger gains in 2020.<br />“People fall in love with [some stocks] and they get in these echo chambers, where they are all shouting, like, ‘We’re going to buy Tesla forever!’” said Blake Bassett, a 31-year-old delivery driver who began trading several years ago. “People post all day like it’s a football game.”<br />And while online discussions among investors aren’t necessarily new—in the late 1990s internet chat rooms dedicated to stocks helped sustain the tech-stock bubble—social media is more widespread than ever before. That, meanwhile, has coincided with an industrywide move to commission-free trading, while most brokerages have made it easier to dabble in risky instruments like options.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—In his nearly four years in office, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer helped move protectionism from the fringes of American policy-making to the core. His advice to the Biden administration: Stay the course.<br />Keep tariffs on China—all of them—even if that raises prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, he said. Weaken the World Trade Organization so that it can’t overrule U.S. policies, and make it harder for American companies to move overseas despite the cost to their competitiveness.<br />In an interview, Mr. Lighthizer credited the Trump administration with taking a tough approach toward Chinese trade practices that benefited U.S. workers—ending years of accommodation by previous administrations fearful of angering Beijing.<br />“We changed the way people think about China,” Mr. Lighthizer said. “We want a China policy that thinks about the geopolitical competition between the United States and an adversary—an economic adversary.”<br />The 73-year-old Mr. Lighthizer—tall, gravelly voiced and pugnacious—was the engineer who helped steer the Trump administration’s economic confrontation with China. He turned President Trump’s anger at Beijing into a two-year trade war where he deployed tariffs on a scale not seen since the 1930s.</td>

In some cases, prices paid on the ground for cargoes have exceeded the levels indicated by Platts.<br />“It is a perfect storm,” said Toby Dunipace, executive director for LNG at London shipbroker Simpson Spence Young.

      <td>SEOUL—Kim Jong Un has given himself a lofty new title and removed his ascendant sister from North Korea’s inner circle of powerful elites.<br />On the sixth day of a rare Workers’ Party Congress meeting, Mr. Kim was elevated from chairman to general secretary, a rank previously held by his late father and grandfather. North Korean state media described the role as “the brain of the revolution.” But as a practical matter, Mr. Kim’s control over the cloistered regime remains as absolute as ever.<br />Meanwhile, Kim Yo Jong, the leader’s younger sister and a confidante, wasn’t named to the Politburo, the party’s top decision-making body, in an apparent demotion from her prior standing as an alternative member. Some Pyongyang experts had expected Ms. Kim could be promoted to a full-time seat.<br />Ms. Kim’s removal from the Politburo reinforces that North Korea is run by a single person, rather than any codified system or set of rules, said Park Won-gon, an international studies professor at South Korea’s Handong Global University. The decision also brings potential benefits to Mr. Kim, he adds.<br />“Kim Jong Un might think that it is better not to give an official position for his sister because if he did, she could grab her own power network,” Mr. Park said.</td>

      <td>Star power of dictator’s sister has risen after appearances at 2018 Winter Olympics, two nuclear summits and as a signatory in state media</td>
      <td>Kim Yo Jong, 32 years old, is a senior North Korean official helping oversee the country’s policies toward the U.S. and South Korea, according to Seoul’s intelligence agency.<br />She is often at her brother’s side during key events in the one-party state. Among her various titles, Ms. Kim is the nominal head of the North’s propaganda and agitation department. She rose to prominence in just the past several years, attending all three face-to-face meetings between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as the latter’s confidante and adviser. She was an alternate member of North Korea’s Politburo until January 2021, though North Korea experts say the apparent demotion still leaves her political clout unchanged.<br />In 2020, she began signing off on official government statements that criticized Washington’s insistence on complete denuclearization of her country, and Seoul’s failure to rein in North Korean defectors who sent antiregime leaflets over the two Koreas’ shared border.<br />Kim Yo Jong’s precise date of birth is unknown, though South Korea’s Unification Ministry database of North Korean officials lists her as being born in 1988 in Pyongyang. She is the younger sister of Kim Jong Un and the youngest-known daughter of their father Kim Jong Il, who ruled North Korea from 1994 to 2011 and had children with several women. During her earliest years, Ms. Kim was an obscure figure. But that changed in 2009, when Kim Jong Un was rumored to have been named heir to the North Korean leadership, after their father suffered a series of strokes. That year, a side-by-side photograph was shown on state media, showing a presumed image of her, alongside Kim Jong Un and their eldest full brother, Kim Jong Chol. News cameras also spotted her in early 2011, when she attended an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore with Jong Chol.<br />Her marital status is unknown, though some South Korean news outlets have mentioned she may have married the son of a prominent North Korean official, Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Jong Un’s deputy in the state affairs commission—the government’s most-powerful decision-making apparatus. She hasn’t been publicly seen with a husband in North Korean state media. Ms. Kim steadily gained international prominence as Kim Jong Un accelerated North Korea’s nuclear weapons development over the past decade, participating in nuclear negotiations involving the U.S. and South Korea since 2018. In 2020, when her brother was rumored to be seriously ill, North Korea experts mentioned her as a possible emergency backup, if her brother abruptly died, or was incapacitated.</td>

      <td>Interviewers and candidates often end up in situations where they’re almost encouraged to lie—here’s what research says about how, why and how often it happens</td>
      <td>Is a job interview really an exercise in deception? Career coaches and researchers who study falsehoods say yes.<br />It’s no wonder, really. Even as children we’re socialized to tell white lies about the gifts that Grandma brings or how dinner tastes. Job interviews are simply a high-stakes extension of that dynamic, says Robert Feldman, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and author of the book “The Liar in Your Life.”<br />“It’s a situation almost designed to encourage lying,” he says. Candidates must put their best foot forward, and managers need to sell the job. Some companies say they want radical honesty, but do they really? “It is part of being a well-socialized person in our society to use lies to make other people feel good about themselves and to present ourselves effectively,” Dr. Feldman says.<br />One study finds that people would exaggerate all manner of things when going for a new role, from the responsibilities they had in previous jobs to their reasons for quitting. Of course, mistruths exist on a spectrum, from slight exaggerations to complete fabrications. Sometimes omissions can help to avert potential bias. Other times, they can wreak havoc, even destroying careers.<br />Follow along with our fictional job interview as we dissect the obfuscations, misdirects and bold-faced lies coming from both sides, with analysis drawn from recent academic research and conversations with career experts.</td>

      <td>Silicon Valley’s moves to eject President Trump from social media represent a display of power the companies have avoided making for nearly four years. Now  Twitter Inc.,   Facebook Inc.  and others must reckon with what comes next.<br />In a span of a couple of days, Twitter and Facebook—Mr. Trump’s main social-media megaphones—took action to silence the president’s personal accounts or online communities devoted to him, citing rules prohibiting content that incites violence. They were joined by companies such as  Snap Inc.  and Reddit Inc.<br />Apple Inc.,   Amazon.com Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google also took steps to boot Parler, a social-media app and website that has grown in popularity among conservatives—and which some rioters had used to promote Wednesday’s attack at the U.S. Capitol, according to screenshots viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The actions against Mr. Trump and Parler illustrate more starkly than ever the companies’ influence over conversation online—and the political nature of their decisions. While lauded by many, ejecting the president and some of his supporters also infuriated others who said it amounts to censorship, and the moves risked driving off some users in a way that, especially for Twitter, could reshape their businesses. It also illustrates the political nature of how they determine what content to remove, what content to allow and what to amplify.<br />“Right or wrong, they made a political decision,” said Jonathon Hauenschild, director of the communications and technology task force for the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative nonprofit group, regarding the companies’ moves. Attention on the tech giants “was there to begin with. Now the spotlight is fully on,” he said.</td>

Some, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance group and  Marriott International Inc.,  said they would pause donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol on Wednesday. Congress certified Mr. Biden’s win early Thursday, ending attempts to overturn results in two states from seven Republican senators and more than 100 representatives.<br />The actions follow a week in which businesses and their chief executives have sought ways to ensure a peaceful transition of power, with some calling for Mr. Trump’s removal from office by invoking the 25th amendment or impeachment. Others say they are holding back on such action as they await Mr. Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20.<br />The announcements could reflect an acceleration of recent trends among large companies to limit or better disclose political spending.<br />JPMorgan, the largest bank in the country, made the decision to pause political giving because of the growing political crisis following the violence at the Capitol alongside health and economic crises, said Peter Scher, JPMorgan’s head of corporate responsibility, in an interview.</td>

Fliers promoting the event are circulating online, including one encouraging people to “come armed at your personal discretion.”<br />A website associated with some adherents of the antigovernment boogaloo movement said the coming event would be peaceful. “We have no plans to do anything to the capitol buildings in the cities in which we plan the demonstration,” the site said in a post on Friday. Followers of the movement were charged last year in the killing of law-enforcement officers and possessing Molotov cocktails.<br />Others online are touting a Million Militia March in Washington on Jan. 20, the day of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, according to screenshots provided by Meili Criezis, a research associate tracking violent extremism at American University.</td>

      <td>Tech’s stampede against the right will lead to more populist anger.</td>
      <td>Can right-wing populist sentiment be banished from American life by the brute force of social-media censorship? We’re about to find out. After Wednesday’s mob invasion of the Capitol that disrupted the counting of electoral votes, big tech firms have moved, aggressively and in unison, against Donald Trump and his supporters. The companies say they want to marginalize the violent fringe, but their censorship will grow it instead.<br />On Thursday and Friday came the  Facebook  and  Twitter  bans of Mr. Trump. Given the extraordinary circumstances, some commentators who normally oppose web censorship were untroubled.<br />An exception who deserves to be listened to is Alexei Navalny, the Russian democracy advocate and scourge of Vladimir Putin who was poisoned last year. He pointed out that, unlike the open election process that ousted Mr. Trump, social-media decisions to de-platform elected officials are unaccountable and arbitrary. “Don’t tell me he was banned for violating Twitter rules. I get death threats here every day for many years, and Twitter doesn’t ban anyone,” Mr. Navalny tweeted.<br />He added that while Twitter is a private company, “we have seen many examples in Russian and China of such private companies becoming the state’s best friends and enablers when it comes to censorship.”<br />Then the tech giants moved against Parler, Twitter’s free-speech competitor that is a haven for Trump supporters as well as more extreme figures. Google and  Apple  indefinitely booted Parler from their app stores over the weekend, crippling its viability on mobile phones. Then  Amazon  went for the kill, announcing that on Sunday it would withdraw its cloud service that Parler relies on to store data.</td>

      <td>Joe Biden promised at the end of the election campaign that he wouldn’t ban fracking for oil and natural gas. He’d merely forbid new oil and gas permits on federal land and waters. Pennsylvania voters who have benefited from a fracking boom may soon find out whether he meant it.<br />Progressives are calling on the Biden Administration to kill plans long underway for a port on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River in Gibbstown. The project is designed to allow natural gas extracted from the Marcellus Shale to be liquified and then transported by train to the port where it will be exported, mostly to the Caribbean.<br />Groups such as the Delaware Riverkeeper Network oppose the plans because they oppose all fossil fuels and any effort to make them more economical. So far they haven’t had much traction. The Army Corps of Engineers has approved the port, and in December the Delaware River Basin Commission gave its okay. Opponents now hope to get the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to block it.<br />They’re also working to block transport of the LNG. Last summer the Trump Administration approved a rule that allows LNG to be transported by rail. Activists are raising the specter of “train bombs” blowing up as they pass through cities such as Philadelphia.<br />A formal ban isn’t the only way to stop fracking. It can also be done by denying permits and raising costs and imposing delays via regulation. Reversing the Trump rule on train transport would put the squeeze on the industry by making it more expensive and inefficient to transport.</td>

      <td>While Joe Biden says he’ll work with U.S. allies to confront China, the allies get a say too. The European Union’s opening statement isn’t encouraging. After years of talks, China and the EU agreed in principle to the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in the final hours of 2020 after some late concessions from Beijing, which was eager to wrap up before Mr. Biden takes office.<br />The deal theoretically gives Europe more opportunities in China for automobiles, cloud computing, financial services, health care and telecom. It will level the “playing field for EU investors by laying down clear obligations on Chinese state-owned enterprises, prohibiting forced technology transfers and other distortive practices, and enhancing transparency of subsidies,” the European Commission said in a statement.<br />It’s reasonable for Europe to want to resolve issues like market access or intellectual-property theft, especially as the U.S. and Asian countries try the same. But the deal’s extensive flaws overwhelm its limited benefits. EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskisconceded after the deal was reached that the CAI is “not a panacea.” It doesn’t address, for example, longstanding grievances over steel overcapacity or the trade of counterfeit goods.<br />The larger question is whether Beijing will keep its word. The country’s behavior since joining the World Trade Organization—and especially over the past year—suggests Chinese President Xi Jinping isn’t worried about fulfilling obligations to other countries.<br />In the fight over human-rights provisions, China eventually agreed to “continued and sustained efforts” to ratify International Labor Organization conventions on forced labor. The chairman of the European Parliament’s China delegation tweeted, “That’s just a polite way of saying: ‘NO! Go [expletive] yourself!’” Don’t expect the Xinjiang labor camps to vanish.</td>

A literary agent told the  New York Times : “Trump doesn’t want to let go of his job, and a shockingly high number of us don’t want to let go of him.” Author Douglas Coupland smartly noted that “blame is just a lazy person’s way of making sense of chaos.”<br />Years ago, I believe the comedian Dennis Miller nailed it by saying—and I’ll clean it up—that blaming cigarette companies for getting cancer is like blaming your Members Only jacket for not getting dates in the ’80s. Blame yourself! Mr. Trump or Mrs. Pelosi may not be to your liking, but they weren’t the cause of all your problems. Everyone ought to stop projecting and look inward.

      <td>Was the car crash that killed Albert Camus and his publisher in 1960 an accident or an assassination engineered by the KGB?</td>
      <td>On Jan. 4, 1960, the world lost one of the most profound voices of the 20th century. Albert Camus, the 46-year-old author of “The Stranger” and “The Plague” and a recent winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, was riding in the passenger seat of a Facel Vega en route to Paris when the car swerved off the road and crashed into a tree. Camus died instantly, while the driver—Camus’s publisher, Michel Gallimard—would die from his injuries a few days later. The man who taught us how to face an absurd world had died an absurd death.<br />The Italian writer Giovanni Catelli contends that this was no accident. In his book “The Death of Camus,” first published in 2013 and translated into English by Andrew Tanzi, Mr. Catelli lays out the theory that Camus’s car crash was a political killing engineered by the KGB. Camus, Mr. Catelli notes, had issued various broadsides against the Soviet Union in the wake of its 1956 invasion of Hungary. Greatly charismatic and internationally revered, Camus posed a serious challenge to Moscow. He was, the author writes, “a free, indomitable and dangerous man.”<br />In short, staccato chapters, Mr. Catelli recounts his investigation into the circumstances surrounding Camus’s car crash. He also revisits the Soviet invasion of Hungary and Camus’s connection to a pair of literary figures: the Czech writer Jan Zábrana and the Russian writer Boris Pasternak. Mr. Catelli’s case is compelling but far from ironclad, and some readers will be more convinced than others. But his book provides a clear and useful window into the currents that political writers were forced to navigate during the Cold War.<br />Zábrana (1931-1984) is central to Mr. Catelli’s narrative. A poet and translator whose parents were persecuted by Czechoslovakia’s communist regime, he rendered Pasternak’s “Doctor Zhivago” into Czech. Mr. Catelli chances one day upon Zábrana’s posthumously published diaries in a Prague bookshop and alights on a passage from 1980, which reads: “I heard something very strange from a knowledgeable and well-connected man. He says the car crash that cost Camus his life in 1960 was set up by Soviet intelligence. They rigged the tyre with a tool that eventually pierced it when the car was travelling at high speed.”<br />Zábrana’s man (who wouldn’t reveal his source) told him that the order was issued by Soviet minister Dmitri Shepilov, in response to an article Camus wrote in March 1957 that attacked Shepilov over the events in Hungary. Mr. Catelli writes that Camus “let loose with all the indignation of a libertarian who refused to bow to tyranny.” He first attacked Shepilov in a speech delivered on Oct. 30, 1956, during a meeting of the exiled Spanish Republican government. He continued to denounce Moscow over the next few years; in 1958, he wrote the preface to “The Truth About the Nagy Affair,” a book published by the anticommunist Congress for Cultural Freedom refuting the charges brought against Imre Nagy, Hungary’s revolutionary prime minister, whom the Soviets executed for treason.</td>

      <td>Jan. 6 in Washington was a major fiasco for the Capitol Police, and to a lesser extent for the District of Columbia National Guard. Intelligence and planning were poor. It shouldn’t have been hard to anticipate that a mass convergence of many thousands of angry people could pose dangers at the site where all current members of Congress, as well as the incumbent and incoming vice presidents, were present. A mass casualty event could have occurred. Five people lost their lives; several more appropriately lost their jobs in the aftermath.<br />But even if police had been better prepared, preserving order would have been a challenge. Officers on the ground were quickly outnumbered by protesters, and they didn’t want to shoot fellow Americans on the grounds of Congress. As a former Hill staffer, I have long admired the Capitol Police, who preserve public access to the “people’s branch” of government even as they protect those of us, most of all the nation’s elected lawmakers, who work there. Beijing and Moscow may be mocking us, but I would far prefer the reactions, and relative restraint, of those Capitol Hill officers to the kinds of bloodbaths that would surely have occurred under similar circumstances in Russia, China or many other places.<br />There may well be similar failures of intelligence and planning at mass gatherings in the United States in the future. Sometimes it will be understandable, given information available to authorities at the time; sometimes, less so. Now that it has happened, people or groups with truly violent objectives, including mass murder, may see an opportunity to infiltrate themselves within large groups that aren’t necessarily otherwise violent, as jihadists from Syria joined in refugee flows into Europe after Islamic State seized chunks of the Levant. In such situations, police may not be deployed in adequate numbers, establish proper barricades, or be able to call on rapid backup. They need better tools than the police had last week—especially nonlethal weapons to disperse and control unruly crowds or mobs.<br />Today’s nonlethal weapons fall loosely into two categories. One is the group of arms that must be individually targeted—rubber bullets, tasers, beanbag projectiles and the like. These work reasonably well when police aren’t dramatically outnumbered and when particularly dangerous individuals can be identified in a crowd.<br />A second category includes pepper spray, tear gas, wash from low-flying helicopters, water cannons, and other area-effect technologies. These can help in some situations, but they can also cause injury. That is why a Washington Post article June 5, written after the killing of George Floyd, described most nonlethal weapons as “less lethal weapons” in explaining why many cities around the country were reluctant to employ such capabilities during the summer’s protests and riots.</td>

      <td>New variants of the virus will call for adaptations of treatments, which shouldn’t need full studies.</td>
      <td>New variants of the Covid virus appear more infectious, and it’s urgent to get as much protective immunity into the population before these strains can take root. These new variants are evolving in ways that may allow them to slip past diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines. The effort will require a new scientific and regulatory framework that allow countermeasures to be adapted and updated quickly as the threat evolves.<br />The recent variants don’t seem to make Covid infections more severe, but they do make the virus easier to transmit. Some have mutated part of the coronavirus spike protein called the receptor binding domain, which is a target of drugs and vaccines. This genetic evolution was inevitable. The virus has been racing around the world for a year. Countermeasures curtail its spread, but they also enrich the survival prospects of some mutant strains.<br />Two steps would help us stay ahead of these developments. First, engage in real-time monitoring and research. A Covid genomic surveillance system could sample and sequence the virus at a large scale, to identify variants when and where they emerge. There’s a similar system for flu, but not Covid. New investments in experimental science would make possible more insight into how the genetic features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus correlate with its clinical behavior. That can answer the question of whether these evolutionary changes raise new public-health concerns. Next-generation sequencing is widely available in the U.S., but is not being used systematically for public-health surveillance. Most of it is done as part of academic studies that won’t detect strains as they appear.<br />Second, when a new genetic variant is identified and is judged to be a threat, it will be important to have a system for efficiently updating drugs and vaccines.<br />Take the man-made antibody drugs, which latch on to a specific region of the virus and neutralize it, potentially preventing complications if given early in the course of infection. Some of these antibodies target spike proteins that are likely to change. To help prevent threatening variants from emerging, such drugs should be targeted to regions of the virus that don’t change much. When worrisome variants emerge, the antibody drugs can be adapted to go after preserved regions on the new strains. But to keep up with the virus, we will need to evaluate these modified antibodies on their safety and their ability to reduce Covid viral loads, without requiring full outcome studies.</td>

Prices fell in November, due to a pullback in pork prices amid increased supply. China’s producer-price index likely fell 0.8% on year, compared with a 1.5% drop in November, as the price of thermal coal picked up.<br />U.S. consumer prices are expected to increase only moderately in December. Inflation has been mild during much of the pandemic, reflecting weak demand for an array of services and some goods, though some economists expect it to pick up along with faster economic growth later this year.<br />China’s exports are forecast to increase 12.9% from a year earlier in December, a slowdown from November’s 21.1% surge, as another surge of coronavirus cases in Europe and the U.S. puts pressure on external demand for Chinese goods. Meanwhile, December import growth likely accelerated, leading to a largely stable trade surplus of $72 billion.<br />Germany will become the first large economy to release an official estimate of its gross domestic product in 2020, almost certainly recording the first contraction since 2009. The contraction is expected to be of roughly the same magnitude as in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when GDP fell 5%.</td>

The small country—with roughly nine million people, about the same as New York City—now aims to inoculate the majority of its population by March.<br />While Israel’s vaccination campaign is relatively simple compared with the mass mobilizations needed by countries such as the U.S. that have many more people spread over a greater sweep of geography, the effort offers some clear lessons.<br />The  Pfizer Inc. -BioNTech SE vaccine must be administered within five days after it leaves the main storage center and within six hours after a diluent is added before five to six doses are extracted from a vial.<br />To cope with that short shelf life and to reach less-populated and isolated areas, Israel—with Pfizer’s approval—devised a system to split the company’s 1,000-dose packages into smaller batches of a few hundred each. Workers repackage the vials in workstations equipped with massive freezers.<br />Israel, like most other countries, is giving priority to medical professionals, people over 60 and those with high-risk conditions as vaccine recipients. But to make sure no vials are wasted, authorities are also allowing vaccine centers to dole out surplus doses to anyone who shows up.</td>

      <td>Approximately one-third of practicing physicians are over the age of 60 and, increasing, more likely to retire.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Congress’s Doctor Shortage” (Jan. 5): The government’s micromanagement of health care has had many unintended consequences. Spending $900 million to add 1,000 post-graduate medical-education slots seems excessive. That is $900,000 per slot or over three times the four-year tuition costs of medical school. Graduate medical education (GME) has mostly been hospital based while medical care is increasingly provided outside the hospital setting. Restructuring graduate medical education by increasing the focus on community-based care and ambulatory-based surgery to supplement hospital-based care would result in a more cost-effective method for achieving this goal.<br />The second problem of health-care consolidation has been a result of obsolete antitrust laws that encourage health-care consolidation resulting in less competition. As far back as 2010 a report by the attorney general of Massachusetts found up to a 300% difference in costs based on bargaining power and not quality. Consolidation raises prices. We need greater flexibility in our antitrust laws to foster and preserve competition.<br />Physician substitutes including physicians assistants and nurse practitioners can often provide adequate but not equivalent care to board-certified physicians. If these substitutes were in fact equivalent, we should stop spending time and money educating physicians.<br />Approximately one-third of practicing physicians are over the age of 60 and more likely to retire. Covid has accelerated retirements for two reasons: Many older physicians who are at higher risk of dying from Covid have reduced or stopped seeing patients. As physicians age, many continue to enjoy practicing but at a reduced practice load. The further reduction in practice volume, elective procedures and elective surgery since Covid is making these smaller practices unprofitable. Earlier retirement by older physicians will lead to physician shortages sooner than has been previously estimated.<br />Michael T. Goldstein, M.D., J.D.</td>

But alas, they decided to truncate the statistics at 1948, when presumably Major League Baseball was picking off the best players from the Negro Leagues and thus making the league no longer on par with the majors.</td>

      <td>Why ‘participatory democracy’ seems always to degenerate into mob violence.</td>
      <td>On Wednesday afternoon I checked in with a Latin American friend to get his thoughts about the chaos on Capitol Hill. “It looks like home,” he quipped.<br />It was not a unique reflection. By evening a popular observation making the rounds was that the invasion of Congress was the stuff of banana republics. The bedlam also evoked memories of what happened in many U.S. cities over the summer when the Black Lives Matter marches turned violent.<br />There was a big difference between Wednesday and the American summer of terror. During the latter it was merely a presidential candidate (Joe Biden) who refused to condemn the BLM violence—until he realized it was hurting his polls numbers. Last week it was a sitting U.S. president who stirred up the passions of his followers and continued to justify their anger even after it was clear they were breaking the law, endangering lives, damaging property, and attempting to disrupt an independent branch of government. President Trump may have set a new modern-day low.<br />Yet the main worry is that political violence in the U.S. on both the left and the right seems to be on the rise. It won’t recede as long as mob action is tolerated as a way to do politics.<br />A first step in reversing the trend is admitting that the slash-and-burn tactics of both sides are similar. Both justify violence under the banner of “participatory democracy.” Storming the Capitol or burning down a  Starbucks  is the people speaking.</td>

      <td>Inflaming emotions isn’t a crime. The president didn’t mention violence, much less provoke it.</td>
      <td>House Democrats have drafted an article of impeachment that accuses President Trump of “incitement to insurrection.” Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin said Thursday that his office is “looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role” in the Capitol riot. Some reporters have construed that as including Mr. Trump.<br />The president didn’t commit incitement or any other crime. I should know. As a Washington prosecutor I earned the nickname “protester prosecutor” from the antiwar group CodePink. In one trial, I convicted 31 protesters who disrupted congressional traffic by obstructing the Capitol Crypt. In another, I convicted a CodePink activist who smeared her hands with fake blood, charged at then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in a House hearing room, and incited the audience to seize the secretary of state physically. In other cases, I dropped charges when the facts fell short of the legal standard for incitement. One such defendant was the antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan.<br />Hostile journalists and lawmakers have suggested Mr. Trump incited the riot when he told a rally that Republicans need to “fight much harder.” Mr. Trump suggested the crowd walk to the Capitol: “We’re going to cheer on brave senators and congressmen and -women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.”<br />In the District of Columbia, it’s a crime to “intentionally or recklessly act in such a manner to cause another person to be in reasonable fear” and to “incite or provoke violence where there is a likelihood that such violence will ensue.” This language is based on Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), in which the Supreme Court set the standard for speech that could be prosecuted without violating the First Amendment. The justices held that a Ku Klux Klan leader’s calls for violence against blacks and Jews were protected speech. The court found that Clarence Brandenburg’s comments were “mere advocacy” of violence, not “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action . . . likely to incite or produce such action.”<br />The president didn’t mention violence on Wednesday, much less provoke or incite it. He said, “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”</td>

      <td>Little-known procedure allows a president’s party to repeal some rules with a simple majority in House and Senate</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats’ control of the Senate will make it easier for them to reverse parts of outgoing President Trump’s agenda, adding to the Biden administration’s toolbox a little-known congressional procedure to erase executive-branch regulations.<br />Mr. Trump, like his predecessors, ramped up the pace of federal rule-making during his final months in office, in areas from immigration to the environment and financial regulation. The administration put out three to four times its usual volume of rules in recent months, according to estimates by Daniel Pérez, an analyst at George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center.<br />Such measures, known as midnight regulations, are often vulnerable to rollback by an incoming administration of the opposing party.<br />Agency heads appointed by a new president can scrap rules that have been finalized but not yet published in the Federal Register or delay implementation of ones that have been published but haven’t taken effect. And they can decline to defend rules challenged in court.<br />But control of both chambers of Congress by the president’s party unlocks an additional tool. The Congressional Review Act, or CRA, allows the Senate and House of Representatives to overturn regulations finalized by the executive branch in the previous 60 legislative days using a fast-track process that requires a simple majority vote. Most other legislation requires 60 votes to clear the Senate.</td>

      <td>Practicing medicine was satisfying but not thrilling—so Dr. Pooja Goel began selling cosmetics, hair-care and skin-care products online</td>
      <td>When Pooja Goel was growing up in suburban Maryland, there was little question she would become a doctor. “It was just woven into the background,” she said. She was good at math and science, and her parents made no secret of their hope that their oldest daughter would pursue a career in medicine. “My mom’s sisters are all physicians and they all married physicians,” she said. Nobody on her father’s side had become a doctor, “and it was clear how much he valued that I would be the first.” Besides, she had no other career dreams. Instead, she said, “I was like, ‘This is what’s going to work.’ ”<br />In high school, Ms. Goel applied to B.A./M.D. programs, which prepare students to enter medical school right after college. She got into the hybrid program at Lehigh University and Drexel University’s medical school. “It was the ‘no-worry track,’ ” she recalled. There was a hitch, though: In her junior year, Ms. Goel got a C-minus in organic chemistry, which disqualified her from the medical-school portion of her program. When she spoke with the professor who had given her the bad grade, she remembered him saying, “Maybe your path is something different than medicine.”<br />His words only drove her to prove him wrong. She ended up enrolling at Ross University School of Medicine on the Caribbean island of Dominica. (It has since moved to Barbados). She liked the tropical setting and admired her classmates’ drive. “For a lot of them, medicine was their second career,” she said. Her residency at Philadelphia’s Chestnut Hill Hospital also was a positive experience, especially working at a family medicine clinic.<br />Dr. Goel’s first job was at an urgent care clinic in Maryland. She loved the pace of the work and the on-the-spot problem solving. “There was an element of excitement to my days,” she said. But working 14-hour shifts and coming home at 11 o’clock at night was another thing.
