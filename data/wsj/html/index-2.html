      <td>Some people have gone months without fully recovering from the virus—here’s how they’ve tried to manage their illness while doing their jobs</td>
      <td>When Deborah Shaffer tried to return to work two weeks after her Covid-19 infection, she forgot which floor of the veteran’s hospital she worked on. It was one of the many strange expressions of the brain fog that has plagued the social worker in Wichita, Kan., ever since she contracted the virus last November.<br />Ms. Shaffer is a Covid long-hauler, someone who suffers from chronic symptoms for weeks or months after their initial infection. After her failed early attempts to return to the hospital, she hasn’t worked a full day since she got sick, and has no idea if or when she will go back in person.<br />“I’m a trained therapist and clinical social worker, but cannot complete even the most basic tasks before me,” says Ms. Shaffer, 52. She recently started working from home, though she hasn’t yet clocked an eight-hour day.<br />It isn’t easy for Covid long-haulers to return to work. Scientists are just beginning to understand the mysteries of chronic Covid, also called long Covid or post-acute Covid. It can lead to various symptoms after initial infection, including severe fatigue, cognitive issues, digestive problems, erratic heart rates, headaches, dizziness, and fluctuating blood pressure.<br />It’s unclear exactly how many people suffer long-lasting symptoms. But studies suggest it’s a significant portion of the more than 107 million people with confirmed cases around the world. Some 26% of 1,733 Chinese Covid patients discharged from a Wuhan hospital between January and May 2020 still experienced fatigue six months after acute infection, according to a study published in January in the Lancet.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden will participate in a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations on Friday, the White House said, joining a forum for leaders of member countries to discuss plans to defeat the coronavirus pandemic as death counts rise and the global economy remains sluggish.<br />“President Biden will focus on a global response to the Covid pandemic, including coordination on vaccine production, distribution, and supplies, as well as continued efforts to mobilize and cooperate against the threat of emerging infectious diseases by building country capacity and establishing health security financing,” the White House said Sunday.<br />Friday’s meeting will be the first G-7 gathering since April 2020. It will be hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Japan, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and Canada.<br />The White House said Mr. Biden would also focus on the global economic recovery “including the importance of all industrialized countries maintaining economic support for the recovery and collective measures to build back better.…President Biden will also discuss the need to make investments to strengthen our collective competitiveness and the importance of updating global rules to tackle economic challenges such as those posed by China.”<br />Mr. Biden will also raise concerns about climate change, the White House said. The Feb. 19 virtual meeting comes ahead of a planned G-7 summit in June.</td>

      <td>He may run again, but he won’t win another national election.</td>
      <td>The Senate failed Saturday to convict Donald Trump on the single House impeachment article of inciting an insurrection, but the 57-43 vote was no vindication. The statements by Senators who voted to acquit make clear that he escaped conviction mainly—perhaps only—because he is no longer President.<br />Seven Republicans joined every Democrat in the most bipartisan conviction vote in history. While short of the 67 votes needed to convict, most Republicans didn’t defend Mr. Trump’s words or actions on Jan. 6 or his attempts to overturn the election. As we’ve written before, Mr. Trump’s behavior was inexcusable and will mar his legacy for all time.<br />That was the essence of Sen. Mitch McConnell’s post-trial remarks. The GOP leader voted against conviction but explicitly because he said the Constitution reserves the impeachment power only for Presidents while in office. Scholars disagree on this point, and there are good arguments on both sides. Mr. McConnell leaned on the writing of the 19th-century Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story. But he also noted that impeaching a private citizen had no “limiting principle,” and could set a dangerous precedent.<br />This is no mere “technicality,” as Democrats and their media echoes are calling it. Democrats spent days invoking the Constitution in the trial, but suddenly it’s a technicality after the trial. Most Republicans also cited the constitutional claim that Mr. McConnell used to justify acquittal, as did the Senators in 1876 who acquitted the former Secretary of War, William Belknap, after he had resigned in the only other ex-post trial.<br />But Mr. McConnell was lacerating in his criticism of Mr. Trump’s words and actions, which he blamed for deceiving and motivating supporters who had assembled on Jan. 6 at the President’s urging and became a mob. “Former President Trump’s actions that preceded the riot were a disgraceful, disgraceful dereliction of duty,” Mr. McConnell said. “There’s no question—none—that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.”</td>

      <td>Democrats are moving on to cabinet nominees and pandemic relief, which one Republican calls ‘the most radical agenda’</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The end of the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump sets the stage for his successor to pursue his agenda with a Congress no longer encumbered by the wrenching task of accounting for the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />The reality for President Biden, however, is that in pursuing priorities from pandemic relief to measures to address climate change and infrastructure renewal, he will have a difficult time achieving the bipartisanship the Senate showed in the trial that failed to convict Mr. Trump.<br />To the disappointment of congressional Democrats, Mr. Trump on Saturday evening was acquitted on the charge that he incited the Jan. 6 riot because House managers fell short of the 67 Senate votes needed to convict. But seven Republicans—some staunchly conservative on many issues—joined all 50 Democrats in voting to find Mr. Trump guilty of inciting the insurrection, the most bipartisan support for conviction in a presidential impeachment.<br />Republicans, who no longer control the White House or either chamber of Congress, are now divided between those who back Mr. Trump and those who wish he would fade away. For many, the path to recovering power will mean uniting those two factions around a common cause.<br />By the Sunday morning after the impeachment trial, it was clear that one cause will be to rally in opposition to Mr. Biden’s agenda, and the GOP’s most strident voices were already signaling that fight. “My goal is to win in 2022 to stop the most radical agenda I’ve seen coming out of the Democratic presidency of Joe Biden,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) on Fox News.</td>

They say the new agricultural laws remove much-needed government support for poor farmers. The government says the laws will help farmers and consumers by modernizing and streamlining the agricultural supply chain.<br />An environmental activist named Disha Ravi was arrested in the southern city of Bangalore on Saturday.  A local  court decided Sunday that the woman, in her early 20s, could be held for five days in police custody for questioning about her part in the creation and dissemination of the tool kit.<br />A case was filed earlier this month in Delhi against unknown persons in connection with the online document. The complaint said people involved could be guilty of charges including sedition, criminal conspiracy, and creating disharmony among different social, religious and cultural groups, among other things.</td>

      <td>The flamboyant Peronist liberalized the economy and strengthened ties with Washington, but also faced graft probes and planted the seeds of a debt crisis</td>
      <td>Carlos Menem, who led Argentina as president through the 1990s and implemented a free-market liberalization program to stabilize a country chronically plagued by political and economic crises, died Sunday in a Buenos Aires hospital following complications from a urinary infection and heart problems, Argentine media reported, citing his family. He was 90 years old.<br />President Alberto Fernández decreed three days of mourning.<br />Often seen surrounded by models and posing with his red Ferrari, Mr. Menem projected a flamboyant, bon vivant persona that reflected the prosperity he sought during his decadelong rule beginning in 1989. His tenure was marked by the adoption of the Washington Consensus, a package of economic measures promoted by the U.S. and multilateral lenders that included cutbacks in social spending, privatizations of state-run companies and pensions, and pegging the value of the national peso to that of the U.S. dollar.<br />For a time, those actions tamed the hyperinflation and food riots that had weighed on Mr. Menem’s predecessor, allowing Argentines to access credit, splurge on trips to Miami and import German automobiles. But the measures also laid the groundwork for a severe debt crisis that plunged the South American nation into turmoil and opened the door to a series of leftist populist leaders.<br />The phrase “pizza and Champagne” was used to describe the new Argentine society and the nouveau riche that sprouted during Mr. Menem’s time in office, said veteran journalist and television presenter Jorge Lanata. In cultural terms, Mr. Menem’s rule “coincides with the peak of cocaine in Argentina, easy money and superficial success,” Mr. Lanata said, “which we are still paying for.”</td>

      <td>Employees who allege they contracted coronavirus on the job can face a high bar to prove their cases</td>
      <td>Jose Rivero, an attorney in Chicago, has filed more than 30 workers’ compensation claims for people who said they contracted Covid-19 while on the job. In 10 of his cases, including one involving an employee at a meatpacking plant, the workers died.<br />Every claim has been denied. The insurers that denied the claims have said it can’t be proved that the workers were infected on the job. Mr. Rivero said he plans to challenge the denials in court.<br />Determining where a person contracted Covid-19 is proving to be a difficult legal puzzle. In many workers’ compensation cases, carriers said individuals were most likely infected in their off hours, while workers’ attorneys said their clients’ Covid-19 cases were directly linked with unsafe job environments.<br />Insurance carriers and business groups feared at the start of the pandemic that they would be overwhelmed by workers’ comp claims related to Covid-19. That concern intensified as more than a dozen states passed laws giving some employees including nurses and firefighters a presumption of eligibility, or access to workers’ comp coverage without requiring them to prove infections occurred on the job.<br />Those fears turned out to be unfounded. Workers filed hundreds of thousands of virus-related claims in 2020, but those cases, according to state and industry data, were more than offset by a steep drop in non-Covid-19 claims as layoffs, shutdowns and remote work reduced the number of workplace accidents and injuries.</td>

But it’s also directed national Olympic committees to try to get shots for their athletes.<br />The conflicting signals show what a touchy topic the vaccine has become ahead of Tokyo. Even discussing shots for athletes can provoke hostility as a slow vaccine rollout proceeds around the world among countries eager to turn the tide of deaths, case numbers and economic downturn. Yet sports officials in dominant Olympic nations say they’re pursuing the IOC’s request anyway.<br />Meanwhile, a longtime IOC member asserted in strong terms the importance of vaccines to the countries participating in the Tokyo Games, now just five months away.<br />“Unless you’re out of your f—ing mind, you should get vaccinated before you come,” said Dick Pound, in a recent interview with the Journal.</td>

A widespread return isn’t expected to begin until the late spring or early summer, according to business leaders and recent worker surveys. But the slow return could signal that a significant increase in employees returning to work will lag behind progress made on containing the pandemic.<br />Office employees started to head back to work through the summer and early fall in some parts of the country as lockdowns eased and the spread of Covid-19 slowed. An average of more than 27% of workforces were back at their desks by mid-October in the 10 large U.S. cities tracked by Kastle Systems, a security company that monitors access-card swipes in more than 2,500 office buildings.<br />That rate in those 10 cities was down to 23.8% of workers the first week of February, slightly down from the 24.2% the previous week, Kastle said.<br />The same barriers that have kept most people at home for nearly a year remain. Employers are hesitant to ask workers to come back because they can’t assure them they won’t get sick from returning.</td>

Apple also said about half the customers who purchased iPads were new to the tablets.<br />With so many fresh iPads out in the wild, I decided to revisit one of my favorite topics: Can an iPad actually replace your computer?<br />I know, I’ve referred to the iPad as a spork. It tries to do two jobs—be as mobile as a phone and as powerful as a computer—and in doing so, it makes compromises. But I’m realizing its versatility outweighs the compromises. Proof? Lately, I’ve found myself reaching for my iPad far more often than my MacBook. Here’s why:<br />• The iPad is faster. It takes far less time to boot up and load apps than my Intel-powered MacBook Pro. When I get a phone call, I can fire up the iPad and immediately start taking notes with a keyboard or the Apple Pencil. And there’s no spinning Beach Ball of Doom when there are too many browser tabs open.<br />• The iPad is more flexible. If I want to read a Kindle book or binge on a  Netflix  show, I can easily disengage the keyboard and curl up with the device on the couch.</td>

      <td>Working across the aisle is a key part of his appeal to swing voters—and Mitch McConnell knows it.</td>
      <td>When you work in the White House, you reserve only the toughest of tough decisions for the president. If the best option is clear or obvious, the staff signs off before it reaches the Oval Office. As President Biden wrestles with a pandemic, a stalling economy and the GOP’s recalcitrant leadership, every potential move comes with serious trade-offs. Like every president, Mr. Biden’s success will be determined by how deftly he balances policy and politics as well as his short- and long-term objectives.<br />Mr. Biden’s legacy will be defined largely by how well he handles Covid-19 and whether he can rev up the economy. His pledge to unify the country distinguished him as a candidate. Because many voters view bipartisanship as a core part of his character, abandoning it risks undermining his central appeal to swing voters and others. Keenly aware of the president’s situation, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is looking to force him into a no-win choice between a short-term legislative success and long-term bipartisanship. Mr. Biden’s challenge is to avoid Mr. McConnell’s trap—to pursue the robust pandemic relief package the country needs without destroying his relationships with moderate Republicans who will be crucial to passing his plan to “build back better.”<br />Mr. McConnell is playing the long game as always. He knows that Mr. Biden won’t scale back the funding required to get the country past this long, dark winter. As minority leader, he can’t stop Democrats from using the tools provided through the budget reconciliation process; he used the same strategy when championing tax cuts in 2017. He wants to make Mr. Biden’s coming legislative victory as costly as it can be politically, framing it to the public as evidence that the president’s professed devotion to bipartisanship was merely lip service. If senators come to believe that the president is stiff-arming Republicans, Mr. McConnell will more easily convince his GOP colleagues to join him in obstructing the rest of the president’s agenda.<br />This is not only an economic debate; it’s a political balancing act. The near-term risk of sliding into a double-dip recession is much more dangerous than the possibility that inflation may return this summer. If the nation slips into another recession, the president will quickly lose his political capital. In other words, the country can’t afford for Mr. Biden to abandon today for tomorrow, and Mr. McConnell is using that reality as leverage. As President Clinton’s tenure made clear, tough, single-party economic fixes passed at an administration’s outset can open the door to bipartisan successes down the line.<br />That said, Mr. Biden can’t ignore the political risk of steamrolling the GOP. A majority of Americans (especially independents) want him to follow through on his promise to work across the aisle. If “build back better” is the north star for this administration, Mr. Biden will need Republicans who vote against the relief package to work with him on climate, infrastructure, education and more.</td>

That means being in fresh air, under trees and away from cars and concrete—on a regular basis. And, no, the Peloton doesn’t count.<br />“There’s an urgent need emerging in science and at the gut level to increase the nature experience. This field is just exploding,” says Gretchen Daily, a professor of environmental science at Stanford University.<br />The benefits have been clear to scientists for some time, but the pandemic has made the matter more urgent. The physical and emotional toll the virus has taken, especially in urban areas with little green space, has galvanized doctors, researchers and others to tap into nature’s therapeutic effects.<br />Spending time in the woods—a practice the Japanese call “forest bathing”—is strongly linked to lower blood pressure, heart rate and stress hormones and decreased anxiety, depression and fatigue.</td>

They came into the Covid-19 crisis still digesting a mountain of bad loans from the sovereign-debt crisis that started more than a decade ago.<br />The pandemic injected urgency into the situation. The European Central Bank has leaned on banks to reform and has paved the way for cost-saving mergers. National governments, long resistant to approving bank mergers that would result in job cuts, have changed their tune. Dreary stock-market valuations have spurred CEOs to act.<br />“The pandemic, to some extent, has been a catalyst for banks to bite the bullet and start addressing these weaknesses in a more radical way,” Andrea Enria, head of banking supervision at the ECB, said recently.</td>

      <td>Early signs point to an uptick in consumer spending at the start of the year, particularly by lower- and middle-income households receiving payments through the most recent Covid-19 relief package.<br />Spending by consumers who make less than $60,000 a year jumped by more than 20% in the week ended Jan. 10—the week after the U.S. Treasury Department began electronically sending stimulus payments of $600 per adult and $600 per child for individuals with adjusted gross incomes under $75,000—according to the research group Opportunity Insights’ tracker of figures from Affinity Solutions, which collects consumer credit- and debit-card spending data.<br />Spending by households making above $100,000 by contrast, was broadly flat compared with January 2020 that week.<br />Among households receiving stimulus payments, 88% spent their $600 check “like it burned a hole through their pocket,” said Jonathan Silver, chief executive of Affinity Solutions. That jump in spending shows there is “significant pent-up demand for necessities” while higher-income groups “pulled back the reins” on spending, he said.<br />Other data suggest an improving outlook for consumer spending. Weekly claims for unemployment benefits fell the week ended Feb. 6 to a level well below an early January peak, a sign layoffs are easing. Employers resumed hiring in January, when the unemployment rate declined to 6.3% from 6.7%. Newly reported cases of Covid-19 are down sharply from peak levels reached last month, according to Johns Hopkins data.</td>

She was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump last month on the allegation that he incited the violence at the U.S. Capitol.<br />Then on Friday night, she released a statement detailing a conversation on Jan. 6 between Mr. Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) that she said Mr. McCarthy had relayed to her, helping inform her vote.<br />After an extensive back and forth over whether to call witnesses on Saturday, the House managers and the former president’s counsel agreed to have Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the lead impeachment manager, read Ms. Herrera Beutler’s statement explaining how Mr. McCarthy’s recollection of his call with then-President Trump on Jan. 6 prompted her to vote to impeach Mr. Trump. Mr. Raskin then entered the statement into evidence.<br />In the call, Mr. Trump initially claimed the protesters were linked to antifa, Ms. Herrera Beutler said in her statement, referring to the loose network of antiracist, antifascist protesters.</td>

The suit also alleges David Calhoun, then the lead-director who later became CEO, exaggerated to journalists the degree to which directors attended to safety concerns between and in the wake of the two crashes.<br />The suit alleges that Mr. Calhoun, who became CEO in early 2020, conducted a public-relations campaign that “insisted the board acted with more urgency and was more engaged than it actually had been” following the two crashes that killed 346 people in October 2018 and March 2019.

      <td>In an age of political division, plays like ‘Othello’ and ‘The Merchant of Venice’ offer lessons in understanding difference</td>
      <td>The anger and unwillingness of many Americans to listen to those with different opinions is a serious societal problem. But the solution to this toxic state of things must begin on the level of the individual, with the way we listen and speak to relatives, neighbors and colleagues whose views may be diametrically opposed to our own. Lessons for modeling this kind of empathy can be found in literature—above all, in Shakespeare, whose plays are a great antidote to extremism and mean-spiritedness.<br />The renowned literary critic Harold Bloom asserted that Shakespeare “invented the human,” reflected in the rich interior lives of his characters. But it’s not just that Shakespeare’s characters are recognizably human; it is that the plays are constructed to make us more human. They elicit empathy for people whose backgrounds, situations and bodies are different from our own—characters we might otherwise dismiss, dislike or even abhor.<br />“The Merchant of Venice,” written in the late 1590s, was Shakespeare’s breakthrough play in this regard. The plot is principally taken from a 14th-century Italian tale, “Il Pecorone” (“The Simpleton”), about a young merchant who borrows money from a Jewish moneylender and offers a pound of his own flesh as security. But in that story the moneylender is an uninflected villain, while Shylock, the equivalent character in Shakespeare’s play, is given psychological depth and pathos. “Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?” Shylock demands with poignant insistence. He explains that he has been made a villain by the Christian society that mistreats him: “The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.”<br />In “Othello,” Shakespeare extends the same idea into a new context. Othello is a Moorish general in the Venetian army who wins the love of a Venetian noblewoman, Desdemona, with his martial exploits. But Iago, a junior officer, preys on Othello’s insecurity as a Black man in a white society, insinuating that Desdemona’s decision to marry him is “unnatural” in light of her “clime, complexion, and degree.”<br />What is often missed in this play is how much the scheming, villainous Iago is also a target of prejudice. The English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge famously referred to Iago as being driven by “motiveless malignity,” but Shakespeare offers clues that the character’s malevolence is generated by a deep sense of grievance. Iago, a coarse, lower-class soldier, never has a speech like Shylock’s “Hath not a Jew eyes,” but he explains bitterly in the play’s first scene that he is deeply resentful at having been unfairly passed over for promotion: “’Tis the curse of service,/ Preferment goes by letter and affection, /And not by old gradation.” The man promoted in his place is the inexperienced but more refined Cassio, whom Iago convinces Othello is having an affair with Desdemona.</td>

      <td>Our favorite Valentine’s Day flower was already a symbol of passion in ancient Greek mythology</td>
      <td>Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today’s world. Read previous columns here.<br />“My luve is like a red red rose,/That’s newly sprung in June,” wrote the Scottish poet Robert Burns in 1794, creating an inexhaustible revenue stream for florists everywhere, especially around Valentine’s Day. But why a red rose, you might well ask.<br />Longevity is one reason. The rose is an ancient and well-traveled flower: A 55 million-year-old rose fossil found in Colorado suggests that roses were already blooming when our earliest primate ancestors began populating the earth. If you want to see where it all began, at least in the New World, then a trip to the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument, roughly two hours’ drive from Denver, should be on your list of things to do once the pandemic is over.<br />In Greek mythology the rose was associated with Aphrodite, goddess of love, who was said to have emerged from the sea in a shower of foam that transformed into white roses. Her son Cupid bribed Harpocrates, the god of silence, with a single rose in return for not revealing his mother’s love affairs, giving rise to the Latin phrase sub rosa, “under the rose,” as a term for secrecy. As for the red rose, it was said to be born of tragedy: Aphrodite became tangled in a rose bush when she ran to comfort her lover Adonis as he lay dying from a wild boar attack. Scratched and torn by its thorns, her feet bled onto the roses and turned them crimson.<br />For the ancient Romans, the rose’s symbolic connection to love and death made it useful for celebrations and funerals alike. A Roman banquet without a suffocating cascade of petals was no banquet at all, and roses were regularly woven into garlands or crushed for their perfume. The first time Mark Antony saw Cleopatra he had to wade through a carpet of rose petals to reach her, by which point he had completely lost his head.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers have sweeping plans to change the foundational covenant between the government and internet platforms. Some experts are cheering, others are wondering if they’ll be burning down the internet rather than saving it.</td>
      <td>Change is likely coming for Section 230, the law that protects online platforms from being held liable for things users say on them. As one of his last acts as president, Donald Trump attempted to strike down the law. President Biden has also said it should be revoked.<br />More than 20 proposals to update Section 230 have surfaced on the Hill, originating from both sides of the aisle. Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and John Thune (R-S.D.), plan to reintroduce one of them, the PACT Act, in the coming weeks, says Sen. Thune. A competing bill was recently proposed by a trio of Democratic U.S. senators on Feb. 5. Its intention, as its backers wrote, is to make social-media companies “accountable for enabling cyberstalking, targeted harassment and discrimination.”<br />There is broad agreement among experts and politicians that Section 230 won’t be eliminated, but that’s where accord ends. While many believe an update of the law is necessary and imminent, many others think most attempts to alter it are dangerous. And despite a flurry of ideas for modernizing the law, it’s not clear where it falls in Congress’s priorities in light of all the other challenges facing the country.<br />The heads of some Big Tech companies, notably  Facebook ’s  Mark Zuckerberg (in October) and  Microsoft ’s  Satya Nadella (on Wednesday) have said they welcome more clarity on what sort of speech should be allowed under Section 230. Meanwhile, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey on Tuesday proposed a more “market-driven” approach to addressing the desire to update Section 230. Even if legislation is passed, it’s not clear exactly what sort of cases will be brought to test the updated law, or what precedents those decisions will establish. And hashing it out in the courts could take years.<br />“Section 230 touches on everything from election integrity to online social-media bias,” says Klon Kitchen, who was until recently director of the Center for Technology Policy at the politically conservative Heritage Foundation. If we try to solve all the problems of the internet by making changes to this one law, he adds, we’ll be overwhelmed by their unintended consequences.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration issued a formal statement criticizing China over refusing to provide World Health Organization pandemic investigators with data on early Covid-19 cases that could help explain how the virus spread.<br />“We have deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the Covid-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement issued on Saturday. “It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government.”<br />“To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak,” Mr. Sullivan said.<br />The WHO investigators are part of a team that this past week completed a monthlong mission in China aimed at determining the origins of the pandemic. Chinese authorities refused requests to provide raw data on 174 cases of Covid-19 that they have identified from the early phase of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.<br />The Chinese provided their own analysis of data and information, saying that they had found no evidence of the virus. But the WHO team wasn’t allowed to view the raw underlying data on those studies, which could allow them to conduct independent analysis on how early and how extensively the virus began to spread in China, team members told The Wall Street Journal, describing heated conversations.</td>

The agreement is essentially three separate one-year deals, giving Bauer the option to return to the free-agent market after each season. It calls for him averaging $42.5 million in compensation in 2021 and 2022, far surpassing any of his peers.<br />It’s after that when things get really interesting.

      <td>President Biden marked the early weeks of his presidency with his broad use of executive action, but he has another go-to move: the task force.<br />The Biden administration has established about two dozen new interagency working groups, advisory councils, task forces, committees and offices, which are charged with producing more than 80 reports, proposals for future policy, plans and reviews of current policies, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of more than 40 executive actions made public.<br />That’s more groups created via presidential decree than his most-recent predecessors had at this point in their administrations. Former President Donald Trump, who often relied on a cadre of informal advisers to inform his decisions, had created one new task force and one new office by the same point in his administration, and former President Barack Obama had set up five new panels.<br />Mr. Biden’s aides and backers say the proliferation of panels—including two unveiled this week to coordinate government efforts on carbon-reduction technologies and to review the national-security aspects of the administration’s China strategy—demonstrates a deliberative approach to governing that seeks to incorporate expert input.<br />“This is how a normal administration operates,” said Chris Lu, who managed Mr. Obama’s first-term cabinet. “It brings together experts from inside and outside the government to provide the best advice in order to solve big problems.”</td>

They all have their cameras on. When Ms. Anderson’s fourth-grade daughter received her report card recently, there was a note from the teacher saying she seems distracted during class.<br />“I’m getting chastised for a distracted environment?” said Ms. Anderson, of Eugene, Ore., who teaches college students online. “I’m not going to have my young children alone in their rooms doing their work. There is no winning solution.”<br />Districts were hesitant to make cameras a requirement in the fall, out of respect for family privacy. Besides increasing anxiety for some kids, the live look into students’ living quarters—not only by teachers, but also by fellow students—might pose equity issues.<br />As students enter the midway slump of a trying school year, after months of full or partial remote learning, more districts around the country are requiring students to turn on their cameras. While educators have seen positive results in grades and participation, the debate continues.</td>

Mr. Biden’s campaign website said he would make a priority of passing a law against domestic terrorism “that respects free speech and civil liberties,” though it is unclear if that would entail creating a broad statute. The Biden administration has yet to make any recommendations and is considering civil-rights concerns, a senior administration official said earlier in February.<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation can robustly monitor international terrorists with the goal of disrupting plots before they occur. But there are legal constraints on what the bureau can do at home.</td>

But the firms’ nondisclosure of the agreement with the members of the Sackler family who own Purdue, and whose interests are at odds with company creditors, skirted bankruptcy rules meant to reveal potential conflicts of interest, bankruptcy experts said.<br />Earlier this week, Michael Quinn, a lawyer representing five people with wrongful death and personal injury claims against Purdue, questioned whether the 2018 defense agreement restricted what Skadden and WilmerHale could disclose to creditors as they have probed whether they can recover billions of dollars from the drugmaker’s owners. Even though the law firms have represented Purdue for years, they have additional obligations to company creditors while the company is in chapter 11.<br />A separate committee of Purdue creditors has been probing the transfer of billions of dollars from Purdue to the Sacklers before the company filed bankruptcy, according to court documents. The committee is examining if these roughly $10 billion in transfers to the Sacklers can be recovered for the benefit of Purdue creditors, court papers say. Mr. Quinn said in his letter he is concerned that the obligation in the defense agreement to keep Sackler information confidential conflicted with Skadden’s and WilmerHale’s duties in bankruptcy to Purdue and its creditors.<br />The Sacklers have consistently denied throughout the bankruptcy case that the transfers were improper and said more than half the money was used to pay taxes or invested in international ventures. However, they offered to cede control of Purdue and pay a $3 billion cash settlement to resolve creditor claims against them.</td>

      <td>The tech-bro uniform is on its way out. Here’s how a new generation of women in tech is changing the status quo, starting with what they wear.</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a thrice-monthly column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />EVERYONE KNOWS what the male tech-bro uniform is. Lowly software engineers and island-buying titans alike favor jeans, sweatshirts and sneakers in faded shades of  Twitter -blue and Windows-gray. Casualness is a club for men in Silicon Valley, and dressing down is the secret handshake. In “Uncanny Valley,” Anna Wiener’s 2020 memoir of 2010s San Francisco startup life, she wrote, “Bars were overrun with men in their twenties wearing corporate-branded T-shirts...Men who wore stability running shoes to nightclubs.”<br />For women—who still fill fewer than 25% of technical roles at the leading tech companies as reported by Statista—navigating fashion is a minefield. Vinthujah Balasubramaniam, a 29-year-old founder of a start-up in Montreal and product manager at a tech company, said that the latter’s CEO dresses in a hoodie and shorts, and what is emphasized is “the value that you deliver as a person.” As a result of this culture, she said, her “idea of what a professional outfit is has changed.”<br />Historically, women navigating a career in tech cope by gravitating toward one of two extremes. Some do their best to blend in with the male engineers in cotton sweatshirts, drab slim pants and washable sneaker-ish Rothy’s flats. Meanwhile women in financing, sales and leadership positions often adopt full Ted-Talk looks, assembling outfits from brightly colored designer pieces. During Marissa Mayer’s stint as Yahoo’s CEO, a Vogue writer called her “an unusually stylish geek” in a 2013 article. The HBO show “Silicon Valley” satirized the binary choice these two tracks represent: female-engineer characters lurked in the background in slouching jeans, while the show’s VC execs wore sleek power dresses.<br />But, beyond just fitting in, what about personal taste or expression? Today, a small but significant subsection of women in tech is challenging the status quo of the industry’s dress codes. They’re wearing tops with exaggerated proportions, androgynous pantsuits in sorbet shades, and unapologetically large earrings. This rebellion might reflect geographical splintering: Covid has all but erased those mythological Bay Area campuses where worker bees gathered hoodie-to-hoodie to eat kale in the sunshine. Or perhaps it’s due to the strengthening of social networks on TikTok and Instagram, where women in tech connect via Instagram and Tiktok handles and hashtags like “womenintech” and “stemschicks.”</td>

Shortages have been even worse in non-EU countries in Europe.<br />So far, it is mainly small nations on the bloc’s margins that have turned to Beijing for help. Yet as voters’ frustrations mount, larger members are now considering China’s two vaccines and another developed in Russia.<br />On Jan. 31, German Health Minister Jens Spahn called on the EU to approve the shot made by China’s  Sinopharm Group  if it were found to be safe and effective.

      <td>The early modernist style, evocative of the natural world, can be seen in abundance in whimsical buildings along the Danube and elsewhere in Europe.</td>
      <td>There’s hardly a more rewarding aspect of travel than strolling a new locale, like a modern-day flâneur. The experience is especially sweet when you see something unexpectedly stunning, as I did some years ago in Riga, Latvia. I knew about its Art Nouveau district, yet when I came upon Albert Street, lined with pastel-hued buildings festooned with faces, figures, peacocks, flowers and other Art Nouveau motifs, I was stopped in my tracks by their beauty.<br />Paris, Brussels and Barcelona are famous for their elegant, undulating Art Nouveau architectural treasures, but this style, which thrived from about 1890 to 1910, is prominent throughout Europe, in big cities and small towns alike. Many can be explored online—starting with Riga, which claims to have the largest concentration of Art Nouveau buildings in the world.<br />The Riga Art Nouveau Museum is particularly memorable. Once the home of architect Konstantīns Pēkšēns, it has a graceful façade decorated with plant and animal designs. The interior, including its spiral staircase—a delightful match of swirling and geometric patterns on the banister and the walls along the way—has been restored, room by room, to its glory days in the early 20th century, viewable in a photo gallery on the website. History tells us why that was needed: These beautiful rooms were requisitioned for communal housing during the Soviet occupation, each one assigned to a separate family.<br />To see other Art Nouveau edifices, you might start with a 55-minute documentary on YouTube called “Art Nouveau Without Borders.” Partly funded by the European Union, this video focuses on cities in the Danube River basin, making stops from Vienna to Oradea, Romania. Well-narrated, the film briefly relates how Art Nouveau, which celebrates natural forms, originated in reaction and opposition to the stilted academic style of the 19th century. It also tells viewers the monikers used for the style in different countries, such as Jugendstil in Germany, Secession in Austria and Arte Joven in Spain; provides the names of leading architects; and showcases very impressive buildings, pausing at times for interviews with art historians.<br />The video visits well-known examples of Art Nouveau, particularly in Vienna. There’s the white-cube Secession building, topped by a brilliant gold dome of laurel leaves, and the gorgeous Church of St. Leopold, whose white and gold interior is crowned by a mosaic depicting the ascension of souls into heaven.</td>

Along with arms sales and the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, it includes an assessment of whether the U.S. has done enough to hold Saudi officials accountable for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and other aspects of the two countries’ ties, U.S. officials said.<br />During his campaign, Mr. Biden called Saudi Arabia a “pariah.” Since then, the new administration has struck a different tone, stressing the U.S. will help defend the kingdom against attacks from Iranian-backed forces in the region, even while calling for an end to the civil war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia intervened in 2015.<br />While relations have frayed over the past decade, Washington and Riyadh still need each other on multiple fronts, from grappling with Iran to coordinating counterterrorism and energy policies, the current and former officials said.<br />“It’s pretty hard to envision any kind of a strategy in the region that can work if the Saudis aren’t some part of it,” said Dennis Ross, who served in key Mideast roles under Republican and Democratic presidents.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats and Donald Trump’s defense team are preparing for closing arguments Saturday on charges that he incited last month’s riot at the Capitol, in what are expected to be abbreviated remarks before a final vote on whether to convict the former president.<br />The Democrats, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, and Mr. Trump’s lawyers will each have two hours to wrap up their cases. The defense team said it plans to use only half its time.<br />Many Republican and Democratic senators sitting as jurors have said they have largely made up their minds, essentially ensuring Mr. Trump’s acquittal in his second impeachment trial and the fourth presidential impeachment trial in American history. In a vote Tuesday on the constitutionality of trying a former president on impeachment charges, only six Republicans sided with the chamber’s 50 Democrats. It would take 67 votes to convict Mr. Trump.<br />With the outcome not in doubt, the question will be how many Republicans join Democrats in voting to convict. Much of the focus was on Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), who on Friday was photographed studying notes that said “the House managers did not connect the dots” between Mr. Trump’s Jan. 6 speech and his supporters’ attack on the Capitol, resulting in the deaths of five people including a Capitol Police officer. Mr. Cassidy later said that was one of two news releases his staff had prepared—one for each position—and that he still hasn’t made up his mind.<br />Also at issue was whether either side would attempt to subpoena witnesses or enter new evidence. Senators of both parties have said they didn’t need to hear from witnesses, which would require lengthy depositions, prolonging a trial that both Republicans and Democrats have said they want to wrap up.</td>

That progress—highlighted in cockpits managed primarily by computers, totally autonomous helicopters and automated aerial-refueling tankers—is likely to show up in future civilian aircraft, advanced air-traffic-control systems and a range of drone applications.<br />Skeptics worry automated systems sometimes reflect software developers’ desire to incorporate new capabilities without full testing. They point to examples of high-profile stumbles ranging from glitch-prone radio communication systems to software problems that have deprived pilots of adequate oxygen at the controls of jet fighters.<br />Unlike commercial automation, “there aren’t any regulators or outsiders to scrutinize Pentagon efforts,” said Najmedin Meshkati, a human-factors expert who teaches at the University of Southern California. “You really have to do your homework before integrating emerging new applications with older technology.”<br />But already, programs meant to supplement and eventually replace human operators are accelerating in every branch of the U.S. armed services.</td>

Together, the roughly 300 civil liberties lawsuits related to Covid-19 represent the most significant test in more than a century of the emergency powers of state governors and the scope of liberty in dire times.<br />A review of rulings on emergency measures shows that federal and state courts have been reluctant to second-guess governors, upholding widespread restrictions on travel, gatherings and commerce. On the federal bench, judges appointed by Republican presidents were less deferential, but overall, the courts have given more weight to the government’s interest in controlling disease than to the rights of individuals and business owners.<br />When judges did push back against state orders, their sharpest scrutiny was reserved for restrictions on religious worship and abortion access.</td>

      <td>Key moments and themes as Trump’s lawyers mounted their defense</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The fourth day of the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump offered a chance for his lawyers to dispute Democrats’ charge that Mr. Trump was responsible for the riot that took place on Jan. 6. Then senators were permitted to ask both sides follow-up questions. Here are eight takeaways from Friday:<br />Mr. Trump’s defense team called Democrats’ allegations that he incited the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot “patently absurd.” “No thinking person could seriously believe that the president’s Jan. 6 speech on the Ellipse was in any way an incitement to violence or insurrection,” Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen said. He called the impeachment trial another part of a “witch hunt” by Democrats.<br />The defense team aired several montages of quick-cut footage of Democratic lawmakers using the word “fight,” arguing that Mr. Trump’s use of the word on Jan. 6 wasn’t unusual and is standard political fare. The video also included now-President Biden saying if he were in high school he would take Mr. Trump “behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.” Other clips the defense used were on the milder side, including a clip of Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia vowing to keep up the fight in a speech about mine workers’ health and retirement benefits. “Spare us the hypocrisy and false indignation,” said Mr. van der Veen. Democrats said the presentation made a false equivalence.<br />One of the defense team’s lawyers, Bruce L. Castor Jr., said Mr. Trump’s supporters couldn’t have taken his speech on Jan. 6 as a call for political violence because he was only urging members of Congress to fight to keep him in power—or else face primary challenges for re-election. “Listening to it as you have here, unedited by us, is it possible that President Trump’s disdain for political violence could be any clearer to the persons listening as he was speaking? Is it possible that his words could have been misunderstood?” Mr. Castor said. “I suggest to you that is impossible.”<br />Another of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, David Schoen, accused House Democrats of manipulating evidence and showing selectively edited videos and images during their presentation. A senior aide to the Democratic impeachment managers said that they had to re-create a tweet—because Mr. Trump’s  Twitter  account had been taken down—and there was an extraneous check mark but the text was the same. The Democrats said the defense’s accusation about selective video editing was false and accused Mr. Trump’s team of the same thing.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Bill Cassidy emerged this week as a wild card in the trial over whether former President Donald Trump incited the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and he said Friday he still hasn’t made up his mind.<br />The Louisiana Republican surprised colleagues Tuesday when he voted with Democrats to assert the constitutionality of the trial and move ahead with the proceedings. Headed into the final days of the case, he has walked a fine line. He said that he has found the Democrats’ arguments compelling and had questions for Mr. Trump’s lawyers. But he also has insisted that his recent action didn’t indicate whether he would vote to convict Mr. Trump.<br />“The American people are counting on us actually coming to this with a mind ready to receive information,” Mr. Cassidy said. “And, yes there’s people on both sides of it who want your mind made up right now. But there’s a lot at stake here.”<br />Mr. Cassidy didn’t state his position Friday. He was photographed reviewing notes of a document that appeared to point toward acquittal, but later said it was one of two press releases his staff had prepared for each position. “If I had flipped the page, you would have had the one going the other way,” he said.<br />The notes he held read: “the House managers did not connect the dots to show President Trump knew that the attack on the Capitol was going to be violent and result in the loss of life.”</td>

      <td>Four pharmaceutical companies in settlement talks with states to resolve claims related to their involvement in the national opioid crisis stand to reap about $1 billion each in tax breaks if a combined payout of more than $26 billion is finalized, according to company filings.<br />The drug distributors  McKesson Corp. ,  AmerisourceBergen Corp.  and  Cardinal Health Inc.,  along with  Johnson & Johnson ,  plan to deduct the payouts from their taxes, filings show.<br />Cardinal, which expects to pay $6.6 billion as part of the settlement, said in a regulatory filing earlier this month that it anticipates receiving a $943 million tax benefit as a result of losses it incurred because of the payout charge. The company said it has filed for an income tax refund it expects to receive in the next 12 months.<br />Cardinal, based in Dublin, Ohio, said $420 million of the benefit would come from offsetting profits from prior tax years when there was a higher corporate income-tax rate, taking advantage of a provision created by Congress as part of its Covid-19 economic-relief package last March<br />“We recorded a net operating loss for tax purposes in our second quarter, which, as permissible under current federal law, will be carried back to recover previously paid federal taxes,” a Cardinal spokeswoman said in an email.</td>

The boat could capsize. She could be beaten, starved or extorted by human traffickers. She could die. Or, like the 10 previous attempts she had made to get across, her escape could be thwarted by rough seas or border authorities. Still, to Sadeka, a 21-year-old Rohingya refugee from Myanmar, making the journey seemed like the only way for a fresh start.<br />It was either that or languish behind barbed wire, potentially for the rest of her life, in the world’s largest refugee camp, her immediate family scattered across three countries.<br />Sadeka’s story is the Rohingya’s in microcosm. Driven to the brink of destruction by rampaging soldiers, human traffickers and hostile governments, a community that was once believed to have numbered well over a million in Myanmar has been sundered, not by a single action, but by a series of blows that have left a people with no place to call home.</td>

      <td>TORONTO—A Canadian court ruled Friday that victims of a 2018 shooting in Toronto have a viable legal claim of negligence against gun maker  Smith & Wesson Corp.  for failing provide safeguards on the gun used by the shooter.<br />Judge Paul Perell of the Superior Court of Ontario said in the ruling that a stolen Smith & Wesson handgun used by the shooter didn’t include available smart gun technology that restricts use to authorized individuals. Such a lapse, he said, is sufficient grounds for the families to proceed with their class action.<br />Canadian law requires judges to certify that class actions have a reasonable chance of success before they can proceed. The ruling clears the way for the case to continue.<br />“The immediate case may demonstrate that there came a time when it was careless for Smith & Wesson not to utilize invented authorized user technology, of which there were many types, some of which Smith & Wesson invented and patented,” Judge Perell said in his decision.<br />Smith & Wesson argued the case could have “industry shattering consequences” if a class action judge finds the company failed its legal duty to provide safeguards on the gun, the decision said. Malcolm Ruby, a lawyer for the victims said it could be a few years before a trial begins.</td>

The Biden administration shelved a plan to force a sale of the popular video-sharing app’s American operations to a group including Oracle and  Walmart Inc.  The deal was driven by former President Donald Trump, who last year ordered a ban on TikTok aimed at forcing a sale of the app to a majority-U.S.-ownership group.

      <td>Does unrestrained federal spending have any economic cost? Can federal debt keep climbing to be larger than the entire U.S. economy without consequence? Sooner or later Americans are going to find out, as Congress and the Biden Administration use the pandemic to justify an unprecedented peacetime spending binge.<br />For the magnitudes involved, the best recent overview arrived this week in the annual Congressional Budget Office’s 10-year budget forecast. It deserves more attention than it’s receiving because Americans will be paying for it for decades.<br />CBO says federal spending reached $6.55 trillion in fiscal 2020, as Congress addressed the damage from Covid-19 and the government shutdowns. That’s about a $2.1 trillion increase in a single year, and understandably so given the uncertainty of the threat as it emerged in the spring. Notably, and in a pleasant surprise, revenue fell a mere 1.2% to $3.42 trillion as the economy held up better than expected. The deficit came in at a staggering $3.13 trillion, or a record 14.9% of GDP.<br />What about the future? CBO says not to expect much fiscal improvement this year, with spending still at 26.3% of GDP. The deficit will be $2.26 trillion or 10.3% of GDP. For comparison, the deficit during Barack Obama’s entire first term was $5.1 trillion, and the deficit as a share of GDP hasn’t been that high since 1945. Even at the height of the 1983 recession, it reached only 5.9%.<br />CBO projects spending to average 21.9% of GDP over the next decade under current law, but that doesn’t include Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid bill and other plans. Democrats are already promising another trillion-dollar “green” public works bill later this year. Investors must be expecting a subsidy blowout judging by the fantastic market valuations of electric car and renewable energy companies.</td>

      <td>His adviser admits to covering up New York’s nursing home deaths.</td>
      <td>Three months ago New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was awarded an Emmy for “his leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and his masterful use of TV to inform and calm people around the world.” Turns out the Emmys had the right actor—but the wrong performance. Increasingly it looks like Mr. Cuomo’s real act was to keep people from finding out how many people in his state’s nursing homes died from Covid-19.<br />On Thursday the New York Post reported that Melissa DeRosa, the Governor’s top aide, admitted to Democratic leaders that the state had deliberately kept the true numbers from them. In a Wednesday conference call, Ms. DeRosa told Democrats the Cuomo administration rejected a legislative request for the figures last August because Donald Trump was tweeting that “we killed everyone in nursing homes” and was directing “the Department of Justice to do an investigation into us.”<br />As Ms. DeRosa put it, “Basically, we froze.” The administration wasn’t sure, she said, if any information it released to state lawmakers or the Department of Justice “was going to be used against us” or “if there was going to be an investigation.”<br />Nursing home deaths are a sensitive issue for Mr. Cuomo because of a March 25 health department directive that barred these homes from rejecting people because they had Covid-19. The Associated Press reports that 9,056 recovering patients were sent into nursing homes after the directive, more than 40% higher than what the state had previously reported.<br />In January state Attorney General Letitia James released a report on an investigation into complaints about how the nursing homes handled Covid-19. Two findings stand out. First, that “a larger number of nursing home residents died from COVID-19 than” the official data reflected. Second, that the March 25 directive “requiring the admission of COVID-19 patients into nursing homes may have put residents at increased risk of harm in some facilities and may have obscured the data available to assess that risk.”</td>

The Labor Department is bringing back a career lawyer who was fired after she waged an unfounded years-long smear campaign against  Oracle .<br />Janet Herold spearheaded Labor’s 2017 lawsuit against Oracle, alleging systemic pay discrimination against women and minorities. The complaint was based on paint-by-numbers statistical patterns and found no evidence that Oracle intentionally discriminated. An administrative law judge eviscerated Ms. Herold’s complaint in September, noting in a 280-page opinion that “There was no good evidence for [Labor’s] allegation that Oracle’s executives knew about, hid, and ignored widespread disparities.”<br />This had long been clear, which is why one of Ms. Herold’s senior colleagues sought to settle the Oracle case for $10 million to $20 million. Yet Ms. Herold insisted it could be properly settled for no less than $150 million to $300 million. The largest such settlement in history is $14 million.<br />So why was Ms. Herold so adamant? “The most critical part of this enforcement action is the public airing and discussion of common industry pay practices which depress the wages of women and people of color,” she wrote to the department’s Solicitor, adding that a public trial would “damage [Oracle’s] reputation in the industry and hinder their ability to retain top talent.”<br />Ah. So the case was intended to be an identity-politics show trial. Ms. Herold also pushed allegations against Google of “systemic compensation and hiring discrimination” against women and Asians. Last week Google settled for a modest $3.8 million.</td>

The bank reduced other executives’ pay for the same reason, saying they shared responsibility for the problems. In the order, issued in October, regulators told Citigroup to fix its risk-management systems and flagged “significant ongoing deficiencies.”<br />Mr. Corbat’s pay included a $1.5 million salary, a $5.26 million cash bonus and $12.27 million in stock-based compensation.<br />The board said the bank’s financial results in the pandemic were strong.

By night’s end five strangers would each instinctively make crucial decisions. The result, according to police, was that the life of an 11-year-old boy likely was saved.<br />There is a lesson in what took place, and it starts with what a woman named Flaviane Carvalho saw.<br />She was serving meals to a table where a family of four was sitting. Three of the people—an adult male, an adult female, and a four-year-old girl—were sitting on one side, seemingly enjoying themselves. The boy was on the other side, not being spoken to and not speaking. He was the only one for whom the adults had not ordered food. Ms. Carvalho thought this was odd.<br />Then she noticed bruising near the boy’s eye, and a cut above his nose. And more bruising on his lower arm. She could have done nothing.<br />But she couldn’t just let it go. On a piece of paper, in big letters, she wrote: “ARE YOU OK?” She stood behind the table and held the paper up so only the boy, alone on the other side, could see it. He made a motion with his head. She sensed he was afraid. So she wrote another message: “DO YOU NEED HELP?”</td>

Happily for the next victim but not the latest one, the paper has belatedly seen the error of its ways.<br />Donald G. McNeil Jr. “has done much good reporting over four decades,” said management even as it escorted him out the door. Executive Editor Dean Baquet had previously declined to fire Mr. McNeil over the two-year-old incident, saying it was clear the term hadn’t been uttered in a “hateful or malicious” way.<br />But that was before a tsunami of intolerance from the forces of tolerance inside the paper. Mr. Baquet announced last week that Mr. McNeil would be leaving after all because “we do not tolerate racist language regardless of intent.” Oops, it was universally pointed out that the Times then would have to fire itself. A Factiva search shows the paper using the word 1,271 times as far back as 1969 and as recently as a week ago, as it must in covering the world. The new standard, “a threat to our journalism,” was “a deadline mistake and I regret it,” Mr. Baquet admitted on Thursday.<br />What a mess. I don’t know Mr. Baquet. By all accounts, he’s a fine person and a good reporter, but you know what he’s behaving like here—he’s behaving like somebody who knows he can’t trust his own boss to back him in any decision unpopular with the woke mob.<br />Contrary to myth, the last thing John Kennedy was saying in “Profiles in Courage” was that persons in authority at every moment should be ready to throw away their livelihoods over a matter of principle. Mr. Baquet won’t get advice from me on whether his job is now impossible, or, for that matter, whether it’s doubly important that he stick around for après moi reasons.</td>

      <td></td>
      <td>When she regained consciousness in a Chicago hospital in 1968, Bette Howland, then 31, couldn’t move, see or speak. “You will be reborn,” a mysterious voice told her. Appropriately enough, the voice turned out to belong to her mother. This scene of renewal marks the beginning of “W-3,” Howland’s account of her internment in the hospital’s psychiatric ward—and the reissuing of “W-3” signals the ongoing renewal of Howland’s career.<br />Between 1974 and 1983, Howland published three books: “W-3” and the story collections “Blue in Chicago” and “Things to Come and Go.” After winning a MacArthur fellowship in 1984, she stopped writing and disappeared from public view. Decades later, in 2015, Brigid Hughes, the editor of the literary journal A Public Space, discovered “W-3” in the dollar bin at a used bookstore. This revelation led to the appearance of “Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage,” Ms. Hughes’s selection of Howland’s writing, and to a revival of interest in the author’s brilliantly observant work.<br />Like her career, Howland’s psychological health suffered a precipitous dip. During the events of “W-3,” she was a young divorcée with two children, making do with a “dingy flat, crummy job, constant money worries. Everything you earn goes to doctors and baby-sitters. . . . A life full of reproaches, self-hatred.” Ultimately, these difficulties contributed to a suicide attempt—the reason she landed in the hospital.<br />Yet even as she describes her fantasy of ending it all, she can’t resist pointing out an absurd facet of her plan: It inevitably involves the medicine cabinet. “Now here’s a curiosity: Why the medicine cabinet? The pills were actually right beside my bed. But never mind, it seems there has to be a medicine cabinet . . .” Howland loves a good curiosity; her business, in “W-3” and throughout her oeuvre, is with the odd detail and the odd person out. Drawn to the eccentrics who populate Chicago—and her family in particular—she vividly renders the social worlds within the movie theater, the public library, the courtroom and the living room, attending to the essential strangeness of each person she describes: the librarian who irritates patrons by bellowing; the uncle who goes out of his way to break the law, driving “around the block looking for a No Parking sign or a nice little fire hydrant.” At the library, Howland writes in her dazzling story “Public Facilities,” “the level of tolerance for individual extremes was very high. It had to be—the facts were too peculiar.” But the library has nothing on W-3, the ward where this memoir takes place.<br />Howland’s fellow patients include Zelma, who shows up in evening dress and opera gloves, marching in “as if she owned the place,” with “seven pieces of matched luggage, smooth pale leather; two wigs with stands; a portable TV.” Whenever the phone rings in the ward, it’s for Zelma. Then there’s Trudy, who “perambulated down the corridors lashed to her intravenous stand—bandages, pajama strings loosened and streaming—looking like a sort of injured parade float.” “A poacher by nature, like a cuckoo,” she shows up uninvited in other people’s bathrooms, shower stalls and beds.</td>

      <td>An argument that links between the surge of migrants into Europe and a rise in violence against women must be addressed.</td>
      <td>‘This book is about mass migration, sexual violence, and the rights of women in Europe,” declares Ayaan Hirsi Ali in the introduction to “Prey.” A refugee from Somalia and a migrant herself, Ms. Hirsi Ali has given her book a title that is unsparing and indignant—intended, no doubt, to make us sit up and pay attention. She believes, and seeks to persuade us, that women in Europe are now the sexual quarry of young, unmoored men from Muslim countries over whom the police and the courts appear incapable of exercising control. “We in the West are used to seeing women everywhere around us,” she writes, before telling us that in certain quarters of Brussels, London, Paris and Stockholm “you suddenly notice that only men are visible.” These are no-go zones for women, who “erase themselves” from public places in such neighborhoods. “We are witnessing a challenge,” Ms. Hirsi Ali says, “to the rights that European women once took for granted.”<br />Almost three million people have arrived illegally in Europe since 2009, close to two million in 2015 alone. Two-thirds are male, and 80% of asylum applicants are under the age of 35. “The intensification of the Syrian civil war,” Ms. Hirsi Ali writes, “was the largest proximate cause for the migrant influx.” There is no shortage of data on Europe’s sexual violence in her book. Some examples: There was a 17% increase in rapes in France from 2017 to 2018; in Germany, the number of victims of rape and “sexual coercion” rose by 41% in 2017; and in Sweden, there was a 12% increase in reported sex offenses in 2016—astonishing ratios that may have abated recently, she explains, only due to restrictions resulting from Covid-19.<br />Ms. Hirsi Ali, a research fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, is a longstanding critic of extremist Islam. In “Prey,” she offers us page after page of grim statistics and asserts, credibly, that we can see “a prima facie case for the view that the surge of immigration into Europe” in 2015 led to “a significant increase in sexual violence in the countries that accommodated the largest numbers of migrants.” The migrants are from societies marked by patriarchy and polygamy, where women are “commodities.” These men, she explains, “see no reason to alter their views simply because they now live in western Europe.”<br />Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, draws Ms. Hirsi Ali’s ire for her decision in 2015 to do away with an upper limit on the number of asylum-seekers who could come to Germany. “It is one of the rich ironies of early-twenty-first-century history,” she writes, “that the single decision that has done the most harm to European women in my lifetime was made by a woman.”<br />The worst single incident of sexual assault by migrants occurred in Cologne on Dec. 31, 2015—New Year’s Eve—when hundreds of men (mostly newly arrived asylum-seekers of Arab and North African origin) “mobbed together to entrap women” in the area between the city’s central railway station and its storied cathedral. In the following months, 661 women came forward to report themselves as victims of sexual attacks that night. The official response was one of paralysis, as police and prosecutors struggled with the fear of being seen as racist. By the spring of 2019, a mere 52 of the alleged assailants had been indicted, of whom only three were convicted of sex offenses.</td>

      <td>Politicians begging Washington for a bailout have been doling out raises to government workers.</td>
      <td>As part of his proposed $1.9 trillion relief bill, President Biden wants to send $350 billion in unrestricted cash to state and local governments to fill their budget holes. But while Covid-19 has depressed state tax revenue, the prospect of federal aid has encouraged many of these supposedly blameless states to keep piling on costs. Nowhere has that been more evident than with the pay raises dished out in recent months to government employees. As private businesses hold on by their fingernails, public-sector labor unions have their hands out, demanding the pay raises set forth in labor contracts negotiated before the pandemic ravaged public finances.<br />In Connecticut, where unemployment was 8% in December after topping 10% this summer, state workers have pocketed two rounds of raises: a 3.5% bump in July and another worth about 2% earlier this month. Gov. Ned Lamont had initially suggested postponing the raises—“to lead by example”—but the labor union 1199 SEIU blitzed the airwaves with television commercials accusing unnamed politicians of wanting to “take away” their wages. Mr. Lamont folded.<br />In December, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan let planned 2% raises continue, claiming revenues “have improved enough for us to be able to fulfill our commitments to state employees.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo used special powers to postpone certain planned hikes for state employees. But Mr. Cuomo has indicated he’ll use federal aid to pay those raises retroactively, and let others continue outright. Most New York school districts went ahead with raises this summer.<br />Automatic pay increases regardless of economic conditions are an unimaginable proposition in the private economy. Many government employees collected their full pay and benefits while not working during the spring 2020 lockdowns. The pandemic has laid bare a fundamental problem with public-sector collective bargaining: Taxpayers should never be on the hook for raises that don’t reflect future economic realities—especially when politicians have a personal interest in pushing costs into the future.<br />That’s essentially what’s happened in New Jersey, where Gov. Phil Murphy withdrew his threat to lay off state workers after his largest union agreed to take furlough days and postpone—but not forgo—raises. Affected employees will get three pay bumps totaling 6% beginning this summer, though most won’t come due until after Mr. Murphy faces voters in November.</td>

Empire State citizens deserve an answer and  federal law enforcement ought to be interested as well.<br />The New York Post’s Bernadette Hogan, Carl Campanile and Bruce Golding break the story of an appalling abuse of power:<br />Ms. DeRosa is now claiming that Team Cuomo was cooperative and transparent in sharing information with the U.S. Department of Justice. But New York’s failure to publicly acknowledge its nursing home death toll and prioritize the protection of the elderly—the state instead inflicted broad, destructive lockdowns on the general population—had consequences far beyond New York. The state was an early virus hot spot and its false data presented a misleading picture of Covid impact as scientists and policy makers sought to understand the new health threat.<br />In the wake of the Post report, Jesse McKinley and Luis Ferré-Sadurní of the New York Times note:<br />One wonders how long the truth about nursing home deaths might have remained hidden if a few stout-hearted contrarians like Janice Dean of Fox News, the Albany Times-Union newspaper and the Empire Center think tank had not diligently challenged the official story.</td>

      <td>The answer to Francis X. Rocca’s “Can Catholic Social Teaching Unite a Divided America?” (Review, Feb. 6) is, unfortunately, no. Catholic social teaching may have something for both left and right, but the progressive wing of Roman Catholicism has more in common with secular progressives than with conservative Catholics and other Christians. Closing the ideological and moral divide within the U.S., Catholicism and Christianity in general is not likely to be a win-win. One side considers loving and taking care of your neighbors to be a personal responsibility. The other wants the state to take care of neighbors in need by taking resources from other neighbors. Conservative Christians will render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, as instructed, but do not expect Caesar to relieve us of all obligations to neighbors, nor will we ever expect Caesar to create a progressive heaven on earth.<br />Ryan Graham<br />Melbourne, Fla.<br /><br />The conservative Catholics’ point is that if Joe Biden continues to support abortion, he and others like him cannot have a meaningful discourse on real solutions to what ails society because a fundamental understanding is missing: God is love. All of God’s creation has value and must be loved. Trying to solve social issues without having the conversation about the value of human life is like trying to grow a plant without acknowledging the critical element of its root system.</td>

President Trump’s gains with blacks and Hispanics demonstrated that their political convictions are more malleable, which Mr. Alba attributes in part to “racial mixing.” No doubt intermarriage and a more complex idea of racial and ethnic identity contribute to that, but there is another powerful factor that moves people over time from left to right on the political spectrum, and it is strangely absent in debates in our “woke” culture: social class.<br />The left portrays racial and ethnic minorities (with the exception of Asians, Jews, and other successful groups) as hapless victims of historical oppression, and who are now in need of government (i.e., taxpayer) largess to make up for those historical inequities. However, people of color who have worked hard over a generation or two and have earned their place in the middle class often resent the condescension of whites diminishing their successful efforts by attributing their success to liberal policies.

Holman Correctional Facility to accommodate inmate Willie B. Smith III’s final request. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas separately indicated that he would let the execution proceed.<br />That means either Justice Samuel Alito or Justice Neil Gorsuch—or both—took Mr. Smith’s side.<br />Mr. Smith was convicted of the 1991 murder of Sharma Ruth Johnson, 22 years old, whom he and a teenage accomplice first kidnapped and robbed when she stopped at an ATM in Birmingham, Ala. The jury voted 10-2 for a death sentence instead of life imprisonment.<br />Alabama said Mr. Smith was being treated fairly because prison policy currently allows no inmate to have a minister alongside as they are put to death. Mr. Smith argued that a 2000 federal law, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, required the state to accommodate his request.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The definition of criminal incitement has come to play a pivotal role in the Senate trial of former President Donald Trump, even though no criminal offense is necessary for a conviction under impeachment proceedings.<br />Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said Thursday that in making their case that Mr. Trump incited the Jan. 6 insurrection by his supporters at the Capitol, House managers have all but ignored “whether and how the conduct of President Trump met the legal standard of incitement.” Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) concurred, saying, “I was really disappointed they didn’t engage much with the legal standards.”<br />Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who leads the House impeachment managers, argued before the Senate that Mr. Trump’s actions amounted to the “high crimes and misdemeanors” the Constitution sets forth as grounds for impeachment—and also could be prosecuted under the stricter standards of criminal law.<br />Mr. Trump’s defense lawyers say nothing Mr. Trump has done amounts to incitement under any legal measure.<br />The criminal standards for incitement were defined by a 1969 Supreme Court decision, Brandenburg v. Ohio, which found that the First Amendment protects even speech that advocates violence or breaking the law unless it is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”</td>

Insight is also currently seeking $875 million for its first fund focused exclusively on preferred equity investments.<br />Insight provides between $10 million and $350 million of equity for technology companies, particularly software companies, across a range of capital structures that span venture rounds to larger buyouts of public companies.<br />The firm focuses on subsectors that include software-enabled services and internet companies, as well as software-as-a-service companies, which have subscription-based business models that often generate strong recurring revenue, according to documents from Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System.

      <td>The Washington, D.C., museum looks forward to its second century with a new exhibition, ‘Seeing Differently.’</td>
      <td>The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., America’s first museum dedicated to modern art, was the product of a pandemic. In 1918, the art collector Duncan Phillips lost his only brother, James, to the flu that was ravaging the globe; their father, a Civil War veteran and businessman, had died of a heart condition not long before. In 1921, Duncan Phillips honored their memory by turning his home into a museum, originally named the Phillips Memorial Art Gallery.<br />A century later, in the midst of another pandemic, the Phillips is celebrating its anniversary with a new exhibition, “Seeing Differently: The Phillips Collects for a New Century.” Scheduled to open March 6, Covid restrictions permitting, the show features about 250 works chosen from the museum’s collection of more than 6,000 objects. Senior curator Elsa Smithgall said that the exhibition organizers worked with a 13-member community advisory board, which hewed to Duncan Phillips’s collecting philosophy of embracing “a multiplicity of types of works and types of perspectives.” The results include paintings, quilts, sculpture, photographs, works on paper and videos by an international array of artists.<br />The centennial show is organized around “the way that artists explore the complexities of our ever-changing world through four lenses,” Ms. Smithgall said: the senses, identity, history and place. The first section, on the senses, is meant “to hit people with a really powerful sensory experience around color,” she explained, with works such as Alexander Calder’s 1939 wire sculpture “Hollow Egg” and Alma Thomas’s “Breeze Rustling Through Fall Flowers,” a 1968 acrylic on canvas with bands of rich color on a pale background. The 2011 work “Scramble” by Leo Villareal, a commanding five-foot-square grid of light-emitting diodes, hangs near quilts made in Gee’s Bend, Ala., that echo its bright squares.<br />Works in the identity section show “how art can open a window into our understanding of self and how we also see the other,” Ms. Smithgall said. Among them are “Melancholy,” Degas’s evocative portrait from the 1860s of a wistful woman curled into an armchair, and “Untitled (Hood 2),” a 2016 photograph by John Edmonds of an individual whose identity is hidden by a sweatshirt. “Maman Calcule,” a 2013 work by the Belgium-based Congolese artist Aimé Mpane, is a mosaic portrait of a woman in Kinshasa composed of hundreds of carved plywood tiles. There are also portraits by El Greco and Goya, along with self-portraits by Paul Cézanne, in full beard and high-collared jacket, and Milton Avery, in red beret and scarf, a cigarette drooping from his lips.<br />The history section of the show homes in on three topics: Revolution and War, Migration and Displacement, and Slavery and the Legacy of the Civil War. Among the works on display is Honoré Daumier’s “The Uprising,” a scene from 1848’s revolutionary events in France, in which a woman wearing a white shirt and cap surges forward amid the faces and top hats. Duncan Phillips acquired the painting in 1925 and considered it one of the finest in the collection. It is joined by 30 panels from Jacob Lawrence’s “Migration Series,” which chronicles the experiences of African-Americans heading to northern states in search of better lives.</td>

      <td>Civil-rights advocates abandon the old ideal for the new term, which ‘has no meaning’ and promises no progress but makes it easy to impute bigotry, says Shelby Steele.</td>
      <td>The first time Shelby Steele used the word “equity” in one of his books—“White Guilt,” published in 2006—he was referring to the value his father had accrued in restoring “three ramshackle homes to neat lower-middle-class acceptability.” This was in 1950s Chicago, a city the author describes as “virulently segregated.” Shelby Steele Sr., a Southern-born black truck driver who’d left school in third grade to work the fields, concealed his homeownership from his white employer. He was afraid he’d be fired for “getting above himself.”<br />No bank would loan the elder Steele money, so he used bricks, discarded lumber, and cast-off roofing shingles to render the properties rentable. “That’s what we used to call equity,” says Mr. Steele, the son. “The sense of the word I grew up with has no relationship at all to the meaning it has taken on today.”<br />Mr. Steele, 75, is a longstanding conservative commentator on race in America and a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. We speak over Zoom a week after President Biden signed an Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity, intended to address “entrenched disparities in our laws and public policies, and in our public and private institutions.” In his remarks at the signing, Mr. Biden seemed to suggest that his is a project aimed at reshaping American governance. “We need to make the issue of racial equity not just an issue for any one department of government,” the president said. “It has to be the business of the whole of government.”<br />I can almost hear Mr. Steele growl in his study in Monterey, Calif., as I read these words aloud. “This equity is a term that has no meaning,” he says, “but it’s one that gives blacks power and leverage in American life. We can throw it around at any time, and wherever it lands, it carries this stigma that somebody’s a bigot.” Its message is that there’s “inequality that needs to be addressed, to be paid off. So if you hear me using the word ‘equity,’ I’m shaking you down.”<br />Equity in this “new sense,” Mr. Steele says, can be understood only as “a strategy.” The president is promising to “fix America morally, and aligning himself with the strategy of black people to gain power by focusing on victimization. He’s saying, ‘America must tackle that problem and create programs that help minorities achieve equity’—whatever that may be.”</td>

      <td>As we’ve quarantined at home, our needs for privacy, security, flexibility, floppability and beauty have changed the way we want to live. Here, 13 décor trends courtesy of 2020.</td>
      <td>LAST AUGUST, interior-design blogger Lydia Elder found herself buying something that never would have darkened her door before the pandemic hit: a blush pink beanbag chair. “Schools were closed, and with our family of four at home all the time, we needed some extra, flexible seating,” she said. Now everyone in her 1,610-square-foot household in Kent, England—including her 6-foot-6-inch husband—is besotted with the smushy seat and, what's more, her young children have found it obligingly stands in for a volcano, mountain or quicksand. “It’s given us an extra place to relax that can be transferred across rooms depending on where the rest of the family is, and how much peace and quiet you want,” Ms. Elder said.<br />The trials of lockdown have led us to crave decorating solutions from easily hauled seats to lush wallpaper murals that transport us to inaccessible locales. As homeowners and interior designers have come up with intrepid fixes for current conundrums, the ingenuity has given rise to micro-trends. These 13 struck us as the most clever and doable.<br />The big, dark rectangle has always been a décor crasher, but with all the ever-present computers we need to work and learn remotely, the television is one more black hole. “We just don’t want to see [the TV] all the time anymore,” said Toronto designer Colette van den Thillart. She has concealed five of them since the pandemic started, hiding one behind a 1940s chinoiserie screen. In a London home library local designer Rose Uniacke camouflaged the telly behind fabric in the 1882 William Morris pattern of the wallpaper—to serenely seamless effect.<br />A seat with an undeniable nostalgia factor, the beanbag chair was introduced in 1969, when Italian designers Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro unveiled the Zanotta “Sacco” chair at the Paris Furniture Fair. Today the beanbag’s flexibility as a movable seat has brought it back as Americans struggle to improvise quiet spots in a crowded home. On Instagram, #beanbag counts 438,000 posts, and FatSak, a South African beanbag brand, reports a 200% spike in year-over-year sales this January. A rakish pompom denotes the top of one of our favorite blobs, a Hershey’s Kiss-shaped corduroy version. Corduroy Beanbag—Caramel, $165, burkedecor.com<br />Ms. van den Thillart admits she initially viewed rechargeable lamps with skepticism, fretting the light would be “crappy—too blue.” Still, seeking maximum flexibility from limited space, she decided to try them in her crowded home. After toting one from bedside to bathtub, she found it “completely life-changing. Every time I take one to a client, I lose it because they won’t give it back.” Philippe Malouin’s gracefully arched Arca Portable lamp has four settings, from ambient to task, and lasts up to 30 hours before needing a boost.  $275, mattermade.us</td>

      <td>The romantic label for swashbucklers used by Tampa Bay’s NFL team has the same Caribbean roots as a term for barbecuing pork</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />When the Tampa Bay Buccaneers celebrated their Super Bowl victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, they did so in a style befitting their name: with a rowdy boat parade.<br />In Wednesday’s nautical celebration, a flotilla of boats carried Tom Brady and his carousing teammates along the Hillsborough River near downtown Tampa to the city’s port. The procession resembled Tampa’s annual Gasparilla Pirate Festival commemorating the legendary pirate José Gaspar, known as “the Last of the Buccaneers.”<br />The team’s name brings to mind romantic images of swashbucklers on the high seas. But the origins of the term go back to hunters grilling the meat of wild animals in the Caribbean.<br />When Europeans began colonizing Latin America, they incorporated many indigenous practices. One was slow-roasting meat over a fire using a wooden framework. In Taíno, spoken on several Caribbean islands, this cooking method was called “barbacoa,” which was borrowed into Spanish and eventually gave rise to the English word “barbecue.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration says it won’t be ending tariffs on imported European wine, cheese and other food imports any time soon—to the dismay of industry groups who say the levies are hurting U.S. restaurants and consumers.<br />The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Friday it was unnecessary for now to suspend the levies, which were imposed by the Trump administration as part of a longstanding dispute with the European Union over commercial aircraft subsidies.<br />In a regulatory filing, the USTR said it would “continue to consider the action taken in the investigation,” referring to a 17-year-old dispute over how governments subsidize  Boeing Co.  and  Airbus SE .  The Biden administration has said it is reviewing the tariffs and other major trade policy actions adopted by the previous administration.<br />Under the Trump administration, the dispute turned into a tariff fight that snared food and beverage industries unrelated to aircraft manufacturing. Washington imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European wine and food items like cheese and olives in late 2019.<br />The European Union hit back with levies on U.S. whiskey, nuts and tobacco valued around $4.5 billion. The U.S. stepped up the sanctions on Dec. 31 with additional tariffs, placing virtually all wine imports from France and Germany under its 25% tariff.</td>

      <td>BEIJING—Chinese authorities refused to provide World Health Organization investigators with raw, personalized data on early Covid-19 cases that could help them determine how and when the coronavirus first began to spread in China, according to WHO investigators who described heated exchanges over the lack of detail.<br />The Chinese authorities turned down requests to provide such data on 174 cases of Covid-19 that they have identified from the early phase of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. The investigators are part of a WHO team that this week completed a monthlong mission in China aimed at determining the origins of the pandemic.<br />Chinese officials and scientists provided their own extensive summaries and analysis of data on the cases, said the WHO team members. They also supplied aggregated data and analysis on retrospective searches through medical records in the months before the Wuhan outbreak was identified, saying that they had found no evidence of the virus.<br />But the WHO team wasn’t allowed to view the raw underlying data on those retrospective studies, which could allow them to conduct their own analysis on how early and how extensively the virus began to spread in China, the team members said. Member states typically provide such data—anonymized, but disaggregated so investigators can see all other relevant details on each case—as part of WHO investigations, said team members.<br />“They showed us a couple of examples, but that’s not the same as doing all of them, which is standard epidemiological investigation,” said Dominic Dwyer, an Australian microbiologist on the WHO team. “So then, you know, the interpretation of that data becomes more limited from our point of view, although the other side might see it as being quite good.”</td>

Andrew Cuomo after learning his administration held off releasing a fuller accounting of Covid-19 deaths in the state’s nursing homes out of its fear that former President Donald Trump’s administration would politicize the information.<br />A top aide to the Democratic governor told Democratic state lawmakers in a private meeting this week that a U.S. Department of Justice probe last year prompted the Cuomo administration to sideline a request from state legislators to say how many nursing-home residents died from the virus after they were transferred to hospitals.<br />The New York Post on Thursday night first reported the details of the Wednesday meeting based on a recording. The Cuomo administration released a partial transcript of the meeting on Friday.<br />“We froze,” Melissa DeRosa, the governor’s secretary, said according to the transcript. “We were in a position where we weren’t sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice or what we give to you guys and what we start saying was going to be used against us and we weren’t sure if there was going to be an investigation.”<br />Republicans said Ms. DeRosa’s statements were an admission that the governor was purposefully covering up the administration’s actions, and reiterated calls for an independent probe.</td>

      <td>After decades in an industry obsessed with youth, the designer writes in her new book that ‘you can feel better and be better with age’</td>
      <td>Norma Kamali was 29 in 1975 when she left her husband of 10 years and the fashion company they had built together. On her own, she had $98, a small Manhattan apartment with a mattress, and her self-esteem, which was fragile but intact. She loved designing clothing but had no idea how to run a business.<br />“I was in a really bad situation,” Ms. Kamali says. She usually kept her problems to herself, but her story tumbled out in a meeting with a Los Angeles Times fashion editor, who swiftly arranged a loan of some sewing machines. “I started to realize that communication is everything,” Ms. Kamali, 75, says over Zoom from her company’s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. “If people believe in you, they can actually help.”<br />Ms. Kamali borrowed money from friends and family to launch a new business in 1976 called OMO (“On My Own”) Norma Kamali. That same year, Farrah Fawcett wore a red swimsuit designed by Ms. Kamali in an iconic photograph. (The suit is now part of the Smithsonian collection.) Christie Brinkley made famous another Kamali swimsuit—a high-cut, lavender bikini—on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine the following year. By 1980, when her pioneering designs for chic clothes made from sweatshirt material had department-store shoppers lining up around the block, Ms. Kamali had little trouble paying back her creditors.<br />Looking back, Ms. Kamali admits to learning some lessons the hard way. Among the most valuable, she says, was the decision to set off on her own. “Walking away is one of the most important things I’ve learned in my life,” she writes in her new book, “I Am Invincible,” which she calls “a handbook on aging with power.” Leaving a relationship or a business deal is never easy, she notes. But in situations that threaten your soul or your integrity, walking away “signifies being in control and aware of your worth.”<br />As the sole owner and designer of her eponymous company for 45 years, Ms. Kamali has earned an ardent following for her ingenuity and longevity. Designs that she conceived decades ago, such as her early swimsuits and her stylishly warm sleeping bag coat, remain bestsellers, even as editors praise her latest collections as among her best to date. In an industry known for ephemerality, Ms. Kamali has a rare knack for staying relevant. Her modish, user-friendly designs have kept her factories humming through the pandemic, which lends further credence to a book filled with her advice.</td>

      <td>Turkey’s most hypnotic city isn’t as inaccessible as you think. You can teleport yourself there anytime with these TV shows, films, dishes, books and at least one psychedelic rock ’n’ roll band.</td>
      <td>FOR MOST AMERICAN visitors, Turkey’s biggest city is familiar and surprising at the same time. Stroll the streets of Istanbul and you’ll find Apple Stores, Shake Shacks and chic, hijab-covered women Rollerblading along the seaside, all against an age-old soundtrack—the call to prayer streaming through the speakers of the city’s countless mosques. It’s not so much about East meeting West; Istanbul’s cultural abundance makes those very categories feel obsolete. The city’s innumerable attractions—the Ottoman-era palaces, the sumptuous art museums, the sensational food and shopping—all make it a magnetic destination. For intrepid travelers, Istanbul is still a top temptation given that Turkey is one of the few countries that currently allows U.S. tourists. Americans are welcome as long as they show proof of a negative Covid-19 test (though the CDC still deems Turkey, as well as most of Europe, highly risky in terms of the virus). But like a lot of places right now, Istanbul lacks its usual swagger. For the last two months, this city of 16 million falls silent every weekday at 9 p.m. under a strictly enforced curfew. On weekends, residents can leave their homes only for grocery shopping. Restaurants are open just for takeout or delivery during the week, and only delivery on weekends. Tourists are exempt from curfews, and hotel restaurants can serve meals to guests, but the streets empty of locals can feel ghostly. Until those streets fill up again, you may prefer to explore the city another way—by sampling some of the music, movies, books and tastes that will surely make you want to visit in the flesh just as soon as the time is right.<br />In this lyrical memoir, Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk recounts his childhood growing up in a well-to-do household. He intersperses his personal experiences with historical accounts of Istanbul by noted visitors, including Gustave Flaubert, using his reflections on various sites and neighborhoods to examine not only his own identity as a writer but how Istanbulites see themselves and their place in the world.<br />A 2018 Pulitzer Prize finalist for nonfiction, Hansen’s book is primarily a study of the impact of American policies and actions in the Middle East. But the chapters set in Istanbul also vividly capture the intelligence, color and humor of the people she encounters. For an armchair traveler, it’s the next best thing to meeting locals in person.<br />The main sleuth in this breezy Istanbul-based mystery—the fourth and most recent of Mehmet Murat Somer’s popular Turkish Delight series—is Burçak Veral, a transvestite who dresses like Audrey Hepburn. She also serves as a highly entertaining and food-obsessed tour guide to the city.<br />If you want to try preparing Turkish dishes at home, “The Turkish Cookbook,” by Musa Dagdeviren covers the broad range of Turkey’s cuisine. Mr. Dagdeviren spent years travelling the country to preserve regional recipes, a journey also chronicled on  Netflix ’s  “Chef’s Table” series. Here are three local specialties recommended by Mr. Dagdeviren, each one a culinary history lesson.</td>

Mars-Wrigley will be there, too, handing out Snickers, “the official chocolate of the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games.”<br />What might have seemed like a no-brainer—backing a popular sporting event in a country with 1.4 billion consumers—may turn out to be a high-risk gamble. The Olympics could mark the crescendo of a yearslong trend of some consumers, advocates and Western lawmakers pointing out what they consider the true costs of working with a country where horrifying human-rights abuses have been cataloged by journalists and U.S. officials. At a time when global companies rely more heavily than ever on the Chinese market, its government has proven easily triggered by the slightest criticism—and unafraid to exact economic punishment on those who cross it politically.<br />Already advocates are asking  Airbnb Inc.,  another Olympic Partner, why its lodging is available in a country where Uighurs in the province of Xinjiang are housed in concentration camps, subjected to forced labor and other abuses.<br />Airbnb is one of many companies that tout themselves as corporate models of social responsibility, highlighting volunteer programs and nonprofit outreach in ways that are increasingly a consideration for consumers deciding how and where to spend their money. When it comes to China, such activists say, the company appears to be less concerned.</td>

      <td>Female investors have a cautious view of equities. That is a problem—for women as well as the rest of the finance world.</td>
      <td>“I think we’re a bit outnumbered, but we’re here.” So said one commenter on a Reddit thread about whether women joined in the recent WallStreetBets trading frenzy.<br />Female investors largely sat out the riskiest punts taken on stocks like GameStop. That may be no bad thing considering the videogame retailer’s stock is down over 80% from its late-January peak. But low female participation in stock-market investing more generally is a problem, for women and the finance industry alike.<br />Less than one-quarter of deposits into U.S. brokerage accounts were made by women in January, according to consumer-spending data analytics firm Cardify. Globally, the situation may be even worse: Israel-based brokerage eToro said that female investors make up just 14% of its registered users, most of whom are in the U.S. and Europe.<br />Some trading platforms did a good job of signing up women during the pandemic. Just over a third of Robinhood users were female at the beginning of this year, up from 20.5% a year before, according to Cardify. For the finance industry as a whole, though, attracting more female custom remains a frustratingly slow work in progress.<br />Women tend to be more conservative investors than men, preferring to put their wealth into real estate, cash or bonds while steering clear of equities.  Credit Suisse  surveyed a sample of existing clients and found that almost half of its female customers have 90% of their wealth tied up in low-yielding cash and fixed income—well over double the exposure the Swiss bank recommends.</td>

      <td>One of the Civil War’s bloodiest episodes left a lasting imprint on those who fought—and many who didn’t.</td>
      <td>“The real war will never get in the books.” Walt Whitman’s well-known prediction has not prevented thousands of writers, including Whitman himself, from trying to put the Civil War between covers. Many kinds of chronicles have been written—military histories, political studies, overviews of society or culture, portraits of leading figures. One especially striking way of bringing the war alive is to convey it from the standpoint of the unexalted individual. That is the choice John Matteson makes in “A Worse Place Than Hell,” a moving group portrait that uses the Battle of Fredericksburg, in late 1862, as the focal point for the story of five participants in the Civil War, four Northerners and one Southerner.<br />The battle that Mr. Matteson highlights has attracted a lot of scrutiny over the years, most notably in Francis Augustín O’Reilly’s “The Fredericksburg Campaign” (2003) and George C. Rable’s “Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!” (2002). These books give details of the fateful encounter near the Rappahannock River on Dec. 13, 1862, in which Army of the Potomac under Ambrose E. Burnside met resounding defeat at the hands of Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. The futile assaults by waves of Union soldiers on Confederate troops, who were protected by a stone wall on Marye’s Heights, have become a fixture of Civil War lore. On that grim winter day, the Union suffered more than 12,000 casualties, compared with some 5,300 on the Confederate side. President Lincoln put a positive spin on the battle by praising the surviving Union soldiers for their bravery. Privately, however, he confessed that the battle had left him in “a worse place than hell.”<br />Although Mr. Matteson uses Lincoln’s phrase for his title, he doesn’t dwell on the hellish aspects of the war. Instead he concentrates on personal and cultural transformation. The people he follows were profoundly changed by the war, he tells us; all of them “confronted war and struggled to redeem themselves within it.” Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the son of a famous Boston physician and author, entered the war as an idealistic man and emerged from it hard-bitten and skeptical, leading him to seek direction in a legal career. The Rev. Arthur Fuller, the brother of the women’s rights champion Margaret Fuller, served as a chaplain in a Massachusetts regiment but at Fredericksburg traded his ministerial role for a military one, taking up a gun in a burst of patriotism and losing his life to Confederate bullets. The budding author Louisa May Alcott, hoping to contribute to the Northern cause, became a volunteer nurse in a Washington war hospital, an experience that fed into her popular book “Hospital Sketches” and later provided the emotional background for “Little Women,” a fictionalized portrayal of the Civil War’s toll on her Concord, Mass., family.<br />As for Walt Whitman, he was writing poems and newspaper stories in Brooklyn and hobnobbing with bohemians when he heard that his brother George had been wounded at Fredericksburg. He traveled first to Washington and then south to the environs of the battlefield in search of his brother, whose wound, as it turned out, was not serious. Walt stayed on for several years in Washington, taking on minor government jobs while serving as a volunteer nurse in war hospitals, setting the stage for his later role as the major poet and memoirist of the war. Two of Whitman’s poems about Lincoln, “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d” and “O Captain! My Captain!,” are timeless eulogies of America’s greatest president, and his writings about the war, in poetry and prose, are at once crisply realistic and emotionally resonant. George Whitman, Walt’s brother, ended up serving in many Civil War battles and thus provides, in Mr. Matteson’s narrative, a kind of moving lens on the war as it unfolded on the battlefield.<br />In addition to these Northerners, Mr. Matteson describes the dashing John Pelham, a Confederate artillery officer who exhibited unusual courage. At Fredericksburg, partly hidden by a dip in the land, Pelham coolly supervised the firing of a cannon that was protected by its very proximity to Union troops: Their return volleys mainly went over the heads of the rebels. Pelham’s death at the Battle of Kelly’s Ford, three months after Fredericksburg, becomes in Mr. Matteson’s handling a dramatic, hopeless flourish of Confederate chivalry. Pelham charged forward on a horse like a blond god of war before being felled by an enemy shell fragment. The loss of Pelham was a blow for Confederate morale. Mr. Matteson writes: “No individual in the Confederate Army had seemed more invincible than Pelham. His risks had never been punished, and his audacity had been continually rewarded. If he could fall, so, too, might the army he left behind.”</td>

      <td>Traveling the world, a writer looks for clues to the future in the urban world of the past.</td>
      <td>Do Americans like cities?<br />Small towns? Emphatically. Suburbs? Even more so, to judge from how many people live in them. A “li’l ol’ country place” is where Mr. Blandings builds if he can.<br />There are U.S. places where the values of old Europe abide: In New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, or Boston you get a sense that the citizens love the center and would live there if there were enough room for them all. In Italy, Spain and France, civic pride springs from ancient notions of the polis and aristocratic traditions of what makes an environment noble. But the U.S. owes a lot to England, where the cult of country life outscores urban priorities. The All-American protagonist of the old TV series “Green Acres” longed for Hooterville, while his Hungarian wife pined for Park Avenue. To EU eyes, most U.S. urban neighborhoods look extemporized, undignified, hastily weatherboarded and easy to vacate. Families don’t cling to home: The pursuit of happiness scatters them.<br />When the going gets tough, Americans abandon cities with astonishing alacrity. Hence the widely scattered ghost towns: the ill-tilled gardens of Detroit; the echoing sidewalks of Gary, Ind.; the half-vanished populations of Cleveland and Youngstown, Ohio; and, in Scranton, Penn., President Biden’s haggard hometown. When factories fall, rivers shrivel or mineral veins bleed out, people move on.<br />In “Four Lost Cities: A Secret History of the Urban Age,” science journalist and fiction writer Annalee Newitz, who is reluctant to let capital determine fate, wants people to choose where to live and how to work in the land of the free. The book wavers between rival explanations for writing about why people “lose” cities. Sometimes more reasons appear for choosing city life in the first place, or for why people put so much work into doomed structures. Much attention focuses laudably on retrieving residents’ lives from middens, graffiti, and the layout of sewers, or ruts in the roads; elsewhere, the author concentrates on the misdeeds of elites that make those lives intolerable. Early on, readers learn that the book was written in refuge from—perhaps expiation for—the suicide of the writer’s estranged father. The reaction seems unusual: Most people, according to their means, might erect a monument, endow a charity, or leave flowers. But the author is a journalist, and it is no sin to labor in one’s vocation.</td>

      <td>A Ming dynasty classic of action-packed hilarity gets a fresh translation.</td>
      <td>The books that Sinologists commonly refer to as the Four Great Classics of Chinese literature are the court romance “Dream of the Red Chamber,” the sprawling military chronicle “Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” the outlaw adventure “The Water Margin” and the supernatural quest fantasy “Journey to the West,” the last of which now appears in an abridged edition from Penguin Classics in a new translation and with a fittingly playful new title, “Monkey King” (339 pages, $30). Published during the Ming dynasty in 1592, “Monkey King” is the comic relief of the quartet, a rollicking work of high buffoonery whose stature in East Asian culture, according to translator Julia Lovell, “may be compared with that of The Canterbury Tales or Don Quixote in European letters.”<br />Authorship of “Monkey King” has been ascribed to a knockabout writer-for-hire named Wu Cheng’en (ca. 1506-1582), though Ms. Lovell notes that the attribution is at best an educated guess. The outline of the story is based on the journeys of a real figure, the seventh-century monk Xuanzang, who traveled from China to India in search of sacred Buddhist scriptures. But “Monkey King” travesties the typical pilgrimage narrative by laying its focus on Xuanzang’s chief disciple and bodyguard, a shape-shifting, smart-talking, excessively pugilistic primate.<br />Monkey King (who is given the name Sun Wukong) gains his otherworldly powers at the feet of great Buddhist masters, who teach him the Way of Immortality and the 72 Transformations. Thus equipped, he claims the audacious title “The Great Sage Equal to Heaven” and bullies his way into Heaven itself, where he makes no end of mischief for the Jade Emperor and his celestial consorts. Only Gautama Buddha is able to subdue the interloper (during their confrontation, Monkey King pees on the Enlightened One) and finally pins him beneath a mountain for 500 years.<br />This is classic fish-out-of-water comedy, and the Jade Emperor is disturbed less by Monkey King’s rampages than by the fact that his presence in such distinguished settings threatens to “erode hierarchy and order.” The jokes hit every register, from slapstick and toilet humor to dryly delivered drolleries: “Now we must remind you that the Great Sage Equal to Heaven was, when all was said and done,” the author adds, “still a monkey demon.”<br />The condition of Monkey King’s release is that he provide protection to Xuanzang on his long trip to India to bring back Buddhist texts “that can release mortals from vexations, calamities, and transgressions.” They’re joined by a pig-fiend called Pigsy and a river monster called Sandy, who, Lucifer-like, were also banished from Heaven for insubordination. The novel settles into an episodic structure, with each chapter centering on the many monsters and hostile kingdoms they encounter during their travels. There are instances of heroism and moral instruction—Monkey King’s arc is redemptive—but the form is essentially, as Ms. Lovell writes, that of “an action-packed situation comedy,” with recurring gags, ridiculous challenges to overcome and a lot of cheeky crosstalk. The literary analog for the gonzo humor is Rabelais and the fight scenes are the stuff of superhero comics. But the comparison that kept coming to my mind is with the irreverent, twinkling humor of Looney Tunes cartoons, with Monkey King a cross between Bugs Bunny and the Tasmanian Devil.</td>

      <td>If sex is among the most potent human drives, the deity who embodied it must have been a power player.</td>
      <td>Close your eyes and think of Venus. What image comes to mind? Perhaps Botticelli’s bored teenager in her scallop shell; maybe the Venus de Milo, serene, lovely and just a touch bovine; perhaps Titian’s meretricious “Venus of Urbino,” lying on her back caressing her genitals. At any rate, a ravishingly beautiful young woman, probably blond and almost certainly not wearing many clothes.<br />Bettany Hughes is out to convince you that the face of Venus familiar to us today—simultaneously salacious and saccharine—conceals a much darker and more complex character. The Roman goddess Venus, like her Greek counterpart Aphrodite, was “far more than just a gorgeous goddess of love”; in fact, Ms. Hughes argues, she wasn’t really interested in “love” at all, let alone beauty or romance. Aphrodite was a goddess of fierce and violent sexuality, the forceful tamer of men and beasts, the mother (by her lover Ares) of the lesser gods Dread and Fear. Divine patron of Valentine’s Day she was not.<br />Any children’s book about the Greeks or Romans will tell you that each god had his or her own special domain: Ares was “the god of war,” Hera was the “goddess of marriage,” and so on. There can be no doubt that sexual desire was central to the ancient “meaning” of Venus-Aphrodite. The Greeks called sex ta aphrodisia, “the works of Aphrodite” (whence the modern English “aphrodisiac”). The problem, as Ms. Hughes fully recognizes, is that Aphrodite was also the goddess of all sorts of other things. She presided over Greek civic magistrates, the unity of the citizen body, safe travel by sea, military leadership and the battle-rage of Greek warriors; on the eve of the Battle of Salamis in 480 B.C., Plutarch tells us, the women of Corinth prayed to Aphrodite to inspire their husbands with “passion for battle against the barbarians.”<br />There are two different ways of accounting for the breadth and messiness of Venus’s divine portfolio. One is to suppose that an “original” goddess of sexual desire picked up a set of random additional functions over time—what Robert Parker has neatly called the snowball theory of the Greek gods, “the idea that as a god rolls down through history it picks up new functions and powers that need not cohere with its original nature or with one another: rather like a multinational company that starts out selling records and ends up running an airline.”<br />In some ways, this theory works quite well for Venus-Aphrodite. The Greek Aphrodite, for all her associations with fertility and virility, was never seen as a mother-goddess. But in the first century B.C., as Ms. Hughes vividly describes, the Romans developed a major new cult of Venus Genetrix, “Venus the mother.” In this new incarnation, Venus was worshiped as the ancestor of Julius Caesar via the mythical hero Aeneas and his son Julius, and thus served as the mother-patron of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and the people of Rome more generally. This new aspect of Venus as an ancestor-mother is a classic example of the snowball in motion, a completely new set of associations bolted on to her “central” character as a goddess of violent sexuality.</td>

      <td>Selected by the author, most recently, of ’22 Minutes of Unconditional Love.’</td>
      <td>By Scott Spencer (1979)<br />1. Before Scott Spencer’s novel was made into not one but two cheesy movies, it began life as a remarkable, sexually explicit novel about youthful desire. David Axelrod, the book’s narrator, recounts the story of his wild if doomed passion for 16-year-old Jade Butterfield and his love for her unconventional family. Disaster follows when Jade’s father dictates that the young couple take a 30-day vacation from the affair—an order to which David responds by setting the Butterfields’ house on fire, driven by the belief that by putting out the fire and saving the Butterfields, he’ll be viewed as a hero. He is, to the contrary, committed to a mental institution. Years later, he’ll have a vision—a scene set in an empty theater in the middle of the night: “And now for this last time, Jade, I don’t mind, or even ask if it’s madness: I see your face, I see you, you; I see you in every seat.”<br />By Marguerite Duras (1984)<br />2. An autobiographical tale that begins in 1929, “The Lover” tells the story of a brief affair between an impoverished 15-year-old French girl living in colonial Saigon and a much older Chinese-Vietnamese financier. The girl is spellbound by her lover’s car and by the elegance of his clothes as well as his “English cigarettes.” Although she looks barely older than a child with her thin, undersize body, the man is clearly infatuated with her. She quickly recognizes her power: “From the first moment she knows more or less, knows he’s at her mercy.” She knows, as well, the intense pleasure she derives from this sexual union. It is an affair carried on in the face of social pressures—there are the matters of race and class to consider. All this is reflected in spare and eloquent prose, as Marguerite Duras looks back at her younger self and a wholly different world.<br />By Jenny Diski (1986)</td>

      <td>The threats to a culture’s collective memory can come from neglect—or more sinister forces.</td>
      <td>Why would an army target a university library with incendiary shells, leaving buildings around it intact? Why would an author choose to consign years of impassioned writing to the flames? The answer is simple. As an official in the British Empire once observed, while overseeing the purge of a colonial archive, “What’s burned won’t be missed.” Richard Ovenden, director of the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, is acutely aware of the many ways in which books and paper archives cease to exist: not only through deliberate destruction—acts of moral outrage, retribution, even efforts to literally erase history—but also simple neglect, perhaps a more sinister threat because it so often goes unnoticed. Fortunately, he has devoted a great deal of time to thinking about these disasters and how to prevent them. His compelling thoughts are now gathered in the eminently readable (and provocatively titled) “Burning the Books: A History of the Deliberate Destruction of Knowledge.”<br />Mr. Ovenden views himself as one in a line of librarians going back to the Bronze Age and to Apollonius of Rhodes at the library of Alexandria. He urges us to remember that “although the technologies of creating knowledge, and the techniques for preservation have altered radically, their core functions have changed surprisingly little.” Mr. Ovenden believes that what is handed down over time, from Alexandria to the Bodleian, is the “ethos that knowledge holds great power,” and that “its loss can be an early warning sign of a decaying civilisation.”<br />Mr. Ovenden begins at the beginning, with the library of Ashurbanipal, beneath the ruins of Nineveh, in modern-day Iraq, a city so ancient it was already long desolate when Greek warrior-historian Xenophon passed through over 2,000 years ago. In the 19th century, tens of thousands of tablets were unearthed at the site by British and French archaeologists (energetically pursuing their hereditary rivalry). The tablets recorded administrative and bureaucratic activity, as well as oracular queries and divination. The most celebrated ones hold the epic of Gilgamesh, among the world’s earliest works of literature. Although some of King Ashurbanipal’s library survived, much was burned and smashed by vengeful Medes and Babylonians generations after his reign had ended. As Mr. Ovenden points out, “the survival of the collections themselves is accidental.”<br />The most famous library to have disappeared is that of Alexandria, a towering structure, “said to contain a vast ocean of knowledge, razed to the ground in a fiery blaze.” Mr. Ovenden suggests that “in some ways the destruction of the library has become as important, if not more, to its legacy as its existence.” The fabled immolation is variously attributed to Caesar, a Christian patriarch, or a Muslim caliph who was said to have used the scrolls to heat his baths. It was Edward Gibbon, in his “Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” who transformed the loss into such a potent symbol of barbarity, the violent disregard or even hatred of knowledge (Gibbon dismisses the tale of the caliph’s depredations). It is a peculiar paradox that the library of Alexandria symbolizes at once the urge to accumulate knowledge and the barbarous impulse to destroy it. The mundane truth is that the library likely dissolved slowly, “both through organisational neglect and through the gradual obsolescence of the papyrus scrolls themselves” rather than in a single great conflagration. “Alexandria is a cautionary tale of the danger of creeping decline.”<br />Nevertheless, “Burning the Books” is black with the ashes of libraries: Islamic “storehouses of knowledge” leveled by Mongol raiders in the 13th century; medieval scriptoria put to the torch by Vikings; monasteries dissolved under Henry VIII, when “tens of thousands of books were burned or broken up and sold as scrap.” Such despoliation led Sir Thomas Bodley to found his library at Oxford, hailed by Francis Bacon as “an ark to save learning from the deluge” (however, all but a handful of the books originally in his library were seized and wrecked by “Reformers”). The United States Library of Congress burned twice, once at the hands of a ruthless British army in 1814 and again, by accident, on Christmas Eve 1851. It is estimated that 100 million Jewish books were lost in the Holocaust. Half a century after V-E Day, Serbian militia shelled the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo, instructing their snipers to pick off librarians attempting to save books from the blaze.</td>
