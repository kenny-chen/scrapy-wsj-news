      <td>Deputy attorney general never worked as a prosecutor but has taken a leading role at the Justice Department in recent corporate cases</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who President Trump said Monday would succeed outgoing Attorney General William Barr, is expected to lead the Justice Department in an acting capacity until President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.<br />Since his confirmation to the No. 2 post in May 2019, Mr. Rosen has taken a leading role on some corporate cases, including the antitrust case against Google. He doesn’t have prior experience as a prosecutor.<br />He will take over the top job at the Justice Department upon Mr. Barr’s departure on Dec. 23. Mr. Barr resigned on Monday. Other Justice Department officials said they didn’t expect Mr. Rosen to deviate from Mr. Barr’s policies. However, they noted he had been involved in sensitive litigation that the White House had an interest in, including a lawsuit against Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, over the publication of his book in June.<br />Mr. Rosen has spent most of his career in the private sector and at several other government agencies. They include the Transportation Department where he served in the No. 2 job before joining the Justice Department as deputy attorney general.<br />In October, Mr. Rosen, 62 years old, unveiled the Justice Department’s case against Google, alleging that the search giant is illegally preserving its monopoly status by engaging in anticompetitive tactics that shut out future innovators from challenging its dominance. “I think we do go through these tech phases,” Mr. Rosen said in an interview at the time, adding: “I think it’s not uncommon that they raise some antitrust issues.”</td>

      <td>Group Nine Media, owner of websites such as The Dodo and NowThis, is considering using a blank-check company to acquire some of its competitors, according to people familiar with the matter, as the digital-media sector continues to consolidate.<br />In recent weeks, Group Nine Media has consulted with advisers about the possibility of pursuing deals through a special-purpose acquisition company, also known as a SPAC, the people said. Those blank-check companies raise capital by going public and can put the proceeds into deals.<br />Group Nine Media is interested in acquisitions that could grow its audience and give it more bargaining power with online advertisers.<br />The venture-backed company, which formed in 2016 through the merger of several digital-media businesses, has already begun buying competitors. Last year, it purchased PopSugar, a women-focused digital publisher, adding its site and web properties to a portfolio that includes animal-focused The Dodo and NowThis, a news publisher.<br />It isn’t clear which company or companies Group Nine Media would target for acquisitions. Group Nine’s all-stock deal with PopSugar valued Group Nine at $600 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.</td>

      <td>The Attorney General was the right man for the job in hyper-partisan times.</td>
      <td>William Barr resigned as Attorney General on Monday, effective Dec. 23, and he’s certainly earned the right to leave early. He has been the right man at the right time for that difficult job, with the principles and toughness to make difficult decisions despite bitter Democrats in Congress and a willful President Trump.<br />Mr. Barr had already been AG once so he didn’t need the title. He took the job in a Washington marked by no-limits partisanship knowing that he would be criticized no matter what he did. But he wanted to clean up a Justice Department that he rightly knew had been tainted by a corrupt FBI under James Comey and political appointees in both parties who lacked the courage or tenacity to take responsibility for hard prosecutorial judgments.<br />His achievements included navigating the end of the Robert Mueller probe while protecting the office of the Presidency from unconstitutional conclusions about obstruction of justice. Future Presidents of both parties will thank him.<br />He was willing to endure media and Democratic smears by taking fresh looks at old investigations. This included hiring U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine how the FBI could decide to investigate the 2016 Trump campaign as a Russian front. His release of documents has helped to show the FBI probe began in partisan scheming and unlawful practices, and Mr. Durham is staying on the job and may have more to report and indictments.<br />Mr. Barr also had the guts to ask another U.S. Attorney, Jeffrey Jensen, to re-examine Mr. Mueller’s prosecution of Michael Flynn. That probe turned up more malpractice and a decision to dismiss charges that never should have been brought. Mr. Barr used the lessons of these misguided probes to impose new rules and limits on political investigations.</td>

      <td>Holding the next AG accountable for how the case is handled.</td>
      <td>Even as Attorney General William Barr prepares to leave office after resigning on Monday (see nearby), effective Dec. 23, Republicans and many on the right are demanding that he appoint a special counsel to investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. The better idea is to make the next AG responsible for how that case is handled.<br />Hunter acknowledged last week that his “tax affairs” are under investigation by federal prosecutors, who are also looking into his influence-peddling via deals with Chinese interests and a Ukrainian gas company. Most of the media ignored the story before the election, and we warned this could create troubles for a President Biden. And here we are.<br />One problem among many with special counsels is that they are often politically unaccountable, wandering into areas far beyond their remit. Robert Mueller’s team never did find proof of Russia-Trump collusion. But they did torment Michael Flynn on an unrelated charge that was unjustly brought. A special counsel can also bury a case in secret for years, and an AG can duck questions by saying that’s the special counsel’s job.<br />The U.S. Attorney for Delaware is reported to have opened a Hunter investigation in 2018, and there is good reason to believe it can complete its work—barring political interference. This would be the preferred outcome, since Democrats would have a harder time claiming any future charges brought by career prosecutors were politically motivated. Meantime, any effort by a Biden Justice Department to transfer staff, dictate outcomes, or shut down the probe would leak and have political costs.<br />A Republican Senate would also be watching if the GOP secures at least one Georgia runoff seat on Jan. 5. The country was alerted to Hunter’s potential legal jeopardy by Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley, who in September issued a detailed report about Hunter’s deals in Ukraine, Russia, China and Kazakhstan. The Senators continue to investigate and they’d have subpoena power.</td>

Mr. Biden is balancing several factors, including diversity, gender and geography, the people said, along with expertise in areas like environmental justice, which calls for laws and regulations to treat historically disadvantaged groups fairly. Much of the decision-making is connected, with choices for some posts influencing who gets chosen for others.<br />Rep. Deb Haaland (D., N.M.) is a leading contender for Interior secretary, according to people familiar with the matter. If confirmed, she would be the first Native American cabinet secretary. Activists and progressives are pushing for a Native American to run the agency, which oversees federal lands and the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Ms. Haaland’s stock has risen among some of Mr. Biden’s advisers in recent days. But some Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about losing another lawmaker to the administration because of their slim majority in the House.<br />Ms. Haaland and Biden teams are in discussions, but no offer has been made, according to a person familiar with the matter. Retiring Sen. Tom Udall (D., N.M.), whose father served as Interior secretary, is also among the potential candidates, as is former Deputy Interior Secretary Michael Connor, who also has Native American heritage.</td>

      <td>Senate Democrats lay out their green agenda for financial markets.</td>
      <td>Democrats accuse President Trump of politicizing the Federal Reserve, and sometimes not without cause. But look who’s now demanding that the central bank and other financial regulators accommodate their plans to politically allocate capital.<br />The Senate Democrats’ Special Committee on the Climate Crisis recently issued a report detailing how the Fed and eight other regulatory agencies should penalize investment in fossil fuels and promote green energy. They claim financial institutions are underpricing the risk that carbon-intensive assets will become “stranded.”<br />Mind you, their worry isn’t about how climate change per se would devalue investments, which financial institutions already account for. They want a warning about the costs of government climate policies. “Because Congress has not advanced any comprehensive climate policies in the last decade, the market has not priced in the possibility of significant federal action,” the report notes.<br />“This process—or more accurately, the mere realization that this process is imminent—will drive down the value of assets tied to the carbon-sensitive energy, electric power, and transportation sectors, among others,” Democrats warn. “The risk of holding this type of asset, which will lose value in a low-carbon economy, is referred to as transition risk.” In other words, Democrats want to kill your business, so please account for the hospitalization and burial costs.<br />For starters, Democrats want the Fed to use capital and liquidity standards and annual stress tests to make banks—and potentially also insurers and asset managers—price in these unknowable political risks. They want regulators to assign carbon-intensive assets higher risk weights, so banks would have to hold more capital against them. This would discourage banks from financing such investments, while “green” investments would be deemed lower risk.</td>

      <td>Another diplomatic normalization shows Israel’s greater clout.</td>
      <td>Israel’s era of diplomatic good feeling presses on, with the Jewish state winning recognition last week from Morocco in North Africa and over the weekend from Bhutan in South Asia. The majority-Buddhist Himalayan kingdom of less than a million people may not be a strategic powerhouse, but its normalization shows that Israel’s new diplomatic standing extends beyond the Persian Gulf.<br />Unlike the Abraham Accords involving the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, the U.S. didn’t broker the deal between Israel and Bhutan. The agreement was signed in India. Yet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that Bhutan’s recognition was “additional fruit of the peace agreements.”<br />It’s also fruit of Israel’s economic and strategic clout in South Asia. India’s trade with Israel—including military equipment—has been steadily increasing as its economy grows, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Netanyahu have warm relations. Bhutan is a close Indian partner and China has stepped up disputes along the kingdom’s borders.<br />One payoff for the U.S. of the Abraham Accords was the promise that they could lead to increased investment in Israeli technology from wealthy Arab states, displacing Chinese capital. If the Bhutan-Israel agreement further strengthens Israel-India ties, that also redounds to the benefit of the U.S. as it tries to balance China’s influence in Eurasia.<br />As Joe Biden begins Middle East diplomacy, he will be engaging with an Israel that is in a stronger strategic position than when he was last in the White House. He says he wants to build on the Trump Administration’s diplomatic progress between Israel and the Arab world, and a November Journal report suggests Saudi Arabia is holding out on recognizing Israel in the hope of using it to improve its standing with the Biden Administration.</td>

She said she was fired in April.<br />“Pinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture,” the company said in a joint statement with Ms. Brougher.

Throughout the pandemic, she said, she has feared bringing the virus home to an adult daughter with autism who needs her mother’s help to dress, shower and eat.<br />Michelle Mitcheson, a nurse, felt apprehension about getting a vaccine that had been authorized for emergency use but not fully approved by federal regulators, but said she would get one. “I am willing to take some degree of risk in order to do the most good for the majority of the population,” she said.<br />Physician assistant Patrick Coppler hoped to get the vaccine quickly, he said, but not before emergency responders who have less control over exposure to contagious patients.<br />The three health-care workers are among 60,000 at UPMC, the hospital system and health insurer affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh, and about 740,000 across Pennsylvania according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, who will be the first to receive the Covid-19 vaccine because of their critical jobs and risk at work. But with supply tight in first shipments, hospitals across the U.S. have been forced to decide who goes first, with plans in flux up to the final days.<br />The Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use—the first to get such a green light—late Friday, setting in motion UPMC’s push to notify individual employees who will get the opportunity to receive the earliest shots. By Monday, the first UPMC health-care workers finally had an answer to who would be offered the vaccine.</td>

      <td>Major foundations back a proposal that would force smaller donors to spend down their funds.</td>
      <td>It takes a fine sense of irony to start the season of giving by trying to limit Americans’ generosity. Yet that would be the outcome of a high-profile legislative proposal unveiled on Dec. 1, “Giving Tuesday,” conceived by former hedge-fund manager John Arnold and Boston College law professor Ray Madoff. The proposal would stifle Americans who want to support worthy causes but aren’t superrich. It would also further the goals of progressive politicians who seek to punish charitable giving they don’t like and can’t control.<br />The “Initiative to Accelerate Charitable Giving” is framed as a way to force the wealthy to give more. It enjoys the backing of some of America’s biggest and most prominent foundations, including Ford, Kresge, Kellogg and Hewlett. These large and powerful institutions are effectively trying to dictate how smaller and less influential donors give, which dovetails neatly with the goals of progressive politicians and activists.<br />The centerpiece is a series of regulations on donor-advised funds, a popular option for philanthropists outside the 1%. While the foundations supporting the initiative control a combined $38 billion, the average donor-advised fund has a little more than $166,000 set aside for charity. Donor-advised funds allow individuals to donate as much as they like annually, even a few hundred dollars. Some choose to give right away, while others take a long-term approach, waiting to align their priorities with the needs of the communities they aim to serve. These funds also provide donors with the option of privacy—the particular focus of political attack.<br />Donor-advised funds have multiplied. The number of accounts has risen by more than 300% since 2010, and as their popularity has grown, so has the criticism. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse routinely savages them, since he can’t see and therefore attack or control who gives to them. Yet the vast majority of givers are supporting critical services helping people in need, and liberals use donor-advised funds to support their favored causes too.<br />The Arnold-Madoff initiative would starve them of funding. Most notably, it encourages Congress to pass legislation that would force donor-advised funds to disburse money within 15 years or lose tax deductibility, pushing more money into the hands of tax collectors instead of charities. The 15-year marker is entirely arbitrary, and discriminatory: The foundations that back the proposal would still be able to hold their tax-advantaged funds in perpetuity. Yet donor-advised funds already have a higher payout rate than the required minimum payout for a foundation—approximately 20% compared with 5%—even though they have only a tenth of the $1 trillion managed by foundations. Donor-advised funds and private foundations alike should have the option to address the needs of communities over a longer time horizon.</td>

      <td>Even as Covid-19 cases surge world-wide, the arrival of viable vaccines holds the promise of a return to something resembling normality by the middle of next year. But the commercial real-estate sector may never get back to normal, and that could spell trouble for banks.<br />Many banks are concentrated in and dependent on commercial property lending. Banks hold half of all commercial real-estate loans. The 5,000 or so U.S. community banks, with about a third of total assets, are two to three times as concentrated in commercial real-estate lending as the approximately 30 larger banks.<br />Problems in commercial real estate can hurt banks in two ways.

      <td>Want better instructors at universities and colleges? Then emphasize teaching, not research, when recruiting faculty members.</td>
      <td>As the pandemic has forced most colleges and universities to adopt remote instruction, it’s worth remembering that more than 50 years ago some schools voluntarily experimented with remote instruction via televised classes. That did not go well either. Students did not feel the same connection to their instructors and that, in turn, made a difference in what was learned. “It’s better to have a poor instructor in the classroom,” said one unhappy professor in 1967, “than to have a good one on TV.”<br />The vignette comes from Jonathan Zimmerman’s “The Amateur Hour: A History of College Teaching in America.” Mr. Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania, has braided together a smooth narrative from many short pieces of thread, consisting of glimpses into the experiences of faculty members, students and administrators from the early 19th century up through the 1990s, and encompassing two- and four-year institutions, large and small, elite and not. The book is economical in its presentation of materials, gathered from 60-plus archives, and even-handed in presenting the gripes of instructors and students.<br />The book’s clever title refers to the way that higher education, when hiring, evaluating and rewarding faculty, gives most attention to research productivity and little to teaching effectiveness. Partly this is due to the difficulty of measuring effectiveness in the classroom, but it is also due to the resistance of faculty members to having their teaching reviewed by peers—something that would, Mr. Zimmerman says, “make their teaching truly professional.”<br />“The Amateur Hour” begins with the recitation model of college teaching, which was near universal in the early 1800s. Students were asked to read an assigned passage and then, at class time, recite either a summary or, some professors might insist, the passage in its entirety. When lectures began to displace recitation, some college presidents worried aloud about the problem of keeping students actively engaged throughout the class session. The Yale Report of 1828 wondered whether the student attending a lecture “may repose upon his seat and yield a passive hearing . . . without ever calling into exercise the powers of his own mind.”<br />As more students enrolled in higher education, hiring did not keep pace. Class sizes grew, and students had less contact with professors. Previously, faculty members at small liberal-arts colleges knew every student on campus and could demonstrate personal concern for them. By the late 19th century, however, many American faculty members were trained in Germany and brought back with them a passion for research, as well as more interest in libraries and laboratories than in students. In 1887, Julius Seelye, the president of Amherst College, lamented the changes: “Education is a wholly personal work. It is not gained by books, or by instruction alone, nor by anything in place of the living inspiration of the living teacher.”</td>

      <td>How a Joe Biden Justice Department could investigate Biden’s son.</td>
      <td>Will Hunter Biden wake up to a special counsel in his Christmas stocking?<br />News reports say President Trump wants his attorney general to name one. The law says a special counsel is warranted in a criminal investigation when leaving it to the Justice Department presents “a conflict of interest.” It’s hard to imagine a more unambiguous conflict of interest than the one Hunter Biden presents: A Joe Biden Justice Department investigating his son over conduct that might also implicate the sitting president.<br />Even so, a special counsel is a bad idea.<br />Two weeks ago, Mr. Barr announced that in October he’d appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham as special counsel for the investigation into the origins of the FBI’s Russia-collusion probe. He did so to ensure Mr. Durham could finish his investigation regardless of the election outcome.<br />The argument was that the magnitude and nature of the allegation—that those at the uppermost levels of the government abused their power to intervene in a U.S. election and then to undermine a duly elected president—made appointing a special counsel the lesser of evils. It’s a strong argument, and it has persuaded many who otherwise rightly regard the institution of special counsel as pernicious.</td>

And he probably won’t be the last. But he probably is the first American president to be called a liar by so many large mainstream news organizations in their news accounts.<br />Not just National Public Radio, either. The  New York Times  uses the word “lie” and “liar” referring to Trump in its headlines. When the newspaper of record does this, it is cheered by all those who despise Donald Trump.

      <td>Critics are already attacking the incoming Biden administration, raking it  for sending mixed signals on China. The Biden Team is playing a sort of good cop, bad cop with Beijing—Jake Sullivan urges Americans to support Australia against Chinese pressure as John Kerry muses about grand climate deals with Beijing. But a mixed-signal strategy at this stage is, if anything, beneficial to Team Biden. It’s the new administration’s potential for later fuzzy thinking when it comes to great power rivals such as China that should worry onlookers.<br />Sending mixed signals is a standard diplomatic technique. Iran has been using a good cop, bad cop strategy against the U.S. for decades, and it has paid off pretty well. There’s no reason an American president shouldn’t give it a try.<br />True, Beijing doesn’t appear to be seeking relationship resets: China is behaving aggressively toward India, Australia and others. Confrontational Chinese “wolf warrior diplomats” continue to be prominent. Still, the Trump years have been a wild ride, and giving Beijing a chance to decide whether it wants to deal with the good or bad cops in the Biden administration will at least clarify U.S. choices.<br />But while a good cop, bad cop routine in December 2020 won’t derail the new team, failing to deal effectively with the challenge a rising China poses to America and its Indo-Pacific allies could.<br />Though there is much to criticize about the Trump administration, its members understood that without geopolitical success it doesn’t really matter what Americans think about climate change, human rights or the politics of gender. If the U.S. had lost World War II, Franklin Roosevelt’s ideas about human rights and multilateral institutions would be historical curiosities.</td>

Because while he’s been embraced by the broader listening public, there’s an unusual intensity to the connection he has with his most devoted fans. The strength of that bond owes a lot to his willingness to make his emotional travails the focal point of his work. Beginning with his 2009 debut album, “Man on the Moon: The End of Day,” Kid Cudi has portrayed himself as an artist of rare vulnerability. His persona, that of a depressed and lonely man self-medicating with potent marijuana and other intoxicants, appealed to the listeners who shared his anxiety.<br />Besides his bond with his audience, Mr. Mescudi’s cult status owes something to his wild inconsistency. His artistic gifts include melody—he sings and raps—and a sharp ear for production, but his writing can be dull on a line-by-line basis and he has trouble assembling coherent album-length statements. In addition he sometimes follows his muse down blind alleys—he’s indulged his fondness for grungy alternative rock in both a misfired side project (the 2012 self-titled record from his duo WZRD) and a dreadful and unbearably long release under his own name, 2015’s “Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven.” His just-released seventh LP, “Man on the Moon III: The Chosen” (Republic), avoids these fatal pitfalls and is one of his most engaging albums from end to end.</td>

The shirt is part of Ms. Deneuve’s vintage-inspired capsule collection for A.P.C., which also includes a mod skirt, block heels, wool sweaters and other classics with a distinctly Parisiantwist.<br />Ms. Deneuve, 77, is well versed in style—after all, the French actress was dressed by Yves Saint Laurent himself for her starring role in the racy 1967 film “Belle de Jour.” “She was 100% confident in her [design] choices,” said A.P.C. founder Jean Touitou. Most pieces in the mini-collection are named for one of Ms. Deneuve’s on-screen roles. This blouse was christened Séverine after the sultry heroine of “Belle de Jour.”<br />Subtle and flirty, the silk-twill top nods to the character’s coquettish charm, but its gently frilled placket is not nearly as exaggerated as the OTT blouses so abundant this winter.<br />An allover paisley pattern—“the standard print of the 1960s,” according to Mr. Touitou—lends the garment a retro flavor. But the Séverine is no relic—the boxy cut is markedly modern and comfortable, making this button-down a compelling choice for today’s WFH lifestyle.<br />The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.

      <td>Google plans to have employees return to offices starting next fall instead of the summer, but the technology giant will test allowing staff to continue working from home for part of each workweek.<br />Google’s parent,  Alphabet Inc.,  now expects that workers will start showing up in offices again in September, according to a report in the New York Times. Google confirmed the report and declined to comment further.<br />That is a shift from an earlier plan that had workers returning in July, and from one that would have required employees to return to work next month. Based in Mountain View, Calif., Alphabet said it had about 119,000 full-time workers as of the end of last year, according to its most recent annual company filing. It also hires contract workers.<br />Google also will pilot an option for employees to work at least three days a week in offices and do their jobs remotely the remainder of the days, according to the report.<br />Companies across the country transitioned workforces to remote work earlier this year to try to halt the spread of the coronavirus. As Covid-19 vaccines are distributed, businesses are sorting out when—and if, in some cases—they plan to require workers to start showing up at offices once again.</td>

      <td>Museums and memorials wowed this year, but, in a socially distanced world, designers are rethinking their approach to built spaces.</td>
      <td>Who could know in October 1929 that the architecture of Jazz Age America was dead, along with the world that created it? After the shock of the Great Crash, sensations like the Chrysler Building looked frivolous and bombastic. In a few years it was clear that people no longer demanded architectural sensations but serious buildings that addressed serious problems, particularly housing.<br />Likewise today; no one can yet predict what the coronavirus pandemic, the ensuing lockdown, the continuing health and safety protocols, as well as the general and lingering feeling of anxiety will mean for our buildings and infrastructure. But it is clear that these things have already brought about a radical reset. It is no longer enough for architects and those of us in the media who cover them to think of “architecture” primarily in terms of the latest eye-catching sensation. Suddenly larger issues are in play, such as the future of the workplace, dealing with the “mass” in mass transit, and even the fate of the city itself.<br />As a result, the buildings completed this year, all designed before the pandemic, already seem the products of a different, more innocent world. Of several distinguished buildings of the arts, the most ambitious is the Kinder Building for the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, which was designed by Stephen Holl Architects and opened Nov. 21. Its geometry is intriguing: Deep notches are cut all along its perimeter, opening it up to the street and prefacing each of its five public entrances with its own elegant forecourt. Above the roof line, the geometry abruptly turns curvilinear in a way meant to evoke the spacious Texas sky (“concave curves, imagined from cloud circles,” as Mr. Holl puts it). Like his groundbreaking Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City, Mo., it also encloses its physical structure with a luminous skin, and at night it glows from within like a box of trapped sunlight.<br />Mr. Holl’s translucent walls are a particularly handsome example of that contemporary architectural feature known as the rain screen. This is the array of panels mounted a few inches in front of a building’s high-tech skin, which acts as an umbrella held sideways, letting any water that trickles through fall safely away in the cavity behind. If Mr. Holl’s building presents a pleated scrim of glass columns, a different approach is offered by the new Oklahoma Contemporary Arts Center, in Oklahoma City, by Rand Elliott Architects. Its rain screen is composed of vertical aluminum fins, set at irregular angles so their light changes and fluctuates as the sun moves, much as a beaded curtain rustles in the wind. The Arts Center had the misfortune to open this past March and then promptly shut its doors, just as the great national lockdown began.<br />Subsequent events have given new significance to familiar things. Just as “Hamlet” seems different after Freud, so buildings seem different after Covid-19. SelgasCano’s Second Home Hollywood in Los Angeles was noted in this space last year as a new kind of flexible office for “nomadic” freelancers and flex-time workers. Then its glass-walled pods and lush tropical plantings seemed merely clever; now they seem visionary. Fresh air is brought into its pods directly, freeing them from the recirculated air of an HVAC system. A dozen firms have already moved in.</td>

Mr. Luskin continues making his case:<br />State and local politicians have devastated businesses they consider nonessential, but a lot of money is still sloshing through the economy. We just need to let people use it. Big banks are certainly flush with cash and ready to lend if politicians will allow businesses to operate.

However, the vote would be only advisory and doesn’t require Unilever to make changes.<br />Major investors say they are putting more emphasis on addressing the threats posed by climate change, with shareholder resolutions on the issue becoming more common.

      <td>In politics, in business, in the cultural discourse that plays out on a never-ending doom loop on our screens and in our heads, the year has been marked by the triumph of cynical expediency, the relentless pursuit of self-interest dressed up as public-spirited principle.<br />Political leaders, business chiefs and the media and entertainment figures they ventriloquize have grasped their opportunities in this tempestuous year to advance their own causes. A pandemic, urban violence, the machinery of electoral democracy—all carefully repurposed and packaged in a gauzy wrapping of useful lies to ensure above all else their gain.<br />Some of the nation’s biggest and most powerful companies exploited an unprecedented human crisis to grow bigger and more powerful, making sure to shed crocodile tears for the losers. Progressive politicians at the local and national levels cynically seized on repeated crises to promote their ideological objectives. Most of the nation’s celebrated newsrooms abandoned the last pretense of objectivity and revealed their selective use and manipulation of facts as little more than propaganda.<br />There are exceptions, but depressingly few to celebrate. The most notable last holdouts to this encroaching empire of dishonesty are the millions of decent and honorable Americans who have suffered unprecedented human and economic damage this year, even as their comfortably distanced, self-aggrandizing superiors lecture them on their ignorance and inadequacy. Lions led by donkeys.<br />Two episodes last week stand as fitting codas to this spectacle, timely examples of the moral corruption eating away at American institutions.</td>

      <td>The gym chain has survived in a disastrous year for competitors, but investors seem unaware that the pandemic has seriously dented its business prospects</td>
      <td>Planet Fitness Inc.  kicked off 2020 by announcing that it would sponsor the television show “The Biggest Loser.” Little did it know that Covid-19 would soon make that an apt label for itself—a crash diet that left its market value 70% lighter in less than a month.<br />Yet, while many large and small competitors were pushed into bankruptcy by the pandemic, Planet Fitness somehow gained all the weight back, and then some. Its shares on Monday morning were trading 8% higher than a year ago. That makes no sense.<br />Planet Fitness has a clever business model that has helped it grow rapidly, but certain elements of it backfired recently. Charging very little and deliberately making it difficult to cancel, its best customers rarely show up but keep paying anyway. Its gyms couldn’t fit them all at once if they did. Even so, turnover is high enough to require constant recruitment of new members by its mostly franchisee-owned stores.<br />The company made an apparent tactical error by drafting dues from members in March even as lockdown orders shut down all their U.S. gyms. Cancellations had to be in person or by letter even as gyms were closed, and members wary of unnecessary trips still can’t do so online or by phone even with gyms reopened. That infuriated those forced to move or who were financially pinched, judging by social-media posts. Membership went from 15.5 million in March to just 14 million at the end of October. The move also artificially flattered third-quarter results reported last month since those monthly revenues were credited for future use and were deferred until gyms reopened.<br />While overall revenue fell by 37% year over year, equipment revenue, the lucrative business of outfitting and periodically refurbishing franchised gyms, tumbled by 71%. The company was forced to offer a discount of 15% on equipment to support new store openings and it gave franchisees a 12-month extension on “development requirements.” Growth in new gyms has, not surprisingly, fallen far short of expectations. Planet Fitness ended the quarter at about one-third of its original 2020 store-growth target and has suspended financial guidance.</td>

      <td>BERLIN— Adidas AG  Monday said it was reviewing the future of Reebok and might sell the U.S. fitness brand—a business it had spent years trying to revamp and that could now fetch several billion dollars, according to analysts.<br />Adidas said a sale was one of the options it was considering as part of a five-year strategy plan it is set to present March 10, 2021. It may also decide to keep the business, the German sports retail group said.<br />Adidas, the world’s second-largest sportswear maker after  Nike Inc.,  bought Reebok in 2006 for roughly €3 billion, equivalent to $3.6 billion, as part of a bid to expand in the U.S. and challenge its bigger rival on its home turf. Reebok at the time was a sponsor of the National Basketball Association. But the plan has disappointed, analysts say.<br />Adidas managed to improve the Reebok business but sales have lagged behind those of Adidas itself and dragged down the group’s profits. In 2016, Adidas Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted launched a turnaround plan for Reebok shortly after taking on the job. He cut costs by closing down dozens of Reebok stores in the U.S. and aimed to make the unit’s management more independent from Adidas.<br />Mr. Rorsted repeatedly opposed calls from some shareholders to ditch Reebok, arguing that the revamp, not a sale, was the answer.</td>

      <td>Antimalarials seemed promising, then failed in trials. That’s how it’s supposed to work.</td>
      <td>Politics has infected many issues over the past four years and has now reached the supposedly objective halls of official medicine. In an editorial for the Journal of the American Medical Association, “Misguided Use of Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19: The Infusion of Politics Into Science,” Dr. Michael Saag claims that “the politicization of the treatment” was more important than the science in promoting the use of the antimalaria drug to treat Covid-19. This evidence-free claim is contradicted by information in the same editorial and the scientific literature.<br />Dr. Saag doesn’t cite a single source to support his claim that President Trump’s April 4 promotion of the drug influenced physicians’ prescribing decisions. His claim that “no health official” in the U.S. government endorsed use of hydroxychloroquine is contradicted in his next sentence, which notes that the Food and Drug Administration approved an emergency-use authorization for hydroxychloroquine on March 28, one week before Mr. Trump’s comments. The FDA granted that authorization at the request of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or Barda, another U.S. government health agency.<br />Physicians prescribed hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 because they had reason to believe it could work. In the early days of the pandemic when there were no established therapies, clinicians noted the severe immune response that the SARS-CoV-2 virus elicited in severely ill patients. They began to deploy hydroxychloroquine because it has long been used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, with a good safety profile.<br />Hydroxychloroquine and its cousin chloroquine had also been studied as antivirals with activity against the similar SARS coronavirus and other viruses. Several encouraging preclinical studies and small clinical trials, including a French study published in March and cited by Dr. Saag, reinforced physicians’ willingness to try hydroxychloroquine.<br />Within a short time, well-conducted clinical trials failed to confirm the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent Covid-19. This is the way medical science is supposed to work. Treatments for new diseases are tried based on a theory and then abandoned when trials fail to confirm their usefulness.</td>

Exxon said it would begin disclosing emissions data related to its products next year.<br />“We respect and support society’s ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and continue to advocate for policies that promote cost-effective, market-based solutions to address the risks of climate change,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said.</td>

But the timeline for children is still unclear. Here’s what parents need to know.<br />Why isn’t a vaccine available for children yet?<br />Researchers have yet to begin clinical trials in children under 12; trials in teens have just recently started. It’s not unusual in drug development to test adults first: New drugs and vaccines are often tested on adults before children, whose bodies are still developing and can have different responses to medication. In the case of Covid, adults are also generally more at risk for severe complications. Covid vaccines for younger children especially may require different dosage levels or formulations than the adult versions. Kids generally can’t get the vaccine until it is approved for their specific age.<br />The result is a delay in children having access to the vaccine, creating uncertainty over whether kids will be vaccinated before the start of the 2021 school year.</td>

We will never waver from our commitment to find out more about Bob’s long captivity, to give the Levinson family the answers they deserve, and to finally bring Bob home.”<br />The two officials designated—Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai—were described as high-ranking officers of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security.</td>

He claimed that thousands of American citizens worked to rig the vote, along with Serbia, Canada, Venezuela, Cuba, the CIA, billionaire George Soros, the Clinton Foundation and many state and local officials from both parties.<br />That conspiracy would suggest, among other things, organizational skills previously unassociated with all those actors. But given that Mr. Wood has more than 750,000 Twitter followers, and that polls show a majority of Republicans don’t trust the election outcome, this seems to be a good moment for a hardheaded look at what completed vote counts across the country actually show.<br />The cold, hard numbers certainly convey sobering realities for the conspiracy theorists, but also for activists of both parties. Above all, they present a clear picture of how the center of the political spectrum held firm in 2020.<br />For starters, Mr. Trump didn’t lose the election in the big cities where he and his allies accuse Democratic mayors and their political machines of rigging the vote. Rather, he lost the election in America’s suburbs.<br />My colleague Dante Chinni’s American Communities Project places every county in America into one of 15 categories based on its demographics, and the project now has tabulated the entire national vote across all counties.</td>

The increase was driven by households earning under $50,000 a year.<br />The spending forecast comes against a backdrop of expected household income gain holding steady at 2.1%,which the New York Fed noted was below the long-run average of an expected 2.8% increase in income.<br />Despite the expected rise in spending, “respondents were more pessimistic about their households’ financial situations in the year ahead, with more respondents expecting their financial situation to deteriorate, and fewer respondents expecting an improvement in their financial situation,” the report said.<br />Meanwhile, survey respondents’ expectation for inflation a year from now rose from 2.8% in October to 3% last month, while expectations for inflation three years from now moved to 2.8%, from 2.7% in October.

But there is some data missing in his analysis—data that reveals that partnership with China, not antagonism, should be pursued.<br />First, competition is a force for change. Without competition, industries become complacent, some even rent-seeking. Mr. Ratcliffe mentions the extremes to which Chinese companies go to steal trade secrets. But stealing trade secrets isn’t new. Challenges from competitors, whether they be states or private actors, often lead to advances.<br />Second, cooperation is possible between rivals. Challenges that cut across borders such as climate change, future pandemics and the impact of Artificial intelligence must be met in partnership. A majority of respondents in a recent poll by the Carnegie Council of voters interested in international affairs found greater interest in peaceful competition versus forcible confrontation with China.<br />Third, social media is redefining geopolitics. Although China is trying to tamp down on dissent, borderless technology is connecting youth movements in a way we haven’t experienced before. And Gen Z is sure to have an increasing say in how countries, diplomats and intelligence agents interact in the coming years.<br />The “us versus them” argument no longer resonates in policy circles or with consumers. Simply put, we need China and the U.S. to work together to thrive.</td>

      <td>Agreement to normalize relations adds to U.S.-brokered realignment in Middle East</td>
      <td>In October, Sudan joined other Arab nations in making peace with Israel, after reaching a deal with the Trump administration to end the African country’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The agreement to normalize relations further shifted the balance of power in the Middle East and northern Africa away from Iran.<br />Sudan is joining a growing list of countries in the region that recognize Israel as a sovereign state, ending decades of hostilities. Getting Sudan’s backing also carries symbolic value for Israel, since Khartoum hosted the famous 1967 Arab League summit in which eight Arab nations approved what became known as the “Three Nos”—no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel and no negotiations with Israel. A White House statement on the deal said the two countries agreed to start economic and trade relations, which could help Sudan revive an economy on the brink of collapse.<br />The normalization of relations followed months of discreet, U.S.-brokered contacts between the erstwhile foes. It started with a February meeting in Uganda between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Gen. Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the military council that runs Sudan’s transitional government along with civilian leaders. The United Arab Emirates, which also recently made peace with Israel and which has close ties to Sudan’s military, hosted talks between Khartoum and the U.S., including on economic assistance. What clinched the deal, however, was a decision by the Trump administration to make the normalization of ties with Israel a precondition for removing Sudan from the list of states the U.S. considers sponsors of terrorism. That designation blocked Khartoum from seeking much-needed help from international financial organizations such as the World Bank and imposed limits on U.S. companies doing business in Sudan.<br />The State Department added Sudan to the list in 1993 for allegedly harboring terrorists, such as members of Hezbollah and al Qaeda, including Osama bin Laden. By doing so, the U.S. says, Sudan assisted in terrorist attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000—charges that Sudan denies. Iran, Syria and North Korea remain on the list.<br />Sudan agreed to pay $335 million for compensation to U.S. victims of the terrorist attacks, following several years of talks between Washington and Khartoum. In recent months, the White House also linked Sudan’s removal from the list to normalizing ties with Israel—a demand that Sudanese officials initially resisted. On Dec. 14, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S. had officially rescinded Sudan’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.</td>

      <td>A one-month timeline from submission to approval is a lightning-fast review for an application that must be several thousands of pages.</td>
      <td>Your editorial “The FDA’s Political Inoculation” (Dec. 4) on the FDA review of  Pfizer -BioNTech’s SARS-CoV-2 vaccine application misses the mark. The FDA is the lead regulatory agency in the world. The stringency of FDA reviews set a high bar. To be sure, two decades in the biopharmaceutical industry has shown me that the process is often plagued with unreasonable requirements and inefficiencies. But the speed of the MHRA’s (U.K. drug regulatory agency) approval of the vaccine has been driven as much by European politics as it has by internal processes. Each regulatory agency has its own style influencing the approval process including timing. Less hostage to the EU’s European Medicines Agency bureaucracy, MRHA can be nimble and set its own priorities and timelines.<br />The standard review takes 10 months (six for a priority review). A one-month timeline from submission to approval is a lightning-fast review for an application that must be several thousands of pages. When assessing staffing and timelines, keep in mind that the FDA still carries the burden of other reviews of new medications beyond those related to Covid-19. The FDA review teams work diligently and now must be working 24/7. Give these highly skilled and committed professionals credit.<br />Coleman Gross, M.D.<br />Berkeley, Calif.<br /></td>

      <td>The $10-a-month app takes on at-home fitness for a competitive price but with an expensive catch</td>
      <td>One revelation I’ve had during the coronavirus crisis is that there is no way I’m paying for a gym again. Working out from home is more affordable and convenient. Depending on the app, it can be pretty dang fun, too. Goodbye forever, grimy locker-room showers. It’s been nice knowing you.<br />Apple ’s  Fitness+ is another digital workout subscription after your gym money. While the new program, launching Monday, arrives late to a well-established, highly competitive app category, it is right on time for people like me, who are still experimenting with different online training solutions. But the app’s chief requirement—that you own an Apple Watch—will likely turn off people who would otherwise give it a try.<br />Fitness+ will appear as a new tab in Apple’s existing Fitness app. A subscription comes with new weekly video workouts across 10 disciplines, including cycling, treadmill running, yoga and strength. An attractive cast of high-energy trainers draped head to toe in  Nike —which has a partnership with Apple—hosts the sessions. Equally energetic music playlists serve as the soundtrack. (For the most part, that is: You can opt for the “Chill Vibes” playlist if that’s your thing.)<br />Compared with similar fitness apps, it is a relatively good deal. Fitness+ costs $9.99 a month, and you can save by paying the $79.99 annual rate. Everyone in your Apple “family”—up to six people—gets access to the subscription. And there are potentially more savings on the $29.95-a-month Apple One Premier plan if you already subscribe to Apple Music and two terabytes of iCloud storage. The most analogous app, Peloton Digital, costs $12.99 a month for one user.<br />There’s a catch with a not-so-small price tag: A Fitness+ subscription requires an Apple Watch, Series 3 ($199) or newer. While the app’s core workout experience is video, streamed on an iPhone, iPad or Apple TV, you can’t access the app without the smartwatch. If you forget to charge your watch, or left it at home while you are traveling, you can still access the videos and do workouts, but you need to physically own an Apple Watch to sign up for Fitness+.</td>

Theoretically, it could occur. Crazy happens! It does. Sometimes.<br />But really, no, absolutely not. No. Don’t be absurd. Right?<br />When 6-1 Northwestern plays 5-0 Ohio State on Dec. 19 in Indianapolis for the Big Ten Championship, there is little expectation that the No. 14 Wildcats will give the No. 4 Buckeyes a game. Ohio State has been installed as a hearty 20.5-point favorite, and the history is bleak; Ohio State has won 32 of the past 33 meetings, including a 52-3 romp in Evanston last year.<br />“They probably shouldn’t even have shut the buses off,” deadpans Northwestern’s head coach, Pat Fitzgerald.<br />Last year was last year, but the wide assumption is that sometime late in Saturday’s first half, maybe earlier, we’ll look at another Wildcats-Buckeyes score and wonder why they bothered putting the whole thing on.</td>

This is it.”<br />Republicans currently have a 50-48 majority in next year’s Senate, meaning control of the chamber depends on the results of the two runoffs in Georgia on Jan. 5.

Less than 20 locally transmitted infections have been recorded since the start of November, with an overall total of more than 58,000 cases and 29 deaths to date.<br />Immunizing its small population will likely take about a year from now as vaccine manufacturers ramp up production, with only a limited supply available over the next few months and some logistical challenges yet to be ironed out. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech Monday, in which he announced the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine’s approval by the country’s health authority, that Singapore expects to have the vaccine doses it needs from various suppliers by the third quarter of 2021.<br />Singapore also has advance purchase agreements with U.S. company  Moderna Inc.  and Sinovac Biotech Ltd., a leading Covid-19 vaccine developer in China. Batches from the three companies will arrive over the next year and Mr. Lee urged Singaporeans to take the vaccines, which will be free.<br />As in most places that have declared their vaccine plans, first priority will be given to health-care workers and vulnerable groups in terms of age and health, before the shots are rolled out to the broader population, officials said. “The more of us are vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a society,” Mr. Lee said.</td>

Months later, the 28-year-old was found dead on the side of a highway, bearing cigarette burns, broken teeth and fractured bones.<br />Italian prosecutors last week pressed charges against four members of Egypt’s security forces over Mr. Regeni’s abduction, torture and death as they laid out the most detailed case to date against the government of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, for whom it has become a source of severe international embarrassment.<br />It was the first full judicial investigation into Egyptian security services’ alleged use of secret detention, an abuse that human-rights groups say thousands of Egyptians have suffered. Police and security officers rarely face charges in Egypt over torture and deaths in custody, creating what rights groups say is a climate of impunity.<br />“This is going to be an inspection of this machine that commits disappearances and torture, highlighting how it functions,” said Mohamed Lotfy, director of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, a nongovernmental rights group that represents the Regeni family in Egypt. “They didn’t invent a new machine for Giulio. They used the tools and practices that they used on so many Egyptians,” Mr. Lotfy said.<br />What emerges from witness testimony, phone records and other evidence is a story of betrayal, deception and brutality, and offers a rare look inside the workings of Egypt’s vast security state. This account of Mr. Regeni’s fate is based on interviews, prosecutor statements and court documents.</td>

But keeping that competition healthy, and not pernicious, is vitally important. Relentless, debilitating competition where the two governments seek to curtail all trade, investment and technology flows will make that nearly impossible.<br />We must reject the notion that we don’t benefit from an economic relationship with China. It is not unpatriotic to say this. Indeed, our workers and farmers have the potential to benefit to a much greater extent from a more balanced relationship with the world’s fastest-growing major economy. As the two largest global economies, it is in the interest of Americans, Chinese and the world that the U.S. and China find a way to reboot economic growth.<br />Many people believe there will be a military crisis between the U.S. and China, and with good reason. But our military and diplomatic strength is rooted in a strong economy. And the path to economic success begins at home. Mr. Biden must crush Covid-19 and fix our economy to bolster economic competitiveness. If we do this, the U.S. will be a dominant world power no matter what China does.<br />While much more remains to be done, China has taken some steps in the right direction. The phase-one trade deal reached at the start of 2020 addressed immediate issues such as intellectual-property rights and market opening in some sectors. China also pledged to open additional service sectors and reform state-owned enterprises. Its plan to promote domestic consumption to re-energize the economy will provide export opportunities for U.S. firms. But implementation is the big test.</td>

We’ve got to move beyond that,” said Leigh Kelson, program director at FireTech Connect in Australia, a government-funded effort to help startups develop new firefighting technologies. Firefighters also rely on the equivalent of 911 calls to find new blazes.</td>

The vast majority of its borrowers—consumers and businesses—are in good standing.<br />“We’re all pretty surprised by the resiliency,” said Mr. Benson, chief executive at Rosedale Federal. “It’s not time for a victory lap yet, but we’re cautiously optimistic.”<br />As 2020 draws to a close, small lenders like Rosedale are doing far better than expected at the outset of the coronavirus recession—largely thanks to government money that passed through banks on the way to households and businesses. Stimulus and unemployment checks boosted deposits and kept borrowers from falling behind on their loans. The Paycheck Protection Program—the government’s small-business bailout—brought them new customers and kept old ones afloat.<br />Profit at community banks—small, local lenders—jumped 10% in the third quarter from the same time last year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Total loans rose 13.4% in the third quarter, compared with 4.9% for the industry. Deposits surged 16.7%. Noncurrent loan rates have risen slightly this year but are still far below levels seen during the last financial crisis.</td>

More than 100 House Republicans signed a brief in support of the lawsuit, which was Mr. Trump’s latest attempt to overturn election results and came after dozens of other failed efforts to overturn Mr. Biden’s win.<br />Some of the other Republicans who haven’t publicly acknowledged Mr. Biden’s victory have said the legal process should continue and that any voting problems should be investigated. However, Attorney General William Barr has said the Justice Department hasn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud. “There will be a president sworn in on Jan. 20, but let’s let this legal process play itself out,” Rep.

      <td>A softer touch is likely, but Democrats and Republicans share concerns about the threat to core American industries and China’s techno-authoritarian ambitions</td>
      <td>The tech war between the U.S. and China will likely continue under the Biden administration, although modestly sweeter talk may mask some of the deep bitterness.<br />The Huawei saga—centering on U.S. accusations of sanctions-dodging, industrial espionage and potential security threats—has been a centerpiece of the U.S.-China rivalry in the past couple of years. The Trump administration has restricted the Chinese telecom equipment company’s access to chips made using U.S. technology. And U.S. dominance in semiconductor equipment and design tools means it is now essentially impossible for Huawei to source chips. The U.S. has also put export controls on  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. , China’s homegrown alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest chip foundry by market share.<br />Such flexing of U.S. tech supremacy has laid bare China’s vulnerabilities in semiconductors, and the country has responded by redoubling its resolve to achieve self-sufficiency in chip-making. It has already devoted billions of dollars to the semiconductor industry and is recruiting top engineers from other countries. China was the world’s largest market for semiconductor equipment in the third quarter with sales of $5.62 billion, a rise of 63% from a year earlier, according to industry association SEMI.<br />The tensions over technology likely won’t go away under the new administration. The Trump administration’s blunt approach succeeded in kneecapping Huawei, with even non-American companies forced to comply with its broad restrictions. In the long run, however, such a strategy could weaken the U.S. High-tech companies eyeing the Chinese market may rethink sourcing from the U.S., or doing research or having operations there.<br />A targeted approach with American allies such as Taiwan and South Korea, both leading semiconductor manufacturers, with the narrower aim of keeping the most advanced technology out of China’s hands may be preferred by the new administration. Devoting more resources to shore up the research and manufacturing capabilities of the U.S. and its allies could make it even harder for China to catch up. Supporting chip-making at home is also consistent with President-elect Joe Biden’s pledge to boost domestic manufacturing.</td>

      <td>Sales of ready meals are growing faster than dinner boxes, even before a vaccine rollout likely cuts the time consumers spend cooking from scratch</td>
      <td>Meal kits were in demand this year as consumers spent more time cooking at home. When the Covid-19 vaccine rollout gradually allows normal life to resume, speedier dinner options like ready meals could eat into their growth.  HelloFresh ,  at least, has taken note.<br />The largest U.S. meal-kit provider last week raised its full-year sales and profit guidance for the fourth time in 2020, lifting its stock to new highs. Berlin-based HelloFresh also laid out plans to more than double its revenue to €10 billion, equivalent to around $12 billion, by the middle of the decade. The shares have gained 220% this year, making it the second-best performing name in the Stoxx Europe 600 index.<br />However, management expects sales to slow in 2021 from their projected 110% surge in 2020. Consumers are likely to spend less time cooking dinner from scratch and return to restaurants once the virus is under control. Ready meals that are sold directly to consumers through online subscriptions look poised to take share from meal kits as lives become busier. Sales of fresh dinners that can be heated in the microwave already grew faster than meal kits in the U.S. this year—by more than 100% compared with 60%, respectively—according to credit-card data analytics firm  Envestnet Yodlee.<br />Blue Apron is less prepared for the shift than its bigger rival. As its meager 7% share-price gain this year suggests, the U.S. company struggled to meet higher demand for its products during the pandemic. HelloFresh will try to protect its business by expanding into different meals such as lunch and new products. It recently bought Factor75, a business that will generate $100 million this year from freshly prepared meals.<br />The direct-to-consumer ready-meal market is small in the U.S. today and is valued at less than $1 billion. But it is growing quickly. Competition from American supermarkets may be less intense than in categories like frozen: U.S. grocers haven’t figured out how to transport fresh meals over the long distances required to reach nationwide stores within their short shelf life.</td>

      <td>Drastic changes caused by the pandemic have created a totally different job landscape in 2020, affecting productivity, diversity, mental health and more</td>
      <td>We worked from our kitchen tables, or donned masks to do our jobs. Our vocabulary changed: We learned what PPE was, and that some roles were essential. Protests, the racial justice movement and a historic election shook the country. We felt stressed, lonely; we lost our jobs or had to leave them.<br />It’s been a wild year that’s transformed work. To try to capture the breadth of what’s changed, and understand where we might be heading, I turned to the numbers: surveys, economic data and research papers.<br />They tell the story of women dropping out of the workforce in droves, companies catalyzed—at least on the surface—by the death of George Floyd, and a country where a quarter of households have had someone laid off. They point to a future where those who don’t have to don’t go into an office, at least not every day. Here’s our year at work, by the numbers.<br />We’re getting our work done, but we feel pretty miserable. In a September survey of 330 human resources leaders by the Conference Board, 47% of respondents reported an increase in productivity at their companies, while only 13% reported a drop. But 60% said their employees are working more hours and 63% said their employees are spending more time in meetings. Four out of 10 reported more mental health problems among workers.<br />Part of it is surely the work itself—we’re exhausted from back-to-back video calls, without even a commute as buffer between work and life. We’re scared of losing our livelihoods. And then there’s the health crisis: 78% of participants in an American Psychological Association survey of 3,409 adults said the pandemic was a significant source of stress, so it’s no surprise that’s bleeding into our work lives.</td>

      <td>LONDON—John le Carré, the spy-turned-novelist whose elegant and intricate narratives defined the Cold War espionage thriller and brought acclaim to a genre critics had once ignored, has died. He was 89.<br />Mr. le Carré’s literary agency, Curtis Brown, said Sunday that he died in Cornwall, southwest England, on Saturday after a short illness. The death wasn’t related to Covid-19.<br />In such classics as “The Spy Who Came In from the Cold,” “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” and “The Honourable Schoolboy,” Mr. Le Carré combined terse, but lyrical, prose with the kind of complexity expected in literary fiction. His books grappled with betrayal, moral compromise and the psychological toll of a secret life. In the quiet, watchful spymaster George Smiley, he created one of 20th-century fiction’s iconic characters—a decent man at the heart of a web of deceit.<br />For Mr. le Carré, the world of espionage was a “metaphor for the human condition.”<br />Born David Cornwell, Mr. le Carré worked for Britain’s intelligence service before turning his experience into fiction.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Multiple federal government agencies, including the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments, have had some of their computer systems breached as part of a widespread cyber espionage campaign linked to a foreign government, according to officials and people familiar with the matter.<br />Russia’s foreign intelligence service is suspected of being behind the hacks of the U.S. government networks—in which some internal communications are believed to have been stolen—and the operation is believed to be related to a cyber breach disclosed last week of U.S.-based cybersecurity firm  FireEye ,  one of the people familiar with the matter said.<br />The person added that several government agencies in total have likely been compromised.<br />The Commerce Department in a statement confirmed that one of its bureaus had been breached and that it was working with federal partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to probe the matter, but declined to comment further. The hack of Commerce systems includes the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a unit that works on technology policy issues, the person familiar with the matter said.<br />The apparent scope of the hacking operation and the suspected Russian involvement has alarmed national security officials in the Trump administration as well as executives at FireEye, some of whom view it as more significant than a routine foreign cyber espionage, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

      <td>Its strategists promote an identity politics campaign against an op-ed on Jill Biden’s use of ‘Dr.’</td>
      <td>Joe Biden says it is “time to heal” America’s divisions after the Trump presidency, and The Wall Street Journal has praised him for saying so. Presumably he intends less rancor with the press as part of this mandate, but on that score my run-in with the Biden team this weekend was very Trumpian.<br />The catalyst was our Saturday op-ed by Joseph Epstein, “Is There a Doctor in the White House? Not if You Need an M.D.” Mr. Epstein, a longtime contributor, criticized the habit of people with Ph.D.s or other doctorates calling themselves “Dr.” as highfalutin, using Jill Biden as Exhibit A. Mr. Epstein can be acerbic, and his piece began: “Madame First Lady—Mrs. Biden—Jill—kiddo: a bit of advice on what may seem like a small but I think is a not unimportant matter. Any chance you might drop the ‘Dr.’ before your name?”<br />This has triggered a flood of media and  Twitter  criticism, including demands that I retract the piece, apologize personally to Mrs. Biden, ban Mr. Epstein for all time, and resign and think upon my sins. The complaints began as a trickle but became a torrent after the Biden media team elevated Mr. Epstein’s work in what was clearly a political strategy.<br />Mrs. Biden’s press spokesperson, Michael LaRosa, issued a tweet in early afternoon: “@jamestaranto, you and the @WSJ should be embarrassed to print the disgusting and sexist attack on @DrBiden running on the @WSJopinion page. If you had any respect for women at all you would remove this repugnant display of chauvinism from your paper and apologize to her.” James Taranto is the Journal’s op-ed editor, but I am responsible for the opinion pages.<br />Elizabeth Alexander, the soon-to-be first lady’s communications director, also chimed in: “Sexist and shameful. Be better @wsj.” Ms. Alexander called me after her tweet to register her disapproval personally, which is fine. Her job is to flack for her boss, and part of my job is to listen to complaints. We had a frank exchange of views, as the diplomats say, and I invited her to send in a letter for publication.</td>

      <td>Reagan’s secretary of state also worked to restore balance to the American relationship with China.</td>
      <td>Helping to forge the relationship between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev made George Shultz—who turned 100 on Sunday—one of the most consequential secretaries of state of the 20th century. His expert diplomacy led to a peaceful end of the Cold War, bringing freedom to some 400 million Soviet subjects—something that seemed an impossible dream when Reagan took office in 1981. But the triumph of the Reagan-Shultz working relationship went beyond management of the Soviet challenge. The two men helped initiate a democratic wave that swept through Asia and Latin America in the 1980s and ’90s.<br />Working directly for Mr. Shultz on Asia in the 1980s, I saw how he and Reagan righted a U.S.-China relationship that had become unbalanced. A progression of American officials had forgotten that Beijing needed us far more than we needed them to deal with the Soviets. “I am not here to play cards. I am here to build our bilateral relationship” based on our mutual interests, Mr. Shultz announced during his first visit to China in February 1983. His statement conveyed to China’s leaders that he valued the relationship for the benefits it could bring to our two countries, not because of Chinese hints that they might move closer to the Soviets.<br />Mr. Shultz also restored balance to the U.S.-China relationship by demonstrating through words and deeds that U.S. allies—particularly Japan—came first, and that he would prefer no deal to a bad one. An incident during that same visit demonstrated his readiness to walk away if pushed too far. At a large luncheon with American businessmen in Beijing, Mr. Shultz’s temper slowly rose as his hosts pressed him with the official Chinese position on issue after issue. Finally, someone asked why American companies weren’t allowed to sell nuclear reactors to China while their European competitors faced no such restrictions. Mr. Shultz replied calmly, and with decided coolness, that the limits were necessary because of “legitimate concern about nuclear proliferation. Your question suggests in rather cavalier fashion that you brush it off. I don’t brush it off.”<br />Then he walked out, commenting as we left that Chinese intelligence services would report all the pressure he was under from American businessmen. Unspoken was the thought that they would also have to report: George Shultz has steel in his backbone.<br />A few months ago on these pages Mr. Shultz reflected on how Xi Jinping is turning the clock back to the Maoist economic model while “wrecking Hong Kong” and in the process losing “international trust.” He acknowledged with some obvious pain that “today’s China is different from the one I once worked with constructively.”</td>

      <td>A stockpile of medications from Regeneron and Eli Lilly to prepare in case vaccines aren’t enough.</td>
      <td>The U.S. can buy a Covid insurance policy for next year. The federal government should scale up production of antibody drugs to make as many doses as possible. The Food and Drug Administration has cleared two such drugs, from Regeneron and  Eli Lilly ,  for emergency use. For newly diagnosed patients, they reduce the risk of severe disease.<br />Making them is relatively straightforward, but supply is limited because the government didn’t find enough manufacturing space in the spring. Regeneron and Lilly took extraordinary steps to increase their own production. They knew they had to make these drugs in the U.S., lest other nations try to nationalize production and pocket the medicines. Each company freed up much of its domestic manufacturing capacity by shifting production of other drugs to places like Europe. Each company also joined forces with another large manufacturer to secure additional production capacity— Amgen  teamed up with Eli Lilly, and Roche worked with Regeneron. The federal government relaxed certain rules to enable these collaborations. This will produce a combined supply of six million to seven million doses next year.<br />But that isn’t enough. Most biotech companies prepare for disruptions in manufacturing by freezing and stockpiling enough of their most profitable drugs to last about two years. Why not pay these plants to use their capacity for antibody production? Companies can dip into reserves to avoid creating a shortage of other important medicines.<br />A manufacturer can’t flip to making antibodies overnight. It’d take about six months to convert a facility to the Covid drug and another six months to return it to its original purpose. But a big facility that makes the Covid antibodies at full throttle for about eight months could rack up some 2.5 million doses.<br />The government can help backstop the risks to any manufacturer willing to become a contract manufacturer for the Covid medication. The government can agree to buy the antibody and stockpile it at a price that makes it worthwhile. Regeneron and Lilly would be paid to license their drugs for such an arrangement.</td>

      <td>It’s been a season of federal lawsuits. There have been multiple actions by the Trump campaign and his allies to contest the election results. Google and  Facebook  are the subject of Justice Department antitrust actions. If you follow this stuff, you might be interested in reading the court records themselves—but it’ll cost you. Ten cents a page, according to the federal judiciary, even if you read them online.<br />That’s crazy. These are public records sitting in the public domain, and the judiciary is the only branch of the federal government that charges for online access. The latest White House press briefing will run you precisely zero dollars. Food and Drug Administration reports? Congressional roll call votes? All free.<br />The law authorizing judicial fees is a relic of a time before the internet, when accessing court records meant physically going to the courthouse and asking a clerk to copy them page by page. It should have been repealed decades ago when the records went online.<br />Last week the House passed the Open Courts Act, a bipartisan bill that would eliminate access fees and align the judiciary with the rest of the federal government. The Senate should follow suit and the president should sign this into law. Sadly, the chances of it happening soon are slim.<br />The benefits of making public records free are obvious. A core function of government is to assemble and disseminate information for the benefit of the public. The federal government, for all its shortcomings, is astonishingly good at this. Just ask the thousands of analysts on Wall Street who use Securities and Exchange Commission filings to price securities accurately. Or the legions of lawyers, journalists, scholars and members of the public who use federal records to anticipate and study new regulations, craft legal strategies for businesses big and small, and hold the government accountable.</td>

      <td>Beitar Jerusalem fans once shouted, ‘Death to the Arabs!’ Now one owns half the team.</td>
      <td>On Monday a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Nahyan, bought a 50% stake in an Israeli soccer team, Beitar Jerusalem, for $92 million. “Go Beitar!” the sheikh said. Actually, that’s a translation from—well, which language? The chant, using an Arabic word long incorporated into Hebrew, is “Yalla Beitar, yalla!”<br />Regrettably, that isn’t the only chant used by the team’s fans in the Israeli capital. Sometime in the 1990s I took my nephew to a Beitar soccer game at Teddy, its stadium named after Teddy Kollek, Jerusalem’s legendary mayor (1965-93). The chant “Death to the Arabs” started in the stands as soon as the game began. This was before Israeli television did documentaries on a Beitar fan group of hooligans calling itself “La Familia,” so it was completely new, and shocking, to me.<br />By then I was living in New York and following the Yankees more closely than any Israeli team, so I asked my nephew, a soccer maven, if the opposing team, Hapoel Haifa, had any Arab players. Nope. The chant was directed at no particular person. More like: Arabs are bad, so anyone playing against us is an Arab, and therefore death-worthy.<br />Beitar fans didn’t invent soccer hooliganism. Tottenham, a North London team identified with the Jews, has long been subject to anti-Semitic chants. Anti-Muslim and anti-African chants are sung at stadiums across Europe. Violence often ensues. Yet in Israel, where almost anything can be made into a referendum on political and national character, Beitar fans came to symbolize the worst in right-wing behavior.<br />Like all Israeli sports teams, Beitar Jerusalem has its origin in politics. Before Israel’s creation in 1948, athletic teams from major cities were party-affiliated. Maccabi represented the urban political center; Hapoel (“the worker”), the socialist Zionists; and Beitar, the “revisionist” right-wing faction from which Israel’s current ruling party, Likud, was born.</td>

      <td>The human brain did not evolve for thinking. Its main purpose is to regulate our physical resources and ensure our survival.</td>
      <td>Are you doing something rash and unwise? Blame your “lizard brain.” Our reptilian instincts, which date from when we were all cold-blooded creatures around 300 million years ago, supposedly guide all of our primal urges, from throwing a punch to having an affair. Scientists have long posited that time and evolution stratified the human brain, with the oldest and crudest lizard layer lurking at the bottom, followed by the mammalian limbic system, which controls emotion, and topped by the uniquely human neocortex, which guides rational thought. This theory not only suggests that humans are the most evolved creatures, given our deluxe add-ons, but also explains the tug of war between our animal impulses and logical ambitions—an inner struggle Plato observed more than 2,000 years ago.<br />But according to Lisa Feldman Barrett, a professor at Northeastern University, the idea that the human brain developed a way to rein in our inner lizard is one of the most persistent and widespread errors in all of science.<br />In her slim but potent “Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain,” Ms. Barrett eagerly dispels this and other myths about the gray matter between our ears. She writes that the notion that the human brain has three discrete layers emerged in the mid-20th century, when the best technology available was a microscope. Based on visual inspection, the human brain does indeed look like it has parts that are not in the brains of other animals. But when scientists began examining the molecular makeup of brain cells in the 1990s, they discovered that neurons from various animal species may look different but often have the same genes, suggesting they share an evolutionary origin.<br />More dramatically, Ms. Barrett writes that scientists have recently discovered that the brains of all mammals—and most likely all vertebrates—follow a single manufacturing plan. This means every brain has the same essential ingredients but with species-specific mutations to aid survival in different environments. This, argues Ms. Barrett, undermines the idea that the human brain stands apart as the pinnacle of natural selection. Sure, our brain seems impressive, but we are simply one animal among many with a noodle adapted to the task of survival. “Other animals are not inferior to humans,” Ms. Barrett writes. “Your brain is not more evolved than a rat or lizard brain, just differently evolved.”<br />Ms. Barrett is not afraid of picking arguments. In her 2017 book “How Emotions Are Made,” she used research from her lab and others to contest decades of conventional wisdom about emotions. (Her basic argument is that emotions are not innate, universal experiences, but cultural concepts rooted in nuanced physical sensations that may differ from person to person.) With this book, she compellingly explains that much of what we thought we knew about the brain is wrong.</td>

President Trump’s legal challenges have run their course, and he and the rest of the Republican Party can help the country and themselves by acknowledging the result and moving on.<br />Mr. Trump’s last legal gasp came Friday evening when the Supreme Court declined to hear the Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn the election results in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. As we predicted, the Court cited Texas’s lack of legal standing to challenge how another state manages its elections.<br />Some on the right claim that Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented, but this is wrong. The Justices said they would have taken the Texas case as a “bill of complaint” when states sue other states.<br />This is a technical point that concerns the Court’s case management, and the two Justices have a long-time view that the Court should hear more of these direct state appeals. We happen to agree, but in this case the Texas claim was outside constitutional bounds. Justice Alito (joined by Justice Thomas) added that he would “not grant other relief.” This was not a dissent on the merits of the Texas claim.<br />Mr. Trump and his camp are attacking the Court, and the President is deriding the “standing” point as a dodge. It is much more than that. Limits on standing are fundamental to a conservative understanding of the proper judicial role under Article III of the Constitution. If anyone can sue without a cognizable injury and the possibility of remedy, the courts would be overwhelmed with frivolous claims.</td>

Seattle’s mayor says in a video that she had to choose between spending “the next year campaigning to keep this job” or focusing “all my energy on doing the job.” More likely, Ms. Durkan realized that if she ran, she’d probably lose.<br />The mayor will go down in history for allowing protesters to create a police-free Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) in her city. She famously went on CNN to herald the event as a “summer of love.” Occupiers took over a police precinct inside the zone but Ms. Durkan did nothing. Violence followed—and now continues, with Seattle already having 55 murders this year, nearly double the number for 2019.<br />It says something about Seattle’s progressives that their answer to rising crime has been to cut the police budget by 18%, which the mayor signed last week. They wanted to cut it by 50%, which helped push the city’s first African-American police chief, Carmen Best, to resign. Mayor Durkan fought the activists and drove the cuts down to 18%, which in Seattle makes her a moderate. At one point the CHAZ protestors marched to the mayor’s home to show their dissatisfaction.<br />With her announcement, the political landscape has opened up. But the progressive reality of Seattle means that the next mayor will more than likely be to her left. Get ready for more love and anarchy.</td>

      <td>Progressives often caricature the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a special legal protection for intolerant Christians. But the Supreme Court delivered another refutation of that distortion last week, ruling unanimously that three Muslim men can sue federal agents under RFRA for alleged unfair treatment by the FBI.<br />The men say they were put on the no-fly list as retaliation after they refused to act as informants inside Muslim communities. Under RFRA, a federal law passed in 1993 and signed by President Clinton, if the government unlawfully burdens religious exercise, Americans may sue to “obtain appropriate relief.”<br />Although the Muslim men were eventually taken off the no-fly list, they also sued assorted federal agents for damages. The lead plaintiff, Muhammad Tanvir, told a lower court that he was forced to “quit his job as a truck driver, in part because he was unable to fly back to New York after completing long-distance, one-way deliveries.” The restriction also “prevented him from visiting his sick mother in Pakistan.”<br />But does RFRA even allow plaintiffs to sue government officials in their personal capacities like this, and for monetary damages? A district judge said no, dismissing the claims. But the Supreme Court now says yes in its 8-0 ruling in Tanzin v. Tanvir, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett not taking part. “A ‘government,’ under RFRA, extends beyond the term’s plain meaning to include officials,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the Court.<br />He added: “A damages remedy is not just ‘appropriate’ relief as viewed through the lens of suits against Government employees. It is also the only form of relief that can remedy some RFRA violations.” As an example, Justice Thomas cited the Muslim men’s “wasted plane tickets.”</td>

Then they intercepted him again.<br />But the problem for the Dolphins was that football games don’t last one quarter. They have four quarters. And since Mahomes entered the NFL, nobody has really stopped him for four quarters.<br />Mahomes finished with 393 passing yards and two touchdowns. There was also a Tyreek Hill run for a touchdown, a Mecole Hardman punt return for a score and a safety by the defense. By the time the game was over, the Chiefs had turned a 10-0 deficit into a 30-10 lead that ended in a 33-27 win against a playoff-caliber team. Mahomes finished with more interceptions (three), than he had previously thrown all season (two), and they still won with ease.<br />It was a remarkable display of what has defined the Kansas City offense ever since Mahomes took over. Opponents can force incompletions, sack him and even intercept him. They can’t contain him for an entire game.<br />The swift turnaround was oddly familiar to anyone who remembered Mahomes’s last game in Miami. That was in a game called the Super Bowl—when Mahomes also rallied from 10 points down to win.</td>

      <td>For much of the past decade, the San Francisco Bay Area has strained to absorb the torrid growth of the tech sector. As head counts of highly paid engineers swelled, housing costs soared, traffic gridlock rose and homeless tents spread on city streets.<br />Now a small-but-prominent roster of tech companies and investors are doing something about it: leaving.<br />The region’s latest emigrant is database giant  Oracle Corp. , a fixture of Silicon Valley for decades that last year signed a 20-year deal to put its name on the San Francisco Giants’ stadium, Oracle Park. The $180 billion tech giant on Friday said it had changed its headquarters location to Austin from Redwood City, Calif.<br />Oracle provided few details, saying it is implementing more flexible remote-work policies but wouldn’t move staff. It follows an announcement earlier this month by  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. , another business-technology company with deep roots in Silicon Valley, that it is moving its headquarters to Houston—as well as similar moves by a number of well-known venture capitalists announced in recent months. Elon Musk, who had long lived in Los Angeles and commuted to  Tesla Inc.’s  operations near San Francisco, last week said he had moved to Texas. And he criticized the policies of the state as restrictive—echoing the arguments of many of those leaving the Bay Area.<br />These high-profile departures are causing some soul searching in Silicon Valley—taking some sheen off the area’s reputation as the unparalleled tech capital. While reasons vary, many moves appear to have been sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic that has reshaped notions of where and how we work, and companies, investors and employees are generally moving to places that are warmer, with lower taxes and cost of living.</td>

      <td>U.S. retail sales and the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting highlight this week’s economic news. Economists are also monitoring Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are working on a package to support economic growth.<br />MONDAY<br />The Bank of Japan’s tankan corporate sentiment survey is likely to show the diffusion index measuring sentiment among large manufacturers improved to minus 14 in three months to December from minus 27 in the previous survey as production and exports recovered along with the reopening of the global economy.<br />TUESDAY<br />China’s growth momentum likely remained strong in November, with economists expecting gauges of domestic consumption and investment to gain steam. Retail sales, fixed-asset investment and industrial output figures will all shed more light on the pace of the country’s rebound from a short but sharp downturn early in the year.</td>

      <td>Screen-based meetings demand patience and new break-the-ice protocols, but you can wear gym shorts</td>
      <td>Jeanavic Malaiba had her routine for campus career fairs down cold. As she approached each recruiter, she would offer a firm handshake and pull a copy of her resume from an embossed leather portfolio she had saved up for, in order to appear more professional at interviews. Then she’d take a deep breath and launch into a tight pitch about the engineering classes she was taking at California State University, Long Beach and her hopes for a career in the aerospace industry.<br />But this fall, Ms. Malaiba began attending career fairs virtually and tweaked her strategy: She’d break the ice with recruiters joking about how both she and they were struggling with the event’s software, then quickly provide her full contact information in case they were disconnected.<br />Along with college classes, commencements and club meetings, the pandemic has pushed campus career fairs online this year. Instead of walking table to table, charming recruiters and elbowing classmates out of the way, job- and internship-hunting college students now log into virtual events where they may struggle to make an impression.<br />A poll of more than 500 schools conducted earlier this fall by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that 85% had not conducted a virtual career fair in previous years but 80% planned one for this autumn. The same poll surveyed attendance in fairs that occurred earlier this season and found that 72% of the schools said fewer employers had participated compared with in-person events, while 81% of the schools reported fewer students as well.<br />Many students say they can wait hours to exchange chat messages with a recruiter, after dressing in business conservative on the chance the interaction might move to a videoconference. At a virtual career fair put on by her university, Ms. Malaiba says digital queues for some recruiters stretched on for four or five hours, longer than the fair itself. Students hoping to connect with specific employers had no option but to wait it out. “It was kind of confusing,” said Ms. Malaiba, who is 21. “In years past, you’d stand in line, you could see where you were in line, if you were next. We were kind of left in the dark, virtually.” Ms. Malaiba ultimately only spoke with one company. A representative of her school confirmed the career fair but declined to elaborate.</td>

      <td>A month after the election, CNN holds leads in key ratings categories; President Jeff Zucker made aware of investor interest in network</td>
      <td>CNN is riding a ratings high in the aftermath of the election. Whether the network boss who oversaw those gains will stick around is an open question.<br />CNN averaged more total-day viewers than Fox News since Election Day through Dec. 8, a 35 day span, the first time it has won such a long stretch in that category in 19 years. CNN also bested the competition over that period among viewers ages 25 to 54, a demographic advertisers target on news channels. Fox News has retained the No. 1 spot in total prime-time ratings.<br />As CNN tries to maintain momentum, network parent WarnerMedia, a unit of  AT&T Inc.,  is in talks with CNN President Jeff Zucker on whether to renew his contract, with those discussions expected to heat up in coming weeks, people close to the situation say. Mr. Zucker had signaled to associates internally that he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to stay on, and would weigh his options after the election.<br />The contract negotiations are happening at the same time that CNN has become a target of takeover interest in the private-equity world. Recently, Mr. Zucker was made aware of investor interest in taking the network private, according to people familiar with the matter. One scenario floated was a management buyout that would see Mr. Zucker lead the network under new ownership, some of the people said. Mr. Zucker has indicated that would-be suitors should contact AT&T.<br />WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar said at a recent company town hall that CNN wasn’t for sale. People close to Mr. Kilar say that he is hopeful Mr. Zucker will stay with the company.</td>

      <td>Joseph Epstein’s article comes across as a put-down, an attempt to diminish the achievements of a woman who is to be respected and admired.</td>
      <td>Joseph Epstein’s op-ed (“Is There a Doctor in the White House? Not if You Need an M.D.,” Dec. 12) reeks of sour grapes. He tells readers about all he has accomplished without any type of advanced degree, including that he was an educator for 30 years. So was I, and I admire Dr. Jill Biden for having obtained her Ed.D. She has a right to be proud of her personal achievements and use “Dr.” in front of her name. She is also a role model who was able to take on family responsibilities as well as advanced academic responsibilities. In this day and age, Mr. Epstein’s article comes across as a put-down, an attempt to diminish the achievements of a woman who is to be respected and admired.<br />Renee Fishman<br />Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.<br /><br />Most of Mr. Epstein’s complaints about higher education seem to lie with the silly practice of bestowing honorary doctorates, which is entirely beside the point. What Mr. Epstein does have to say about academics has far more to do with self-seriousness than the value of the research they are producing. If he takes issue with the quality of Dr. Biden’s dissertation, let him make that argument on the substance rather than belittling her field, dissertation topic and degree-granting institution.</td>

      <td>William McGurn is disturbed by “The Silence of Pope Francis” (Main Street, Dec. 8) with regard to China’s arrest of Jimmy Lai, Hong Kong’s most well-known Catholic layman and champion of democracy.<br />Pragmatism may account for Pope Francis rendering unto China some authority over the church that traditionally is rendered unto God, but his approach fits a pattern. It may be that you can take a pope out of Argentina, but you can’t take Argentina out of a pope. Argentina has been infatuated with populist politics, democratic socialism and social justice for a century. A serial defaulter, Argentina periodically blames greedy capitalist lenders for the nation’s borrowing addiction and informs them that they don’t deserve to be repaid in full.<br />China’s communism was never perceived as a serious threat to Argentina, but greedy capitalists in the West were. Supposedly they were sucking the lifeblood out of the country. In this view, social justice is more important than one Hong Kong media mogul thrown in jail for trying to preserve Western-style freedoms.<br />Chris Davis<br />Jacksonville, Fla.</td>

      <td>Sen. Joe Manchin said a bipartisan group spoke Saturday about their proposal, ‘and we’ll be on the call again this afternoon to finish things up.’</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A group of rank-and-file lawmakers made a last-minute push to craft a bipartisan coronavirus aid proposal, as leadership in both parties indicated they might drop the most contentious issues in the talks and pass a narrower bill.<br />The bipartisan set of lawmakers has in recent days struggled to finish crafting a $908 billion aid package, tripping up over disagreements on creating liability protections for businesses and other entities to help them guard against coronavirus-related suits. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) last week proposed dropping the protections if Democrats agreed to forego state and local aid that has drawn Republican objections.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) indicated Sunday that Democrats may be open to a bill without state and local aid, which they have long insisted on in talks with Republicans.<br />“We need to act,” he said on CNN. “If acting means we’re not going to get everything we want, we think state and local is important, and if we can get that, we want to get it. But we want to get aid out to the people who are really, really struggling and are at great risk.”<br />Staff for Senate GOP leadership have started reviewing elements of the bipartisan group’s proposal that have support from both parties, according to a person familiar with the talks. The bipartisan proposal would add $300 a week to state unemployment benefits for four months, providing $300 billion in aid to small businesses, and sending $35 billion for health-care providers.</td>

The Taliban said 13 civilians had been killed in an airstrike, while a spokesman for the provincial governor said seven civilians had died after the Taliban detonated explosives laden into a Humvee.<br />Col. Sonny Leggett, spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement that the U.S. had conducted a strike against the Taliban in support of Afghan forces in a different district, adding that the Taliban claim of civilian casualties was false.<br />A video filmed by a local resident in Arghandab, and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, showed the bodies of 11 people, including at least seven children.</td>
