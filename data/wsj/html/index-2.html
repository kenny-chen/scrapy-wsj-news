      <td>The space transportation company run by Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos reached another important steppingstone in its effort to become an established launcher of U.S. civilian and national-security payloads.<br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Wednesday named Blue Origin Federation LLC’s New Glenn rocket—a 310-foot reusable booster that isn’t expected to make its first flight until 2021—as one of its potential launch providers for scientific missions later in the decade.<br />The agency said no specific contracts had been awarded to Blue Origin, but the announcement for the first time makes the closely held company eligible for such NASA business. Under the arrangement, the company Mr. Bezos founded nearly two decades ago will be allowed to use New Glenn, roughly six stories taller than rival rockets, to compete for awards. Various NASA centers will be able to design spacecraft to take advantage of New Glenn’s power and other features, including its capability to transport larger payload volumes than other rockets.<br />In a statement, Blue Origin said: “We are proud to be in NASA’s launch services catalog and look forward to providing reliable launches” for NASA for years to come.<br />Other heavy-lift rockets already cleared to compete for NASA’s scientific launches include those operated by Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and a joint venture between  Boeing Co.  and  Lockheed Martin Corp.</td>

He told reporters Wednesday, “I don’t want to get ahead of the line but I want to make sure we demonstrate to the American people that it’s safe to take.”<br />Two Biden transition officials said Mr. Biden would receive the injection as soon as next week.

      <td>WASHINGTON— Luckin Coffee Inc.  has agreed to pay $180 million to settle regulatory claims that it cooked its books to make growth appear more robust and meet earnings targets.<br />The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the penalty on Wednesday, eight months after the Chinese company disclosed that some of its officers fabricated sales in 2019. Luckin neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s fraud claims, which were filed in Manhattan federal court. The settlement is subject to a federal judge’s approval.<br />Luckin intentionally faked more than $300 million in retail sales from April 2019 to January 2020 by using related parties to create fake sales transactions, the SEC said. The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Luckin sold vouchers redeemable for tens of millions of cups of coffee to companies that had ties to Luckin’s chairman and controlling shareholder, Charles Lu.<br />Luckin, once a highflying competitor to  Starbucks  Corp.  in China, went public on the  Nasdaq  Stock Market in 2019. Its disclosure of financial-reporting failures earlier this year caused its shares to plummet 75%. The debacle put a spotlight on U.S. regulators’ inability to inspect the audits of American-listed Chinese companies, a compliance gap that gained attention in Congress this year.<br />Mr. Lu stepped down from Luckin’s board in July, and the Nasdaq delisted Luckin’s shares on July 13. Luckin’s shares still trade over the counter.</td>

The date of the election and other terms have yet to be determined. A hearing about the vote is scheduled for Friday.<br />A majority of the workers would have to choose unionization for the employees to gain representation. The Alabama warehouse has about 1,500 full- and part-time employees, according to the union, although Amazon has said the total is higher.<br />Though many hurdles remain, labor experts say a successful campaign by workers could inspire similar efforts at other Amazon warehouses. The company has more than 800,000 U.S. employees, second only to  Walmart Inc .  in the country, as well as more than 760 facilities in its fulfillment network, according to logistics consultant MWPVL International.<br />An Amazon spokeswoman said the company didn’t believe “this group represents the majority of our employees’ views.

      <td>The central bank again revises its growth forecasts upward.</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continues to stump for more economic “stimulus,” yet on Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee mainly stood pat. Even more telling, the FOMC’s members again revised up their predictions for the economy this year and next.<br />The Fed itself was reportedly considering an increase in its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage securities, or at least extending the duration of its bond holdings to drive investors into riskier assets. The FOMC did neither. It said it will continue its current monthly rate of asset purchases of “at least” $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion of mortgage securities until there is “substantial” progress toward its targets of low unemployment and inflation above 2% for a sustained period.<br />This is highly accommodative policy, and we welcome the restraint not to go further. But why the mismatch between Fed words and deeds? Our guess is that it’s a mix of politics and economics. On the former, Mr. Powell wants to be in sync with the politicians who want to spend more money amid the pandemic. The chairman saluted that desire at his afternoon press conference by again exceeding his policy mandate to endorse whatever spending bill Congress comes up with.<br />Yet in their economic outlook, the Fed’s leaders again revised their forecasts in the direction of better growth and lower unemployment. The median projection of Fed governors and regional bank presidents for growth in all of 2020 improved to minus-2.4%, which is up from minus-3.7% in September, which was up from minus-6.5% in June. Their estimate for the jobless rate at the end of this year also fell to 6.7%, which is down from 7.6% in September, which was down from 9.3% in June.<br />The Fed’s economists clearly misjudged the economy’s resilience during the pandemic. Now Mr. Powell is predicting a rough few months as Covid-19 inspections spike. But the Fed also increased its median estimate for growth in 2021 to 4.2%, which is up from 4% in September. The sages are predicting that the jobless rate will fall to 5% in 2021, from 6.7% today.</td>

      <td>Checking Cobb County’s absentees to shore up public confidence.</td>
      <td>The two Senate runoffs in Georgia are scheduled for Jan. 5, but around 700,000 ballots have already been cast. Enthusiasm is high, and no wonder, since what’s at stake is control of the Senate, Joe Biden’s legislative agenda, and the nation’s direction for two years.<br />The GOP will have big problems if sizable numbers of Trump supporters in Georgia decide they don’t trust the state’s election system enough to participate. President Trump has attacked Georgia’s voting process in his attempt to contest Joe Biden’s victory. So maybe this could shore up the public’s faith: Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Monday launched an audit of recent absentee signatures in Cobb County.<br />“Now that the signature matching has been attacked again and again, with no evidence,” Mr. Raffensperger said, “I feel we need to take steps to restore confidence in our elections.” That’s a reference to Mr. Trump and his allies, who have sought to cast a cloud over the state’s rules for verifying absentee signatures.<br />A Trump lawsuit in state court contends that Georgia’s overall rejection rate for mail votes in November was 0.34%, a steep drop from 2.9% in 2016. This shows, the filing argues, that signatures weren’t properly checked. Not necessarily: Georgia officials say the rejection rate specifically due to signature problems was 0.15%, closely matching 2018. What apparently plummeted was the share of ballots thrown out for other reasons, including lateness.<br />This year’s expansion of the mail franchise included steps to ensure that voters cast their ballots properly. Georgia approved ballot drop boxes for the first time, and there were more than 100 in the Atlanta area alone. A week before Nov. 3, Mr. Raffensperger urged people to think twice before putting a vote in the mail. A 2019 law simplified absentee ballots, while allowing Georgians to “cure” errors using a process that didn’t exist in 2016.</td>

      <td>For the first time in their lives, millions of Americans have been ordered by their government not to attend church. For millions of persecuted Christians across the globe, this is the only reality they know.<br />The theme of persecution lies at the heart of the Christmas story. The Holy Family were forced to flee their native land due to state-sponsored oppression. As citizens of a global superpower whose lawmakers are responsive to their citizens, we are called to stand in solidarity with persecuted Christians. The U.S. government has shown during this difficult year that it is responsive to such advocacy.<br />The House unanimously passed a resolution in November calling for continued humanitarian assistance to Christians, Yazidis and other communities that survived the ISIS genocide in Iraq and Syria. Also last month, the State Department and the Polish government hosted the third annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, an international forum for governments and civil society.<br />At the same time, 2020 has presented unprecedented challenges for persecuted Christians world-wide.<br />In Nigeria, according to Gregory Stanton of Genocide Watch, more than 27,000 Christians have died since 2009 at the hands of Fulani militants, Boko Haram and other Islamic militias—exceeding the number of ISIS casualties in Iraq and Syria.</td>

      <td>The new president should stop dwelling on the election, even if the old one won’t.</td>
      <td>As Monday’s Electoral College meetings in state capitals conclusively settled the race for the White House, Joseph R. Biden Jr. will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20. The outcome has been apparent for weeks, as one Trump campaign lawsuit after another flamed out. Now even prominent Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are acknowledging Mr. Biden will be America’s 46th president.<br />As one person moves into the Oval Office, another moves out—and so Donald Trump will exit 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, presumably to refinance his business, deal with investigations by the Manhattan district attorney and New York attorney general and keep his options open for 2024.<br />During this process, Mr. Biden has mostly struck grace notes. Despite provocations, he’s resisted inflammatory rhetoric and endeavored to turn down the temperature of our politics. Until Monday. The president-elect’s tone that night was a mistake.<br />In his televised remarks accepting the Electoral College results, Mr. Biden angrily denounced Mr. Trump’s efforts to flip the election. He called them “extreme” and “unprecedented” and accused Mr. Trump of having “refused to respect . . . the rule of law” or to “honor our Constitution.” He lectured Mr. Trump about “respecting the will of the people” even if he found those results “hard to accept.”<br />These points have some validity. The efforts of the Trump legal team were often indefensible. Team Trump’s rhetoric was frequently over the top and backed with scant evidence. But this wasn’t the time to make that point. The inevitable result is that the attacks drew the headlines, not Mr. Biden’s declaration that “we can work together for the good of the nation,” not his call for the country “to unite, to heal,” and not his promise to “be a president for all Americans.”</td>

      <td>German planes were spotted high above. What followed may have been the most intense aerial attack on a single ship during all of World War II.</td>
      <td>On Jan. 24, 1944, the destroyer USS Plunkett found herself offshore Anzio, Italy, supporting the embattled Allied beachhead there. The ship had had an eventful year, participating in the invasions of North Africa and Sicily. Like all destroyers, Plunkett was fast and well-armed for her size. She had many roles, including shepherding other ships and patrolling, but destruction was her natural job. On this day in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the men aboard were disappointed that some much-anticipated shelling of German positions ashore had been canceled.<br />At around 5:15 p.m., the ship’s doctor spotted a couple of German bombers, Dorniers, in the early-evening sky, fairly high up. The Anzio roadstead was thick with Allied ships, but the Germans owned the skies. “Looks like a little business coming up,” said the doctor almost to himself. “I think I’ll go down to the wardroom.” As James Sullivan tells us in his stirring “Unsinkable: Five Men and the Indomitable Run of the USS Plunkett,” the destroyer’s wardroom—the officers’ mess, at sea—did double duty in battle, serving as the dressing station for the wounded and dying. It would prove to be a busy place that evening.<br />Soon after calling his crew to battle stations, Plunkett’s captain, Ed Burke—one of the five men that Mr. Sullivan follows from the 1940s through the ends of their lives—could see the glide-bombs from the far-off Dorniers floating his way. What followed over the next 25 minutes may have been the most intense aerial attack on a single ship of any navy in World War II.<br />Soon the Dorniers were joined by dive bombers shrieking in, while torpedo planes came in “low and slow” to drop their sinister payloads that barely moved faster through the water than Plunkett herself. Capt. Burke successfully zigged toward the glide bombs, zagged to run parallel to a torpedo, dodged dive bombs that were landing as close to 20 yards away, and through it all, whenever he could, put the ship broadside on to the planes so his guns would have a chance. Eventually Plunkett was ablaze, but her guns kept firing with coordination and accuracy until the Luftwaffe had to call off the attack. Plunkett’s “bag” that day was impossible to verify, but it likely represented a quarter or more of the force that attacked her. The ship’s casualty list would include, apart from the scores of wounded, 29 men forever “missing in action.” These numbered more than the dead whose bodies could be identified. Plunkett managed to limp back to Palermo, saw action in Normandy on D-Day and ended her war in the Pacific.<br />Plunkett’s fate and what she achieved in those few minutes of Mediterranean gloaming were utterly tragic and utterly heroic. And yet the action was a drop in the ocean of that war. Sicily had been the largest seaborne invasion of anywhere ever, and Normandy 11 months later would dwarf it. Leyte Gulf, in the Pacific Theater, was the biggest naval battle of all time, and the opposing navies rarely saw each other: Planes did the attacking, as with Plunkett at Anzio, but on a titanic scale.</td>

      <td>The World Trade Organization will decide on Thursday whether to approve an Indian and South African proposal that would allow countries to disregard intellectual-property protections on Covid vaccines and therapeutics. Proponents claim the move would increase patients’ access to vaccines, especially in the developing world, by enabling companies to mass-manufacture generic copies of those drugs. In reality, suspending intellectual-property rights would make things much worse. The proposal is cynical—designed to benefit India’s and South Africa’s domestic drug industries at the expense of patients around the world.<br />India is the world’s largest manufacturer of generic drugs, and South Africa is another big producer. They lament that the U.S. and Europe have blocked intellectual-property rights suspension, even though a greater number of WTO member countries are in favor.<br />I’ve heard this line of attack before, and it is fraught with danger.<br />From 2010-15, I ran the international patent system for the World Intellectual Property Organization, a United Nations agency in Geneva. WIPO administers the global systems for patent, copyright and trademark protection, and its member countries include all those in the WTO. I helped conduct meetings designed to improve intellectual-property laws around the world and thereby create incentives for private innovation that benefits people world-wide.<br />At those meetings, India consistently questioned the need for patent laws, repeatedly pointing to the failure of pharmaceutical companies to recognize and respond to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. Indian delegates harped on this outdated criticism, even though manufacturers have made AIDS medicines available in developing countries at a fraction of their domestic prices.</td>

      <td>The Sierra Club hijacks a state agency in an effort to force Californians to use electric stoves and ovens.</td>
      <td>Californians pay twice as much for electricity as Nevadans and Oregonians do. In return they get rolling blackouts during heat waves and power cutoffs in windstorms to prevent fires caused by old equipment. So where’s the Public Utilities Commission’s Public Advocates Office? Its statutory mandate is “to obtain the lowest possible rate for service consistent with reliable and safe service levels.” Instead it’s busy trying to banish fossil fuels.<br />The office has teamed up with the Sierra Club against Southern California Gas. The Sierra Club has been pushing cities and the state Energy Commission to ban natural-gas hookups in new buildings. Some three dozen cities have done so.<br />SoCalGas is fighting these bans, as are homebuilders, realtors and commercial real-estate groups, which noted in a public comment to the Energy Commission that “in a survey conducted just two years ago, over 70% of the respondents indicated they would NOT want a home with an electric stove.”<br />Replacing natural gas appliances with electric ones is expensive. In the Central Valley, new-home buyers would pay $250 more a year to operate an all-electric home—and that’s before a planned 30% increase in electric rates over the next few years. The move to electric appliances would also increase demand for current, necessitating more blackouts. More than 120 localities have passed resolutions against gas bans.<br />Enter the Public Advocates Office. It accuses SoCalGas of illegally spending ratepayer dollars on political advocacy. The office has asked the utility commission to fine the company $379 million. SoCalGas says shareholders have financed its political lobbying. It acknowledges having spent some ratepayer dollars on public education, which is permitted. The distinction between public education and political advocacy can be fuzzy. Electric utilities are allowed to spend ratepayer dollars to promote electric vehicles.</td>

The complaint raises the prospect of a first U.S. trial related to the incident. Among the Americans who died were 35 students from Syracuse University in New York. The 32nd anniversary of the attack is on Monday.<br />The bombing led U.S. lawmakers to brand Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism and eventually forced the Libyan government in 2003 to pay more than $1 billion as recompense to the families of the victims.<br />The case, filed by prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, D.C., is based largely on a confession that Mr. Masud gave to Libyan authorities in 2012, which was turned over to Scottish authorities in 2017, as well as travel and immigration records of Mr. Masud, U.S. officials said.</td>

Roku is the leading streaming app distributor in the U.S., with some 46 million active accounts and 38% of the market including set-top devices and software that powers smart TVs.<br />Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on the terms of the deal.<br />WarnerMedia has said its full slate of films for 2021 will be launched the same way as “Wonder Woman,” with availability on HBO Max in the U.S. alongside the theatrical release. The company hopes that such premium programming will generate a wave of subscriptions for the streaming service, which is battling  Netflix Inc.,   Walt Disney Co. ’s Disney+,  Comcast Corp.’s  Peacock, and several other services.</td>

      <td>Central bank pledges to keep up asset purchases, giving investors less reason to worry about high stock prices</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve added a bit more support to the economy Wednesday, which should keep stocks and asset prices high. And if the economy weakens further, more support could be on its way.<br />Following their two-day meeting, Fed officials released a policy statement that was virtually unchanged from November’s meeting, except for one crucial difference. While at that meeting they continued their pledge to keep buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage bonds “over coming months,” on Wednesday they said they would sustain those asset purchases “until substantial further progress” has been made toward their goals of full employment and 2% inflation.<br />That suggests the Fed will be buying assets for a long time. Projections released alongside Wednesday’s statement show that officials’ median projection for the unemployment rate over the long run—essentially, their assessment of where it would be under full employment—is 4.1%. They don’t expect it to reach that level until some time in 2023. They don’t think that inflation will reach 2% until 2023, either.<br />Coupled with the Fed’s earlier promise to keep its target range on overnight rates near zero until it sees evidence of a tight labor market and inflation has obviously cleared its 2% target rate, Wednesday’s announcement suggests both short- and long-term rates will remain low for some time. That means Treasurys might not offer much competition for stocks in the years ahead, making it easier for many equity investors to stomach high valuations.<br />How much support the Fed’s pledges give to the economy, as opposed to asset prices, is an open question, given that the root of the economy’s current difficulties is the pandemic rather than any problem in lending markets. Still, if the alternative is doing nothing, the Fed’s inclination is to do more.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the National Collegiate Athletic Association violated federal antitrust law by maintaining tight limits on compensating college athletes, a case that could determine the future shape of college sports.<br />The court, in a brief written order Wednesday, said it would hear the NCAA’s appeal of lower court rulings that found the association unlawfully limited competition for college athletes by restricting the kinds of compensation they could receive related to their education.<br />Those rulings cleared the way for college athletes to receive an expanded range of education-related benefits, such as laptop computers or musical instruments, study-abroad programs, internships and paid-for graduate school. The rulings didn’t lift NCAA limits on athlete compensation unrelated to education.<br />The Supreme Court is stepping into a legal and political fight that has subsequently expanded dramatically and is now not just about athlete compensation, but also control of the multibillion-dollar college-sports industry.<br />In the years since former West Virginia University running back Shawne Alston and other former Division I athletes filed their suit, states have brought unprecedented pressure on the NCAA to allow direct compensation to athletes for the use of their names, images or likenesses. In response, the NCAA tore up its decadeslong definition of amateurism and conceded that it will allow some endorsement money to flow to college athletes starting in the 2021-2022 school year.</td>

      <td>New York City Ballet and Pacific Northwest Ballet offer filmed productions of George Balanchine’s staging of Tchaikovsky’s Christmas classic.</td>
      <td>Two films of “George Balanchine’s ‘The Nutcracker,’” one made by Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle and the other by New York City Ballet, began streaming on Friday. But for the current pandemic, these troupes would be performing the work, live, for most of December in front of their theaters’ audiences.<br />The films, which require a ticket purchase for online viewing, are just two signs of the long coast-to-coast fame of Balanchine’s ballet. First given by NYCB in 1954, the two-act work to Tchaikovsky’s 1892 score set a standard that has made this Christmas-themed ballet a sought-after holiday event. The NYCB film was shot in 2019 for use in an upcoming Disney+ documentary series about the School of American Ballet and documents the production Balanchine himself revamped in 1964 and oversaw until his death in 1983. PNB’s was first performed in 2015 and was filmed in 2018 for archival purposes, its tweaks in design and production framing the scrupulously staged Balanchine choreography.<br />Unlike numerous “Nutcracker” stagings by other choreographers in which adults play the story’s youngsters, the Balanchine work confidently uses real children to artfully enact the narrative’s characters at its homey Christmas gathering—one that magically evolves into a story about an enchanted Nutcracker and an ensuing battle between toy soldiers and aggressive mice, before concluding in a fairy kingdom. More than 60 students from their respective ballet schools are involved in each production filmed here; the age range is 9 through 13 in Seattle and 8 through 13 in New York.<br />As caught in this filming, PNB’s visual style suggests a Currier and Ives print; NYCB’s filmed result resembles a sepia-toned tintype photograph. Wide shots allow viewers to appreciate the productions’ full-stage dimensions to the maximum and both movies feature occasional, judicious close-ups.<br />Both films were shot in HD, though PNB’s is clearer and crisper, with James F. Ingalls’s high-contrast lighting making for wondrous changes to both the interior and exterior scenes. Ian Falconer’s striking, New England-inspired settings, amplified by some animated film moments, and his hard-edge costuming ably support the choreography.</td>

      <td>NEW YORK—Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged a Kenyan man with plotting to stage an attack in the style of Sept. 11 at the direction of al-Shabaab, a terrorist group that serves as al Qaeda’s principal wing in East Africa.<br />Cholo Abdi Abdullah, 30 years old, traveled to the Philippines in 2016 to train as a pilot and researched how to hijack an aircraft in preparation for crashing a commercial aircraft into a building in the U.S., Manhattan federal prosecutors said. They said he acted at the direction of an unidentified senior al-Shabaab commander who was also responsible for planning a 2019 attack at a Nairobi hotel.<br />“This chilling callback to the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, is a stark reminder that terrorist groups like al Shabaab remain committed to killing U.S. citizens and attacking the United States,” acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement.<br />Prosecutors charged Mr. Abdullah with providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, conspiring to murder U.S. nationals, conspiring to commit aircraft piracy and other crimes. He faces up to life in prison.<br />Mr. Abdullah was arrested in the Philippines on local charges in July 2019 and transferred to U.S. law enforcement Tuesday.</td>

      <td>Most of the blowback from Joseph Epstein’s op-ed “Is There a Doctor in the White House? Not if You Need an M.D.” (Dec. 12) is coming from those who imagine it had to do with Jill Biden’s being a woman. That’s wrong.<br />I taught at a university whose president, a former football coach who held a degree in physical education, wrote a book titled “Nobody Calls Me Doctor.” Bud Davis was an amiable fellow, willing to laugh about his degree.<br />There are degrees, however, that mean something. Readers of Boswell’s “Life of Johnson” will recall that Samuel Johnson had to leave Oxford early after the death of his father and became Dr. Johnson only after he had completed his great “Dictionary of the English Language.” The Oxford doctorate he was then awarded may be described as honorary but entirely real.<br />The issue raised by Mr. Epstein has nothing to do with women as such. It has to do with a certain tremulous American hypocrisy about what constitutes genuine accomplishment. The point of his article was simply that not everyone in Kentucky addressed as “colonel” was ever actually in the military.<br />Em. Prof. William C. Dowling</td>

Mr. Becerra will ensure that all of these are put into play as part of a “build back better” government-run health-care agenda.<br />The experiment in California has led to higher taxes, fewer health-insurance options and more expensive products and services.

The successful return of a lunar landing craft to Earth is the world’s first since a Soviet mission in 1976.<br />China Central Television coverage showed the craft intact and nestled in the snowy ground and being approached by helicopters. It took some time after it touched down for ground crews to locate the roughly 3-foot-wide capsule in the dark and state media cited challenges in getting vehicles across the flat expanse to retrieve it.<br />China’s complicated Chang’e 5 mission began on Nov. 24. The space vehicle included orbiter, lander and ascender with maneuvers that included reuniting spacecraft 200 miles from the lunar surface for a transfer of captured moon material before firing off for a return to Earth.<br />The Chang’e 5 probe, China’s third exploration on the moon’s surface, had spent 19 hours on the surface and used robotic equipment to drill about 2 feet deep to recover around 4.4 pounds of rock and material. “These samples will be studied to uncover clues to the moon’s multi-billion-year history,” according to a report by CCTV, the state broadcaster.</td>

      <td>KANKARA, Nigeria—The sand-coated courtyard at this all-boys boarding school, once the setting for soccer games and awards ceremonies, has in recent days become a grim assembly point for parents of more than 300 boys kidnapped in Nigeria’s largest-ever mass-school abduction.<br />Dozens of grieving families have gathered here, gaunt and drawn from lack of sleep, since their sons were abducted by gunmen on Friday night and driven into the dense forest beyond the school’s pastel-colored classrooms. The families have come to demand answers on how Boko Haram, the jihadist group that has claimed responsibility for the attack, could have ventured so far from its strongholds into this remote corner of northwest Nigeria and seized hundreds of their children.<br />“How could this have happened?” said Suwaiba Lawan, whose 15-year-old son is among the missing. “He loved it here, and always helps with chores around the home.” Another mother, Jamila Salisu, said she had barely slept or eaten since her own son, from the same class, had disappeared: “The government must negotiate,” she said through tears. “Give the terrorists whatever they want so I can see my son again.”<br />Six years after the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in the town of Chibok ignited the global #BringBackOurGirls campaign, the cries of schoolchildren’s parents are again echoing across Africa’s most-populous nation. Nigerian senators, celebrities and opposition leaders have reacted with horror to the announcement by the Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau—the man responsible for the Chibok abduction—that he also carried out this operation. Thousands are spreading the word on social media with a new hashtag: #BringBackOurBoys.<br />“This is shaping up to be another huge moment in the history of Nigeria’s insurgency,” said Jacob Zenn, a specialist on Boko Haram at the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation think tank. “After Chibok, Shekau not only knows how to conduct mass kidnapping operations, but also how to hide the captives and then get mass media attention and leverage it to negotiate.”</td>

      <td>While still off-limits to most international tourists, Kyoto in many ways feels remarkably unchanged, writes Pico Iyer of his adopted home</td>
      <td>IT’S HARD to believe that, in April, some of Kyoto’s aromatic tourist streets were empty. A few nights ago, hundreds of people were lined up outside Kōdai-ji, in Kyoto, to walk around the temple’s annual autumn “Light-Up.” The following morning, in my neighborhood, kids were scuffling to school and my elderly friends at the gym were preparing for hours of furious Ping-Pong. It could be any December, really—depthless blue skies above russet and gold leaves—as I step into my local bus and realize there’s barely any room for me to stand.<br />A Martian touching down in Kyoto tomorrow might never guess that we’re in the throes of a global health crisis. Yes, the Land of the Bow reflexively practices social distancing at the best of times, and maybe one person in three every winter wears a mask (to protect others from sneezes and coughs). My neighbors are so used to hardship and obedience that no one registers any impatience as another long line of sightseers forms outside the Kyoto temple called Kurodani and each has her temperature scanned by a high-tech screen, is asked to buy a paper bag for carrying around her shoes (reusable plastic might carry infection) and sprays her hands with sanitizer before disappearing into a maple-filled garden.<br />Even this spring, when the pandemic first closed many places down, domestic tourists were thronging the tree-lined walks along Kyoto’s Philosopher’s Path, marveling at the cherry blossoms. In April, my 88-year-old mother was released from a hospital back in California, and I had to fly over to take care of her. Now, after more than six months away, I’m back in my adopted home of 33 years, just in time for fall’s brilliant festivals of goodbye.<br />Some things certainly look different these days, though Japan’s constant changes on the surface don’t often mean much change at its core. I returned to find the supermarket next to our apartment swathed in scaffolding. Our nearest big train station had been expanded so dramatically I could no longer orient myself. Our favorite Californian cafe here was gone. But people in Japan have long specialized in putting a bright face on things—in public at least—if only because 20 typhoons sweep through every year and the ground is often shaking with previews of the next earthquake.<br />So what strikes me most is what hasn’t changed. My first morning back, I saw a woman showing off a huge radish she’d just picked up from a neighbor’s barn, after leaving the equivalent of a dollar in a wooden box. The trees along the lanes were bright with tangerines and persimmons. Crows were perched among the apple-colored leaves, waiting to pounce on garbage bags left out in the street for collection. A man at our local shrine, first constructed in 1552, was joining his hands in silent prayer, though the worn rope used to ring a bell to summon the gods was tethered, in deference to the virus. When I traveled into central Nara, I saw some of the 1,200 or so “god’s messenger” deer who rule its downtown trooping across a busy road at a pedestrian crossing while a stag and his newborn stood silent guard outside the five-story glass-and-concrete City Hall.</td>

But congressional leaders were expected to add direct checks, and Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R., S.D.) told reporters Wednesday he expected the checks would be in the $600 to $700 range per person. That is less than the checks of $1,200 per person in the initial round earlier this year.<br />That earlier round of direct payments was estimated to cost $292 billion through 2021, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.<br />They are likely to be left out of this deal, after proving to be a sticking point in talks. Mr. Thune indicated that Democrats pushed to include the direct checks in exchange for dropping aid for state and local governments.</td>

      <td>The Atlanta clergyman often sounds more like a transnational leftist than an American politician.</td>
      <td>The Middle East poses a problem for the Democrats. Theirs was traditionally the pro-Israel party and still commands the support of a substantial majority of Jewish voters. But left-liberal orthodoxy demands that all right-thinking people take the side of the Palestinians against the Israeli government and hold Jerusalem to a double standard: If any other nation takes an aggressive stance against terrorist insurrectionists or other internal threats, the results may be tragic but are kept in perspective. If Israel does so, it has committed a moral outrage and broken international law.<br />If you aspire to higher office as a Democrat, you’re expected to sympathize with that view of things but not to adopt it too stridently. You can condemn Israel for measures it has adopted to counter the indiscriminate killing of its civilians by terrorists, but you have to couch it all in pro-Israel rhetoric, always emphasizing Israel’s “right to defend itself,” as if any country could reasonably be said to lack that right.<br />Most Democratic candidates have negotiated the problem reasonably well, although extreme anti-Israel outliers from safe districts, such as Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, can occasion some awkwardness for their congressional colleagues. The problem for Raphael Warnock, the Democratic Senate candidate in Georgia’s special-election runoff Jan. 5, is that he didn’t start trying to negotiate it until very recently. He is a pastor whose weekly sermons at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta are recorded and available online, and he is the sort of left-wing clergyman who likes to make political pronouncements and to sign high-minded political statements.<br />He signed one such statement, composed in 2019 under the auspices of the National Council of Churches, after visiting Israel and the Palestinian territories with a group of black American and South African clergymen. The statement compared Israel’s border wall to the Berlin Wall and drew indirect but invidious analogies to apartheid, slavery and Nazism. The statement also included melodramatic language about the plight of Palestinians (“we are cut up by the misery in which poor families in Palestine have to survive”) and showed no awareness that these conditions are a consequence of Palestinians’ refusal to reject, and indeed insistence on using, murder as a political tool.<br />Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s campaign has underscored this and similar statements as evidence of Mr. Warnock’s radicalism. His response, in a written statement last month: “Claims that I believe Israel is an apartheid state are patently false—I do not believe that.”</td>

      <td>Ludwig van Beethoven was born 250 years ago and baptized Dec. 17, 1770. Even those who don’t care for classical music recognize the opening bars of his Fifth Symphony. “Ode to Joy” from his Ninth brings tears to the eyes of listeners when “flash mobs” perform it. I’m a huge Beethoven fan and have been fortunate to hear both symphonies in concert.<br />Beethoven was resilient, innovative and gritty. His prodigious creativity left an enduring mark.<br />Amid 21st-century technological progress, the evolution of the piano in the late 18th century may seem quaint. But Beethoven took full advantage of the wider frequency and amplitude ranges this new instrument provided. The fortepiano—Italian for “loud soft”—was a major improvement on the harpsichord. Because the piano uses hammers to strike strings, players for the first time could vary a note’s volume.<br />Beethoven’s life is almost as inspiring as his music. He had an abusive, alcoholic father, Johann Beethoven, who often dragged his son from bed at night to practice at the keyboard. He so wanted Ludwig to be a child prodigy that he claimed the 7-year-old boy was only 6 when he gave his first recital. Johann felt he was in competition with Leopold Mozart, father of Wolfgang.<br />Beethoven was remarkably productive: His complete works fill 80 compact discs. The maximum disc playback length is 74 minutes, just long enough to accommodate the Ninth Symphony.</td>

In Stockholm, hospitals have nearly twice as many Covid-19 patients as they do intensive-care beds, said Bjorn Eriksson, the city’s health and medical care director.<br />On Monday, the country’s statistics agency said Sweden recorded 8,088 deaths from all causes last month, the second-deadliest month for the country of 10 million in its modern history, eclipsed only by the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918.<br />The increase in deaths and hospitalizations has already forced Sweden to set aside a policy of using voluntary measures to contain the virus, a strategy that has drawn global interest. By contrast, most European countries have used lockdowns and mandatory restrictions to contain the virus this year.</td>

      <td>Underwhelming plans for dealing with a prospective surge in bad debts highlight the political challenges posed by the EU’s proposal</td>
      <td>“History shows us that it is best to tackle nonperforming loans early and decisively,” said European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, as he announced a plan for “bad banks” to sweep up debts soured by the pandemic.<br />But history also shows that Europe’s lenders aren’t likely to get much relief unless they actually find themselves in a nonperforming loan crisis.<br />The proposal announced by the European Union’s executive arm Wednesday supports creating national bad banks and a data hub for NPLs, while also pushing long-stalled proposals to harmonize debt recovery and insolvency rules. Officials are publicly acknowledging a key lesson from the 2008 crisis: Fast balance-sheet cleanup helped U.S. banks recover quickly, while European lenders struggled under a lingering hangover of bad loans.<br />But the plan stops far short of creating an EU-wide bad bank, as some had hoped.<br />The lack of ambition is lamentable but understandable. Commission proposals require signoff not just from the European parliament but also from Europe’s national leaders, who are often loath to approve anything that shares financial risk among them. The glacial pace of recent reform on the banking and capital market unions attests to the challenge. Unfortunately, that leaves Europe’s subscale banks struggling for profits among a patchwork of national and EU rules while competing with larger U.S. rivals.</td>

      <td>Disappointing retail sales report sets stage for a difficult winter, but new round of government support could ease the pain</td>
      <td>The Covid-19 crisis has caught back up with retailers again, setting the stage for a hard start to winter. But help may be on the way.<br />The Commerce Department on Wednesday reported that retail sales in November fell a seasonally adjusted 1.1% from the prior month, and adding to the insult revised its October sales level down as well. Typical holiday spending categories were among the worst hit, with sales down 3.5% at electronics and appliance stores, 6.8% at clothing and clothing accessories stores, and 7.7% at department stores. Sales at food services and drinking places fell 4%—an indication that the combination of colder weather crimping outdoor dining and stepped-up Covid-19 worries is hurting the restaurant sector.<br />The report suggests that the 4.1% annualized growth in fourth-quarter gross domestic product that economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast earlier this month may be too high. Moreover, because it also implies that the level of spending may be lower heading into the first quarter than many economists supposed, the average level of GDP in the first quarter may be lower relative to the fourth quarter than they forecast. As a result, their projection of 1.9% GDP growth in the first quarter also could be too high, with risk of an outright contraction that would send the economy into a double-dip recession.<br />Part of what makes the news disconcerting is that it comes during the holiday shopping season, which many small retailers in particular depend on. Fewer of them may be able to survive the winter, with negative repercussions for everything from commercial lending to the job market’s ability to recover.<br />Another worry is that apart from restaurants, the report reflects weakness in the goods sector, which is what has been driving the recovery since spring. As of October, consumer spending on goods was still 7.8% higher than in February, according to the Commerce Department, while spending in the far larger services sector was down 5.8%.</td>

      <td>Major League Baseball announced Wednesday that it was “correcting a longtime oversight in the game’s history” by elevating the Negro Leagues from 1920 through 1948 to major-league status, a move that recognizes the sport’s long-excluded Black pioneers and immediately rewrites baseball’s record books.<br />Roughly 3,400 Black and Latino players from seven distinct leagues, who were barred from joining the segregated National and American Leagues, will now be classified as “major-leaguers,” alongside white stars of the era. All statistics and records for those players will become part of MLB’s official history.<br />Before Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color barrier for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, the Negro Leagues were the highest level of professional baseball open to Black players. Those leagues produced players who are considered among the most talented ever to step onto a field, including Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige and Oscar Charleston.<br />“All of us who love baseball have long known that the Negro Leagues produced many of our game’s best players, innovations and triumphs against a backdrop of injustice,” MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said.<br />Bob Kendrick, the president the president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Mo., called the move “historical validation for those who had been shunned from the major leagues and had the foresight and courage to create their own league that helped change the game and our country, too.”</td>

      <td>Report says the two countries had intervened in foreign exchange markets in a persistent, one-sided manner to limit appreciations of their currencies</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Treasury Department labeled Switzerland and Vietnam as currency manipulators on Wednesday, saying the two countries had intervened in foreign-exchange markets in a persistent, one-sided manner to limit appreciations of their currencies.<br />“The Treasury Department has taken a strong step today to safeguard economic growth and opportunity for American workers and businesses,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. “Treasury will follow up on its findings with respect to Vietnam and Switzerland to work toward eliminating practices that create unfair advantages for foreign competitors.”<br />Mr. Mnuchin’s statement accompanied the Treasury’s foreign-exchange report, which addresses the currency practices and macroeconomic policies of major U.S. trading partners. The report, typically released twice a year, is the Treasury’s primary vehicle for officially designating countries as currency manipulators.<br />The Treasury said it determined that at least part of both countries’ foreign-exchange intervention over the past four years had aimed to prevent effective balance of payment adjustments. The agency said Vietnam had also sought to gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade through its exchange-rate management.<br />The Treasury Department uses three criteria to assess whether a country manipulates its exchange rate: the extent of active intervention in currency markets; the size of trade surpluses with the U.S.; and the size of the country’s current-account surplus, a broader measure of trade that includes investment income and other financial flows.</td>

Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R., S.D.) told reporters Wednesday he expected the checks would be in the $600 to $700 range per individual.<br />The package was also expected to include enhanced unemployment insurance, likely the $300 a week that a bipartisan group had proposed, Mr. Thune said. Congressional aides noted that the negotiations were continuing and no final agreement had been reached.<br />The overall cost of the package under discussion Wednesday was slightly under $900 billion, according to people familiar with the talks.</td>

      <td>Two Canadian cannabis companies have agreed to merge, creating what they said would be the largest cannabis operation globally by revenue and potentially signaling more deals ahead among cannabis firms.<br />Aphria Inc.  and  Tilray Inc.  said Wednesday their proposed combination would create a company with annual revenue on a pro-forma basis of Canadian $874 million, equivalent to $686 million. The combined company would control 17% of the adult-use Canadian cannabis market by revenue, according to Raymond James, roughly double the shares of three other competitors.<br />The federal government in Canada legalized recreational use of cannabis in 2018, generating investment for new companies that cultivate the substance and sell it under various brand names. Corona beer brewer  Constellation Brands Inc.,  for example, has invested in  Canopy Growth Corp.  Some U.S. states allow people to use cannabis for medicinal uses or as a recreational product.<br />Canadian cannabis companies have at times struggled to generate profits as they navigate what is a relatively new consumer marketplace for publicly traded businesses and regulations across different areas.  Aurora Cannabis Inc.  said Wednesday that it had closed a facility and cut production at another, moves meant to improve cash flows.<br />The deal between Aphria and Tilray could signal more mergers and acquisitions ahead across the industry, according to some analysts. “We expect to see a building wave of consolidation among large and small cannabis players alike,” analysts at Raymond James said.</td>

      <td>BRUSSELS—Negotiators moved closer to an agreement on the future relationship between the U.K. and European Union, officials from both sides said, though they remained far apart on a major stumbling block: access by EU boats to British waters.<br />With just over two weeks to reach and ratify a deal covering economic, trade and security arrangements, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told EU lawmakers it remains impossible to say with certainty whether an agreement is coming together.<br />Failure to reach a deal would mean from Jan. 1 tariffs would be applied for the first time in almost a half-century on some trade between the U.K. and the EU. The U.K. sends 43% of its exports to the bloc.<br />But in comments that echoed views of people involved in the negotiations, Mrs. von der Leyen checked off a series of issues where the two sides have narrowed or resolved differences linked to a central EU demand: that the U.K. commit to standards on issues such as state aid, labor and environmental regulation that will ensure fair competition once Britain leaves the bloc.<br />That includes progress on defining the rules around U.K. state-aid decisions and their enforcement, and the ability of the EU to take punitive action if the agreement is breached.</td>

Should you be loading up on debt to pour into stocks, property and other things that might produce a return above the cost of repaying the loan? One notable investor shows how getting everything right can deliver fat returns—but still come with a hefty drawback.<br />Britain’s Wellcome Trust stands out in 2020, as it was probably the foundation best prepared for a pandemic. It was a co-founder of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in 2017, and is run by an epidemiologist who warned in January that Covid-19 was much worse than everyone thought.<br />The £29 billion, or $39 billion, medical charity—Britain’s biggest foundation—piled on protection for 20% of its stock exposure using derivatives when the market was complacent about the danger, and has strongly outperformed global equities as a result.<br />This isn’t just a story about getting 2020 right, although Wellcome’s longstanding portfolio of growth stocks, including China’s Alibaba, Tencent and  JD.com ,  also did very well. Instead, this is about Wellcome’s decision back in 2018 to borrow at what was then the lowest rate ever for a corporate 100-year bond, to invest in (mostly) stocks.</td>

      <td>Come winter, both men and women encounter dry, parched skin. So we set out to uncover the most soothing, yet not sticky creams for all skin types and desires.</td>
      <td>WHEN THE weather turns cold, face cream becomes a skin care survival tool, an insulating layer that supplies moisture and prevents it from escaping. “The simple act of putting it on will make you look better,” said Boston dermatologist Ranella Hirsch of a rich cream’s immediate smoothing and plumping effects. Yet, the prospect of slathering on a robust formula often brings to mind the cold creams our grandmothers kept on their night tables—dense goop laden with mineral oil. That stuff, as Dr. Hirsch puts it, felt “repulsive” on the skin and mainly treated one type of skin: super dry.<br />Today, said Dr. Hirsch, we better understand the moisture barrier—the protective outermost layer of skin—and how to keep it resilient with more-sophisticated ingredients for every complexion type. Now you’ll find products whose labels list everything from weightless hyaluronic acids to non-greasy shea butters. But between the lotions, balms and gels, how do you find one that’s ultra-moisturizing but with a wearable, all-day texture? My solution was to test a bunch—50, to be exact. I have combination skin (dry cheeks, oily nose) and I’m a runner so my face frequently takes a beating from wind and snow, which can leave it chapped. I consider strong fragrance a major turnoff (though I appreciate subtle botanical whiffs). In my tests, I heeded Dr. Hirsch’s advice on how to apply creams properly (many of her patients don’t, she finds): To trap in moisture, she said, put it on damp skin, “ideally within a minute of washing your face.” (Also helpful: getting ambient moisture from a humidifier and giving up long, hot showers—I’m working on that).<br />Here, eight rich yet easily absorbed creams that exceeded my expectations and will get you through the depths of winter.<br />Once you try this intensely healing ointment, suitable for both face and body, you will never go back to the sticky alternatives. It absorbs incredibly easily into dry patches, without making you feel all lubed-up. from $8, vanicream.com.<br />Having SPF in your day cream means you don’t have to think about it—but you can spend considerable brainpower trying to find a mineral-based one that rubs in without chalky residue.

      <td>SUVs are getting too big—and too pricey. Kia’s sleeker midsize Sorento trims the fat without sacrificing the third-row seat, giving the middle class a break, says Dan Neil.</td>
      <td>THE 2021  Kia  Sorento is a midsize crossover with third-row seating. I find that utterly fascinating.<br />In the past I’ve complained about the spiraling size of SUVs and pickups, as auto makers and dealers push U.S. consumers into ever larger vehicles, because—at the risk of being reductive—they are more profitable. It would be easy for a small family to walk into a dealership and drive off with a full-size, three-row SUV, having blown their budget, convinced the third row will pay for itself in convenience over 72 months of car payments.<br />The emergence of midsize crossovers with third-row seats represents the counter trend in consumer preference: right-sizing. Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Mazda CX-9, Subaru Ascent, GMC Acadia, VW Atlas, Nissan Pathfinder. All now have third-row seating options, formerly the exclusive domain of L- and XL-sized vehicles. All are cheaper to buy, feed and maintain than the full-size brand alternative.<br />Example: Kia’s own Telluride SUV is 7.9 inches longer and about $2,600 more than the new Sorento. The Telluride is well priced and well reviewed, and has the option of seven or eight seats. But for buyers who foresee using these seats only sparingly, the midsize option may pencil out better, now that it’s here.<br />As was inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Know thyself, carbuyers. Those two or three extra seats could cost a lot, or a little. How often do you expect to have more than five people in your car; how old will they be; and how comfortable, for how long? Kids are bendy. I’ve owned a seven-passenger minivan for years. I can’t remember the last time every seat was filled. And yet car buyers are often consumed with fears of “What if?” Third-row seats, bike racks, multi-mode vehicle dynamics, launch control, paddle shifters, low-range 4x4, seat massagers, 300-mile EV range: just a few of the features people pay scads for and use rarely, if ever. Third-row seats are like gym memberships.</td>

StockX has now raised $490 million through private investors.<br />StockX Chief Executive Scott Cutler, a former executive at eBay Inc. and the New York Stock Exchange, said in an interview that the company was profitable for the first time in the third quarter, with revenue rising 75% year over year. He said the website averaged a record 25 million monthly visitors in the quarter, including 10 million over the Black Friday weekend. “I think that’s just representative of the growth in the business.”<br />The Detroit-based company started in 2016 as an online platform to buy and sell rare sneaker models, before expanding into streetwear, handbags, accessories and electronics. StockX emulates a stock exchange by providing market data for items, including the 52-week high and volatility. It generates revenue by keeping a percentage of each transaction.<br />StockX joins online companies, including  Wayfair Inc.  and  Etsy Inc.,  that have benefited from changes to shopping habits during the coronavirus pandemic.

      <td>With so much uncertainty, let’s embrace a policy agenda that is premised on curiosity</td>
      <td>As the debate over big tech and antitrust intensified over the past year, certainty reigned.<br />On one side are those who are certain that companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies, dominant in individual markets like search, social networking, e-commerce and app stores. They are certain that mergers between companies like Facebook and Instagram reduced competition. And they’re certain that antitrust law has calcified, unable to account for new technologies. As a recent report by the House Judiciary Committee claimed, “companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups…have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons.”<br />On the other side of the debate are those who are certain that competition is flourishing in the tech sector, with innovation yielding great products at ever-lower prices, and companies like TikTok and Snap emerging to challenge incumbents. They are certain that mergers have benefited consumers. And they’re certain that we don’t need to re-examine antitrust doctrine because it’s flexible enough to evolve with technology.<br />In the course of this debate, I’ve espoused my own certainties. When I worked for Facebook, it never felt like we could afford to be complacent. We faced real competitive threats. If I had shown up at a meeting and announced that Facebook didn’t compete with Google, Apple or TikTok, I would have been laughed out of the room. And I saw Facebook’s investment in developing new features for its Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions and improving the safety, security and infrastructure of both products. So it’s hard for me to reconcile my experience in the tech sector with the antitrust arguments now being waged against it.<br />But if November’s election taught us anything, it’s that our assumptions are often wrong. With polls predicting a blue-wave election that never materialized, predictions that seemed certain before the election now seem flimsy in the wake of it.</td>

      <td>Moves by high-profile companies to Texas from California are likely to improve the personal finances of executives and offer employees more affordable housing—but make little difference to the firms’ tax bills.<br />Oracle Corp.  and  Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co.  are the latest big corporations to announce moves to the Lone Star State. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc., is also moving to Texas, and the electric car company is expanding there.<br />The announcements have highlighted the vastly different tax and regulatory systems in the country’s two most populous states. California relies more on taxing personal income, particularly of high-income households, and operates a growing regulatory structure. Texas leans on more regressive property and sales taxes and boasts a more laissez-faire environment. The biggest difference: High-paid executives who move can see their state income-tax bills go from 13.3% to nothing.<br />But corporate investors hoping for big tax and other savings may need to temper their enthusiasm. Business-tax considerations are likely to prove secondary at best, tax and economic-development experts say. They are dwarfed by the allure of more-affordable housing, lower cost of living and lighter regulatory burdens.<br />For companies, much of the difference between California and Texas boils down to ease and cost of hiring—not just now but down the road.</td>

      <td>Mayor Anne Hidalgo appointed 11 women and five men to senior roles at city hall in 2018, and now has to pay a $110,000 fine</td>
      <td>The city government of Paris has been dealt an unlikely punishment: a fine of 90,000 euros, equivalent to $110,000, for appointing too many women to senior positions and breaking France’s gender-equality rules.<br />The offense dates back to 2018, when Mayor Anne Hidalgo appointed 11 women and five men to her senior team at a time when administrations around the world were trying to increase female representation in governments. But with 69% of the positions going to women and 31% to men, Paris broke national government rules to promote equality, which require that at least 40% of new positions should be allocated to each gender.<br />A waiver was introduced in 2019 if the new hires didn’t lead to a broader gender imbalance. That would seem to be the case for Paris, where women account for just under a half of senior officials in city hall. But the initial round of appointments predated the waiver, meaning the Paris government was still on the hook.<br />Ms. Hidalgo told a meeting of the city council on Tuesday that the appointments helped give women a louder voice in government in France and, with tongue in cheek, said she was delighted to pay the fine.<br />“In Paris, we are doing everything to make it a success, and I am very proud of a large team of women and men who together carry this fight for equality,” Ms. Hidalgo said.</td>

      <td>The European Union unveiled plans to assist countries in setting up a network of national “bad banks” to help cope with a possible avalanche of defaulted loans triggered by the pandemic.<br />Bad banks—private or government funded repositories that soak up soured loans—are seen as a way to help Europe’s creaky banks navigate the Covid-19 downturn and be strong enough to lend during the recovery. The European Central Bank, which supervises the largest banks in the eurozone, has warned banks could be facing $1.7 trillion in bad loans under an extreme, yet possible, economic scenario.<br />The proposal for the bad banks announced Wednesday by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, underscores its limits in trying to create EU-wide solutions that all member states can agree on. The effort would rely on individual governments to sponsor the bad banks, falling short of more ambitious proposals for a continentwide bad bank.<br />Banks in the south of Europe, such as Italy, Spain and Greece, tend to see a surge in loan defaults during economic downturns. The issue is less severe in richer northern European countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, which have blamed individual countries and their banks for their troubles.<br />Bad loans have been a big problem for the bloc since the sovereign-debt crisis in 2011, when banks choked on mountains of defaulted loans, hurting profits and their ability to lend. Banks were still cleaning up their balance sheets when the coronavirus pandemic hit.</td>

Robinhood exposed Massachusetts investors to “unnecessary trading risks” by “falling far short of the fiduciary standard” adopted this year that requires broker-dealers to act in their clients’ best interest, the state said.<br />A Robinhood spokeswoman said the company hadn’t seen the complaint but will continue to work closely with all regulators.<br />“Robinhood has opened up financial markets for a new generation of people who were previously excluded,” she said. “We are committed to operating with integrity, transparency, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”<br />The complaint from the office of William Galvin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, marks the latest round of scrutiny that the popular brokerage has faced in its short history. Since it was founded less than a decade ago, Robinhood has exploded in popularity, amassing more than 13 million customer accounts.

      <td>BERLIN—The German government on Wednesday moved to allow the use of Huawei’s technology in 5G mobile networks in exchange for assurances by the Chinese vendor about the safety of its gear, in a rebuke to the Trump administration.<br />The bill, which still requires parliamentary approval, marks a setback for the outgoing U.S. administration, which has long lobbied European allies to reject Huawei’s technology. The U.S. claims that Huawei gear is akin to a Trojan horse that once inside critical infrastructure in the West can be used by China to spy and steal sensitive information, posing a security and economic threat to the U.S. and its allies. The company denies those allegations.<br />In light of German industry’s dependence on China—the country is Germany’s largest trade partner and the biggest market for many German companies—Berlin has been reluctant to saddle up with Washington, instead seeking a middle ground that would allow Huawei to do business in Germany but with sufficient monitoring to appease its wary U.S. ally.<br />When the government published a draft of the bill earlier this month, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that the government sought to create a legal basis that would address network-security concerns but also keep the market open to competitive technologies.<br />“We’ve created regulation that allows us to monitor trustworthiness in an appropriate fashion. Our security interests played a big role,” Mr. Seehofer told the German business daily Handelsblatt.</td>

      <td>Retail sales in November are forecast to decline, ending six months of spending growth</td>
      <td>U.S. consumers have pulled back on purchases and limited holiday shopping in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic triggered new business restrictions, potentially snapping a six-month stretch of retail sales growth.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast that retail sales decreased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in November from a month earlier. The Commerce Department will release the November figures on Wednesday.<br />That would mark the first month-over-month decline since April in the department’s measure of spending at stores, vehicle dealerships, restaurants and online.<br />Expected weakness in automotive sales will likely contribute to the decline, along with “the fact that people are starting to stay at home again,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at consulting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. A rise in coronavirus infections is starting to affect sales at businesses such as restaurants, he added.<br />The U.S. economy continues to recover, but at a slower pace. Hiring growth slowed in November while worker filings for unemployment benefits recently increased. Overall consumer spending, which includes retail and services consumption, has continued to increase, but more slowly than over the summer. Consumer confidence has been mixed, with one survey reflecting a brighter outlook for the economy beyond the pandemic.</td>

The following day she woke up and felt fine.<br />Ms. Edwards, like the other 30,000 volunteers who took part in Phase 3 clinical trials for Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, wasn’t told whether she got the vaccine or a placebo. However, she said a trial researcher attributed her symptoms to her body mounting a strong immune response to what was most likely the vaccine. “It’s better having 36 hours of feeling really rough than getting Covid,” she said.<br />Moderna declined to comment for this article.<br />As the first vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  rolls out this week and the next one from Moderna looks poised to start reaching people soon, some Americans have expressed reservations about getting vaccinated. One concern has been possible side effects. While the data show that some Moderna and Pfizer trial volunteers experienced side effects, even those who had harsh reactions recommend the shots.</td>

Expectations for new legislation aimed at combating climate change under a Biden administration are likely to stoke demand for ESG funds over the coming years, and several asset managers are rushing to meet that demand.<br />Asset managers have launched 31 ESG-related ETFs so far this year, nearly double last year’s sum and bringing the total number of products in the U.S. to more than 100, according to Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research at FactSet.<br />BlackRock Inc.  has been among the most prolific, recently rolling out ETFs that are based on the S&P 500 and other indexes but exclude companies involved in the fossil-fuel, tobacco and weapons industries.

Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.3%.<br />Signs of progress toward a fresh fiscal-stimulus package buoyed sentiment on Tuesday, allowing the S&P 500 to break a four-day losing streak. Top congressional leaders signaled they were inching closer to striking a deal after a day of meetings. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he’s optimistic, fueling bets that lawmakers will craft the new aid package before the holidays and the expiration of several key aid provisions.<br />Hopes for the new stimulus package have become the latest catalyst for a market rally that has sent the S&P 500 index up over 14% this year, despite the economic setback triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.<br />“It is just another excuse for those that missed the rally, or that are bullish anyway to buy into it,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. “We know that [a deal is] coming, the signals are pretty clear,” he added.</td>

      <td>Real-estate developers provide much-needed economic activity and land purchases. A squeeze on their balance sheets by the government would have impacts on international markets.</td>
      <td>China’s real-estate developers contributed significantly to its recovery this year, revving up sales and construction activity as the world’s second-largest economy began to shrug off the economic effects of the pandemic.<br />But it isn’t clear whether they will be able to repeat the same act next year. Markets that are sensitive to the conditions in the sector, especially industrial metals like steel and copper, may begin to reflect that.<br />Late last month, China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission chief Guo Shuqing labeled real estate the country’s largest “gray rhino:” an obvious and highly dangerous threat that is tough to tackle.<br />Most listed real-estate developers breach at least one of three “red lines”—specific leverage ratios to avoid—which haven’t been officially announced, but which are repeatedly identified in state media. As of the end of the first half of 2020, only six major developers passed all three tests, according to  BNP Paribas .  Nine breached all three, among them Sunac and Evergrande, two of the country’s largest property firms.<br />In theory, where developers place on the redlines test will determine how much debt they can raise in the subsequent year. And without the ability to add leverage, their ability to buy the land required to finance local governments would be more limited. Analysts at Nomura expect land-sales revenue to rise by just 5% next year, down from 9% this year, the slowest increase in at least five years.</td>

With majority ownership of Finite, BP plans to take global the business of paying landowners not to cut down trees.<br />BP and Finite didn’t disclose financial terms of the latest deal but said that the forestry firm was now part of the energy company’s Launchpad. The unit functions similarly to a private-equity firm by taking big economic stakes in businesses with an eye toward steering them through expansion.<br />“Finite Carbon has the potential to build a global platform for managing and financing natural climate solutions,” said David Eyton, BP’s executive vice president of innovation and engineering.<br />BP itself has been one of the world’s biggest buyers of forest carbon-offset credits, a type of climate-change currency. The company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on offsets to comply with California regulators. They operate a so-called cap-and-trade system that aims to reduce greenhouse gasses by making it more expensive over time for companies operating in the state to pollute.</td>
