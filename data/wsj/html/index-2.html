      <td>Unless court expedites case, the appeal likely will be moot before it comes up for consideration by the justices</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Trump campaign said Tuesday it was asking the Supreme Court to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in Wisconsin, following a similar appeal it filed last week seeking to reverse the Democrat’s win in Pennsylvania.<br />The campaign asks the justices to declare the Wisconsin election “failed” and allow the Republican-controlled state legislature to appoint presidential electors in place of those pledged to Mr. Biden, who won Wisconsin by more than 20,000 votes.<br />But unless the high court grants the campaign’s request to expedite the case, the appeal likely will be moot before it comes up for consideration by the justices.<br />Under Supreme Court rules, the opposing party—in this case, Mr. Biden’s campaign—normally has 30 days after petitions are docketed to file a response, after which the justices schedule a discussion to consider whether to hear the appeal.<br />It is unclear when the appeal will be placed on the docket.</td>

Ms. Taylor was at home with her boyfriend when police raided her apartment. Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who later said he thought the officers were intruders, shot at them. Three officers, including Mr. Cosgrove, responded by firing more than 30 bullets. Ms. Taylor was shot and killed.<br />The department is accusing Mr. Jaynes of being dishonest in the search warrant application, said his lawyer Thomas Clay, who plans to fight the termination. “He did nothing wrong,” said Mr. Clay. “I scrutinized the search warrant affidavit.”<br />A lawyer for Mr. Cosgrove wouldn’t comment on the grounds for termination.</td>

      <td>If Pakistanis fail to keep suspect imprisoned, U.S. stands ready, acting attorney general says</td>
      <td>The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday raised the possibility that a man accused in the 2002 murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl could be brought to the U.S. and tried here after a Pakistani court earlier this month ordered him set free.<br />In April, a Pakistani court downgraded Omar Saeed Sheikh’s conviction on charges of murder, terrorism and ransom to a single kidnapping charge. Mr. Sheikh was originally sentenced to death and has been imprisoned for the past 18 years. The kidnapping charge carries a sentence of only seven years.<br />Pakistani authorities have been searching for a way to keep Mr. Sheikh detained—including appealing to the country’s Supreme Court to reinstate the conviction. Acting U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said Tuesday that if the authorities are unsuccessful, the U.S. was prepared to take the man into custody and pursue the case in the American court system.<br />“We remain grateful for the Pakistani government’s actions to appeal such rulings to ensure that he and his co-defendants are held accountable. If, however, those efforts do not succeed, the United States stands ready to take custody of Omar Sheikh to stand trial here. We cannot allow him to evade justice for his role in Daniel Pearl’s abduction and murder,” Mr. Rosen said.<br />The late Mr. Pearl was a veteran Wall Street Journal correspondent. While serving as the newspaper’s bureau chief for South Asia and reporting in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in January 2002, he was kidnapped and killed by Islamic extremists. At the time, Mr. Pearl was reporting for an article about religious extremists in Pakistan as part of the paper’s coverage in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S.</td>

The federal government has purchased the doses and is overseeing their distribution.<br />The company’s new policy would appear to allow the vaccination of some people who aren’t in the high-priority groups identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has said the first people who should receive the limited initial supply of available vaccine doses are health-care workers and residents of long-term-care facilities, followed later by people 75 years and older and certain essential workers such as police officers and manufacturing workers.<br />The CDC didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>

      <td>The feds seek billions in penalties for filling valid opioid prescriptions.</td>
      <td>One benefit of the Trump era has been the relative absence of dubious lawsuits against business. An exception is the Justice Department’s new suit against  Walmart  for filling opioid prescriptions.<br />The lawsuit in federal court in Delaware claims that Walmart “failed to detect and report at least hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders” and that as a pharmacy it “unlawfully filled thousands upon thousands of invalid controlled-substance prescriptions.” These actions enabled opioid abuse and “helped fuel a national crisis,” the feds say.<br />The complaint alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations, but it is really a 160-page exercise in scapegoating a company because it is well-known and has deep pockets. Walmart doesn’t push pills on opioid addicts. Its pharmacists fill valid prescriptions written by doctors who are licensed by their states and registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).<br />When Walmart’s pharmacists catch a prescription that appears fraudulent or forged, they are trained to refuse to fill it and document the incident. Walmart says it has passed tens of thousands of leads about suspicious prescriptions to state and federal law enforcement. It's the job of the DEA and state medical boards to investigate and revoke doctors’ licenses and prescribing privileges if there’s wrongdoing.<br />Yet the DEA rarely imposes such restrictions on physicians, and Walmart has no authority to act on its own. When pharmacists have refused to fill questionable prescriptions, doctors have sometimes sued for defamation and patients have sometimes sued for discrimination. Several states have prohibited pharmacists from interfering with the doctor-patient relationship by second-guessing valid prescriptions.</td>

      <td>A Chinese court Monday sentenced 37-year-old Zhang Zhan to four years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” but her real offense was telling the truth about the government’s early mishandling of Covid.<br />Ms. Zhang rushed to Wuhan in early 2020 to report on the coronavirus outbreak and the government’s response. She visited hospitals and crematoriums, interviewed terrified Wuhan locals, posted more than 120 video clips on YouTube, and shared her insights with foreign media. On  Twitter  she observed that “the party flags and red symbols at many neighborhood entrances all indicate that epidemic-prevention isn’t important. Protecting regime stability that has been impacted by the pandemic is the actual goal.”<br />Ms. Zhang’s reporting came as Beijing was trying to gaslight the world into believing it had responded to the outbreak competently and transparently. She knew the risks of contradicting the official narrative. She had reported on the disappearance of other journalists.<br />“Maybe I have a rebellious soul . . . I’m just documenting the truth. Why can’t I show the truth? I won’t stop what I’m doing because this country can’t go backwards,” Ms. Zhang said in one video clip obtained by the BBC.<br />In mid-May, Ms. Zhang went missing, and her friends learned she’d been arrested. Her lawyers say authorities have restrained and force-fed her after she went on a hunger strike. Zhang Keke, her attorney, has described how she recites passages from the Bible for comfort but “feels psychologically exhausted, like every day is a torment.” Ms. Zhang appeared in court Monday in a wheelchair, her lawyers said.</td>

The split-second decision to open fire on Tamir, based on the officers’ stated belief that the toy gun was a real threat, didn’t meet that burden, according to the department.<br />“Although Tamir Rice’s death is tragic, the evidence does not meet these substantial evidentiary requirements,” the Justice Department said.</td>

      <td>U.S. troops can’t be everywhere forever. But the Trump Administration hasn’t made a good case for its recently announced withdrawal from Somalia in Northeast Africa.<br />President Trump has often expressed his skepticism of American commitments abroad, but the Administration’s move on Somalia was relatively quiet. Mr. Trump ordered the military to “reposition the majority of personnel and assets out of Somalia by early 2021,” according to a Pentagon statement this month. “While a change in force posture, this action is not a change in U.S. policy,” the statement said. “The U.S. will retain the capability to conduct targeted counterterrorism operations in Somalia.”<br />Even if it can achieve some objectives from outside the country, it would be losing the influence that comes with the 700 U.S. troops in Somalia. Americans are still vulnerable in countries like neighboring Kenya, and the U.S. needs multiple outposts to fight active terrorist groups.<br />Since Islamic State lost its physical caliphate in Syria and Iraq, unstable parts of Africa have become more appealing for jihadists looking to claim territory and plot attacks on the West. ISIS has a small presence in Somalia but the greatest threat is al-Shabaab.<br />The U.S. has launched at least 50 airstrikes this year against the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab. Mr. Trump said in a June letter to congressional leaders that some U.S. forces in Somalia also “advise, assist, and accompany regional forces, including Somali and African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces, during counterterrorism operations.”</td>

Do you anticipate the end of Covid-19 having a similar effect?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Jan. 12. The best responses will be published that night.<br />A Tale of Two Pandemics<br />At the beginning of the pandemic, I was concerned that my elderly mother, a hairdresser, continued seeing clients at their homes despite San Francisco’s shelter-in-place orders. After all, we should have been performing our new American duty—staying at home. I pleaded with my mother to close her business, citing the grim data emphasizing increased mortality among elderly populations plastered on every front page. Reluctantly, she sheltered for a week, but soon the income loss became too much.<br />Untimely car and dental troubles depleted the savings we hoped to ration throughout the pandemic. Local and federal aid barely covered three months of living and business expenses. Every $20 haircut quickly became more valuable than our health. The irony was not lost: To survive the pandemic, we had to risk infection.<br />Meanwhile, a supposedly united America preened over its noble self-isolation—even celebrities shared the quarantine struggle, tweeting and streaming from their lavish homes. In actuality, the images populating social media were only half the story. The U.S. experience was divided: Those that possessed adequate financial capital could freely perform their civic duty while working-America compromised their safety for necessities. My low-income family was excluded from visions of a safe, socially distant society, sparking endless debates over stimulus packages that, if substantive, could allow us to shelter.</td>

Because it may take several days for transfers to clear, some banks aren’t likely to deposit the payments into customer accounts until next week.<br />Paper checks, which are sent to taxpayers who didn’t provide their bank-account information to the Internal Revenue Service in recent tax returns, will begin to be mailed out on Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin said.<br />President Trump on Dec. 27 signed into law a roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid package that will provide a second round of stimulus payments to households.<br />Households below certain income thresholds will get $600 per adult and $600 per child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round delivered earlier in the pandemic.

      <td>Presidents are often at the mercy of unpredictable factors like the business cycle—and pandemics.</td>
      <td>President Trump’s supporters tout the economy’s pre-pandemic performance as evidence that tax cuts and deregulation were making America great again. Detractors look at the data and find these policies wanting or outweighed by the harmful effects of Mr. Trump’s aggressive approach to trade and his isolationist approach to immigration.<br />Both views are misguided. A closer look at the data from the past four years exposes the folly of inferring anything about a presidential administration from how the economy performed. Consider these four lessons:<br />Lesson 1. Presidents often get credit or blame for the economy even though uncontrollable events often matter more than policy. Consider the data for Mr. Trump’s full term. Based on the latest forecasts, the economy will have grown since the beginning of 2017 at an annual rate of about 1.5%, the worst performance of any president since Herbert Hoover. Job growth has been even more dismal, at around three million jobs lost over the past four years.<br />These numbers are obviously meaningless in assessing Mr. Trump’s economic policies given a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. While one could debate the effect on the economy of the president’s mismanagement of the public-health crisis, no one would argue that the GDP and unemployment numbers are reflective of his regulatory reforms or immigration restrictions.<br />The same point applies to other years too, even if the magnitude and causes are not nearly as stark. For example, Mr. Trump’s supporters sometimes credit him with turning the economy around because growth increased from 1.7% in 2016 to 2.3% in 2017. But much of the change is explained by an increase in the pace of exports caused by the 0.7 percentage point pickup in the growth rate of America’s trading partners in 2017. Giving Mr. Trump credit for that “turnaround” makes about as much sense as blaming him for “ruining” the economy with his terrible four-year growth rate.</td>

      <td>Covid-19 worsened a shortage of coins. Capitalism is solving the problem.</td>
      <td>Making change used to be a bit of a joke. A memorable “Saturday Night Live” parody ad in 1988 imagined the “First CityWide Change Bank,” which gave its customers the denominations they want: “If you come to us with a $100 bill, we’re not going to give you 2,000 nickels—unless that meets your particular change needs.”<br />Nowadays getting the change you want is no laughing matter. In many cities making change has become a cash cow for some because of the great U.S. coin shortage. Covid has limited banks hours and shut down the retail businesses that often return coins to circulation. It doesn’t help that Americans have a tendency to dump coins in shoeboxes and never use them again, keeping many in-circulation quarters and pennies sequestered.<br />Nickel-and-diming isn’t going away, even in the digital age—though it’s quarters in particular that are in high demand. Americans still need coins at laundromats, to pump air in their tires at gas stations and for old fashioned parking meters. It’s costly to retrofit coin-operated machines.<br />Don’t panic. Washington is coming to the rescue with its usual turtlelike agility. Officials at the U.S. Mint concede that “sometimes coins are not readily available.” The Mint’s director, David J. Ryder, has asked consumers to “help get coins moving by using exact change when making purchases, taking your coins to financial institutions, or turning them in for cash at coin recycling kiosks.” He says that production of coins is rising now given the demands.<br />As usual, the free market is way ahead of the government. Customers at the Pennsylvania-based Wawa convenience-store chain can change their coins for bills and come away with a free coffee. For one week in July, the Community State Bank in Wisconsin gave a $5 bonus for every $100 worth of coins turned in. My son tells me that San Francisco even has an active secondary market of enterprising entrepreneurs hanging out and serving as, well, “change agents.” A couple of quarters go for as much as a dollar, a roll of 40 for $11 or $12.</td>

      <td>The Dalton School, an elite private prep school in New York’s Upper East Side, is experiencing something of a moral panic, and not about whether or not to have spring sports during Covid-19. On Dec. 18 my blog, The Naked Dollar, revealed a list of race-based demands from 120 Dalton teachers. The Naked Dollar isn’t particularly well-known, but the story quickly went global.<br />The demands read like a manifesto to codify permanently the “oppressed” status of black students and teachers. Among them:<br />• Expand the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to at least 12 staffers. That works out to about one for every 100 students and would cost at least $1.5 million a year. What will they do all day? No doubt ferret out ever subtler racist infractions, real or imagined. The diversity industry needs friction to survive, so it perpetually reworks the definition of racism.<br />• Reroute 50% of contributions to Dalton to the New York public school system. An effective 50% tax rate on donations—the lifeblood of any private school—is a good way of ensuring that alumni close their wallets. How will the school pay all those diversity officers?<br />• Compensate “any Black student or student of color” who participate in antiracism initiatives or has his images used in school publications. Financial favoritism based solely on skin color seems an invitation to a civil-rights lawsuit.</td>

Criminalizing policy disappointments and managerial errors is a symptom of this failure, not its cure.<br />Still, the particulars of the indictment being sought by relatives of early victims will ring bells for many Americans: the shipping of infected persons to nursing homes, failure to test patients who couldn’t be connected to China, failing to order lockdowns sooner, worrying about the potential impact on businesses.<br />The U.S. remains in a similar phase of denial, with every failure related to testing, mask promotion, etc., spun as a missed chance to extinguish Covid altogether. When the reality principle intrudes, here’s suspecting the greatest failure will be the one we are least willing to acknowledge or even understand: It began with our strange reticence to acknowledge the reality of mild (and, as it turned out,  asymptomatic) Covid.<br />Any alert person knew from the get-go that, amid the exigencies of Wuhan, Chinese doctors were failing to detect mild cases, and that thousands of these cases were likely being exported to the world. Whatever the horrors in Wuhan’s hospitals, they happened not because Covid-19 is an extravagantly deadly respiratory infection. They happened because a flu-like disease had been allowed to spread unrecognized for months in an urban population unprotected by any prior immunity or vaccine.<br />Yet it instantly became a U.S. journalistic trope to accuse anyone mentioning the flu of “downplaying” the new disease—downplaying anything being the worst sin in journalism.</td>

      <td>Biological classiﬁcation conforms perfectly with the patterns of evolutionary relationships evidenced by anatomy, physiology and genetics.</td>
      <td>The great but grumpy biologist J.B.S. Haldane was once asked what evidence would disprove evolution, whereupon he growled: “Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian.” He was referring to the evolutionary fact that complex multicellular creatures came along later than simple, unicellular ones. A bit surprising, perhaps, that one of the foremost evolutionary geneticists of the 20th century immediately reached for a paleontological example, but Haldane’s reply was well-suited for public consumption, because then—as now—when most people thought of evolution, they were likely to conjure images of dinosaur fossils.<br />Donald Prothero is a research associate in vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. When I learned he had written a book that examined 25 different discoveries relating to evolution, I assumed that he, like Haldane, would deploy paleontology in making his case. Mr. Prothero’s book is indeed tilted toward examples from the world of ancestral creatures, but, refreshingly, also guides the reader through impressive discoveries in embryology and molecular genetics.<br />“The Story of Evolution in 25 Discoveries” is a parade of self-contained vignettes, often including biographical sketches of the scientists who made and interpreted each discovery. This particular story begins (like everything else) with the big bang, followed by the fascinating tale of how science gradually came to understand the age of the Earth: From biblical literalism; through Lord Kelvin’s famous underestimate, in the 1890s, of 20 million years; to our current understanding of 4.5 billion years. Then comes a whirlwind tour of evolutionary change as it occurs, in real time, among microbes, plants, insects, fish, birds and mammals, obliterating the creationist canard that evolution hasn’t even been witnessed, let alone studied.<br />Some of the most impressive evolutionary stories involve common body plans, technically known as homologies. Thanks to Mr. Prothero, I now know that Aristotle first noticed this widespread phenomenon, of which Darwin wrote: “What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative positions?” Curious indeed. And strongly suggestive of common descent—or, for anti-evolutionists, of a Creator’s insistence on sticking with the same divine blueprint, or “archetype,” even when other more direct routes should have been available. The Darwinian story provides scientific insight into why homologies occur, whereas the theological story simply reiterates that they occur.<br />And on we go, to the embryonic similarities of otherwise distantly related creatures (“ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny”) and then biogeography (“the sinking of Noah’s Ark”), which shows, among other relevant findings, that the flora and fauna of islands resemble those of nearby continents—a phenomenon that wouldn’t necessarily be expected if each had been a special, independent creation. The story of life continues, detailing how living things within natural categories share those common body plans, or, as Darwin put it, how “organic beings have been found to resemble each other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under groups.” As a result, instead of being arbitrary, our system of biological classification conforms perfectly with the nested, branching patterns of evolutionary relationships demonstrated by anatomy, physiology and genetics. Moreover, as Mr. Prothero points out, “if life had been specially created rather than evolved, there would be no reason for the molecular systems to reflect this pattern of similarity seen in megascopic features . . . [and] not even Darwin could have dreamed that the genetic code of every cell in your body also shows the evidence of evolution.”</td>

Before we hung up, his voice took on a trace of irony. “Well,” he said, “this is going to be great for your career.” . . .

And the Biden administration might appeal the ruling in an effort to fend off future GOP information demands.<br />At the center of the case is an obscure 1928 law that has rarely been invoked and that allows any seven members of the Oversight Committee to jointly demand and receive information from the executive branch.

      <td>This adaptation of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels is a comic journey into dystopian ideas.</td>
      <td>Terry Pratchett’s Discworld, the setting of 41 novels by the phenomenally prolific author, was carried on the back of four elephants and a turtle. Its TV incarnation, “The Watch,” is carried by Richard Dormer, Northern Irish actor and “Game of Thrones” veteran. His Commander Sam Vimes, as we see in episode 1, begins his career as an idealistic member of what passes for a police force in the Discworld locale of Ankh-Morpork. But after the emptying of “9321 bottles of booze,” the loss of “68,242 brain cells” and the neutering of law enforcement by the city’s administration, he has become a combination of Popeye and Keith Richards, a scowling, ambling, slightly addlepated detective who will still rise—albeit with considerable difficulty—to the occasion.<br />The advantage of adapting someone as celebrated as Pratchett, who died in 2015, is that his work comes with a built-in fan base. The downside is that said base generally takes its dystopian fantasy very seriously, even work as comic as Pratchett’s. And the fans already have an idea of what it should look like and who should play whom. I am no Pratchett authority, but Mr. Dormer presents a more than acceptable Vimes, with his antic comedic flair, the fractured cowboy rhythms of his gait and Clint Eastwood-inspired cigars that migrate from one side of his mouth to the other as he ponders the great questions of his place and time. Among them: How can the villainous but conflicted Carcer Dun (Samuel Adewunmi) still be alive, when Vimes saw his old friend-cum-foe fall to his death 20 years before? How can he not have aged a day? Is Carcer’s evil plan somehow connected to the magic afoot at Unseen University? And is a missing library book connected to the dragon attacks besieging the city?<br />And what of the City Watch, which Pratchett made the subject of so many novels? Behind every truly memorable act of predictive fantasy lies a serious idea, Pratchett’s being the benighted wisdom of the Ankh-Morpork authorities: Shortly after Vimes joined the Watch, the crime-ridden city decided to recognize and authorize guilds devoted to specific illicit pursuits—a Thieves Guild, an Assassins Guild, a Drug-Pushers Guild, even an Alchemists Guild. As long as the malefactors stayed within their quotas, they were immune to arrest or prosecution. Crime rates actually dropped. But the effect on the Watch was devastating. Dispiriting. Dissipating. Just look at Vimes.<br />The revitalization of the force is effectuated by several near-simultaneous occurrences: The re-emergence of Carcer, of course; the introduction to the Watch of Constable Carrot (Adam Hugill), a fresh-faced and very tall young lad who was raised by dwarves (and tries rather cluelessly to enforce what we’d normally think of as law); and the arrival of Lady Sybil Ramkin (Lara Rossi), a self-possessed and very capable all-around force of justice who rankles Vimes but allies with him to track down Carcer and thwart dragons. Along with them are the mysterious Angua (Marama Corlett), who happens to be a werewolf; the forensics expert Cheery (Jo Eaton-Kent) and, making an occasional cameo appearance, Death himself (Wendell Pierce).<br />The first episode of “The Watch” will play Thursday on AMC+, then again during a two-episode presentation Sunday night at 8 p.m. on BBC America with subsequent episodes materializing on AMC+ and BBC America every Sunday. “The Watch” can’t be taken as seriously as that erstwhile Sunday night staple, “Game of Thrones.” On the upside, it’s a lot more fun.</td>

      <td>The genre, which takes familiar sounds from electronic pop, rap and dance and intensifies them through compression, distortion and exaggeration, broke into the mainstream this year thanks to figures like 100 Gecs and A.G. Cook.</td>
      <td><br /><br />On Dec. 4, electro-pop outfit 100 Gecs released a new holiday-themed song, “Sympathy 4 the Grinch.” The track by the duo Dylan Brady and Laura Les is an impossibly fast and frenetic number that welds the pogoing bounce of ska with the explosive choruses of pop-punk while adding a thick coating of distorted electronics to chirpy, pitched-up vocals. Like many songs by 100 Gecs, it’s polarizing, beloved by fans for its infectious energy but seemingly designed to clear the room of anyone who doesn’t connect to their aesthetic. For those in the latter camp, it’s as annoying as music gets. The genre? It’s usually called hyperpop, and 100 Gecs, along with London producer A.G. Cook, are among its most visible proponents.<br />Hyperpop artists take familiar sounds from electronic pop, rap and dance and intensify them through compression, exaggerating the elements that scanned as “artificial”—programmed drums, Auto-Tuned vocals, the blaring synths found in videogames—to create a cartoonish wall of noise that embraces catchy tunes and memorable hooks. The music zooms between beauty and ugliness, as shimmery melodies collide with mangled instrumentation. The genre tag was originally applied in 2014 to Mr. Cook’s London-based collective and label PC Music, but now reaches much further: In August 2019, streaming platform Spotify, responding to the growing popularity of 100 Gecs, created the hyperpop playlist to highlight this scene. Many of the tracks found in the site’s survey, which currently has almost 150,000 subscribers, are created by teenagers, some as young as 15. It’s a style utterly of this moment that is also difficult to pin down, since it is continuously mutating.<br />Mr. Cook and 100 Gecs had a big year in 2020—as did hyperpop as a whole. The latter released a remix album, “1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues,” and its two members, individually and collectively, produced music for more than a dozen songs by others, including British singer Charli XCX and bawdy Maryland rapper Rico Nasty. A.G. Cook, who is Charli XCX’s creative director, co-produced and co-wrote her excellent album “How I’m Feeling Now,” released in May; co-wrote and co-produced “Shiver” by Jónsi, frontman of Icelandic dream-rock band Sigur Rós; and issued two albums under his own name, the 49-track “7G” and the concise “Apple.” These are the most visible products of the genre’s current wave, but the scene around the sound goes much deeper and is fueled by the digital culture created by teenagers.</td>

Mr. Trump has blamed fraud for his defeat in the November election, but no significant fraud has emerged.<br />“This week the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus,” Mr. McConnell said, without offering further details. A person familiar with his thinking said Mr. McConnell was considering putting all three items into one bill.<br />The comments came after several Republican senators, including two competing in runoffs soon that will decide control of the Senate, said they would support larger checks.<br />Mr. Trump signed a Covid-19 aid bill into law Sunday but said that the $600 payments in that package were too small. The House then moved to vote to increase the size of the checks to $2,000, which passed Monday night 275 to 134, with 44 Republicans joining almost all Democrats in support.</td>

      <td>The federal government on Tuesday issued new dietary guidelines that keep current allowances for sugar and alcohol consumption unchanged, rejecting recommendations by its scientific advisory committee to make significant cuts.<br />The scientific committee, which was composed of 20 academics and doctors, had recommended cutting the limit for added sugars in the diet to 6% of daily calories from 10% in the current guidelines, citing rising rates of obesity and the link between obesity and health problems like Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The committee also recommended lowering the limit for alcoholic beverages for men to one drink per day from two, matching the guidance for women. It pointed to research linking greater alcohol consumption to a higher risk of death.<br />The new guidelines do include the scientific committee’s recommendation that children under age 2 consume no added sugars at all. This is the first time the guidelines have included recommendations for babies and toddlers. Added sugars are those found in processed foods—in everything from soda to breakfast cereal—as well as honey and sugar itself. They don’t include sugars naturally found in foods like fruit and milk.<br />The dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years, have a wide impact: They shape school lunch programs, mold state and local health-promotion efforts, and influence what food companies produce.<br />The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services reviewed the committee’s recommendations, which were released in July, and decided not to include the lower limits because “the new evidence is not substantial enough to support changes to quantitative recommendations for either added sugars or alcohol,” said Brandon Lipps, deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the USDA. Mr. Lipps said that the new limits recommended by the scientific committee didn’t meet a “preponderance of the evidence” standard required by law.</td>

      <td>Chunky clogs have become improbably trendy, with brands like Chanel, Hermès and Louis Vuitton offering high-fashion takes. Here, the footwear’s surprising history, from Dutch workers’ shoes to the Paris runways.</td>
      <td>ON HER FIRST date with Joe Biden, in 1975, Jill Biden, then a college student at the University of Delaware, immediately noticed his shoes. As she later recounted, “I had been dating guys in jeans and clogs and T-shirts, he came to the door and he had a sport coat and loafers and I thought, ‘God, this is never going to work, not in a million years.’”<br />As the incoming first lady observed, the divide between the clogged and the unclogged can seem vast. On the one side, bohemian aplomb; on the other, an uptight suspicion of any shoe that shares an etymology with plumbing mishaps. But reader, she married him. Is the gap really as yawning as we assume it to be?<br />It’s certainly narrowing, especially now that both mass-market and luxury brands are bringing new designs to eager consumers. In September,  Crocs  released a collaboration with the Puerto Rican rap star Bad Bunny that sold out in 16 minutes. And this season, Hermès, which is better known for handbags with yearslong waiting lists, is releasing its anticipated iteration; priced at $990, it’s in the new category of luxury clog. The Hermès design comes on the heels of  Louis Vuitton ,  Gucci, Dior and Chanel versions, not to mention more affordable offerings from Everlane and Gap, all of which are late to the party compared with No. 6, the New York brand whose earthy pairs made wood-soled shoes a fashionable class signifier 15 years ago.<br />This clog blossoming suggests not just a high-fashion takeover of a shoe formerly associated with artisans and hippies, but its newly broad appeal.<br />As with everything this year, the growing visibility of clogs has been shaped by the pandemic. With less of a reason to wear formal shoes, either because of unemployment or closed offices, clogs’ slip-on, slip-off ease is understandably appealing. And perhaps because their comfort and support makes them a favorite of health care workers, 2020’s superheroes, they’ve taken on an associative feel-good glow.</td>

In arguing for an end to lockdowns once vulnerable populations have been vaccinated, their analysis assumes that there is a binary outcome from Covid-19 infections: Either it kills you or it’s no threat at all.<br />Follow-up studies, however, have demonstrated that long-term cognitive and behavioral problems are common, affecting up to 20% of hospitalized survivors and up to 10% of patients with a much milder disease. There are a significant number of Covid patients who are left with chronic respiratory problems, chronic anosmia and cardiac sequela, and these problems aren’t limited to the elderly. The rest of the population is also at risk and must be protected, even if immediate death isn’t likely.<br />Most Americans would love to see the end of our public-health measures, but this is far too soon.

      <td>Jason Riley is right to highlight the work of James Flynn.</td>
      <td>In “An Intelligent Discussion About Race and IQ Is Possible” (Upward Mobility, Dec. 16), Jason Riley is right to highlight the work of James Flynn. The late researcher of the complex genetic and environmental factors relating to intelligence believed, as Mr. Riley puts it, that “dodging difficult topics was intellectual cowardice.” That brings to mind cancel culture, the apotheosis of intellectual cowardice. Does the need to shut down discussion, out of fear or plain rage, have its roots in genetic or environmental factors? We should study that, too.<br />Tom O’Hare<br />Charlestown, R.I.<br /><br />Mr. Riley quotes Flynn’s remark: “To advise scholars that they should not systemically investigate race and IQ seems to me to raise the question of what we are afraid of.” The Trump era has provided a bit of clarity on how one might begin to answer that. We aren’t afraid of the evidence or the truth about racial differences. We are afraid of individuals who wield great power and demonstrate little appreciation of the finer points. Do we need to go public with findings that we know will be used to substantiate distorted conclusions?</td>

      <td>Natural-gas prices are heading for their second consecutive big monthly drop, stung by warmer-than-expected weather forecasts that are denting demand for the heating fuel.<br />Even though it posted an outsize rebound on Tuesday, the front-month natural-gas futures contract has fallen 14.4% this month. That would mark its second straight monthly decline bigger than 14% and largest monthly drop since January. Prices are more than 25% below a peak hit in late October and have suffered four daily drops of at least 6% this month, a period of outsize volatility punctuated by Monday’s 8.5% slide and Tuesday’s recovery.<br />Natural-gas prices often gyrate in the winter because demand in the season is driven by how frequently people use their heaters. The power-generation fuel is used as the primary source of heat for roughly half of the homes in the U.S., so speculative investors often position for demand and prices to rally in the colder months of the year.<br />Recent weather forecasts show warmer temperatures spreading across the U.S. in the next few weeks, though, driving an unwind of bullish bets and fresh price declines.<br />“It is becoming increasingly apparent that the market will need to gradually discount another warmer-than-normal winter,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.</td>

      <td>As this difficult year slinks to its unlamented end, I have felt compelled to ask myself: What do I believe so much that if necessary I will fight for it the way America’s revolutionaries did, with their lives, fortunes and sacred honor? And how do my beliefs compare with the widening spectrum of beliefs about America?<br />Many populist conservatives believe that America was at its best in the 1950s, when men were men and women were women, manufacturing dominated the economy, white Christians dominated the culture, patriotism was unquestioned, and divisive social issues hadn’t entered the public agenda.<br />I believe in America the way liberals do—not as perfect, but capable of being made “more perfect.” I believe in America the way Abraham Lincoln did at Gettysburg when he promised a new birth of freedom built on the foundation of the Declaration of Independence. I believe in America the way Martin Luther King Jr. did when he rooted his dream in the American dream and denominated the unpaid promissory note to black Americans in the principles of the declaration. I believe in America the way that Bill Clinton did when he declared in his 1993 inaugural address, “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.”<br />There are those who don’t believe that America ever was, or ever can be, worthy of devotion. On the far left, some argue that America is irredeemably marked by slavery, conquest and genocide. They are right that we should seek to understand and to teach history fully, without glossing over its brutalities. But it is one thing to be honest about the past, another to use it as proof of a national original sin that can never be expunged. At the end of this road is despair—or revolution.<br />On the far right there are those who give America’s original sin a different name—liberalism. They claim that the Declaration of Independence inspired by John Locke has led us down the primrose path. A polity based on individual rights liberates appetites and destroys morality, they say, and the civil law created to protect liberty becomes the source of its destruction. At the end of this road lies theocracy, which could only be achieved at the point of the sword, or withdrawal into faith communities whose existence is protected by the polity their members scorn.</td>

      <td>Prices won’t break out of the $40 to $50 range until consumption gets back to normal sometime next year.</td>
      <td>When will oil sustainably break out of the “Virus Alley”—that $40 to $50 band that has held oil prices in check for months? That’s Question No. 1 going into 2021 for an oil industry that has dramatically retrenched and investors who have abandoned the sector because of a lack of returns. It will also determine when U.S. shale recovers from its pandemic malaise and resumes growth.<br />Only a year ago prospects looked pretty good. Optimism about the world economy at the beginning of 2020 had a barrel of Brent crude at $70. Then came a pandemic that was in almost no company’s—or country’s—emergency plans. The general view of something called SARS-CoV-2 was initially conditioned by the experience of SARS-1 in the early 2000s, which had about 8,000 cases world-wide and fewer than 800 deaths.<br />But by March the highly transmissible coronavirus was precipitating a world-wide shutdown, the worst global recession in 74 years, and the constriction of movement by both car and plane. That led to a plummeting of global oil demand and a price collapse that saw prices go “negative,” or below zero, as producers paid people to take their oil away because storage tanks were filled to overflowing.<br />The rebound from negative prices and the stabilization of the market was made possible by unprecedented production cuts by the group that calls itself OPEC-plus—the 13 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and a group of 10 other producing nations led by Russia. That U.S.-brokered agreement got oil prices up into the $40 to $50 range of Virus Alley, blocked at one end by the virus and at the other by the uncertain prospect for vaccines. Now that vaccines are here, prices have moved to the $50 end of the alley. But will they rise into that higher band of $50 to $65 that will enable companies to start spending and attract investors?<br />In the short term, such a rebound will be challenged. The resurgence of the virus is again leading to shutdowns, reducing economic activities. A clear indication of this was provided by the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., when  IHS Markit ’s  weekly survey showed that gasoline demand had fallen to a level last seen in 1997. But on the expectation of widespread vaccinations by the spring, IHS Markit estimates that global economic growth in 2021 will reach 4.5%. While this will cancel out the 4% decline of 2020, small business and other sectors will be left devastated.</td>

      <td>Activist hedge fund Third Point LLC is urging  Intel Corp.  to consider strategic changes after a year in which the U.S. semiconductor giant suffered new product delays and lost its rank as America’s most valued chip company.<br />Third Point said in a letter Tuesday to Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak, “We suggest the board retain a reputable investment advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives, including whether Intel should remain an integrated device manufacturer and the potential divestment of certain failed acquisitions.”<br />Intel said it “welcomes input from all investors regarding enhanced shareholder value. In that spirit, we look forward to engaging with Third Point LLC on their ideas towards that goal.”<br />Intel, which both designs and builds its own chips, said this year that it would consider outsourcing the manufacturing of some of its most advanced chips. The company is expected to decide soon where it will make future generations of processors.<br />Third Point said Intel risks triggering broader implications for U.S. tech supremacy if it fails to act. “Without immediate change at Intel, we fear that America’s access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia to power everything from PCs to data centers to critical infrastructure and more,” the letter says.</td>

Mr. Parks is now seeking unspecified damages, according to the complaint, over allegations including false arrest, civil-rights violations and emotional distress.<br />The New Jersey state police, Woodbridge police and prosecutors in Middlesex County didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. New York state police officials, whom the Woodbridge police sent photographs for facial-recognition comparison, said their records showed they didn’t provide any leads in the case.<br />Police increasingly have adopted facial-recognition software into their crime-solving arsenal. Advocates say it is an effective new technology that has helped solve many cases, but the tools have drawn growing scrutiny in law enforcement in part because of the potential consequences of a false match.</td>

      <td>Vermont is a tough place to visit this winter, but if you don’t want to socialize, here’s where to quarantine cozily</td>
      <td>HIDING OUT in Vermont’s snowy Green Mountains presents some challenges during Covid-times—but that’s the allure. The state’s strict regulations, wide-open spaces and intelligent epidemic management have led to one of the country’s lowest rates of infection. A tough place to visit, Vermont requires all out-of-state travelers to quarantine for seven days if they have a negative Covid test or 14 days without one—either before they leave home or after arrival. The state also limits locals and visitors alike from gathering with people from other households. Lodgings and restaurants and even ski resorts, however, are open at limited capacity.<br />The obstacles have kept most visitors at home, but if you don’t mind quarantining and don’t want to socialize, Vermont can be your own private snow globe this winter. And if you’re a skier, 50% lower capacity on peak weekends on the mountains means 50% fewer people scraping off the powder. We recommend these three, extra-safe lodging strategies, all focused on southern Vermont counties with even lower Covid rates than the rest of the state. Strap on your snowshoes.<br />The owners of the Homestyle Hotel Inn + Restaurant in Ludlow recently took over a motel in an 1830s building across the street and turned it into the Main + Mountain Bar and Motel. The transformed hostelry’s second-floor accommodations feature cool hues of white and gray, with live-edge headboards and white subway tile.<br />Covid-safety bonus: The motel has contactless check-in and pickup from the bar downstairs, and every room’s doors and windows open to the outside. Best of all, this fall the owners closed the hotel part of their property across the street and turned its former guest rooms into private dining rooms for the Homestyle Restaurant.<br />Surroundings: The homey mill town of Ludlow has emerged as one of Southern Vermont’s best dining destinations, and is about a five-minute drive from the access road to Okemo Mountain.</td>

      <td>From free tests to the shielding of care homes, Tübingen has pioneered tools later deployed elsewhere to minimize pandemic casualties</td>
      <td>Concern is growing in Europe over access to vaccine doses during the winter wave of Covid-19. But one town claims to have found a formula to prevent high mortality without a draconian lockdown.<br />The southern German city of Tübingen was hit hard by the virus in the spring, but measures such as widely available testing and even subsidizing taxi rides have since managed to protect the elderly, who make up most of the fatalities.<br />At the peak of the first wave in April, the town had 70 Covid-19 patients in its biggest hospital—out of 89,000 inhabitants—including 33 in intensive care, forcing doctors to cancel elective surgery. Now, at the height of the far more devastating current surge, patients number just 35, many transferred from other regions. Fifteen of them are in intensive care, of whom fewer than half are Tübingen residents. The hospital hasn’t canceled non-urgent surgery.<br />Local authorities say such numbers are no accident. The town, they point out, started earlier than most German municipalities in carrying out frequent Covid-19 tests on care-home staff, residents and visitors. It subsidizes taxi rides for those over age 65 so they don’t have to use public transit. Younger residents are discouraged from shopping between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. so as to avoid seniors having to mingle with people who are more likely to carry the virus without symptoms.<br />Tübingen’s pandemic policy has so far cost it half a million euros, all financed through the town‘s budget. A week of the current lockdown, with restaurants and all nonessential stores closed, costs the German economy and the state between €27 billion and €57 billion in lost output and subsidies, according to estimates by the Ifo Institute, a government-funded economics think tank in Munich.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—A string of new Covid-19 clusters poses a test to China’s more targeted approach toward pandemic control as the country draws closer to the Lunar New Year holiday, typically a time when hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel to see relatives.<br />Authorities in recent weeks have avoided the sweeping enforced lockdowns and business closures that were put into place at the beginning of the year after the coronavirus first emerged in central China, sticking to more selective and less invasive measures that kept the virus spread in check without hurting the economic recovery.<br />“There will be increased personnel flow and gathering, and the prevention and control of the epidemic will face a major test,” top Beijing municipal officials said last week, referring to the coming Lunar New Year holiday, which is set to begin Feb. 12.<br />Eight locally transmitted infections with symptoms were found in the northeastern province of Liaoning on Monday, China’s National Health Commission reported Tuesday.<br />Six of the patients were detected in the provincial capital of Shenyang, while the other two were found in Liaoning’s port city of Dalian, whose 5.6 million residents have undergone citywide testing since the outbreak was spotted in mid-December. Over the past two weeks, authorities in Dalian have tallied up 35 symptomatic carriers, including the two reported Tuesday. Hundreds of flights into and out of Shenyang and Dalian have been suspended in recent days to prevent the further spread of the disease.</td>

      <td>‘Wonder Woman 1984’ producer Charles Roven says theatrical model is the lifeblood of franchise films</td>
      <td>This Christmas weekend, millions of movie lovers tuned in to watch Wonder Woman fly across their televisions instead of on towering movie screens. While convenient for some and for others the only way to see the movie, the creators of the production describe streaming as a regrettable medium for superhero films.<br />Star Gal Gadot, who plays the main character in “Wonder Woman 1984,” said in an interview the streaming experience for viewers is unlikely to match going to the movie theater. “Cinemas have the ability to give fans the 360 experience,” she said.<br />Director Patty Jenkins even shot the film with special IMAX cameras hoping to amplify the scale of the 2½ hour action-packed spectacle.<br />The producer of “Wonder Woman 1984,” Charles Roven, who has made a career out of producing big-budget franchise films, also said the big screen is key to superhero movies’ success with fans. But, in Hollywood, where the genre has dominated the business for more than a decade, their allure is also about profitability, he said. The longtime producer isn’t convinced WarnerMedia’s plan to debut his films, “Wonder Woman 1984” and next year’s “The Suicide Squad” in theaters and on streaming service HBO Max simultaneously, makes economic sense.<br />“If you’re making a movie that costs $200 million plus and you want it to be viable,” it needs a big theatrical debut, said Mr. Roven. “People want the spectacle so that’s why you spend the money. They come to see it. That generates the profits.”</td>

      <td>For many teenagers, the past year has been a blur of online classes, remote extracurriculars and virtual holiday celebrations. The shift to small-screen living might not seem like a major adjustment for teens already glued to their devices, but it has reshaped what is most critical to them: their friendships.<br />I interviewed five teenagers across the country to learn what nearly a year of living virtually has been like for them. A common theme is that their tech choices—or those of their parents and even their friends’ parents—dictate with whom they have stayed in touch. That was the case, to some extent, before the Covid-19 pandemic, but it has become starker in the months since many in-person interactions came to an abrupt end in March.<br />Nearly half of the 849 teens surveyed by Common Sense Media late last spring reported feeling less connected than usual with their friends after schools closed. Students who had once talked to certain friends every day in the school cafeteria or in the hallway suddenly lost touch with all but their closest pals once schools shut down, unless they happened to be connected on the same social-media apps. Some even lost touch with their best friends because of the technology they do or don’t use.<br />Here is how these teenagers say technology has dictated their friendships in the months since the pandemic altered their social interactions.<br />Ian Pase, a 16-year-old from Anaheim Hills, Calif., who has attended his public school remotely since the spring, prefers Snapchat to keep in touch with friends. “There are a lot of people who I’m not superclose friends with who I liked talking to in class but we don’t have each other’s social media so we can’t really communicate anymore,” he said. “I also have friends who don’t have Snapchat because their parents don’t allow them to have it. They use Instagram to text each other so there’s kind of a disconnect.”</td>

      <td>President-elect Joe Biden’s narrow victory in Georgia last month was driven in part by shifts toward the Democratic ticket in a collection of nine counties with strong ties to the military.<br />As a group, the military counties backed President Trump. However, his victory margin was 7.8 percentage points less than in 2016, a greater movement than the 5.3-point swing toward Mr. Biden statewide. And while voter turnout grew by less than 21% across Georgia, the number of votes cast in military counties rose by nearly 26%.<br />Now, Mr. Trump’s veto of the annual defense policy bill is adding new complications to GOP voter turnout efforts ahead of Jan. 5 Georgia runoff elections that will determine control of the U.S. Senate. Mr. Trump said he rejected the bill due to provisions that would remove Confederate names of military bases, limit his ability to withdraw troops abroad and didn’t remove legal protections for internet platforms he says squelch conservative voices.<br />The $740.5 billion bill passed the House and Senate with bipartisan majorities, including support from Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the two Georgia Republicans defending their seats in the runoffs.<br />The two senators must now decide whether to support a president who could help boost Republican turnout in the runoffs or back a veto override of the bill. The legislation authorizes $168 million in military construction projects in Georgia, funds for educating military children and enhanced hazard pay and bonuses for certain military personnel, among other things.</td>

Investors include Tokyo-based trading company  Mitsubishi Corp.<br />The government-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation said Tuesday it would lend slightly more than a third of the total $1.767 billion in financing for the project. It said the project would “contribute to economic development in Vietnam through the stable supply of electricity.” Japanese commercial banks and the Export-Import Bank of Korea are also providing financing.<br />The project has become a flashpoint in the debate over whether rich nations should continue supporting coal-fired power in developing nations with growing electricity demand.<br />Critics of the project include a group of international investors and Japan’s own environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, who is considered a potential future prime minister. In January, Mr. Koizumi said the project couldn’t gain the understanding of the international community.</td>

      <td>U.S. doesn’t need to reach full herd immunity before public spaces can begin phased reopenings</td>
      <td>As 2021 arrives, there is one question that matters most: How soon can we escape the Covid-19 pandemic?<br />The answer is as elusive as it is pressing. It is unknown what level of natural infection and immunization is needed to reach herd immunity in the population. It is also unknown how many people in the U.S. have already contracted the coronavirus. Whatever the answer to the question, trillions of dollars in economic activity are at stake, as are millions of livelihoods.<br />By some metrics, things have never been worse: U.S. hospitalizations are at a record high, and public-health experts continue to warn that things will get worse before they get better. With more than 19 million confirmed cases in the U.S., achieving herd immunity is a ways off. After all, that figure accounts for just 6% of the U.S. population. And with daily new cases still reaching well into the hundreds of thousands, it seems unrealistic to hope for Covid-19 to vanish in the new year. Worse, public polling has suggested that some adults won’t take a vaccine if offered.<br />However, the outlook for the year ahead is much brighter than those grim figures would suggest. Eradicating Covid-19 shouldn’t be necessary to begin a gradual return to schools, restaurants, concert halls and arenas.<br />While the challenge of vaccinating a large portion of the country is significant, it might not be as daunting as it first seems. There are roughly 333 million people in the U.S., but not everyone will need a vaccine right away. For starters, about 19 million people have a confirmed case. The true number of cases is likely much higher: Many patients with confirmed cases do not show symptoms, and some people who experience symptoms consistent with Covid-19 choose not to seek medical attention. Children make up a large share of the U.S. population, and there is little evidence that schools are hot spots for spreading the virus. That suggests vaccinating children shouldn’t be a prerequisite for returning to normal. So far, the shots available in the U.S. are only authorized for patients 16 and older.</td>

The fund managed by Blumberg’s American Ventures division will be the company’s fifth distressed fund since 1992 but the first one it has raised in the past decade, according to Philip Blumberg, founder and chief executive.<br />“In this market we expect discounts of up to 35%,” Mr. Blumberg predicted. “It will be the best buying opportunity since 2010.”<br />Numerous other investment companies also think that historic opportunities await because of the havoc wrought to the commercial property market by the pandemic. Their thinking is that prices will plummet because fear of contagion has kept people away from malls, airports and office buildings.<br />Other companies that have raised or are raising distressed funds include  KKR & Co. ,  Kayne Anderson Real Estate and Terra Capital Partners.

      <td>Competing bids to Salesforce’s offer didn’t emerge, even after news of firms’ merger talks surfaced</td>
      <td>One of the largest tech deals this year also shows why there might be a lot fewer of them in the future.<br />Salesforce.com ’s  $27.7 billion acquisition of  Slack Technologies ,  announced this month, was the largest to date for the hyperacquisitive cloud-software provider, as well as the second-largest deal so far in the software space—behind IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat in 2018, according to Dealogic. The high price Salesforce paid—representing 26 times Slack’s projected revenue for the next 12 months—led many to speculate that the company faced competition on the deal.<br />But that wasn’t the case. According to a regulatory filing last week detailing the background of the merger, Slack Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield said he received “informal messages” from representatives of two large, publicly traded U.S. technology companies on Nov. 25—the day The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks between the two companies. But those reps only “expressed a desire to discuss the market rumors,” according to Mr. Butterfield. No actual competing bids emerged.<br />That isn’t a surprise. Besides the rather generous valuation Salesforce was already offering, the most likely competition would have come from tech giants that are already under intense government scrutiny.  Amazon.com  and Alphabet’s Google in particular operate large cloud businesses that could have benefited from the addition of Slack’s popular messaging platform. But Google is now the subject of several antitrust lawsuits from the federal government and most states, while Amazon is dealing with its own government probes into how it competes in the retail and cloud-services sectors.<br />Microsoft ,  while not under the same level of scrutiny, was also an unlikely bidder. The software giant has become Slack’s primary competitor with the popularity of its Teams platform, which has been reporting superior growth numbers to Slack of late. Having its own history with government crackdowns would also likely make Microsoft think twice before spending top dollar to take out a competitor. Other tech giants will be making similar calculations for the foreseeable future.</td>

      <td>The coronavirus pandemic snarled the world’s sprawling supply chains for months, shutting factories, disrupting shipping and making it difficult for companies to get products from factories to consumers.<br />Now, many companies are considering changing the model to avoid future product shortages and transportation delays, even if it might increase costs. Some are looking at moving production closer to home. Others are considering spreading small factories around the world instead of putting all their manufacturing in one place.<br />There is little evidence of a big shift so far, given the costs and the uncertainty. But surveys and interviews with corporate executives show some have started to make changes and many are seriously considering them, though consultants say the moves could take several years to roll out.<br />Below, some of the best analysis and insight from WSJ writers and columnists, the Dow Jones Newswires team and occasionally beyond, on investing, the wealth-management business and more.<br />CORONAVIRUS OUTLOOK</td>

      <td>As the rollout of wind and solar picks up speed, solutions to bridge their intermittency are likely to take off too</td>
      <td><br />The rapid growth of wind and solar power comes with a well-known problem: They don’t work all the time. Energy storage is a solution investors should watch in 2021, even if it doesn’t yet lend itself to stock picking.<br />Governments around the world greatly raised their decarbonization ambitions this year. There is great uncertainty about how their promises will be delivered, but almost all scenarios involve massive building of solar and wind farms. As their share of power production grows, it will become crucial to bridge the times when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine.<br />Building wind and solar together can reduce the gaps, while gas-fueled power plants can provide a nonrenewable backup. Also helpful are demand-side response agreements—when big power consumers promise to cut their usage during pinch points in exchange for lower prices.<br />Even with all these methods, though, it will be necessary to store excess electricity for use in lean times.</td>

      <td>A handful of startups and larger firms are experimenting with nationally competitive, nonlocalized pay. Is the extra cost worth the added employee goodwill?</td>
      <td>Tech workers and employers alike are beginning to question location-focused pay scales. A handful of companies are moving to abandon them altogether.<br />In setting pay without regard for location, tech companies including Reddit Inc. and  Zillow Group Inc.  are making a potentially expensive gamble to retain talent and gain a hiring edge. The move can entail maintaining relatively high salaries of employees who are relocating, and adopting a revised scale for new hires. Though it is early, the move challenges a long-held, but not universal, notion that where people live should determine what they make.<br />Some big tech firms including  Facebook Inc.  were clear early on in the pandemic that people moving away from the Bay Area to less expensive cities would see a pay cut. Payment platform Stripe Inc. offered one-time bonuses for workers who moved out of San Francisco, Seattle or New York—and agreed to a pay cut of up to 10%.<br />But a pay cut for any reason can be bad for worker morale, said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination. “Employers really have to do a bit of a dance to justify it to workers,” he said.<br />Workers considering more flexible work scenarios are themselves divided. A November survey of 600 tech workers by the job-search platform Indeed found that 60% of respondents would be willing to take a pay cut to work remotely permanently while 40% said they wouldn’t.</td>

      <td>A burst of central bank bond-buying has revived a debate about quantitative easing’s potential fiscal cost</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and  Bank of Japan  have collectively expanded their balance sheets by around $8 trillion in 2020. It took them almost eight years to achieve the same growth following the seizure of global financial markets in September 2008.<br />That burst of bond-buying has revived a debate about quantitative easing, and how it might impose a fiscal cost on the countries pursuing it. But the circumstances in which to worry look fairly limited.<br />The logic goes like this: When the central bank buys bonds from commercial banks, the proceeds are credited to those banks in the form of additional reserves parked at the monetary authority. The central bank then pays interest on those reserves. In periods like the past decade when the market value of bond portfolios has swelled, that has been profitable for central banks.<br />But if interest rates were to rise, all that might reverse: The central bank would be paying higher interest on its reserves—very short-term liabilities—and the value of its long-maturity bondholdings would decline. That might leave the central bank requiring assistance from the fiscal authority to be recapitalized, or at the very least cut short the profit central banks return to their finance ministries.<br />The important factor is the circumstances in which major developed economies might face an unexpected rise in inflation. There is a great deal we still don’t really know about inflationary pressure. But if it came from an economy genuinely running hot, it is very likely that tax revenues would be rising anyway, more than offsetting any expense rising from central bank losses.</td>

      <td>Widespread return isn’t likely until late spring or early summer of 2021</td>
      <td>Office-building landlords are hoping that the massive Covid-19 vaccination campaign launched in the U.S. this month will lead to millions of people returning to workplaces in 2021 after spending most of the pandemic working from home.<br />But it isn’t going to be soon. Rather, a widespread return probably won’t take place until the late spring or early summer of 2021 when enough people have been vaccinated in the U.S. for the population to come close to achieving “herd immunity,” according to public-health professionals and executives in the real-estate industry.<br />Moreover, the office world that will be reinhabited next year will look a lot different from the one that was hurriedly vacated in mid-March when the fear of Covid-19 sent much of the U.S. labor force into lockdown. During an initial transition period, office density likely will be low, workers will wear masks and a range of other safety precautions will be followed.<br />Long-term changes in the workplace will continue for years. Working from home and other remote locations, which became a necessity during the pandemic, will likely remain a major part of the workplace, employers and real-estate executives say.<br />Businesses that are highly competitive for top talent will likely begin opening small satellite offices in metropolitan areas and offering employees the option of working there, at home or in centralized headquarters—or a combination of the three. Design firm Gensler already is working with a half dozen Fortune 100 companies on such “hub-and-spoke” strategies, as they are becoming known in the office industry, said Joseph Brancato, co-chairman of the firm.</td>

Professional investors such as Stanley Druckenmiller and companies like Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. began investing this year. Companies like Robinhood Markets Inc. and  PayPal Holdings Inc.  allowed their customers to buy and sell bitcoin.<br />Despite those inroads, industry watchers say bitcoin must gain traction as a form of payment to become more ubiquitous. Spending it isn’t easy. Few merchants accept it, and many people are still unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency. Its use is generally limited to high-end purchases, like those at Mr. Dossa’s dealership.<br />Bitcoin, introduced in 2008, was designed to operate as a form of electronic cash, allowing users to exchange value as quickly and cheaply as sending an email. In practice, its adoption was hampered by several factors. In early years, it was difficult for average users to operate the digital wallets that stored their holdings. Many of the companies that tried accepting bitcoin in 2014 and 2015, including  Expedia Group Inc.  and Dell Inc., later quietly dropped it.</td>

But with a single announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration is formally pivoting from approving case-by-case exemptions to setting broad safety standards the industry has long sought.<br />The new approach, replacing stringent protections that currently bar practically all home-delivery options, go into effect in two months, but some requirements are likely to take years to implement.<br />The detailed regulations, which total more than 700 pages and parts of which had been in the works since the Obama administration, also aim to address concerns related to law enforcement, national security and privacy protection.<br />“They get us closer to the day when we will more routinely see drone operations such as the delivery of packages,” FAA chief Steve Dickson said in a written statement accompanying the rules. Mr. Dickson has told colleagues he intends to stay on under the Biden administration, according to people involved in the conversations, to fill out the remainder of his five-year term ending in 2024.

      <td>Maybe the GOP will stand up on trade once Joe Biden is picking winners.</td>
      <td>President Trump will soon leave town, but his tariffs may be staying. Joe Biden hasn’t been exactly clear about his trade policy, so perhaps it’s time to point out one unsightly effect of the Trump tariffs: expanding the D.C. swamp.<br />Republicans who cheered when the Trump Administration picked winners and losers might soon find out what it’s like when the Biden Administration does it. Take Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who lobbied last year for a company in his state, SM Products, to get tariff exclusions on imported Chinese-manufactured saw blades.<br />In a Sept. 19, 2019, letter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), four members of Missouri’s congressional delegation, including Mr. Hawley, argued that “it would not be beneficial to impair a small American company that does not have the financial resources or alternative supply chain options.” Since SM’s costs and prices are “locked in many months before delivery,” the legislators wrote, the Missouri company “must absorb the entire cost of the tariffs,” likely precluding profitability.<br />Join the club. Countless American businesses were in a similar situation. Most weren’t lucky enough—or connected enough—to have a U.S. Senator pleading their case. Yet you might be surprised. As Mr. Trump’s tariffs began to bite, Congress sent hundreds of letters to the USTR, supporting specific tariff exclusions. The examples here are taken from about 100 pages of correspondence from 2019, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request.<br />Mark Meadows, now the White House chief of staff, urged tariff exclusions in a Nov. 22, 2019, letter, aiming to prevent “severe economic harm to an important business in my district.” He said the USTR had “my wholehearted support in your work to combat Chinese intellectual property theft and industrial espionage.” But given how fast Mr. Trump’s tariffs were kicking in, “it was not possible for Fairfield Chair to develop a new relationship with a new supplier of similar quality.” Please, please don’t tax these beech wood components from China.</td>

      <td>President Trump finally signed the Covid-19 relief bill and 2021 budget on Sunday night, but not before giving a big assist to Democratic hopes of gaining control of the Senate in the two runoff elections on Jan. 5. Current GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is left this week trying to undo the significant political damage.<br />Mr. Trump had been insisting that Congress write checks of $2,000 each to most Americans, rather than the $600 in the bill. His own Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, negotiated the $600 figure. But after the bill passed, Mr. Trump decided that wasn’t enough.<br />Never mind that the $2,000 would go to tens of millions of Americans who have kept their jobs and maintained their incomes during the pandemic. It would also add some $350 billion or more to a federal deficit that is already into the trillions of dollars. The economy won’t benefit since the recipients aren’t going to change their behavior knowing it’s merely a one-time check.<br />Senate Republicans oppose the $2,000 for these sound reasons, but Mr. Trump has put them in a political spot. Democrats immediately joined Mr. Trump’s call for the $2,000, and on Monday House Democrats were expected to vote to approve the extra cash.<br />That leaves Mr. McConnell with a tough call of barring a vote as Democrats bang away in TV ads in Georgia against GOP incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Or he can hold a vote, which would split the GOP caucus and upset fiscally conservative voters. Either way it amounts to a Donald Trump in-kind contribution to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden.</td>

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said Monday he would sign the bill, a move cheered by tenant advocates who said the state would be enacting one of the strictest eviction moratoriums in the country. Opponents said the legislation didn’t do enough to protect landlords and could prevent struggling building owners from paying their taxes.<br />The bill effectively bans all evictions statewide for 60 days, including those already in motion. After that, tenants who are unable to pay their rent because of the coronavirus pandemic can file paperwork to prevent or suspend eviction proceedings until May 1. Households where a member is at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 are also protected under the bill.<br />“You do not solve a public health crisis, you do not solve an economic crisis, by kicking people out on the street,” said state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, a Democrat from Brooklyn. “You solve it by keeping people in their homes.”<br />The state Senate voted Monday afternoon to approve the legislation, and the Assembly continued its debate into the evening.</td>

      <td>In a 2020 campaign with little foreign policy substance, the idea Joe Biden mentioned most was restoring alliances. Which alliances? With Mr. Biden’s inauguration less than four weeks away, some allies in the Asia-Pacific are apprehensive.<br />Last week Japan’s number-two civilian defense official told Reuters: “We are concerned China will expand its aggressive stance into areas other than Hong Kong. I think one of the next targets, or what everyone is worried about, is Taiwan.”<br />Yasuhide Nakayama added: “So far, I haven’t yet seen a clear policy or an announcement on Taiwan from Joe Biden. I would like to hear it quickly, then we can also prepare our response on Taiwan in accordance.” He also asked, according to Reuters, “How will Joe Biden in the White House react in any case if China crosses this red line?”<br />Hardliners in Beijing see democratic Taiwan as a separatist province and are determined to bring it under their control. They also want Taiwan’s advanced microchip technology. Meanwhile, opinion in Taiwan has moved against unification, especially as China reneges on its treaty obligations by arresting democracy supporters in Hong Kong. A Chinese military operation across the 110-mile Taiwan Strait during Mr. Biden’s term can’t be ruled out.<br />The loss of democratic Taiwan’s independence against its will would be a geopolitical earthquake. The Pacific balance of power would shift decisively in China’s favor. Asian countries would need to recalibrate their relationship with the U.S., with dramatic implications for global security and trade.</td>

      <td>President Trump signed into law another round of direct payments to households as part of a coronavirus aid package</td>
      <td>President Trump on Dec. 27 signed into law a roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid package that will provide a second round of stimulus payments to households. Here is what we know about who will receive the checks and how they will receive the money.<br />Households will get $600 per adult and $600 a child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round delivered earlier in the pandemic. That means a single parent with two children will get $1,800 now after receiving $2,200 in the spring.<br />In all, the government will spend $164 billion on the second round.<br />The payments start phasing out when individual adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000, when head-of-household income exceeds $112,500, and when income for married couples filing jointly exceeds $150,000. For individuals without children, the payments go to zero when income reaches $87,000; that is $174,000 for married couples. The numbers are generally based on 2019 income.<br />Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week, when Congress was finishing work on the package, that the first batch of payments could go out at the beginning of the Dec. 28 week. But Mr. Trump didn’t sign the package until Sunday night—six days after final congressional approval. A senior Treasury official on Monday said the department anticipates being able to make the $600 stimulus payments “on the same timeline as previously discussed.”</td>

      <td>Paternalism is the wrong approach. Patients need full information about the risks and benefits.</td>
      <td>Now that two Covid-19 vaccines have received emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, the conversation has turned to the crucial goal of persuading as many people as possible to get vaccinated. We worry that public-health authorities may follow strategies that do more harm than good.<br />The current communication strategy—built on listening to advice from trusted leaders—is paternalistic and outdated. Public-health authorities, politicians, sports heroes and celebrities are taking to the airwaves to tout the vaccines. Protecting people from doubt is central to the strategy. That entails suppressing questions rather than answering them. Any hint about vaccine imperfections could make people apprehensive and must be avoided. Anyone who rejects the vaccine is stigmatized as foolish and irresponsible.<br />A better approach to persuasion is to assume you’re speaking to mature, self-interested decision makers, offer transparent and comprehensive information about the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and engage patients in the decision-making process. Many medical treatments require consideration of the balance between harms and benefits. Over the past 40 years the practice of medicine has evolved to embrace a process known as shared medical decision-making, in which physicians provide patients with the best scientific information about benefits and risks, and patients make decisions in collaboration with their doctors, which balance their personal preferences with imperfect science and uncertain risks. The same decision isn’t right for everyone.<br />Applying shared decision-making to the coronavirus vaccine requires authorities to change their mind-set. Instead of pressuring patients to “do the right thing,” the emphasis would be on honest disclosure about what to expect. In recent FDA hearings for the  Pfizer  and the Moderna vaccines, multiple witnesses pointed to higher-than-expected side-effect rates. For both vaccines, these rates appear to be higher than those for other commonly used inoculations, such Pneumovax 23 and Shingrix, for which patients frequently report side effects.<br />In both Covid-19 trials, substantial majorities of participants in the vaccine group had local reactions at the injection site. More than half of participants experienced a systemic side effect like fatigue, headache or fever. In both studies there were a few cases of Bell’s palsy, a temporary or lasting partial paralysis of the face. These were attributed to chance because they were rare, but seven of the eight total cases in the two studies were among those who received the vaccine rather than a placebo.</td>

But as the American anthropologist Ruth Benedict once wrote in her journal, “The trouble with life isn’t that there is no answer, it’s that there are so many answers.”<br />I grew up black in the 1960s in a small South Carolina town. Trust me, today’s America is nothing like it was then. And even under segregation, the marginalization was not total. My father was a plumber, my mother a school librarian. We were treated kindly. The local shopkeepers wanted our business, but they also wanted to avoid trouble from the few who believed wholeheartedly in racial segregation.<br />The segregation wasn’t uniform. One doctor had a separate waiting room; the other didn’t. Ditto for the town’s two dentists. Once the 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawed separate facilities, things opened up very quickly.<br />Many of the authors, commentators and journalists who spend all their energy thinking and talking about race today fail to acknowledge how much has improved with regard to race in this country. There are countless successful black Americans today—doctors and lawyers, entrepreneurs and academics, journalists and artists, compassionate politicians and famous Hollywood actors.

Andrew Cuomo said Monday he will sign an executive order to penalize health-care providers that administer the Covid-19 vaccine without following state prioritization protocols.<br />The state requires that health-care workers at high risk of being exposed to the coronavirus, along with nursing home residents and staff, receive priority for the vaccine. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said that providers that ignore   this will face fines of up to $1 million and a revocation of all state licenses.<br />In addition, Mr. Cuomo said that the state attorney general’s office would now be handling a case involving ParCare Community Health Network, a health-care provider with offices in New York City and Orange County. State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said over the weekend that ParCare was being investigated by the state police for possibly obtaining the vaccine fraudulently and then transferring it to other parts of the state and administering it to the public without paying heed to the prioritization rules.<br />Ultimately, Mr. Cuomo said he wants “to send a clear signal” that the state won’t tolerate attempts to subvert the process it has put in place for vaccine distribution and administration.<br />“If you violate the law on these vaccinations, we will find out and you will be prosecuted,” he said.</td>

      <td>What do Eric Swalwell and Hunter Biden have in common?<br />Both are highly connected, Mr. Swalwell as a member of the House Intelligence Committee and Mr. Biden as the son of the incoming president. Both have made news for their dealings with China, Mr. Swalwell for his relationship with a Chinese spy named Christine Fang, and Mr. Biden for business deals made with enterprises connected to the Chinese Communist Party. Both also benefit from a U.S. press corps uninterested in getting to the bottom of their stories.<br />When the New York Post published emails in October raising doubts about Joe Biden’s claims he’d never discussed his son’s business dealings, many dismissed the story as “Russian disinformation”—and some suppressed it. As for Mr. Swalwell’s China connection, the  New York Times  still refuses even to mention it.<br />But it isn’t just the Biden and Swalwell stories the press is missing. Their cases are only a microcosm of what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo complains is an all-out Chinese Communist Party effort “to make Americans receptive to Beijing’s form of authoritarianism.” China does this on multiple fronts, often masquerading under the banner of “friendship” associations. But the agenda is always the same: to use whatever tools it has to mute opposition to China.<br />For the business sector, the pitch is simple: Come, there’s money to be made—so long as no one brings up human rights.</td>

      <td>Ashley Fettersreporting for Politico, Dec. 26:<br /><br />Books by the Foot, a service run by the Maryland-based bookseller Wonder Book, has become a go-to curator of Washington bookshelves. . . . As retro as a shelf of books might seem in an era of flat-panel screens, Books by the Foot has thrived through Democratic and Republican administrations. . . . When the coronavirus pandemic arrived, Books by the Foot had to adapt to a downturn in office- and hotel-decor business—and an uptick in home-office Zoom backdrops for the talking-head class.<br />The Wonder Book staff doesn’t pry too much into which objective a particular client is after. If an order were to come in for, say, 12 feet of books about politics, specifically with a progressive or liberal tilt—as one did in August—Wonder Book’s manager, Jessica Bowman, would simply send one of her more politics-savvy staffers to the enormous box labeled “Politically Incorrect” (the name of Books by the Foot’s politics package) to select about 120 books by authors like Hillary Clinton, Bill Maher, Al Franken and Bob Woodward. The books would then be “staged,” or arranged with the same care a florist might extend to a bouquet of flowers, on a library cart; double-checked by a second staffer; and then shipped off to the residence or commercial space where they would eventually be shelved and displayed (or shelved and taken down to read).</td>

      <td>The Vermont socialist still isn’t satisfied with the Biden cabinet.</td>
      <td>Some day Vermont’s Sen. Bernie Sanders may look back on these times as the good old days. By his own admission even most Democrats don’t share his socialist views, yet all Americans are bearing the burden of a rapid expansion of government. So why can’t Mr. Sanders relax and enjoy the moment?<br />With President Donald Trump’s signing of the latest Covid-related spending bill, another $900 billion adds to a federal intervention this year  that was already historic. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) pegs the grand total around $5 trillion. The organization hopefully assumes some economic benefits from the legislation for an optimistic but still staggering net cost of $3.5 trillion over five years.<br />And for some reason, even though vaccines are being distributed, the  economy is growing and employment has increased for seven straight months—for a total of 12 million jobs added since the spring shutdowns—President-elect Joe Biden is still suggesting that much more massive government intervention is required.<br />In October CRFB estimated the Biden agenda would add more than $10 trillion in new spending over a decade (not even counting new Covid spending), partially funded by more than $4 trillion in new taxes. To make it happen Mr. Biden has introduced an economic team of activists largely unblemished by market experience.<br />The Biden program is bound to discourage entrepreneurial creativity. Yet nothing can seem to turn the Sanders frown upside down.</td>

      <td>The alt rock of an earlier decade is influencing artists like Post Malone, Phoebe Bridgers, Taylor Swift and more—many of whom were too young to experience bands like Nirvana and the Goo Goo Dolls firsthand.</td>
      <td><br /><br />On April 24, rapper and singer Post Malone, born Austin Post, strapped on a guitar and stood in front of a camera to perform Nirvana covers for more than an hour. The live-streamed event raised money for Covid relief and was one of the more successful early experiments in providing a concert experience during the lockdown, raising more than $500,000 with 200,000 people watching at one point.<br />Mr. Post’s own music—a spare and low-key hybrid of rap and pop—sounds nothing like Nirvana, but his rendering of the Seattle grunge band’s catalog led to hosannas from former Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, along with Kurt Cobain’s widow, Hole frontwoman Courtney Love. And this was even more notable since Mr. Post, age 25, was born in 1995, the year after Mr. Cobain died by suicide. The live-stream was one highly visible moment among many in 2020 that confirmed how thoroughly ’90s alternative rock—both the heavier and folkier varieties—has now become part of the musical conversation for those who were too young to experience it firsthand.<br />Among the most highly anticipated debut albums of 2020 was “Fake It Flowers” from 20-year-old Filipino-British singer-songwriter Beatrice Laus, who performs as Beabadoobee. In 2019, Ms. Laus released a single called “I Wish I Was Stephen Malkmus,” the frontman of the quintessential ’90s indie rock band Pavement. Her LP transports the thick guitar sound of that decade and its quiet-versus-loud choruses into the present moment. While plenty of indie rock bands have touched on grunge over the years, her record channeled the more accessible end of the genre and imparted a veneer of slickness. “Fake It Flowers” made some year-end lists, was a modest success on its own terms, and offers a glimpse at how the sound of ’90s rock might be integrated into the pop of the future.</td>

In signing the bill, the president called on Congress to increase the size of direct payments to Americans and said he wanted an investigation into alleged voter fraud and the repeal of a law concerning social-media companies.<br />Mr. Trump’s decision to sign the aid bill came after extensive lobbying from Republican lawmakers and advisers, said people familiar with the conversations.<br />Mr. Trump made the final decision Sunday during a phone call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), said a person with knowledge of the talks. But it came after days of consultation with aides and allies, among them former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.<br />Allies argued that blocking the bill could hurt the chances of Republicans running in a Georgia special election on Jan. 5 that will determine control of the Senate. They also urged Mr. Trump to consider his political legacy and encouraged him to sign the bill while still pressing Congress to do more.</td>

One tip in particular, he said, gave investigators a name and led them to places to search for forensic evidence to match to tissue found at the site of the bombing.

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday it has set its first-ever climate standards for commercial airliners and large business jets, aligning U.S. rules with global standards and giving jet makers eight years to comply.<br />The move follows years of momentum internationally to address the airline industry’s contribution to climate change. The sector accounts for about 2% of the global carbon emissions that are warming the planet, according to U.S. data and environmental groups. The EPA first proposed the rule in July while under legal pressure from environmental groups and amid concern from U.S. jet-makers about international sales.<br />The new rules create efficiency standards to limit carbon-dioxide and nitrous-oxide emissions from commercial airliners and large business jets in the U.S. starting in 2028. Aircraft companies have to apply the limits to any new designs starting this year.<br />The core of these regulations adopt metrics established by the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations’ commercial-aviation regulator. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in July that the U.S. aviation industry had made it clear the agency should be adopting those standards to ensure consistency globally.<br />The EPA’s action helps prevent U.S. jets from getting shut out of the international market. U.S. manufacturers export three of every four aircraft they make, the EPA has said, and U.S. companies face the potential of losing those sales if their planes don’t meet international standards.</td>

      <td>PARIS—Three French soldiers were killed in Mali on Monday when their vehicle hit a bomb during operations under France’s counterterrorism mission in the West African nation, the French government said.<br />France has more than 5,000 soldiers deployed in an area spanning thousands of miles from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to Chad in the east. Over the past seven years, the forces have fought branches of Islamic State, al Qaeda and other militant groups, which roam the region’s isolated villages and threaten government forces in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and elsewhere.<br />The soldiers killed Monday were conducting operations around Hombori, a small town in Mali’s central Mopti province, as part of the French military’s Operation Barkhane campaign against Islamist militants across the Sahel region of Africa, authorities said. They identified the soldiers as Tanerii Mauri, Dorian Issakhanian and Quentin Pauchet. The three soldiers were from a military regiment based in the town of Thierville-sur-Meuse in the east of France, they said.<br />Their deaths bring French fatalities to at least 47 soldiers during the current operation and the short operation before it, which began in 2013. That includes an accident in November 2019, when two French helicopters collided during a mission in northern Mali, killing 13 soldiers.<br />The U.S. military has provided key support to the French operation, including drone surveillance and other intelligence-gathering activities. In 2017, Islamist militants killed four U.S. soldiers based in Niger.</td>

      <td>Short pieces from 20 Irish composers, a serial space opera and a trio of works inspired by famous diaries.</td>
      <td><br />With opera gone digital due to the Covid-19 pandemic, fans can experience voices, composers and opera companies they might never otherwise have heard. The Irish National Opera commissioned short (five- to eight-minute) pieces from 20 Irish composers. Recorded in Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and filmed in a lively variety of styles, the resulting “20 Shots of Opera”, available free, is an exhilarating jaunt through up-to-the-minute lyric creativity. Unlike the experience of losing yourself in the lengthy grandeur of more traditional operas, you absorb these intimate quick takes like jolts of recognition.<br />In the opening comedy, “Mrs. Streicher” by Gerald Barry, the best-known of the composers, a tenor sits at a table ranting furiously about servants and laundry, with interjections from a tuba. The text is from Beethoven’s letters. Several pieces explore separation: In Éna Brennan’s “Rupture,” a soprano duels with her inner, critical voice; in Hannah Peel’s “Close,” two women have an awkward first in-person, socially distanced date. One powerful group of works looks at death: In Alex Dowling’s “Her Name,” a sweet-voiced choirboy mourns his mother; Michael Gallen’s “At a Loss” is a large-scale diva turn, as the soprano awaits news of her mother’s death; Andrew Hamilton’s “Erth Upon Erth” is a wordless howl, starting with a woman’s mouth in close-up and ending with her zipped into a body bag on a gurney.<br />Operas made just for film can inspire highly creative visuals. “Verballing” by David Coonan employs black-and-white animation. A female police officer, getting schooled in how to question a murder suspect, sings just one word—“Yeah,” repeated higher and higher. The instructions appear only in type, and as the tension mounts, the background dissolves so that her white face floats in a sea of darkness. In the hilarious “A Message for Marty (or `The Ring’)” by Conor Mitchell, two sisters call out an ex (who dumped one of them by text); the jittery cellphone picture, the tacky costumes, and the escalating fury, plus a snippet of Wagner, is opera extremism in modern dress.<br />Most of the pieces are for women’s voices, exploring different timbres and expressivity. I was struck by the fierce intensity of mezzo Naomi Louisa O’Connell in Emma O’Halloran’s “The Wait,” and the simple, folk-like cadences of Benedict Schlepper-Connolly’s “Dust,” a lament for the natural world, poignantly sung by Michelle O’Rourke. And the insidiously floating and twisting soprano line of “Libris Solar,” sung by Claudia Boyle, made me want to hear something longer from composer Jennifer Walshe.</td>

      <td>I was sworn in as U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey on Jan. 17, 2002. Six days later, Daniel Pearl, South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped in Karachi, Pakistan. Pearl was investigating a story about the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, and had been promised by his kidnappers that they would take him to meet Sheikh Mubarak Ali Gilani. Pearl believed Sheikh Mubarak had information regarding Mr. Reid, the British terrorist who attempted to detonate an explosive device in his shoe aboard a Paris-to-Miami flight in December 2001. Pearl never met Sheikh Mubarak—the meeting was a setup—and he was never seen again. The killers released a videotape of Pearl’s murder.<br />The Pearl investigation was my baptism into the world of terrorism. We were all still reeling from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The FBI had set up a command center at the South Brunswick, N.J., headquarters of Dow Jones, the Journal’s publisher. Through the combined efforts of the Justice Department and Pakistani authorities, three men were identified as having taken part in the abduction. Their organization, the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, had been sending ransom demands to the Dow Jones computer servers in New Jersey. Through great computer forensics, the task force of combined American and Pakistani authorities was able to identify and arrest three people, including the mastermind of the abduction, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh.<br />Mr. Sheikh already had a record of terrorism. In 1994, then a member of Harkat ul-Ansar, an Islamic militant organization, he was convicted of kidnapping four people, including an American in India. He was jailed in India but after his terrorist friends hijacked an Indian Airlines flight, Mr. Sheikh was freed in exchange for the passengers. With assistance from the Taliban, he made his way to Afghanistan.<br />Mr. Sheikh was indicted in March 2002 by a New Jersey grand jury for the kidnapping of Pearl resulting in his murder. The indictment is still viable and it is a case for which the U.S. can seek the death penalty. In announcing the indictment, Attorney General John Ashcroft also announced the unsealing of an indictment charging Mr. Sheikh with the kidnapping of the American tourist in India.<br />Mr. Sheikh and his co-conspirators were also charged in Pakistan. They were tried in 2002 and convicted. While his accomplices were given life sentences, Mr. Sheikh was sentenced to death. His appeal languished until April, when a Pakistani court ordered the release of all the defendants on the grounds that there was conflicting testimony at the original trial and insufficient evidence to support the murder charge. The Pakistani authorities have been fighting the release and have kept Mr. Sheikh jailed. But on Thursday the court again ordered his release.</td>

      <td>Voters who chose him still have faith in public institutions. His goal should be to reassure the rest.</td>
      <td>Many Americans were taken aback when 126 members of Congress joined a specious lawsuit to overturn last month’s presidential election. It appeared to be the latest, most glaring evidence that the country’s commitment to its constitutional system is in decline. But there’s reason for hope. Hyperbolic calls to abandon the core institutions of American life—demands to forsake capitalism from the left, and vicious, norm-busting partisanship from Donald Trump’s Republicans—were defeated handily this year. The result of the presidential election showed that beyond repudiating President Trump, Americans are seeking renewal and revitalization.<br />To be sure, polarization is a real and serious problem. But this election was less about whether the U.S. would tack left or right, and more about whether the country would embrace compassion. Americans rejected the radical vituperation proselytized on the fringes and chose the optimistic tradition of social justice associated with Pope John XXIII. (I know that may sound strange coming from a practicing Jew, but here we are.) The man who decisively defeated Mr. Trump reflects the “silent majority” of Americans, who believe in renewing rather than revolutionizing our political and economic systems. Rooted in faith, Joe Biden’s promise to “save the soul of the nation” reflected his determination to address the political, economic and cultural alienation that fuels fervor on the far right and left alike.<br />Those who feel vindicated by Mr. Biden’s victory shouldn’t lose sight of how we got here—or how we got President Trump four years ago. A significant minority of the country is angry, and their anger is, at root, entirely legitimate. Trump supporters and the far left both sense that in today’s America the powerful few get ahead and don’t see, hear or value everyday people. I realize that people on either edge of the political spectrum naturally take offense at being lumped in with the other lot. But everyone who still champions democratic capitalism—and that’s most of us—needs to realize that the calls for revolution from right and left have a common foundation in grievance and estrangement.<br />Their uproar was a long time coming. Many of today’s radicalized voters come from families who sacrificed when the country went to war over phantom weapons of mass destruction and watched the responsible policy makers get off scot-free. Their communities were decimated by the financial crisis, and banks got bailouts while victims were left holding the bag. Today they struggle to afford college even as celebrities lie and cheat to get their children into elite schools. Over the years they’ve grown to believe that there are two sets of rules in the U.S.—one for the rich and powerful, and one for everyone else. They’re not entirely wrong.<br />But the solution isn’t to blow up the system, ignoring the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box. Nor is it right for proponents of America’s institutions to castigate, shun, cancel or demonize those who have lost faith. Both camps have become ideologically tribal, and Mr. Trump was particularly adept at exploiting the desire to find fellowship in grievance. But the first step in reconciliation or bridging a political divide is to control any impulse to dismiss the other side, and instead reach for mutual understanding. That’s why Americans should adopt Mr. Biden’s belief that everyone counts, that everyone’s voice matters, and that our collective responsibility is to ensure that the country can “grow together.”</td>

      <td>The challenge of modernizing the urban landscape has intensified with the pandemic pressuring public budgets</td>
      <td>Cisco Systems Inc.  is pulling the plug on a flagship effort to help digitize the modern city, the latest example of a big tech company struggling to enter a new market.<br />The setback comes as the pandemic has weighed on Cisco’s core business of supplying networking equipment and has limited the ability of local governments to finance such projects.<br />City planners and local governments for years have been preparing for a future where technology remakes the urban landscape, with features such as self-driving cars, smart lighting and connected alarms to help safeguard residents. Communications using 5G technology blanketing the city would allow widespread adoption of smart devices.<br />For Cisco, best known for providing routers and other networking gear to corporate customers, that vision promised a budding new market. And the effort, built largely around the company’s Cisco Kinetic for Cities software services, became a high-profile initiative for Chief Executive Chuck Robbins as he tried to transform Cisco from a hardware vendor into a company more closely associated with the lucrative business of selling software services.<br />Now Cisco is moving on. “We recently decided to stop sales and eventually support [for] the Cisco Kinetic for City product line to align our product investment to evolving market needs and customer requirements,” a company spokesman told The Wall Street Journal.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—The families of a group of Hong Kong activists who were detained fleeing the city in a speedboat in August called on Chinese authorities to issue verdicts soon after they were tried in a mainland court.<br />Four hours after a closed-door hearing started Monday, the Yantian District Court in Shenzhen said the trials of 10 of the activists had ended and the verdicts would be announced at another time.<br />“I want to see my son. I won’t be able to see him if you don’t decide,” said the mother of one of the defendants, Wong Wai-yin. The mother has asked not to be identified by name.<br />The fate of those detained—who have been dubbed the Hong Kong 12 by supporters calling for their release—has drawn international attention and become a central issue for pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.<br />The 10 charged are accused of illegal border crossing, which carries a one-year sentence. Two of the 10 are also accused of organizing the attempted escape and are potentially facing longer prison terms. Two others on the boat weren’t charged because they were under the age of 18, but they will be subject to a hearing, the families said they were told.</td>

      <td>Latest shot will become the fifth to enter final-stage testing in the U.S., and if results are positive it could receive authorization sometime during 2021</td>
      <td>Novavax Inc.  said Monday it is starting a new clinical trial of up to 30,000 people in the U.S. and Mexico to test whether its experimental Covid-19 vaccine safely protects people from the disease.<br />Novavax’s shot will become the fifth Covid-19 vaccine to enter final-stage testing in the U.S., and if results are positive it could receive authorization sometime during 2021. Public-health officials say that despite the introduction of the first two Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S., additional vaccines will be needed to meet demand and control the pandemic.<br />“We’ve come this far, this fast, but we need to get to the finish line,” said Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, which is helping to fund the Novavax study. “That will require multiple vaccines using different approaches to ensure everyone is protected safely and effectively from this deadly disease.”<br />The company didn’t say when it expects to generate results from the new study, but it will likely be spring at the earliest. Studies of the first two vaccines from  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  took nearly four months for results to become available.<br />U.S. regulators authorized emergency use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines this month. Large U.S. studies of two more vaccines, from  Johnson & Johnson  and from  AstraZeneca  PLC and Oxford University, could yield results and potential authorizations by February, federal officials said recently.</td>

      <td>Hypnosis, now going virtual, is gaining more acceptance from doctors, researchers and entrepreneurs. But potential patients remain skeptical.</td>
      <td>Kelley Cutler was deeply skeptical when she took part in a monthlong pilot test of Reveri Health, a new digital hypnosis program, at Stanford University last year. The San Francisco social worker needed help quitting smoking, and only joined the program at her doctor’s urging.<br />“I was thinking it was nonsense and was never going to work,” says Ms. Cutler, 44, who had smoked for 25 years. Her first hypnosis session, which took place in person with a clinician, was so anxiety-producing that she had to have a cigarette afterward.<br />Reveri Health, one of a new generation of hypnosis programs and apps that make the practice easily accessible at home, then required her to take part in interactive, self-hypnosis sessions at home for a month. After two of the digital sessions, she was shocked to discover that she no longer felt like smoking. “The craving was really gone,” she says. “I can’t explain it. It doesn’t make sense.”<br />She hasn’t had a cigarette since. “This hypnosis is some crazy-ass voodoo,” she says. “And I mean that in a good way.”<br />Hypnosis is no longer considered crazy in the medical field, doctors say, but many patients, like Ms. Cutler, are leery. The practice has increasingly gained acceptance in the medical community, and in the last two years, the research into how and why it works has accelerated, with new studies on the use of hypnosis to alleviate anxiety; ward off pain; and successfully inhibit the fear circuitry structures in the brain.</td>
