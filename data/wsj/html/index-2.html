      <td>SINGAPORE—ByteDance Ltd., the owner of popular short-video app TikTok, said Thursday founder and global chief executive officer Zhang Yiming would step down from his role to focus on long-term strategy, and appointed co-founder Liang Rubo to take his place.<br />Mr. Zhang’s departure comes as Chinese tech companies have come under growing pressure from a regulatory crackdown on monopolistic practices, and after the Chinese short-video company was caught in the crosshairs of U.S.-China geopolitical tensions last year.<br />His resignation follows an internal executive shake-up in April when Shou Zi Chew, ByteDance’s chief financial officer, was named CEO of TikTok.<br />ByteDance, which counts the  Carlyle Group  and Sequoia Capital among its backers, is one of China’s most valuable startups. Mr. Liang is the head of human resources and management at ByteDance. A graduate of Nankai University, the same college that Mr. Zhang attended, he also founded a different startup with Mr. Zhang before they started ByteDance together in 2012.<br />“I believe I can best challenge the limits of what the company can achieve over the next decade, and drive innovation, by drawing on my strengths of highly-focused learning, systematic thought, and a willingness to attempt new things,” Mr. Zhang said in a letter to employees on Thursday, posted online by the company.</td>

      <td>Software giant’s web browser to join other early internet mainstays like AOL Instant Messenger on the digital scrap heap</td>
      <td>Microsoft Corp.  said it plans to largely retire its Internet Explorer browser, adding to the digital scrap heap a product once at the center of one of the tech industry’s biggest battles.<br />The software giant on Wednesday said its Internet Explorer 11 desktop application, the current version, will no longer be supported starting June 15 of next year for certain versions of the company’s Windows software. Microsoft’s browser push now is centered on Edge, which it launched in 2015, and shares underlying technology with Chrome.<br />Internet Explorer has faded gradually from prominence as rival browsers such as Chrome from  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google unit and Safari from  Apple Inc.  have won audiences. Internet Explorer had less than 2% of the global browser market for desktop computers in April, according to web analytics firm Statcounter. Chrome had more than 65% of that market, ahead of Safari’s roughly 10%. Microsoft Edge had 8%, according to the data.<br />Internet Explorer joins other big names from the early days of the internet era to transition from digital reality to corporate history after being overtaken by others. AOL Instant Messenger was retired in 2017 after users flocked to platforms such as  Facebook Inc.’s  WhatsApp. Two years later, Tumblr, the microblogging site turned social-media network, was sold for a pittance after being overtaken by Facebook and others.  BlackBerry Ltd. , the company that popularized mobile email and whose devices became a must have for many in business, stopped selling its own devices after Apple’s success with the iPhone and other smartphones caught on. It still provides security software for phones and other devices.<br />More than two decades ago, Internet Explorer was riding high—perhaps too high to some. It featured prominently in the browser battle of roughly 20 years ago and in the U.S. government’s antitrust battle against Microsoft. A federal judge ruled that Microsoft maintained its monopoly in operating-systems software by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the web-browser market by unlawfully tying its Internet Explorer browser to its Windows operating-system software. The practice caused the use of Netscape Navigator, once a dominant browser, “to drop substantially” from 1995 to 1998, the judge wrote. Microsoft in 2001 reached a settlement with the Justice Department over its allegations, without admitting wrongdoing.</td>

      <td>Countries don’t want to punish themselves to rescue bad U.S. policy.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration hopes a new global minimum corporate tax will dampen the blow of its tax increases on the U.S. economy. But other governments are making it clearer by the day that they won’t play along.<br />Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has thrown herself enthusiastically into negotiations at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to write such a global tax regime. President Biden wants to impose a form of alternative minimum tax on corporate profits earned overseas, with a statutory rate of 21% and an effective rate that’s higher for many companies. Even the progressives manning the Biden barricades realize this will throttle U.S. competitiveness if other countries don’t impose similar taxes.<br />Ms. Yellen might have thought long-running OECD negotiations toward a global minimum tax would be an easy way to achieve this goal. Instead, European governments are adopting a version of Napoleon’s maxim: Never interrupt Washington while it’s harming itself.<br />One problem is the rate the OECD will propose for its own version of a minimum tax. The talks seem most likely to settle near 12%-13%, close to Ireland’s current corporate tax rate. That’s far below the rate Mr. Biden wants to apply to American companies, and European governments are aware of the competitive benefits of lower rates.<br />Officials in Ireland, Hungary and the Czech Republic—all of whom will have to agree to an OECD proposal before the European Union can adopt it—have said recently an OECD rate of 21% would be unacceptably high.</td>

      <td>A new ad campaign targets Nike, Coca-Cola and American Airlines.</td>
      <td>Some of America’s most prominent CEOs have been getting political, as in woke political, and perhaps they figured it was cost-free. They are now learning the hard way that it isn’t, as a national advertising campaign targets their brands and credibility.<br />The campaign launched Tuesday by Consumers’ Research, a conservative nonprofit, takes aim at  Nike ,   Coca-Cola  and American Airlines. But others could be the targets, says Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research. The 30-second spots will air on national cable news, as well as “in local markets where the companies are headquartered,” the nonprofit said. One source says the overall ad buy could be up to $13 million.<br />Each ad treats the companies like a political candidate would an opponent, hitting the company’s reputation and contrasting its high-minded social-justice rhetoric with its other behavior. Nike embraced Colin Kaepernick, the woke former quarterback, one ad says, but “rather than hiring Americans, Nike chose China.” The ad mentions CEO John Donahoe and claims the company produced shoes in a factory and regions suspected of using forced Uyghur labor.<br />Nike says its code of conduct prohibits “any type of prison, forced, bonded or indentured labor” and that it has no evidence “of employment of Uyghurs, or other ethnic minorities” from Xinjiang in it supply chain.<br />Another ad calls out Coca-Cola and CEO James Quincey for opposing Georgia’s voting law. It highlights the beverage company’s contribution to obesity.</td>

      <td>In Pennsylvania, a rebuke to Gov. Tom Wolf’s diktats.</td>
      <td>Americans nationwide are tired of endless pandemic diktats, and in Pennsylvania on Tuesday they showed it with a resounding electoral rebuke of Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s emergency powers.<br />Mr. Wolf has rivaled New York’s Andrew Cuomo in proving again that absolute power corrupts even elected officials absolutely. The Keystone State Governor declared his initial 90-day virus emergency in March 2020. It’s still in effect, and the latest extension takes it through Thursday.<br />Mr. Wolf regulated private gatherings and shut down any business he didn’t deem “life-sustaining.” In September a federal court said Pennsylvania’s rules violated the U.S. Constitution. The judge found that the state “never had a set definition in writing for what constituted a ‘life-sustaining’ business,” and it stopped giving out waivers “largely because of an overwhelming number of requests.”<br />The Republican Legislature tried to tweak the rules, passing a bill to let business open under Covid mitigation measures. Mr. Wolf vetoed it. Then the Legislature passed a resolution to terminate the emergency. Lawmakers argued they could act unilaterally and bypass a veto, but Mr. Wolf disagreed, and the state Supreme Court took his side. The emergency stayed.<br />Voters finally rode to the rescue Tuesday with a pair of state constitutional amendments that will restore a healthier separation of powers. One limits the Governor’s emergency declarations to 21 days, unless the Legislature extends them. That passed 53% to 47%, according to the latest tally.</td>

      <td>Democrats learned from Jeremy Corbyn’s defeat that they needed a veneer of moderation.</td>
      <td>What is the aftermath of the political earthquake that shook both sides of the Atlantic in 2016? In the U.K. and then the U.S.—with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump—voters broke with establishment orthodoxies, upset old coalitions and reset their political landscapes in the form of conservative populism. Yet nearly five years on, political developments in the two countries have diverged sharply.<br />On May 6, Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party scored significant victories in local council elections, gaining more than 200 seats across England for a net increase of control over 13 councils, mostly at the expense of the rival Labour Party. In a closely watched by-election in Hartlepool for a parliamentary seat held by Labour since 1974, the Conservatives prevailed, adding to their gains behind Labour’s “red wall” in working-class areas of Northern England.<br />To be sure, there was nuance to the election results. The Scottish National Party increased its plurality in the Scottish Parliament by one seat. Labour performed well in Wales and returned London Mayor Sadiq Khan to office. Still, particularly given the onerous lockdowns for which they could easily be blamed, the Conservatives look strong.<br />Contrast this with the U.S. and the power now wielded by the American left. Again, there is nuance. Congress leans Democratic by the slimmest of margins. Republicans enjoy majorities in state legislatures and governorships. The fact nonetheless remains: While Mr. Johnson and the Conservatives have bolstered their position in the U.K., Democrats wrested national power from the victors of 2016, and they are using it, with the assistance of an obsequious media, to push trillions of dollars in new spending and a transformative, radical agenda.<br />Why did the story of 2016 take such different turns in the two countries? The U.K.’s 2019 general election helps furnish an answer. In his campaign, Mr. Johnson asked the British electorate to endorse his plan for a “clean” Brexit and for the numbers to end the gridlock of a hopelessly divided House of Commons. By contrast, the Labour Party, under socialist Jeremy Corbyn, promised more division and strife in the form of a second Brexit referendum. Mr. Corbyn also promised an overtly radical governing agenda: big new spending with massive tax increases and an ideologically driven, hard-left foreign policy. Government under Mr. Corbyn, the electorate was told, would nationalize rail and utilities, provide “free” university education, and much more. As the Labour leader proudly stated, his campaign manifesto offered “the most radical and ambitious plan to transform our country for decades.”</td>

      <td>Wedged between Iran and China, the Afghanistan location can’t be beat.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration’s decision to remove all U.S. forces from Afghanistan could cost the country an important strategic asset, the Bagram Air Base. For years, the base has been conducting tactical air operations in support of American and Afghan troops. Bagram is 40 miles north of Kabul and is impressive in size: The installation covers about 30 square miles. Its 12,000-foot runway can accommodate U.S. military aircraft of any size.<br />The location is also strategic, to say the least: Bagram is about 400 miles west of China and about 500 miles east of Iran. This is a good place to have American assets. Keeping the base open could hardly be called a provocation, given it’s been around for years. But manning this base requires a continued military presence in Afghanistan, which would also ensure the country doesn’t return to being a base for terrorists.<br />All of this is reason to oppose removing all U.S. troops. The better course would be keeping enough troops in the country to maintain Bagram and support for Afghan troops in resisting the Taliban.<br />There is a good reason why the Taliban wants Americans completely out of Afghanistan. As long as the U.S. keeps troops there and supports the Afghan government, the Taliban won’t prevail, even if they take over much of the country, which would hardly be easy. American troops can provide training and air support without engaging in ground combat. Anything the Taliban agrees to for the purpose of ensuring complete withdrawal, such as breaking ties with al Qaeda in the landmark 2020 agreement, is never to be taken seriously. The Taliban knows it can never be completely successful as long as there are U.S. military personnel in the country.<br />The U.S. has been in Afghanistan since 2001. That may seem a long time to many. We have, however, been heavily involved with South Korea since 1950. Even though that country is far more important to national security than is Afghanistan, President Jimmy Carter tried to bring troops home from South Korea in 1977. Widespread bureaucratic resistance to the idea prevented it from happening.</td>

      <td>Both parties draw maps with an eye toward power, but Eric Holder and Barack Obama pretend that Democrats don’t.</td>
      <td>Former Attorney General Eric Holder and President Barack Obama have covered the National Democratic Redistricting Committee—formed by Mr. Holder in January 2017 and joined by Mr. Obama in December 2018—with the rhetoric of righteousness. They claim to oppose “extreme partisan gerrymandering” and are pushing for redistricting reform because, according to the former president, it’s an “opportunity to bend the great arc of history toward justice.”<br />Messrs. Obama and Holder want to leave the impression they genuinely seek “fair maps and more representative democracy” and aren’t simply prettying up a partisan power grab. But do they criticize Democratic redistricting hijinks? So far, they haven’t. And I bet they won’t.<br />Take Illinois, which will lose one of its 18 seats under redistricting run by Messrs. Obama and Holder’s party. Democrats are circulating a map that’d likely take the delegation from 13 Democrats and 5 Republicans to 14 Democrats and 3 Republicans. GOP Rep. Adam Kitzinger’s district would be split among adjacent ones while two Republicans, Rodney Davis and Mary Miller, would be paired. A new downstate Democratic seat would be created by linking strongholds in East St. Louis, Decatur, Springfield and Champaign-Urbana in a district that resembles a snake digesting four pigs.<br />This seems particularly unfair when you consider that though Republicans won 41% of the votes in Illinois’s 2020 congressional races, they only hold 28% of the seats. And now the Democrats want to knock that down to 18%. Yet not a peep of protest from Messrs. Obama or Holder about these shenanigans.<br />Then there’s New York. Census data cut it to 26 seats from 27—but Democrats are manhandling the process. Voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2014 creating a 10-member bipartisan commission to prepare maps and set standards, including an explicit requirement that districts “not be drawn . . . to favor/disfavor candidates or parties.” The legislature can reject the commission’s plans, but only by a two-thirds vote, and may produce its own plans only after rejecting two such commission maps.</td>

      <td>Boxed in by censorship rules and isolated on distant shores, correspondents struggled to bring grim reality to the public they served.</td>
      <td>Although celebrity correspondents have been writing since the time of Aeschylus, the immense scope of World War II ignited an explosion of rock stars with typewriters. Ernest Hemingway, who drank, loved and fought his way through France and Germany, remains the heavyweight champ of war-reporter fame, but others proved more influential. CBS News’s Edward R. Murrow became so respected during the London Blitz that several journalism awards and a university center are named for him. Walter Cronkite, a guest on bombing runs over Germany, became the most trusted man in America. Photojournalist Robert Capa immortalized D-Day’s terrors through the lens of a Zeiss camera.<br />These men cemented their reputations in Europe. The Pacific War, by contrast, with its strange names, oceanic expanses and appalling hardships, was a theater where a reporter’s voice could be lost amid war’s roar. Few writers became household names. Boxed in by tight censorship rules and isolated on distant shores, Pacific War correspondents struggled to bring war’s grim reality to the public they served.<br />Steven Casey’s “The War Beat, Pacific” recounts the toils of the Americans behind the dispatches on the long road from Pearl Harbor to Tokyo Bay. Beginning with the reflexive shroud of censorship that fell over the nation on Dec. 7, 1941, Mr. Casey describes an uneasy triangle among the military brass, the war reporters and their newspaper editors back home. At the senior level, “War Beat” presents leaders like Gen. Douglas MacArthur and the U.S. Navy’s chief, Adm. Ernest King, in a conventional light. The vainglorious MacArthur “always enjoyed seeing his name in print,” while the tight-lipped King would have preferred to release no information except to announce Japan’s surrender.<br />In the dark days of December 1941, MacArthur issued wildly optimistic communiqués, and his headquarters, starved for victories, pressured correspondents to toe the general’s line. After one Japanese bombing raid on Manila, for instance,a group of correspondents “saw burning wooden shacks, dead civilians, and indescribable damage to vital military installations,” Mr. Casey notes. “But when it came time to write up their stories, they willingly followed MacArthur’s lead and focused on the U.S. response.”<br />While the Army and Marines gave reporters unprecedented access to the front lines in the war’s early months, getting to the scene of battle could be surprisingly difficult. “Reporters could hear the shouts of ‘banzai’ or the sniper and artillery fire,” Mr. Casey explains, “but they rarely got more than a fleeting glimpse of enemy soldiers until after the fighting was over.” Even understanding the outcome of a battle proved challenging. After the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944—the war’s largest naval battle, supporting MacArthur’s invasion of the Philippines—most ship-based correspondents “headed for dry land as soon as the invasion succeeded,” Mr. Casey writes, “and so had only the vaguest notion of what was happening out at sea.”</td>

Say these words: “law and order.” Aaaaagh!<br />Everyone loves “Law and Order”—as a TV series. As real life, law and order, also known as the crime issue, doesn’t exist in the Democratic mind. It’s never a problem. Until it is. On Monday, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered 250 cops into the subways to battle rampant crime on the trains and platforms.<br />When Mr. de Blasio was elected mayor in 2013, he inherited decades of urban calm from Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Mike Bloomberg and their anticrime police commissioners, Bill Bratton and Ray Kelly. One of the biggest issues in the 2013 campaign was whether to ban horse-drawn carriages in Central Park.<br />Eight years later, the Democratic primary race to succeed Mr. de Blasio is suddenly about those three Democratic denial words: law and order. The June 22 primary effectively selects the next mayor.<br />New Yorkers have spent the past year beaten down both by Covid and crime. For Covid they’ve got vaccinations. For the city’s epidemic of shootings, up over last year by some 80%, they’ve got nearly nothing. In a city brimming with progressive politicians and street activists, the police have been targeted as the enemy.</td>

Discovery shares have fallen about 16% since the start of trading on Monday, shortly after the deal was unveiled. The options are currently trading out of the money, meaning the share price would need to rise over the next eight years for Mr. Zaslav to profit from exercising them.<br />On Tuesday, Discovery said it had entered into a new, seven-year employment agreement on unspecified terms with Mr. Zaslav, who is expected to head up the combined company.<br />A Discovery spokesman confirmed that the options stemmed from the new contract, which was approved by the board on Sunday along with the broader AT&T transaction.

      <td>Around 8,000 migrants illegally entered Ceuta, a Spanish swath of territory bordering Morocco on the North African coast, beginning on Monday, taking Spanish authorities by surprise.<br />Spain sent in the army and more police forces to tighten border controls and then began a mass expulsion of those who entered, among them families and minors.<br />The influx happened at a time of heightened tensions between Spain and Morocco over the Spanish government’s decision to allow the leader of a northern African independence group to seek treatment for Covid-19 in Spain.<br />Many migrants from Africa try to reach Europe by the same route in search of a better life, although the number of migrants this week was unusually high.<br />Most of the migrants were young men, but Spanish authorities said they also included families and some unaccompanied minors. The most were Moroccans. The migrants entered illegally by sea, either swimming or using small boats to navigate around a breakwater that marks the border between Spanish Ceuta and Morocco.</td>

They fell through the afternoon and closed at $43.65. In a prospectus about the offering, the company had said it raised about $300 million in March by selling stock in a private deal for roughly $68.42 a share.<br />At the end of its first day, the stock market valued Squarespace at roughly $5.9 billion based on roughly 136 million shares outstanding. The stock also spent most of the day below the so-called reference price of $50 set by the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday as a guidepost for trading.<br />U.S. stocks traded lower Wednesday, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all down for the day, though the losses weren’t as bad at the closing bell as they were earlier in the session.<br />Anthony Casalena, founder and chief executive, said that he didn’t try to time the market and that the debut isn’t just about one day.</td>

President Biden also supports the commission, which needs a simple majority in the House and 60 votes to advance in the 50-50 Senate before coming to his desk for his signature.</td>

      <td>The actor, who died last week at the age of 106, worked with Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock and Robin Williams.</td>
      <td><br /><br />Most of the obituaries for Norman Lloyd, who died last week at the astonishing age of 106, led with the same two items: He fell off the Statue of Liberty in Alfred Hitchcock’s “Saboteur” and was one of the stars of “St. Elsewhere,” an NBC series about a rundown Boston hospital that ranked among the finest TV dramas of the ’80s (or ever, truth be told). They also made prominent mention of the sheer length of his career, which began on stage in 1932 and ended in Hollywood with “Trainwreck,” an Amy Schumer comedy that came out in 2015, the year he turned 100. No other stage or screen actor is known to have worked to a greater age.<br />In between, he worked with, among countless other notables, Judd Apatow, Ingrid Bergman, Bertolt Brecht, Charlie Chaplin, John Houseman, Burt Lancaster, Jean Renoir, Martin Scorsese, Orson Welles and Robin Williams. Late in life he gave anecdote-rich interviews to relative youngsters like TCM’s Ben Mankiewicz and the New Yorker’s Alex Ross who were agog at the friends he’d made and the things he’d done. Mr. Ross, who spoke to Mr. Lloyd in 2015, described him as “staggeringly undiminished by age.”<br />How did he pull it off? To begin with, Mr. Lloyd fulfilled the Prime Directive of Stage and Screen Longevity: Don’t die. Unlike Welles, who lived a profligate life in every sense of the word and predeceased his old friend and colleague by 36 years, he was a temperate man blessed with a long and happy marriage (his wife died in 2011 at the age of 98) who played tennis twice a week well into his hundredth year.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve officials are debating ways they could tame money-market volatility the next time it flares, including with a tool known as a standing repo facility, minutes from their April policy meeting show.<br />The tool would allow eligible firms to borrow cash from the central bank in exchange for Treasurys used as collateral. Supporters of such a facility see it as a way for firms to quickly obtain dollar liquidity without having to sell Treasury securities, which can create market disruptions if the selling is large enough.<br />“Nearly all participants commented that a standing repo facility, by acting as a backstop, could help address pressures in the markets for U.S. Treasury securities and Treasury repo that could spill over to other funding markets and impair the implementation and transmission of monetary policy,” the minutes released Wednesday said.<br />“Many participants noted that a standing facility could provide a timely and automatic response to incipient market pressures; they remarked that such pressures can be difficult to anticipate and, as a result, might not be as promptly addressed with discretionary operations,” the minutes also said.<br />The language in the minutes suggests Fed support for the tool has grown since the days before the pandemic. Fed officials had been weighing adopting it, but the debate fizzled before the pandemic took hold in the U.S.</td>

By that night, the company’s chief executive officer came to a difficult conclusion: He had to pay.<br />Joseph Blount, CEO of Colonial Pipeline Co., told The Wall Street Journal that he authorized the ransom payment of $4.4 million because executives were unsure how badly the cyberattack had breached its systems, and consequently, how long it would take to bring the pipeline back.<br />Mr. Blount acknowledged publicly for the first time that the company had paid the ransom, saying it was an option he felt he had to exercise, given the stakes involved in a shutdown of such critical energy infrastructure. The Colonial Pipeline provides roughly 45% of the fuel for the East Coast, according to the company.<br />“I know that’s a highly controversial decision,” Mr. Blount said in his first public remarks since the crippling hack. “I didn’t make it lightly. I will admit that I wasn’t comfortable seeing money go out the door to people like this.”<br />“But it was the right thing to do for the country,” he added.</td>

      <td>Especially popular among 20- and 30-somethings, this aesthetic, which combines vintage charm with modern flair, ushers in a new look for patios</td>
      <td>Since it was first christened in 2019, the “grandmillennial” interiors aesthetic has flourished in the homes of design-forward 20- and 30-somethings who embrace passed-down furnishings. Elements include mixed patterns, vintage furniture and unabashed ornament.<br />Now designers say clients, even beyond the throwback-loving set, want to see the look in their outdoor spaces. London interior designer Stephanie Barba Mendoza noted that a garden serves the style’s elaborate flourishes well. “Nature will never feel overwhelming, so it’s a safe space to go all out,” she said.<br />The design of this season’s outdoor collections signals the shift. Business & Pleasure’s Premium Beach Umbrella in Chinoiserie (below), combines undulating contrast fringe with a surprising blue-and-white underside. Wicker predominates, but not in the form of blocky low sectionals. Grandmillennial style calls for lighter classic shapes accompanied by sunny-hued upholstery. A tablecloth from Nordic home-textiles brand Projektityyny features a grandmillennial hat trick: gingham, a ruffle and floral embroidery. The goal, said New York designer Lilse McKenna, is décor that feels “layered and collected” rather than “ordered and delivered.”<br />Adding contemporary components, like a more modern fabric print, to the mix can save a patio from appearing simply mummified. They help ensure grandmillennial spaces don’t read like an estate sale, said Chicago designer Kara Mann. As 1stDibs editorial director Anthony Barzilay Freund advised, referring to the 20th-century American interior designer known as the prince of chintz, “Think Mario Buatta if he’d spent some time hanging with Brooklyn hipsters.”<br />In a newly completed lanai in Naples, Fla., for example, Chicago designer Summer Thornton positioned wicker porch chairs around a dining table set with a golden floral cloth, brass palm-tree candlesticks and hand-painted glassware (above). But to offset the old-school aesthetic, Ms. Thornton brought in trending textiles nearby: “We went for a Batik-inspired African-print sun cloth on two huge sofas,” she said. The effect is 1940s Florida for a younger generation.</td>

      <td>The Federal Reserve has begun to telegraph an eventual shift away from the easy-money policies implemented during the pandemic as evidence builds of a robust economic recovery and mounting inflation.<br />Several Fed officials said this week that the central bank is closely watching economic developments and will be ready to adjust policy when necessary. Minutes from the central bank’s policy meeting in late April, released Wednesday, reported that some Fed officials want to begin discussing a plan for reducing the Fed’s massive bond-buying program at a future meeting.<br />“If we got to the point where we were comfortable on the public health side that the pandemic was largely behind us, and was not going to resurge in some way that was surprising, then I think we could talk about adjusting monetary policy,” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told reporters after a speech Wednesday. “I don’t think we’re quite to that point yet, but it does seem like we’re getting close.”<br />Mr. Bullard doesn’t currently vote on the Fed’s policy-setting committee, but his remarks were echoed by other officials who do.<br />Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, a voting member of the Fed’s rate-setting committee, made similar remarks in a Bloomberg television interview.</td>

Bitcoin, they wagered, might even fulfill its initial vision and become a legitimate alternative currency.<br />But the same momentum that drove prices higher is now sending them relentlessly lower.<br />Bitcoin, which traded around $7,000 at the beginning of 2020, peaked at $64,829 in mid-April. Since then, it has fallen 40% to $38,802, including Wednesday’s 10% decline. Earlier in the day, it dropped as much as 30% to $30,202.</td>

      <td>He treats a Russian gas pipeline better than he does the Keystone XL in America.</td>
      <td>President Biden has talked tough about Vladimir Putin, but his policy response has been mixed. This week’s sanctions decision on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline provides more reason for concern.<br />Axios reported Tuesday that the State Department will send a report to Congress listing entities that should face sanctions over their association with the $11 billion gas pipeline. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at his confirmation hearing that he was “determined to do whatever we can” to stop the project. Turns out that’s not entirely true.<br />While the Biden Administration wants to target Russian ships working on the nearly complete pipeline, the company running the project and its CEO won’t face sanctions. State will recognize that Nord Stream 2 AG and its leader—a former East German intelligence officer—deserve to be sanctioned. Yet restrictions on a Putin crony will be waived in the name of “U.S. national interests.” This is the kind of move that prompted the media to assert that Donald Trump must be a Russian agent.<br />The decision suggests Mr. Biden doesn’t want to blow up his relationship with the German government, which strongly supports the pipeline. But this gets it backward. The project generates bipartisan opposition in the U.S., and in April the European Parliament called for it to be stopped. Germans have the responsibility to avoid damaging relations with Washington and the rest of the Continent.<br />The pipeline will provide cheap energy but deepen European dependence on Russian gas. This is geopolitical malpractice given the threat posed by Moscow’s revisionist foreign policy. It’s also an economic reward to Mr. Putin, who continues to crack down on dissidents, imprison Alexei Navalny, and threaten his neighbors’ sovereignty. That’s why countries like Poland are willing to pay a premium to avoid Russian gas, even if they’re significantly less wealthy than Germany.</td>

      <td>Quibi may be dead, but the mountain of shows the short-lived, short-form streaming service commissioned have found a new home on the Roku Channel, the free, ad-supported streaming service. Roku snapped up more than 75 of the shows originally made for Quibi, renamed them Roku Originals and is making 30 of them available Thursday. They include “Die Hart” (Kevin Hart, John Travolta), “#FreeRayshawn” (Laurence Fishburne, Stephan James) “Most Dangerous Game” (Liam Hemsworth), and reboots of “Reno 911!” and “Punk’d.”<br />Here’s what else is streaming this week:<br />(Netflix)<br />When “Master of None” premiered on Netflix in 2015, the series was squarely about co-creator Aziz Ansari’s character, Dev, a 30-something struggling to find his footing in both work and love. But when the series returns Sunday for its third season—called “Master of None Presents: Moments in Love”—Dev will be a supporting character. The five-episode season focuses on Lena Waithe’s Denise, Dev’s friend with whom, as depicted in season 2, he spent Thanksgivings growing up.<br />In the new season, Denise has the things she thinks she’s wanted. She is now a married, best-selling author with a large, beautiful home in the country. As her marriage falls apart, she begins to rethink her priorities.</td>

      <td>Regarding Daniel Henninger’s “Is the Work Ethic Dying?” (Wonder Land, May 13): The work ethic is being strangled by government. Why work when your tax dollars flow to those who don’t? I paid off my student loans for undergraduate and law school, as well as those of my wife so she could raise our children, and I invested in 529 plans so my children wouldn’t have to borrow for college. Now I’m paying off other people’s student loans. I bought real property in the bubble run-up, and was encouraged by lenders and others to take more risk, which I declined. But others took the risk, and I wound up helping to pay their debt. My tax money went to the savings and loan disaster as well. Now my tax money pays people not to work. On the evidence, can you blame people for not working?<br />Martin Connor<br />Bettendorf, Iowa<br /><br />While economists are divided on the efficacy of stimulus policies, one of the main arguments Keynesian economists employ in their favor is “hysteresis”—the idea that recessions, if left unchecked, will leave permanent scars on the economy. People who lose their jobs during a downturn, the theory argues, won’t only experience erosion of skills, but may also experience an adverse change in their attitude toward work. The longer one is unemployed, the more lasting these scars.</td>

      <td>The Renewable Fuel Standard deserves credit for reducing pump prices and saving Americans billions each year.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “The Ethanol Gasoline Tax” (May 15): The 16-year-old law requiring oil refiners to blend renewable fuels with gasoline has nothing to do with recent higher gas prices. In fact, because ethanol extends fuel supplies and is cheaper than gasoline, the Renewable Fuel Standard deserves credit for reducing pump prices and saving Americans billions each year.<br />But like a gambler betting on the come, some refiners have refused to blend ethanol in the hope that political allies would bail them out of their legal obligation to do so. That high-stakes gambit worked under the last administration, as EPA head Scott Pruitt improperly granted blending “exemptions” to one-third of U.S. refineries. Those waivers devastated the corn market and resulted in billions of gallons of lost demand.<br />But now the courts and Biden administration are calling the refiners’ bluff and finally requiring them to comply with the law. Refiners comply by blending their proportional share of renewable fuel or by buying compliance credits (“RINs”) from parties who blend more than required. As you note, only those refiners “that don’t meet their quotas” must buy RINs. But that’s their prerogative. RIN prices reflect the cost of choosing not to blend ethanol. Still, economists conclude the net effect on the price of E10 gasoline of high RIN prices is zero.<br />So, here is some friendly advice to refiners: Blend enough ethanol to meet your obligation and you won’t need to buy RINs. That’s because each ethanol gallon comes with a free RIN attached. Problem solved.<br />In any case, everyone knows the real driver of pump prices is crude-oil costs, which have doubled since this time last year.</td>

In addition to being EMTs and (more often) paramedics, these full-time, professional lifeguards are experts in ocean, surf, swift-water, boat, scuba and cliff rescue techniques. They train and coordinate with local, county and state agencies in disaster response for a number of scenarios, from flooding to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear events. Each year they manage and train hundreds of ocean lifeguard personnel, who risk their own lives to ensure those of beachgoers. Under their guidance, the Los Angeles and Orange County beaches draw tens of millions of visitors a year, often without even a single guarded drowning.

It was the ninth time this month that India has recorded more than 4,000 deaths in a single day.<br />The rising death toll comes following a surge in cases that rose faster than any the world had previously seen, overwhelming the country’s healthcare system, with hospitals turning patients away and running short of beds, oxygen and Covid-19 medications.<br />Crematoriums too were running short of space and wood.

The cross-border clashes are the worst since the 2014 Gaza war.<br />Some of the first rockets were aimed at Jerusalem, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a red line. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have launched thousands of rockets toward Israel, which has responded with aerial and artillery attacks. Israel says it has killed at least 130 operatives of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group. The operation has exacted a heavy civilian toll.</td>

      <td>As anti-production policies take hold, supply and worker shortages appear and inflation looms.</td>
      <td>The April Consumer Price Index rose by 0.8%, or 9.6% on an annualized basis. On an annual basis the inflation rate for the past three months has been 7.2% and 6.2% for the first four months of 2021. The core inflation rate, excluding food and energy, on an annual basis rose in April by 11%, a rate not exceeded since June of 1982. While the price increases are significant, broad and accelerating, are they the temporary effects of demand recovering from the pandemic shutdown more quickly than production, or is there evidence that this is the return of the inflation that plagued us for a generation and we paid such a high price to escape 40 years ago?<br />As traditionally understood, inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. While it may seem old-fashioned to ask in this brave new world of modern monetary theory, where Joe Biden declared last year that “Milton Friedman isn’t running the show anymore,” is there reason to be concerned that the broad money supply, M2, grew by 24.6% over the last year, a postwar high? That’s more than twice the rate it grew in 1978 before inflation reached 13.4% in 1979 and almost three times the rate it grew amid the “guns and butter” spending surge during the Vietnam War.<br />What about the extraordinary stimulus spending of the past year? Larry Summers, the highly respected former Treasury secretary and economic adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, warned that the Biden stimulus would create purchasing power “at least three times the size of the output shortfall” and would be “the least responsible macroeconomic policies we’ve had in the last 40 years.”<br />We need only look at the Bureau of Economic Analysis comparison of the first quarter of 2021 to a year earlier to confirm Mr. Summers’s concerns. Wages and salaries are already significantly larger in the first quarter of 2021 than they were before the pandemic. Transfer payments have almost doubled and personal savings have surged to an extraordinary $4.1 trillion from $1.6 trillion a year ago. The end of the pandemic isn’t only unleashing the pent-up demand of the pre-shutdown economy. It is opening the floodgate to a torrent of spending fueled by fiscal and monetary stimulus not seen since the Civil War.<br />The U.S. economy clearly has the power to iron out the natural problems of restarting production, but the very nature of the subsidies in the $6 trillion Biden administration stimulus, relief and infrastructure bills constrain production. In its modern incarnation, socialism denies that government incentives and constraints have anything to do with people’s decisions to work, save and invest. Experience teaches otherwise.</td>

      <td>The high court could put questions about gestational limits back into voters’ hands—where they belong.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will hear Mississippi’s defense of its limit on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. However the high court rules, it’s unlikely to satisfy activists on either side. But a large majority of Americans would likely support a decision upholding the law.<br />Mississippi’s law prohibits abortion when “the probable gestational age of the unborn human being” is “greater than” 15 weeks, “except in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality,” defined as a condition that is “incompatible with life outside the womb.” As in previous abortion cases, the law was challenged as unconstitutional in toto by an abortion clinic, Jackson Women’s Health Organization.<br />The state’s limit has broad support nationally. As one researcher found, “Polls stretching back for decades show that two-thirds or more of the public believe abortion should generally be illegal in the second trimester.” The most recent Gallup poll on the matter in 2018 found that 65% thought abortion should be illegal in the second trimester (after 12 weeks). A January 2020 Marist Poll found 7 in 10 Americans support limiting abortion after the first trimester.<br />There is a notion—repeated throughout the media and implied sometimes even by Supreme Court justices—that Americans are too “polarized” to decide the abortion issue through the democratic process and need the court to do it for them. The Mississippi case and polling on gestational limits obviously demonstrates that there is copious middle ground. The position of activists at both ends of the spectrum shouldn’t obscure the broad public agreement on moderate limits, and the potential for legislators to write reasonable laws.<br />Mississippi hasn’t asked the Supreme Court to overturn Planned Parenthood v. Casey or Roe v. Wade. Instead, the justices will consider “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional,” a modest question. This is one the high court has never addressed directly, though it has bypassed it more than once. The Supreme Court created its “viability rule” in Roe—though it was dictum, a point not necessary to its decision. And it merely repeated the rule in Casey, also dictum, based on the casual assertion that states have two interests in limiting abortions—in prenatal lives and maternal health—which are “not strong enough” before fetal viability to justify a broad limitation.</td>

      <td>For several quarters now executives at  Home Depot  and  Lowe’s  Cos. have faced the same old question: Just how much more can consumers spend on their homes? The answer has been consistent: More than you would think.<br />Home Depot’s comparable sales increased 31% in the quarter ended May 2 compared with the year-ago period—its highest growth rate since the pandemic began. It was an easier year-over-year comparison for the retailer because sales growth was muted in the 2020 period when Covid-19 put more of a damper on its urban-weighted store footprint. Lowe’s comparable sales rose by 25.9% in its quarter ended April 30, which was a slight slowdown compared with the prior quarter’s 28.1%. Both retailers beat Wall Street expectations handily on their top and bottom lines, with net income for Home Depot and Lowe’s surging 84.6% and 73.6%, respectively.<br />The two retailers’ results seem to dispel some bearish theories around consumer behavior. One fear was that rampant inflation in raw materials would motivate consumers to postpone or cancel projects. A sheet of lumber product that was priced at $9.55 at Home Depot roughly a year ago had quadrupled in price to $39.76, the company noted in its Tuesday earnings call. Still, lumber was among the top-performing categories for both Home Depot and Lowe’s last quarter.<br />Another concern was that strong demand from do-it-yourself consumers would wane quickly because much of it was driven by fleeting pandemic habits. That doesn’t seem to have been the case so far, with DIY demand still growing at a healthy pace, though both retailers reported even stronger demand from professional customers.<br />Both companies’ share prices fell after they announced blowout results, just as they have for the past few quarters despite consistently topping expectations. Investors can’t seem to shake the concern that the music might stop abruptly as consumers shift their attention and spending away from their homes.</td>

Shane Dixon Kavanaugh reports for The Oregonian:<br />Even in what is arguably America’s leftwardmost political jurisdiction, it turns out that “defund the police” is a rallying cry for only a small percentage of the citizenry, despite what CNN viewers have been led to believe. The new Oregonian poll also helps puncture the myth that people of color don’t want cops in their neighborhoods. Mr. Kavanaugh reports:<br />This column recently noted that in Seattle, a large annual survey found that blacks trust the police more than whites do, and that across all demographic groups there is little support for defunding. Citizens are calling for more police in neighborhoods racked by lawlessness. If the radical and destructive policies promoted by the Black Lives Matter organization don’t sell in Portland and Seattle, where do they sell?<br />Unfortunately they remain popular nationwide among the political and media classes, notwithstanding the lack of voter support.

      <td>Former prosecutor Carlos Vega loses Democratic race despite police backing</td>
      <td>Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, one of the highest-profile progressive prosecutors in the U.S., has won the Democratic primary election, according to the Associated Press, putting him in strong position to gain a second four-year term.<br />Mr. Krasner defeated Carlos Vega, a former prosecutor backed by the local police union and whom Mr. Krasner fired shortly after his tenure began in 2018. He will face defense attorney Chuck Peruto in the Nov. 2 general election.<br />The Democratic candidate for this position often wins the general, with registered Democrats in the city outnumbering Republicans seven to one.<br />Mr. Krasner, 60 years old, is among a wave of progressive prosecutors elected in recent years with a platform of reducing prosecutions for low-level crimes, changing bail conditions and opposition to the death penalty. His win could serve as an early gauge of their support, as cities nationwide grapple with an increase in murders and shootings.<br />Tuesday’s election was seen as a test of local attitudes toward Mr. Krasner’s reformist policies at a time of soaring homicide and shooting levels in the nation’s sixth-largest city. Philadelphia had 499 homicides last year, the second-highest total on record, and this year has recorded 197 killings through Monday, a 41% increase from the same point in 2020, police figures show.</td>

      <td>The zombie flick is a ready-made franchise for the streamer, with a prequel movie, a TV series and virtual-reality experience already in the pipeline.</td>
      <td>“Army of the Dead” rolls several tried-and-true movie plots into one. A heist involving a cash-filled vault. A motley band of fighters reuniting for one big score. Lots of zombies.<br />It’s also the brainchild of Zack Snyder, a director with hardcore fans and a filmography featuring Superman, Batman and other major Hollywood assets.<br />These are the components of a franchise starter kit for  Netflix ,  which is going after movie properties that can grab viewers on a global scale and keep them coming back for more installments. The company rolled out “Army of the Dead” in about 600 movie theaters last week (its widest theatrical release yet) ahead of a streaming premiere Friday. But before anyone had even seen the movie, Netflix shot a prequel (“Army of Thieves”) expected later this year, and entered production on an anime series (“Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas”) set for next year. Coming this summer, a virtual-reality experience that pops up in various cities, where ticket buyers can ride a simulated taco truck into zombie-infested Las Vegas on a search-and-rescue mission.<br /><br />“People don’t want to wait. They are used to series—they want to binge it,” Mr. Snyder says. “Now there’s so much content, you forget. ‘Army of the Dead,’ what’s that? Oh yeah, that zombie movie from a couple years ago.”</td>

      <td>Pigment-splattered jeans, T-shirts and sneakers that look like Jackson Pollock wore them in his studio are trending. Here, an investigation of the (pricey) crafty clothing craze.</td>
      <td>Ralph Lauren’s workwear-inspired subbrand Double RL is currently selling a pair of jeans covered with Jackson Pollock-esque paint splotches. While the price, $429, couldn’t buy you even a square inch of an original by the Abstract Expressionist artist, it’s significantly higher than that of an average pair of slim-cut denims.<br />Paint-splattered gear is increasingly on offer—often at elevated prices—in clothing shops of late. British designer Paul Smith sells a $195 speckled tee that looks like it got shot with a few paintballs; Italian label Palm Angels markets a $780 green hoodie with scattered paint flecks and, for an extra-raggedy look, cutoff cuffs; and Maison Margiela is demanding $1,220 for linen boots that appear to have been splashed with a can or two of Sherwin-Williams. Anyone who’s splatter-curious but budget-conscious can sample the trend in sneaker form: Both Nike and Converse sell relatively affordable $100-ish shoes lightly drizzled with pigment.<br />Ready-made clothes that suggest you just haphazardly repainted your bedroom are not novel. In the 1990s, Helmut Lang sold coveted jeans with a restrained sprinkling of white paint. Maison Margiela has peddled its own paint-splashed sneakers for years. In 2018, Japanese designer Junya Watanabe released an entire collection built around paint-drenched chore coats and Levi’s jeans.<br />It’s no surprise that paint is being profitably splattered again in 2021, when other forms of crafty clothing are key to the fashion zeitgeist. Several years ago, New York brand Bode kicked off a trend for doodled-on garments with its $1,000-plus corduroys featuring hand-drawn images. Luxe Los Angeles label Amiri sells a spotty $750 bleached hoodie that makes whoever’s wearing it look like he got in a fight with a Clorox jug and lost. And we are many years into a tie-dye craze that has made tweens, retirees and everyone in between look like devoted Deadheads.<br />When asked about this craftwork craze, Roma Cohen, the owner of Miami boutique Alchemist, noted that after the pandemic year shoppers just want to “wear something that makes people happy.” Customers crave the devil-may-care, “no worries, man!” image that comes from wearing a tie-dye top or jeans that look like an action painter’s drop cloth.</td>

      <td>The usefulness of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as actual currencies took a hit along with their prices this week</td>
      <td>Bitcoin bulls sitting on massive long-term gains might be able to laugh off the most recent selloff in it and other cryptocurrencies, but the episode still exposes flaws in the argument for bitcoin as a true substitute for sovereign currencies.<br />On Wednesday morning, bitcoin was down about 20% over the previous 24 hours. That has brought bitcoin’s price in dollars down to levels not seen since…just a few months ago. Someone who bought the cryptocurrency two years ago would still have more than tripled their money. A five-year holder is sitting on gains of over 6,000%.<br />For many speculators, that record will be enough to justify holding on or buying the dip. But its historic gains rest at least partly on the prospect that it will someday rival major currencies as a store of value and medium of exchange—in other words, a true currency. Events this week serve as a reminder of why that is far from assured.<br />To begin with, the volatility of cryptocurrencies is itself a major drawback. For a speculative risk asset, volatility is actually somewhat desirable. For a currency it most decidedly isn’t. A high degree of uncertainty as to what bitcoin will be worth in the near future makes it hard to rely on as a medium of exchange: The payment you are taking for a good or service today might not be exchangeable for other goods and services next week at anything near what you thought. It is a basic but important point.<br />Secondly, the apparent cause of the most recent volatility is troubling. On Tuesday, three Chinese industry bodies issued a joint notice barring Chinese financial institutions and payments companies from accepting cryptocurrencies as payment or using them as a means of settlement, according to Chinese state media reports.</td>

Yet in many areas—international travel and hotel occupancy in many cities—the recovery hasn’t happened yet.<br />Here are some bright spots, as well as lingering areas of concern.<br />Take your pick. TSA airport screenings in the first 16 days of May have been down 35% compared with the number of people at airports in 2019—or up 715% compared with the same days in May last year. Either way, you can gauge progress through those numbers.<br />With international travel still so restricted (though the European Union on Wednesday took a step toward opening its borders to vaccinated tourists) and business travel still only a fraction of what it once was, you’re not going to get anywhere close to full 2019 restoration. And yet to only be down 35% without those two huge travel components shows just how strong the domestic travel surge is now that more people are vaccinated.</td>

      <td>REYKJAVIK, Iceland—U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s tour of Arctic nations, intended to demonstrate the Biden administration’s interest in the U.S. assuming a greater leadership role within multilateral organizations, has been disrupted from the start by the world’s focus this week on violence in the Middle East.<br />The top U.S. diplomat was forced to shift his schedule along the way, canceling meetings to work the phones to promote a de-escalation of the conflict. Mr. Blinken mentioned the Middle East in nearly every public event, taking questions from American and foreign journalists at every encounter.<br />Switching gears in the middle of a trip is nothing new for a U.S. secretary of sate with global responsibilities. Still, this week’s multitasking shows the difficulties the Biden administration has faced as it seeks to shift the focus of U.S. foreign policy from conflicts in the Middle East toward China. Biden administration officials say Beijing is the only power that can stymie U.S. interests around the globe. Meanwhile, Russia’s new Arctic ambitions are challenging the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, who are convening, with Russia, in Reykjavik this week for a meeting of the Arctic Council.<br />The Arctic Council is supposed to sidestep security issues entirely and focus on the effects of climate change, rules for sustainable economic development, and the welfare of indigenous communities. In addition to the U.S., its members are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. China, which has clashed with the U.S. over the Middle East conflict in the United Nations Security Council, participates in Arctic Council events as an observer.<br />“This is a time when you can’t hardly separate yourself from the geopolitics,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), who frequents the gathering.</td>

He’d been burned before.<br />The flight was part of a highly anticipated travel bubble between the two cities due to launch on May 26. While the rest of the world is working out how to relax travel restrictions—the European Union moved this week to allow vaccinated tourists—the two Asian financial centers have tried for months to open up quarantine-free travel. In November, a sudden spike of Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong killed the first stab at the initiative one day before it was set to start. On Monday, a surge in Singapore canceled the second, dashing hopes yet again.<br />“Next time they should just announce the launch 24 hours before, so Covid won’t know,” Mr. Wong, 33, said.<br />Each time, authorities in the two cities carefully drafted detailed criteria and unveiled new safety protocols to open their borders to each other. Travel-starved residents rushed to snap up limited seats on the two planned flights a day, one in each direction in the plan’s initial phase. Some penciled in multiple lunches each afternoon to cram in reunions with friends.<br />The cities first revealed plans for a bubble last October. When it burst the following month, an image depicting balloon debris from a celebratory arch for passengers was shared widely among Hong Kong residents, a symbol of the deflation felt by travelers.</td>

The council in February revoked the minority status of several of Piston Group’s subsidiaries.<br />According to the lawsuit, Piston Group said the council told the company that the decision was because Mr. Johnson, who is Black, isn’t involved enough in day-to-day operations—a characterization the company rebuts—and that his leadership team wasn’t diverse enough.<br />Piston Group claims in the lawsuit that without its minority status it will lose out on business opportunities. Across industries, large companies use minority-purchasing programs to ensure diversity within their supply chains. Certification puts minority-owned suppliers on the radars of the procurement arms of big companies.<br />Piston Group is asking the Wayne County circuit court in Detroit, where the suit was filed, for an injunction that would restore its minority certification.</td>

The president only went so far as to say he “supported” a cease-fire, a statement that the administration’s critics saw as weak, especially since it was paired with caveats about Israel’s right to defend its citizens.<br />The careful language reflects Mr. Biden’s delicate balancing act between seeking a productive relationship with the Israeli government—long a priority with many politicians of the president’s generation—and appeasing a more restive element of his Democratic Party. Even its more centrist members are now echoing some of the impatience with Israel of the party’s progressive wing.<br />Republican lawmakers who have spoken out, meanwhile, mostly have urged strong support for Israel. Sen. Todd Young (R., Ind.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) called for efforts to achieve a cease-fire quickly over the weekend.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—More centrist Democrats are choosing not to run for re-election in the House and others are considering bowing out, creating headaches for local party officials trying to find replacements just as redistricting is introducing more uncertainty into the 2022 races.<br />The Democrats are trying to hold on to a razor-thin majority in the House, where historically the party with control of the presidency loses seats in midterm elections. Their job is complicated by the looming reapportionment of seats for states and redrawing of congressional lines to balance districts’ populations, as required by law.<br />The changes are expected to favor Republicans as red-leaning states are gaining more seats on net, and because the GOP has more control of the state legislatures redrawing the boundaries. These factors could dissuade Democrats from jumping into a race early.<br />“If you’re making one of the most important decisions of your entire life, volatility and uncertainty generally don’t incentivize you to make a fast decision,” said Charlie Cook, who runs the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.<br />Rep. Cheri Bustos (D., Ill.), who led the House Democratic campaign arm in 2020 when the party unexpectedly lost seats, is one of the lawmakers calling it quits. Last month, she said won’t seek re-election, citing a need for a career change, sending a shock wave through her district in northwestern Illinois. An hour after she announced her decision, her 2020 Republican opponent announced a new bid.</td>

      <td>The direct-to-consumer brand will offer two styles for men made in part from recycled plastic bottles, just like its ever-popular women’s flats.</td>
      <td>When the San Francisco-based startup Rothy’s launched a line of relatively affordable, machine-washable, pointy-toed knit women’s ballet flats made of recycled plastic bottles, few in the fashion industry could have guessed the shoes would develop a cult following.<br />Now, five years later, Rothy’s is stepping into men’s shoes and hoping for a similar hit. The company plans to debut its men’s shoe line on the label’s website and in its six stores on May 20, starting with a minimalist $175 sneaker and a $185 driving loafer. Additional colors and styles will drop throughout the year.<br />Rothy’s foray into sustainable shoes for the opposite sex comes as men continue to step up their shoe game. Sales of U.S. men’s footwear rose more than 32 percent during the first three months of this year, compared with the same period a year ago, according to market researcher NPD Group.<br />“We feel like the time is right,” says Rothy’s co-founder and chief executive officer Stephen Hawthornthwaite, 51. “It’s an exciting moment for us to be able to extend our mission around sustainability to a really significant other half of the consumer that we’ve never been able to address,” adds co-founder and president Roth Martin, 48. The company, which now also offers bags, children’s shoes and masks, all direct-to-consumer like its shoes, says it brought in 450,000 new customers in 2020 despite the pandemic while some existing customers continued to buy repeat or new styles. It projects that 2021 sales will be “well north of $140 million,” Hawthornthwaite says. Now with men’s, he says, “we think it’s an opportunity to double the size of the company.”<br />The sneaker potentially thrusts Rothy’s in a toe-to-toe with Allbirds, the San Francisco–based company whose $95 “Runner” sneakers made of eco-friendly wool rather than leather have become Silicon Valley’s go-to footwear.</td>

      <td>A joint venture between Chrysler owner Stellantis and iPhone-assembler Foxconn applies the auto industry’s approach to battery investments to its latest priority: vehicle software</td>
      <td>Henry Ford invested in steel production and Brazilian rubber. Today’s car makers are getting into batteries and software.<br />On Tuesday, Chrysler owner Stellantis and iPhone-assembler Foxconn, also known as  Hon Hai Precision Industry ,  announced a joint venture to develop in-vehicle software and services. This is the latest in a long series of moves by auto makers to improve their supply chains for fully electric, digital vehicles.<br />Car makers want more control over components central to the performance and experience of EVs. But they don’t have a lot of experience with those parts, and face many competing claims for investment. JVs with specialist suppliers offer a solution.<br />Batteries, the single most expensive EV component, have been the chief focus so far.  General Motors  has a JV with South Korean battery giant  LG Chem  to make cells; Stellantis and  Volkswagen  have deals with European battery companies;  Toyota  has one with  Panasonic .  Ford said last month that it too wanted to get into cell production, though it hasn’t yet detailed how.<br />The Stellantis-Foxconn JV, called Mobile Drive, applies this approach to software. It is a logical step, but still an unusual one. Toyota and Volkswagen, the two largest car makers by sales, are building up their own software companies. Smaller players such as Volvo and Renault are leaning heavily on Google owner Alphabet, which has a version of its Android smartphone operating system for vehicles.</td>

By 21, she was a Rhodes scholar and held a top Justice Department position by her early 30s.<br />Now, she is one of eight Democratic contenders seeking to become Manhattan district attorney, drawing on her immigrant roots and meteoric rise in the legal field to center her campaign around reforming the office.<br />“I know what it’s like to be given an opportunity,” said Ms. Farhadian Weinstein. “That motivates me and makes me want others to have opportunity and prosperity, and I think safety is a precondition for all of that.”<br />Her personal story helps to blunt criticism from her opponents that she is the candidate for Manhattan’s most affluent residents. Ms. Farhadian Weinstein, whose husband, Boaz Weinstein, founded hedge fund Saba Capital Management LP, has raised over $2.5 million, more than any other candidate, with hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from the finance sector.<br />Those who know her personally said her wealth is only part of her story.</td>

      <td>LONDON—British polluters could face higher costs for emissions in the U.K.’s new post-Brexit carbon market, a key plank of the country’s efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.<br />Futures for U.K. emission allowances changed hands at £47.11 a metric ton, or just under $67, in their trading debut on  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s  marketplace Wednesday. That placed U.K. prices about 7% above prices in the European Union’s carbon market, the world’s largest.<br />Trading on the first morning was thin: Just 52 contracts, for permits covering 52,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, changed hands by 6:40 a.m. ET.<br />Traders were awaiting the first auction for allowances at 7 a.m. ET. Just under 6.1 million permits, each allowing companies to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide or an equivalent amount of other greenhouse gases, are up for sale with results due by 9:15 a.m. ET.<br />The market went live at a time when prices in the EU’s carbon market, which the U.K. helped develop, are soaring. Prices have risen 58% this year to €51.24, or about $63, and recently touched a record. High gas prices, coupled with an influx of money from investors betting the bloc’s efforts to combat climate change will tighten carbon supplies, have fueled the climb.</td>

      <td>Canadian National’s risky bid for Kansas City Southern draws ire of large shareholder TCI—for good reason</td>
      <td>Canadian National is steaming full speed ahead toward a dangerous junction. The market is starting to wonder whether it will lose its nerve.<br />Kansas City Southern  shares hit an all-time high above $315 a share last Thursday after the smallest U.S. Class I railroad deemed Canadian National’s roughly $325-a-share bid to be superior to the one it had accepted from rival  Canadian Pacific .  Since then, doubts have crept in and the shares have retreated to $295. The latest wrinkle is a strongly worded letter Tuesday from Chris Hohn and Ben Walker of TCI Fund Management, a large shareholder in both Canadian railroads but not—unfortunately for them—their U.S. target.<br />Messrs. Hohn and Walker want Canadian National to abandon its plan to form a voting trust—a vehicle it would use to buy KCS before gaining approval from the Surface Transportation Board late next year, if all goes to plan. Without that structure, however, KCS’s board would almost certainly go back to the original bid from Canadian Pacific, since its shareholders would have no certainty of getting paid.<br />In effect, TCI is telling Canadian National not to risk rejection, and it has a good point—though also a self-serving one as Canadian Pacific’s largest shareholder. While it is probably a slight exaggeration to say that setting up the trust but not getting a deal approved could wipe out nearly all of Canadian National’s shareholders’ equity, it certainly could vaporize a large chunk of it. The difference between what KCS’s equity was worth before Canadian Pacific’s bid and what Canadian National will pay, plus compensation for the $700 million termination fee, is about $14 billion. An outright rejection of the deal by regulators could force the trust to sell KCS in a few years at a big loss. And if it doesn’t even get to that stage because U.S. regulators don’t approve its voting trust, then it would still be out $1.7 billion—the initial termination fee plus an additional reverse breakup fee.<br />Canadian Pacific, meanwhile, may win by losing. Its U.S.-traded shares also hit an all-time high last Thursday when KCS backed out of its agreement. If Canadian National stands down or if it pushes ahead and doesn’t have its voting trust approved, then Canadian Pacific stands a better chance of approval since the Surface Transportation Board granted a waiver to more stringent post-2001 merger rules due to Canadian Pacific’s smaller size. KCS would have no other viable industry bidders, since any other combination would result in an even larger merger than the one just rejected.</td>

Gen. Aviv Kohavi are holding ongoing discussions on whether Hamas has been sufficiently deterred by the operation, the official said.<br />The Israeli military has launched hundreds of airstrikes in Gaza, aimed at what it says are Hamas’s military infrastructure and personnel. Israel’s military says it has killed 130 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants so far, and destroyed all of their rocket manufacturing sites and 100 kilometers of an underground tunnel system that Israel says the militant group uses to maneuver and launch attacks.</td>

That project was later shelved as competition for solar projects rose and returns on plants dropped.<br />SoftBank had also been struggling with tightening returns on solar projects in its biggest market of India, where it had announced a goal of building 20 gigawatts of solar power at an estimated cost of $20 billion.<br />SoftBank still has a Tokyo-based energy unit that holds 50 renewable-energy projects, all but one in Japan, with a capacity of around 770 megawatts. The company has also purchased solar assets in the U.S. without disclosing how much it holds.</td>

So is the stock appetizing or not?<br />The meal delivery company could do no wrong during the height of the pandemic, when eaters who didn’t want to cook had few choices other than delivery or takeout and many restaurants had to embrace delivery just to stay in business. DoorDash grew its revenue last year by 228% on an annual basis, propelling it to a peak market value of $68.5 billion in February, just two months after its initial public offering.<br />Heading into last week’s first-quarter earnings report, DoorDash’s shares had shed more than 46% of their value from that peak. They have rebounded sharply and even rose on Tuesday following the expiration of a lockup period for insiders to sell their shares—often a weak day for recently listed companies.<br />Investors must now evaluate how addictive consumers’ delivery habits will remain in a more normal world. A recent study found about 70% of last year’s growth across the U.S. food delivery industry was purely because of the pandemic, concluding that if dine-in activity returned to pre-pandemic levels, food delivery growth would decline.<br />DoorDash said its first quarter revenue grew 198% year-over-year—an improvement over the 172% growth it saw in the first quarter of last year. Still, as of March 31 restaurants were hardly back to business as usual. Data from OpenDoor shows seated diners in the first quarter were down on average 45% nationwide compared with 2019 levels, indicating delivery was still a relative necessity for those craving their favorite restaurant meal.</td>

      <td>SINGAPORE—For months, Covid-19 seemed to be all but gone from parts of Asia, where some of the world’s most successful battles to contain the coronavirus were waged. But several places are now struggling with new outbreaks.<br />Taiwan, which last year had a stretch of more than eight months  without any locally transmitted cases, set a single-day record with 333 of them on Monday. Vietnam, which had also squashed the curve, reported its highest case count a day earlier. Singapore banned dining-in at restaurants, closed schools and put limits on social gatherings after reporting double-digit increases in domestic cases for several days. Rapid transmission in Thailand’s prisons led to a record 9,600 new cases on Monday—surpassing the total number reported in 2020.<br />The new waves are nowhere near as devastating as India’s fierce outbreak or as past deadly surges in the West. But occurring in places that appeared to have beaten the virus, they show how difficult it is to keep Covid-19 suppressed while infections swell elsewhere in the world, more-transmissible variants take hold and vaccine rollouts fail to gather pace outside a clutch of wealthy nations.<br />Apart from Singapore, where more than a fifth of the population is fully vaccinated, inoculation levels across much of Southeast Asia are in the low single digits. Taiwan has administered shots to only about 220,000 of its nearly 24 million people, and on Saturday it suspended self-paid vaccinations—which were available to people who needed to travel abroad for work, education or medical treatment—to give priority to front-line workers.<br />“In places with vaccines, like the United States and the U.K., you have falling cases. But pretty much everywhere else, even in countries that previously had done a great job, you have rising cases,” said Todd Pollack, an infectious-diseases specialist at Harvard Medical School who runs a health program in Vietnam. “It’s a likely occurrence and will continue to happen until vaccines can be rolled out.”</td>

The new fund is expected to close on Oct. 1.<br />Some hedge funds have been investing part of their money in private companies for years, saying they would miss out on opportunities to profit otherwise, given that companies are staying private longer. But interest from hedge funds has soared recently as profits have proliferated and companies have gone public at a rapid pace.<br />For the year through Friday, more than $312 billion of registered equity offerings through initial public offerings, special-purpose acquisition companies and follow-on deals came to market in the U.S., according to Dealogic.

Popular firms tied to the sector such as electric-car-battery company  QuantumScape  Corp.  and space-tourism firm  Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.  are down 50% or more during that span. SPACs listing splashy firms such as electric-car startup Lucid Motors and personal-finance company Social Finance are also taking a beating.<br />The reversal highlights the risks that come with popular speculative trades. It is occurring as investors retreat from technology stocks amid fears that rising inflation will force the Federal Reserve to end its easy-money policies more quickly than anticipated. Those concerns make wagers on rapidly growing companies less appealing. Those related to SPACs have been among the worst hit by the selloff and have been battered by signals that regulators are increasing scrutiny of so-called blank-check companies.<br />The swift change in momentum for what was one of the winter’s hottest investments shows how quickly volatile assets from startups to cryptocurrencies can inflict pain on traders. Early this year, nearly all SPACs were rising, even when there was little fundamental reason behind the gains.<br />Former athletes and celebrities from Alex Rodriguez to the singer Ciara are involved with SPACs, which made stars out of prolific deal makers such as venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya. Now, nearly all companies tied to the space are in a uniform free fall, engulfing names backed by even the most popular SPAC creators.</td>

The chance to helm the nation’s largest online marketplace for babysitters and other caregivers appealed to the father of 6-year-old twins.<br />Care.com was at a challenging juncture. Pre-IAC, the company had changed leaders and overhauled its screening practices after a 2019 investigation by The Wall Street Journal found Care.com conducted limited vetting of caregivers and day-care centers. In several instances, the Journal found caregivers hired through the platform had police records and had been accused of committing crimes while caring for clients, including child abuse and sexual assault.<br />Under Mr. Allen, Care.com was implementing more safeguards when the pandemic struck. Over the past year, the company has tried to meet a shifting array of family-care needs created by lockdowns and school closures. In addition to partnering with several cities and states to match front-line workers with child care, the site started helping families find learning “pods” and tutors to help students navigate remote schooling. Meanwhile, demand from employers wanting to use the site to provide child-care benefits grew 100% year over year in each of the past four quarters, the company said.<br />The 43-year-old Mr. Allen recently spoke with the Journal from his home in Austin, Texas.

      <td>French retailer  Carrefour SA  recently began its first share buyback in a decade, spurred by strong cash flow and a belief that the economic recovery is under way. And it isn’t alone.<br />This year has seen a slew of companies in Europe putting forward share repurchase programs, including luxury house  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE ,  personal care company  L’Oréal SA  and oil major  Eni  SpA. Around 56 firms have released plans to buy their own shares so far in 2021, the most for the comparable period in three years, according to an analysis by  Société Générale SA .<br />The trend signals growing confidence among corporate leaders and marks a pivot in strategy in a region that has traditionally favored dividends. The pandemic may have accelerated the shift toward rewarding shareholders through buybacks, at least temporarily, according to analysts at the French bank.<br />As lockdowns and social distancing hit earnings, many companies cut or canceled dividend policies last year. For some industries, such as banking, regulators required it. European firms issued close to €1 trillion of debt last year, equivalent to $1.2 trillion, data from Dealogic showed, building up cash cushions to weather the storm. Now that the recovery appears to have some momentum, many are unwinding these emergency measures and preparing payouts to shareholders.<br />“In 2020, a lot of companies were forced to cut dividends, which is very painful,” said Roland Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy at Société Générale. “Buybacks, it’s a way to return cash to your shareholders, if you don’t want to commit too much and too soon to higher dividends in the coming quarters.”</td>

Susan Collins, according to a search warrant recently unsealed in federal court.<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation has searched electronic devices belonging to defense executive Martin Kao seeking evidence that he orchestrated an effort to funnel allegedly illegal contributions to help Ms. Collins, a Maine Republican, in her 2020 reelection bid. Federal law prohibits defense contractors from making contributions to federal elected officials.<br />Federal agents requested the warrant, unsealed Friday, citing evidence that Mr. Kao, through a personal account and his company’s, reimbursed friends and family members for about $45,000 in donations they made directly to Ms. Collins’s campaign. Such a pattern of behavior would violate a federal law banning donations made in the name of another person. Investigators also allege that Mr. Kao unlawfully directed $150,000 in corporate funds to a super PAC supporting Ms. Collins’s 2020 re-election campaign.<br />At the time, Mr. Kao was serving as the chief executive of Navatek, a Hawaii-based defense contractor that has since been renamed Martin Defense Group. A spokeswoman for the company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />There is no evidence that Ms. Collins is under investigation. “The Collins for Senator Campaign had absolutely no knowledge of anything alleged in the warrant,” said Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for the lawmaker.</td>

But its rivals haven’t been sitting still.<br />“AT&T has a lot of catching up to do,” said Craig Moffett, a longtime telecom analyst at industry research firm MoffettNathanson LLC. “They’re almost certain to be a third player in a three-horse race.”<br />Mr. Moffett said company leaders made the right decision by refocusing their attention on AT&T’s core strengths, though the business will face challenges getting an edge over rivals. But they must still contend with business units facing high costs and shrinking revenue.<br />An AT&T spokesman disagreed, saying the company’s wireless spectrum position “has never been stronger” and still has slack capacity to serve more data to wireless customers. The company told investors it expects to increase its overall revenue and adjusted per-share earnings in the long run.</td>

      <td>Editor’s note: This week’s Future View features advice for younger college students. Next week we’ll ask, “What should America’s stance be toward the latest fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before May 25. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Happiness Isn’t Found at the End of a Résumé<br />Sometimes you have to make selfish choices. After all, you’re in college for self-oriented goals: to educate yourself and become a better candidate for whichever job you want at the end. But people can get carried away with this logic and lose their way in the process—I’ve seen it happen. Students volunteer solely to build résumés, make friends only to strengthen professional networks, and exclude others to make themselves look better. It’s sad watching passions dissolve and be replaced by a heartless drive to shape appearances.<br />Many students become frustrated, lacking the meaningful personal connections and pursuit of real interests that make life exciting. My advice to younger students would be to take a step back at several points in your education. Notice whether you are doing something because of how you will be perceived or because you truly enjoy it. Boosting your résumé and building networks are important, but in focusing on success at all costs—getting the job or the internship—it is all too easy to suppress doubts about whether what you are doing will contribute to your happiness. If that’s a concern, face it earlier rather than later. Stay curious and pursue the things that truly mean something to you.</td>

      <td>There’s little chance of a fair-minded inquiry in today’s Washington.</td>
      <td>Democrats are forcing a House vote Wednesday to establish a commission to investigate the events of Jan. 6, despite opposition from Republican leaders. Do not expect this largely partisan vote to yield a bipartisan accounting of the Capitol riot.<br />An independent commission could be useful if it answered outstanding questions and agreed on a common set of facts about events. The Capitol police and law enforcement haven't been forthcoming with key details—such as the role the police played in letting rioters enter the building, or the circumstances of the killing of protester Ashli Babbitt, or what they know about who planned what.<br />Yet the prospects for that are none and slimmer. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been driving this idea, and she has a record of using these commissions for partisan ends. Her goal here is drive her narrative that the riot was a planned attempted coup, and to run on that theme to keep the House in 2022. She tipped her ambitions when she first proposed a commission with seven members appointed by Democrats and four by Republicans.<br />She has since made concessions to Republicans, who are divided as usual. Last week New York’s John Katko, the ranking Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, struck a commission deal with Democrats. House GOP LeaderKevin McCarthy immediately panned the proposal. This is the latest leadership misfire by Mr. McCarthy, which doesn’t bode well if he becomes Speaker in 2023.<br />The press says Republicans got what they wanted, namely a commission with five members (including the chair) named by Democrats, and five (including a vice chair) by Republicans. The proposal requires agreement between the chair and vice chair—or a vote of a majority of the commission—to issue subpoenas. The commission would be required to issue its report by Dec. 31.</td>

      <td>The result in the Mississippi case is hard to predict.</td>
      <td>So much for ducking the hard cases. Not long after taking up a contentious New York gun-rights case, the Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear what could become a landmark case on abortion rights.<br />Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization concerns Mississippi’s 2018 law that, with rare exceptions, barred abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Lower courts overturned the law as a violation of the Supreme Court’s precedents, notably the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling that said state laws cannot impose an “undue burden” on the right to abortion.<br />The question is whether the current Court, bolstered by new Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, is ready to narrow Casey or even overturn it and Roe v. Wade. The left is already predicting the latter, in apocalyptic terms, but it always does.<br />This is hardly a foregone result. It makes sense that the Court wouldn’t take the case merely to affirm the lower courts. But then only four Justices are needed to take up a case, and no one outside the Court knows which Justices voted to take this one. Those four Justices may not even know if there’s a majority to uphold the Mississippi law, much less overturn Casey and Roe. Among the current Justices, only Clarence Thomas is on record as calling for Roe and Casey to be overturned.<br />The Court intrigue is compounded by the narrow question its order in the case said the Justices will address: whether all pre-viability bans on elective abortions violate the Constitution. This suggests the Court could uphold the Mississippi statute while narrowing Casey but not overturning it. Or the Court could say some bans on pre-viability abortions are legal, but that Mississippi’s goes too far by limiting them to 15 weeks. Viability is usually thought to be no earlier than 23-24 weeks.</td>

      <td>A one-of-a-kind camera rig built by PBS and the BBC offers intimate footage of elephants, big cats and other wild animals drawn to a Tanzanian reserve’s most precious resource.</td>
      <td>Although its subjects include the African wildlife that lives in the Serengeti, “Life at the Waterhole” will have homeowners everywhere sympathizing with the show’s furry, feathered cast, and its benefactors as well: You find a nice place to live. Put in a pool. The next thing you know, hyenas move in next door. And there goes the neighborhood.<br />Fans of nature television have a lot to choose from, much of it very good, but “Life at the Waterhole” has a novel angle: With African temperatures rising, existing water sources drying up and competition for survival increasing—not just among wild animals themselves, but between the wild animals and humans and their livestock—why not just build a waterhole? Or two. And supplement the construction with a bunker that houses cameras that can safely operate 24 hours a day. And then watch what happens. With apologies to “Field of Dreams,” the motto of “Life at the Waterhole” might be “If you build it, they will come.” Because they do, by ground and air and in dozens of different species.<br />Located in northern Tanzania on the Mwiba Wildlife Reserve, the twin oases featured in the three-part series were built in 2019 by the production (the BBC Studios Natural History Unit and PBS) in cooperation with the local Hadzabe and Maasai communities. While they hold 13,000 gallons pumped from a sustainable underground reservoir, they still look a bit like puddles, though most Serengeti waterholes do, says M. Sanjayan, a global conservation scientist and the program’s very upbeat host. As a Maasai farmer tells us, three elephants can drain a typical water source in one visit, which only creates more tensions between the beasts and the neighboring homo sapiens (who actually contend with the animals in creative ways). But the animals-only waterhole is, literally, a game changer.<br />Each of the three episodes is devoted to a different season—dry, hot and wet. The clientele is aware, but unbothered, by the cameras running all day and night and collecting such intimate footage of so many animals: warthogs partying in the cooling mud, or elephants and Cape buffalo having a late-night face-off that the elephants, as usual, win. One of the things observed by the show’s cast—which includes nature photographer Bob Poole (who shares Mr. Sanjayan’s enthusiasm) and scientist Meredith Palmer—is how unbearable temperatures, especially during the hot season, drive some species to switch beats and become nocturnal. The arrival of big cats—lions and leopards—changes the profile of the waterhole, and the hyenas simply ruin everything: For days after a hyena visit, no one comes at all.<br />Five miles of fiber-optic cable were laid to enable the cameras of “Life at the Waterhole,” and what they capture is a crazy variety of mammals and birds—not just the zebras and elephants, but dik-dik, serval, steppe eagles, pugnacious Egyptian geese and the brilliantly colored Fischer’s lovebird, found in the wild only in northern Tanzania. What they also offer, more importantly for the viewer perhaps, is drama. Life at the waterhole, after all, is all about staying alive.</td>

      <td>Since Hamas began its rocket offensive last week, the Biden Administration has wisely refused to dictate the Israeli response. But the U.S. narrative war took a notable turn this week as Congressional Democrats demanded a cease-fire. We hope the President bucks his instinct to follow his party and leads it instead.<br />Hamas and Islamic Jihad have launched more than 3,000 rockets into Israel since last week, Jerusalem says, and Israel has been pummeling those groups in the Gaza strip to stop the attacks. Media and progressive activists blamed the Hamas-initiated war on Israel, as they always do, but the White House did not go along.<br />That position may not be viable for much longer on Capitol Hill. “Now, after more than a week of hostilities, it has become even more apparent that a cease-fire is necessary,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy told Politico, “If Israel doesn’t believe a cease-fire is in their interest, that doesn’t mean we have to accept that judgment. We have enormous persuasive power.”<br />Rep. Gregory Meeks, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, reportedly floated an arms-sale delay on Monday, but backed off on Tuesday citing assurances from the White House.<br />With any luck Israel will soon inflict enough damage on Gaza’s terrorist stockpiles and leadership that it can negotiate a genuine cease-fire. Israel wants a swift end to the conflict, not a repeat of its 2014 Operation Protective Edge, which lasted 50 days and involved a Gaza ground incursion.</td>

His bill is so awful that Peter Menzies, a former vice chairman of the commission, said it “doesn’t just infringe on free expression, it constitutes a full-blown assault upon it and, through it, the foundations of democracy.”<br />Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals claim they merely want to level the playing field between traditional broadcasters and online players such as Netflix and Spotify. Yet on its face the bill goes much further.<br />To begin with, anyone who makes programs available over the internet would be treated as a broadcaster and under the thumb of the CRTC. While websites wouldn’t need a formal license to operate in Canada, the commission would have open-ended power to impose conditions and require them to “make expenditures to support the Canadian broadcasting system.” Who has to do this and how much do they have to spend? They’ll tell us later.<br />The legislation also vaguely alludes to the need for the Canadian broadcasting system to “serve the interests of Canadians of diverse ethnocultural backgrounds.” Again, who’d have to do this and what they’d have to do is anyone’s guess.</td>

      <td>Remember Billy Joel’s old friend, the one he sang about in the late-1970s? The guy who “closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the West Coast”? Well, chances are he’s not living there anymore.<br />The Census Bureau announced last month that California has gone the way of New York and Illinois in terms of lackluster population growth and thus will lose a congressional seat in decennial apportionments for the first time ever. Meanwhile, states like Texas and Florida have experienced strong population gains and will increase the size of their delegations in Washington.<br />These population trends predate Covid-19. The Texases and Floridas have long sported lower taxes and better job growth than the Californias and New Yorks, as well as more-welcoming business climates. The pandemic could accelerate these demographic shifts from blue to red states, or from urban to rural locales, as more people work remotely, but don’t underestimate the degree to which social factors could also play an important role in where Americans choose to live.<br />Big blue states aren’t only fiscal train wrecks but often lead the country in faddish thinking about crime and safety. Levels of vagrancy in progressive redoubts like New York City and San Francisco have reached levels that are too high to ignore. In Frisco, which is run by liberals who like to lecture the country about the treatment of low-income minorities, the homeless population numbers 18,000, more than a third of whom are black.<br />In New York City, shootings and homicides rose by 97% and 44%, respectively, in 2020, and felony assaults are up by 25% this year. Yet seven of the eight candidates running in the Democratic primary for Manhattan district attorney have pledged to cut the police budget or prosecute fewer suspects—or some combination of the two. On Sunday, the  New York Times  endorsed Kathryn Garcia, a former sanitation department commissioner, for mayor. According to the paper, Ms. Garcia will address the city’s crime wave by “reforming the New York Police Department,” which “begins with speeding up and strengthening the disciplinary process” for officers.</td>

      <td>Retreat can have its heroic qualities but not a faintest whiff of heroism attached to  AT&T ’s  retreat Monday from its big Warner Media merger, which it will unwind by shifting the assets to  Discovery Inc .<br />Both companies’ stocks went down in the hours after the announcement. The deal looks less about finding the right future for the covetable Warner assets than about sketching for AT&T management a quick escape that could bypass a shareholder vote and face minimal regulatory risk, while wiping down a sizable chunk of debt. In turn, management could shift its focus back to running a wireless business, which a skeptical investment community thinks AT&T’s pratfall-prone leadership is less able to mess up.<br />Warner’s top-drawer assets, especially HBO and its Hollywood movie and TV studios, not to mention its cable TV brands and sports rights, will land on a much smaller Discovery, far more dependent on the declining cable bundle, whose specialty is reality shows. This only prolongs the turmoil at Warner, which has undergone necessary cost cutting and refocusing under AT&T for the streaming age.<br />Discovery’s own share price turned south once investors realized they weren’t getting a bargain, paying $43 billion for a combination that would remain 71% with AT&T shareholders. Behind the curious deal is reportedly former cable king and Discovery shareholder John Malone, known for structuring outcomes that work well tax-wise and governance-wise for John Malone.<br />And the net result? Another freestanding late entrant in the streaming wars, against  Netflix ,   Disney ,   Amazon  and others at a time when too much unwatched content is already competing for eyeballs. Churn is predictably rising as viewers sign up and quit after bingeing on the new hot show. Production and talent costs are soaring out of sight. The audience is fragmenting along with their taste in programming. Young people aren’t watching at all. For many others, the “golden age of TV” is turning drossy: It’s becoming easier not to watch than to invest the time to find a show worth watching.</td>

      <td>Snooping by private intelligence ﬁrms is now a global multibillion-dollar business. But is it to blame for the two-year ‘collusion’ madness?</td>
      <td>For some of us, the idea of a private detective is stuck firmly in a fictional past. Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot—sharp-eyed snoops hired to find the truth about a dead housemaid or a stolen diamond necklace. Private detectives of the present—real-life ones, that is—are part of a multibillion-dollar “private intelligence industry” that has an “oversized impact” on “politics, business, and our personal lives.” So contends Barry Meier, a former New York Times reporter, in “Spooked: The Trump Dossier, Black Cube, and the Rise of Private Spies.”<br />Today’s private detectives—or private spies, as Mr. Meier calls them—make a lot more money than Holmes and Poirot ever did. That is because they are typically hired by multinational corporations and law firms whose wealthy clients have an interest in finding out what their enemies are up to. Also, the secrecy and ethical corner-cutting involved in spying means that the corporations and law firms don’t exactly know what they’re paying for. Mr. Meier records a remark supposedly made by Jules Kroll, founder of the first modern “corporate intelligence” firm in 1972. Asked by a subordinate how he should estimate the cost of a case, Mr. Kroll responded: “You should figure out what you want and then triple it.”<br />The job of a modern private investigator is often to discover unflattering biographical data—aka “dirt”—on the client’s foes. A trailblazer in this area, as you may not be surprised to learn, was the Clinton-Gore campaign of 1992. Faced with the history of Bill Clinton’s extramarital pursuits, the Democratic National Committee hired the San Francisco-based firm Palladino & Sutherland to find dirt on Mr. Clinton’s paramours and so prevent more “bimbo eruptions,” as Clinton spokeswoman Betsey Wright unforgettably called them.<br />More recently the firm Black Cube, founded in Tel Aviv in 2010, was hired for the same purpose by the Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein. For that job, social-media experts called “avatar operators” provided each operative with “an online identity, or ‘legend,’ that consisted of a fake name, a phony past, and an imaginary job history.” The operatives then befriended the women accusing Mr. Weinstein of wrongdoing. The pseudonymous operative got a  Facebook  page full of plausible posts, fake friends and a LinkedIn profile.<br />The bulk of Mr. Meier’s book, however, is given to the story of Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, the former Wall Street Journal reporters who left the paper in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and formed the private intelligence company Fusion GPS. That firm, recall, was hired by the conservative billionaire Paul Singer in 2015 to find compromising information on Donald Trump. After it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the GOP nominee, Messrs. Simpson and Fritsch successfully pitched their services to the Democratic National Committee and hired the former MI6 agent Christopher Steele—himself the proprietor of a private firm, Orbis Business Intelligence—to probe Mr. Trump’s past for unsavory Russian connections. The infamous “dossier” produced by Mr. Steele turned out to be a mix of guesswork and falsehoods fed to him by a single source, Igor Danchenko, a Russian national based in the U.S. who may or may not have known what he was doing.</td>

Mr. Trump was impeached in the House over his actions related to the riot. He was acquitted in the Senate.<br />The Biden White House issued a statement in support of the commission following Mr. McCarthy’s statement Tuesday. “The nation deserves such a full and fair accounting to prevent future violence and strengthen the security and resilience of our democratic institutions,” the statement said.</td>

      <td>Black man was fatally shot by deputies, who were attempting to issue warrants; D.A. says he lacks authority to publicly release body-cam videos</td>
      <td>A North Carolina district attorney said Tuesday the fatal shooting of Andrew Brown Jr. by sheriff deputies in Elizabeth City, N.C., in April was justified, according to his review of the state’s Bureau of Investigation’s probe.<br />Mr. Brown, a 42-year-old Black man, was shot during an April 21 encounter with Pasquotank County Sheriff’s Office deputies, who were attempting to issue drug-related search and arrest warrants.<br />District Attorney Andrew Womble said in a news conference that Mr. Brown backed his car away from a team of officers seeking to arrest him, striking one of the officers. He said Mr. Brown also put the car in drive and was headed toward two other officers when deputies began shooting. He said it was appropriate and legal for deputies to fire their weapons because of their perception that the car was being used as a deadly weapon.<br />“Mr. Brown’s death, while tragic, was justified,” he said. Mr. Brown had a felony record and had previously resisted arrest, Mr. Womble said, a fact that officers had been briefed on while planning the warrant operation.<br />At the news conference, Mr. Womble played several body-camera videos that he said showed deputies didn’t fire their guns until Mr. Brown tried to flee. Mr. Womble said he wouldn’t replay the videos and didn’t have the authority to release it to the public.</td>

      <td>There’s more to the story of the Michigan governor’s recent voyage.</td>
      <td>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D., Mich.) has taken a back seat to no one in regulating the daily lives of citizens during the era of Covid-19. She’s even trying to make some emergency workplace rules permanent in the Wolverine State. But for her own life, it seems Gov. Whitmer is not exactly a fanatic about following rules when she’s in the passenger seat.<br />Recently this column noted Ms. Whitmer’s decision to ignore her own warnings against out-of-state travel. Now there are more questions about her mode of transportation. Paul Egan reports for the Detroit Free Press from Lansing:<br />This new level of controversy relates to questions of both regulation and financing. Mr. Egan reports:<br />As for the financing, the $27,521 trip was funded by a nonprofit organization controlled by Ms. Whitmer called Michigan Transition 2019, with Ms. Whitmer herself pitching in a token $855, the estimated price of a comparable first-class seat.<br />There’s also more news on Ms. Whitmer’s rejection of her own government’s travel advisory. It’s not just an issue of deciding to fly to Florida—which she has singled out as a travel risk—but also her government’s guidance on what to do in the event of such travel.</td>

Research analyst Michael Nathanson estimates the new company will account for 29% of total TV viewing time and 20% of all fees media companies get from monthly cable TV bills.</td>

      <td>President, Treasury secretary say plan will improve global competitiveness of U.S. companies</td>
      <td>President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen promoted the administration’s infrastructure and tax plans as vital for the U.S. to compete globally, as the White House and Republican lawmakers continued to pursue a deal to improve the nation’s bridges, roads and broadband internet.<br />Proclaiming himself a “car guy,” Mr. Biden visited Dearborn, Mich., Tuesday to tour the Ford Motor Co. Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, using the facility to pitch his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, which includes funding for electric vehicles. He argued that his proposals would help create jobs and make the U.S. more competitive with countries like China.<br />“The future of the auto industry is electric,” he said. “The real question is whether we’ll lead or we’ll fall behind in the race to the future. And whether we’ll build these vehicles and the batteries that go in them here in the United States or in other countries.”<br />Mr. Biden spoke in front of a lineup of trucks and referred to the Ford F-150 Lightning, a new electric pickup. Afterward he test-drove a vehicle that the White House said was that model.<br />“This sucker’s quick,” Mr. Biden told reporters. Asked if he would take a question about Israel, he said, “Not unless you get in front of the car as I step on it.” He then said he was teasing.</td>

      <td>Payments will go to about 39 million households starting July 15</td>
      <td>The child tax credit is a federal benefit that reduces income tax liability for people with children. It was created in 1997 and since then has expanded several times. It is a credit that reduces taxes owed as opposed to a deduction that reduces taxable income. The temporary changes in effect for 2021 make it a near-universal monthly child allowance, far from the annual tax break it started as. The changes came about as part of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus bill passed in March<br />Here is how it works.<br />Until 2021, the credit was $2,000 per child under age 17, based on the child’s age at the end of the year. For 2021 only, Congress increased the credit to $3,000 for children ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for children under age 6.<br />On the low end, there were limits, but they have been removed for this year. Until 2021, low-income households that didn’t owe income taxes could get up to $1,400 of the $2,000 credit. This year, they can get the full credit even if they have no income.<br />On the high end, some limits are still in place. The expanded portion of the credit starts phasing out once income reaches $75,000 for individuals, $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married couples. The base $2,000 credit for higher-income households remains, and that phases out once income reaches $200,000 for individuals and $400,000 for married couples.</td>

      <td>Emily Watson and Denise Gough star in a cerebral thriller from AMC+ about the conflict between a forensic psychiatrist and a hostile patient with amnesia accused of a horrific crime.</td>
      <td>Putting the perverse in reverse psychology, “Too Close” is a cerebral thriller aimed a bit more at the mind than the pulse. It also involves a crime usually considered insufficient for a multi-episode crime series, namely attempted murder. Only attempted? We’re grateful for small favors: On a night of teeming North London rain, Connie Mortensen (Denise Gough) drives through a drawbridge barricade, taking two small children with her into the water below. Later, she can recall almost nothing. “I can’t even remember where we are in our relationship,” she says to her husband. “At the end,” he says. She does not, understandably, have a lot of friends.<br />Ambulatory, but so bruised she looks tie-dyed, Connie meets a number of nonfriends during her pre-prosecution recovery—chief among them Emma Robertson (Emily Watson), who introduces herself to Connie as her forensic psychiatrist. “Well don’t you sound pleased with yourself,” the patient sneers. Emma, taken aback, has been dragooned into the Mortensen affair and may, in fact, be the most emotionally ill-equipped physician who could have been brought into the case. Whether that’s true will be revealed over time, and three episodes. What’s immediately clear is that Emma has taken on a patient who is not only unrepentant and belligerent but has a talent for taunting, needling, baiting and finding chinks in Emma’s carefully constructed armor. Emma has to assess Connie’s mental state and her “dissociative amnesia.” The duel is on.<br />“Too Close” is based on the novel by Natalie Daniels, which is the pen name of Clara Salaman, who created and wrote the show. It is artfully directed by Sue Tully, a veteran of U.K. series TV, who makes the Emma-Connie conflict central to the drama, but achieves a fluid use of flashbacks, all of which carry their own kinds of tension. Connie’s relationship with her husband, Karl (Jamie Sives), for instance, isn’t unhealthy, but it’s static and their eyes are wandering—in Connie’s case, across the street toward the beautiful Vanessa (Thalissa Teixeira), a mom whose lesbian relationship has just fallen apart and who is causing Connie a great deal of confusion. Emma is in a not dissimilar state—her marriage to Si (Risteard Cooper) has more or less run aground. Why? Even Connie, in her fevered brain, hasn’t figured that out by the end of episode 2.<br />Ms. Watson has a history of delivering startling performances, but she’s the more understated partner in the “Too Close” pas de deux. It’s Ms. Gough who insists on our attention and has become my favorite actress of the moment (see her performance in the recently released romance “Monday”). Credit should go to Ms. Salaman for creating the character of Connie, who is a singular creature—despicable, pathetic and a challenge to one’s sense of charity. At the same time, she’s fascinating: How did she become what she is? Why did she do what she did? It’s impossible not to fixate on the answers. Ms. Gough’s contribution, among several, is making Connie impossible not to watch.<br /></td>

      <td>AT&T’s media spinoff shows how wrong the trustbusters were.</td>
      <td>AT&T ’s  acquisition of Time Warner three years ago was supposed to entrench its media empire—or at least that was the theory of the Trump Justice Department. Well, both AT&T’s media empire and the government’s antitrust case have now unraveled.<br />The telecom giant announced plans on Monday to spin off and combine its WarnerMedia assets with Discovery. The spinoff will free up cash for AT&T to pay down its staggering $169 billion in debt from its acquisitions of Time Warner and DirecTV in 2015 and invest more in its broadband network. The transaction is an implicit admission that the acquisition was a strategic failure.<br />AT&T’s motivation for buying Time Warner was to mine user data to better target ads at viewers. Justice argued in its lawsuit that AT&T would use “its control over Time Warner’s valuable and highly popular networks to hinder its rivals” and “impede disruptive competition” from “emerging online competition.”<br />According to Justice, AT&T would withhold Time Warner’s “premium” content like “Game of Thrones” from competitors in order to steer customers to its DirecTV satellite service. Yet DirecTV was already losing customers to the streaming competition, and  Netflix  hardly needed government protection.<br />Courts eventually waved through the deal, and none of Justice’s parade of horribles happened. DirecTV’s customer attrition accelerated, prompting AT&T to spin it off in February. AT&T’s HBO Max streaming service (17.2 million subscribers) has trailed Netflix (207.6 million),  Amazon  Prime (200 million),  Disney  Plus (103.6 million) and Hulu (37.8 million).</td>
