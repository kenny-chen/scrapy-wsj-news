      <td>Dolly Parton, Keith Urban and other musical greats join the surviving Bee Gee to revisit the pop-giant group’s catalog.</td>
      <td><br /><br />Throughout the genres’ marketing history, there have been hardcore devotees of country music and folk-style balladry who favor either or both to the exact extent they sound distant from general contemporary pop. For about as long, others have been attracted to some record (or performer) with country connections precisely because of its conspicuous pop propensities. That divide has made for decades of arguments. But actual country-pop divergence is often more in the mind than on the tracks, as an endearing new salute to the songs of the pop-giant Bee Gees—brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb—demonstrates anew.<br />For the vocal and instrumental collaborations with surviving brother Barry that make up “Greenfields: The Gibb Brothers Songbook (Vol. 1),” set for release Jan. 8 on Capitol Records, the singer-songwriter and Nashville producer Dave Cobb has called on luminaries from the more rural-friendly end of the roots-music spectrum. Some are most associated with country music (Dolly Parton, Miranda Lambert, Keith Urban, Little Big Town), some with Americana (Jason Isbell, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Brandi Carlile), and others with global country-friendly pop (Sheryl Crow, Olivia Newton-John) or rock (Jay Buchanan of the band Rival Sons).<br />Ten of the dozen songs they revisit were enormous, familiar Bee Gees hits—’60s ballads (“Words,” “To Love Somebody”) and their dominating ’70s R&B/disco smashes (“How Deep Is Your Love,” “Jive Talkin’”). The album title comes from the brothers’ more obscure, rural-leaning song “Butterfly,” worked up when they were in their early teens, and there’s one previously unheard number, “Words of a Fool,” written by Barry, solo, in 1986.</td>

      <td>SAVANNAH, Ga.—Georgians were bracing for Tuesday’s Senate runoff elections with their state in the political spotlight after President Trump urged state officials in a weekend phone call to nullify President-elect Joe Biden’s win in the November vote.<br />Gabriel Sterling, voting system implementation manager at the Georgia Secretary of State’s office, on Monday debunked inaccurate claims by the president and his allies about fraud in the state’s Nov. 3 election during a news conference at the State Capitol.<br />Mr. Trump’s campaign and a Trump elector previously said that data indicated that more than 66,000 voters under the age of 18 illegally voted. But state officials found that no underage voters cast ballots, Mr. Sterling said.<br />“This is all easily, provably false. Yet the president persists and, by doing so, undermines Georgians’ faith in the election system,” Mr. Sterling said.<br />Mr. Trump’s campaign earlier said as many as 2,560 felons voted illegally. Mr. Sterling said Monday that state officials have access to better data. He said 74 potential cases are under investigation but some of those people may have been eligible to vote for reasons such as having completed their sentences.</td>

Customers were experiencing problems loading channels and connecting to Slack, the company said Monday morning.<br />The San Francisco-based company was able to restore access for most of its affected users by midafternoon with limited performance issues. “We’re seeing improvements with error rates on our side, and we believe affected customers should be able to access Slack,” the company said.<br />Slack said it was still working to resolve issues with the functionality of some calendar apps as well as troubles with email notifications. It recommended users refresh or restart the application to see if there is an improvement.<br />Temporary interruptions for popular online services are relatively common, but their effects are being felt more as many employees turn to cloud services and other connected platforms to help them work remotely amid the pandemic.</td>

But on Monday, Richmond, Va.-based insurer  Genworth  said a year-end 2020 deadline to complete the transaction with Beijing-based China Oceanwide wasn’t extended—after 16 previous extensions.<br />While the companies didn’t cancel the merger agreement, the move indicates the long-running affair could end without a marriage.<br />Genworth said one stumbling block has been the deal’s financing, which was to be partially supplied by Hony Capital, a Chinese private-equity firm. A Hony Capital representative declined to comment.<br />Genworth said the Covid-19 pandemic “and associated restrictions” also delayed the deal’s closing.</td>

      <td>Nearly 200 top U.S. business leaders pressed Congress to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral victory in a letter Monday, the latest attempt by corporate executives to publicly urge a smooth transition of power as President Trump and many Republicans continue to dispute the election results.<br />The letter, sent by the Partnership for New York City, which represents the city’s business leaders and largest employers, called on Congress to certify the electoral vote on Wednesday as the nation continues to reel from the coronavirus pandemic.<br />“Attempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy,” the letter said. “Our duly elected leaders deserve the respect and bipartisan support of all Americans at a moment when we are dealing with the worst health and economic crises in modern history.”<br />Among the roughly 170 business leaders who signed the letter are the heads of financial firm  BlackRock Inc.,  consultancy Deloitte, airline  JetBlue Airways Corp.  and pharmaceutical company  Pfizer Inc.,  according to a release sent by the partnership. The group includes a number of Fortune 500 companies across industries as well as New York-based financial services firms and law firms.<br />Eleven current and incoming Republican senators said this weekend that they would vote to reject the Electoral College votes of some states on Wednesday as not “lawfully certified” unless Congress appoints a commission to conduct an emergency, 10-day audit of the election results. Although none of the challenges are expected to succeed, they could slow the process and give Mr. Trump’s allies a high-profile opportunity to demonstrate their loyalty to him.</td>

Haven’s stated aim at its 2018 launch was to provide transparent health care for employees of the companies at lower costs.<br />The joint venture, which was announced with enough fanfare to push down the shares of major insurers, will cease operations in February without having achieved those aims.<br />“The Haven team made good progress exploring a wide range of health-care solutions, as well as piloting new ways to make primary care easier to access, insurance benefits simpler to understand and easier to use and prescription drugs more affordable,” a spokeswoman said. The three companies will be able to use what they learned and collaborate informally in the future, she said.<br />Writer, surgeon and Harvard University professor Atul Gawande was named Haven’s chief executive, but he stepped down in May, saying he would become executive chairman and wanted to focus on the pandemic. Dr. Gawande, who took the head role in July 2018, wanted to move away from day-to-day management of Haven, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

      <td>The Speaker changes House procedures to increase spending and stifle dissent.</td>
      <td>Georgia voters, you can’t say Nancy Pelosi hasn’t warned you. The Speaker of the House is clarifying today that without a Republican Senate to serve as a check on her chamber, the 117th Congress is prepared to follow the fiscal blowout of 2020 with another historic surge in federal spending and debt. New House rules will eliminate one of the few modest institutional restraints on government budgets and further reduce the power of minority Republicans to impede the Pelosi agenda.<br />For anyone who’s been wondering whether the loss of Democratic House seats in November’s elections might encourage the Speaker to run a less partisan and less ideological House, you have your answer. Mrs. Pelosi has now endorsed a budgeting rule championed by radical Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.). The basic idea is to make every liberal priority eligible for “emergency” spending and remove it from any debate about government priorities.<br />Not that the rules enacted to this point by Speaker Pelosi and her predecessors have offered much resistance to the fleecing of taxpayers. The pile of publicly held U.S. Treasury debt is now larger than our entire economy and Washington’s unfunded entitlement promises are many times larger than that.<br />But when Mrs. Pelosi reclaimed the speaker’s gavel in 2019, she felt the need to maintain at least the appearance of being concerned about reckless federal borrowing. Amid a flourish of pronouncements about transparency and government reform, two years ago the Speaker angered Rep. Ocasio-Cortez with the re-imposition of a House rule purporting to require that new spending be offset by budget savings elsewhere.<br />The Speaker seems to have concluded that transparency and reform are overrated.

      <td>Booster shot marks milestone for state, but slow rollout prompts efforts to accelerate and widen vaccination campaign</td>
      <td>The first New Yorker to be given a Covid-19 vaccine received a booster shot on Monday, marking a milestone in a statewide vaccination rollout that has so far fallen short of its targets at a time hospitalizations are racing higher.<br />After a colleague’s short prayer, Sandra Lindsay, a nurse at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, received her second dose of the  Pfizer -BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, 21 days after her first. Ms. Lindsay, who had no side effects from the first dose, said she has received mail from schoolchildren and strangers thanking her for volunteering to publicly take the vaccine.<br />“It’s our civil responsibility in a crisis to just band together and get through this,” she said. “Covid-19 has stripped us of our lives, our livelihoods, and 2021 is our opportunity to reclaim that.”<br />The milestone came as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats, announced measures to accelerate vaccinations to combat the pandemic. New York has recorded more than 395,000 new cases of Covid-19 since Thanksgiving, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. More than 8,200 people were hospitalized across the state on Monday, up from 3,103 people on Thanksgiving, Mr. Cuomo said.<br />Health officials across the U.S. are in a race to get the vaccines out as the number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 continues to reach all-time highs and several states have reported cases of a fast-spreading new variant of Covid-19. The variant was first detected in the U.K. and is thought to be more transmissible. By nearly every measure, December was the worst month since the pandemic started. And some experts expect that trend to continue into January because of holiday travel and gatherings.</td>

      <td>A group of Google employees has formed a union to organize workers across the technology company’s sprawling global operations, a rare move within Silicon Valley and one that reflects growing employee activism in the sector.<br />Representatives said the Alphabet Workers Union—which is currently backed by around 200 workers, a tiny fraction of the tech company’s more than 132,000 employees—will be affiliated with Communications Workers of America Local 1400, and is the first one open to employees and contractors at any  Alphabet Inc.  company. The union will be supported by members paying 1% of their annual base pay and bonus every year, organizers said.<br />Google employees are among the best-paid workers in American corporations and enjoy ample perks. Median pay at Alphabet, whose operations include a range of internet businesses, was $258,708 in 2019, according to company filings.<br />Organizing efforts began over a year ago, part of a continuing tide of activism within Google. Members said the union’s immediate goal isn’t collective bargaining or formal recognition by Alphabet. The push instead reflects a need for employees to be able to speak out about the company without facing career repercussions, they said.<br />In 2018, thousands of employees staged a walkout to protest a workplace culture that they said promotes and protects perpetrators of sexual harassment. Employees had previously also criticized the company’s work with the Defense Department and its plan to explore a censored search engine for Chinese citizens.</td>

Last month, they agreed to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day, bringing their net cuts since the start of the pandemic to some 7.2 million barrels a day.<br />On Monday, they were scheduled to decide whether to continue to raise production or stand pat.<br />Saudi Arabia and most of the broader alliance backed holding steady for at least another month, delegates said. These countries are concerned a new variant of the Covid-19 virus is threatening a resurgence of the pandemic, while vaccination programs are not progressing as fast as expected.<br />“Even in this general optimistic environment, I want to urge caution,” Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said during opening remarks before the online meetings. “Do not put at risk what we have achieved for the sake of an instant illusionary benefit.”</td>

Those days are over.<br />China’s economic growth in 2020 significantly outpaced the U.S. and all other major economies, which suffered severe recessions. China’s recent adventurism at home and abroad can be explained largely in economic terms. Its leaders draw confidence to challenge the world from their country’s macroeconomic outperformance, and from their growing belief in the superiority of China’s economic governance model.<br />A new front in the great power competition between the U.S. and China has opened. Beijing isn’t yet ready to challenge the U.S. dollar directly. But it has set its sights on the U.S. bond market, which showed new vulnerability last year. China is taking steps to displace U.S. Treasurys as the world’s most important and reliable asset. American policy makers should take notice.<br />There are signs that China is starting to reduce its direct purchases of Treasurys. This is difficult to know precisely: China’s official foreign exchange reserves total more than $3 trillion, and it controls other massive pools of capital. The composition of China’s foreign reserves and the amount of its dollar-denominated assets are a state secret.<br />But, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Treasury Department, Chinese direct holdings of U.S. government debt fell in each of the past five months, and are now at the lowest level in nearly five years. The share of new U.S. debt bought by China is smaller than it’s been in decades.</td>

The Republican-led Senate acquitted the president.<br />In a news release, the White House praised Mr. Nunes for his role in attempting to discredit investigations of the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia, calling him “a public servant of unmatched talent, unassailable integrity, and unwavering resolve.”<br />In a 2019 report, special counsel Robert Mueller confirmed that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election and detailed contacts between the Russian operatives and members of the Trump campaign, but said the evidence didn’t establish a conspiracy or coordination between the two.</td>

      <td>Party is split on challenging Biden’s presidential election win at joint session of Congress on Wednesday</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Trump disparaged Senate Republicans who aren’t backing further challenges to Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential election victory, jumping into a fight that has split the party ahead of a joint session of Congress to certify the winner.<br />“The ‘Surrender Caucus’ within the Republican Party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective ‘guardians’ of our Nation,” he tweeted Monday, calling them “willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers!”<br />Mr. Trump has blamed voter fraud for his defeat, but no significant evidence emerged that would challenge the result. Then Attorney General William Barr said last month the Justice Department hadn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud that could reverse Mr. Biden’s election victory. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the November election results that delivered the state to Mr. Biden.<br />Mr. Trump’s comments came as a dozen Republican senators, under intense pressure from Trump supporters, have said they would challenge certification of Mr. Biden’s win despite the Republican leaders’ pleas not to do so.<br />It takes one House lawmaker and one senator to object to a state’s electoral votes in writing on Jan. 6. The objection, once filed, triggers two hours of concurrent debate and votes in each chamber. Majorities in the House and Senate have to agree for the challenge to be successful in rejecting any state’s results.</td>

However, investigators determined the items found in the vehicle constituted a hoax bomb intended to cause a disruption, according to police officials.<br />A spokeswoman for Queens Place Mall said the mall remained closed Monday while police and the New York Fire Department continued their investigation.<br />The investigation led to the closure of nearby roads for roughly two hours. The evacuation orders and road closures began to be lifted around 10 a.m., police officials said.</td>

      <td>The abrupt move underscores the European Union’s broader plan to bolster its own financial centers</td>
      <td>The fallout from Britain’s split from the European Union showed itself on the first trading day of the year as a big chunk of dealing volume in EU stocks moved from London to venues located in Amsterdam, Paris and the Continent’s other financial centers.<br />Britain’s membership of the EU had meant the region’s banks and investors could bypass the home exchanges of stocks such as Paris-listed luxury-goods giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and Amsterdam-listed  Just Eat Takeaway.com  NV, the big food-delivery company, and trade them in London over alternative venues. Those venues included Turquoise, a trading facility majority-owned by the  London Stock Exchange Group  PLC, and rival platforms Aquis Exchange PLC and Cboe Global Markets Inc.’s Europe-based marketplace.<br />But with the Brexit trade agreement taking effect Jan. 1, that option ended.<br />The bloc pushed for greater control over the trading of EU stocks during Brexit negotiations as part of its efforts to better compete with London, historically Europe’s dominant financial center.<br />Trading venues had been ready for the post-Brexit shift of EU stock trading volume. The LSE’s Turquoise, for example, at the end of November set up a European hub in Amsterdam to trade European stocks. Cboe also has a hub in Amsterdam. Aquis operates a platform in Paris for the same reason. While the operations therefore look unlikely to suffer, at least in the short term, volumes leaving London send a signal that other city centers can compete effectively and support comparable services without hiccups.</td>

      <td>As the podcasting industry has grown, so has its merchandise market. And it’s not just T-shirts and totes for these fledgling ‘lifestyle brands’</td>
      <td>IN THE LAST couple decades, podcasting has gone from a nascent audio curiosity to a media monster. Prominent shows like “The Joe Rogan Experience,” “Crime Junkie” and “Stuff You Should Know” garner tens of millions of weekly downloads. These empires now extend beyond their listeners’ earbuds. Popular podcasts have robust social media followings, sell out live recordings (in pre-Covid times, of course) and run fully fleshed-out merchandise operations.<br />The podcast merch business, in particular, is soaring, as more listeners want to show their allegiance to their podcast of choice through a T-shirt, mug or hoodie. Marisa Morales, the head of merchandising at Stitcher, a podcast conglomerate, said that sales of merchandise associated with Stitcher shows like “WTF with Marc Maron,” “Sklarbro Country” and “Freakonomics Radio” are roughly doubling every year. She likened the excitement surrounding, say, a newly launched mug from “The Office Ladies,” a podcast about the bygone sitcom, to the frenetic hype around the release of Air Jordan sneakers. Hundreds of coffee cups can sell out in hours.<br />This fervent merchandise market has no parallel in traditional media. Newspapers and periodicals still sweeten subscription deals with giveaways—many of us have New Yorker tote bags languishing in our closets, or own that “ESPN the Magazine” fleece that was advertised heavily on TV during the aughts. But podcast merchandise operates as a standalone phenomenon that sees listeners plop down $30 just for a T-shirt or $60 for a hoodie. As Ms. Morales said, merch appeals because it makes a listener’s connection to a podcast tangible.<br />In this sense, the closest cousin to podcast merch is band T-shirts. Dita Cordelia, 24, a freelance video producer and dedicated podcast listener in Los Angeles, likened her Scriptnotes shirt—denoting her devotion to a weekly podcast on screenwriting—to the Morrissey T-shirt she wore in high school. In both instances, she said, the shirts emit an insider (some would say hipster) message of “Oh you don’t know about this...you have to listen to this.”<br />And like concert T-shirts, podcast gear lets listeners back their favorite sources of entertainment. “It’s supporting something I’m into,” said Corey Long, 40, a contract coordinator at an Atlanta university, who recently purchased a shirt from upstart podcast “How Long Gone,” hosted by two elder millennial bros. (In the case of larger shows with mammoth audiences, it’s sales of ads, not merch, that typically keep the mics on.) Mr. Long concedes that, unlike buying concert shirts while surrounded by a swarm of fellow fans, purchasing podcast merch isn’t a “shared experience.” You’re at home alone, listening in isolation.</td>

Second, mandates and incentives to use renewable energy will turn energy producers from profit makers into rent seekers, generating returns from government largesse. Increases in the legally required percentage of renewable energy in the electricity stream raise corporate profits in tandem with consumer energy costs.<br />This is what Ms. Granholm did as governor of Michigan.

Outright repeal of Section 230, which grants immunity from liability to internet platforms for content posted on their sites by third parties, would prompt even more censorship. The social-media companies would try to protect themselves from litigation over all kinds of potentially offensive or illegal content that users post.<br />Since the First Amendment is a well-litigated line between permissible and impermissible speech consistent with the values of a free society, it offers the best solution for regulating the social-media companies. The government should condition the grant of immunity under Section 230 on a pledge from the platforms not to censor third-party content unless it falls outside the protections of the First Amendment, such as libel, threats to overthrow the government, direct threats of physical violence and certain types of indecent material. Censoring “hate speech” or content suspected of originating with hackers couldn’t meet this standard because such speech is within the protection of the First Amendment. Any internet provider that refused to adopt this policy would lose the protections of Section 230 entirely.<br />Robert Goodfriend<br />Dallas<br /></td>

      <td>Percolating policy ideas like postal banking and digital wallets via the Fed give a hint of how Washington could reshape the banking business</td>
      <td>Historically, investors in banks would be worried about stepped-up financial regulation from a new Democratic administration. This time around, however, a bigger long-term worry might be government efforts that could disrupt banking itself.<br />There are a handful of measures either working their way through agencies or being discussed in Democratic policy circles aimed at broadening access to financial services, which could force traditional banks to compete more—either with the government, technology upstarts, or both in combination.<br />Postal banking is one intriguing example. The notion of offering basic banking services via the post office had the support of several Democratic contenders, and some advocates have had roles in President-elect Joe Biden’s transition. Major new legal powers granting the U.S. Postal Service license to make loans or hold deposits may be politically complex. But things like installing ATMs, facilitating bill payments or expanding electronic money transfer services at post offices may be more feasible.<br />Some banking industry groups have opposed postal banking, arguing consumers could be left vulnerable. But moves to broaden banking access might generate support among other constituencies, perhaps from rural representatives, or in Silicon Valley: Digital players could see post offices as de facto branches, helping people that don’t use traditional banks move cash into and out of their virtual wallets.<br />There are other ideas that could further enable a new kind of banking ecosystem to evolve. One that has been making its way into potential legislation is to create accounts for individuals with the help of the Federal Reserve. Some propose this in conjunction with postal banking. Additionally, the Fed is in the early stages of developing its own real-time payments system. Depending on how it is fleshed out, that could compete with some existing forms of bank payments.</td>

      <td>Amid the president’s loyalty test, the unanswerable question is whether he can maintain his hold on the party once out of office</td>
      <td>Less than two years from now, after this week’s attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election has long since played out, here is a plausible scenario:<br />A Republican senator or House member, one party leaders are eager to see retain his or her seat, will be challenged in a primary by a disciple of President Trump. The incumbent, after being attacked as a member of a disparaged party establishment, will still win the primary. But that outcome will be challenged by Republican rebels, who, taking a cue from what is happening right now, will charge that the election was “rigged” by the establishment, and go to court to try to overturn it.<br />Such are the forces being unleashed this week within the GOP, where the prospect of a virtual civil war suddenly feels real. This internal struggle engages the president and his family; lawmakers courting the support of Trump loyalists; and a conservative Republican establishment embodied by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Part of the struggle is ideological, part is simply about power. In any case, it figures to roll through the next two years and into the 2022 mid-term election.<br />The irony is that Republicans might instead be uniting in celebration over what actually was a good outcome for them in the 2020 vote, and allowing attention to focus on Democrats’ own considerable internal ideological schisms. Instead, the party is being pulled apart in the last days of the Trump term.<br />Mr. Trump is setting up this week as a dramatic test of loyalty to him in the form of his last-ditch effort to overturn the victory of President-elect Joe Biden, and his core supporters will be rallying in Washington to underscore the point. Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas, who aspire to lead the Trump army whenever Mr. Trump isn’t there to do so himself, have engineered a scenario in which each of their colleagues will have to go on record either favoring or opposing the president’s effort to reverse the election.</td>

      <td>Investors are right to be skeptical about China’s economic data. Here’s how to interpret it.</td>
      <td>The world’s second-largest economy is incredibly influential—trends in China help determine everything from the global prices of steel and pork to the balance of military power in the Taiwan Strait. It is also widely misunderstood.<br />While skepticism of China’s official figures is widespread, and justifiably so, some of the more granular official data are actually very useful. The picture can and does change over time: When a certain economic data point becomes a political target in China, the incentives for officials to fudge it rise. Still, understanding the lay of the land can help investors spot suspicious deviations from trend—or changes in reporting—that might be an indication of problems officials would prefer to sweep under the rug.<br />Probably the simplest method is to pay more attention to nominal growth—or new output before adjusting for changes in prices—than the top-line “real” growth figure, both for gross domestic product and narrower indicators such as industrial output. There are three reasons. First, real growth has long been one of the ways officials are evaluated in China, and so there is a strong incentive to inflate it—and substantial evidence that has happened, particularly during downturns. For instance, after the housing and commodity market downturn of 2015 and early 2016, China’s Inner Mongolia province—a major coal producer—admitted that its 2016 industrial growth had been overstated by 40%.<br />Second, official statisticians use some questionable assumptions for the price adjustments to “real” growth. Oxford Economics notes that unlike the U.S. and Germany, which use more precise inflation indexes to adjust industrial growth in their national accounts, China relies on its producer-price index, which is strongly influenced by heavy industry and commodity prices. That could create problems if, for example, steel and coal prices fall substantially but more profitable, fast-growing sectors such as electronics or pharmaceuticals don’t see their prices change as much.<br />Most important, nominal growth lines up far better than so-called real growth with other cyclical indicators that aren’t controlled by government statisticians—like global metal prices and the profits of listed Chinese companies. That makes it more credible.</td>

      <td>U.S. stock futures rose on the first major trading day of 2021 on hopes that continued government stimulus and the rollout of coronavirus vaccines will bode well for equities.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed about 0.4%, pointing to gains for both gauges after the opening bell. The benchmark indexes closed at record levels Dec. 31. Nasdaq-100 futures also added 0.4% Monday, suggesting a rise in technology stocks.<br />Investors are starting the new year on an optimistic note, amid expectations that the widespread rollout of coronavirus vaccines will allow economic activity to return to pre-pandemic levels. Stocks have been buoyed in recent weeks on such bets even as the pandemic continues to spread, with hospitalization rates in the U.S. climbing to a record high Sunday.<br />“There is still really bad news on the virus, but the market is looking through that because of the vaccines,” said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. “We are certainly positively tilted, given the expected economic recovery, historically low interest rates, a lot of fiscal spending and monetary policy to come: all of that positivity remains.”<br />In premarket trading, Tesla climbed 2% after the electric-car maker said it delivered a record 499,550 cars last year, just shy of its half a million target.</td>

      <td>SEOUL—South Korea’s population decreased for the first time in 2020, entering a downward trend that is likely to be worsened by the pandemic.<br />South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, reported a population of 51.8 million last year, a drop of 20,838 people from 2019, according to government data released Sunday, measuring citizen registration numbers.<br />Leading the population drop is South Korea’s low number of births. Births have fallen to record lows every year since 2016. The average number of children a woman will bear in her lifetime in South Korea was 1.1 last year, the lowest fertility rate in the world, according to a United Nations Population Fund’s survey of more than 200 countries.<br />Statistics Korea, South Korea’s statistics arm, initially predicted the country’s population would enter into decline in 2021 after accounting for other population-change factors, such as immigration.<br />But the pandemic, which hammered jobs and forced couples to delay marriages, is likely to have weighed on birth rates, especially in South Korea where the majority of child births occur after marriage, said Choi Seong-soo, a sociology professor at Yonsei University in Seoul.</td>

      <td>In the coming days, the New York Stock Exchange will start to delist American depositary receipts in China’s three big telecommunications operators. Here are some of the key questions this raises for investors.<br />What does delisting mean?<br />Delisting means shares are removed from a stock exchange and investors can no longer buy or sell them there. A delisting can be voluntary or involuntary. For example, in 2019 China’s  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. , a big chip maker whose shares mostly traded in Hong Kong, scrapped its less-active listing on the NYSE. Conversely, last year the  Nasdaq Stock Market forced China’s Luckin Coffee Inc. to delist after an accounting scandal.<br />In this case, the NYSE will delist ADRs from  China Mobile Ltd. ,  China Telecom Corp.  and China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. against the companies’ wishes.<br />What are Chinese ADRs?</td>

The strike followed a year of spiraling hostilities in the region that included explosions on oil tankers and an attack on key Saudi oil facilities that the U.S. blamed on Iran.<br />Iranian forces also seized a South Korea-flagged ship on Monday, according to a semiofficial Iranian news agency, further heightening tensions with a U.S. ally. Forces boarded the vessel because it was creating unspecified pollution in the Persian Gulf, the agency said. The vessel’s owner, DM Shipping of Busan, South Korea, didn’t respond to calls.</td>

The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects the smallest domestic crop in five years.<br />The weather in Texas—the country’s top cotton-producing state—has been especially challenging for farmers.

      <td>SEOUL—Contract-manufacturing companies working to accelerate the global availability of Covid-19 vaccines are struggling with a shortage of their own: There aren’t enough workers to meet this year’s big production push.<br />The talent pool is so tight that  Emergent BioSolutions Inc.,  a Covid-19 contractor based in Gaithersburg, Md., for  AstraZeneca  PLC and  Johnson & Johnson ,  enlisted its CEO and a half-dozen other senior executives to pitch potential hires at a virtual career fair in October. More than 550 people attended.<br />Not enough of them were swayed. More than two months later, Emergent still has roughly 200 openings for warehouse associates, quality-assurance analysts and even a supply-chain management director. “Hiring and ramping up has become challenging,” said Sean Kirk, an Emergent executive vice president, who spoke at the event.<br />Outsourcing companies such as Emergent make about one-sixth of complex treatments including vaccines, but the scale and abruptness of Covid-19 shots is likely to boost that share much higher, say industry executives and experts. With demand dwarfing supply,  Pfizer Inc.,   Moderna Inc.  and others are turning to contract manufacturers for assistance in what is the largest pharmaceutical rollout in modern history.<br />But those helping drugmakers need more help themselves. More than 5,000 open jobs exist at the world’s 10 largest companies that have won Covid-19 outsourcing work, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of the companies’ websites. The firms were ranked by production capacity.</td>

The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate bond index climbed 9.2% on a total return basis.<br />That is significantly better than the performance of many alternative investments. This asset class includes hedge funds, private equity and more exotic investments such as classic cars, fine wine and other luxury goods. Investors typically put money into these riskier bets to boost their overall returns. But that strategy was turned on its head last year.<br />The meltdown in markets in March pushed central banks into action, unleashing colossal amounts of monetary stimulus and a series of interest rate cuts around the world. This wave of cheap money propelled many stocks and bonds to all-time highs.<br />With all this new money in the financial system, some investors channeled more capital into alternatives. But on average, hedge funds returned 6.3% in 2020, according to research and intelligence firm PivotalPath. Global private equity declined nearly 9% as industries such as retail and hospitality were hit by the pandemic and leveraged bets went sour. Some luxury goods gained as investors bought them as havens, but typically generated single-digit annual returns.</td>

      <td>Pandemic led to year of strong sales despite flops and delays and 2021 will likely start out the same</td>
      <td>While most businesses are understandably pleased to see 2020 pass, videogame companies might have some mixed feelings.<br />The coronavirus pandemic has been an undeniable boon for the game industry. Restrictions that have kept many at home and shut down other forms of entertainment have resulted in a banner year for the sector. Six of the largest game publishers are expected to post combined total revenue of $24 billion for the calendar year, up 19% from last year, according to consensus estimates compiled by FactSet. In 2019, the same group’s combined revenue fell nearly 3%.<br />That number doesn’t include sales of the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles, which went on sale in early November and are still very hard to come by due to soaring demand. Other game-hardware makers also have been capitalizing on the rush.  Turtle Beach ,  which makes accessories such as specialty headphones for gamers, has recorded a 71% year-over-year sales gain to $227 million for the nine-month period ended September. Newly public  Corsair Gaming ,  which makes gaming PCs and laptops and other related accessories, logged a 54% revenue jump to about $1.2 billion for the same period.<br />For game makers, the current sales boom has been especially remarkable considering the impact the pandemic has had on their development cycles. Several major games got delayed in 2020 due to the challenges imposed by remote working. That included the annual entry to  Activision Blizzard ’s  blockbuster “Call of Duty” franchise. The game, “Black Ops Cold War,” launched a few weeks later than normal and has garnered among the franchise’s lowest critic scores in more than a decade. But Cowen analyst Doug Creutz notes the game is still on track to sell more than 20 million units. Analysts estimate Activision’s publishing business, which comprises mainly the “Call of Duty” franchise, will show a 74% surge in net bookings for 2020, to nearly $3.9 billion, according to FactSet.<br />Even 2020’s flops have been relative. In a Dec. 22 regulatory disclosure, Polish game publisher  CD Projekt  reported unit sales of its problem-plagued “Cyberpunk 2077” totaled more than 13 million copies since its Dec. 10 launch. That is well below the 18 million to 25 million units that Jefferies analyst Ken Rumph said Wall Street had been expecting the title to sell in its debut. But it isn’t bad for a game so riddled with bugs that both  Sony  and  Microsoft  dropped it from their online stores and joined other retailers in offering refunds to disgruntled players. Analysts still expect CD Projekt to post the equivalent of about $672 million in revenue for 2020—more than five times the previous year’s sales, according to FactSet.</td>

A lawyer for the U.S. government said it would appeal, setting the stage for another hearing in the coming months at the High Court in London.<br />Delivering her ruling Monday after months of sporadic hearings because of the coronavirus pandemic, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser said Mr. Assange has already toyed with suicide and the prospect of detention in isolation in the U.S. would likely rekindle those thoughts. She said he has the intellect and determination to get around anti-suicide protocols in U.S. jails.<br />“The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man who is genuinely fearful about his future,” she said, rejecting the U.S. extradition request.<br />In her ruling, Judge Baraitser rejected all of Mr. Assange’s other defenses against extradition, saying there was no reason to think he wouldn’t get a fair trial and the offenses he was alleged to have committed would be prosecutable in the U.K., too.</td>

The firm processed 2.2 million trades a day through September 2020, nearly twice what it had during the year-earlier period, and has added more than 3.5 million new accounts since the end of 2019.<br />Fidelity’s tally of new accounts ticked even higher in the fourth quarter, according to the firm.<br />But there is a big caveat. A large chunk of the new money coming in pays little or no commissions or fees. Fidelity’s strategy has been to attract as many new investors to its platform as possible with low- or no-cost services.

But the group is assessing individual economies’ demands and expects to provide an update early in the year, a Gavi spokesman said.<br />In recent weeks, North Korea has reached out to several European embassies, inquiring how the country might obtain Covid-19 vaccines, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Gavi said last month that it had received detailed vaccine requests from 86 of 92 lower-income countries and economies eligible for the Covax Advance Market Commitment program, which is aiming for equitable distribution of vaccines. For that group, which includes North Korea, Covax has secured at least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses, targeting coverage of up to 20% of the population by the end of 2021.<br />North Korea hasn’t reported a single Covid-19 case. The Kim Jong Un regime has called combating the virus a matter of national survival. It has sealed off its borders and suspended foreign travel. Last week, state media warned of the new variant of the coronavirus, urging citizens to be on “maximum alert.”</td>

      <td>Sector’s strength in Europe and Asia contrasts with services harmed by pandemic restrictions; U.S. figures due on Monday</td>
      <td>Factories in Asia and Europe increased their output as 2020 drew to a close, aided by a revival in trade that has continued despite a sharp rise in new coronavirus infections across many large economies.<br />The resilience of the global manufacturing sector contrasts with weakness in services businesses that rely on close physical proximity, and which have suffered as consumers try to lower their risk of infection and governments impose restrictions on their behavior.<br />Economists expect that divergence to be a feature of the global economy well into 2021, and until vaccines are distributed broadly enough to ensure widespread immunity against Covid-19.<br />Surveys of purchasing managers at factories across Asia and Europe that were released Monday recorded strong rises in activity during December, with Taiwan’s manufacturing sector recording its strongest month in almost a decade. The results of a similar survey of U.S. manufacturers, to be released later Monday, are expected to also point to a strong increase in activity.<br />While Europe has seen a rise in infections that will likely prompt governments to extend current restrictions, its manufacturers continued to report a recovery from the sharp declines in output that accompanied the pandemic’s first wave and the lockdowns that accompanied it.</td>

      <td>Billionaire is also relinquishing his seats on the nutritional-supplements company’s board</td>
      <td>Carl Icahn sold over half his stake in  Herbalife Nutrition Ltd.  and is relinquishing his seats on the nutritional-supplements company’s board, taking a step back from a longtime investment he fiercely defended against an onslaught from rival activist investor William Ackman.<br />Mr. Icahn sold about $600 million of his 16% Herbalife stake back to the company in recent days, the company said late Sunday, after The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the transaction. That leaves him with a roughly 6% stake, worth $400 million. Given that his holdings will go below the level stipulated in an agreement Mr. Icahn has with the company, he also plans to give up the five board seats currently held by his representatives, the company said.<br />The move helps cement a big win for the scrappy octogenarian billionaire, who is estimated to have made well over $1 billion on the investment.<br />Mr. Icahn has been Herbalife’s largest shareholder since 2013. He stuck with the company through challenges from Mr. Ackman and regulators and the resignation of its chief executive after he was caught on tape encouraging a colleague to skirt expense-account rules.<br />Mr. Icahn first bought into the stock in late 2012. The investment represented a high-profile challenge to Mr. Ackman, who had bet against the company and publicly crusaded against its business model, which relies on a network of distributors, calling it a pyramid scheme. The company has said it is a legal multi-level-marketing organization and fought him at every turn.</td>

But the service, which launched in April, never gained traction and Quibi said in October that it was shutting down.<br />Roku, which sells the most popular streaming-media player in the U.S., is pushing aggressively into content with its own ad-supported app, the Roku Channel, which offers movies and shows produced by other companies. A deal with Quibi would give Roku a roster of exclusive programming.<br />Under the terms the companies have discussed, Roku would acquire rights to Quibi’s library, the people familiar with the matter said. Financial terms of the proposed deal couldn’t be learned. The deal talks could still fall apart.<br />Quibi’s shows, with episodes less than 10 minutes in length, feature such stars as Anna Kendrick, Liam Hemsworth and Sophie Turner. The shows include “Most Dangerous Game,” a thriller about human-hunting; “Dummy,” a series about a talking sex doll; and “Murder House Flip,” a fusion of home-improvement programming and true-crime shows.</td>

He didn’t like the idea of high turnover rates or gambling on an untested venture amid the uncertainty of the pandemic. Instead, he starts this month as a software engineer at  IBM ,  founded in 1911.<br />“One of the most important things I was looking for in a company is the tenure of its employees,” the 27-year-old says. “At IBM, it tends to be around the five-to-seven year mark, and when I spoke with upper-level management, they discussed possible career paths for me and really emphasized growth within the company, which for me, as a millennial, is really important.”<br />Startup jobs in industries from payments to social media have become steadily more popular, says Lisa Cohen, an associate professor at McGill University’s business school who studies startups. Many young workers fantasize about getting in early at, say, the next  Facebook ,  tantalized by the rewards that come when a sink-or-swim enterprise proves itself viable.<br />But that allure was severely tested in a year dominated by the pandemic, which has thrown the economy into tumult and increased the desire of job seekers like Mr. Loftin for stability.</td>

Mr. Biden is expected to review the readiness of the troops and will then be escorted from 15th Street to the White House by members of the military.<br />With the coronavirus still raging across the country, the inauguration committee will be holding a virtual parade instead of the traditional in-person parade and balls. The planned programming is expected to feature Americans across the country along with musical acts, local bands and poets to pay tribute to front-line workers during the pandemic.<br />“There are many grand traditions to the inaugural and we plan to honor them by highlighting more of our nation’s people than ever before while keeping everyone safe,” said Tony Allen, chief executive of the inaugural committee, in a statement.<br />The committee said earlier this week it would host a memorial  on Jan. 19, ahead of the inauguration, to remember those who lost their lives to Covid-19. The memorial ceremony in Washington, D.C., will feature a lighting around the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool.</td>

He asked the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, a watchdog entity charged with enforcing state ethics laws, to investigate. Nearly three years later, the case is still pending. Mr. Klein is out of office and filed a lawsuit in state Supreme Court in Albany County last month saying JCOPE no longer has jurisdiction to pursue the matter because it waited too long to act and the alleged kiss wasn’t related to any government decision-making.<br />A ruling in his favor could limit JCOPE’s authority to investigate claims of sexual misconduct. For JCOPE critics such as state Sen. Liz Krueger, the continuing saga shows the need to create a better mechanism for complaints involving state officials.<br />“Clearly, it’s not working,” said Ms. Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan. “You want to go as high and independent as you possibly can get. And the dilemma, frankly, is that we don’t have that system.”<br />Jay Musoff, Mr. Klein’s lawyer, said he was “confident that any investigation would determine that Jeff did not abuse any state resources or that his alleged conduct did not affect state business.” Mr. Musoff said JCOPE was “kicking the can down the road.”</td>

      <td>The GOP stunt over the Electoral College will hurt the country and the party.</td>
      <td>As Americans like to tell the world, a hallmark of democracy is the willingness to accept defeat and the peaceful transfer of power. The tragedy of the last two presidential elections has been the refusal of partisans to accept defeat, and public trust in American self-government is eroding as a result.<br />Democrats in 2016 abused the FBI to push the Russia collusion myth and refused to accept Donald Trump’s legitimacy. Hillary Clinton still doesn’t. Now some Republicans are returning the disfavor by challenging the ritual counting of the Electoral College votes by the new Congress this week. Neither one justifies the other, and these columns have called out Democrats for their anti-democratic panic attack.<br />But the main issue now is that too many Republicans refuse to accept Mr. Trump’s defeat. More than 100 House Members and, as of this weekend, at least 12 Senators say they will formally object to the Electoral College count. This won’t change the result, though it will delay it as Congress spends up to two hours debating the objections to each state’s results. More corrosive will be the precedent and resulting political damage.<br />The leading culprit here is Mr. Trump, who as always refuses to accept responsibility for defeat. Recall that he also claimed the Iowa caucus result was stolen in 2016 when he lost to Ted Cruz. He’s now spinning conspiracy theories and election falsehoods daily on  Twitter .  He doesn’t seem to care what damage he does in promoting the myth of his victory.<br />The damage is spreading as Mr. Trump puts pressure on other Republicans to take up his lost cause. A dozen Senators have issued a statement demanding an Electoral Commission that would investigate claims of fraud and report within 10 days. The plan is to persuade state legislatures to overrule their Dec. 14 Electoral College certifications for Joe Biden. Throw the election into the House and Mr. Trump might salvage a second term.</td>

      <td>Biden is right to resist calls to forgive student debt by fiat.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden campaigned for legislation that would cancel $10,000 in student debt for each borrower. That’s the bad news. The good news is that he is resisting progressive calls to ram through $50,000 in student debt forgiveness for each borrower via executive fiat.<br />The Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty quotes Mr. Biden as skeptical of the progressive demand: “I’m going to get in trouble for saying this . . . for example, it’s arguable that the President may have the executive power to forgive up to $50,000 in student debt. Well, I think that’s pretty questionable. I’m unsure of that. I’d be unlikely to do that.”<br />When Mr. Biden says he’s going to get “in trouble,” he means with such allies as Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts Senator claims the President can cancel $50,000 in debt—and have taxpayers pick up the bill—without going through Congress.<br />A coalition of 238 progressive groups recently signed a letter urging Mr. Biden to invoke his “executive authority to cancel federal student debt on Day One of your administration.” Backing Sen. Warren’s plan, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says, “We have come to the conclusion that President Biden can undo this debt, can forgive $50,000 of debt the first day he becomes president. You don’t need Congress. All you need is the flick of a pen.”<br />We’d like to see the bill in which Congress said students could borrow and not pay it back. But Mr. Schumer is echoing Barack Obama’s notorious line in his second term that he could govern alone because “I’ve got a pen and I’ve got a phone.” And Mr. Obama tried, courting a political backlash that helped to elect Donald Trump.</td>

      <td>Chinese regulators are effectively breaking up Ant Group’s fin-tech empire, and there’s a lesson here for investors. Ant’s deconstruction is a reminder that businesses in China live or die at the sufferance of the Communist Party.<br />Jack Ma founded Ant in 2004 as “Alipay” to process payments for his e-commerce site Alibaba. He exploited the credit shortages in China’s state-dominated banking system by expanding into financial services such as insurance, money-management, personal credit ratings and consumer loans.<br />Party leaders tolerated Ant because it helped fuel their goal of making China’s economy more consumer-driven. But regulators have slapped down Ant at times when they think it is threatening the government’s control of capital—for instance, by limiting returns on Ant money-market funds that had drawn deposits from state banks.<br />Global investors in 2018 bought stakes in Ant—then valued at about $150 billion—to capitalize on China’s growth and government restrictions on foreign competition. Mr. Ma aimed to raise another $34 billion in an initial public offering, with estimates of Ant’s potential valuation at more than $300 billion.<br />The entrepreneur planned to launch the IPO on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges, which would draw more foreign capital to Chinese markets. But in October Mr. Ma apparently forgot he was in China and criticized Beijing’s financial controls. Regulators abruptly halted Ant’s IPO and presented Mr. Ma with a litany of vague grievances.</td>

      <td>The Constitutions is clear. Neither the vice president or Congress has the power to reject electoral votes.</td>
      <td>Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert has argued that the Electoral Count Act of 1887 is unconstitutional. Therefore, he claims, Vice President Mike Pence is empowered by the 12th Amendment to reject 73 Biden-Harris electoral votes from five states when Congress meets to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6. A dozen Republican senators and many more House members also argue that Congress has this power. They are all wrong.<br />Neither the vice president nor Congress has the power to reject electoral votes. This is because the 12th Amendment vests no power in the vice president or Congress to judge who won a state’s electoral votes when the authorized branches of the state’s government agree, as they do here, on which electors won.<br />The 12th Amendment left intact the Constitution’s Electors Clause. As the Supreme Court’s three originalist justices wrote in Bush v. Gore (2000), under the Electors Clause, each state’s legislature by statute makes the exclusive “apportionment of responsibility” to state officials to “oversee election disputes” that decide which presidential ticket won the most votes in that state. Election officials and courts from each of the five states in question did exactly that. And by Dec. 14, the states certified that the electors who won were those who voted for Biden-Harris.<br />All the 12th Amendment says is that in a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, “the [electoral] votes shall then be counted.” The word “counted” provides no basis for anyone to override anything. When a person counts the number of games his favorite team has won, that person has no power to alchemize losses into wins.<br />The narrow word “counted” also contrasts sharply with Congress’s constitutional powers concerning congressional elections. Section 5 of Article I expressly provides: “Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own members.” The 12th Amendment would not have used the much narrower word “counted” to give the vice president or Congress the power “to be the Judge” for presidential elections.</td>

      <td>To speed up vaccine distribution, let national chains like CVS and Walgreens take a role.</td>
      <td>The federal government built a Covid vaccine delivery scheme to track every dose shipped to the states. Information like location and travel history is available in a software platform developed for “Operation Warp Speed” called Tiberius, so that public-health officials can make sure the limited supply is allotted carefully and fairly.<br />These are important goals, but central control comes with a trade off: it slows down the process of getting shots into arms. Poor local and state planning hasn’t helped. Neither has the trickle of funds the feds have provided to stand up vaccination sites. Add it all up and you have the explanation for the sluggish pace of immunization. Fewer than 5 million people have been vaccinated so far, versus the 20 million promised. Here’s what’s needed to turn things around.<br />First, the government needs to ship more inventory. Right now, the feds are holding back up to 55% of doses. The idea is to make sure there is supply to give everyone a second dose, within three weeks for  Pfizer  and four weeks for Moderna.<br />Sticking to the dose schedule is essential, but supply is expanding and the production processes are proven. Some of the future supply can be given as second doses in those being vaccinated today. The very small possibility that a production snafu could delay second shots seems a reasonable risk to take.<br />Second, the distribution system needs improvement. Standing up vaccination sites and encouraging people to go get the shot is expensive and takes time. The best option may be to rely more on private industry. National pharmacy chains like CVS and  Walgreens  have an agreement with the federal government to provide vaccines to long-term care facilities. The government should expand this program to help vaccinate all Americans.</td>

      <td>They’re on taxpayer-funded salaries while working for the union.</td>
      <td>Should New Jersey’s taxpayers—strained under one of the heaviest tax burdens in the country—be paying public school teachers not to teach? The New Jersey Supreme Court will soon decide whether taxpayers should be required to pay for public employees to work solely for their unions, rather than the jobs they were hired to do.<br />Most assume that tax dollars go toward public goods—maintaining roads, ensuring safety and funding schools. But you don’t have to look hard to find taxpayer dollars going to private interests. Take “release time,” in which government workers are paid not to perform the jobs they were hired to do, and instead to work full-time for private labor unions—all while still receiving their full taxpayer-funded salaries and benefits.<br />Unfortunately, those entrusted with the care and education of children are often the worst abusers of release time. The New Jersey case involves release-time provisions in a collective-bargaining agreement between the Jersey City Board of Education and its teachers union. In that contract, the school board has agreed to pay the salaries of two full-time teachers to work exclusively for the union. While on release time, these teachers engage in political activities, negotiate higher wages and benefits, solicit new union members, attend union conferences and meetings, and file costly grievances against the district.<br />Fortunately, both state law and the New Jersey Constitution prohibit this arrangement. Under state law, the Legislature must expressly authorize a public expenditure like release time before a school board can include it in a contract. The Legislature never did that in this case, and the school board was not authorized to sign off on its own.<br />Like the constitutions of nearly every other state, New Jersey’s Constitution includes a “gift clause” prohibiting the government from giving public resources to private parties. So when the Jersey City School Board provides paid release time for two teachers to engage in private union activities, the Board is violating the state constitution’s gift clause.</td>

      <td>Independent regulators should analyze the costs and benefits of new rules, like executive agencies do.</td>
      <td>The last days of any administration will see “midnight” regulations and other last-ditch agency actions to try to cement the departing appointees’ priorities before the new guys take office. The incoming Biden team will surely do what every new administration does and cancel or overturn many of the executive orders and regulations the Trump administration has issued in recent weeks. But there’s one they should embrace: A Justice Department memorandum to the White House counsel that clears a path for improved decision-making by independent regulatory commissions.<br />The 31-page opinion, which was posted online last week, concludes that presidents “may direct independent agencies to comply with EO 12866”—an executive order issued by President Clinton in 1993 and reaffirmed by both Republican and Democratic presidents since. It requires agencies to perform a cost-benefit analysis on all economically significant regulations and to submit them for review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget before publication. According to President Obama, “the purposes of such review have been to ensure consistency with Presidential priorities, to coordinate regulatory policy, and to offer a dispassionate and analytical ‘second opinion’ on agency actions.”<br />Until last week, independent regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission were excluded from OIRA review and the cost-benefit requirement. These agencies are usually headed by bipartisan boards whose members serve staggered terms. The president nominates but can’t remove them except for good cause. Although Justice prepared a similar opinion in 1981, presidents have been reluctant to act on it in apparent deference to Congress and the Supreme Court’s acquiescence to the notion of “independence” from the executive.<br />The latest memo walks through the possible objections to the president’s authority over rulemaking by independent agencies and finds them lacking. By itself the opinion doesn’t change anything except to provide a basis for equal treatment of all agencies—whether executive branch or independent—that issue regulations with the force of law. But, it gives the president legal support for ordering those independent agencies to comply with the well-accepted requirements of the 1993 executive order. Substantial research shows that agencies not subject to EO 12866 requirements typically don’t undertake cost-benefit analysis and present less evidence than executive-branch agencies about whether a rule will achieve a desired goal.<br />Notably, the memo is dated October 2019 but it wasn’t posted until Wednesday. Executive branch officials often ask the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel to provide opinions regarding the legality of desired executive actions, but the office rarely shares those opinions beyond the requesting parties. There is no indication that President Trump will try to make any process changes based on the opinion (if he did, they would likely be rescinded by Mr. Biden on Inauguration Day). But the memo makes it clear that the option is available to improve the quality of regulations, which would be a valuable instrument for advancing Mr. Biden’s goals. This may be an option that the incoming administration would do well to accept.</td>

      <td>During the presidential campaign, Joe Biden blamed President Trump’s “incompetence and neglect” for the loss of U.S. sway in Latin America. The implication was that waning American influence in the region could be reversed by a president who paid more attention to the country’s neighbors.<br />Good luck with that. It is true that American values of sound money, low taxes, a light regulatory touch, open markets and the rule of law are no longer in vogue in much of the region. But beyond setting a better example, it’s hard to think of U.S. actions that would make a difference. Unless Mr. Biden plans to champion an aggressive new free-trade agenda for the hemisphere—something his party isn’t known to support—his options are limited.<br />The trouble with the Beltway’s talk about “engagement” is that it’s all too often a euphemism for pushing development aid out the door. Worse, any new round of handouts from the bidenistas would inevitably be tied to Democratic climate claptrap.<br />Nowhere does this approach have worse odds of success than in Argentina, where President Alberto Fernández is running the country into the ground in traditional Argentine fashion. No amount of foreign aid can fix a country where the productive economy has been reduced to a tool to serve the interests of an all-powerful political class.<br />Argentines were frustrated with the failure of center-right President Mauricio Macri to deliver on promises of growth-oriented reform from 2015-19. So they returned the populist left-wing peronists to power in December 2019. Some six months later Argentina defaulted for the ninth time in its history—the third time in 18 years.</td>

      <td>There’s something neurotic about our obsession with physical activity. A specialist in human locomotion offers some perspective.</td>
      <td>Daniel E. Lieberman is one of the world’s most outspoken experts on the effects of physical activity on the human body. So when I read the first pages of his new book, “Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved to Do Is Healthy and Rewarding,” I was surprised to find that he once hid in a closet to avoid gym class.<br />Doctors, fitness gurus and the media incessantly remind us that exercise leads to healthier and longer lives and thinner and more attractive bodies. We celebrate feats of sporting prowess and lavish attention upon superhero actors with near-pathologically cut torsos. So why, if this is all so good for us, do most of us have relationships with exercise that range from love-hate to hate-hate? Why do we rely on hectoring surveillance technologies like smartwatches to put us through our “required” daily paces?<br />The title of “Exercised” is a clue: There’s something neurotic, vexed, anxious about our obsession with physical activity. In the book, Mr. Lieberman faces down a dozen myths about physical fitness and health, devoting a chapter to each. His lens is evolution—he’s a Harvard paleoanthropologist with a specialty in human locomotion—and he studies the effects of energy-expending bodily movement in the laboratory and in varied groups of people around the world.<br />In one chapter, for example, Mr. Lieberman tackles the myth that sitting is bad for you. Disappointingly he finds that the myth is true, but not in the way most people assume. Contrary to conventional wisdom, slouching postures don’t lead to back pain, as evidenced both by reams of research on office workers and comparisons of sitting styles around the world. The real problem is that people don’t get up and move around enough. As scientists are beginning to understand, long-term inactivity and greater fat around our organs raise the risk of diseases of chronic inflammation, like arthritis and type 2 diabetes. Mr. Lieberman’s prescription? Don’t be inert for too long. Take a break. Get up. Or at least “squirm shamelessly.”<br />Until about two million years ago, every one of our ancestors lived by foraging for wild foods. Human physiology and anatomy adapted to these ancient lifestyles in ways that may not be optimal today. It’s not that we are worse off for this history—indeed, 21st-century Americans live longer, healthier lives than those of any previous era. But sometimes the tricks we once evolved to solve old problems trip us up today.</td>

The offer, which would have a substantial stock component, comes after an earlier, roughly $10 billion all-cash overture was rebuffed. The new bid comes with financial backing from the MGM’s largest shareholder,  IAC/InterActiveCorp . , the people said.<br />The exact details and value of the new bid couldn’t be learned, but it is above the £12.85 a share MGM had previously offered late last year, the people said. There is no guarantee Entain will be receptive to the new offer or that there will be a deal.<br />A combination could create one of the few large gaming companies in the world with a significant online and bricks-and-mortar presence. It would come on the heels of other recent consolidation in the industry.<br />Like its peers, MGM has been under pressure as the coronavirus pandemic kept its biggest moneymakers—casinos and hotels on the Las Vegas Strip—closed or operating at sharply reduced capacity for much of the year.</td>

      <td>Government aims to immunize majority of people by early spring, accelerating its vaccination drive after early hiccups led to wasted shots</td>
      <td>TEL AVIV—Israel has inoculated nearly half of its most at-risk citizens and more than 10% of the population in two weeks as authorities accelerate a Covid-19 vaccination drive after early hiccups had led to wasted shots.<br />The small country—with roughly nine million people, about the same as New York City—now aims to immunize the majority of its people by early spring. Israel’s vaccination campaign is relatively simple compared with the mass mobilizations needed by countries with many more people and a greater sweep of geography.<br />Israel started with vaccinating its health-care workers and those over the age of 60 on Dec. 20 after receiving early shipments of Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine. By Saturday, it had administered 12.59 doses per 100 of its people, according to the Oxford University-based research group Our World In Data. That rate of inoculation is nearly four times quicker than the second-fastest nation, the tiny Arab Gulf state of Bahrain.<br />“The health system is proving itself,” said Health Minister Yuli Edelstein in an interview Thursday with The Wall Street Journal. Israel boasts of a technologically advanced health-care system to which everyone in the country is registered by law.<br />The rollout offers insights into how authorities are attempting to maximize the campaign’s coverage for the most vulnerable while minimizing wastage of doses, which must be kept extraordinarily cold to keep them from going bad.</td>

      <td>Quantitative easing hoovers up bonds, leaving less collateral for eager borrowers.</td>
      <td>Dear Jerome Powell: End quantitative easing now. The Japanese tried QE in 2001, buying government debt, mortgage securities and even stocks. It didn’t work. The Federal Reserve has tried it four times since Lehman Brothers went belly up in 2008. QE doesn’t work and instead of keeping markets stable it creates instability.<br />The Fed supervises and regulates U.S. banks. But traditional banking (think Mr. Potter from “It’s a Wonderful Life”) represents only about 15% of all lending, maybe less. The rest is the mysterious-sounding shadow banking system based on securities lending and other credit products, including repurchase agreements—the repo market.<br />In repo, broker-dealers, hedge funds and banks construct short-term transactions. You put up collateral—Treasury bills or sometimes less-pristine instruments—with an agreement to buy them back the next day or week for slightly more, and invest the proceeds in the interim. Jeffrey Snider, head of research at Alhambra Investments, calls it a “reserve-less currency system.” This is how global supply chains are funded, to bring us cheap goods from  Walmart  or  Amazon .<br />Sometimes lenders repledge the collateral to other lenders and take out repo loans of their own. And the cycle goes on. It’s a little bit like hot potato, passing the collateral to the next guy. Known as rehypothecation, these transfers used to be done once or twice for each posted asset but are now sometimes done six to eight times, each time creating new money supply. Note: this is modern money creation—outside the purview of the Federal Reserve—and it’s huge.<br />When times are good, repos work fine: The agreements expire without problems and the collateral gets passed back down the chain smoothly. But eventually, iffy collateral sneaks into the system. That’s also fine, until markets hit an inevitable rough patch, like, say, March 2020. No one will take the junky stuff anymore, and everyone scrambles for good collateral. So there’s a mad dash, a brawl really, to buy Treasurys—like musical chairs with six to eight buyers eagerly eyeing one chair.</td>

      <td>Spending didn’t speed the last recovery, but Biden’s team is keen to keep the money flowing endlessly.</td>
      <td>When President Obama’s last Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, made the extraordinary claim that the Obama economic recovery failed because Washington “stopped [spending] too soon last time, and fiscal tightening after 2010 slowed the recovery” it sounded like another over-the-top argument for more stimulus. But with President-elect Joe Biden now making it clear that the recent $900 billion stimulus will “at best only be a down payment” and the now $3.3 trillion of total stimulus spending “is just the beginning,” it sounds like America is headed into a program of permanent stimulus.<br />Did the Obama recovery atrophy because spending tightened after 2010? Tightened compared with what? Between the start of the subprime mortgage crisis and the end of the recession in mid-2009, net new spending of $1.6 trillion was enacted. In 2009, federal spending as a share of gross domestic product surged by an unprecedented 4.2 percentage points to reach 24.4%, the highest level since World War II. Spending was 23.3% of GDP in 2010. In the entire postwar era through 2008, federal spending averaged 18.9% of GDP. For comparison, consider that the Korean War pushed federal spending only to 19.9%, even as defense spending made up 13.8% of the economy.<br />But what happened after 2010? At 23.4%, 2011 had the second-highest level of federal spending as a share of GDP since World War II—almost one-fourth higher than the postwar average before the Obama era. This is the year when, according to Mr. Lew, federal spending started to plummet. In 2012, federal spending was 22% of GDP, less than the stimulus years but still the fourth-highest level in the postwar period to that point. And 2012 was 3½ years after the recession ended.<br />When the recovery began some six months into the Obama administration, the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office both confidently predicted an economic boom, with real GDP growing an average of 3.6% from 2010-13. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve projected 3.4% growth for 2010-11. These predicted growth levels were well within the historic norm for postwar recoveries, and were buttressed by the largest stimulus package in U.S. history—larger than all previous postwar stimulus programs combined. Since this spending surge was financed entirely with debt, the stimulus impact should have been maximized as the Keynesian multiplier worked its miracles.<br />To further help the economy, the Fed initiated a massive monetary easing. The Fed purchased, or offset by purchasing other securities, more than 55% of all federal debt issued during 2010-13—far more than the 10% of government debt the Federal Reserve purchased during the entirety of World War II.</td>

But your editorial “Scapegoating Walmart” (Dec. 30) is correct:  Walmart ’s  pharmacies are not among them. Our government is scapegoating and suing the private sector, when the most important driver of the crisis was the federal government’s indiscriminate financing of the underlying opioid prescriptions. Government subsidies for pain management and other medical uses of opioids may be valuable, but people are dying from nonmedical uses that shouldn’t be publicly financed.<br />A 2019 report by the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers shows that the share of opioid pills paid for by the government went from 17% to 60% through the initial phase of the epidemic, from 2001 to 2010, when prescriptions dominated misuse, and didn’t stop there. Out-of-pocket prices for prescription opioids declined by 81% during this period. Without government subsidies, it would have cost between $26,000 and $53,000 a year to buy the pills to maintain an opioid addiction out-of-pocket.<br />The large prescription-based crisis would have been infeasible without government funding. Innovation into illegal opioids, which lowered the “price of a high” through fentanyl, was profitable only because of the large demand already generated by the prescription crisis. The government would make greater strides toward limiting the crisis by looking inward, not only outward, for its causes.<br />Prof. Tomas J. Philipson<br />University of Chicago</td>

      <td>Investment choices previously viewed as overpriced showed big gains in 2020. Can they prove doubters wrong again?</td>
      <td>It is easy to spot bubbles. Too easy: They seem to be almost everywhere, almost all the time. Worse still for those of us who try to spot excess, much of the stuff that was labeled frothy in recent years went on to make big money in 2020 for those who bought into it anyway.<br />The question for investors: Were the bubble calls just wrong? Or are we in a new era of wild speculation driven by cheap money that must inevitably come to an end?<br />I lean toward the latter. But the stunning performance of so many bubble stocks this past year shows that even if this turns out to be right eventually, there is plenty of scope to be horribly wrong in the meantime.<br />For one example, consider the bubble portfolio created in mid-2017 by Paul McNamara, an emerging-market fund manager at GAM. Featuring stocks and bonds labeled as bubbles by the financial  Twitter  community that year, it includes  Tesla ,   Netflix ,   Tencent ,  a bitcoin fund, Canadian apartments, London property and long-dated U.S., Japanese and Argentinian bonds. Only one—the Argentinian 100-year bond—is down since being selected, having lost almost all its value.<br />If you had spread $900 equally across the portfolio’s nine holdings at the end of June 2017, you would now have more than $2,950, more than double what you would have got from the S&P 500. Remember, this was buying the stuff that many thought was already wildly overvalued.</td>

      <td>For all its contradictions, president’s trade battle with China could smooth way for incoming administration to do better</td>
      <td>At first glance, the Trump administration appears to have left President-elect Joe Biden with a strong hand to play in trade negotiations with China. But bringing things to a successful resolution will be challenging on multiple fronts.<br />Despite the so-called “phase one” trade agreement struck in January 2020, tariffs between the two nations remain elevated. U.S. levies on Chinese goods have gone from an average level of 3.1% in January 2018, before tensions kicked into high gear, to 19.3% now, according to an analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. That is down only marginally from 21% before the deal. China’s average tariffs have risen, too, from 8.0% before the trade war to 20.3% now.<br />At the same time, China is all but certain to miss its commitments to purchase a series of U.S. goods. By November, for instance, it had purchased only around two-thirds of the volume of agricultural products it committed to for the entire year, according to PIIE.<br />In theory, this should give Mr. Biden a strong negotiating position. He has already said he wouldn’t immediately lift the tariffs, which should prove more punishing to China than the U.S., as its economy generally depends more on exports. Yet the Chinese economy is currently performing strongly because the country curbed the spread of the coronavirus earlier and thanks to a pandemic-triggered surge in global demand for its exports, from face masks to videogame consoles. Indeed, in November China’s trade surplus hit a new monthly high in dollar terms of $75 billion.<br />The most obvious way for the U.S. to add pressure would be to bring allies like Japan and Europe onto its side. Mr. Biden has pledged to do just this, but what exactly these allies are prepared and able to do remains unclear, said PIIE Senior Fellow Chad Bown. The EU, for instance, lacks the strong executive powers that Trump employed to set tariff levels, Mr. Bown says. The investment deal that China and the EU just agreed to in principle raises further doubts as to the Europeans’ willingness to confront Beijing.</td>

      <td>In the run-up to an initial public offering, startups typically hunker down in a quiet period, keeping their executives out of the media to avoid running afoul of regulatory requirements.<br />For numerous executives that took their startups public in 2020 by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, there was a different, perfectly legal approach: lengthy interviews with obscure YouTube channels frequented by individual traders, appearances on cable news, and projections that call for billions in revenue.<br />Publicity and forecasts of rapid growth have become routine aspects of the booming IPO alternative of going public through SPACs. The use of what are called blank-check companies, which go public with no assets and then merge with private companies, surged in 2020, raising a record $82.1 billion in 2020, up from $13.5 billion in 2019, according to Dealogic.<br />Startups that went public through SPACs, including many nascent companies with no revenue, have said they were attracted to the relative speed and certainty of the process, which can be completed months faster than some IPOs.<br />But as the tool gains favor, there are concerns about the regulatory differences between the two modes of going public. The prospect of wooing retail traders through media and inherently speculative projections brings heightened risk to stock-market investors, according to some venture capitalists and corporate-governance experts.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—A logjam in the global shipping industry is testing the resilience of China’s exporters, who have driven the country’s economic recovery by churning out goods to meet surging global demand during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />That demand in recent months has outpaced the capacity of a global shipping industry that has been slowed by pandemic safety measures. Chinese exporters have been paying sharply higher rates and struggling to find containers for their goods.<br />Chen Yang, who runs a textile trading unit at a state-owned enterprise in the southern city of Hefei, said the business, which mostly exports to the U.S., has weathered the pandemic and the China-U.S. trade war, but he expects to lose money this year in part because of a sharp rise in shipping costs.<br />A 40-foot container arriving at the port of Charleston, S.C., in December cost Mr. Yang around $7,500, up from $2,700 in April, he said. He also has to book space on the vessel at least 20 days in advance, more than double the usual time.<br /></td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) is poised to win her fourth term as House speaker on Sunday, but a narrower Democratic majority and uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic will make for little wiggle room.<br />Mrs. Pelosi has spent time in recent weeks shoring up support among Democrats to be able to carry a majority of those present and voting by name, as every vote will matter for the speakership as Congress convenes for its new session.<br />Democrats expect to have 222 seats to Republicans’ 211. One race in New York is still in dispute, and a seat in Louisiana will be vacant because Republican Rep.-elect Luke Letlow died on Tuesday from complications of Covid-19. Two other Republican lawmakers are expected to be absent because they have tested positive for Covid-19. It isn’t known if any Democrats will miss the vote.<br />“My opponent is Covid,” Mrs. Pelosi said on a call last week with Democrats discussing the speakership, according to a person on the call. To the public, she has asserted a confident position, saying last week she definitely expects to have a majority present and that she isn’t worried about getting re-elected.<br />Rather than assemble at once, House lawmakers will enter the chamber in groups on Sunday to enforce social distancing, which is expected to drag out a generally fast process into one that lasts several hours. First, a roll call will determine who is present. Then, lawmakers will select the speaker of the House. After that, members will take the oath of office in groups.</td>

      <td><br />Every family needs a home, and so do the many risks created by the 30-year mortgage that is standard in America.<br />Finding an investor to take each of those risks is a job of the Rube Goldberg contraption that is the U.S. housing-finance industry. Investors who don’t understand how it all fits together might one day find themselves scrambling for shelter.<br />Originators are probably the most familiar players to investors. They sit at the front of the process, and in many cases deal directly with borrowers. But for a mortgage with typical terms and size, they are usually not the player that ultimately owns the loan.<br />One major reason is the U.S. housing market’s unique system of taxpayer support, via the government-sponsored enterprises.  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  buy loans from originators, guarantee them and resell them to investors as agency mortgage securities. So in turn, many originators’ economics are ultimately driven by the volume of loans they produce and sell via Fannie or Freddie. This business model also avoids lending risk and requires less capital, making it appealing to investors.</td>

      <td>Headed into 2021, the U.S. faces a surge in coronavirus cases, new restrictions on business, cautious holiday shopping and slowing economic growth. Forecasters anticipate that the Labor Department’s December jobs report, due to be released Friday, will show the labor market closed the year on a weak footing.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect to see employers added 68,000 new jobs in December, down from 245,000 a month earlier. That would mark the slowest month of the labor market’s recovery since May.<br />As the Covid-19 pandemic drags into another year, however, economists see several reasons for optimism.<br />First, the recently enacted pandemic-relief legislative package will pump $900 billion into the economy in coming months.<br />Second, with much of the services sector hobbled by the pandemic, Americans have been saving an unusually high share of their income since spring, when the pandemic first prompted widespread restrictions on business activities. The U.S. personal saving rate was 12.9% in November, down from 33.7% in April but still well above the 7.5% rate a year earlier. Many households will be able to draw on those reserves to boost spending once coronavirus-related restrictions ease and vaccinations embolden people to venture out more, according to economists.</td>

      <td>Investors ended one of Wall Street’s wildest years on record by piling into everything from bitcoin to emerging markets, raising expectations that a powerful economic comeback will fuel even more gains.<br />The vast climb known as the “everything rally” accelerated late in the year, sending the S&P 500 to its 33rd record of 2020 last week. Following an early-year collapse, the broad U.S. equity gauge, global stocks and an index of raw materials each rose at least 35% from the end of March through the end of the year, only the third time in figures going back five decades that all of those investments have climbed so much in such a short time, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Both of the previous nine-month periods were in 2009 exiting the financial crisis.<br />The S&P 500 ended the year up 68% from its March lows, after losing more than one-third of its value in about a month. Government bond yields, which fall as prices rise, remain near all-time lows. Meanwhile, corporate bond yields also dropped after early-year turmoil. That means many bond investors ended the year with gains. And U.S. crude-oil prices are back near $50 a barrel after briefly dropping below $0 for the first time ever in April.<br />After the eye-popping rise during a global pandemic highlighted confidence that central banks and governments would prop up the world economy, many investors now expect the delivery of vaccines to buoy markets.<br />Gauges of sentiment from organizations including the American Association of Individual Investors show bearishness at multiyear lows. Meanwhile, tens of billions of dollars have recently plowed into exchange-traded and mutual funds that track stocks. Both of those trends have preceded past pullbacks, signaling excessive optimism to some cautious investors. Some are drawing parallels to the outsize gains late in 2017 and early 2018, before trade tensions and higher interest rates roiled markets.</td>

The move also highlights deepening divisions within the Republican Party over whether to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election as legitimate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and other Senate GOP leaders have congratulated Democrat President-elect Joe Biden and have urged their colleagues not to join in efforts to dispute the outcome.<br />The GOP senators who signed onto the effort are Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Braun of Indiana. It was also joined by Senators-elect Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.<br />By law, Congress must hold a joint session on Jan. 6 to ratify Mr. Biden’s 306-232 Electoral College win. Objections from some Republican senators and House members are expected to force debate and votes in both chambers of Congress. Majorities in both the House and Senate would have to agree for the challenge to be successful, an extremely unlikely prospect given that Democrats control the House.<br />In a statement released Saturday, the senators and senators-elect said the commission was needed because the 2020 presidential election was rife with “unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.”</td>

But investors and analysts say bookings will take years to rise back to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, the industry faces growing financial stress as property owners struggle to pay their mortgage bills, wages and other expenses.<br />Despite the record drop in bookings, many hotels have been able to stay open thanks to debt relief from banks and temporary government aid like the Paycheck Protection Program. Now some lenders are starting to lose patience, brokers and investors say, which could lead to an increase in foreclosures and distressed-property sales in the first half of 2021.<br />For hotel owners, “it’s all about survival,” said Greig Taylor, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners LLP.</td>

      <td>History suggests that the president-elect should insist on strong decision-making processes and deal firmly with staff misbehavior</td>
      <td>As President-elect Joe Biden builds his administration, he has drawn on his long experience in national politics, filling key positions with White House veterans and a sprinkling of newcomers. But the success of Mr. Biden’s administration will depend not just on who gets big jobs but on the thoughtful management of his team. The new president needs a staff and cabinet that are cohesive in debate and unified in action.<br />Administration infighting is inevitable, but it needn’t be paralyzing. Mr. Biden’s goal should be to manage conflict, not to eliminate it. History points to three primary levers at his disposal: recognizing and managing ideological conflict, maintaining a strong decision-making process and dealing firmly with staff and cabinet misbehavior.<br />The most frequent White House divisions are along ideological lines. President Ronald Reagan’s administration was plagued by clashes between moderates, led by White House chief of staff James A. Baker, and committed conservatives, led by counselor Edwin Meese. Mr. Baker, in particular, was a master leaker and infighter. Still, when Reagan chose Mr. Baker over Mr. Meese as chief of staff, he directed Mr. Baker to “make it right with Ed.” The two joined with deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver to form the “troika” that ran the early Reagan White House.<br />The lack of trust among the troika members wound up leaving them joined at the hip, reluctant to let each other meet privately with Reagan for fear that the others might use facetime with the president to their advantage. This need to stick together applied even after Reagan was shot in 1981. When the troika visited his hospital bed together, Reagan joked, “I should’ve known I wasn’t going to avoid a staff meeting.” Yet getting the perspective of the two main competing ideologies within the GOP helped Reagan to hold on to both sides.<br />President Bill Clinton also used his ideologically divided staff to his advantage. His team initially pulled his administration leftward with an unsuccessful health care initiative, a tax hike and a push to end the Pentagon’s ban on gay people serving in the military. The liberal drift contributed to the Democrats’ loss of both houses of Congress in 1994. Smarting, Mr. Clinton brought in a secret adviser—whom he code-named “Charlie”—to help moderate his administration. This adviser’s tactics and mysterious identity unnerved liberal White House staffers like George Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes, who found that progressive decisions made by day would shift to the right overnight.</td>

      <td>Urban guys are wearing technical outdoor gear from brands like Patagonia, And Wander and the North Face. They look like they could summit Everest—but they’re probably just running to Starbucks.</td>
      <td>GORPCORE, named for the trail-mix acronym that’s short for “good ol’ raisins and peanuts,” represents the convergence of outdoorsy gear and more quotidian men’s fashion. Think of the technical parkas and backpacks you’d wear while nibbling on nuts and dried fruit during a hike up a mountain. Now transfer that same gear to city streets, maybe paired with your prosaic sneakers.<br />The term “gorpcore”—coined by New York Magazine’s style site the Cut in 2017—has been bubbling up in men’s fashion for a few years. It emerged as an outdoor-specific offshoot of the 2010s’ normcore trend, which recontextualized humble, pragmatic clothes as lust-worthy fashion. The defining gorpian image might be a photo of taciturn singer Frank Ocean trekking to a Paris fashion show in 2019 wearing a fitted, clementine-orange jacket by 159-year-old Swiss mountaineering brand Mammut and a greenish beanie from 32-year-old North Vancouver outdoor brand Arc’teryx, with bluejeans and hiking boots. He looks as if he’s wandered off the Pacific Crest Trail and into the Tuileries.<br />That Mr. Ocean wore Arc’teryx and Mammut during fashion week and not, say, Prada is telling. Gorpcore is not about designer labels cynically co-opting the outdoor look, creating fragile mountaineering boots that look the part but would falter on the trail. It’s about a deep appreciation of genuine, all-weather brands stretching from Japan’s And Wander to California’s Patagonia.<br />Those two brands represent two distinct classes of gorpcore. And Wander, a Tokyo-based label founded in 2011, is one of several relatively new brands that sell high-design gear that could nevertheless withstand a toe-tingling winter squall. Think fleeces with reflective details and sturdy pocket-packed poly pants. Also in this category: fellow Japanese labels Snow Peak and F/CE, the Swedish cold-weather brand Houdini, and Gyakusou, a  Nike  offshoot focused on running garb.<br />The other class of gorpcore brands—including REI, Marmot and Patagonia—are long-established stalwarts traditionally valued for placing function over design. Freshly coveted by young gorpcore fanatics, this group includes seasoned global brands like Helly Hansen (Norway) and Goldwin (Japan), and cultier, trail-rooted labels such as Gramicci, Manastash and La Sportiva.</td>

      <td>Some Americans have a new outlook on remote working: They prefer it.<br />In June and July, a group of 1,388 people working from home were asked for their impressions of the experience by workplace consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics and video technology company Owl Labs.<br />The new arrangement, it turns out, suited many of them.<br />While roughly 27% said they would have considered such a setup to be ideal before the coronavirus pandemic started, 80% said they would like to continue working remotely for three days of the week or more once the pandemic is over. Many of these people said they would prefer remote work all five days of the workweek.<br />Another set of 10,000 employees surveyed by the Becker Friedman Institute for Economics at the University of Chicago say they felt the work-from-home situation was either just as productive or more so than the office. Some told the researchers that home was 30% more productive.</td>

      <td>NEW DELHI—India has authorized the Covid-19 vaccine from the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC, kick-starting global use of an inoculation that is expected to be embraced by developing countries given its lower price and ease of transport compared with other front-runners.<br />India’s information and broadcasting minister, Prakash Javadekar, said Saturday that the vaccine, which was developed in the U.K., has received permission for emergency usage.<br />“Last year began with corona. This year has begun with a vaccine,” he said at a news briefing in New Delhi on Saturday.<br />The U.K. authorized the vaccine earlier this week, and India is one of the first countries to follow suit.<br />The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could be a good fit for India and other developing countries thanks to its price, convenience and expected global reach. AstraZeneca has promised to make as many as three billion doses available in 2021—more than any other Covid-19 vaccine maker—and at a cheaper price.</td>
