      <td>Billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a giant in the casino-resort industry and one of the largest donors to the Republican Party, has died at the age of 87.<br />As a young man, Mr. Adelson seemed to lack focus. The son of an immigrant Jewish cabdriver, he flitted from one business to another, dabbling in mortgage brokerage, investment advice, venture capital, real estate, chartered tours and sales of De-Ice-It spray for windshields.<br />In his mid-30s, Mr. Adelson began finding his way as an entrepreneur who would become one of the world’s richest men, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $35.9 billion. He made himself into a giant in the casino industry with his lucrative resorts, one of the largest donors to the Republican Party, a leading backer of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a newspaper publisher in Nevada and Israel.<br />Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced the death of its chairman and chief executive in a statement Tuesday, less than a week after the company said he was taking a medical leave for cancer treatment. In March 2019, the company said Mr. Adelson had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.<br />His unlikely rise from obscurity began when he launched a trade publication for data-communications firms in the 1970s. Mr. Adelson noticed that other publishers sponsored trade shows. So, in 1979, near the beginning of the personal-computer boom, he launched Computer Dealers Exposition, or Comdex, which became a hugely successful trade exhibit held in Las Vegas and other cities. In 1988, needing space for his own exhibition center in Las Vegas to accommodate growing crowds, he bought the Sands hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip for $110 million, opening up a new line of business.</td>

      <td>If golf courses and resorts struggle to attract and keep members, it would weigh on the overall Trump Organization</td>
      <td>The storming of the Capitol last week by a pro-Trump mob will ratchet up the pressure on President Trump’s family business at a moment when some of his most lucrative assets were already suffering from the pandemic and facing looming debt payments.<br />One of the Trump Organization’s most loyal partners, German lender  Deutsche Bank AG , is moving to distance itself from the president’s businesses and is unlikely to lend it more money, says a person familiar with the matter. The bank has lent the Trump Organization more than $300 million that will mature in 2023 and 2024, forcing the company to refinance the debt or pay it off by potentially selling assets.<br />The other risk to the Trump Organization is that some customers stop patronizing its businesses, in particular its hotels and golf courses. The company has tried to sell its Washington, D.C., hotel, but the pandemic made buyers wary. The hotel was popular with supporters of Mr. Trump and with organizations trying to seek favor from the president. Business had already been expected to decline there once Mr. Trump leaves office.<br />The Trump Organization’s golf courses and resorts are particularly important, accounting for nearly half of the company’s annual revenue. The courses are closely associated with the president and have used his name to attract customers in a weak market for golf. If the courses struggle to attract and keep members, it would weigh on the Trump Organization overall.<br />On Sunday, PGA of America said it was terminating an agreement to hold the 2022 PGA Championship at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, citing risk to its brand of being affiliated with Mr. Trump. The Trump Organization said that the PGA’s decision was a “breach of a binding contract.”</td>

Former Attorney General William Barr and other federal law-enforcement officials have said there was no evidence of fraud in Michigan or elsewhere sufficient to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss to President-elect Joe Biden.<br />Lawyers for the city of Detroit last week asked a federal judge in Michigan’s Eastern District to reprimand the lawyers who brought one of the lawsuits alleging fraud—including Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood, who worked with the Trump campaign—and to refer them for disbarment and impose financial penalties.<br />“The extent of the factual and legal errors in this complaint would warrant sanctions under any circumstances, but here the court’s processes are being perverted to undermine our democracy and to upset the peaceful transfer of power,” Detroit’s lawyer, David Fink, wrote to U.S. District Judge Linda V. Parker.<br />The lawsuit was filed on behalf of several Michigan voters, claiming that Michigan election officials used election software designed by foreign dictators to manipulate the vote, along with other unproven illegal conduct at the polls.</td>

While some of these companies authorized buying back their own shares even before the coronavirus pandemic, they are betting that with a vaccine rollout under way, travel, office work and mall shopping will bounce back after a terrible year for major property types.<br />Brookfield Asset Management Inc.  took this strategy one step further last week, when it offered to buy the nearly 40% stake in  Brookfield Property Partners  LP it doesn’t already own for $5.9 billion. Brookfield Property, which BAM spun off about eight years ago, is one of the world’s largest real-estate investors and owns the giant office and retail complexes Brookfield Place in New York and London’s Canary Wharf.<br />The stock market “doesn’t properly value or appreciate the quality of the assets that we own,” Brian Kingston, managing partner of BAM’s real-estate group, said last week.<br />Shares of public mall and office companies last week were trading at average discounts of 20% and 32%, respectively, to the net asset value of their underlying property, according to real-estate analytics firm Green Street.</td>

Lyft officials shared their analysis of public data with the Biden team on the millions of at-risk people who lack health-care transportation benefits or have limited public transportation due to coronavirus, she said.<br />Separately, Uber said Tuesday it is joining with vaccine maker  Moderna Inc.  to provide users with vaccine-safety information via the ride-sharing app. The companies said they aim to work with public-health agencies to help those eligible for doses to schedule rides and receive reminder notifications.<br />The pandemic has weighed on ride-sharing companies as the spreading virus shut down restaurants and curbed social gatherings and travel. Ferrying people to vaccine sites could boost their business in the near term and may help kick-start a rollout that has gone more slowly than federal officials planned.<br />Both major ride-sharing companies have talked to public-health officials across the country about helping with appointment transport, according to people familiar with those discussions, and have publicly offered millions of free rides to and from vaccine-administration sites. Ms. Callahan said state and municipal officials from heavily populated areas have been asking Lyft for free rides “because they do not have the funds.”</td>

      <td>The implications for investors of unified government and a boost in stimulus will be mixed but initially good for stock prices</td>
      <td>After last week’s special Senate elections in Georgia, Democrats are about to attain unified—though narrow—control of Washington. With that, the economy will likely be at the receiving end of significantly more federal support than most on Wall Street had expected.<br />It is a shift that could change the contours of the U.S. economy in the year ahead, accelerating the rebound that will likely come as more Americans are vaccinated against Covid-19 and allowing the Federal Reserve to begin lifting its foot off the accelerator sooner. It also could bring about higher taxes, more regulation and stepped-up deficit worries, but those concerns might not be front and center for some time.<br />One of Congress’s first orders of business following President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20 will likely be putting forward another relief package in response to the Covid-19 crisis. Before Georgia’s special elections, when many thought at least one Republican candidate would prevail, leaving the Senate under GOP control, economists and political analysts didn’t expect much in the way of additional aid. That has changed.<br />Now, another round of relief is widely expected, with the money likely going toward some combination of another round of household checks, an extension of enhanced unemployment benefits that are set to expire mid-March, small-business support and, perhaps, more state and local aid. Later there would be a push for spending aimed at infrastructure projects and clean-energy programs.<br />The scope for spending could be more limited than in the blue-wave scenarios Wall Streeters contemplated ahead of November’s election that foresaw Democrats gaining, rather than losing, seats in the House and capturing a bigger lead in the Senate. Moderate Democratic representatives and senators will hold more sway, and they will balk if they believe the price tag has become too high. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a centrist Democrat, already has indicated he would like additional household relief efforts to be targeted at people in need, as opposed to another round of payments that go to most Americans.</td>

      <td>Oil is extending a steady recovery into 2021, aided by fresh signals that the world’s biggest producers won’t turn on the spigots and flood the market.<br />U.S. crude futures recently rose above $50 a barrel for the first time since last February, the latest milestone in a rebound powered by an uptick in travel and economic activity following the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Output cuts by large suppliers from Saudi Arabia to U.S. companies are turbocharging the advance, giving traders confidence that demand will exceed supply.<br />Prices have hit new peaks since Saudi Arabia said last week it would unilaterally cut output in February as part of an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia. The supply curbs instilled faith that the cartel will remain flexible with output even if the pandemic worsens and hurts demand.<br />U.S. shale producers are also indicating that they are in no rush to increase supply and instead plan to pay off debt and return cash to shareholders. Taken together, the commitments should help the energy industry’s recovery and highlight a recognition among producers that the economic toll caused by the pandemic is far from over, investors and industry executives say. That means there is no need for suppliers to spend on additional output.<br />“I don’t think the world really needs the oil at this point in time, so there’s not a big reason to grow,” said Richard Dealy, president and chief operating officer of Texas oil company Pioneer Natural Resources Co. Despite the recent rise in oil prices, Pioneer still plans to cap oil-production growth at zero to 5% in 2021.</td>

Divers and search crew, who grappled with sharp debris and low underwater visibility, managed to recover the plane’s flight-data recorder on Tuesday, an important early step in uncovering why SJ182 crashed.<br />The plane had stopped operating in late March, weeks after Indonesia announced its first Covid-19 case, the transportation ministry said. The aircraft began flying again on Dec. 19, after clearing an inspection by the ministry’s Air Transportation Directorate General, it said.<br />Its first flight after the long hiatus didn’t carry passengers and was noncommercial, the ministry said. The plane began flying with passengers on Dec. 22, 2½ weeks before the crash.

      <td>Mac sales boom in quarter that included in-house chip launch, according to IDC and Gartner</td>
      <td>As it turns out, Apple picked a perfect time to mess with the Mac.<br />The consumer-electronics giant launched a new line of the iconic computers with its first in-house processor in mid-November. The company felt strongly enough about the machines to remove the older models using Intel’s chips from its online store. It was no small gamble: Intel’s chips have powered Mac computers since 2006, while Apple’s new in-house processors use the entirely different Arm-based chip architecture that had so far proved unpopular in PC devices.<br />Buyers appeared to snap them up in what is an overall sweet spot for PC sales. According to sales data from market-research firms  Gartner  and IDC released Monday, Mac unit sales hit a record in the fourth quarter, which is also Apple’s fiscal first quarter. IDC estimates sales surged 49% year over year to about 7.3 million units, while Gartner estimates they jumped 31% to about 6.9 million units. Apple stopped disclosing unit sales of its devices at the end of its 2018 fiscal year; the most Mac sales it ever reported before that was 5.7 million units in the quarter ending in September 2015.<br />The pandemic made Apple’s timing especially fortuitous. Workers and students confined to their homes have been buying up PCs in droves across the board. Both IDC and Gartner reported another strong sales jump in the fourth quarter, with IDC estimating a 26% year-over-year increase to 91.6 million units. The three largest PC suppliers—Lenovo, HP and Dell—each saw double-digit gains in the period. Chromebooks have continued to play a strong role thanks to a boom in remote schooling; Gartner estimates Chromebook sales surged 200% year over year to about 11.7 million units in the quarter.<br />The boom from the pandemic is no doubt temporary for most of the mature PC market. Apple’s advantage here is that it still has Macs in its lineup awaiting the upgrade to its in-house processor. Those will include its desktop and pro-level machines, which are expected to be moved to Apple chips over the next year or two. That gives the Mac a good chance to outlive the current PC fever.</td>

      <td>Shot developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University could be adopted across the EU by the end of January</td>
      <td>LONDON— AstraZeneca  PLC has applied for emergency-use authorization in Europe of the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with the University of Oxford, a step toward the rollout of more shots across the region as infections and hospitalizations rise.<br />The European Union’s drug regulator said Tuesday it could authorize the vaccine as soon as Jan. 29 after completing a review of clinical-trial data. The European Medicines Agency’s key scientific committee will meet that day after additional analysis of the trial results and safety and manufacturing data. Any recommendation to green light the vaccine would likely be formalized by the European Commission within a day or two.<br />That timeline eventually could add 400 million doses to Europe’s vaccine arsenal as the region battles a deadly winter surge of the virus, exacerbated by the spread of a variant first discovered in the U.K. The EU has preordered 300 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, with an option for 100 million more.<br />Last week, Europe cleared a vaccine developed by  Moderna Inc.  for emergency use, giving the region a second Covid-19 shot. The bloc is struggling to distribute the doses it has, after authorizing a vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and German partner  BioNTech SE  in December.<br />Distribution across 27 member states has been hurt by logistical bottlenecks and challenges with ultracold storage requirements that complicate widespread distribution. Some governments in Europe early on were expecting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to be first to market, leaving them unprepared for the freezer logistics of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, resulting in slow, uneven rollouts.</td>

      <td>South Korean giant recently forecast 25% jump in quarterly operating profit, aided by resurgent phone sales</td>
      <td>SEOUL—Huawei Technologies Co.’s sanctions-induced smartphone slump has rivals seeing opportunity in a market where switching brands is rare.<br />With U.S. restrictions curbing its access to key parts, Huawei has suffered a plunge in sales in recent months, most strongly benefiting South Korea’s  Samsung  Electronics Co. and other Chinese makers.<br />Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker, will be moving roughly a month ahead of its usual timetable when it launches its new flagship Galaxy S21 on Thursday—capitalizing on No. 2 maker Huawei’s weakness, industry analysts say. Samsung recently forecast a 25% jump in quarterly operating profit, aided by a resurgence in phone sales.<br />Not long ago, Huawei seemed on track to meet its oft-touted goal of permanently unseating Samsung. But in the three months ended Sept. 30, its global market share shrank by nearly a quarter from a year earlier to 15% while Samsung’s grew to 23%, according to market researcher Canalys Inc. Lower-cost Chinese operators like  Xiaomi Corp.  and Vivo Electronics Corp. also gained.<br />Those trends persisted during the final months of 2020, industry analysts say, with estimates for a slight retraction in shipments. The overall smartphone market has been struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic’s blows last spring and summer. Analysts say they expect consumer demand to return to pre-pandemic levels this year.</td>

While the case for economic recovery appears sound and many fund managers expect the market advance to continue, skeptics say stocks remain vulnerable to fallout from the pandemic, including still-high unemployment and questions about the pace of the vaccine rollout.

      <td>Europe’s lockdown-support programs risk creating the kind of festering bad-debt problems that damaged its economy after the financial crisis</td>
      <td>A decade ago, Europe’s recovery from the global financial crisis was held back by the lingering bad-debt problems of its banks. History risks repeating itself.<br />The region’s generous lockdown-support programs and patchwork of insolvency laws could create so-called zombie firms—inefficient companies kept alive by cheap debt. Last month, the European Central Bank said this remains a risk.<br />Meanwhile, bank shares have been buoyed by optimism that Covid-19 vaccines will revive the economy and shareholder payouts will resume. The Stoxx Europe 600 banks index is up nearly 30% in the past three months, triple the main index performance and roughly on a par with the U.S. bank benchmark.<br />Following both the global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis, nonviable companies in Europe were kept alive by politicians worried about job losses and lenders hesitant to acknowledge bad debts. The zombies lowered markups, net investment and productivity in their markets as well as inflation in the wider economy, according to a recent report from the Federal Bank of New York—problems that have come back to bite their lenders too.<br />Pandemic support programs, such as loans and bankruptcy moratoria, aspire to give businesses the time needed to secure their finances and pivot operations to better serve pandemic and post-pandemic customers. Sometimes, though, the support simply provides cheap funds that help unsustainable companies limp on. It is very hard for policy makers to get the timing right on these programs: Rolling back too early could hurt viable businesses, but too late can create zombies.</td>

The new borrowing drove the total amount of outstanding muni debt above $3.9 trillion for the first time since 2013, according to the Federal Reserve data from the third quarter.<br />The muni issuance boom is unlikely to abate as cash-strapped local governments struggle to make up for ongoing Covid-19-related shortfalls and pay back old debts. Before the pandemic, many city and state governments had already been operating on tight budgets.<br />Despite the increase in availability of muni bonds, investor demand remains strong. Central bank rate cuts have left investors clamoring for yield. Muni bond investments produced steady returns last year in a low-interest rate environment.<br />“There’s no yield anywhere so munis are still attractive on a relative basis,” said Jon Barasch, director of municipal evaluations at financial analytics company ICE Data Services.</td>

The new perimeter will add another layer to the secure areas typically in place for inaugural ceremonies at the Capitol.<br />Those talks came as federal officials decided to begin coordinating security steps sooner than they had planned and the National Guard announced it would bolster its presence in Washington ahead of the inauguration.</td>

Instead, it expanded to 75, largely because demand grew much faster than expected, said Landing Chief Executive Bill Smith.<br />“Covid has taken a decade of change that I was thinking was going to happen between now and 2030 and kind of compressed it into a year,” he said.</td>

However, U.S. intelligence warned that Russia was engaged in trying to undermine Mr. Biden’s candidacy.<br />The Treasury said Monday that Mr. Derkach has been an active Russian agent for over a decade with close connections to the Kremlin’s intelligence services.

That was before a mob of the president’s supporters laid siege to the Capitol, leaving five people dead.<br />“Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honor represents and admiration for prior recipients,” Belichick said in a statement. “Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award.”<br />News of the offer to Belichick only emerged Sunday, prompting questions over whether the most accomplished coach in football history would stand by his friend amid the controversy.<br />Although Belichick’s statement did not mention Trump by name, the decision amounts to a sharp rebuke of a president who has faced calls from Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, to be removed from office. His decision comes just days after Trump awarded the medal to Gary Player and Annika Sorenstam, two of the best golfers of all time.

The Department hasn’t had a leader confirmed by the Senate since Kirstjen Nielsen submitted her resignation in April 2019.<br />Mr. Wolf ultimately made the decision to leave, an aide said, because of an arcane law forbidding acting officials to continue to serve in their posts if the White House withdraws their Senate nomination.<br />Mr. Wolf was nominated to serve as Homeland Security secretary in August, but the White House withdrew his nomination last Wednesday in a move it hasn’t since explained. The aide pointed out that Mr. Wolf on Thursday became the first cabinet-level official to call on Mr. Trump by name to condemn the attack on the Capitol building the day earlier.</td>

      <td>He’d help the country and his Presidency by calling off the House.</td>
      <td>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is barreling ahead on a vote to impeach President Trump this week—days before a new President takes office, and with the outcome and timing of a Senate trial uncertain. This is a moment for Joe Biden to establish his leadership by calling off the House impeachers in service of his vow that this is a “time to heal.”<br />We explained Friday why Mr. Trump’s actions last Wednesday were impeachable offenses, and that the best outcome would be his resignation. It appears he won’t resign. But that doesn’t mean impeachment now is wise or good for the country if the goal is get past the Trump era. It may do more harm by letting Mr. Trump play the victim than good by stigmatizing behavior that most Americans already find unacceptable.<br />The first obstacle is timing. In eight days Mr. Trump will be gone from the White House. A House vote this week means no fact-finding or time for a presidential defense. The Senate isn’t scheduled to reconvene until Jan. 19, the day before Mr. Biden is inaugurated. Even if Senators convene earlier, Republicans aren’t likely to hold a trial without giving Mr. Trump a chance to mount a defense, as other impeached officials have been able to do.<br />That leaves a trial to take place when Mr. Trump is no longer President. Views differ on whether the Constitution allows impeachment after a President leaves office, though this would be a first. Alan Dershowitz, the law professor and one of Mr. Trump’s impeachment lawyers in 2019, made a compelling case Sunday that this constitutional point would be part of Mr. Trump’s defense.<br />This assumes Democrats even want a Senate trial and the risk of a potential acquittal. Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat, said Sunday the House might vote to impeach but then wait weeks or months before sending an article to the Senate.</td>

      <td>He’s still short of the votes needed for another term as House speaker.</td>
      <td>The man most responsible for the dreadful condition of Illinois politics and the state’s finance has finally suffered a tentative defeat. On Monday Mike Madigan, the speaker of the Illinois House for all but two years since 1983, said he will suspend his attempt to seek the 60 votes he needs for another term as the boss.<br />Mr. Madigan said he will wait and see if anyone else can get enough votes after he won only 51 in a Democratic caucus vote on Sunday. State Rep. Ann Williams finished second with 18 votes and another competitor had three. So Mr. Madigan still may keep the job in the end if he can threaten or buy off enough of the dissenters.<br />It’s amazing that he still received 51 votes. Mr. Madigan’s associates have been indicted in a corruption probe in which Commonwealth Edison agreed to pay a $200 million fine for a scheme to curry favor with the speaker. He says he did nothing wrong. He is also chair of the state Democratic Party, which he can use to make or break legislative careers.<br />Since he’s been speaker, the once great Prairie State has seen its credit rating fall from one of the highest to the worst in the country. Its citizens are fleeing for better-run neighbors and low-tax Florida. But even at 78 years old, he has managed to hold on to power like the Chicago ward boss he once was. Mr. Madigan’s political demise won’t save Illinois by itself, but it would be a start.</td>

Rumble said Google’s behavior cost it significant numbers of viewers and advertising dollars.<br />The lawsuit also argues that Google’s deals to pre-install a YouTube app on mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system have unfairly deprived Rumble of viewers.<br />“Google, through its search engine, was able to wrongfully divert massive traffic to YouTube, depriving Rumble of the additional traffic, users, uploads, brand awareness and revenue it would have otherwise received,” the lawsuit states.<br />“We will defend ourselves against these baseless claims,” a Google spokeswoman said.</td>

      <td>The Justices can rein in an FTC that increasingly exceeds its authority.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration is expected to unleash regulators on business. So it’s good timing that the Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear a case (AMG Capital v. FTC) challenging the Federal Trade Commission’s abuse of its regulatory power.<br />Congress has empowered the FTC to prevent, prohibit and punish “unfair or deceptive” business practices. The Federal Trade Commission Act doesn’t define these terms, so the FTC is supposed to know them when it sees them. The agency increasingly sees them wherever it looks.<br />Consider the case of Scott Tucker, who managed companies that provided short-term loans over the internet that automatically renewed—a common feature of financial products. In 2002 the FTC began investigating Mr. Tucker. Ten years later, with no prior notice of legal violation, the FTC sued him and his businesses.<br />The agency says he engaged in unfair and deceptive practices by not disclosing loan terms with sufficient clarity. The FTC asked the district court to enjoin him and his associates from making these loans and fork over $27 million in restitution, which would go to the U.S. Treasury if “direct redress” to consumers was “impracticable.”<br />Mr. Tucker says this exceeded the FTC’s legal authority, and he has a strong case. In 1973 Congress stipulated that the FTC can seek injunctions for practices that are unfair or deceptive. Congress added in 1975 that the FTC can seek monetary relief, but only when a business has violated a cease-and-desist order or rule-making that expressly prohibits a practice. The FTC must also prove in court that a “reasonable man would have known under the circumstances” that the conduct at issue “was dishonest or fraudulent.”</td>

Chief Executive Stephen Squeri in a memo sent to employees Monday, announcing the company’s decision to suspend PAC donations to more than 100 congressional Republicans who voted to challenge the election results.<br />Dallas-based  AT&T ,  one of the biggest corporate lobbyists, said its federal PAC’s board “decided to suspend contributions to members of Congress who voted to object to the certification of Electoral College votes last week.” It wasn’t immediately clear how long the suspension will last.</td>

      <td>Xavier Becerra’s policy on nonprofits is in the dock.</td>
      <td>Xavier Becerra has been nominated to run the Department of Health and Human Services, but his current California office is going to the Supreme Court. The Justices agreed on Friday to hear a pair of lawsuits opposing California’s blanket policy that charities must turn over the names and addresses of their major donors.<br />That information is given to the IRS on a Schedule B form, but it’s sensitive and legally protected from federal disclosure. “No California law or regulation expressly requires charities to file their Schedule Bs with the California Attorney General in renewing their annual registrations,” says the petitioner in Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Becerra. The state began demanding the information in 2010.<br />California pledged to keep it confidential. But in the course of litigating this case, the foundation says that it “discovered 1,778 Schedule Bs that the Attorney General’s Registry had publicly posted online.” One disclosed was “a complete Schedule B for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California,” including “the names and addresses of hundreds of donors.” Whoops.<br />Mr. Becerra and state officials say Schedule Bs are required, and there’s a simple reason they weren’t demanded before 2010: “staffing shortages.” He adds that the donor information is used to detect and investigate fraud, as well as abuse of charitable status. But how is this narrowly tailored as a potential restriction on First Amendment rights?<br />The foundation says, “California lacks any satisfying explanation for why it is not content to send targeted, individualized requests for such information to the handful of charities it actually investigates.” Privacy is vital to freedom of association, as the Supreme Court recognized in 1958, when it held that the state of Alabama could not demand the NAACP’s membership lists.</td>

Research firm  Gartner  said PC shipments reached 275 million units in 2020, up 4.8% on the year. Similarly, Canalys pegged the increase at 11% to 297 million units, the highest annual growth since 2010 and the highest shipment volume since 2014.<br />Much of the difference in the tallies from the data providers comes from how each company defines PCs. Hardware makers in recent years have increasingly blurred the lines between personal computers and devices such as tablets.<br />The blockbuster figures come out just as CES, the world’s largest tech show, gets under way—virtually this year because of the pandemic. The annual gathering is often the staging ground for PC makers to unveil their latest models, which could help drive future sales.</td>

      <td>Its restoration would advance American interests abroad.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration is expected to shift U.S. foreign policy in ways that could aid the cause I have advocated for many years: rights and freedoms for people in Turkey, my home country. As a modern, prosperous Muslim nation, Turkey was often touted to Middle Eastern autocracies as a role model and a better way. But in only a decade it has become one of them—another autocracy.<br />My call for the U.S. to nudge Turkey in the right direction has brought me death threats, international arrest warrants, kidnapping attempts, and harassment even on U.S. soil. But no matter what happens to me and my family, you can’t put a price tag on freedom.<br />Why should the U.S. help the Turkish people restore their democracy? Not only to do good in the world. It should and can be justified by America’s national interest.<br />A democratic Turkey is more likely to align with the U.S. abroad. Today Ankara looks to Qatar for a financial lifeline and Russia for security. Turkey’s politics scare away investors and make it difficult for the U.S. to sell arms. But half of Turkey’s trade is with Europe, and its credit-driven economy depends on Western investment. The U.S. and NATO have for decades provided Turkey a security umbrella. Alignment with the West makes sense, but Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s regime stands in its way.<br />Meantime, Turkey’s economy teeters, kept upright by the Erdogan government at the expense of regional stability. In exchange for investments from Qatar, Turkey has been doing the Gulf state’s bidding in Libya and Syria and confronting Qatari rivals and U.S. allies, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.</td>

The result is more verbal combat and less deliberative thought—all with language we often wouldn’t use while looking someone in the eye. I have been guilty of this recently, and I haven’t always been proud of my language.<br />It reduces the value of communication to statements graded by “likes” or being “ratioed,” and other mechanisms that don’t reflect real human response or quality of thought.</td>

      <td>From “The Coming Plague,” an April 10, 2007, Journal op-ed by Manhattan Institute fellow Peter Huber, who died Jan. 8 at 68:<br /><br />Germs no longer need to be smarter than our scientists, just faster than our lawyers. Public authorities are ponderous, rigid and slow; the new germs are nimble, flexible and fast. Drug regulators are paralyzed by the knowledge that error is politically lethal; the new germs make genetic error—constant mutation—the key to their survival. Germs use pigs, bacteria and each other as genetic mixing bowls. They discover ways (as one strain of HIV has apparently now done) to use our drugs as food. And they celebrate our Constitution. People as negligent with pills as they are with germs have already helped spawn drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis, by taking enough medicine to kill weaker strains, while leaving hardy mutants alive to take over the business. . . .<br />Pentagon-scale government has trouble enough dealing with car bombers; government contractors will never be agile enough to keep up with germs. What we need is a robust, flexible, innovative, diverse and fragmented portfolio of drug companies, sinking a lot of new capital into highly speculative ventures, almost all of which will lose money, with just one or two ending up waved through by regulators, eagerly paid for by insurers, vindicated every time by judges and juries, lauded in the mass media, and so spectacularly profitable for investors that they crowd in to fund more.<br />It is hard to see how we will get there without a revival of our germ-fearing culture, and it may well take a horrible germ to revive it. How horrible? What might it look like?</td>

      <td>She is notably less moderate (or, if you’d prefer, more progressive) than Joe Biden—a source of strength to voters on the left.</td>
      <td>One consequence of the events of Jan. 6—in which Mike Pence could be said to have protected the Constitution from his own president—should be that American voters will come to pay as fierce attention to the mettle of their prospective vice presidents as they do to that of their presidential candidates.<br />In truth, scrutiny of a kind more exacting than normal has already fallen upon Kamala Harris: the vice president-elect was the running mate of a man who will next week become the oldest president in America’s history. So it isn’t necessarily ill-mannered to ask what sort of successor Ms. Harris would make were her genial but timeworn boss to fail to finish his first term.<br />It is safe to say, after reading “Kamala’s Way,” that Americans who range rightward from the political center will be mighty relieved if Mr. Biden were to enjoy the best of health over the next four years. As Dan Morain makes plain in this detailed and dutiful biography, Ms. Harris is notably less moderate (or, if you’d prefer, more progressive) than Mr. Biden—and so, naturally, a source of strength to voters on the left.<br />Mr. Morain, a veteran newspaperman, covered California’s politics for nearly three decades at the Los Angeles Times and then, for several years, at the Sacramento Bee. “Kamala’s Way” is a story told in a steadfast (and sometimes plodding) chronological sequence. It starts at the time Ms. Harris’s Indian mother and Jamaican father met in Berkeley, Calif., in 1962 and runs through to October 2020, when the book ends, poised a hair’s breadth away from an election that would make Ms. Harris the first woman/African-American/South Asian vice president of the United States.<br />Mr. Morain reveals that neither Ms. Harris nor her family would grant interviews or “provide help in the reporting” of his book, since he wrote it in the middle of the election campaign. But a number of sources with “firsthand knowledge” did speak to him. And he has mined material from Ms. Harris’s own autobiography, “The Truths We Hold,” which was published in January 2019 to coincide with the launch of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.</td>

He squandered a good chunk of it in the Georgia runoffs, when he made them all about himself instead of about keeping Republican control over the Senate. But it was finished off by the mob of his own supporters who stormed the Capitol this past Wednesday and inflicted more lasting damage on their man than anything his enemies ever managed.<br />At the moment, Washington is consumed with just how humiliating Mr. Trump’s exit will be—with a second impeachment, with the 25th Amendment invoked, with his resignation. There’s even talk of holding a Senate trial when he’s no longer president.<br />But for anyone who cares about unity and healing, the president’s fate is no longer the primary concern. More important is the future for the half of America that supported him. Because there is an effort to lump the 74 million Americans who voted for Mr. Trump with those who rampaged through the Capitol—thus rendering them unfit for polite society going forward.<br />There’s no denying the reality of the thugs. But let me tell you about the people I know who attended that rally. To a person, they are decent, ordinary Americans who didn’t enter the Capitol and wouldn’t dream of disobeying a police officer.<br />Some (but not all) believe the election was stolen. They’re mistaken, but that doesn’t make them white supremacists, domestic terrorists, religious extremists or  any of the many noxious names they’ve been called. Those I know personally are now terrified that they will be doxed—meaning vengeful leftists will make their personal information public—and perhaps fired from their jobs if it gets out they were in Washington for the rally.</td>

      <td>British band Shame’s evocative lyrics and propulsive beats stand out in London’s crowded, post-punk scene.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />Rock music may be on the wane commercially, but England continues to produce young and aggressive young bands who channel the sound and attitude from the glory days of post-punk. In the past few years, South London has been fertile ground for such groups, including Black MIDI, Fat White Family and the five-piece outfit Shame. The last of these formed in 2014 when its members were teenagers and released its debut album, “Songs of Praise,” in 2018. Though the record wasn’t a huge seller, Shame and its surrounding scene generated a fair amount of hype in the British press. The group’s influences are right there on the surface—the forceful grooves of Gang of Four, the bitter, half-spoken vocal rants of the Fall, the cathartic choruses of the Clash—but Shame’s perspective is contemporary, befitting the youth of its members (none has reached 25). The band’s second album, “Drunk Tank Pink” (Dead Oceans), out Friday, intensifies and distills its sound and is its strongest work to date.<br />“Drunk Tank Pink” was completed at least six months ago and was written before the pandemic, but you can’t blame a group like this for trying to hold a record until concerts are possible. Shame has a reputation as a great live band, due in no small part to its rhythm section.

      <td>Australian lenders hope no-interest cards can arrest a decline in usage and attract younger customers</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—Interest charges have been one of the defining features of credit cards for decades and so when an employee at a big Australian bank suggested getting rid of them, he was taking a risk.<br />“He said, ‘Well, what about a no-interest credit card?’ ” said Rachel Slade, personal banking group executive at  National Australia Bank Ltd. , recalling a feedback session at one of the lender’s Melbourne offices. “And everyone’s like, ‘What? That’s not how a credit card works.’ ”<br />Worried about dwindling credit-card usage during the coronavirus pandemic and the rapid rise of startups like Australia’s  Afterpay Ltd.  and Sweden’s Klarna Bank AB that allow consumers to pay for goods in installments, some banks are rethinking what has been one of their most lucrative businesses.<br />National Australia Bank, known locally as NAB, launched a no-interest credit card in September. Users get a fixed line of credit and the bank levies a monthly fee, which is refunded if the customer maintains a zero balance and doesn’t use the card.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia ,  the country’s largest lender by market value, also unveiled a no-interest card last year.<br />The experiment isn’t being replicated in the U.S. where most credit-card issuers charge interest when cardholders carry balances. But if they prove to be successful, Australian banks’ no-interest cards could drive change in other markets.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats said they plan to vote on impeaching President Trump on Wednesday, accusing him of inciting supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol, as Congress careened toward a fresh showdown over Mr. Trump’s behavior in the final days of the administration.<br />House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment on Monday morning and said they would move ahead regardless of tepid Republican support. While some Republicans have condemned the president for encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol as lawmakers were voting to ratify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, only a handful have expressed support for removing him from office through impeachment or other means.<br />Democrats would need a majority vote in the House to impeach the president, and a two-thirds supermajority in the Senate to convict. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has said there would be no time to conduct a trial and vote in the Senate before Inauguration Day, likely leaving the matter to the incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).<br />The Senate can hold a trial for Mr. Trump even after his presidency ends, which some lawmakers see as justified in both condemning Mr. Trump’s actions and potentially banning Mr. Trump from running again.<br />“Whether impeachment can pass the United States Senate is not the issue,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.). “The issue is, we have a president who most of us believe participated in encouraging an insurrection and attack on this building and on democracy.”</td>

      <td>The House could impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection, and a Senate trial could take place after he leaves office—or be delayed indefinitely</td>
      <td>The House of Representatives is preparing to impeach President Trump for a second time, just over a year after it first impeached him for pressing Ukraine to announce investigations that would have aided him politically. Here’s how the unprecedented process could play out.<br />The Constitution gives broad leeway to the House of Representatives to handle the impeachment process. There are no limits on the number of times someone may be impeached, though Mr. Trump would be the first person ever to be impeached more than once.<br />Because President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration is so soon, the practical effects of a second impeachment by the House would mostly be symbolic and dependent upon what the Senate decides to do. The Senate is currently adjourned and cannot reconvene until Jan. 19 unless it has the unanimous consent of all 100 members—something that is extremely unlikely to happen. That means that an impeachment trial, if the House sends over an article, can’t begin until Trump’s last full day in office at the earliest.<br />If the Senate proceeds to a trial and successfully convicts Mr. Trump, he couldn’t be removed from an office he didn’t hold. But the Senate could immediately hold a follow-up vote, subject only to a simple majority, to ban Mr. Trump—who has weighed another presidential run in 2024—from ever seeking office again. Those are the only punishments the Senate can consider as part of an impeachment conviction.<br />Yes. In fact, the precedent for holding articles of impeachment in the House after they are approved is just over a year old. During Mr. Trump’s first impeachment, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) waited several weeks to send over articles to the Senate while she and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fought over trial rules.</td>

The defendants have pleaded not guilty.<br />Colorado-based Pilgrim’s said Monday that the civil settlement remains subject to court approval, and that the company isn’t admitting to the chicken buyers’ claims. Lawsuits filed individually by major supermarket and restaurant chains remain outstanding, the company said.<br />Pilgrim’s and other U.S. chicken suppliers face ongoing lawsuits from some of their top customers, including chicken sandwich giant Chick-fil-A Inc., supermarket operators  Walmart Inc.  and  Kroger Co. , and food-service distributors  Sysco Corp.  and  US Foods Holding Corp.</td>

The conservative social network founded in 2018 exploded in popularity among supporters of President Trump after the November U.S. election.<br />“AWS’s decision to effectively terminate Parler’s account is apparently motivated by political animus.

The company said while it would no longer provide web services to Parler after Sunday at 11:59 p.m. Pacific time, it would preserve the platform’s data and help it migrate to different servers.<br />In its complaint, Parler also accused Amazon of applying a double standard than with other platforms, noting that Twitter had recently signed a multi-year web-hosting deal with the company.</td>

Daniel R. Hokanson, who is in charge of the National Guard Bureau, said in a press briefing Monday that the troop levels could rise to 15,000. He didn’t specify which states the Guard members would come from, whether they would be armed or the details of their mission.<br />The planned deployments represent an increase from the roughly 6,200 troops who arrived from six states in response to a pro-Trump mob’s violent attack on the Capitol Wednesday after the president urged his supporters to march on the legislature while lawmakers were meeting there to certify electoral votes. The bolstered force would be larger than contingents of Guardsmen at past inaugurations. Roughly 9,000 were in Washington for President Obama’s inauguration, Gen. Hokanson said.<br />The decision to deploy more Guard personnel came after military planners and local law enforcement evaluated their planned security posture and discussed how many more troops could be useful.<br />After Wednesday’s deadly assault on the Capitol, Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller formally approved deploying 6,200 Guardsmen from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and Maryland.

      <td>Jason Furman recapped “The Policy Lessons of the ‘Trump Economy’” (op-ed, Dec. 30) in a generally nonpartisan manner. Presidents are often at the mercy of uncontrollable events and the business cycle and an assessment of long-term results of a president’s policies based on shorter-term marginal benefits or detriments is dicey, at best. Mr. Furman’s summary of the difficulties in measuring a president’s policy results is welcome, although one doesn’t recall him saying during his time as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers that it was premature to give President’s Obama’s policies too much credit for an extended (but not very robust) recovery.<br />Joe Biden arguably gets the best of all policy-measurement worlds when he enters the White House. If the pandemic’s effects drag on, lockdowns take a new toll and the economy stalls or double dips into recession, Mr. Trump owns the downside. If the economy continues to recover, Mr. Biden clearly owns the 2021 upside, especially if he and the Democrats can advance another large stimulus package. A strong economic recovery based on effective vaccines and pent-up demand will be attributed to Mr. Biden’s policies, regardless of any more relevant measurement of long-term results.<br />A long-term perspective regarding economic polices is appropriate, but how can that happen when most media scorekeepers are partisans and campaigning for 2022 House and Senate races will begin in a few months?<br />Jeff Adams<br />Atlanta</td>

We’ve graduated more than 1,000 students from the program with a 97% student satisfaction rate. Although nearly all of our students are employed, more than half of them received a promotion or a new job opportunity during their time in our program.<br />We’ve embraced disruptive innovation in a sector that has traditionally been resistant, and the market has responded with enthusiasm—so much so, that we’ve expanded our online programs to include a master’s degree in accounting and another in management.<br />Employers still desire the skills provided by a high-quality M.B.A. education.

He suggests that the best way to celebrate diversity is to begin by celebrating “diversity of thought,” which can stem from “the value of true merit, or the real abilities of the people chosen to perform their jobs.”<br />What seems amiss here is that Mr. Epstein seems to insinuate that the race, color and gender type of diversity happens often as a trade-off to merit and accomplishment. But as made obvious by the résumés of President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet picks, to think that a candidate is picked for a job based on a race, color or gender factor alone is an outdated notion. Merit is the sine qua non in these competitive times. If anything, race, color and gender just add to enriching the diversity of thought.<br />Heidi H. Cha<br />New York<br /></td>

Ford’s factory footprint became too costly to support given the persistently difficult sales environment, a spokesman said.<br />Ford said it would take $4.1 billion in charges related to the restructuring, including $2.5 billion in cash charges. The charges will be divided between the fourth quarter of 2020 and this year.<br />Ford has struggled in overseas markets in recent years while leaning on its North American business and in-house lending arm to fuel profits. Through the first three quarters of 2020, Ford lost money in each of its regional businesses, South America, Europe and China.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Trump administration is putting Cuba back on the list of countries that are considered to be state sponsors of terrorism, a senior U.S. official said, rescinding a 2015 move by the Obama administration to thaw ties to the onetime Cold War adversary.<br />The redesignation, which will be announced Monday, may complicate President-elect Joe Biden’s efforts to improve ties with Havana. It is the latest in a series of foreign policy steps the administration has taken in recent days to try to lock in policies before it leaves office.<br />The State Department list to which Cuba is being added includes Syria, Iran and North Korea. Cuba was removed from that list in 2015 as the Obama administration sought to build ties with the country, part of a campaign that included boosting commercial air travel, the reopening of embassies and a visit by President Obama to the country.<br />Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to argue that the move is justified because Cuba has given refuge to an American convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in 1973 and to cite other complaints against the Cuban government.<br />A formal administration statement explaining the decision is expected to be issued later on Monday.</td>

Adjusted losses were $1.9 billion. The company didn’t disclose preliminary revenue figures in its press release, but a spokesman said revenue was in the tens of millions of dollars.<br />Carnival’s flagship line has paused all U.S. cruises through the end of March, while the company’s Princess Cruises and Holland America Line have also scrapped some voyages this year. The timing for U.S. voyages ultimately depends on receiving a permit from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is requiring operators to conduct mock sailings and apply for a certificate at least 60 days before offering passenger cruises.<br />The company said it expects to sell 19 less-efficient ships, which constitute roughly 13% of pre-pause capacity. Carnival said it previously expected to sell the ships in coming years and that 15 of those ships have already exited the fleet.<br />“With the aggressive actions we have taken, managing the balance sheet and reducing capacity, we are well-positioned to capitalize on pent-up demand and to emerge a leaner, more efficient company,” Chief Executive Arnold Donald said on a conference call.</td>

The organization, with a membership of more than 70,000, according to its website, is the largest voluntary bar association in the U.S.<br />While any lawyer who is disbarred is automatically stripped of membership, a spokeswoman for the organization, Susan DeSantis, said this is the first time the group has opened an inquiry into a current member since it adopted its bylaws in the 1970s.<br />The bar association said its inquiry will examine whether Mr. Giuliani’s actions during and after the presidential election violated the organization’s bylaws. The bar association said it had received hundreds of complaints in recent months about Mr. Giuliani stemming from his “baseless efforts” to cast doubt on the presidential election and overturn its results.<br />Last week, as Congress gathered to certify the results of the election, Mr. Giuliani spoke to crowds of thousands of Trump supporters at a Washington, D.C. rally, urging them to fight on. The bar association cited Mr. Giuliani’s exhortation to the crowds at Mr. Trump’s rally: “Let’s have trial by combat.”</td>

It is deteriorating rapidly,” said Dr. Daniele Bryden, a doctor and vice dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. “We know this is going to be a very difficult three weeks.”<br />The new variant—which scientists estimate is between 50% and 70% more transmissible than older versions—has combined with gatherings over Christmas to push daily new reported cases to record levels, government scientists say. New cases appear to be flattening out at high levels, but it will take time before any benefits feed through to hospitals.<br />There are now more people in the hospital than in any phase of the pandemic last April, with 32,300 Covid-19 patients hospitalized at present compared with around 21,700 in the spring.</td>

Previous efforts, including a deal worth $6.3 billion five years ago, were blocked by antitrust enforcers.

Both Office Depot and Staples have large e-commerce operations, but Office Depot’s revenue has suffered as many corporate offices have been closed. Closely held Staples doesn’t disclose its financial results.<br />After the last failed deal, Staples was taken private by Sycamore Partners, a hedge fund that has scooped up battered retail chains, in a leveraged buyout in 2017.

Margin trades use borrowed money to amplify investments.<br />The order came as bitcoin approached an all-time high of $41,962 on Friday, after more than tripling in 2020. Over the weekend, the world’s leading cryptocurrency went in reverse, shedding around a quarter of its value, and recently traded for $31,400, according to data from CoinDesk.<br />The move by eToro shows the topsy-turvy world of cryptocurrencies, where rapid price swings—often with little or no catalyst—can surprise investors and brokerages that cater to them. With margin trading, as an asset’s value increases, investors can increase their leverage, but also expose themselves and the brokerage to losses in the case of rapid pullback in prices.<br />The online brokerage said it had seen a frenzy of cryptocurrency activity in recent weeks. It added about 200,000 new registered users in the first week of the year, during which its platform saw several days of cryptocurrency trading volumes that were at 10 times the average of last year.</td>

The riot left five people dead and turned any interaction with the White House and commander in chief into an even more fraught decision than it has been at any point in the past four years.<br />The PGA of America said late Sunday it was stripping Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, N.J., of the 2022 PGA Championship. On Monday, the R&A, the body that oversees events such as the British Open, also said it had no plans to stage its championships at Turnberry, a golf resort in Scotland owned by Trump that has hosted four British Opens and two Women’s British Opens.<br />“We will not return until we are convinced that the focus will be on the championship, the players and the course itself and we do not believe that is achievable in the current circumstances,” Martin Slumbers, chief executive of the R&A, said in a statement.<br />Now, individuals like Belichick are left with the task of deciding whether to accept prestigious honors from Trump in the final days of his presidency—as Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, call for his removal in the wake of last week’s attack on the Capitol.</td>

By leaving them on the regular calendar, the Trump appeals won’t be scheduled for consideration until late January at earliest.<br />The justices are under no obligation to hear the cases, and few legal observers expect that they will.<br />The court’s action comes after a pro-Trump mob invaded the U.S. Capitol  Wednesday in a failed effort to thwart confirmation of Mr. Biden’s victory. After authorities reclaimed the Capitol, Congress reassembled to reject challenges to Biden victories in Arizona and Pennsylvania and then certified the Electoral College vote, 306 for Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump’s 232.<br />State and federal courts rejected more than 50 suits challenging Mr. Biden’s victories on various grounds. Those included procedural flaws, such as waiting too long before challenging election rules set months or more earlier, and substantive grounds, namely the failure to produce material evidence of fraud or misconduct after millions voted.</td>

Catholic women around the world have served as lectors and acolytes, kinds of liturgical assistants, for decades.<br />But until the new papal decree, released Monday, individual local bishops have been able to restrict those roles to men in their dioceses by citing church law.<br />Pope Francis wrote that codifying women’s participation in those roles would raise awareness “of the precious contribution that many lay persons, including women, have been offering for some time to the life and mission of the church.”<br />Pope Francis stressed that the roles of reader and altar server are lay ministries and thus don’t require ministers to be ordained as clergy.</td>

      <td>Congressional threats and inducements make Twitter and Facebook censorship a free-speech violation.</td>
      <td>Facebook  and  Twitter  banned President Trump and numerous supporters after last week’s disgraceful Capitol riot, and Google, Apple and  Amazon  blocked Twitter alternative Parler—all based on claims of “incitement to violence” and “hate speech.” Silicon Valley titans cite their ever-changing “terms of service,” but their selective enforcement suggests political motives.<br />Conventional wisdom holds that technology companies are free to regulate content because they are private, and the First Amendment protects only against government censorship. That view is wrong: Google, Facebook and Twitter should be treated as state actors under existing legal doctrines. Using a combination of statutory inducements and regulatory threats, Congress has co-opted Silicon Valley to do through the back door what government cannot directly accomplish under the Constitution.<br />It is “axiomatic,” the Supreme Court held in Norwood v. Harrison (1973), that the government “may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.” That’s what Congress did by enacting Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which not only permits tech companies to censor constitutionally protected speech but immunizes them from liability if they do so.<br />The justices have long held that the provision of such immunity can turn private action into state action. In Railway Employees’ Department v. Hanson (1956), they found state action in private union-employer closed-shop agreements—which force all employees to join the union—because Congress had passed a statute immunizing such agreements from liability under state law. In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association(1989), the court again found state action in private-party conduct—drug tests for company employees—because federal regulations immunized railroads from liability if they conducted those tests. In both cases, as with Section 230, the federal government didn’t mandate anything; it merely pre-empted state law, protecting certain private parties from lawsuits if they engaged in the conduct Congress was promoting.<br />Section 230 is the carrot, and there’s also a stick: Congressional Democrats have repeatedly made explicit threats to social-media giants if they failed to censor speech those lawmakers disfavored. In April 2019, Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond warned Facebook and Google that they had “better” restrict what he and his colleagues saw as harmful content or face regulation: “We’re going to make it swift, we’re going to make it strong, and we’re going to hold them very accountable.” New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler added: “Let’s see what happens by just pressuring them.”</td>

      <td>Yes, the left does bad things too. Conservatives are supposed to believe in objective moral truth.</td>
      <td>It’s a measure of the depravity to which our national political conversation has fallen that however bad one side’s latest transgression against norms, morality or the law, there’s always something it can point to that the other side did first. The earlier outrage may not exactly justify the latest offense. But by reminding an already highly partisan audience that there is prior sinfulness in the actions of your opponents, you can dilute the negative public impact of your own wrongdoing or, at a minimum, apply some balm to a troubled private conscience.<br />This equivalence play, or “whataboutism,” can, if we’re not careful, neuter all efforts to hold our leaders’ actions to some objective standard. It inflicts on all judgments the terminal paralysis of moral relativism. As with the widespread undermining of objective factual truth in recent years, so the erosion of the idea of objective moral truth steadily weakens the foundations of political and civil community and softens us up for a final descent into the invented truths of totalitarianism.<br />In the wake of last week’s violent incursion at the U.S. Capitol, President Trump’s supporters have been working overtime on the moral-equivalence shift.<br />Sure, the president’s claims of a stolen election are dubious, but they’re nothing worse than what Democrats and the media did for four years in promoting the false Russia-collusion story, refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Trump presidency, and trying to destroy it.<br />Yes, the violence at the Capitol was terrible, but so too was the mayhem perpetrated by Black Lives Matter and antifa in dozens of American cities last summer.</td>

They are fearful of triggering lease provisions that kick in when key anchor retailers or a certain number of tenants leave a certain property, cutting rents for those that remain.<br />“In light of the pandemic, people are worried about empty stores and worried about traffic in their malls,” said Saul Burian, managing director at investment bank  Houlihan Lokey Inc.  “Some are even worried about hitting thresholds of vacancies that could have other consequences either with respect to other tenants, or with respect to their debt.”<br />Landlords who feel that they won’t be able to quickly replace tenants have the least leverage in negotiations, said Beth Azor, founder and owner of commercial real-estate advisory and investment firm Azor Advisory Services Inc., which owns and manages six shopping centers in South Florida.</td>

The news boosted Lilly’s market value by nearly $20 billion.<br />Those benefits will need to be confirmed in a larger trial. Sadly, the drug industry has had several prospective Alzheimer’s drugs that showed promise and created stock market gains but eventually fizzled out. The Lilly data are from just 272 patients.<br />Of course, the financial benefits of being the first to crack the code would be massive. There are 5 million Americans currently living with the fatal disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. The population is aging, so that figure is likely headed higher in the years ahead. The disease has a severe impact on quality of life, so demand would be high even for a drug that just slows disease progression.<br />Lilly now has a chance to be first in class. U.S. regulators are set to decide whether to approve Biogen’s experimental treatment aducanumab by March 7. But an advisory panel of outside experts convened by the Food and Drug Administration in November voted overwhelmingly that the best available data doesn’t show the drug is sufficiently effective.</td>

      <td>With the pandemic overloading many emergency rooms and ICUs, the hospital isn’t always the best place to seek treatment for some ailments</td>
      <td>With emergency rooms and ICUs across the country overloaded, a trip to the hospital can mean greater pandemic-related risks. According to the Covid Tracking Project, more than 132,000 people are in hospital with Covid-19, with the majority of states reporting record hospitalizations. That affects not just emergency departments but staffing and space throughout entire hospitals, which usually isolate Covid patients to prevent infection.<br />That is complicating the decision to go to the emergency room. Here’s what doctors and other medical authorities advise.<br />When are urgent-care clinics the best option?<br />If you aren’t experiencing heart attack or stroke symptoms, some lesser emergencies may be easier addressed outside the ER, said Andra Blomkalns, chair of the emergency medicine department at Stanford University. This is critical if hospitals in your area are near capacity. “If you have a sprained ankle, it’s probably not the time to go to the hospital,” she said. Many urgent-care clinics also post waiting times and can do sutures, X-rays and other diagnostic testing.<br />Remember that your gut reaction can be misleading. Research shows that people can’t always judge whether they are experiencing a health emergency, said Charleen Hsuan, professor of health policy and administration at Pennsylvania State University, adding, “in general, patients aren’t necessarily good at telling when something is a real emergency or not.”</td>

      <td>President-elect Joe Biden faces a lot of tough choices as he heads into office, but he now confronts a particularly fraught one: Does he play the role of avenger or conciliator?<br />It is a no-win proposition.<br />The stream of videos, pictures and sounds that continue to emerge from inside a Capitol under siege last week are showing in more graphic detail the horrors that unfolded when a pro-Trump mob showed up to try to stop the confirmation of Mr. Biden’s election over unproven charges of election fraud. One man ran through the Senate gallery carrying zip ties, the only logical use for which would be to handcuff hostages. The crowd chanted that Vice President Mike Pence, who was in the building, should be hanged.<br />A group of staff members of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hid under a conference table while the crowd outside, in search of the speaker, tried to break down the door. Two police officers who tried to defend the Capitol have died, one after having been hit in the head with a fire extinguisher.<br />Even Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager and White House counselor, responded over the weekend with a tweet saying, “Don’t avert your eyes & don’t excuse this. The more we see & learn, the worse it is.”</td>

      <td>Scientists say even vaccinated people need to take Covid precautions</td>
      <td>Do the Covid vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus, or do they just protect you from getting sick?<br />Scientists don’t know yet—and the uncertainty has big implications during the rollout of the vaccines.<br />Pfizer  and Moderna, the companies that developed the vaccines authorized in the U.S. so far, say their vaccines are about 95% effective at preventing people from getting sick with Covid symptoms. But there’s not enough evidence yet on whether the vaccines also prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission.<br />The companies say research is ongoing to determine the answer. Without vaccines, research has suggested that asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus that causes Covid is responsible for roughly a quarter of infections.<br />The result, experts say, is that precautions like wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding crowded spaces will be necessary until the country gets closer to herd immunity, the point at which enough people are immune to a disease to make its spread unlikely. Some studies have estimated roughly 75% to 80% of the U.S. population needs to be immune to Covid-19 to reach herd immunity, but that number is a moving target and could rise as new variants emerge.</td>

Recent polls suggest Mr. Netanyahu will need to retain and expand his support among the right-wing and religious camps if he is to fight off his challenger and retain his post as Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.<br />Mr. Netanyahu’s path to forming a coalition is narrowing, according to a poll released Monday by Israel’s Radio 103 FM. Without the New Hope party led by a former ally-turned-rival, Gideon Saar, and another right-wing party headed by Naftali Bennett, his coalition has only 46 seats. He needs 61 to form a government.<br />Mr. Saar on Monday urged Mr. Netanyahu to recognize Jewish settlements in the West Bank that are considered illegal under Israeli law.</td>

It is an emerging rival to two, long-dominant proprietary models from  Intel Corp.  and Arm Holdings Ltd., a British company that U.S. graphics-chip maker  Nvidia Inc.  agreed in September to acquire for $40 billion.<br />The standard is winning global interest, and early users include Chinese online retail and tech giant  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , which developed what some industry insiders consider the highest-performance RISC-V chip in production. Alibaba has said it is using that chip in its data centers to perform artificial intelligence calculations, and is selling versions of it.<br />Widespread adoption of RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” could open the door for China to accelerate efforts to end its dependence on Western chip technology, threaten licensing revenues for Arm and could aid the rise of new rivals to incumbent chip makers, industry executives and analysts said.<br />“China wants to have its own architecture, but also an architecture where license fees won’t have to be paid. So we see a strong buildup of RISC-V in China,” said Handel Jones, the chief executive of International Business Strategies Inc., an industry consulting and analysis firm.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The storming of the Capitol by President Trump’s supporters is expected to turbocharge Congressional efforts to regulate big tech—and many lawmakers are expected to focus on scaling back the liability shield that protects internet companies.<br />The Capitol incursion, some of which was planned and discussed in advance on social media, has hardened many Democrats’ view that a lack of tech-platform regulation is undermining democracy. Georgia’s election of two Democratic Senators last week shifted a divided Congress to Democrats’ control, improving the chances of passing legislation targeting consumer-data privacy, tech companies’ market power and the liability shield known as Section 230.<br />“The bottom line is that the odds of legislative action on privacy, antitrust and 230 just went up significantly,” said Blair Levin, a policy analyst with equity research firm New Street Research. “The party that wants to legislate now has the power to put a bill on the Senate floor, and on all those issues there are Republicans likely to join with Democrats.”<br />Republicans have their own issues with big internet companies, asserting that they are abusing their power to silence conservative voices on their platforms. Many Republicans support rewriting Section 230, and some claim that tech companies are shifting further left to appease Democrats expanding their power in Washington.<br />After the Capitol riot,  Twitter Inc.  permanently banned Mr. Trump and  Facebook Inc.  indefinitely suspended him, citing his role in fanning violence, while  Apple Inc.,   Amazon.com Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google cut off support for the Parler social-media app on grounds that it doesn’t adequately police content that could incite violence.</td>

That compares to clinical trial results out of Brazil last week showing the vaccine had an efficacy rate of 78%.<br />Indonesia’s trial showed that CoronVac was safe, with participants experiencing only minor side effects like fatigue and fever, according to Penny Lukito, the head of Indonesia’s National Agency of Drug and Food Control. “Hopefully vaccines for Covid-19 will be one of the factors in overcoming this pandemic,” she said.<br />A rate of 65% exceeds the 50% threshold that the World Health Organization and many regulatory authorities consider necessary for widespread use. Western vaccines developed by Moderna Inc. and jointly by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have reported their vaccines to be more than 90% effective; another developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca PLC was at least 62% effective, according to the team.<br />Authorities in Brazil have yet to approve CoronaVac for use, although President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration has backed down from its previous criticism of Chinese vaccines and agreed to buy up to 100 million shots of the vaccine.</td>

      <td>Southern European austerity budgets left the region ill-prepared for the virus</td>
      <td>MILAN—Claudio Zanon has seen firsthand how less spending on health care in recent years left Italy exposed when the coronavirus began sweeping through his country early last year.<br />Dr. Zanon, who until the end of December was the medical director at a hospital in Como in Italy’s hard-hit Lombardy region, says when the pandemic arrived he didn’t have enough doctors and nurses. Intensive-care unit beds were scarce and there wasn’t a large network of local clinics to help take the strain. With money tight, technology used in the hospital had also fallen behind.<br />“Italy was unprepared when the first coronavirus wave hit because the health-care system hasn’t received adequate funding in recent years,” said Dr. Zanon, who practiced as a surgeon for three decades. “If investments don’t keep up, you will inevitably see the negative results at a certain point.”<br />Lower relative spending on health care in the wake of the financial crisis became a fixture of the past decade in Italy and other Southern European countries. Budgetary belt tightening partly explains why some countries suffered higher infection rates and death tolls in the pandemic, according to health-care experts and doctors who have been on the front line treating patients.<br />Per capita private and public spending on health care, adjusted for inflation, fell by 2.6% in Italy between 2009 and 2019, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Greece, it plunged by almost a third. Health-care costs tend to rise faster than overall inflation, because of the rising health-care needs of aging populations as well as technological advances, so even keeping spending constant often requires cutting something, such as staff or services offered.</td>

      <td>An  Apple  car, if it is ever launched, would be a big deal. But the potential rewards for manufacturers come with a sting.<br />Shares in Hyundai Motor Company rose 9% Monday after a Korean newspaper reported that the car maker plans to sign an agreement with Apple for an autonomous electric vehicle. The stock had already jumped 19% on Friday, when Hyundai said it was in early-stage discussions with the iPhone designer.<br />Apple started to work on a vehicle in 2014, but the project has progressed fitfully and the company has rarely acknowledged it publicly. A Reuters report last month said it was targeting a 2024 launch, which would be very ambitious for anything with a meaningful degree of autonomy. Hyundai would likely be a production partner, akin to the role Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn plays in iPhone assembly.<br />For all the glamour—and potential manufacturing volumes—of being associated with an Apple-branded car, the almost $15 billion gain in Hyundai’s market value since Thursday’s close is hard to justify. Besides the risks that the talks come to nothing, or that any project drains cash for longer than expected, contract manufacturing isn’t an especially attractive business.<br />Canadian supplier  Magna International ,  which is also seen as a potential partner for Apple, assembles vehicles under other brands, notably the Jaguar I-Pace, an all-electric sport-utility vehicle. The activity hasn’t been very profitable. Magna’s “complete vehicles” division reported operating margins of 2.1% and 1.1% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, lower than at its parts businesses.</td>

These could include bitcoin, loyalty points and reward programs, like those offered by  Starbucks Corp.  and airlines, and virtual assets from videogames.<br />More than 400,000 people preregistered for the app, which is expected to have a wide public rollout in March, Bakkt says. Bakkt projects the app will amass more than 30 million users in five years, according to a presentation about the deal released on Monday. That ambitious target would put Bakkt in the same league as other blockbuster financial apps like Robinhood, Venmo or  Square Inc.’s  Cash App.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden plans to nominate William J. Burns, a former career diplomat with 33 years of service, as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency.<br />Mr. Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia and Jordan and a former deputy secretary of state who served under Republican and Democratic administrations, retired in 2014 and serves as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.<br />“Bill Burns is an exemplary diplomat with decades of experience on the world stage keeping our people and our country safe and secure,” Mr. Biden said. “He shares my profound belief that intelligence must be apolitical and that the dedicated intelligence professionals serving our nation deserve our gratitude and respect.”<br />While not an intelligence agency professional, Mr. Burns has experience with sensitive national security matters.<br />Following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, he and senior CIA officials met quietly with Libya’s then-intelligence chief, Musa Kusa, forging a settlement over the Pan Am 103 terrorist attack and dictator Moammar Gadhafi’s agreement to abandon weapons of mass destruction programs.</td>
