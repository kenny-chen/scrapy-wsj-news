      <td>WILMINGTON, Del.—President-elect Joe Biden forcefully denounced the storming of the U.S. Capitol by pro-Trump rioters, calling it an unprecedented assault on the nation’s democracy that “borders on sedition.”<br />He urged President Trump to publicly “demand an end to this siege.”<br />“It’s not protest,” Mr. Biden said. “It’s insurrection.”<br />Mr. Biden, who spent more than three decades in the Senate, addressed the nation two weeks before his inauguration.<br />Mr. Trump released a video statement around the time Mr. Biden was making his remarks, telling supporters at the U.S. Capitol to leave and that he felt their pain over the election. He also continued to make baseless claims of a fraudulent election. “So go home,” he said. “We love you. You’re very special.”</td>

      <td>Republicans objecting to state electors should stop and certify Joe Biden’s election by acclamation.</td>
      <td>Fueled by lies about a stolen election, protesters overran police and stormed America’s seat of government on Wednesday, forcing a lockdown of the U.S. Capitol and a 6 p.m. city curfew. This sounds like a dispatch from some foreign correspondent in an unfortunate land. Instead it was President Trump’s parting gift to Washington, and the country, for denying him a second term.<br />Wednesday’s joint session of Congress was supposed to be a ritual of American democracy, memorializing Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. As lawmakers met, Mr. Trump was speaking at a “Save America March,” where he vowed never to concede. “We’re going to the Capitol,” he urged the crowd, to “try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.”<br />There the protesters marched—and then some. After Rep. Paul Gosar and Sen. Ted Cruz objected to the counting of Arizona’s 11 electors, the two chambers retired to consider it. The Senate debate lasted less than an hour. Rioters breached the building, and the Vice President was suddenly whisked from the floor. In the House, lawmakers said they were given gas masks and told to lie on the floor. A woman was shot and killed, and police officers were injured.<br />What a disgrace. The trespassers should be arrested, and the maskless ones can probably be identified long after the fact. Where was the police presence in Washington? Once the mob was inside, the call went out for backup from Virginia and Maryland, and the National Guard was activated. But it’s a scandal that the U.S. Capitol wasn’t better protected on such a significant day.<br />To the extent that the congressional debate was allowed to happen, it went in the right direction. Mr. Trump has been publicly pressuring Mr. Pence, the presiding officer of the joint session, to invalidate Mr. Biden’s electors. As Congress gathered, Mr. Pence released a statement saying he would refuse to do so. “My oath to support and defend the Constitution,” he wrote, “constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.”</td>

      <td>National Guard, FBI and others sent to the scene after the U.S. Capitol was breached</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal authorities had planned to deal with protests this week with a relatively small, minimally visible presence, according to law-enforcement officials, hoping to avoid inflaming tensions as a show of force had done during unrest earlier this year in Portland, Ore. and other cities.<br />That approach seemed to have backfired on Wednesday, when thousands of pro-Trump rioters surrounded the U.S. Capitol and some easily breached the barricades and stormed the building, leaving at least one person shot and others injured. Some fired what the city’s police chief described as “chemical irritants” at officers who were guarding the complex to gain access to the building.<br />That left a smaller group of Capitol police officers to guard the building as lawmakers began a joint session of Congress to count the 2020 electoral votes. Those officers were quickly outnumbered as rioters approached the building. Once inside, they broke into lawmakers’ offices and roamed freely.<br />Officials said they had expected a repeat of relatively minor scuffles between far-right and far-left factions that broke out after dark at similar protests in November.<br />“The Capitol Police were unprepared for the sheer size of the protest,” said David Gomez, a retired FBI executive. Once the rioters barged into the Capitol, other federal law enforcement agencies were slow to respond, either out of deference to President Trump or because of a lack of experience with dealing with riots, which isn’t their primary mission, Mr. Gomez said. “Up until they breached the Capitol, the possibility existed that it was going to be a large protest that didn’t cross those barricades. Once they did that [law enforcement personnel] were overwhelmed and couldn’t respond quickly enough,” he said.</td>

Data-mining firm  Palantir Technologies Inc.,  streaming service  Spotify Technology SA  and workplace messaging platform  Slack Technologies Inc.  went public via direct listings.<br />A Series H funding round led by Altimeter Capital and Dragoneer Investment Group placed the company’s shares at $45 apiece, bringing its valuation to a total of $29.5 billion. The company was valued at $4 billion following a $150 million raise in February 2020.<br />The Investment Group of Santa Barbara and Warner Music Group also participated in the funding round, as did several of its existing investors.<br />The company said the proceeds will go toward Roblox’s growth initiatives and platform that will enable shared experiences among its billions of users.</td>

They were in the early stages Wednesday afternoon when rioters disputing Mr. Biden’s victory over President Trump overtook the Capitol, forcing lawmakers and aides to seek shelter.<br />“We always knew this responsibility would take us into the night. The night may still be long but we are hopeful for a shorter agenda, but our purpose will be accomplished,” Mrs. Pelosi wrote.<br />Many lawmakers had been eager to resume the certification of the vote, saying they didn’t want to let the mob prevent them from fulfilling their constitutional role.</td>

Go home with love & in peace.” Twitter labeled the tweet with a notice that the claim of election fraud was disputed. The posts and the video were later removed altogether.<br />Both the House and Senate chambers had gaveled out of session shortly after 2 p.m. local time after rioters breached the Capitol. Mr. Trump spoke to protesters who had shown up earlier that day at an event on the Ellipse, near the White House, saying he wouldn’t concede and urging them to go to the Capitol.</td>

      <td>The D.C. Circuit judge could bring sober leadership to Justice.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden promised to lower the temperature of America’s partisan hothouse, but some of his nominations have not lived up to that promise. One that does is his selection of Merrick Garland as Attorney General, perhaps now the most important cabinet post for domestic politics.<br />Public confidence in the Department of Justice has been severely damaged in recent years, not least the last four, as it became clear that President Trump’s partisan adversaries manipulated the FBI and Justice Department to try to handicap his Administration. Mr. Trump toward the end of his term also increasingly demanded that the Justice Department be weaponized in reverse. Attorney General Bill Barr refused and did his best to depoliticize prosecutorial decisions.<br />The Biden Administration will face pressure from the left to pursue Republicans who worked in the Trump Administration, banana-republic style, along the lines Sen. Elizabeth Warrencalled for in her presidential campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris said in 2019 she would have “no choice” but to prosecute Mr. Trump for obstruction of justice if elected President.<br />But Mr. Garland, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judge whom President Obama unsuccessfully nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016, is unlikely to have signed up for a job of political recrimination. For more than two decades he has been a mainstream center-left judge with a calm temperament and no demonstrated interest in settling scores or legal “Resistance.”<br />Mr. Garland’s experience as a prosecutor during the high-crime 1990s may help balance anti-police sentiment in the Administration. His vaunted status among Democrats, who feel he was wronged by the 2016 Republican decision not to seat him on the Supreme Court, might give him more credibility to make decisions that disappoint progressives.</td>

      <td>His relentless attacks on the state’s election apparatus likely depressed Republican turnout.</td>
      <td>The Democrats’ twin victories in Tuesday’s Georgia Senate runoffs create a political dynamic in Washington that isn’t out of line with recent precedent. Joe Biden will enter the presidency, after wresting it from the other party, with majorities for his party in both houses of Congress. Bill Clinton managed the same feat in 1993. So did George W. Bush in 2001, Barack Obama in 2009 and Donald Trump in 2017. Indeed, the Bush Republican majorities in 2001 (51-50 in the Senate and 221-213 in the House) were almost identical to the Biden Democratic majorities now (51-50 in the Senate and 222-211 in the House).<br />In no case did these majorities lead to long-term control of the federal government. Messrs. Clinton, Obama and Trump saw their parties lose one or both houses of Congress two years after taking office. In 2001, Mr. Bush’s Republicans lost their Senate majority in five months when Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords switched parties. The GOP regained its Senate majority in 2002 and 2004, in both cases picking up a seat in Georgia.<br />For nearly two decades, Georgia seemed an impenetrable Republican stronghold. The party’s candidates won every presidential, gubernatorial and senatorial race there from 2002-18. But this year, affluent voters in metro Atlanta, like their counterparts in Houston, Dallas and Phoenix, started inching away from the Republicans, as affluent voters in the Northeast, Midwest and West Coast did starting in the 1990s. An increasing black population—many moving from cities like Chicago and Detroit—has contributed to the rising Democratic tide across the South. Georgia, Texas and Arizona are now presidential target states.<br />Voters in Georgia’s cities and suburbs recoiled against Mr. Trump, for reasons of both style and substance. He lost Georgia to Mr. Biden in November by a margin of 49.5% to 49.3%, then he lost his party’s two Senate seats in the runoff.<br />Tuesday’s result wasn’t inevitable. In November Sen. David Perdue edged Democrat Jon Ossoff 49.7% to 47.9%. In the special all-party election for the vacancy created by the resignation of Sen. Johnny Isakson, Republican candidates led Democrats by an almost identical margin: 49.4% to 48.4%. But under Georgia law, Mr. Perdue’s failure to win an absolute majority put him in a runoff against Mr. Ossoff. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, appointed to replace Mr. Isakson, squared off in a head-to-head battle with the lead Democrat, the Rev. Raphael Warnock.</td>

      <td>The jailed Hong Kong democracy activist isn’t giving up.</td>
      <td>Jimmy Lai began 2021 in jail. The detention last month of the prominent Hong Kong businessman and democracy activist suggested that the Chinese Communist Party was looking to crack down on dissent. The hammer dropped Tuesday morning, with the mass arrest of 53 other democracy proponents in Hong Kong.<br />The jailings may lead to an early test for the Biden administration. While Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were celebrated as Time magazine’s “Persons of the Year” for winning an election, it is not clear if they will stand with those fighting for the right to have elections at all.<br />From a global perspective, the big story of 2020 was China’s government: its duplicity around Covid, the continuing expansion of its surveillance state, and its mass forced incarceration and indoctrination of Uighurs in 380 detention centers across the Xianjing region. China is flexing its muscles in Hong Kong unchecked. It is time the rest of the world stood up for the norms of free societies, including free speech and the rule of law.<br />Mr. Lai’s case should draw world-wide attention to what is being lost in Hong Kong. At 12, he smuggled himself out of mainland China by boat, reaching Hong Kong penniless but ambitious. Sixty years later, his success embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of a free Hong Kong; from nothing he built a clothing store empire, then a newspaper and media conglomerate. His newspaper,  Apple  Daily, is the second-most read paper in Hong Kong.<br />Those accomplishments are impressive, but what he is most passionate about, and what keeps him up at night, is Hong Kong’s democracy movement. When I interviewed him in early November, he said “I really appreciate the freedom in Hong Kong. This freedom has given us all that we have. Hope. Inspiration. This is so precious. With my gratitude to this place, it is my duty to do whatever I can to fight for freedom and the rule of law here.”</td>

      <td>The Senate is lost, the GOP is bitterly split and Trump’s actions have consequences.</td>
      <td>President Trump may have been correct at his Monday rally when he said of Georgia Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler: “If they win I’ll get no credit, and if they lose they’re going to blame Trump.” But Tuesday’s election and Wednesday’s mob assault on Congress were stark examples of the destructive reactions the president can generate.<br />One Trump effect was felt in Atlanta’s suburbs. In Clayton County in November, Democrat Jon Ossoff had a 71-point lead; on Tuesday it was 77. In DeKalb Mr. Ossoff led by 64 points in November; on Tuesday he led by 67. In Gwinnett he led by 16 points in November and 20 on Tuesday. In Fulton, the state’s most populous county, Mr. Ossoff’s November lead was 41.6 points; on Tuesday, 43 points. These were enough to erase Mr. Perdue’s 88,000 vote lead in November and propel Mr. Ossoff to a narrow victory.<br />Mr. Trump tried to turn out his rural Georgia supporters, but the results were uneven and insufficient. Take the 14th Congressional District, which the president visited Monday. In November it had roughly 328,000 voters turn out; on Tuesday only 282,000 voted there, though there are several thousand ballots still outstanding.<br />A key factor was the decision by many independents and soft Republicans to vote Democrat—largely, it appears, in response to Mr. Trump’s actions since the presidential election. These helped Democrats make the race about Mr. Trump and undermined GOP efforts to highlight the Democratic candidates’ left-wing views and present a Republican Senate as a check on Democrats in Washington.<br />Mr. Trump’s unrelenting personal attacks on Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger also drew attention away from the Senate race while igniting an intraparty civil war. That rarely leads to anything productive. It didn’t here.</td>

      <td>Most companies benefiting from the Fed’s bond buys didn’t need the cash, and didn’t spend it well either.</td>
      <td>Conservatives accuse progressives of wanting to destroy capitalism. Yet a greater threat than Bernie Sanders is the prospect of serial market bailouts by monetary authorities—first the banking system in 2008, and now the entire business world amid the pandemic. The Treasury Department and Congress have moved to curtail the Federal Reserve’s ability to prop up already bloated corporate debt markets. That’s a step in the right direction—the Fed’s corporate credit facilities should be left to die.<br />The creation of the corporate facilities last March marked the first time in history that the Fed would buy corporate debt. The plan went far beyond previous quantitative easing, in which the Fed bought up government-backed securities. The purpose of the corporate facilities was to help companies access debt markets during the pandemic, making it possible to sustain operations and keep employees on payroll. Instead, the facilities resulted in a huge and unnecessary bailout of corporate debt issuers, underwriters and bondholders.<br />The disruptions in the corporate debt market had largely dissipated by the end of March. Since that time, there has been no liquidity shortage for large companies. Corporate bond issuance in 2020 reached $2.3 trillion, exceeding the previous yearly record by more than 35%. In fact, large companies raised more money from private lenders during the difficult early months of 2020 than they raised during the same period in 2019.<br />There isn’t much evidence that all of this cash went toward creating and preserving jobs in the U.S. And the Fed did nothing to ensure that, declining to limit its corporate debt purchases to companies with significant U.S. workforces or prevent debt proceeds from being used for outsize executive compensation or shareholder distributions, even though Congress considered such limits when it approved the facilities. A House committee report found that companies benefiting from the facilities laid off more than one million workers from March to September. That includes  Boeing ,  which laid off 16,000 employees, and  Sysco ,  a food service company that laid off a third of its workforce while continuing to pay its shareholders a dividend.<br />While there’s little evidence that the Fed’s corporate debt buy-up benefited society, its costs and unintended consequences are significant, with clear damage to competitiveness and productivity.</td>

Once public, the company has no operations. It simply holds cash—typically, $200 million to $400 million—and has two years to find a private company with which to merge and thereby bring public. The sponsor invests some of its own capital in the SPAC as well but takes an additional 20% interest in the SPAC at a nominal price.<br />Most investment in SPAC IPOs comes from hedge funds known in the market as the “SPAC Mafia.” The sponsor’s pitch to these funds is simple: Invest in “units” containing one share and one or two additional securities—a “right” and/or a warrant. The price is $10 per unit, but if you don’t want to participate in the merger, you can redeem your shares for $10 plus interest and keep the warrants and rights for free.<br />This is a tremendous deal for IPO investors who redeem their shares. A right gives a unit holder an additional one-tenth of a SPAC share when the merger is complete. A typical warrant gives the holder an option to buy between one-half and one share at an exercise price of $11.50 any time over five years following the SPAC’s merger. On average, if an investor buys units in a SPAC public offering, redeems its shares and keeps or sells its warrants and rights, the investor’s annualized return is more than 10% with no downside risk.<br />We studied SPACs that completed mergers between January 2019 and June 2020 and found that, on average, they lost 12% of their value within six months following the merger, while the Nasdaq rose roughly 30%. Even with these drops in share price, the 20% that the sponsor gets essentially for free provides a nice return on its investment. The sponsors of these SPACs enjoyed a return on investment of more than 500% as of the end of 2020.</td>

We may be there.<br />For the last half of his Monday evening rally in Georgia for Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Mr. Trump read from the teleprompter a detailed description of the ways he believes election fraud was committed in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The two Republicans then lost.<br />On Wednesday in Washington, Mr. Trump delivered the same speech to a massive crowd, which then invaded the Capitol building, forcing the evacuation of Vice President Mike Pence and a general lockdown.<br />Political mockery is merciless, and so it was this week with the appearance of a viral video that recreates Mr. Trump making these election-fraud accusations seated at his desk in the Oval Office—“the numbers are corrupt, it was a rigged election, 100%”—as workmen remove the desk, with him attached to it, out of the office, down a White House hall and into the back of a truck, while he insists: “There’s tremendous fraud here. Wait just one second . . .”<br />That second has passed.</td>

      <td>Belief in capitalism’s impending demise is as old as capitalism itself, and is rooted in an even older philosophy of utopian thinking.</td>
      <td>Never judge a book by its cover. And never, probably, begin a review by quoting that line. But I think it’s appropriate here. For as I gazed at the cover of Francesco Boldizzoni’s “Foretelling the End of Capitalism: Intellectual Misadventures Since Karl Marx” and noticed the presence of the Grim Reaper, I prepared myself for a detailed discussion of the millenarianism that has characterized leftist thinking, not only since Marx but indeed long before him.<br />Such a study would involve an investigation into the religious or quasireligious reasons that have underpinned belief in capitalism’s impending downfall. Their origins stretch back to antiquity, stemming from a desire to overturn the existing order—whatever that might be—and replace it with a heaven on earth. Mr. Boldizzoni offers a glimpse of this: “Fantasies about . . . the second coming of Christ, and speculation about the advent of a classless society, were not different in function. In both cases, at stake were the restoration of justice and the just rewards of the deserving at the end of the turbulent process of contemporary life.”<br />Despite some backward glances, however, Mr. Boldizzoni’s narrative focuses mainly on the mid-19th century and later, when the rise of capitalism was quickly accompanied by the first forecasts of its replacement. Drastic social change raised questions of whether it was the right social change. As Mr. Boldizzoni demonstrates, those expecting capitalism’s eclipse went beyond the usual suspects: John Stuart Mill turns up, as does John Maynard Keynes. Both looked forward to a time when humanity would be prosperous enough to rise above grubby, sharp-elbowed capitalism, a vision that perhaps reflected their own privileged backgrounds more than anything else.<br />This book is a sprawling, informative, thought-provoking and opinionated history of ideas. Mr. Boldizzoni, a professor of political science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, focuses here on those who have anticipated—for the most part, eagerly—the demise of capitalism. However, despite shout-outs to protocommunists like Friar Tommaso Campanella (1568-1639), the author’s relative neglect of earlier thinkers who wanted to see the world turned upside down means that the story begins halfway through.<br />That said, the predictions of capitalism’s extinction made in the past 200 years or so are of considerable interest. There were, for example, Depression-era writers who thought, with more than a nod to Marx, that underconsumption would bring capitalism down. Such doomsayers have (so far) been proved wrong, but their analyses can be well worth the effort Mr. Boldizzoni puts into examining them, even if some are treated with more seriousness than they deserve—out of a deference maybe to the author’s own political inclinations. On the other hand, his adherence to, roughly speaking, midcentury social democracy—an “arguably . . . mild variety of capitalism” with its strong unions, mixed economy and generous welfare state—also gives him valuable distance from his subjects.</td>

Per Mr. Warsh once again, these policies are consistent with “better, safer returns” for investors whose capital commitments drive all economic growth. Wealth isn’t taken from a fixed pie as some who fear China’s rise apparently assume; rather it’s created. It’s a reminder that Beijing’s efforts to lure investors aren’t a threat to the U.S. as much as they’re a positive incentive for the U.S. to similarly pursue better policies. What will make China rich will also lift the U.S. Growth is a choice.<br />John Tamney<br />Washington<br />If, as maintained by many, it is in our interest to be less intertwined with mainland China, then it would seem good for China to be holding less U.S. debt.

      <td>Hartford has its share of self-inflicted wounds. But many of them—like pension obligations—are the product of decisions made long ago by folks who later decamped to surrounding towns to take advantage of government-backed loans that favored suburbia. Although Bob Stefanowski lambastes regionalism, it’s actually common in the southern and western regions that Connecticut Republicans seem to view as the promised land (“What Isn’t the Matter With Hartford?,” Cross Country, Jan. 2). Hartford is 18 square miles; Charlotte, N.C., is 309 and growing.<br />Mr. Stefanowski argues that Hartford needs pension and other structural reforms, but he criticizes Mayor Luke Bronin for drawing up bankruptcy plans. Mr. Stefanowski acknowledges that bankruptcy would have been a black eye for Connecticut, but he pans the state’s decision to help Hartford avoid it. He disparages the state’s financial support as a bailout, but he notes that Hartford suffers from large amounts of tax-exempt property—like government buildings and hospitals and cultural institutions that serve the region. The incoherence is dizzying.<br />In fact, Mr. Bronin has made difficult cuts and held the line on taxes. But he has also challenged our region to recognize that the system is broken.

      <td>The long-rumored plan to make classicism the sanctioned style for federal architecture recently became a reality when President Trump issued the “Executive Order on Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture” last month. This may seem like an inconsequential action in the waning days of the administration, but unless it’s revoked by Joe Biden once he assumes the presidency it will endure, threatening to do lasting damage.<br />The document begins promisingly, with indirect invocations of the ancient Roman writer Vitruvius and his principles of firmitas, utilitas and venustas, or strength, utility and beauty. It continues with a mention of medieval Siena, a model of a well-designed city with generous public spaces.<br />But it quickly descends into a nonsensical tirade against imagined enemies, such as Brutalists and Deconstructivists (styles that are hardly of the moment). It sets up a false opposition between “architectural elites” and “the general public,” and offers sweeping, dubious claims about how unpopular modernist buildings are compared with those that are classically inspired. It purports to favor local input and local style while imposing a top-down federal mandate.<br />Specifically, the order decrees that “classical architecture shall be the preferred and default architecture for Federal public buildings absent exceptional factors necessitating another kind of architecture.” In addition, it establishes a “President’s Council on Improving Federal Civic Architecture” to draw up a set of rules and procedures to implement the terms of the executive order.<br />As a scholar of Renaissance architecture, I should be delighted by this turn of events. Leon Battista Alberti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Andrea Palladio, architects I teach and admire, are cited approvingly in, of all things, an official government document. And yet, I know how this story ends. It may begin with good intentions. But, as I saw firsthand during the 17 years I spent teaching at the University of Virginia School of Architecture, it ends with talented architects being turned away or hamstrung into defeat by the rigidity of the official stylistic constraints, and with the public being shortchanged.</td>

      <td>With Democrats winning both Senate seats in Georgia, the chamber will have a balance of 50-50, enough for their party to secure control there for the first time in six years. With President-elect Joe Biden set to be inaugurated on Jan. 20, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will then become the tiebreaking vote in the Senate.<br />Here are some questions and answers about the implications of a split Senate.<br />Yes, but not frequently. The last time the chamber was evenly split between the two parties was in 2001. Republican leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota cut a power-sharing deal that divided the committees and their resources evenly. Because Republican Vice President Dick Cheney could still break a tie, Republicans had control.<br />That 50-50 split didn’t last long, though. Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party in June of that year to become an independent and caucus with Democrats. Republicans won the majority back in the 2002 elections.<br />The party in Senate control decides what comes to the floor for a vote. A Democratic majority means that Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), the expected leader, will be able to control what legislation is given priority and what proposals are blocked. It also allows for more coordination with the Democratic-led House and the new Democratic White House.</td>

      <td>The pandemic recession has thrown up roadblocks for most of the nation’s largest banks. Not so for  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.<br />The Wall Street giant’s share price closed at a record for the first time in nearly three years, a sign of how much the bank has profited from the financial chaos of the past year. Its stock has risen about 19% over the past month, far more than any of its five big-bank peers.<br />Goldman shares had been static for years, a perpetual concern for Chief Executive David Solomon and one that led him to peel back some of the bank’s famous secrecy a year ago. At the time, its trading business was languishing amid efforts to build a consumer bank and grow its wealth-management business.<br />The pandemic pushed many of those challenges aside. It spurred roller-coaster markets that lifted its traditional sales-and-trading business. Then, as markets bounced back, its bankers made money helping corporate clients sell debt and equity.<br />The investment-banking business probably stayed strong in the last three months of the year.  Jefferies Financial Group Inc.  said late Monday that its investment-banking revenue hit a record in the fourth quarter, which analysts see as a favorable sign for larger competitors such as Goldman.</td>

      <td>Victory comes hours after Democrat Warnock was declared winner in the Senate race against Republican Loeffler</td>
      <td>ATLANTA—Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff defeated Republican David Perdue for a seat in the U.S. Senate, where he will join fellow newly elected Democrat Raphael Warnock and give their party control of the chamber.<br />The Associated Press declared both men had won their races on Wednesday. The two upset victories give Democrats control of both the Senate and the House for the first time in a decade.<br />Mr. Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, beat Mr. Perdue, who was first elected senator in 2014. Mr. Perdue’s term expired on Sunday. Mr. Warnock, the pastor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s former church, defeated Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the AP projected earlier Wednesday. Ms. Loeffler was appointed a year ago to fill the seat of GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned for health reasons.<br />Messrs. Ossoff and Warnock, who will be sworn in within weeks, will be the first Democrats to represent Georgia in the Senate since 2005. The change of power in the Senate will hand Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration a Congress more willing to consider its agenda. That includes confirming Mr. Biden’s judicial nominees and cabinet appointees to seeking additional federal spending in response to the Covid-19 pandemic—items that were central to Messrs. Ossoff and Warnock’s campaigns.<br />Once the Georgia senators-elect are sworn in, Democrats and Republicans will each hold 50 seats in the Senate. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast tiebreaking votes.</td>

Minutes of the Fed’s Dec. 15-16 policy meeting indicated officials saw a high bar for dialing up that support by increasing the amount or changing the composition of those purchases.<br />“Participants generally judged that the asset purchase program as structured was providing very significant policy accommodation,” according to the minutes, which were released Wednesday.<br />The minutes also indicated that many officials were nervous about the potential for growth to stall in the winter amid a surge in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. But they also thought newly approved vaccines had reduced the chance of worse-than-anticipated economic outcomes later in 2021.<br />“A number of participants saw risks to economic activity as more balanced than earlier,” the minutes said.</td>

On Tuesday, prosecutors painted a much different picture when they explained their decision not to bring charges against Officer Rusten Sheskey, who is white, or Mr. Blake, who is Black.<br />The video shows Mr. Blake in a scuffle with police behind the car, then walking around to the front with officers trailing him, guns drawn. They can be heard ordering him to “drop the knife,” repeatedly, but it isn’t clear in the video whether Mr. Blake is holding a blade.<br />It then shows Mr. Blake opening the driver’s side door, and starting to get into the car, as an officer grabs his tank top and then fires multiple shots toward his back.<br />Prosecutors showed an enhanced video clip at a press briefing on Tuesday in which a dark object can be seen in a few frames in Mr. Blake’s hand. They said the shape matches that of the razorblade type knife found on the floorboards of the car. They also said Mr. Blake admitted to having the knife in his possession and switching it from his left hand to his right so he could open the door.</td>

      <td>Republicans lost one Senate seat in Georgia on Tuesday, and as we write they appear fated to lose a second and control of the Upper Chamber. You don’t have to be Karl Rove to understand what happened.<br />If you want to win, don’t tell voters that their votes don’t matter. Don’t have a President tell his voters that the last election was stolen, that Georgia Republicans were complicit in the theft, that GOP Senate leaders don't care, and then expect those same voters to turn out in the Senate runoffs after a rally and a few tweets.<br />Donald Trump cost Republicans the Senate by making the two Georgia runoffs a referendum on himself. The races should have been a referendum on blocking Democrats from controlling all of Congress and the executive branch. But that message was obscured, if not obliterated, by Mr. Trump’s insistence on telling voters day after day that he was cheated in November—no matter the lack of credible evidence or plausible path to victory.<br />The Georgia election details prove this point. Turnout was down from November as expected in most places. But it was down more in Trump areas than in Democratic strongholds. The suburban voters who rejected Mr. Trump in November also didn’t return to support GOP incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.<br />Neither Republican was a strong candidate, but in November Mr. Perdue beat Democrat Jon Ossoff by some 88,000 votes and nearly avoided a runoff. This time he’s losing by about 17,500. Mr. Ossoff won 54% of suburban Cobb County’s vote against Mr. Perdue in November but 55.8% on Tuesday. In Gwinnett County, also in the Atlanta suburbs, Mr. Ossoff won 56.8% in November but 59.9% this time. Those two counties were GOP strongholds not long ago.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden intends to nominate Merrick Garland as attorney general, selecting a widely respected jurist and experienced prosecutor to steady a Justice Department rocked by years of political storms, people familiar with the matter said.<br />Judge Garland, a 1997 appointee of President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, rose to the top of the list in recent weeks. His selection became definite as Mr. Biden’s team grew increasingly optimistic about Democrats’ chances of taking the two Senate seats in Tuesday’s Georgia’s runoff election, giving them the ability to replace Mr. Garland’s seat on the appeals court without concerns that Republicans would block whomever Mr. Biden chooses.<br />Mr. Biden also intends to nominate longtime national security official Lisa Monaco as deputy attorney general, and Vanita Gupta, who was head of the Justice Department’s civil-rights division under President Barack Obama, as the Department’s No. 3, officials on his transition team said. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, will be named head of the civil-rights division, the transition officials said, in a move that will likely please advocates who have urged Mr. Biden to make diversity and racial justice priorities at the Justice Department.<br />Mr. Garland isn’t close to the Biden family—a fact that transition officials consider an asset given that the Justice Department is investigating the tax and business dealings of Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter. Mr. Garland’s supporters say his decision-making in the case likely would be viewed as independent of the president’s personal interests.<br />A Biden transition official pointed to Mr. Garland’s strong reputation as a judge and his record of being impartial and avoiding any appearances of conflict of interest. The official said Mr. Garland has the “highest level of integrity and independence.”</td>

Six were arrested for organizing and planning the races and 47 for their participation.<br />“This is such a wide net authorities have cast on the pro-democracy camp. Everyone was involved in those primary elections,” said Lee Cheuk-yan, vice chairman of the Labour Party, which had one candidate arrested, Carol Ng. “What road does this lead us down? Who will dare stand for elections again?”<br />The scale of the operation stunned a pro-democracy movement that was already demoralized and expecting further arrests. Officers fanned out across the city starting at around 6 a.m., knocking on doors, confiscating electronics and bringing people into police stations.<br />Among those arrested was an American lawyer in his 70s, John Clancey, who could be seen in a video posted on social media leaning on a cane as he was led to a police van. Others included veteran lawmakers and young political hopefuls who had been aiming to enter the legislature last year for the first time.</td>

Read John Jurgensen’s dive into season 3 of “Cobra Kai” here.<br />Here’s what else is streaming this week:<br />Discovery+, a new subscription streaming service from Discovery, Inc., that launched this week, brings the worlds of Food Network, TLC, HGTV, Animal Planet and other networks and brands, into one universe the way Disney+ consolidated Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel into a single hub at the end of 2019. And much like the way Disney+ has mined franchises like Star Wars for new series like “The Mandalorian,” Discovery+ is digging into some of its most bankable franchises for spin-off series. TLC’s “90 Day Fiancé” for example, already has four spin-offs, including “90 Day Bares All,”“90 Day Diaries,” and “90 Day Journey.”<br />Lisa Holme, a senior vice president at Discovery who leads programming and partnerships for Discovery+, says the service is looking beyond giving its audience more from “Property Brothers,” Bobby Flay, “House Hunters” and Mike Rowe. It also is offering similar content in familiar genres that wouldn’t necessarily air on Discovery’s networks, such as the documentary series “Judi Dench’s Wild Borneo Adventure.” She’s also bullish on the service’s ability to create the next generation of authorities in the food space, authorities in the home space. ”Can we find and create the next Martha Stewart?”</td>

      <td>JOHANNESBURG—A new variant of the coronavirus that is surging across South Africa may make the existing Covid-19 vaccines less effective, but is unlikely to be totally resistant to the shots, according to leading researchers who have studied the mutations and the vaccines.<br />The variant, which has already shown up in patients in Europe and other African countries, has quickly become the predominant one in South Africa, exacerbating a second wave of infections that is overwhelming hospitals and has driven daily deaths to record highs.<br />South African researchers are racing to determine whether it makes patients more seriously ill than other variants of the virus. They are also testing how it responds to antibodies from people who have recovered from Covid-19 and those who have received coronavirus vaccines.<br />Their official conclusions are eagerly awaited by researchers around the globe, since one of the variant’s mutations has in earlier laboratory experiments shown increased resistance to some of the antibodies the body uses to fight off Covid-19. U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier this week that he was “incredibly worried about the South African variant.”<br />But scientists who worked on the antibody experiments and the lead investigators of several vaccine trials being conducted in South Africa say that—based on their understanding of the virus and the immune response triggered by the shots—the immunizations should still work against the new variant, although perhaps not as effectively.</td>

Mr. Trump’s order seeks to ban trading in securities of companies that the administration says have links to the Chinese military.<br />The NYSE said its latest action came after it received “new specific guidance” from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on Tuesday, which listed the three companies’ American depositary receipts as being covered by Mr. Trump’s order.<br />Wednesday’s reversal is likely to raise further questions about the exchange’s handling of the three Chinese stocks. Last week, the NYSE said it would delist the three companies to comply with Mr. Trump’s order, only to reverse course on Monday and say that it wasn’t delisting them.<br />A person familiar with the matter said the NYSE backtracked Monday due to ambiguity in whether the three companies were covered by the order, but the new guidance, which Treasury shared with the exchange late Tuesday, made it clear that the companies must be delisted.

Some bubbles can be hugely destructive, as we saw with housing 13 years ago. Others are socially useful. Private markets generally provide too little incentive for risky innovation because shareholders only capture a small part of an innovation’s benefit; most goes to consumers (think of a life-saving drug). A bubble can overcome that market failure as investors shower capital on countless new ventures they hope will be the next  Microsoft Corp.  or  Amgen Inc.  Even as most of those ventures fail, they extend the technological frontier.<br />In the late 1990s and early 2000s, investors snapped up the stocks and bonds of money-losing technology, media and telecom companies. The mania financed a glut of fiber optic that drove the price of bandwidth down enough to bankrupt many telecom companies while allowing countless new businesses to emerge. It also enabled  Amazon.com Inc.  to raise enough money to keep growing until it had proven its business model could work.</td>

Audits in Arizona’s four most populous counties found no evidence of widespread discrepancies, according to reports released by the Arizona secretary of state’s office.<br />In November, Arizona’s election was the target of claims questioning whether votes made with Sharpie pens would be counted. Government officials debunked the theory. “If you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie),” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, said in a  Facebook  post.<br />Georgia uses voting machines provided by Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems Corp. Mr. Trump said on Twitter after the Nov. 3 vote that Dominion’s equipment is “not good or secure,” and he and his allies have repeatedly questioned the accuracy of those machines.</td>

      <td>Agencies debate impact of ban on U.S. financial markets</td>
      <td>U.S. officials are considering prohibiting Americans from investing in  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  and  Tencent Holdings Ltd. , said people familiar with the matter.<br />In recent weeks, State Department and Department of Defense officials have held conversations on expanding a blacklist of companies that are prohibited to U.S. investments because of claimed ties to China’s military and security services. The U.S. government announced its original blacklist in November with 31 companies.<br />The departments have debated with the Treasury Department over whether adding these firms could have wide capital-markets ramifications, the people said. The plan is still under deliberation and may not go through as agencies debate its impact on markets, the people added.<br />Tencent and Alibaba are China’s two most-valuable publicly listed companies with a combined market capitalization of over $1.3 trillion, and their shares are held by scores of U.S. mutual funds and other investors. If enacted, the move would be a major escalation by the exiting Trump administration on its efforts to unwind U.S. investors’ holdings in major Chinese companies.<br />The Trump administration has stepped up efforts to sanction Chinese companies in its final days. On Wednesday, the New York Stock Exchange said it will move ahead to delist China’s three biggest telecommunication carriers, backtracking an earlier decision to scrap the plan after receiving “new specific guidance” from the Treasury Department.</td>

      <td>New rule makes it easier to classify workers as independent contractors, a win for Uber, Lyft, DoorDash</td>
      <td>The Trump administration made it easier for businesses to classify workers as independent contractors, a victory for gig-economy companies such as food-delivery and ride-sharing services and a counter to a California law that did the opposite.<br />The Labor Department in a final rule released on Wednesday would make it more difficult for a gig worker, such as an Uber or  DoorDash  driver, to be counted as an employee under federal law. That means those workers wouldn’t be covered by federal minimum-wage and overtime laws, and they could be responsible for paying the employer portion of Social Security taxes.<br />The rule won’t go into effect until March 8, after President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. The Biden administration could seek to delay implementing the rule, give new enforcement guidance or seek to write a new version of the rule. The Biden administration could also opt to not defend the regulation should it be challenged in court. A spokeswoman for Mr. Biden declined to comment.<br />Flexible work is overwhelmingly preferred by those who choose to earn on gig-economy platforms such as Uber, Danielle Burr,  Uber Technologies Inc.’s  head of federal affairs, said Wednesday.<br />“Forcing a binary choice upon workers—to either be an employee with more benefits but with less flexibility, or an independent contractor with limited protections—is outdated,” she said, noting Uber has offered additional benefits to drivers. “We appreciate the efforts made to modernize our nation’s laws.”</td>

      <td>Trial lawyers are eager to sue businesses for scanning foreheads and letting older employees work from home.</td>
      <td>Businesses are doing all they can to keep operating while minimizing the spread of the virus. But some have run into an unexpected obstacle: federal law.<br />In May, as the first wave of the pandemic receded, Connecticut put out guidelines for workplace reopening. “Individuals over the age of 65 or with other health conditions should not visit offices, but instead continue to stay home and stay safe.” That seemed like a sound directive, but as lawyers soon pointed out, the state had told its private employers to violate federal law. The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act makes it unlawful to deprive older employees of any opportunity offered to younger colleagues.<br />You might think being assigned to work from home at full salary doesn’t count as being deprived of an opportunity, but trial lawyers have been known to argue otherwise. An at-home employee might have fewer promotion opportunities or benefit from less mentoring. Someone could try for a class action.<br />That isn’t an isolated example. For some employers a reopening plan might include using antibody tests to identify which employees had Covid and recovered; given likely immunity, those persons could be a good bet for jobs where personal contact is unavoidable. But June guidelines from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission count antibody testing as a breach of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The commission says tests for current infection are OK.<br />What about vaccination before coming back to work? The EEOC recently said it thinks employers are free to require Covid vaccination in most situations. But some employees will demand to be excused under religious or disability accommodation, and that can get chancy and expensive. In 2018 the EEOC extracted a $75,000 settlement from a Tennessee hospital that had refused to grant an employee a religious exception from its mandatory flu shot policy.</td>

      <td>Huawei is no longer set to dominate telecom networks.</td>
      <td>One of the Trump administration’s major foreign policy initiatives has gone largely unnoticed. You probably heard that the president left the Paris climate accords and Iran nuclear deal, launched a trade war, ordered the killing of Iran’s Gen. Qassem Solemaini, moved a U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and presided over peace agreements between Israel and several former Arab enemies. But you may have missed the Clean Network initiative.<br />In early 2020, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged friends and allies not to include any high-risk (read: Chinese) vendors in their 5G networks. Many countries, including the U.K., had already decided to use Huawei over rivals  Ericsson  and  Nokia .  In February, senior Huawei executive Ryan Ding announced that the company had secured 91 5G commercial contracts, 47 of them in Europe. The Clean Network plan seemed doomed to fail.<br />Then Covid-19 struck. The Chinese obfuscated the virus’s origins and attempted to sow division in the West by supplying personal protective equipment to some but not to others. Western governments began to see Beijing in a different light.<br />Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, began pleading with friendly countries to ditch their Chinese plans. He found allies among congressional Democrats. “Nations cannot cede our telecommunication infrastructure to China for financial expediency,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi told a conference in February. A couple of weeks later, a bipartisan group of senators led by Chuck Schumer and Ben Sasse urged the U.K. to reverse its 5G decision.<br />At the end of 2020, the global 5G situation looked radically different than it had at the start of the year. Britain had reversed course, banning Huawei from its 5G network. The Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Sweden all opted not to use Chinese suppliers. The Italian government, long a top target of Chinese charm offensives, had banned a top telecom firm from using Huawei. And last month Germany, often considered soft on China, passed a law that allows the government to block telecom firms’ deals with Huawei on national security grounds. Global telecom firms from  AT&T  to  Telefónica  have joined Clean Network too, vowing not to use Chinese components.</td>

The deal calls for AmerisourceBergen to pay about $6.3 billion in cash for the assets and two million of its shares, the companies said Wednesday.<br />Walgreens said the sale would allow it to better concentrate on pharmacies in its stores and on expanding health offerings. Last year, the company said it struck a deal to invest in and work with VillageMD to open hundreds of clinics with primary-care doctors at Walgreens sites across the U.S. over the next five years.<br />CVS has also pushed to bulk up its health-care services, buying insurer Aetna and developing health hubs for its stores. The company doesn’t have a wholesale operation but instead focuses on managing pharmacy benefits, running retail stores and providing health insurance.<br />Both chains are seeking to give patients more reasons to visit their locations as Amazon pushes into the prescription-drug business.

Students of politics had an easy explanation: Republicans favor Wall Street, while Silicon Valley is a progressive bastion.<br />Easy, but wrong, as the Georgia Senate vote showed. The investor response to the Georgia vote (yet to be final, but interpreted by prediction markets as a sure thing for the Democrats) was to buy banks and sell Big Tech.<br />Sure, politics has shifted, and  Facebook  and  Amazon  are now treated as baddies by many on the left. The possibility of higher capital-gains taxes should hit stocks that have left investors sitting on fat unrealized profits, too.</td>

      <td>Hesitancy on the part of long-term-care-facility staffers to receive Covid-19 vaccinations is slowing the rollout of the shots to the nation’s nursing homes and assisted-living centers,  CVS Health Corp.  said Wednesday.<br />Another factor driving lower-than-anticipated rollout numbers: Initial estimates by the facilities overstated the number of people living in them by about 20% to 30%, CVS said. During the pandemic, families have been reluctant to send relatives to nursing homes, which have been linked to more than 115,000 deaths.<br />“Based on feedback from our field teams, we’ve encountered more vaccine hesitancy among staff when compared with residents,” a CVS spokesman said. Facilities are also staggering dosing to staff because of potential side effects, which has extended the process.<br />The pharmacy giant said it is still on track to reach federal goals to deliver first doses at about 8,000 skilled-nursing facilities by Jan. 25.  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  said Wednesday that it also expects to complete the administration of the first doses in skilled-nursing facilities by Jan. 25.<br />CVS and Walgreens said they are also preparing to provide vaccinations to the general public by appointment at their drugstores once they become available for mass distribution later this year. Currently CVS and Walgreens are only authorized to administer vaccines at long-term-care facilities under a federal contract.</td>

      <td>Johnny Lawrence was supposed to be left in the 1980s with a kick to the face at the end of “The Karate Kid.” Instead, the movie’s former teen villain is one of the biggest things on television at the center of “Cobra Kai,” a streaming series that carries on the “Karate Kid” tale with a mix of satire and sincerity.<br />“Cobra Kai” vaulted to No. 1 on  Netflix ’s  internal Top 10 chart with the Jan. 1 release of its third season. After “Cobra Kai” first hit Netflix last August, it spent two weeks as the most-watched TV series on major streaming platforms, and spent five weeks total in the top 10, according to Nielsen. Sony Pictures Television, which produces the show, says “Cobra Kai” draws a balance of young and older viewers that is rare among today’s diffuse TV audiences.<br />Johnny is an unlikely character to unite the masses in 2021. The fictional beer-swilling sensei is clueless about computers and social media. He’s more interested in Ratt and other ancient rock bands than the shifting social norms that rendered much of his vocabulary obsolete, including an offensive word for coward. The p-word is Johnny’s go-to descriptor for wimpy trainees, light beer, and even the unresponsive legs of a star pupil who got paralyzed in a high-school “karate riot.”<br />“People get to live vicariously through Johnny’s ignorance of the times. That’s what’s endearing about him,” says William Zabka, the actor who played Johnny in “Karate Kid” at age 18, and again at age 55 in “Cobra Kai.” “He’s never heard the term ‘cancel culture’ in his life. He’s not informed about what you can say, what you can’t say. He’s an artifact of the ‘80s.”<br />In the quest to launch TV hits with cross-generational appeal, producers are retrofitting vintage Hollywood stories with contemporary context. In the works: “Bel-Air,” a dramatic take on the sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” for the Black Lives Matter era. A new continuation of “Saved by the Bell,” the comedic high-school soap opera from the ‘90s, has gotten strong reviews on Peacock for popping the bubble of privilege its characters once existed in.</td>

It is among the FAA’s busiest air-traffic control centers, located in Ronkonkoma, N.Y.<br />The message likely was able to be transmitted, one person said, because the air-traffic control system is accessible by some portable scanners available to consumers, aviation buffs and pilots.<br />CBS News, which first reported the threat, played a recording of an apparently computer-generated voice saying: “We are flying a plane into the Capitol Wednesday.” The message indicated the motivation was to avenge the U.S. government’s 2020 assassination of a prominent Iranian military leader, Gen. Qassem Soleimani.<br />Lawmakers were set to gather on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday for a joint session of Congress to ratify the electoral win of President-elect Joe Biden.</td>

      <td>Leaders of some large companies say they may withhold political donations and investments in states whose lawmakers are challenging Electoral College results</td>
      <td>In a virtual gathering of chief executives convened to discuss political turbulence stemming from the 2020 election, leaders of some of the largest U.S. companies said they were considering withholding donations to Republican lawmakers seeking to impede the presidential transition.<br />During an hourlong meeting Tuesday, a group of about three dozen chief executives discussed divisions in the country, efforts to thwart the presidential transition and what voice they thought business should have in politics, according to people who participated in the conversation. Some business leaders who have donated to Republican campaigns stated that they were considering withholding future political contributions to elected officials who have said they would oppose certifying the Electoral College results for President-elect Joe Biden, those people said.<br />Among business leaders on the call were Walt Disney Co. Executive Chairman Robert Iger, a noted Democrat who has indicated interest in an ambassador role under the Biden administration; Accenture PLC Chief Executive Officer Julie Sweet, a Republican who has donated to Sen. Ted Cruz; and Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier, who publicly broke with President Trump in 2017, but has donated to candidates from both parties, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The gathering included about a dozen advisers, such as former Obama administration Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Anthony Scaramucci, who served briefly in the Trump administration but has more recently been a critic of the president.<br />The gathering, along with a letter sent by nearly 200 CEOs on Monday urging Congress to accept the election results, marks a shift in tactics for business leaders, some of whom are joining forces to take newly strident positions on politics rather than speaking out individually. Other business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, have also issued statements this week calling for a smooth transition of power.<br />Also in the meeting, people familiar with the gathering said, were Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Senior Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, a Democrat, and Deloitte CEO Joseph Ucuzoglu, who doesn’t disclose his political affiliation, both of whom donated to Republicans in recent years. The discussion began with a conversation about political instability in the country, the people said.</td>

This dish, however, she discovered closer to home. “I always ate a chicken souvlaki sandwich at this Greek restaurant outside of town,” she said. It stuck with her.<br />But as her first Slow Food Fast recipe reveals, Ms. Nalic didn’t stick to that version. Her travels taught her how to freshen up the street-food standby with herbs, lemon, garlic and a great yogurt sauce.<br />It starts with marinating diced chicken thigh meat with oregano, parsley and lemon zest. While those aromatics go to work on the chicken, you can make the tzatziki, a cucumber-yogurt sauce that packs a bracing garlic punch. When it’s time to cook the meat, feel free to grill, broil or pan-sear—whatever you have to do to get a good char.<br />Nestled into warm pita (or whatever flatbread you prefer), drizzled with tzatziki, that smoky chicken becomes a satisfying meal.

      <td>Market reaction to Georgia runoff shows that partisan division in Washington is no longer good for stocks</td>
      <td>The old cliché that investors prefer divided government is in need of an update.<br />After Democrats won one Georgia Senate seat and appeared poised to take another Wednesday morning, which would deliver them control of the Senate, market reaction was mostly positive. This goes against the conventional wisdom that stocks do best when at least one chamber of Congress is controlled by the party in opposition to the president, preventing any dramatic or radical moves that could unsettle markets.<br />Although Nasdaq futures were lower Wednesday morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was poised to build on Tuesday’s gains. Perhaps most notably, yields on U.S. government bonds jumped, reflecting higher growth expectations and giving a boost to banks and other financial companies.<br />In light of recent history, this reaction shouldn’t be surprising. In past decades, divided government might have meant moderation and compromise in policy-making. In 2021, though, it would likely mean paralysis, which isn’t what the U.S. economy needs right now. Look no further than the prolonged negotiations over a second coronavirus-relief package, which eventually yielded a smaller-than-expected sum that came too late to save many struggling businesses as the economy entered a bleak winter.<br />A Democratic-controlled Senate likely means that more fiscal stimulus is on the way, not just in the form of checks to individuals but also infrastructure spending and aid to cash-strapped local governments. No wonder interest rates are ticking higher.</td>

      <td>We can’t know the one thing we all want to know about travel in 2021: When can we confidently start traveling again safely? As we’ve seen lately, uncertainty continues with developments like the new variant of Covid-19 and slower vaccine distribution. But there’s a lot we can know about travel in the new year. Here are some predictions:<br />Airlines will respond to increases in demand for seats with higher prices much faster than they can get more flights into schedules. There’s tons of pent-up demand, and when it spills out into bookings, prices in some markets will surge.<br />Hotels in prime destinations will seem maddeningly expensive. Downtown luxury business hotels will stay especially cheap, since their core business travelers won’t be coming back in droves yet.<br />Airline pricing right now often follows our own hopes and expectations. I tracked tickets for the same dates each month in 2021 in five markets and found that tickets are really cheap early in the year—when there likely will be little travel—and more expensive for summer bookings, when airlines anticipate healthy demand.<br />Between New York and Los Angeles, for example,  JetBlue  had round trips for $211 in on the dates I checked (departing the 23rd of each month and returning on the 28th) in February, March and April. May jumped to $386—a more normal fare for advance bookings.</td>

      <td>The European Union’s main drug regulator on Wednesday cleared  Moderna Inc.’s  Covid-19 vaccine for use, offering the region a second shot to fight the coronavirus at a time when it is already struggling to distribute the doses it has.<br />The decision, which is expected to be formalized by the European Commission within 24 hours, comes more than two weeks after Moderna’s shot received emergency-use authorization in the U.S. and U.K., a timeline that shows how the EU’s regulators have struggled to assess vaccines as quickly as their Western counterparts.<br />The agency said the vaccine should be administered in two doses, the second 28 days after the first, as intended by the manufacturer. The recommendation comes after public-health institutions elsewhere have explored the possibility of delaying second doses so that more people can receive their first.<br />“This vaccine provides us with another tool to overcome the current emergency,” said Emer Cooke, executive director of the European Medicines Agency. “It is a testament to the efforts and commitment of all involved that we have this second positive vaccine recommendation just short of a year since the pandemic was declared.”<br />Since Dec. 27, the EU has been offering its first authorized vaccine, developed by  BioNTech SE  and  Pfizer Inc.,  to nursing-home residents and health-care workers. But the rollout has been slowed by logistical bottlenecks, wasted doses, the challenges of bringing temperature-sensitive vaccines to distant facilities, and reluctance by even some hospital staff to receive a novel vaccine against a disease many of them have already contracted.</td>

Mr. Ho said he understood the arrest was due to Mr. Clancey’s involvement in a political group active in last year’s pro-democratic election primaries, events which are at the center of the investigation.<br />Mr. Clancey couldn’t be reached for comment. People who know him said he was a decadeslong Hong Kong resident, fluent in the city’s local language of Cantonese and active in a number of groups and causes advocating for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong, mainland China and the region.<br />In a video posted to social media by a local news outlet, Mr. Clancey could be seen walking with a cane from his office to a police van and surrounded by reporters. “Continue to work for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong,” he said when asked if he had a message for the people of Hong Kong.<br />“He’s certainly one of the most peaceful and reasonable persons that you’re ever going to meet,” said Mark Daly, a Hong Kong lawyer who has worked on human-rights issues with Mr. Clancey. “It certainly is a concern with this national security law that possibly even promoting democracy and human rights may be considered an offense.”</td>

The company, along with local authorities, says vandals showing support for a protest that has blocked the roads into New Delhi for more than a month are responsible for damaging the cell towers.<br />Reliance controls India’s biggest cellular company and its largest retailer, including some of the country’s largest grocery-store chains. Those chains are expected to benefit from a new law that deregulates the farming industry to allow more private-sector control of distribution. Mr. Ambani, worth around $75 billion according to Forbes magazine, is seen as close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is backing the new law. He is one of the most influential corporate leaders in New Delhi.<br />The state of Punjab said on Tuesday that it had deployed more than 1,000 people to protect Reliance assets across the state. The company had petitioned courts this week in Punjab and the state of Haryana, where it has more than 20 million cellular customers, for more protection for its retail stores and towers for its Jio telephone network.<br />Reliance has “sought the urgent intervention of government authorities to bring a complete stop to the illegal acts of vandalism by miscreants,” it said on Monday, without specifying exactly what actions it expected authorities to take. “These acts of violence have endangered the lives of thousands of its employees and caused damage and disruption to the vital communications infrastructure.”</td>

Should you accept government money, and the strings attached with it, to try to catch up?<br />Scenarios like that are already being studied by first-year M.B.A. students at Harvard University and other business schools around the country. The courses are aimed at analyzing management decisions—good and bad—made during the pandemic and gleaning what lessons can be taught, given the benefit of hindsight.<br />“My aspiration was to give them, as future leaders, a way to judge these things. How do I ask the right questions? How do I make a reasoned judgment?” Harvard Business School professor Willy Shih said about this pharmaceutical case study used in his fall course, which also exposed students to the inner workings of the life-sciences industry.<br />His technology and operations-management class—which was taught online and in person on the school’s Boston campus—considered how the company could offset the costs of clinical trials and ramping up manufacturing by accepting funding from Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government’s coronavirus vaccine program. But the M.B.A. candidates also had to weigh whether the company would want the requirements that come attached to such funding, including allowing the government to control how the vaccine is priced.<br />After more than an hour of debate, most students agreed that the drugmaker should forgo government funding, Mr. Shih said. Many advocated the company stick to private development, saying it was better for the long-term health of its vaccine business that it doesn’t rely on government help.</td>

Turkey’s benchmark stock index, the Borsa Istanbul 100, is up more than 10% over the past month and more than 70% from its low last year.<br />This has pushed the lira to its strongest level against the dollar since Aug. 19, with one dollar buying 7.3342 lira as of Wednesday.<br />Investors have piled into emerging markets broadly, expecting that the economies hardest hit by Covid-19—and that have seen less fiscal support than other nations—will have a strong bounceback due to the global vaccine rollout. A recent bout of dollar weakness is also expected to boost demand for exports of dollar-priced commodities including oil, giving more support to economic rebounds in emerging markets.</td>

The three have said Mr. Biden won the election on Nov. 3 and are expected to vote to ratify his 306-232 Electoral College victory on Wednesday.<br />Mr. Trump planned to address loyalists gathered in the city on Wednesday morning for rallies.

      <td>Surging ethereum prices may drive demand for mining gear with the latest gaming chips</td>
      <td>The good news is that  Nvidia  won’t have any problem selling its new gaming chips. The bad news might be who exactly gets their hands on them.<br />The recent surge in cryptocurrency prices is likely boosting demand for Nvidia’s graphics processors. Those chips are designed for videogaming, but are also used to “mine” cryptocurrencies such as ethereum. This process, which involves matching and updating cryptocurrency transactions in return for rewards, gets more profitable the higher prices get. And with ethereum prices now back above the $1,000 mark—and having nearly doubled since Christmas—crypto-driven demand is likely to affect Nvidia’s sales for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends this month. Mitch Steves of RBC Capital said in a report Tuesday that ethereum above $1,000 spells “robust” demand for high-end graphics chips.<br />Just how much of an impact remains to be seen. Jon Peddie, whose eponymous firm tracks the market for graphics chips and related add-in boards, wrote in a report last month that the latest boards with expanded memory banks from both Nvidia and  Advanced Micro Devices  are “extremely attractive to miners.” And Nvidia’s newest chips have been hot property since going on sale in September. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told a  UBS  conference last month that the company has seen “overwhelming demand” and still faces some supply challenges. Wall Street is projecting a surge of 58% in Nvidia’s gaming revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter. That would be the segment’s biggest jump in three years, when the last crypto bubble inflated demand for its chips in early 2018.<br />Nvidia will no doubt try to better gauge the impact this time around. Ms. Kress said at the conference that the company has “spent some quality time” to improve its understanding of its sales channels. Lack of clarity really hurt the company during the last crypto bubble when soaring revenue growth came to an abrupt halt as crypto-miners started dumping their boards on the secondary market after ethereum prices plunged, hurting sales of new chips. Nvidia’s share price fell 31% that year following an 81% jump the year before.<br />But Nvidia’s stock price has just seen an even stronger run, more than doubling in value over the past 12 months. And the crypto effect will most certainly be temporary even if prices remain elevated, as coming changes to the ethereum network will diminish the need for graphics processors. Mr. Steves of RBC expects those changes to take effect later this year or early next year, which will likely result in miners trying to sell off their chips at that point. Nvidia’s best hope may be that gamers keep the miners from getting their hands on too many of them.</td>

Exhibit A is Beijing’s decision to bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and impose new national-security legislation on the city on July 1 to stamp out a yearlong protest movement.<br />Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed government moved quickly to make use of those powers to pacify the city, arresting protesters, ejecting four pro-democracy lawmakers from the city’s legislature and rounding up opposition figures. Most recently, 53 were arrested in a series of dawn raids on Jan. 6 over allegations of plotting to subvert the city’s government.<br />The U.S. has taken steps to punish Beijing by restricting visas for Chinese officials and declaring that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to merit special treatment on trade in goods such as defense technologies. It also imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials and Hong Kong governing figures including Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Here’s how we got to this point.<br />Around 1,000 police officers arrested 53 pro-democracy figures in a high-profile operation that involved searching 72 locations across the city on Jan. 6. It was the biggest swoop since the law was imposed.<br />The allegations center on unofficial primaries held by opposition groups in July for the public to choose the most popular candidates for legislative elections planned for September. More than 600,000 people voted. The pro-democracy camp sought to win more than half of the 70 seats in the city’s legislature and said it would use a majority to block government policy. Many candidates were subsequently disqualified, and officials then postponed the poll for a year, citing the coronavirus situation.</td>

      <td>Serum Institute to manufacture vaccines not just for the world’s second-most populous country, but likely many others too</td>
      <td>India has authorized two Covid-19 vaccines for use, putting its enormous vaccine-manufacturing capacity in the spotlight. Large parts of the rich world may have something valuable to learn.<br />The Serum Institute of India is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, founded over 50 years ago by now-multibillionaire Cyrus Poonawalla. It will likely provide not only almost all the vaccines administered in India, but many elsewhere in the world too, once exports are permitted later in the year.<br />Research by Fitch Solutions outlines three groups of Asian economies this year: Those that can plausibly vaccinate most of the people in priority groups such as health-care workers and the elderly by June, those that can do so by September and those that will take longer. India is by some distance the lowest-income country in the first group of economies, which includes Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Malaysia. Wealthier South Korea and Thailand will take longer.<br />The Serum Institute’s work requires a reliable and large domestic supply of the vials in which the vaccines are sealed and transported, ensured by companies such as Schott Kaisha and Piramal Glass. The existence of the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer helps to establish the basis for a domestic network of suppliers.<br />Global supply chains and international trade have actually held up remarkably well under extreme circumstances over the past year. There is no need to reshore enormous amounts of manufacturing capacity, and any attempt at even halfway autarky will make all parties involved—importers and exporters—less prosperous.</td>

It plans to have at least 5,000 employees in each region within five years.<br />The bulk of its investment will be through low-cost loans to preserve or build affordable housing, Amazon said. The company also will offer grants to public agencies and minority-led housing organizations.<br />“We don’t have control over how the [housing] markets respond to a large employer coming into the market or expanding in the market, but we can play a role in how Amazon’s growth is impacting our local communities,” said Catherine Buell, head of community development for one of Amazon’s philanthropic arms. “Particularly as we’re expanding our corporate presence, we’re working to get ahead of the issue as much as we can.”</td>

But while team members were en route, Tuesday, the WHO was told that Chinese officials had not yet finalized the necessary permissions for their arrival, Dr. Tedros said.<br />Some members were still waiting for visas, said Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies program, and at least one member has begun returning home.<br />“I am very disappointed in this news,” said Dr. Tedros. “I have once again made it clear that the mission is a priority for WHO and the international team. I have been assured that China is speeding up the internal procedure.”<br />“We are eager to get the mission under way as soon as possible,” he added.</td>

      <td>Blockbuster rally of U.S. tech companies is regarded by money managers as hard to replicate in year ahead</td>
      <td>Investors betting on a continued economic rebound are increasingly looking beyond U.S. stocks.<br />Many money managers are focusing on emerging markets, which they expect to outperform as the global economy accelerates in the wake of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Some are also taking a look at European markets, which lagged behind in 2020 but are dominated by cyclical shares.<br />Investing in U.S. stocks, they say, has increasingly become a concentrated bet on the technology sector, which contributed more than half of the S&P 500’s 18% total return last year. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite fared even better, rising 45% including dividends. Those gains might be difficult to replicate in the new year.<br />“We feel like the opportunity from here going forward is really going to be in the international markets outside of the U.S.,” said Munish Malhotra, co-portfolio manager of global equity strategy at Cambiar Investors. Potential easing of Washington’s trade tensions with China could reduce a headwind, while in the U.S., big technology companies might face challenges trying to extend their rapid growth, he said.<br />Cambiar recently added to positions in the German engineering giant  Siemens AG  and the Macau casino operator  Sands China Ltd. , betting that both will benefit as the pandemic subsides.</td>

      <td>Covid-19 was easier on the car industry than initially expected, but might pose long-term challenges</td>
      <td>So far, the car industry has emerged from the pandemic with just a few dents. The longer-term impact could be uglier.<br />A total of 14.5 million passenger vehicles—a category spanning cars, sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks—were sold in the U.S. last year, according to Wards Intelligence. That is roughly 15% lower than in 2019, but much better than seemed possible when the first bout of Covid-19 cases prompted widespread dealership closures in the spring. Fourth-quarter sales were only 2% below their level in the same period of 2019.<br />While the fear of catching Covid-19 kept some people away from lots, much of the expected pain for the car industry was cushioned by a sudden preference for private over public transportation, allied with strong household spending on durable goods. U.S. vehicle routing requests on  Apple  maps collapsed in March, but recovered by late May, even as transit routing requests remained 60% below their January level. That helps explain why some of the money that didn’t go toward restaurants or holidays made its way into new and secondhand vehicles at surprisingly high prices.<br />These buoyant conditions will likely linger into the new year, given the fresh wave of infections, a second round of stimulus checks and rock-bottom interest rates. At some point, though, they will fade. As vaccines are rolled out and some aspects of life normalize, consumers should start to spend more money on flights and social activities again. Moreover, potentially stickier changes to the pre-Covid norm, such as remote working, might not be great for car sales further down the road.<br />Before the pandemic, almost 40% of the miles traveled by passenger vehicle in the U.S. were for commuting or shopping, according to data collated by KPMG. At least a chunk of that seems likely to disappear as people work at home more and order more products online. Demand for vehicles should follow. KPMG said more U.S. families might get by with one car in the future, potentially reducing the average number of vehicles per household to 1.87, from the pre-Covid level of 1.97.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—In a series of dawn raids Wednesday, police swept up dozens of Hong Kong’s most prominent opposition figures, some of whom said they were accused of subversion under a national security law imposed by Beijing last year.<br />From about 6 a.m., police started making arrests at the homes of the politicians, according to social-media accounts of some detained. The arrests were related to their participation in unofficial election primaries held last year by the democratic camp ahead of planned legislative elections, they said.<br />The police operation is the biggest since the sweeping national security law was imposed six months ago, and activists said the arrests were the first related to alleged subversion, a serious crime under that law. The range and profile of the people arrested, comprising most of Hong Kong’s opposition, marks a dramatic escalation in authorities’ efforts to crush dissent in the city, which was racked by months of antigovernment street protests in 2019.<br />Less than two weeks after the security law was imposed, on the weekend of July 11 and 12, the opposition camp took part in self-organized primaries to select preferred candidates for elections scheduled for September. The aim was to improve chances of gaining a majority in the legislature, which participants said would allow them to block government legislation. Organizers said then that about 600,000 members of the public cast their votes.<br />Many of the politicians were told weeks later that their candidacies were invalid, with authorities citing concerns over their loyalty to the city and its constitution. Shortly after the disqualifications, the government postponed the elections by a year, citing the coronavirus pandemic.</td>

His bonus had taken a 36% hit in 2019 when his pay package fell as revenue and profit declined tied to weaker iPhone sales.<br />In the past fiscal year, despite a global pandemic that disrupted economies around the world, Apple’s profit rose 3.9% with laptops and iPads sales benefiting from workers and students stuck at home as part of efforts to slow the spread of Covid-19. Apple’s share price rose more than 80% in 2020, placing its market value at more than $2 trillion.<br />In addition to his compensation, Mr. Cook had a total of $281.9 million in restricted stock that vested during the year. Those shares were a core part of Mr. Cook’s long-term incentive package that was awarded in 2011 when he became CEO. The decadelong plan’s final tranche vests later this year.<br />In September, Apple’s board awarded a new long-term equity plan to Mr. Cook with shares that vest from 2023 through 2025, giving him incentive to stay on as CEO through that period. Mr. Cook, 60 years old, joined Apple in 1998.</td>

Smith has accumulated 20 receiving touchdowns and 1,641 yards so far and will have a chance to add to his totals during the championship game against No. 3 Ohio State on Jan. 11 in Miami Gardens, Fla.<br />The Alabama senior took home 447 first-place votes, beating out a trio of quarterbacks: teammate Mac Jones, Trevor Lawrence of Clemson and Kyle Trask of Florida.<br />Smith is the third skill player from Alabama to win the Heisman Trophy in the last 12 years, a testament to the program’s rich history of recruiting. Although Smith played in 2019 for the Crimson Tide, he was buried on the depth chart behind Jerry Jeudy and Henry Ruggs III, both of whom earned starting spots on NFL rosters after being taken 12th and 15th, respectively, in the 2020 NFL draft.<br />“When you got here everybody was on the same mission to become the best player they could be,” Smith said on Tuesday night. “Being around those guys they taught me so much.”</td>

      <td>The Grammy Awards ceremony has been postponed for two months, as concerns surge over the spread of Covid-19, according to the Recording Academy, which hosts the annual music-industry awards show.<br />The ceremony was originally set to take place on Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, with “The Daily Show” host and comedian Trevor Noah as host. Grammy organizers have pushed the event to March 14. The academy’s website earlier Tuesday showed the date had been pushed back to March 21.<br />In late November, the Recording Academy’s interim chief executive and president, Harvey Mason Jr., said there would be live performances at this year’s show but that—given the pandemic—there would be a limited in-person audience, if any audience at all. He also said the Grammys was working with medical experts to ensure artists and fans were safe. “I can definitely tell you there won’t be 17,000 fans there,” he said.<br />But since then, the U.S.—and California and Los Angeles County in particular—has seen a surge in coronavirus cases that gathered strength after Thanksgiving and the December holidays. On Monday, the U.S. reported 180,477 new infections, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. While the figure was down from a day earlier as holiday reporting lags continue to affect data, the seven-day average of new cases—which helps smooth out irregularities in data reporting—has risen above 200,000 again. California is the hardest hit U.S. state, with more than 2.45 million cases, according to Johns Hopkins.<br />“The deteriorating Covid situation in Los Angeles, with hospital services being overwhelmed, ICUs having reached capacity, and new guidance from state and local governments have all led us to conclude that postponing our show was the right thing to do,” the Recording Academy said in a joint statement with CBS, which is broadcasting the event. “Nothing is more important than the health and safety of those in our music community and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly on producing the show.”</td>

      <td>The New York Stock Exchange is in the hot seat after a baffling flip-flop in which it first said it would delist three Chinese companies to comply with an executive order from President Trump, only to reverse itself four days later.<br />The NYSE’s U-turn drew criticism from the administration of President Trump, who signed the order in November ordering a ban on the trading of securities of companies U.S. officials say have links to the Chinese military.<br />The order was one of the last salvos by Mr. Trump to get tough on Beijing and put the NYSE in a difficult situation since the exchange has long welcomed initial public offerings of companies from China.<br />While on a trip to Egypt, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called NYSE President Stacey Cunningham to object to the exchange operator’s reversal, a Trump administration official said. Mr. Mnuchin supports NYSE’s original plan to delist the companies, this official added.<br />News of his call to Ms. Cunningham was earlier reported by Bloomberg News. A spokesman for the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., declined to comment on the call from Mr. Mnuchin.</td>

      <td>Recent history may explain the behavior of Republican voters.</td>
      <td>Why do so many Donald Trump voters believe his claim that he won the fall election, despite states declaring that he didn’t and numerous judges rejecting his lawsuits? Perhaps it’s because some Trump conspiracy theories about the nation’s political establishment turned out to be true. The Obama administration really did spy on Mr. Trump’s campaign and media outlets really have been out to get him. Therefore many Trump voters resist acknowledging the duly certified victory of Joe Biden, our President-elect.<br />Thiel Capital’s Eric Weinstein writes on Twitter that almost everyone he knows sees either “two conspiracies against Trump or zero.” He adds:<br />In a separate tweet, Mr. Weinstein writes about the media:<br />Speaking of the media, Mark Finkelstein at NewsBusters writes:<br />CNN’s Fareed Zakaria recently acknowledged “the dirty little secret” that the Trump administration “was pretty tough on the Russians. They armed Ukraine, they armed the Poles. They extended NATO operations and exercises in ways that even the Obama Administration had not done. They maintained the sanctions.”</td>
