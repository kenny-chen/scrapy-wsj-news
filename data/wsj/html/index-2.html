      <td>The 78th Golden Globe awards will be hosted by bicoastal hosts Amy Poehler and Tina Fey with no shortage of star-studded moments</td>
      <td>The 78th Golden Globes will kick off a very socially distanced 2021 awards season. While award ceremonies have taken on a different look during the pandemic, leaving more room for the unpredictable, there are still some things we can be certain of for the big night this Sunday.<br />The Golden Globes will be airing on Sunday, Feb. 28 and begin at 8 p.m. ET. The awards ceremony usually lasts about three hours.<br />The event will be broadcast on NBC and available through the network’s website with a television-provider login. The event will also be available to stream on the Roku Channel, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV, Sling TV and Fubo TV. If you don’t have access to these platforms, many are offering free trials. If you miss the ceremony on Sunday, the event will also be available to watch Monday on NBC’s Peacock service.<br />With more people spending more time at home and movie theaters closed over the last year, there has been no shortage of breakthrough television and films to stream. As a result,  Netflix  is looking at an impressive 42 nominations this year, including Aaron Sorkin’s courtroom drama “The Trial of the Chicago 7.” Another favorite from streaming giant Hulu up for four nominations is Chloé Zhao‘s “Nomadland.” Among the five nominees for best director, three are women including Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) and Regina King (“One Night in Miami”), along with director Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”).<br />Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will be hosting the Golden Globes for the fourth time. However, they will be on different coasts, with Ms. Fey presenting from the Rainbow Room in New York and Ms. Poehler from Beverly Hills, Calif. Guests, nominees and award winners will also be broadcasting live from their respective locations. The comedic duo follows Ricky Gervais, who hosted his fifth Golden Globe awards last year.</td>

      <td>The ceremony is largely virtual this year, but that’s not all you need to know about Hollywood’s rowdiest awards show</td>
      <td>It’s high drama at the Golden Globes this year.<br />The awards show that is supposed to be a little raucous—the frat party on the way to the Oscars—already had a reputation for contentious wins and snubs. But going into Sunday night’s ceremony, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, whose small membership votes on the awards, is facing more serious questions about the diversity of its ranks and the ethics of its prizes.<br />As if all that weren’t challenging enough, the largely virtual telecast must draw viewers without its usual ballroom of movie stars, all during a pandemic, which even on a good day doesn’t leave many people in the mood to pop champagne. The NBC show, co-hosted by Amy Poehler in Beverly Hills and Tina Fey in New York, airs at 8 p.m. Eastern/5 p.m. Pacific.<br />In an alternate universe, the Globes might have finally gotten more respect this year. As the only major award that honors film and TV, the trophies could have looked more relevant than ever, reflecting how viewers in the streaming era are blending their entertainment on small screens at home.<br />“They’ve done an excellent job in making themselves important,” said Hawk Koch, a film producer and former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars. Recent controversies may take a toll, he said, but the Globes remain influential. “People take it kind of half seriously—it’s good for everybody in the industry because it gives us more exposure.”</td>

The government is projecting that about 9,000 children will be taken into custody by the end of February.<br />U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported taking 5,707 unaccompanied children into custody in January, an 18% rise from the previous month. The growing number of children in custody is beginning to strain the government’s ability to properly house and care for them.<br />(This is a developing story.)</td>

      <td>The world’s largest chain of cinemas found some unlikely allies in its quest to stay afloat through the pandemic</td>
      <td>A frenzied rally that began with videogame retailer  GameStop Corp.  boosted the fortunes of the world’s largest movie theater chain, aiding  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  in its yearlong quest to survive the pandemic. No one was more surprised by the turn of events than AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron.<br />“I was completely oblivious to GameStop,” Mr. Aron said. “I had never heard of them.”<br />In late January a group of renegade individual investors banding together on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets turned their attention to AMC following their successful campaign to pump up the stock of GameStop. For AMC, the attention was far-fetched even for a company that depends on fictional Hollywood story lines to lure people into its theaters. It wasn’t so long ago that a bankruptcy filing loomed as its likely finale.<br />In the span of 72 hours, AMC’s stock soared 467%. The hashtag #SaveAMC proliferated on social media, attached to memes showing images of AMC theaters superimposed on the surface of the moon—a symbol that Reddit traders use to represent their aspirations of the stock reaching stratosphere-busting heights. The mania helped AMC bag another $305 million from the stock market and slash its debt load by $600 million. After dipping back down to as low as $5.35 following the January peak, AMC shares rose again this week amid a new burst of meme-heavy social media attention. The stock climbed 41% through Friday, closing at $8.01.<br />What happened to AMC is a testament to a new force in financial markets: small-time investors whose collective power, often fueled by social media hype, can help determine a company’s fate.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The new U.S. energy secretary said Friday she plans to revive a $40 billion loan program for energy projects and to push for improvements to the country’s electric grid in the aftermath of this month’s deadly, widespread blackout.<br />Jennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor, is tasked by President Biden with shifting the Energy Department’s focus toward addressing climate change and bolstering clean-tech businesses. On Friday, her first full day on the job, Mr. Biden visited Texas to talk with local leaders about an Arctic chill that brought the state’s grid near a catastrophic collapse.<br />Ms. Granholm pointed to Texas and blackouts last year in California that she said illustrate how the U.S. electricity system struggles with increasing demand and extreme weather. In one of her first interviews since winning Senate confirmation Thursday, she also said that the demands of the modern economy—envisioned by the Biden team as running on low-emissions technologies—will require federal support for the energy sector.<br />“If we’re going to add the gigawatts of clean energy to the grid that we need to in order to do electric vehicles, in order to accommodate all of the data centers that are being added, we have got to invest…and harden the grid,” Ms. Granholm said, referring to the growth of the internet industry and cloud computing.<br />Ms. Granholm said one of her top priorities is to use the department’s loan program to jumpstart her work. The program offering federal loans and loan guarantees to start-ups and energy projects has $40 billion authorized by Congress but untouched by the Trump administration. That can be funneled into companies bringing new energy technologies to market, especially for power units, battery storage and grid improvements, among others.</td>

The 10-year yield rose more than 0.3% in February for the largest one-month rise since November 2016.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed sharply on Thursday as a weekslong selloff intensified—fueled by bets that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates earlier than previously expected in response to what investors widely expect to be a burst of economic growth and inflation later this year.<br />The 10-year yield logged its largest one-day gain since Nov. 9 during Thursday’s session to finish at its highest closing level in a year. The five-year yield, which is more sensitive to the near-term outlook for interest rates, experienced its largest one-day gain in more than 10 years.<br />Higher yields, though, helped investors regain their appetite for Treasurys on Friday. Demand was also boosted by it being the last trading session of the month, when many fund managers buy Treasurys to match the adjustments in their benchmark bond indexes.</td>

John Milton argued for truth: “Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter?” The answer to that question is this: Truth has nothing to fear from error in a free exchange of ideas, and therein lies the challenge we face in our current reality. In today’s world there is little opportunity for such a free exchange of ideas, whether in the academy, social media or even in the formation of government policy. To believe otherwise is both naive and dangerous. In part, Rush Limbaugh’s popularity can be traced to that reality.<br />Alan Pue<br />Castle Rock, Colo.<br /><br />In referring to the 1987 abolition of the Fairness Doctrine, Ms. Noonan asks: “Has anything in our political culture gotten better since it was removed?” When we at the FCC proposed its abolition, most conservatives fiercely opposed us. They saw the doctrine as the only legal bulwark protecting the president against savage attacks from the three major networks. With all the controversy, President Reagan asked for a briefing. With a group of hostile advisers looking on, I explained that the plain language of the First Amendment meant that the press that used air and electrons must be as free as the press that used paper and ink. The president listened intently. A key adviser spoke up. With stiff opposition from his conservative base, at the least, he warned, Reagan should stay out of the fight.</td>

The victim, who wasn’t identified by police, was listed in stable condition at Bellevue hospital Friday. The officials said the victim was walking home at the time.<br />According to officials, Mr. Muflihi, 23 yearsw old, approached a security guard after the incident and said, “I just stabbed someone.” Mr. Muflihi later told detectives that he stabbed the man because he didn’t like the way the man looked at him, the officials said.<br />Mr Muflihi may have been suffering from psychological distress at the time of the attack, according to the officials.<br />The attack comes during a rise in violence in New York City and after a string of unprovoked assaults on Asians residents, including incidents that police say were motivated by racial bias. Thursday’s stabbing was brought to the attention of the NYPD’s Asian Hate Crimes Task Force, but initially it wasn’t being investigated as a hate crime, the officials said.</td>

      <td>Biden administration plans to let the Trump-era rule on technology purchases and deals take effect, despite U.S. business objections about its scope</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration plans to allow a sweeping Trump-era rule aimed at combating Chinese technology threats to take effect next month, over objections from U.S. businesses, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The rule, initially proposed in November, enables the Commerce Department to ban technology-related business transactions that it determines pose a national-security threat, part of an effort to secure U.S. supply chains. Companies in technology, telecommunications, finance and other industries say the rule could stifle innovation and hurt competitiveness, and had expected it to be delayed as the administration undertakes a broad review of U.S. policy on Chinese technology.<br />Now the administration is planning to go forward with the rule, the people said. Administration officials are concerned that blocking or diluting the rule would send the wrong message about the new administration’s approach to China, potentially fueling criticism that it is taking a weaker approach, according to the people.<br />One person familiar with the matter said administration officials have signaled to the business community that they won’t enforce the rule aggressively. That could soften the impact, although business representatives say the rule will still subject firms—especially smaller ones—to significant new compliance costs and uncertainty. Another person familiar with the matter said the administration hasn’t said it would hold back in enforcing the rule.<br />The rule is “unworkable for U.S. businesses in its current form and should not be considered for final publication without significant revisions,” said the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs of major companies from Amazon.com Inc. and Citigroup Inc. to Walmart Inc., in a comment filed with the Commerce Department in January. International Business Machines Corp. said the rule as written was “massively overbroad” and would harm the economy while failing to enhance U.S. national security.</td>

Democrats hope the chamber’s parliamentarian would allow them to include the modified plan in the coronavirus relief package.<br />The tax plan is being developed by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), and they haven’t finalized the details.<br />Mr. Wyden said Friday the proposal would impose a 5% penalty on the total payroll of a large corporation if it pays any workers below a certain amount, which he didn’t specify, with the penalty increasing over time. The plan would also provide small businesses that pay their employees higher wages with an income tax credit equal to 25% of wages, capped at $10,000 per employer a year.</td>

But none of the U.S. penalties will target Prince Mohammed directly, nor has the U.S. threatened broader measures such as a trade embargo or a withdrawal of support in Saudi Arabia’s proxy conflict with Iran or its role in the Yemen civil war. A senior administration official said the U.S. is eager to avoid a rupture of relations, but “we’ve also made clear that this administration will not sweep anything under the rug.”<br />The senior official, speaking before the report’s release, said the Biden administration values the 75-year strategic partnership with the oil-rich kingdom but “the reality here in the United States and in Washington is that the Saudis have just lost both political parties, support of the American people.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats tried to salvage a worker-pay increase after the existing minimum wage proposal was ruled out of bounds in the Senate, exploring a major change to the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 aid package as the House prepared to pass its version of the bill.<br />House passage of the relief plan, expected later Friday, will send the legislation to the Senate, where lawmakers will alter it. The House will then need to approve the amended bill before sending it to President Biden’s desk. Democrats are racing to finish the package before March 14, when certain types of federal unemployment assistance are set to expire.<br />The relief plan would enhance and extend federal unemployment benefits, provide $350 billion to state and local governments, send a $1,400 check to many Americans and fund vaccine distribution, among other measures. Republicans have largely lined up against the legislation, attacking it as too large and wasteful, in particular its provisions for school funding and state and local governments, as the economy shows signs of recovery.<br />The minimum-wage effort, which would raise the rate to $15 an hour by 2025, was thrown into doubt after a ruling from the Senate parliamentarian late Thursday effectively barred Democrats from including the measure as part of the plan. The nonpartisan parliamentarian said that raising the minimum wage wouldn’t comply with the body’s rules for legislation passed through a process called reconciliation, which allows a bill to be approved with 51 votes but requires that it be closely tied to the budget.<br />The finding created a political stress test for Democrats, who have largely remained united in the early weeks of Mr. Biden’s term.</td>

      <td>Growing up in India, Vandi Verma admired Spock on ‘Star Trek’ and wanted to be an engineer. Now she drives the NASA rover exploring the red planet.</td>
      <td>There’s some confusion about the time at which Vandi Verma and I are supposed to connect on Zoom. She’s in Pasadena, Calif., and I’m in New York. I assume there’s been an Eastern vs. Pacific clock-mix-up, but Ms. Verma doesn’t think about time “that way.” Instead, she says, “I usually check whether somebody’s talking about Earth time or Mars time.”<br />Ms. Verma has good reason to pay heed to the time on Mars, currently 134 million miles away. She’s the chief engineer of robotic operations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Perseverance rover, which landed on Mars on Feb. 18. The sight of NASA scientists cheering the successful descent from their control room at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory lifted American hearts. But there were “many fewer people in the room,” she tells me, than when the last rover, Curiosity, reached the red planet in 2012: “There had to be distancing this time because of the pandemic. So there were people in other rooms, and others observing remotely.”<br />Ms. Verma and her team are responsible for “everything to do with the mobility of the rover,” which includes driving and navigation as well as operating the robotic arm that gathers rock and core samples on Mars. They also oversee the Ingenuity helicopter, a small, autonomous rotorcraft that weighs 4 pounds and spans 4 feet. “This will,” she tells me, “be the first aircraft to attempt powered, controlled flight on another planet.”<br />Ms. Verma does some of the driving of Perseverance herself, often remotely from home thanks to Covid. Her 18-month-old twins, Arjun and Anya, are usually home, so they’re often on Mars time, too, “although it’s sometimes hard to manage them.” Fortunately, her husband, a systems engineer at JPL, is on hand to help. Ms. Verma thinks she has it easy. Some colleagues have more-taxing “Earth-time counterparts in their life”—significant others and older children who have a hard time coexisting on cross-planetary clocks.<br />A Mars day, called a sol, is 40 minutes longer than an Earth day, so the time difference changes every day. “You try to get synchronized with Mars, instead of Earth,” Ms. Verma says. “So we’ll eat breakfast at 10 p.m. if that’s when it’s breakfast time on Mars, and dinner at 5 a.m. if it’s night there.” She tries to avoid “Earth light when it isn’t daytime on Mars, because it helps a lot with your circadian rhythm.” Ms. Verma has been driving Mars rovers since 2008, so she has some advice for rookies: “No matter how dark your curtains are, they aren’t ever dark enough to keep the light out. So it helps to put tinfoil on the windows, to completely block the light.”</td>

      <td>Nostalgia can bring comfort and meaning, even inspiration. It’s about the future more than the past.</td>
      <td>Nostalgia has a bad reputation. Some people view it as unhealthy, a mental weakness signifying fear of change and progress. Many see it as a form of escapism, a feeling that people enjoy because it takes them away from reality and back to their youth. I’ve even heard it argued that nostalgia is bad for business, as companies need to focus on the present and prepare for the future, not dwell on the past.<br />A growing body of research indicates that all these intuitions about nostalgia are wrong. Reflecting nostalgically on the past is a common and healthy experience that helps people find the inspiration and confidence needed to move forward in life, particularly during difficult times. I would go so far as to say that nostalgia is about the future more than the past.<br />The term was coined in 1688 by Swiss physician Johannes Hofer to capture what was believed to be a medical condition mostly confined to Swiss mercenaries longing for their mountain home while fighting wars in the lowlands of Europe. Symptoms included deep sadness, bouts of weeping, fainting, stomach pain, disordered eating, fever, heart palpitations and suicidal thoughts. This medical-disease framing persisted through the 18th and 19th centuries, though diagnoses expanded beyond the Swiss. With the arrival of the 20th century, nostalgia was no longer treated as a physical disease but began to be thought of as a psychological ailment with symptoms we might associate today with anxiety and depression.<br />Later in the 20th century, some scholars began to see nostalgia in a more sympathetic light, distinguished from the more unpleasant state of homesickness. Consumer psychologists and marketing researchers documented ways in which sentimentality toward the past predicted product preference and consumer decisions. But we hadn’t yet conducted the systematic studies needed truly to understand nostalgia. This changed in the first decade of this new century when researchers, including my team, approached the study of nostalgia using the modern tools of behavioral science.<br />We observed that nostalgia doesn’t cause distress. Instead, distress causes nostalgia. External cues such as running into an old friend, seeing an old photo on  Facebook ,  or hearing music from one’s youth can trigger nostalgia, but when it comes to internal psychological triggers, people tend to experience nostalgia in response to feeling sad, lonely, meaningless and uncertain about where they are in life.</td>

      <td>While larger companies are deciding how much of their workforce to send back to the office once the pandemic recedes, an increasing number of tech startups are wondering if they can make do without a lease altogether.<br />The crash course in remote work over the past year has shown some tech entrepreneurs that their ability to collaborate online is strong—and that they might be better off building their businesses entirely in the cloud. Founders could save money on rent and hire employees wherever they want to live.<br />Going cloud-only may not be for all companies. Even in the software sector, where the work doesn’t generally involve designing and building tangible objects, there are a host of challenges to dispensing entirely with offices. These range from learning the communication habits of colleagues who never met in person to fostering the kinds of relationships it takes to fundraise from afar. Decades of research point to the power of proximity, augmenting the lore around Silicon Valley, and the birth of the world’s most successful companies.<br />But some startup founders, like Alan d’Escragnolle, aren’t struggling with trade-offs and are finding the benefits of remote work worth it: He said his team brainstorms just as well remotely and that employee productivity hasn’t suffered.<br />A year ago, Mr. d’Escragnolle was set to join his co-founder at Filmhub, an online film-distribution startup, in Los Angeles to sign an office lease and start hiring. Instead, he ended up renting a ski house in Lake Tahoe, and has been running the company from there since March.</td>

      <td>Erik Satie’s ‘Gymnopédies,’ all composed in 1888, have had an impact on the music of the 20th century and today that belies their modest scale</td>
      <td><br />Even amid the tornado of cultural experimentation that defined La Belle Epoque—those four fertile decades in France that preceded World War I—Erik Satie (1866-1925) was a singularly windy eccentric. He declared himself not a musician but a “phonometographer.” He was almost a parody of a bohemian, strolling Paris streets in his frock coat and hat, his beard unkempt and his hair long. Living alone in shabby conditions, working intermittently as a pianist in cafes in the early 1890s, collecting umbrellas, Satie had made good on his college teacher’s designation of him as “the laziest student at the Conservatoire.”<br />Yet this notoriously idiosyncratic figure had already composed three short pieces that remain among the most popular, influential and lovely piano works produced in the 19th century. Their name is characteristically bizarre: the “Gymnopédies,” derived from the Gymnopaedia—the festival where naked young men in ancient Sparta participated in war dancing. The title is deceptively complicated; the “Gymnopédies” are austere works.<br />Though all three pieces were composed in 1888, when he was still in his early 20s, Satie published the “Gymnopédies” separately over the next seven years. They were first performed separately at the Chat Noir in Montmartre, a cabaret where Satie became a pianist. The only available evidence of their reception comes from the newsletter of the Chat Noir: “We cannot recommend this essentially artistic work highly enough to the musical public,” it read. “It may rightly be considered as one of the most beautiful of the century that has witnessed the birth of this unfortunate gentleman.” Satie almost certainly wrote that notice himself.<br />At the time he composed the “Gymnopédies,” French music was still huddling defensively in the enormous shadow of Wagner’s operas. The German Romantic had died five years earlier, but even from the grave he would influence the French music scene for the next 20 years or more. With its stripped-down plainness, Satie’s suite was as contrary to the German composer’s grandiose symphonies as it was possible to be.</td>

      <td>Movie-theater chain has stayed out of the meme-stock spotlight that has glared on rival AMC</td>
      <td>Among U.S- based movie-theater chains,  AMC Entertainment  has definitely provided more entertainment of late. But Cinemark’s comparatively boring show might be more worth tuning in to.<br />Texas-based Cinemark has been overshadowed by the attention investors have focused on its competitor. Next to  GameStop ,  AMC has become perhaps the second hottest in a crowd of so-called “meme stocks” favored by the WallStreetBets crowd on Reddit. Before Cinemark’s fourth-quarter results Friday morning, AMC shares were up 291% so far this year compared with about 31% for Cinemark.<br />AMC’s weaker financial footing seemed to be a draw for the risk-addicted YOLO crowd, who saw the company as teetering on bankruptcy and as a possible investment or buyout target by a bigger Hollywood player. Cinemark by contrast has long been considered the most financially stable of the major theater chains. Michael Pachter of Wedbush wrote to clients earlier this week that he expects Cinemark “to come out of the pandemic relatively unscathed.” Of AMC, he predicted, “it will be years before AMC is able to revisit its prior growth strategy as it repays its growing mountain of debt.”<br />Cinemark’s fourth-quarter revenue plunged 88% from a year earlier to $98.2 million, and attendance was about 10% of the prior year’s comparable period. The company said it burned about $65 million in cash a month during the quarter. Still, revenue well exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, thanks in part to some innovative moves such as private watch parties, where families or other small groups rent a full auditorium for $99. These accounted for 24% of U.S. admissions revenue for the quarter. The company also says its “cash runway” extends into the fourth quarter, and even into 2022 including the tax refunds it expects to receive.<br />Cinemark has good reason to be more upbeat since its last report on Nov. 5, which came just days before news of the first major coronavirus vaccine breakthrough. A growing pace of vaccinations and plunging infection rates is allowing New York theaters to start reopening March 5, and Cinemark Chief Executive Mark Zoradi said Friday he expects the key markets of Los Angeles and San Francisco to begin reopening “in the coming weeks.”</td>

Mr. Trump’s image is splashed all over this year’s conference, where MAGA paraphernalia is abundant.<br />“We have a party led by Donald J. Trump,” said Ohio Senate candidate Josh Mandel, who criticized “squishy Republican governors” who had implemented widespread restrictions to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Mandel, one of many Trump-aligned candidates who have announced campaign bids in recent weeks, called himself “pro-gun, pro-life, pro-Trump.”<br />Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, touted his keep-the-economy-open approach to Covid-19, championed by Mr. Trump during his time in office. The annual CPAC event is typically hosted near Washington but relocated to Florida, where state Covid-19 restrictions allow for mass gatherings like CPAC to occur indoors, something Mr. DeSantis and others applauded Friday. CPAC organizers have limited the number of attendees because of Covid; in the past, more than 10,000 people have attended. The event is also being streamed online.<br />The governor also cited a need for strict enforcement of immigration law, including the border wall advocated by Mr. Trump, to curb the flow of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. “We cannot—we will not—go back to the days of the failed Republican establishment of yesteryear,” Mr. DeSantis said.</td>

      <td>Artist Alexis Rockman creates vividly realistic pictures of doomed vessels from history and mythology.</td>
      <td>The roots of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass., date back to 1799, when a group including local ships’ captains established a “cabinet of natural and artificial curiosities” to display the treasures they had accumulated in their voyages. Starting March 6, a new exhibition will display images of a sailor’s greatest nightmare. In “Shipwrecks,” contemporary artist Alexis Rockman turns his vivid, realistic style to scenes of cannibalism, ice, drifting animals and doomed men.<br />The show, which moves in a larger version on June 13 to Guild Hall in the Hamptons, includes canvases and watercolors representing episodes from history and myth. One picture portrays the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in the Pacific in the last weeks of World War II, including the shark attacks on surviving sailors. Another features threats that might have kept a Viking sailor up at night: ship-destroying whirlpools, threatening whales and the mythical sea-monster known as the Kraken, all about to overpower a small, fragile boat.<br />The “Shipwrecks” series is a departure for the 58-year-old Mr. Rockman, who is best known for his apocalyptic panoramas of climate change, pollution and species extinctions. In one of his best-known works, “Manifest Destiny” (2004), the ocean has submerged the Brooklyn waterfront, and the arches of the Brooklyn Bridge crumble before our eyes.<br />Why focus on shipwrecks? Mr. Rockman points out that in 19th-century New England, paintings of wrecks were a popular genre, and today there’s “nothing more cliché than a shipwreck painting over a mantelpiece.” He loves the challenge of putting new life into an old genre supposedly “not worthy of reconsideration.”<br />The earliest painting in the show, “The Sinking of the Brig Helen” (2017), portrays a famous episode in the history of biology. Alfred Russel Wallace, a contemporary of Darwin’s who independently worked out the theory of natural selection, was on board the Helen when it sank, returning to England from a four-year collecting trip in South America. Wallace survived but lost his collection of thousands of specimens, including living birds and monkeys.</td>

      <td>Yes, but beware the many hurdles.<br />While much of Europe still remains closed to American tourists, a number of Caribbean, South and Central American, and African countries have re-opened their borders to U.S. travelers. That said, the entry requirements are all over the map, ranging from proof of a negative Covid-19 test to mandatory self- isolation to the need to adopt electronic trackers. What’s more, the U.S. State Department warns that foreign governments could change their restrictions with little notice, which means trip plans can easily go awry and Americans overseas might face unforeseen challenges coming back to the U.S.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which still maintains that staying home is the surest way to avoid getting or transmitting Covid-19, has issued country-specific advisories. More than 150 countries, including much of Europe, fall under the CDC’s sternest Level 4 advisory, which recommends avoiding all travel.<br />As of Jan. 26, international travelers face another obstacle: All airline passengers flying into the U.S., including U.S. citizens, must present a negative Covid-19 test taken within three days of their departure from a foreign country or proof of recovery from coronavirus. Show up at the airport overseas for your departing flight empty-handed and you won’t be allowed on the plane. For more on which countries currently welcome American travelers, see “Where Can I Travel Internationally and Do I Need the Covid-19 Vaccine?”<br />No. The closure of the U.S.-Canada border was extended once again until at least Feb. 21, which means tourists are still prohibited from entering Canada by sea, plane, car or other means.

The idea, proposed in late 2019 by her predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, drew objections from European counterparts, though talks on how it would work never advanced very far.<br />Ms. Yellen made her remarks to finance ministers of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging-market economies at a virtual meeting. According to a Treasury official, Ms. Yellen said the U.S. would continue to engage on both parts of the tax project being led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development: a push to redefine where corporate income is taxed and a parallel effort to impose minimum taxes.<br />Ms. Yellen’s decision doesn’t guarantee that a deal will be reached. The global talks have moved in fits and starts for years, driven by European countries’ frustrations that U.S. technology companies such as  Facebook Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.  have such a large presence in their economies but pay relatively little in corporate taxes.<br />Corporate profits are taxed where value is created, not where customers are located. Negotiators have sought to give countries where international companies operate more power to tax them. In the absence of a deal, some have imposed digital-service taxes that are levies on the companies’ revenue from those jurisdictions.</td>

His annual letter, however, is likely to provide significant insight into how the chief executive and chairman of Berkshire sees the economy and markets from here.<br />Despite being largely quiet for the past year, Mr. Buffett hasn’t been inactive. Here are eight moves the conglomerate made—and didn’t make—since the pandemic took hold that could shed light into what he plans to address on Saturday.<br />Last spring, Mr. Buffett announced that Berkshire sold all its stakes in U.S. airlines—including United Continental Holdings Inc.,  American Airlines Group Inc.,   Delta Air Lines Inc.  and  Southwest Airlines Co. —suggesting he sees a tough road ahead for the commercial-airline business model. “The world changed for airlines,” he said at the annual meeting in May.</td>

      <td>Savings rates have spiked and many American households are sitting on large cash balances</td>
      <td>As a group, Americans have amassed an astounding amount of savings during the pandemic. A lot of that money rests in the bank accounts of the rich, but—and this is crucial—not all of it.<br />The Commerce Department on Friday reported that personal income shot up a seasonally adjusted 10% in January from December, buoyed by the latest round of pandemic-relief payments. Spending rose strongly, too, but with a gain of 2.4% from the prior month, not by nearly as much. And with that, the personal saving rate—or saving as a share of after-tax income—shot to 20.5% from 13.4%. That marks its highest level since May. The only time the saving rate was higher before the pandemic was during World War II.<br />The elevated savings rate isn’t just about government payments. It also stems from the weakness in services spending that has occurred during the Covid-19 crisis as people have forgone things like vacations and dining out. Friday’s report showed that services spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of all consumer spending, was down 5.3% from its year-earlier level.<br />The high saving rates that have been in place since the pandemic began have added up to a lot more cash on household balance sheets. Federal Reserve figures show that as of the end of the third quarter households had $2.2 trillion more in cash and cash equivalents than at the end of 2019. That amount is undoubtedly higher now and, with another round of government relief in the works, could go higher still. As the pandemic eases, there will be plenty of money to spend.<br />The rub is that, when it comes to absolute dollar amounts, it is wealthier households that have amassed the most savings. They have had an easier time keeping their jobs during the crisis, and they had the most discretionary spending to cut back on. So there is a case to be made that if the pandemic eases, it will be companies that cater to the better off that will do best.</td>

      <td>As he chafes against the pandemic’s restrictions, the country legend has released two albums while overseeing a radio channel and two cannabis companies</td>
      <td>You might think that Willie Nelson, at age 87, would enjoy a chance to slow down his constant touring, after decades of playing about 150 shows a year, two weeks on and two weeks off. But when Covid-19 shut down live performances last year, the self-proclaimed “road dog” didn’t repair to his Texas ranch or his Maui home to relax and wait things out.<br />“This is the worst time of my life,” he says. “I have never been this frustrated. I try to think positive, but I feel like I’m in jail—I can’t go here, I can’t go there—and that really pisses me off.”<br />Mr. Nelson remains strikingly prolific, averaging about a new album a year while also writing books. He also oversees a SiriusXM channel called Willie’s Roadhouse and two cannabis companies: Willie’s Reserve, which sells a range of products with THC (the principal intoxicating compound in cannabis) and says it operates “under a simple philosophy: my stash is your stash,” and Willie’s Remedy, which features hemp-based “wellness products,” including CBD-infused coffee, tea and lotions.<br />“That’s Life,” a big-band tribute to Frank Sinatra released Feb. 26, is Mr. Nelson’s second release of the pandemic, following last July’s sparse, elegiac “First Rose of Spring.” That album made its debut at number five on the Billboard country album chart—Mr. Nelson’s staggering 53rd top-10 album, making him the only artist to have a top-10 country album in seven straight decades, from the 1960s to the 2020s.<br />That run is particularly amazing for an artist who, early in his career, was sometimes considered too stark, idiosyncratic or downright weird to make it as a country performer. Mr. Nelson’s first triumphs were as a songwriter, most notably with Patsy Cline’s 1961 take on his ballad “Crazy,” which became one of the biggest jukebox hits of all time. He recorded as a solo artist from 1962-72 but didn’t find consistent success until he ditched Nashville, haircuts, suits and alcohol in favor of Texas, long braids, jeans and joints.</td>

      <td>While the pandemic made most Americans housebound, it also inspired a number of people to move overseas indefinitely in search of greater freedom. Here’s how and where to do it.</td>
      <td>THE COVID-19 pandemic squashed countless dreams around the world. But it also helped a few come true.<br />Laurie Beijen’s family had long wanted to move from San Francisco to Spain for a year. Her husband had been able to do it twice as a child, thanks to the sabbaticals his professor father took, and he wanted his kids to have a similar formative experience.<br />“We never figured out how we could make it work,” said Ms. Beijen, 46, who manages rental properties. Last fall, with Ms. Beijen and her husband both working remotely and their kids, 11 and 9, in school two days a week, an ambitious plan emerged. “We were like, we can either sit here and have Groundhog Day every day, like we’ve been doing for the past several months,” Ms. Beijen said, “or we can do something with this time and really kind of make it matter.” It took a few months to assemble their visa paperwork (“like the biggest term paper I’ve ever done,” she said). They submitted it the day before Thanksgiving, received approval in January and departed a few days later.<br />Now they’re living in a small town outside of Valencia, in southeastern Spain. The modernized farmhouse the family rented is surrounded by orange and avocado trees; on weekends they visit nearby beaches and castles. The kids attend a private British school nearby—in person, five days a week. “So far so good,” Ms. Beijen said.<br />The Department of State estimates that some 9 million U.S. citizens live outside of the country. When Covid-19 closed borders and triggered restrictions around the world, thousands of them returned home—even diplomats, as some 6,000 were evacuated with their families. But other Americans are bucking the trend, leaving the U.S. to live overseas for anywhere from a few months to indefinitely. A number of hotels and resorts have been capitalizing on the appeal of extended stays, offering discounts and upgrades for bookings that are over 14 days or a month. Luxury travel company Embark Beyond launched an Embark Longer program, which offers discounts and amenities such as unlimited laundry service for resort and villa stays upward of a month. “We have clients staying several months in places like St. Barts and even Ireland,” said Jack Ezon founder of Embark Beyond. And several countries are offering special streamlined visa programs that allow foreigners to work legally for several months or a year (see “Stay Awhile” below).</td>

But the plan quickly took on water when the buyers were informed that they had to comply with maritime law, such as being insured and paying premiums in fiat currency.<br />“Unfortunately, we will not be able to proceed because of archaic big insurance companies that cannot adapt to innovative new ideas,” wrote Ocean Builders Chief Executive Grant Romundt in an email to investors.<br />According to a Facebook fan page, MS Satoshi was sold for scrap and was last reported to be steaming to a yard in India to be broken up.</td>

That places Birkenstock in the Arnault family portfolio alongside  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE ,  the globe-spanning luxury conglomerate that Mr. Arnault controls.<br />“We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage,” Mr. Arnault said.<br />The investment is a sign of how the fashion world has come around to a brand that it once snubbed as the unglamorous footwear of granola-eating hippies.<br />Boot maker Johann Adam Birkenstock founded the company in 1774, but the sandals first arrived in the U.S. in the 1960s on the feet of Margot Fraser, a dressmaker who grew up in Germany. Ms. Fraser was turned away from shoe stores as she tried to find a distributor for Birkenstock. She eventually ended up selling the sandals out of a health-food store in California.</td>

The hospital’s chief medical officer, Dr. Anish Mahajan, said he suffered “significant orthopedic injuries.”<br />Woods suffered comminuted open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula bones in the leg, which was stabilized with a rod inserted into the tibia, Dr. Mahajan said in the statement.

      <td>American society is more willing than ever before to speak out against racism and to embrace Black history, but we continue to make the fatal mistake of taking the concept of race itself for granted.</td>
      <td>It is a useful and thought-provoking exercise to attempt to explain, in James Baldwin’s apt phrase, the “system of reality” of one’s own country to foreigners. Why, for example, do we venerate the men and women we choose to put on pedestals? Why do we memorize certain dates and not other ones? Why do we recount events from one vantage point and not another? Speaking with someone who shares few if any of your own assumptions about these matters forces you to spell things out step by step and re-evaluate much of what you assume to be normal.<br />In France, where I have lived for the past decade, I find myself frequently discussing America’s at turns maddening and inspiring racial history, which can seem exotic from this side of the Atlantic. When I first arrived in Paris, that meant listening happily and even haughtily to my European interlocutors as they expressed esteem tinged with disbelief at the feat of Barack Obama’s barrier-shattering presidency, which they used as an unflattering measuring stick for their own societies. In the era of Donald Trump, those conversations turned dramatically less admiring and much more perplexed and even pitying. In the wake of the international racial justice movement sparked by George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis while in police custody, and as the author of a book about the need to “unlearn” received habits of thought about racial categorization, I am now constantly being asked to make sense of legacies of oppression and to speculate about how to transcend them.<br />For foreigners not steeped in what the writer Stanley Crouch termed the “all-American skin game,” it can be difficult to grasp why, as many on the left now believe, the best way to rectify the corrosive effects of racial differentiation and discrimination is to find new and better ways to differentiate and discriminate…by race. At Fieldston, a $50,000-a-year New York City private school, children as young as 8 years old are segregated into racial “affinity groups.” On Twitter, viral hashtag movements encourage educators to “disrupt texts” and assign students of all ages only those authors whose complexion, gender or sexuality mirrors their own. Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley declared in 2019 that “We don’t need any more Black faces that don’t want to be a Black voice”—the implication being that even our values and ideas must fit within racialized fences.<br />The scholars (and sisters) Karen E. Fields and Barbara J. Fields have assigned the term “racecraft” to the mental terrain, mores and customs of language that are produced by racism. They see racecraft—and not superficial physical differences—as the engine of America’s pervasive belief in the illusion of race. And so, especially at this time of year, another common question for an American abroad can be: What is the need for Black History Month? Why isn’t U.S. history sufficient?<br />When the pioneering journalist and historian Carter G. Woodson (“the father of Black history”) created Negro History Week in February 1926, in the same month as the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, its reason for being was self-evident. It was an efficient and practical way of increasing public recognition of a community that had been enslaved just two generations prior. It would be almost another 40 years before the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s secured equal citizenship and legal protection for this besieged population. Following the turbulence and violence of that decade, and anticipating the cultural shift toward Black power and nationalism, Black History Month was first proposed by educators and the Black United Students organization at Kent State University in February 1969.</td>

Board members are selected by the ministry of finance. Katherine Cuplinskas, a spokeswoman for Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland, said the minister spoke to CPPIB’s board of directors Thursday night about Mr. Machin’s trip to make “clear that Canadians place their trust in the CPPIB and expect it to be held to a higher standard.”<br />“We are very disappointed by this troubling situation and we support the swift action taken by the Board of Directors,” Ms. Cuplinskas said.</td>

      <td>For a subtle creator of imagined worlds, the line between happy and unhappy endings can be hard to define.</td>
      <td>Kazuo Ishiguro once offered a surprising comment about “Never Let Me Go,” his novel—for those who haven’t had it soldered into their memories—about cloned humans who lead relatively ordinary lives into young adulthood, at which point their vital organs are harvested and they die. “I thought it was a very cheerful book,” Mr. Ishiguro said. “It’s a very optimistic view of human nature. People laugh when I say that, and I think it’s very unfair.”<br />Writers often have idiosyncratic perspectives on their work, but I can think of few cases in which public interpretation seems to have diverged so widely from authorial motive. For many readers, the novel, with its disarmingly unaffected narration by a “carer” for organ donors (who will soon become a donor herself), is a work of quiet horror and heartbreak, in which the futility of cloned lives, as the New Yorker’s critic James Wood wrote, “forces us to consider the futility of our own.”<br />Yet to Mr. Ishiguro, the dystopian cruelty of his story’s premise is a secondary matter. In the lecture he delivered in Stockholm after winning the 2017 Nobel Prize in Literature, he says that the novel originated with the “central relationships triangle” of the three cloned friends. It is because of their comportment in the full knowledge of their fate—their thoughtfulness, their compassion toward each other, their loyalty and love—that he considers the book a celebration of humanity.<br />Who’s right? Perhaps we have found a key to Mr. Ishiguro’s phenomenal international success by recognizing his novels as open texts, able to accommodate multiple readings. Ironic contrast is a staple of his books. Set against a backdrop of civilizational cataclysm (the bombing of Nagasaki in “A Pale View of the Hills,” for instance, or the genocidal Anglo-Saxon conquest in “The Buried Giant”), the action tends to dwell upon small, insular acts of duty and of decency. The latter are sometimes rationalized as mere distractions from the unpleasantness of facing the former. In Mr. Ishiguro’s most famous book, “The Remains of the Day,” the butler who has devoted his best years to serving a Nazi sympathizer is usually described as a case study in cowardly self-delusion. But the novel would have no pathos if we didn’t also identify real virtues in the butler’s sobriety, attentiveness and self-effacing discretion—qualities, not accidentally, that characterize Mr. Ishiguro’s style of writing.<br />In his new novel, “Klara and the Sun,” there is another uncertain meeting between the horrifying and the heartwarming. This is a return to the kind of science-fictional future of “Never Let Me Go.” Klara, the narrator, is an AF, or Artificial Friend, and the story begins in the boutique shop where she is displayed for the privileged class of children who are expected to own such luxury companions. Klara is purchased for Josie, a sweet, sickly teenage girl who lives with her harried mother and a housekeeper outside the city. Klara’s job is to keep Josie’s spirits up as she battles her illness, and on the simplest level this is a fairy tale about the animating power of love between a child and her toy, similar to “The Velveteen Rabbit” or “Toy Story.”</td>

      <td>While he explored the pleasures of the flesh, Bacon’s art plumbed the terrors of the soul.</td>
      <td>In the spring of 1949, the press baron Viscount Rothermere gave a ball that defied Britain’s postwar decline. The men wore white tie, the women their family jewels. The Queen Mother was there, and so was the royal of the moment, Princess Margaret. Late that night, the princess, giddy with Champagne, took the mic from Noël Coward and delivered her party trick. Her Royal Highness began to sing, off-key and out of time. The revelers loyally cheered and called for more.<br />Margaret was just beginning to mutilate “Let’s Do It” when a “prolonged and thunderous booing” emerged from the crowd. The band stopped, and the princess reddened and rushed from the room. “Who did that?” Lady Caroline Blackwood asked the man at her side. “It was that dreadful man, Francis Bacon,” he fumed. “He calls himself a painter but he does the most frightful paintings.”<br />More than a decade before the end of the “Lady Chatterley” ban and The Beatles’s first LP, the iconoclasm of Francis Bacon announced a new era in British life. By his death in Madrid in 1992, Bacon was a social and artistic icon, his battered face the image of painterly tradition. Openly gay, he was the king of Soho, a nocturnal drinker and cruiser, his motto “Champagne for my real friends, real pain for my sham friends.” By day, alone in his studio, he was the exposer of torn flesh and gaping mouths, of the secret shames and spiritual collapse that, in the postwar decades when French thinkers ruled in concert with French painters, made him the only truly English existentialist.<br />With “Revelations,” Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan enter a biographical field as crowded as the Colony Room on a Friday night. Almost all the revelations are already revealed: the Baconian literature includes testimonies from Bacon’s critical patron David Sylvester; his fellow artist and slummer Lucian Freud; his drinking friend Dan Farson; and his assistant Michael Peppiatt. Mr. Stevens and Ms. Swan might, like Bacon’s friends, share a tendency to confuse the man with the art—like Oscar Wilde, Bacon was his own best work—but they bring a sober eye and an organizing mind to Bacon’s “gilded gutter life.” As in their acclaimed “de Kooning,” the authors frame their subject and his work as a portrait of the age.<br />The English existentialist was, naturally enough, Irish. Born in 1909 to a sclerotic, fox-hunting soldier and an errant industrial heiress, the sensitive and asthmatic Francis was raised in as a minority within a minority, the Anglo-Irish gentry that would dissolve amid terrorism and the birth of the Irish Free State in 1922. He later spoke of how he desired the father who despised him for his asthmatic fear of horses; his sexual initiation came from the grooms in the stifling dust of the stables.</td>

      <td>Deeper understanding of our genetic code unlocks an entirely new perspective on longevity.</td>
      <td>On arriving in London to seek his fortune, the rambunctious Scottish physician George Cheyne set about hobnobbing in coffee houses and taverns, where he ate “lustily” and swallowed down “much liquor.” Before long, he had ballooned to nearly 450 pounds. In a state of existential crisis and discerning that his mortality was in the balance, he published a self-help manual, “An Essay of Health and Long Life” (1724). In this bestselling treatise, he singled out tea, coffee, chocolate and snuff as being especially detrimental to the human condition.<br />This seminal work, among others, spawned a tradition of books addressing the topic of longevity which continues to this day. While Cheyne and others contrived innumerable methods designed to maintain good health and extend lifespans, the process of aging has itself invariably been viewed as an immutable part of human nature.<br />No longer, says Andrew Steele in his entertaining and thoughtful book “Ageless” (Doubleday, 352 pages, $29). While we wither and become frail after a mere seven or so decades, the humble Galápagos tortoise bumbles on healthily into a 175-year dotage. Capturing this trait—known as negligible senescence—is the holy grail of aging research.<br />So if, as Mr. Steele contends, “tortoises get old without getting elderly,” might we not master “biological immortality” and become ageless too? Were this achievable, the existence of a bristlecone pine tree in California’s White Mountains, estimated to be an extraordinary 4,850 years old, suggests that such potential extensions to our longevity might be more than mere tweaks. The fact that lifespans of different species vary so greatly—some mayflies emerge, mate and die within 5 minutes, while bowhead whales can live for more than 200 years—indicates that our lifespan is programmed by evolution, rather than restricted by insurmountable constraints.<br />“Ageless” follows biologist George C. Williams’s simple evolutionary explanation for why we age, based on a phenomenon called “antagonistic pleiotropy.” Put simply, genes selected to facilitate early successful reproduction may have detrimental effects as we get older. In Mr. Steele’s words, it looks as if evolution has traded our “future health for increased reproduction.” Were we able to roll the clock back and redesign ourselves, we would doubtless find alternative genetic circuits that did not have these unfortunate consequences. Perhaps one day, Mr. Steele conjectures, we will be able to reprogram our genomes to remove this legacy. Fortunately, there may be more immediately accessible paths to a longer life.</td>

      <td>Florida senator seeks to ensure Republicans win back Senate majority in 2022 without choosing sides between the two leaders</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—When Rick Scott spoke by phone with former President Donald Trump last week, the Florida senator told Mr. Trump he needed his help to ensure Republicans win back the Senate majority in 2022.<br />Mr. Scott heads the Senate Republicans’ campaign committee, which is tasked in part with helping re-elect the party’s incumbents. But he didn’t ask Mr. Trump to refrain from endorsing primary opponents against GOP senators whom Mr. Trump has derided as disloyal for publicly criticizing him, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.<br />“No, I never talked to him about that,” Mr. Scott said in an interview. “If endorsements mattered, I wouldn’t have been a governor, and I wouldn’t have been a U.S. senator.”<br />The strategy is characteristic of how Mr. Scott plans to approach a series of competitive primaries that will be the next proving ground in the fight for the future of the GOP.<br />The wealthy businessman and former governor adamantly rejects the narrative that the Republican Party is embroiled in a civil war, even as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) accused Mr. Trump of a “disgraceful dereliction of duty,” and Mr. Trump slammed Mr. McConnell as a “political hack,” pledging to field his own primary rivals.</td>

Universal Health said that it believed the company would be entitled to recoup costs through insurance.

It continued a streak of wins at the distance that track-geek site letsrun.com called “easily the greatest 60-meter hurdles season the world has ever seen.”<br />Even more remarkable than Holloway’s speed, though, is how he’s achieving it.

      <td>NEW DELHI—India’s economy, one of the hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, started growing again last quarter, but the recovery is being driven by those with the highest incomes, while the poor are still struggling.<br />The country’s gross domestic product grew by 0.4% in the three months through Dec. 31, driven by India’s biggest companies and richest consumers. They emerged from the worst of the Covid-19 crisis last year with more savings and lower costs, and are now lifting growth as the spread of the virus slows.<br />But the millions of small family businesses and farms that employ more than 80% of the populace and make up the informal economy have had the opposite experience. Its businesses and consumers have had to dip into savings and seen demand disappear, said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive for the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent think tank in Mumbai.<br />“If you are a carpenter or a plumber or a mason or a cart pusher or a hawker, you lose income for the day,” when Covid-19 keeps people at home and companies close, Mr. Vyas said. “The hit is very direct.”<br />India may have had more people pushed back into poverty by the coronavirus than any other country. Lifting the incomes of those near the poverty level will determine the speed and shape of its post-pandemic recovery. Its struggle, even as its daily new infections have plunged to less than a fifth of their peak last year, could foreshadow struggles in other emerging economies.</td>

      <td>California aerospace startup Archer Aviation Inc. has a multibillion-dollar vision of flying people around town in autonomous electric helicopter-like vehicles. It doesn’t have revenue or a vehicle ready for passengers, but that hasn’t slowed the three-year-old company.<br />Instead of toiling away in obscurity with a shoestring budget, the traditional way for startups to spend their formative years, Archer became part of the SPAC frenzy gripping Wall Street. This month it announced an agreement to merge with a special-purpose acquisition company, raising $1.1 billion—and gaining a valuation of $2.7 billion.<br />“The SPAC market was actually a really great spot to go to raise a lot of capital in one big swoop,” Archer co-founder and co-CEO Adam Goldstein said. The company is slated to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange in a few months.<br />SPACs have flipped the script on the multidecade model of development for early-stage startups, enabling fledgling companies with little or no revenue to tap public markets sooner. The shift lets amateur investors—long excluded from startup wealth creation—get in on the ground floor of disruptive businesses. It is a dynamic that can lead to huge returns but also carries big risks, as young companies are far more vulnerable to going belly up.<br />Since the start of last year, investors have poured more than $130 billion into SPACs, “blank-check companies” traded on an exchange with the goal of merging with a private company to bring it public. Amateur stock traders and hedge funds alike have piled in, seeking high-growth companies.</td>

      <td>Probably not. Volkswagen’s first EV for the global market is long on curb appeal, light-footed among its competitive set—but comes up a bit short in engineering design, writes Dan Neil</td>
      <td>AS THE PRESENCE of our guest makes clear, global auto makers are starting to get serious about delivering electric vehicles. The 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 crossover ($45,190, as tested) is the blunt-nosed tip of VW Group’s $43-billion spear, the first of a bevy of battery beauties to be built globally on the company’s modular electric platform (MEB) in the next decade, including an EV microbus. Groovy.<br />With its sloe-eyed canopy and high-cut hips, optional LED-illuminated nose and 20-inch alloy Spirographs, the ID.4 is not without curb appeal. By virtue of the mechanism, its drivability beats the silk PJs off a comparable Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, which is the sort of cross-shopping the VW brand is most hoping for. Compared to this light-footed, sweet-singing creature, gas-burning competitors feel like puttering, muttering nincompoops.<br />Which reminds me: Whenever I write about electric cars it stirs up cranks on social media, who have often and with great certainty accused me of being in the pay of Elon Musk and Tesla. Rest assured, the management of the business newspaper of record does not allow reporters, columnists, or editors to profit in any way from the people and companies they cover. Zero, zip, nada. I’ll take my apology off the air.<br />So when I say the ID.4 is five years behind the comparable Tesla, it’s not because I’m an Elon fanboy, a VW hater, or that I have anything to gain or lose personally. That is my best guess, based on my weeklong test drive of VW’s hot-from-the-oven, slightly underbaked strudel.<br />Example: The ID.4’s touch-screen UX is a bit shambolic. The (optional) 12-inch center touch screen takes ages to boot up and can lag behind user inputs. It’s not very pretty, either. The “Car-Net” phone app—a Tesla-like remote interface with the car, accessing charging and climate functions—failed to talk to the car when I tried it several times.</td>

      <td>The home-share giant’s market value beats that of hotels—probably for good reason</td>
      <td>Against all odds,  Airbnb  might be a relatively safe place to rest both your family and your money in 2021.<br />It is true that the stock appears, on its surface, death-defyingly overvalued. With a market value of $120 billion, Airbnb is now worth more than  Marriott International ,   Hilton Hotels & Resorts ,   Hyatt Hotels  and  InterContinental Hotels Group  combined. That is to say, a bet on Airbnb this year reflects a conviction that the homestay market will own the hotel business to a degree that it never quite recovers in full.<br />The home-share giant reported fourth quarter results Thursday—its first report as a public company—showing revenue down just 22% year over year. That is hardly ideal, but it looks fantastic in comparison to its lodging peers. Revenue in the same period was down an average of 61% for Marriott and Hilton, for example, and an average of 65% for major online travel agents  Expedia  Group and  Booking Holdings ,  which derive a significant portion of their business from lodging bookings such as hotels and homestays. Perhaps more important, Airbnb’s business performed significantly better in the fourth quarter relative to its full-year results. Major hotels and online travel agents performed significantly worse.<br />Bottom-line comparisons look positive, too. Airbnb said it lost just $21 million on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $276 million in the same period a year prior. Marriott meanwhile swung to a loss in the fourth quarter and said it lost money for all of 2020 for the first time since 2009.<br />That bodes well for Airbnb’s pace of recovery and consumers’ likelihood to opt toward the safety of a homestay over the exposure of a hotel as the world slowly opens back up. Marriott, for one, is trying to revive its business by branding itself as the destination for “bleisure,”—the blending of post-pandemic work travel with a leisure vacation. But with millions of listings in 100,000 cities world-wide, that is exactly how Airbnb has been used for years. As Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said Thursday, his company is already a noun and a verb in pop culture.</td>

      <td>Slim coupons make much of the recently issued debt with maturities of between 50 and 100 years riskier than traditional bond math suggests</td>
      <td>Rising bond yields pose an outsize threat to one asset class in particular: ultra-long-dated debt.<br />Hopes of a fast economic recovery have given bonds their worst start to the year since 2015. Last October, 10-year Treasury yields were under 0.7%. Now, they hover around 1.5%. The jump has started to dent stocks: The S&P 500 fell 2.4% Thursday.<br />Markets still benefit from very loose financial conditions in inflation-adjusted terms, and the Federal Reserve made clear this week it won’t allow yields to go too high. That offers protection to stock investors, and even most bondholders.<br />The exceptions may be investors that bought debt issues maturing in 50 or more years’ time, particularly those with slim coupons.<br />So far, the big yield shifts are happening at shorter maturities. Yet France’s new 50-year government bond, issued on Jan. 26, has still lost 15% of its value. Over the same period, Austria’s latest 100-year bond has lost 21%. Their yields have only risen 0.4 percentage points.</td>

      <td>Vanita Gupta has been nominated for associate attorney general, the number 3 job at the Justice Department</td>
      <td>CONSERVATIVE GROUPS ZERO IN on President Biden’s pick for a high-ranking Justice Department post after largely declining to fight over Judge Merrick Garland’s nomination to be attorney general. The Judicial Crisis Network and former Reagan Attorney General Edwin Meese’s Conservative Action Project, along with a growing group of Republican state attorneys general, want to sink Vanita Gupta’s nomination to be associate attorney general. The No. 3 job at Justice comes with a major policy portfolio focused especially on federal and local law enforcement, and conservatives are aiming to highlight Gupta’s past supportive comments for reducing some police funding and redirecting it to other services in underserved communities.<br />The groups say those positions constitute support for defunding the police, a partisan lightning rod that Biden has repeatedly said he doesn’t support. Gupta has been in the thick of nationwide debates over policing for years, as the head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under former President Barack Obama and then as the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a prominent nonprofit.<br />JCN has launched an $800,000 digital and TV ad campaign to try to sink Gupta. Republican state attorneys general, led by Indiana’s Todd Rokita, are gathering signatures for a letter, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, that will be sent to Biden urging him to withdraw the nomination, accusing Gupta of having a “disinterest in meaningful police reform in favor of destructive policies that would defund the police.” The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on Gupta’s nomination for March 9.<br />The Biden administration has been steadfast in its support for Gupta’s nomination: At Garland’s confirmation hearing on Monday, he went on a lengthy defense of Gupta under questioning from Republican Sen.

The review process for the “next generation delivery vehicles” started in 2016, and electric vehicle advocates and Senate Democrats have warned that it would be a generational error and abandonment of Biden’s pledge to procure EVs for federal use, including by the USPS, to not have the contract exclusively purchase EVs.</td>

They declined to comment further.</td>

      <td>Everybody can agree that electricity grids should be more reliable. It will be much harder to agree on what price to pay for that safety.</td>
      <td>Can electricity grids be better prepared for extreme weather? Absolutely. The harder question is: How much are we willing to pay?<br />Grid reliability is getting more attention as extreme cold in Texas caused days of rolling blackouts for its residents. Last summer, a historic heat wave in California led to power shortages in the state. Many are left wondering how electricity grids, such an essential component of a functioning society, could be left so unprepared.<br />It is tempting to try to come up with a neat answer: A certain type of energy source might be to blame—whether wind, solar or natural gas—or the power market design might be responsible. Neither of these is satisfying on its own. A full autopsy will be required to figure out what exactly went wrong in Texas, but at a broad level the issue comes down to cost and risk assessment.<br />The decisions an American family has to make every year about health coverage aren’t all that different than the ones facing electricity planners. One family might prefer cheap insurance with less coverage, knowing full well that an emergency room visit will cost dearly. Another might prefer high fixed payments in exchange for peace of mind.<br />The electricity system is similar, and both Texas’ and California’s deregulated markets have little built-in insurance compared with others. Both are energy-only markets that rely on price signals to make sure enough power is on the grid. Other markets such as ISO-New England and PJM Interconnection, which covers 13 states and the District of Columbia, have capacity markets that offer power plants incentives to be on standby just in case the grid needs it. And then there are states with fully regulated markets where a utility owns or controls the total flow of electricity. In such a market, a utility has an incentive to invest as much as possible in the grid because it can raise the price it charges customers—as long as the state’s utilities commission approves.</td>

Saudi Arabia now issues an app-based health passport for those inoculated, while Iceland’s government is doling out vaccine passports to facilitate foreign travel. Last month, President Biden issued executive orders asking government agencies to assess the feasibility of creating digital Covid-19 vaccination certificates.<br />Proponents of the plans say they will enable battered economies to reopen, even as vaccines are still being rolled out, allowing people to enjoy leisure activities and go to work safe in the knowledge they aren’t harming others or at risk themselves. It could also act as an incentive for people to get the shot.<br />But the concept is potentially fraught with pitfalls. It could discriminate against minority communities, who are less likely to accept the vaccines, according to national surveys, or young people, who are less likely to be given priority to receive them. There are questions about the ethics of granting businesses access to peoples’ health records.</td>

The mortgage IPO boom, though, is petering out.<br />Last year was a banner season for the IPO market in general and public offerings for mortgage companies in particular. Between July and December, eight of the 30 largest U.S. mortgage lenders announced plans to go public.<br />It hasn’t worked out quite the way all the companies were hoping. Two lenders that have gone public this year,  Home Point Capital Inc.  and  loanDepot Inc.,  considerably scaled back their offerings. Another lender, AmeriHome Mortgage, abandoned its IPO plans and instead said it would sell to a bank. Shares of Caliber Home Loans Inc., which were expected to list in October, have yet to hit the public market.<br />“The average investor is not convinced a mortgage company is a great bet as far as owning stock in it,” said Guy Cecala, chief executive of Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research firm. “It’s a cyclical business, and they’re not sure what’s going to happen.”<br />With home prices soaring, many families are getting locked out of home buying—and some buyers who rushed in are regretting they did. Some of the borrowers who have been allowed to pause their mortgage payments during the pandemic will struggle to get back on track when their relief programs end. And slightly higher mortgage rates have weighed on refinance and purchase activity in recent weeks.</td>

      <td>Consumers are expected to step up spending after receiving stimulus payments and special jobless benefits</td>
      <td>U.S. households are getting a boost from pandemic-aid programs, priming the economy for a surge in growth this year.<br />The Commerce Department is set to report Friday on how much Americans earned and spent in January—key indicators of the economy’s health. Economists predict that consumer spending grew solidly last month while income soared, the latter by as much as 9.5%. Excluding last April when the first round of government aid reached households, such an increase in income would be the biggest on record dating back to 1959.<br />Under a $900 billion stimulus program signed by former President Donald Trump in late December, the federal government has been sending one-time cash payments of $600 to most households. It also has been paying jobless workers $300 a week on top of their normal unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, job growth resumed in January after a drop in December. And higher-income households, unable to travel or dine out, have built up a high level of savings.<br />“That combo will be quite powerful in driving consumer spending this year,” says Lydia Boussour, senior economist at Oxford Economics. She and her colleagues project that by this summer, U.S. output will have fully recovered from last year’s pandemic-related downturn, mainly because of a surge in consumer spending.<br />Oxford Economics predicts output will grow 7% this year, which would be the strongest growth in decades. In a Wall Street Journal poll earlier this month, economists on average expected gross domestic product to expand nearly 4.9% this year.</td>

The rollout of vaccines around the world will eventually tame high shipping costs, but even then the industry may fare better than in previous down cycles.<br />Shipping rates have skyrocketed since the middle of last year on strong demand from the developed world for personal protective equipment and stay-at-home goods, after the initial shock from Covid-19. As manufacturing powerhouse China has gotten the pandemic under control at home, its surging exports of electronic gadgets and masks have pushed up the cost of shipping them. Freight rates from North Asia to the west coast of North America have tripled from a year earlier, as assessed by S&P Global Platts. In contrast, rates for the other direction only rose 63%. The imbalance in trade led to a shortage of container boxes: Carriers were trying to return them, sometimes empty, to Asia.<br />The rush to move container boxes to the trans-Pacific route seems to have pushed up rates on some other routes, too. Freight rates from North Asia to North Europe have tripled since November. Port congestion caused by lockdowns and other pandemic-related restrictions have aggravated the problem.<br />Shipping company stocks are having a bumper year. Shares of  A.P. Moeller-Maersk ,  the world’s largest carrier, have gained 40% since the beginning of last year, while those of China’s Cosco Shipping have nearly tripled.<br />Shipping rates won’t stay elevated forever but may remain high for several months to come. As people are free to travel and eat out, the heightened demand for consumer goods will likely ease. But shipping companies will probably still emerge more resilient than in previous downturns.</td>

It would also be available to people who participate in aid programs such as reduced-price school meals, student Pell grants, Lifeline subsidies for telecom service and low-income or emergency pandemic programs from private broadband providers.  It offers up to a $50-a-month discount on broadband service, rising to $75 a month for households on tribal lands.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would support Donald Trump if GOP voters select him as the party’s nominee in 2024, the latest remarks from the Kentucky Republican on his stance toward the former president’s future in the party.<br />Asked Thursday on Fox News whether he would support Mr. Trump if that was whom Republican voters chose in 2024, Mr. McConnell said “the nominee of the party? Absolutely.” He also said “there’s a lot to happen between now and ‘24,” with at least four Republican senators he thinks are planning to run for president in addition to governors and others. Mr. McConnell didn’t identify the four members. GOP Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Marco Rubio of Florida are viewed by strategists, donors and lawmakers as potential candidates.<br />Mr. McConnell’s comments marked a contrast to the approach taken by Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.), the head of the House Republican Conference, towards Mr. Trump. Ms. Cheney voted to impeach Mr. Trump on a charge that he incited the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, stood by her decision, and earlier this week said “I don’t believe that he should be playing a role in the future of the party or the country.”<br />Mr. McConnell said earlier this month on the Senate floor, after the former president was acquitted, that Mr. Trump’s actions before the Jan. 6 riots were a dereliction of duty. He followed up with an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, saying “there is no question former President Trump bears moral responsibility.”<br />Mr. McConnell also was silent recently when some Republican senators criticized him for his harsh tone toward Mr. Trump. Similarly, he declined to comment after Mr. Trump called him a “dour, sullen and unsmiling political hack” and said, “The Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political ‘leaders’ like Sen. Mitch McConnell at its helm.”</td>

After that she released an EP, “Don’t Smile at Me” (2017), and went on tour in North America and Europe. The bulk of the film takes place between her 17th and 18th birthdays. When we meet her, Ms. Eilish is writing her first full-length album, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” (2019). By the end of the documentary, she will have won five Grammy Awards, including a sweep of the four major categories.</td>

Two days later the Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing about “disinformation and extremism” in conservative media. The only notable extremism on display was the majority party’s appetite for regulating and policing the free press.<br />Rep. Mike Doyle, chair of the subcommittee on communications and technology, declared in opening remarks that “it is the responsibility of this subcommittee to hold these institutions”—meaning press outlets he doesn’t like—“to a higher standard.” He said later that “more free speech just isn’t winning the day over the kind of speech we are concerned about.”<br />Democrats chose witnesses to lay the rhetorical foundation for press restrictions. One was Kristin Urquiza, whose father died of coronavirus and who spoke at the Democratic convention against Donald Trump. She said “the media didn’t pull the trigger” in her father’s death, “but they drove the getaway car,” because he watched and listened to news that downplayed the virus.</td>

      <td>AT&T Inc. agreed to sell a stake in its pay-TV unit to private-equity firm TPG and carve out the struggling business, pulling the telecom giant back from a costly wager on entertainment.<br />The transaction would move the DirecTV and AT&T TV services in the U.S. into a new entity that will be jointly run by the new partners. AT&T will retain a 70% stake in the business. TPG will pay $1.8 billion in cash for a 30% stake.<br />The deal values the new company at $16.25 billion with about $6.4 billion of debt. That is well below the $49 billion—about $66 billion including debt—that the Dallas company paid to buy international satellite operator DirecTV in 2015. AT&T recently struck $15.5 billion off the value of the unit, reflecting the service’s dimmer prospects.<br />AT&T said it would get about $7.8 billion in cash from the transaction to help pay down debts. Those proceeds include $5.8 billion that the new company will borrow from banks and pay back to AT&T.<br />AT&T will be able to stop including results from its U.S. video operations in its consolidated financial reports. The telecom company also agreed to cover up to $2.5 billion in losses tied to DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket package.</td>

      <td>The 10-year Treasury resumes its rise and stocks hit the skids.</td>
      <td>So much for Jerome Powell’s reassurances. Only a day after the Federal Reserve Chairman’s two-day, nothing-to-worry-about tour of Capitol Hill, financial markets suddenly found plenty to worry about on Thursday. Stocks fell sharply as the 10-year Treasury note yield had its largest one-day advance since November to its highest level in a year.<br />The 10-year Treasury is often called the world’s most important price, and it has moved up by some 58 basis points in about two months to a yield of 1.525%. The rapid move has caught markets by surprise. The Fed was supposed to be keeping long bond prices down for months if not years to come through its quantitative-easing bond purchases.<br />What does it mean? The sanguine interpretation is that bonds are merely signaling that markets are finally seeing the “sunlit uplands” of post-pandemic optimism, as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likes to put it. Growth means more risk-taking, and rising rates are often associated with economic recoveries and faster growth. By any normal historical standard, a 10-year yield of 1.525% is hardly something to be alarmed about.<br />There’s no doubt the economy is poised for a growth boom in 2021 as the pandemic eases. Pent-up savings by consumers and pent-up animal spirits are bound to be unleashed as the vaccine rollouts spread and lockdowns end.<br />That was certainly Mr. Powell’s view on Tuesday as he responded to Sen. Pat Toomey’s question about rising interest rates: “if you look at what the market is looking at, what markets are looking at, it’s a reopening economy with vaccination, it’s fiscal stimulus, it’s highly accommodated monetary policy, it’s savings accumulated on people’s balance sheets. It’s the expectations of much higher corporate profits, which matters a lot for the equity markets.”</td>

      <td>The songwriter and activist known as Joe Hill coined the phrase in a parody of a Salvation Army hymn</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />When President Biden signed executive orders last month addressing climate change, he insisted that his plan to wean the country from its dependence on fossil fuels would also create “new, good-paying jobs” for those working in affected industries. “These aren’t pie-in-the-sky dreams,” Mr. Biden said.<br />Critics of the administration’s policies were quick to use the same term to disagree. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, complained that “pie-in-the-sky government mandates and directives” would hurt energy security. This week, Politico quotedTerry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, as saying, “It’s pie in the sky bulls— about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.”<br />All of this “pie in the sky” talk has its origins in a satirical protest song written by a labor activist more than a century ago. The expression was coined by a Swedish immigrant to the U.S., born Joel Hägglund. He changed his name to Joe Hillstrom while working as an itinerant laborer and changed it again to Joe Hill as he became a popular songwriter for the labor movement.<br />Around 1910, Hill was working on the docks in San Pedro, Calif., and joined up with the Industrial Workers of the World, or IWW, a radical labor union whose members were dubbed the Wobblies. At the time, the IWW was organizing migrant workers who gathered on the “skid rows” of Western cities when they were between jobs. In those cities, the Wobblies often clashed with the Salvation Army, whose preachers proselytized from street-corner missions.</td>

      <td>The Democratic spending bill would put many out of business.</td>
      <td>Colleges for years have justified charging exorbitant tuition by offering what they claim is an immersive education. But many closed their campuses during the pandemic and didn’t discount tuition. Now Democrats plan to shower them with more money while punishing vocational schools.<br />Congress allocated colleges $14 billion from the Cares Act and $23 billion in the December relief bill on top of the $125 billion in federal student aid they soak up annually. The new $1.9 trillion bill would hand them another $40 billion regardless of whether they open or need the money. The December bill at least reduced aid to colleges with enormous endowments.<br />Democrats have also cut the share of money going to proprietary schools to 1% from 3%. For-profits will have to distribute 100% of their federal relief to students, which is fair enough. But nonprofit and public colleges only have to spend 50% on student aid. They can spend the rest on diversity coordinators and higher salaries for tenured professors.<br />The distinction between nonprofit and for-profit colleges is becoming increasingly tenuous. Four years of tuition at many nonprofits now costs more than a new home. Yet colleges aren’t accountable for student outcomes, and many graduate with enormous debt and degrees that don’t help them get high-paying jobs.<br />At least the pandemic forced some to tighten their belts. Consider the University of Southern California, which is trading its president’s colonial seven-acre estate for $24.5 million for a more modest $8.6 million mansion. Tough living. For-profit enrollment has shrunk by half over the last decade due to the Obama regulatory assault and improved job market. Several large chains have closed, and many surviving schools are small businesses that offer training in fields like welding, cybersecurity and nursing—skills in high demand.</td>

      <td>‘The pandemic changed everything,’ we say. But we have yet to absorb fully everything that means.</td>
      <td>New York<br />You can know something yet not fully absorb it. I think that’s happened with the pandemic. It is a year now since it settled into America and brought such damage—half a million dead, a nation in lockdown, a catastrophe for public schools. We keep saying “the pandemic changed everything,” but I’m not sure we understand the words we’re saying.<br />It will be decades before we fully appreciate what the pandemic did to us, and I mean our entire society—our culture, power structures, social ways, economic realities. We’ll see it more clearly when we look back from 2030 and 2040. A lot is not fully calculable now, and some problems haven’t presented themselves. One is going to be the profound psychological impact on some young people—how anxious and frightened this era will leave them, even how doom-laden. Kids 5 and 7 years old were trapped in a house surrounded by screens, and the screens said “germs” and “death” and “invisible carriers.” The pictures were of sobbing people on gurneys. We should be especially concerned about kids who are neglected and have no calm in the house, because they were left most exposed to the endless vibrations of the adults on the screens, and had no schools or teachers to help them.<br />But we’re in a transformational time. Some things that might have changed inch by inch over the next few decades were transformed in one large, incredible, 12-month shift. So many institutions will have to be nimble and farsighted now or they won’t survive. They’re going to have to be creative and generous and leave old intransigences behind. To lead in times like this will require the eyes of an artist who sees the broad shape of things, not an analyst who sees data points.<br />Look at the cities. I’m not sure we see the implications of what has happened there. In New York we are witnessing, for the first time in a century and a half, the collapse of the commuter model. You had to be in the magic metropolis if you were going to be in the top of your profession—finance, theater, law, whatever. Many couldn’t afford to live in the city because it’s where the top, moneyed people were, so they lived in the near-outside—New Jersey, Long Island, Connecticut. That is what my people did when they came to America a century ago, settling in Brooklyn and commuting to work as cooks and maids in the great houses of Manhattan.</td>

He has told contacts he used local connections to obtain the vaccines, some of these people said, and he has remained in the U.A.E. and is due to receive his second dose in coming weeks, they said.<br />Mr. Machin didn’t comment when reached by phone and email. A spokesman for CPPIB and Mr. Machin said that he had “deeply personal” reasons for traveling to the U.A.E. “I can assure you that zero influence was applied or sought to be applied” in order for him to obtain the vaccine, the spokesman said.<br />The CPPIB is a crown corporation, meaning it is governed independently from the federal government but is the steward of pension obligations that are government mandated. It reports to a board of directors, who are selected by Canada’s minister of finance.<br />A spokeswoman for Canada’s ministry of finance said that “while the CPPIB is an independent organization, this is very troubling. The federal government has been clear with Canadians that now is not the time to travel abroad. We were not made aware of this travel.”</td>

      <td>As many as eight million by our estimate, in part by gutting many of Clinton’s successful welfare reforms.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-relief package is being sold as an effort to “get America back to work.” It will do the opposite. We estimate that between five million and eight million fewer Americans will be employed over the next six months if the bill passes.<br />The bill would create one of the largest expansions in government welfare benefits since the birth of the modern welfare state. In combination with December’s $900 billion package, the new bill would expand the safety net to include six months of weekly $400 bonus unemployment benefits on top of the normal weekly benefits, a $3,000-a-child tax credit, an expansion of food stamps and rental assistance, $2,000-a-person checks, and expanded health benefits.<br />The Biden plan is welfare reform in reverse. It would repeal many of the successful work requirements dating to the Clinton era, and it contains only minimal requirements in exchange for its cash payments and other benefits.<br />There’s more. Unlike wages and salaries earned from work, many of these benefits are tax-free. So the after-tax equivalent of receiving a paycheck versus government benefits is even more tilted against working. There is no 7.65% payroll tax deducted from an unemployment check, as there would be on a paycheck. Unemployment benefits are subject to income taxes in most of the country, but six states don’t count them as taxable income.<br />In Kansas, a family of four with two unemployed adults who had earned U.S. median wages could get paid, including the Biden add-on package, the after-tax equivalent of more than $135,000 on an annual basis without working an hour. In Massachusetts, where state unemployment benefits are the highest in the nation, the figure is $170,000. This doesn’t include any housing or rental assistance the family may also receive. The Biden package of benefits would exceed the wages and salaries of at least 85% of households.</td>

      <td>Seeking to undermine Trump, Democrats, media and scientists made false and alarming claims.</td>
      <td>President Biden has proposed an “unprecedented” information campaign to persuade people to get Covid-19 vaccinations. Why, when a pandemic has killed 500,000 Americans, does the public need to be convinced? In part because Mr. Biden and his allies spent 2020 stoking fear for political reasons.<br />The Biden campaign and scientists allied with it impugned the Food and Drug Administration’s independence and integrity. Kamala Harris maligned President Trump’s claims about the speed of vaccine development and questioned its safety and effectiveness. New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo cast doubt on FDA evaluations of Covid-19 vaccines and said states should conduct their own reviews. An Aug. 27 letter from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asking governors for help setting up vaccine distribution elicited a statement from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer questioning the safety of the vaccines in development. Media “fact checkers” said rapid vaccine development would take a “miracle.”<br />Between April 1-14 and Nov. 25-Dec. 8 the share of Americans who told pollsters they were likely to consent to vaccination declined from 74% to 56%, even though  Pfizer  and Moderna released strong vaccine safety and effectiveness results prior to the second survey. The decline occurred in both sexes and all age groups, education levels and racial groups. Many medical workers, including nursing-home staff, are also hesitant to be vaccinated.<br />Medical authorities were complicit in stoking these fears. Although June FDA guidance confirmed the agency wouldn’t “cut corners” and that expedited development would proceed “without sacrificing our standards for quality, safety, and efficacy,” a Sept. 10 editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association claimed that “some” were concerned that political appointees would “insist” on authorizing a vaccine “over the recommendation of FDA career scientists.” The concerned “some” were never named, and no citation was given.<br />The editorial claimed FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn had “indicated that the FDA is willing to use an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for vaccines before phase 3 trials are complete.” It cited an Aug. 7 JAMA article by three FDA officials including Dr. Hahn and Peter Marks, head of the FDA center responsible for vaccine reviews. In fact, that article, titled “Unwavering Regulatory Safeguards for COVID-19 Vaccines,” didn’t signal a loosening of standards. It committed to issuing an EUA only once clinical trials demonstrate safety and effectiveness, which FDA guidance indicated could be based on final analysis of a phase 3 trial or on interim analysis of such a trial that met specified success and safety criteria and after public discussion at the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.</td>

      <td>It’s a February morning, and the man with the most famous name in professional golf is behind the wheel of his car. He has long been regarded not only for his prodigious talent, but also for a distant, obsessed personality that has made many of his fellow pros say they don’t really know him.<br />Before the morning is over, a gruesome automobile accident will have shattered his body and caused his fans to wonder not only if he will ever play golf again, but if he will ever walk again.<br />It was 1949, the golfer was Ben Hogan, and what happened next remains one of the most implausible and thrilling stories in sports history. When Tiger Woods crashed his car this week, the news flashed instantly from screen to screen; Hogan’s accident took place just before the television era, never mind the internet, and word traveled more slowly. But headline writers assumed they were describing the end of a brilliant career.<br />Hogan and his wife, Valerie, were returning from the Phoenix Open. At 36, he was the holder of a U.S. Open title and two PGA championships. His future seemed limitless. En route to their home in Fort Worth, Texas, they were on a narrow highway when a Greyhound bus coming from the other direction tried to pass a truck.<br />Hogan, knowing the bus was about to strike his car head-on, threw his body over his wife’s in the passenger seat to protect her. She would later say, “It’s a good thing he did, because the engine of our car was tossed back into the seat and the steering column was shoved through the driver’s seat and into the back.” Hogan’s injuries were devastating: his pelvis broken in two places, his collarbone shattered, his ankle fractured, his ribs chipped and blood clots forming.

      <td>Like others in the black community, I was hesitant. Then I did my research.</td>
      <td>Like many African-Americans, I had a great deal of trepidation about the Covid-19 vaccine. But last week my wife and I completed our course of vaccinations. My experience as a pastor and leader in the black community led me to believe it was the right thing to do.<br />Opinion polls show that African-Americans have the greatest hesitation of any group about the Covid vaccine. These reservations are rooted in centuries of mistreatment as well as illegal and unethical experimentation by the nation’s medical establishment. In the 19th century James Marion Sims, the man regarded as the father of modern gynecology, conducted scores of experiments on enslaved women without anesthesia. The notorious “Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male” continued into the 1970s.<br />Outcomes in health care also aren’t encouraging. African-Americans have twice the infant-mortality rate of whites. African-American women are more than three times as likely as their white counterparts to die from pregnancy-related causes. The breast-cancer mortality rate is 42% higher for black women than for white women. My father died when I was only 16, thanks largely to misdiagnosed and mistreated hypertension. Disturbing news accounts of disparate treatment in American health-care facilities have emerged during the pandemic.<br />Unfounded rumors about an attempt to use the vaccine to wipe out the black community have gained currency among my fellow African-Americans. I understand the general mistrust, but the painful truth is that blacks need the vaccine more than anyone. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says we are nearly three times as likely as whites to die from Covid.<br />As a minister, I have witnessed these deaths personally. I have buried many friends and church members. At the peak of the pandemic, I regularly received reports of two or three deaths each day. I have struggled to console and counsel their survivors, most of whom couldn’t be in the same room with their loved ones as they took their last breaths. Over the weekend, I lost an old friend and colleague to the virus. But I believe that the God who brought us through slavery, Jim Crow, the Spanish flu and lynchings can steer us through this crisis as well.</td>

      <td>The Lindbergh baby was only the most high-proﬁle victim of an ‘epidemic’ of abductions in 1930s America.</td>
      <td>Decades before actor Kevin McCarthy had his big-screen encounter with the pod people of Santa Mira, Calif., America suffered from an invasion of real-life body snatchers.<br />Through the Jazz Age and the Depression, mobsters and copycat amateurs captured rich and prominent people or their children and held them for ransom. Most of the victims were freed unharmed, often for a million dollars or more in today’s money. But in the most notorious case—the kidnapping of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh’s 20-month-old Charlie from their home in New Jersey—the baby was long dead during the endless negotiations for his release.<br />That case prompted the passage of the “Lindbergh Law”—the Federal Kidnapping Act of 1932—enabling the U.S. government to get involved and giving J. Edgar Hoover, the head of the FBI, a boost in his insatiable quest for fame. Even so, the epidemic of kidnapping, as the papers called it, stubbornly persisted through the 1930s and into our times. Frank Sinatra’s 19-year-old son Frank Jr. was grabbed at Harrah’s Lake Tahoe in 1963 and, a decade later, the radical Symbionese Liberation Army snatched the publishing heiress Patty Hearst.<br />The kidnappings of the ’30s seem almost quaint compared to the school massacres, drive-by shootings, cyberhacks, radical rioting, pressure-cooker bombings and other grim crimes of today. But they were terrifying in their era. The New York Times began publishing a kidnapping log. Behind the gates of their mansions, rich people quaked for their lives. They hired armed chauffeurs and slept with shotguns and pistols at their bedsides. J.P. Morgan enlisted 250 armed guards for its partners and their families.<br />In “The Snatch Racket,” Carolyn Cox, a veteran Washington lawyer and law professor, reanimates this intriguing slice of American life. Crisp, zesty and free of the clichés of most true-crime writing, Ms. Cox’s book interweaves her case narratives with the inside story of how Hoover exploited the crisis to launch a “crusade” against organized crime, even coining the term “G-men” to glamorize his agents.</td>

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>

Iran has said it is pursuing a nuclear-energy program, but has denied it is seeking to build weapons.<br />The call took place as the White House works to recalibrate its relationship with Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the importance of human rights and stressing accountability for Mr. Khashoggi’s death.</td>

After Mr. Biden’s faulty diagnosis and treatment plan for the economy, now it seems that some members of his party don’t even want to trust him with nuclear weapons.<br />The news of the day is rising prosperity. The Journal’s John McCormickreports:<br />Also today, the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew a little faster than it initially thought in the fourth quarter of 2020. Turns out that the Biden “inheritance” from predecessor Donald Trump was a strong 4.1% annual rate of real economic growth in our 45th president’s last full quarter in office.<br />The news is also getting better for workers. The Journal’s Eric Morath reports:<br />In and out of government, just about everyone seems to have noticed that the economy is much stronger than our president understands.

      <td>Clogged ports and full freezers are snarling the flow of seafood to American dinner plates, boosting costs for fish suppliers and consumers.<br />A flood of imports, and workforces diminished by Covid-19, have caused backlogs at major U.S. ports, stranding containers of frozen fish on ships and docks in places like California and New Jersey.  Freezers in key port cities are also filling up, often leaving seafood with nowhere to go once it is unloaded, and prompting importers to shuttle fish between warehouses or across longer distances to find cold storage.<br />Those bottlenecks are running up against Lent, when many Christians abstain from meat and Americans eat more seafood than during any other time of year, retail data show. Most seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported, and soaring transportation and logistics costs are erasing profits on some container loads of fish. Higher costs are rippling through the supply chain, executives said, helping push up seafood prices for consumers alongside other rising food costs.<br />Kim Gorton, chief executive of Boston-based seafood supplier Slade Gorton & Co., said importers have had containers of seafood stuck at ports for up to three weeks, with related storage charges eating up profit on the fish in days. Her company has had varieties like shrimp and cod held up for days, and she has had to ferry loads of salmon between freezers to make room for other shipments.<br />“The entire system is seized up,” Ms. Gorton said. “A lot of us are basically driving product around to find if there is any room at the inn.”</td>

The rising cost of longer-term borrowing has rattled many investors, but over recent days Fed officials have shrugged off higher Treasury yields and attributed the bond market’s shift toward higher borrowing costs to expectations for an improving economy.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The House voted 224 to 206 Thursday on legislation to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, an expansive effort that has spurred fierce opposition among conservatives over religious freedom and set off a new round of partisan fighting in Congress.<br />The measure, known as the Equality Act, marks a major plank of what Democrats term their equality agenda, following earlier laws treating attacks against gay people as hate crimes and allowing gay people to serve openly in the military. The Equality Act would amend the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination based on race, religion, sex and other characteristics, to include sexual orientation and gender identity.<br />“It is needed because there is discrimination against people in the LGBTQ community,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said on Thursday. “It breaks my heart that it is necessary,” she said, choking up a press conference.<br />The White House supports the legislation but its fate in the Senate is uncertain. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on Thursday declined to say when he would schedule the measure for a vote.<br />In a press conference with the Capitol as a backdrop and later on the House floor, Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus denounced the legislation, saying that it would discriminate against certain adoption agencies that don’t allow adoptions by same-sex parents, undermine women’s sports, and block healthcare providers from declining to perform abortions on the basis of their religious beliefs.</td>

      <td>Lovers of large-scale musicals have been feeling more than usually deprived by the Covid-19 pandemic. In theory, it shouldn’t be impossible to webcast a musical, but it’s technically very difficult—too many people, too much stuff going on—and the only one I’ve reviewed, the Irish Repertory Theatre’s wonderful revival of “Meet Me in St. Louis,” was a scaled-down version in which the actors “phoned in” their performances, taping them from their separate homes, after which they were edited together in the studio. So it is inspiring to report that Virginia’s Signature Theatre, one of the top American regional theaters that specialize in musicals, is webcasting “Simply Sondheim,” a fully-staged 33-song revue directed and choreographed by Matthew Gardiner and performed in the company’s empty 275-seat theater by 12 singers and a 15-player pit orchestra. No, it’s not “Sweeney Todd” on a Broadway-sized stage, but it is fabulously fine in its own right and comes across with irrepressible vitality on a small screen.<br />Signature Theatre’s imaginative revivals of the musicals of Stephen Sondheim have given the company a well-deserved national reputation for excellence. That said, I wasn’t expecting “Simply Sondheim” to be quite as good as it is, since greatest-hits musical revues too often feel aimless. Not this one: Mr. Gardiner’s scenery-free staging, in which the songs are locked together without benefit of plot or connective narration, moves from number to number so quickly that you scarcely have time to catch your breath. “Simply Sondheim” has no dead spots, no slack patches, no weak moments of any kind: Every element of the show is exactly right, including Justin Chiet’s cinematography and the clean, precise playing of the orchestra, which brings out the myriad subtleties of Jonathan Tunick’s original orchestrations.<br />Everyone in the cast is so fine that I’m reluctant to single out any individual member for particular praise. Still, I mustn’t fail to mention Tracy Lynn Olivera, who charges through “Getting Married Today,” the fastest and most notoriously complex of Mr. Sondheim’s tongue-twisting patter songs, in such a way as to make you wonder why her performance didn’t set off a sonic boom in the theater. And that’s not the best part: Ms. Olivera acts the lyrics instead of just tossing them off, thus making the song not merely funny but also moving.<br />Trust me when I tell you, though, that every performer and every performance in “Simply Sondheim” lands squarely on target. (O.K., one more special mention: Norm Lewis sings “Being Alive” with extreme sensitivity.) I would have gladly paid to see this show in the theater, and Signature Theatre should give serious thought to remounting it when the pandemic is over. It deserves real, in-person applause.<br /></td>
