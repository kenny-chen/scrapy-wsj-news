      <td>MEXICO CITY—Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Sunday that he tested positive for Covid-19 and was receiving medical treatment for what he called mild symptoms.<br />Mr. López Obrador, 67 years old, has continued traveling around the country and attending public events even during a surge of Covid-19 infections hit the country over the past month. Mexico has suffered close to 150,000 confirmed Covid-19 deaths.<br />“As always, I’m optimistic,” he said in a tweet. “We’ll all get through this.”<br />Mr. López Obrador said that he still intends to hold a telephone call Monday morning with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to discuss Mexico’s possible acquisition of Russia’s Sputnik V Covid vaccines.<br />Mr. López Obrador said he would be keeping an eye on government matters from the National Palace in Mexico City, where he lives and conducts most of his duties. Interior Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero will preside over his morning news conferences in the meantime. Mexico doesn’t have a vice president who would formally take over duties if the president falls ill.</td>

It sets up a matchup between the last two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl. One is the greatest quarterback of his generation. The other is the greatest quarterback of the next one.<br />It was just two years ago that Brady and Mahomes met in the AFC Championship, but that was a lifetime in NFL years. Brady was a New England Patriot back then, and Mahomes was in his first season as a starting quarterback. The Patriots won that thriller in overtime on their way to their sixth Super Bowl title.<br />Everything changed over the next year—and quickly. Mahomes and the Chiefs won it all the next year. Brady and the Patriots bowed out quickly and quietly. Brady, after two decades in New England, decided to go to Tampa Bay.</td>

The company is backed by  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  and competes with ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese company behind TikTok.<br />With a minimum deal size of $4.95 billion, the IPO would be the largest in the world since late 2019, when state-controlled Saudi Arabian Oil Co., commonly known as Aramco, raised $29.4 billion, Dealogic figures show. It would also be the largest in Hong Kong since  Budweiser Brewing Co.

It plans to fix the offer price on Jan. 29. At the top of the range, the deal implies a market capitalization of $60.9 billion.<br />The offering size could increase to up to $6.2 billion after underwriting banks exercise an option to sell 15% more shares.</td>

      <td>The monumental decision to have a child got even more complicated in the past year—here’s why some are still making the effort</td>
      <td>It’s a strange moment to bring a baby into the world.<br />The pandemic has changed much of what it once meant to be expecting: a partner holding your hand through an ultrasound appointment, crowded baby showers and unsolicited advice from hovering strangers in the supermarket, family flying in to meet a new grandchild in the hospital.<br />The constant threat of the virus has made our health feel precarious, and pregnant women are at higher risk for severe disease if they become infected. Much of the country is either struggling financially or bracing for economic impact. A Brookings Institution report projected there will be about 300,000 fewer births in 2021, an 8% drop from 2019.<br />And yet, about a year into the pandemic, many would-be parents say they’ve grown tired of waiting. Some paused fertility treatments in the spring only to realize Covid wasn’t going to disappear in a matter of months. For others, Covid was the push: the sign they needed to slow down and focus on life at home. Or the pandemic brought the silver lining of flexibility—remote work, canceled business travel—that made having a baby possible.<br />“Everything was kind of home-centered, with work and school,” says Landon Faulkner, whose wife, Kyra Faulkner, is due in February. “In some ways, it seemed even easier.”</td>

      <td>The 43-year-old Brady advances to his 10th NFL title game after a 31-26 win over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship</td>
      <td>There were bombs, shocking interceptions, and two critical fourth down decisions that swung the balances in this NFC Championship between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Green Bay Packers. There was an electrifying duel featuring the most successful quarterback of all-time and the one who was the best in the entire NFL this year. The finish was a frenzy.<br />It ended in a familiar way, albeit in unfamiliar colors. Brady is headed to his 10th Super Bowl, and his first with Tampa Bay, after the Buccaneers topped the Packers 31-26. The win makes the Buccaneers the first team in NFL history to play the Super Bowl on its home field, with the game taking place at their Raymond James Stadium on Feb. 7.<br />The Buccaneers didn’t just win. They withstood a late charge by the No. 1 seed in the NFC, which was led by the presumptive Most Valuable Player, quarterback Aaron Rodgers, at Lambeau Field. After Tampa Bay raced out to a 28-10 lead, Green Bay closed it to 28-23. Brady, at one point, threw interceptions on three consecutive possessions.<br />It was an improbable series of events that gave Tampa Bay such a commanding lead in the first place. There was an unusual mistake by Rodgers, an unexpected fourth-down call and then an unlikely play by Brady.<br />With less than a minute left in the first half, with Tampa Bay ahead just 14-10, Rodgers threw a pick—just his sixth of the season. And with under a minute to play, Brady pressed down field until his team faced fourth and 4 from the Green Bay 45-yard-line. They went for it. They got it. And on the next play, Brady threw a 39-yard touchdown to Scotty Miller.</td>

      <td>Biden should keep Trump’s last-minute executive order making regulation more accountable.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s team is understandably skeptical of “midnight” executive actions issued during President Trump’s final weeks, but one order, issued Jan. 18, is as valuable in reinforcing democratic accountability as it is constitutionally necessary. It is in Mr. Biden’s interest to strengthen it, not reflexively withdraw it.<br />The Executive Order on Ensuring Democratic Accountability in Agency Rulemaking provides that only democratically accountable agency officials may issue regulations. This means that new regulations will have to conform to the new president’s priorities and not simply those of career employees. Reversing this order could be very costly and destabilizing to Mr. Biden’s agenda, including in ways that aren’t obvious.<br />The order does more than the usual moratorium on agency rule making that new presidents impose until their own appointees can review pending rules. It would also insulate all Biden administration regulations from a potent constitutional challenge. That’s because rule making by agency employees flatly violates the Constitution’s Appointments Clause.<br />In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Supreme Court held that rule making is a significant government power that may be exercised only by officers appointed in accordance with that clause. More recent court decisions such as Edmond v. United States (1997) support the conclusion that only principal agency officers (like department heads and assistant secretaries confirmed by the Senate) may issue regulations that have the force of law and can’t be amended without another rule-making procedure.<br />Compliance with constitutional rule-making requirements has been inconsistent, undermining both democratic accountability and—because improperly issued rules are subject to legal challenge—agencies’ own agendas. This is no small problem. We broke the news on these pages nearly three years ago that hundreds of Food and Drug Administration rules were illegal because they had been issued by career staff. Subsequent Pacific Legal Foundation research on the Health and Human Services Department’s rule-making practices from 2001 to 2017 revealed that 1,860 FDA final rules (98% of the total) had been issued illegally and that other HHS agencies had similar problems.</td>

      <td>Both left and right want to regulate social media, but their ‘fixes’ would break the web.</td>
      <td>Ding dong, he’s gone, but Donald Trump’s bans from  Facebook ,   Twitter ,  Google, Reddit, Snapchat, Grindr (wait, what?),  Pinterest ,  TikTok and others mostly persist. Don’t bans on Mr. Trump and others violate the First Amendment? Actually, it’s private companies invoking their own First Amendment right to bar things they don’t like. But even Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called it “a failure.” That’s also true of Parler’s decapitation. Never mind that these actions seem partisan and hypocritical; the bans will continue until morale improves. Democrats may cheer but the precedent is scary—soon they’ll be silencing their own. Vive la guillotine electronique.<br />Expect the siren calls for regulation to become deafening—mostly focused on “updating” Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, the provision that limits social-media companies’ liability for things users say. A year ago Joe Biden said it should be “revoked, immediately.” The law states that except for illegal materials like child pornography, companies can host everything and employ their own community standards to take down what they consider offensive.<br />This mess was all predicted by a comic strip (really!) in 2004, when only Harvard dorm residents knew about TheFacebook—and Twitter was two years away. John “Gabe” Gabriel—the alter ego of one of the creators of Penny Arcade, a web comic—came up with the Greater Internet [Jerkwad] Theory (obscenity deleted). The theory is spelled out on a green chalkboard: “Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total [Jerkwad]” while interpreters note that “normal, well-adjusted people may display psychopathic or antisocial behaviors when given both anonymity and a captive audience on the Internet.” It’s no longer a theory, is it?<br />In our new slushy, snowflake-soaked society, some folks are offended by just about anything, and are quick to deploy torches and pitchforks to silence and cancel anything not currently considered politically correct. It’s worth reiterating: social media and all its benefits (ask small businesses) wouldn’t exist without Section 230. Instead of hiring hundreds of thousands of coders, Facebook and Twitter would instead be giant law firms forever fighting lawsuits.<br />Still, Facebook ran ads all fall practically begging for regulation. But any attempt to “fix” Section 230 would surely kill it. Legislation would be a bicameral camel—a horse designed by committee—trying to define community standards, hate speech, what “incites” riots, what constitutes “systemic” racism and on and on, with the inevitable loopholes for certain politicians and favored groups.</td>

      <td>Federalism is again proving its value in getting shots in arms.</td>
      <td>President Biden is vowing to meet a goal of 100 million Covid-19 vaccines in 100 days, and if anything that is too modest given the pace of production. One way to do better is to heed lessons in flexibility from the states with the most successful vaccine rollouts.<br />Some six weeks after the first shipments, the U.S. has administered some 53% of distributed vaccines. The gap continues to grow between states that are getting shots into arms, and those arguing over who gets what and when. North Dakota had administered some 84% of its supply as of Jan. 23, and West Virginia about 83%—far better than states like California (45%) or Alabama (47%). Federalism is showing what works—and what doesn’t.<br />The federal government’s main role is the production and distribution of vaccine doses, and the Biden Administration is fortunate to inherit Operation Warp Speed. Mr. Biden says he’ll trigger the Defense Production Act to expand vaccine production, albeit without details on how he’d build on the existing plan.<br />One step forward would be to approve the  AstraZeneca  vaccine on an emergency basis, as the U.K. did last month. It may not prove as effective as the mRNA shots from  Pfizer  and Moderna, but it would add to supply, is easier to transport, and would be a particularly good candidate for younger, healthy Americans.<br />The risk is that Team Biden tries to micromanage state administration of the vaccine, especially now that the media, Democrats and some public-health officials are blaming slow state rollouts on a “vacuum” of federal leadership. But vaccine administration was always intended to be state-led, and too many jurisdictions squandered the ample time they had for preparation.</td>

      <td>She’s never explained her needless snooping on Michael Flynn.</td>
      <td>Presidents deserve the advisers they choose absent significant cause. In the case of Joe Biden’s choice to lead the U.S. Agency for International Development, Samantha Power, one question to ask is how honest she was about her role in snooping on Michael Flynn.<br />In late 2016 Mr. Flynn was the incoming national security adviser for Donald Trump. Mr. Flynn’s conversation with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. was recorded by U.S. spooks, and his name leaked after being “unmasked” by several figures in the Obama Administration. Who did the leaking—a felony—has never been solved. But the leak fed the media fires over Mr. Trump’s alleged collusion with the Russians, and Mr. Flynn was unjustly prosecuted.<br />At the time Ms. Power was U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. She was a political appointee and not an intelligence professional. Yet Congress looked into it and found that over her last year in office Ms. Power had unmasked nearly 300 people, without any concrete explanation of why she needed this information.<br />During an Oct. 13, 2017, appearance before the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) asked her directly about the unmasking and leaking of Gen. Flynn’s name. “I did want to get you on the record,” he told her. Ms. Power categorically denied she leaked his name—or any classified information.<br />She was fuzzier about unmasking. “I have no recollection of making a request related to General Flynn,” she replied. Then again, maybe she had reason to be fuzzy.</td>

      <td>The state party reveals the divisions that could doom the GOP for years.</td>
      <td>Republicans lost Arizona in the November presidential race for the first time since 1996, and they have lost three U.S. Senate races in a row. How to respond? Naturally, Arizona’s Republican Party decided on the weekend to censure three of its most prominent . . . fellow Republicans.<br />The state party’s committee members, led by chairwoman Kelli Ward, passed resolutions rebuking Cindy McCain, the widow of former Sen. John McCain; former Sen. Jeff Flake; and even current Gov. Doug Ducey. The first two offended the members by endorsing Joe Biden over Donald Trump for President. Mr. Ducey’s offense is that he introduced pandemic lockdowns—though they were relatively modest compared to those in much of the country.<br />The resolutions have little practical effect, but they symbolize the party divisions that could doom the GOP to minority status nationwide for years. Ms. Ward, who has run twice for Senate and lost, was endorsed for party chair this past week by Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, now decamped to Mar-a-Lago, is contemplating revenge against everyone in the GOP he blames for his defeat.<br />Sensible parties that lose elections try to reunite in opposition even while they debate policy differences and examine why they lost. They don’t excommunicate people who could help rebuild a majority. Mr. Flake and Ms. McCain found Mr. Trump’s behavior as President unacceptable, but they were hardly alone. Mr. Trump didn’t lose because Republicans betrayed him. He lost because he alienated too many voters in Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona who liked his policies but disliked his tumultuous leadership.<br />The attack on Mr. Ducey is simply bizarre. The Governor has a strong conservative record and will finish his second term in 2022. Senate Republicans have been hoping to recruit him to run against newly elected Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who must run again in 2022 because he is filling former Sen. McCain’s uncompleted term.</td>

      <td>Some blamed the mayhem on the pandemic, but persistent cop-bashing emboldened criminals.</td>
      <td>The year 2020 likely saw the largest percentage increase in homicides in American history. Murder was up nearly 37% in a sample of 57 large and medium-size cities. Based on preliminary estimates, at least 2,000 more Americans, most of them black, were killed in 2020 than in 2019. Mainstream media and many politicians claim the pandemic caused this bloodbath, but the chronology doesn’t support that assertion. And now the criminal-justice policies supported by President Biden promise to exacerbate the current crime wave, while ignoring its actual causes.<br />The local murder increases in 2020 were startling: 95% in Milwaukee, 78% in Louisville, Ky., 74% in Seattle, 72% in Minneapolis, 62% in New Orleans, and 58% in Atlanta, according to data compiled by crime analyst Jeff Asher. Dozens of children, overwhelmingly black, were killed in drive-by shootings. They were slain in their beds, living rooms and strollers. They were struck down at barbecues, in their yards, in malls, in their parents’ cars, and at birthday parties. Fifty-five children were killed in Chicago in 2020, 17 in St. Louis, and 11 in Philadelphia. In South Los Angeles alone, 40 children were shot, some non-lethally, through September.<br />Why this mayhem? The St. Louis Post-Dispatch expresses the conventional wisdom: because of the “economic, civic and interpersonal stress” from the coronavirus pandemic. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot blamed pandemic-related “frustration, anger . . . trauma and mental health challenges.” But crime fell during the first months of the pandemic shutdowns, both in the U.S. and globally. Only at the end of May did that trend reverse itself, and only in the U.S., thanks to a surge in drive-by shootings.<br />Eighteen people were murdered in Chicago on May 31—the city’s most violent day in six decades, according to University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell. Other American cities saw similar spikes in mayhem, all tied to the street violence unleashed by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. The political and media response to Floyd’s death amplified the existing narrative that policing was lethally racist. The ensuing riots received little condemnation from Democratic leaders and a weak response from the criminal-justice system.<br />Cops now face a poisonous environment. Since the summer, they have been shot in the head, firebombed and assaulted with lethal projectiles. An officer providing first aid at a crime scene may be met with a hail of rocks and bottles. Resistance is now the norm. Officers believe they face a political and legal environment that is eager to sacrifice them in the name of racial justice.</td>

      <td>‘The famous and notorious alike are given the chance, with America tuned in, to defend a life’s reputation.’</td>
      <td>From Tunku Varadarajan’s review of CNN’s “Larry King Live” in the Journal, Oct. 25, 2002. King died Saturday at 87:<br /><br />It would be easy to accuse Mr. King of flacking for every scoundrel who provides the crowd-pleasing humiliation that keeps ratings healthy—or for every worthy who’s written a book and wants to clear his throat on air about it. Some might believe that his program is morally questionable, but entertaining. . . . In fact, it’s often quite the opposite: hugely dull, but morally sound, in that it offers a worthy democratic service, giving the popularly reviled members of society—shoplifting actresses, allegedly homicidal pols and even nonwealthy, nonpowerful criminal suspects—an opportunity to face their accusers, as it were, with equal viewership. . . .<br />True, the very wealthy and privileged are held to a higher standard of social comportment, as they should be. But often Mr. King—by serving as a blank slate, like a good psychiatrist—gives them a valuable opportunity to make a full confession with their own ill-chosen words. And sometimes the benefit of a “Larry King Live” appearance is ambiguous (as with the parents of JonBenet Ramsey, or Susan McDougal). The important point is that the famous and notorious alike are given the chance, with America tuned in, to defend a life’s reputation, or to lessen the damage of their 15 minutes of fame.<br />Can this be such a bad thing?</td>

      <td>Step one is to increase the number of H-2 guest-worker visas for Central Americans.</td>
      <td>Some 8,000 Honduran asylum seekers tried to get up a welcoming party of sorts for President Joe Biden this month. Their effort to reach the U.S. southern border in at least two caravans was repelled thanks to agreements that President Trump made with Mexico and Guatemala to use force to intercept illegal aliens. But Central America remains a simmering cauldron of would-be migrants desperate to work in the U.S.<br />Mr. Biden now has to come up with his own strategy. More resources at the border to process applicants could help. But without new incentives for migrants to follow the law, the U.S. will remain heavily dependent on the militarization of immigration policy in Guatemala and Mexico to contain the inevitable flows of illegal aliens.<br />The Hondurans seem to have concluded logically that with the Democrats in power again, Trump-era restrictions on asylum were sure to be lifted. Yet on Jan. 17 NBC News reported that a senior Biden transition official said its message to the migrants was that this “is not the time to make the journey.” That same official also said they “need to understand they’re not going to be able to come into the United States immediately.”<br />Nice words of warning did nothing to discourage the migrants who had set out on Jan. 15. By Jan. 18 they were engaged in violent confrontations with Guatemalan National Guard and national police. Mothers in tears sat on the ground holding their children while young men blocked roads, threw stones, and tried to push their way past law enforcement.<br />Reports from the front say that thousands were turned back. My sources say the rest have broken into smaller groups that continue to move north. The White House said over the weekend that Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador—known as AMLO—has agreed to keeping working to “curb the flow” of illegal aliens from Central America in Mexico. If they make it to the U.S. border the Biden administration has warned that processing priority will go to those already waiting in the asylum queue.</td>

      <td>A sit-down strike at General Motors outraged Alfred Sloan, the company’s president. As days turned into weeks, he decided to make a deal.</td>
      <td>Here’s a remarkable fact: In 1980 the median income for young workers in Flint, Mich., was higher than in San Francisco. Flint was a company town, and as Edward McClelland says in “Midnight in Vehicle City”: “There was never a better time to work for General Motors.”<br />Who could disagree? Employees at GM and the other big auto makers had cost-of-living adjustments, two cars in their driveways, lifetime health care and a pension. In Michigan, they had summer cottages and deer hunting trips Up North.<br />It all arose, so Mr. McClelland posits, from a 1936-37 sit-down strike when auto workers in Flint struck GM and demanded bargaining recognition for the fledgling United Auto Workers of America.<br />The strike lasted 44 days. It was violent on both sides but turned into a standoff in which the UAW refused to call an end until it won exclusive bargaining rights, and GM refused to talk until the workers left its premises.<br />Mr. McClelland tells the story of those tension-filled days, when strikers armed with car-door hinges and homemade blackjacks fended off tear gas and the Flint police. According to the book’s subtitle, Flint was “the strike that created the middle class.” The author, a journalist and historian from Lansing, barely bothers to substantiate that claim, but his chronicle of the strike is compelling.</td>

But, they said, it doesn’t mean the contagion can’t be contained.<br />“We’re living in a world where coronavirus is so prevalent and rapidly mutating that there are going to be new variants that pop up,” Anthony Harnden, a physician who advises the U.K. government, told Sky News. “We may well be in a situation where we end up having to have an annual coronavirus vaccine” to cope with emerging strains.<br />As the new variant in the U.K. has spread across the country, hospitals have been under more strain than they were in the first wave of the pandemic in the spring, and the national Covid-19 death toll is expected to surpass 100,000 in coming days. But in the week ended Sunday, new daily cases were down 22% from the previous seven days.<br />Matt Hancock, the U.K.’s health secretary, said that was because of national restrictions in place since the start of the year. But in a television interview, Mr. Hancock warned, “We are a long, long, long way” before cases would be low enough for restrictions to be lifted.</td>

      <td>Your editorial “Biden’s First Spending Blowout” (Jan. 16) is absolutely right. I agree that more must be done to support those whose livelihoods have been ripped apart due to the pandemic, but President Biden’s proposal goes far beyond that. His plan is filled with progressive pipe dreams and wasteful spending. We ought to be working on solutions that provide targeted relief and deal directly with the horrific economic and health impact of Covid-19. Unfortunately, his plan is more focused on using the pandemic to push harmful liberal priorities.<br />The most egregious example is the Democrats’ proposal to spend $350 billion in taxpayer money to bail out states like New York and Illinois. This is an insult to taxpayers in fiscally responsible states. The Democrats are prioritizing bailouts for failed politicians in mismanaged states over helping small businesses or speeding up vaccine distribution.<br />Congress has already allocated more than $4.5 trillion to address this crisis, including $900 billion four weeks ago. The states have received an enormous amount of relief funding in the last 30 days alone and we still don’t know how much money remains unspent. Let’s give the states time to use these dollars and see if they actually have unmet needs.<br />Since the beginning, I’ve said Congress’s efforts should be strategic, focusing on families and small businesses in need.<br />If President Biden wants to work with Congress to pass legislation that actually helps Americans, he’s better off going back to the drawing board and ditching his liberal dreams for real solutions that keep businesses open, the economy growing and families healthy.</td>

Hours after the U.S. issued a statement Saturday evening in Washington calling on China to cease intimidation, Taipei reported that Beijing sent more flights on Sunday.<br />The Chinese military flights coincided with U.S. naval maneuvers in the nearby South China Sea, which an American aircraft-carrier strike group entered on Saturday to conduct security operations and combat drills.<br />China sent strategic bombers, jet fighters and a turboprop on 13 sorties into Taiwan’s southwestern air-defense identification zone on Saturday and followed up with 15 fighter and turboprop sorties into roughly the same area the next day, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. On both days, the Taiwanese military responded by deploying aircraft, issuing radio warnings and tracking the Chinese planes with air-defense missile systems, the ministry said.<br />Earlier in the week, Mr. Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Washington would continue to ensure Taiwan could defend itself, as required by a U.S. law governing unofficial relations with the island, while Taiwan’s de facto envoy attended Mr. Biden’s inauguration after a formal invitation.

It’s not something that happens naturally if you like what you do and you’re good at it. You have to set time limits for yourself.” You also have to know what your purpose is after you retire or “you go into this void that’s really very tough,” she adds. Leaving the C-suite was one of the hardest things she’s ever done, says Ms. Mulcahy, who lives in Connecticut and is now actively involved with nonprofit organizations.<br />Mandatory retirement at 65 ended for most jobs in the mid-1980s, giving some people the impression they could work forever. Since life expectancy has increased—from 70 years old in 1959 to about 83 for today’s 65-year-olds—many people want to work longer, for both personal and financial reasons.<br />At their peak, boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, numbered almost 79 million, and their ranks include the first generation of career women and lots of people who remained single or got divorced. For many boomers, work has taken on an outsize role. It provides purpose, fulfillment and community. It creates structure and routine.</td>

Security forces detained more than 3,500 people—the largest number in at least nine years, according to independent monitors.<br />The protests have left the Kremlin facing a dilemma: Either bow to the pressure from the street and undermine its own authority by releasing Mr. Navalny or risk inciting more backlash and unifying the opposition by keeping him behind bars.<br />“There are few good options for Putin,” said Abbas Gallyamov, a Moscow-based political consultant and former speechwriter for Mr. Putin. “It seems like Navalny is attacking and the Kremlin is defending.”<br />Mr. Putin’s approval ratings have swooned in recent years amid a sluggish economy and protest activity. Observers say the Navalny demonstrations, if sustained, could pose a threat to Mr. Putin’s dominance despite constitutional changes approved last year that could allow him to stay in power until 2036.</td>

      <td>The National Baseball Hall of Fame suffered unprecedented losses over the past year, with seven members dying in 2020 and three more already passing in 2021. And with the results of the most recent election arriving this week, there’s a good chance that no new players will be inducted to replenish the ranks in Cooperstown.<br />The reason: The best candidates are failing the Hall’s character test, signaling a new era in how voters treat the most nebulous—and controversial—barrier to entry for baseball’s highest honor.<br />Eligible members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America receive Hall-of-Fame ballots every autumn instructing them to choose candidates not only based on their performance on the field, but also on their integrity, sportsmanship and character.

It was the second straight year they outspent all other companies, including stalwarts such as  AT&T Inc.  and  Boeing Co.<br />Facebook, facing federal and state antitrust lawsuits as well as a series of hearings summoning CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Washington, spent nearly $20 million in 2020, up nearly 18% from the previous year.<br />Amazon, which saw CEO Jeff Bezos testify before Congress for the first time and continued pressing to expand its business as a government contractor, spent about $18 million last year, up about 11% from 2019 spending.<br />“We’ve been clear that the internet needs updated regulations, which is why we’ll continue voicing our support for new rules that address today’s realities online,” a Facebook spokesman said.</td>

      <td>San Francisco company says its signature product, known as XRP, is a currency that shouldn’t be subject to securities laws</td>
      <td>Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive of Ripple, was last year publicly contemplating at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an initial public offering for the San Francisco startup.<br />The company had just raised about $200 million in a round of venture funding led by  Tetragon Financial Group ,  with a $10 billion valuation. The value of its signature product, a cryptocurrency called XRP, had fallen over the previous year. But Ripple was poised to rebuild the infrastructure for cross-border trades, Mr. Garlinghouse said, promising that its future was bright.<br />A year later, an IPO is off the table. Instead, Ripple’s future hinges on a judge’s ruling in a civil lawsuit filed in December by the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br />Regardless of the outcome, the case is expected to become a key precedent for how U.S. regulators craft rules and laws covering cryptocurrencies. It also highlights a broader truth about most digital currencies: Beyond the two largest, bitcoin and ether, most of the hundreds of others have struggled to find a utilitarian value beyond speculation.<br />At the heart of the SEC’s suit is a debate about XRP, a bitcoin-like digital asset created by Ripple’s founders that would grow to become the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency. It was designed to be part of a network that would help banks cut expenses in cross-border transfers. The related software, however, never gained traction, the SEC alleges, leaving XRP without a clear purpose, other than to funnel sales to Ripple.</td>

      <td>Several parallels between the dot-com bubble and today’s stock market are strong</td>
      <td>I have been resisting the comparison between the dot-com bubble and today’s stock market, but the similarities have grown too strong to ignore. Here are five areas where the parallels are strong, along with one caution about applying the bubble label to the broader market.<br />Anything connected to electric vehicles or clean energy has gone ballistic in the past few months. Electric-car maker  Tesla  is the most obvious example, becoming the fifth-largest U.S. company by value after rising eightfold last year. This year so far, it has added $134 billion to its market capitalization, far more than the $78 billion it was worth at the start of 2020.<br />Initial public offerings and the cash shells of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, now used as an alternative have been booming, attracting celebrity backers and allowing companies without any revenue, let alone profit, to join the market. The Renaissance IPO index, which tracks new listings, more than doubled last year, by far the best performance since it started in 2009. Perhaps most extreme was  QuantumScape ,  part-owned by Volkswagen, which hopes to commercialize its experimental solid-state batteries. It tripled in value to more than $25 billion during December, according to Refinitiv, before falling by more than half.<br />Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of smart and well-informed small investors. But stocks are again being swung about by the sort of amateur mistakes made by a beginner hoping to win big. One I wrote about recently is to buy a stock purely because its share price is low, which should be all but irrelevant but which drove performance in the first couple of weeks of this year.<br />Even more excruciating is to buy the wrong stock, as happened with last year’s rush into Zoom Technologies, owner of the ticker ZOOM and not a lot else, rather than the better-known  Zoom Video Communications  (ticker ZM). This month Elon Musk’s call to use Signal, an alternative to  Facebook ’s  WhatsApp messaging software, led to the unrelated biotech stock  Signal Advance  (ticker: SIGL) leaping from 60 cents a share to $38.70. It has plunged since but is still at $6.25, bafflingly.</td>

      <td>Growing up in Amarillo, Texas, Lizzy Chesnut Bentley was rarely without her cowboy boots—a pink pair from her grandfather when she was 4 years old.<br />At Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where Ms. Bentley was president of the student Oil and Gas Club, she developed a reputation for helping students from out of state find their first pair of Texas cowboy boots and wearing her own favorite pair—vintage men’s two-tone ostrich boots she bought for $30—at sorority formals. By the time she was 24, she had amassed a boot collection 50 pairs deep, many of them vintage finds.<br />The footwear is both “functional and a fashion statement,” Ms. Bentley says. “You can wear them all day. You can put on jeans, and a white T-shirt, and a red pair of cowboy boots, and you have your outfit right there.”<br />After graduating in 2012 she moved to Houston to work at  Halliburton  as a financial analyst. The oil business was booming and she loved the city, where everyone she met seemed to be professionally driven. One element of corporate culture irked her, though: She couldn’t find a pair of cowboy boots that worked with her buttoned-up office wardrobe. “I’m wearing heels every day. I’m looking around, all the men are wearing cowboy boots, and I was just jealous,” she says.<br />Finally, she designed her own—of black buffalo leather with a single strip of white piping up the side—that she tucked into skinny black pants and wore with a blouse and a blazer.</td>

Additionally, all athletes and athletic personnel were ordered to immediately quarantine until as late as Feb. 7.<br />The shutdown is an indication that the winter college season, including basketball, remains fragile during the pandemic–at a time when the National Collegiate Athletic Association is eager to stage its big-money March Madness tournaments after seeing them canceled last spring. The NCAA has already rejiggered the men’s and women’s tournaments, downsizing them from sprawling multi-state affairs to restrictive bubbles in Indianapolis, Ind., and San Antonio, respectively.<br />It is not known if college athletes on other campuses have contracted the more transmissible variant of the virus that was recently identified in the U.K. and has since spread to the U.S. and elsewhere. There is broad concern that the more contagious variant of the virus will cause new cases, hospitalizations and deaths to balloon, possibly overwhelming local health infrastructures in the process.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden is expected to fulfill a campaign pledge Monday by detailing his “Buy American” plan, an initiative that will be watched closely by other countries mindful of another of his promises—to mend fences with trading partners.<br />Domestic-purchase plans put other governments on alert, causing concern that their companies would be excluded from the U.S.’s huge government-procurement market when Washington is making massive investments to fight the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />“It’s particularly relevant to Canada and the U.S. because of our deeply integrated economies,” said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat who is now a vice president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. “Once the thing goes into effect, there will be Canadian companies who will say, ‘Oh, we are excluded.’ Then, they will begin to squawk.”<br />Although there are differences in the details, Mr. Biden’s initiative echoes former President Donald Trump’s own “Buy American” program, which was part of his “America First” policy that fueled tensions with trading partners through tariff wars and confrontations with the World Trade Organization.<br />The Buy American plan Mr. Biden espoused during the campaign called for tightening existing rules on government procurement by raising domestic content requirements and closing loopholes available for purchases of foreign products.</td>

      <td>A promising sign of a bounce back in the pandemic-ravaged economy has stalled: Fewer borrowers are resuming mortgage payments.<br />The proportion of homeowners postponing mortgage payments had been falling steadily from June to November, an indication that people were returning to work and the economy was beginning to recover. But the decrease has largely flattened since November, when the current wave of coronavirus cases surged in communities across the country.<br />For roughly the past two months, that group of homeowners has flatlined at about 5.5%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Though that is down from a peak of 8.55% in June, some economists are concerned about the stalling forbearance rate—and worry that it could even start climbing as the economy sheds jobs.<br />Other data indicate a slowing U.S. economy this winter, and greater pressure on household finances. Employers cut jobs last month for the first time since the spring. The number of job openings has declined, and claims for unemployment insurance remain elevated. Retail sales have fallen for three consecutive months.<br />“With the waning recovery, and more applications for unemployment claims, we’re likely going to see increased demand for forbearance,” said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Haus, a home-finance startup. “One of the safeguards people have, if they own a home, is to apply for forbearance.”</td>

But there are also a lot of personal-finance lessons we can learn—lessons that will put us in good stead, whatever the economic future holds.<br />Lessons about the importance of emergency funds and having different income streams. Lessons about how this time really isn’t different (no matter how much it feels different). Lessons about how personal finance is truly personal. And much more.<br />These are some of the lessons we heard about when we asked financial advisers and others to reflect on the past year. It was a year, no doubt, that many people would prefer to forget. But before we try to wipe those memories clean, here are some of the things that investors, savers and spenders would do well to remember.<br />One clear lesson from the past tumultuous year is that more Americans should work to build an emergency fund of at least one month of spending. An accessible emergency fund (kept in an easy-to-access form like a savings or checking account) can help alleviate the need for drastic cuts in spending when facing temporary shocks to your income.<br />While an emergency fund cannot make up for losing your job and facing long-term unemployment, it can help to reduce the impact of shorter-term economic disruptions. For instance, last year many households had members who were furloughed for several weeks while governments had mandated closures of their employers.</td>

That is an average of about 200,000 a day. It would need to administer 1.3 million a day to reach its August target.<br />India has more government vaccination-drive experience and manufacturing capacity than most countries, and it had cautioned that the campaign would start slowly. But in the first week, more than 40% fewer people showed up for shots than had been anticipated.<br />Government officials say they are still working out the bottlenecks,  but the low early turnout among health-care workers—the first to be offered the vaccine—suggests a much longer timeline than expected to protect the population through vaccinations.</td>

The new thinking is becoming mainstream among Democrats.<br />Trade policy should “involve a laser focus on what improves wages and creates high-paying jobs in the United States, rather than making the world safe for corporate investment,” Mr. Sullivan wrote early in the presidential campaign. “Why, for example, should it be a U.S. negotiating priority to open China’s financial system for  Goldman Sachs ?”<br />Clinton administration Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers goes even further, arguing against prioritizing gains for Hollywood, investment banks and inventors who want intellectual-property protection. Their “elite concerns” don’t contribute much to U.S. employment or tax revenue, he said in an interview.<br />Those views are reflected in Mr. Biden’s tax proposals, which are intended to prod U.S. companies to keep jobs at home rather than easing investment overseas. Expanding facilities in the U.S. would earn a tax credit; shifting production abroad, especially to tax havens, would be penalized by higher taxes.</td>

But lawmakers in both parties caution that Mr. Biden’s effort is likely to face some of the same headwinds the plans of the last three presidents did.<br />On his first day in office, Mr. Biden proposed a broad immigration bill that would create an eight-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants living in the country without a permanent legal status. It would have an expedited pathway for farmworkers and the young immigrants known as Dreamers, along with changes to the legal immigration, refugee and asylum systems. It proposes adding more technology to monitor people and drugs at the border—though no new barriers—along with $4 billion in aid to Central American countries to help stem the extreme poverty and gang violence that has prompted so many migrants to leave.<br />Unlike previous compromise bills, Mr. Biden’s proposal lacks the countermeasures of increased security or deterrence at the border that Republicans have asked for in exchange for legalization.<br />Some Democrats say they can rally around an immigration reform package that makes no concessions. But the approach is likely to quickly run into opposition from Senate Republicans, at least 10 of whom would need to support a measure for it to clear the Senate’s 60-vote hurdle for most legislation.<br />Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), the bill’s Senate sponsor, told a conference of the American Business Immigration Council on Thursday that enacting the bill would be a “herculean task,” and could prove impossible without Republican cooperation. But, he said, Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are strongly supportive of the effort.</td>

      <td>Scams targeting older adults take many forms, ranging from callers posing as grandchildren in need of financial assistance to emails directing people to fake bank websites where cons collect login credentials. The techniques evolve every year but the outcome is always the same: Many seniors end up losing money.<br />The isolation many older adults are experiencing during the pandemic has exacerbated the problem. Technology helps seniors stay connected with loved ones during a time of limited social interactions but it also opens new doors to scammers. Online puppy scams and romance scams are on the rise as bad actors seek to take advantage of people’s loneliness, according to the National Adult Protective Services Association.<br />Scammers initiated contact with older adults online more often than they did by phone for the first time ever in the second quarter of 2020, according to an October report from the Federal Trade Commission. Phone scams, though, still resulted in the highest monetary losses.<br />Older adults, defined by the FTC as those age 60 and over, were nearly six times as likely as younger ones to report losing money on tech-support scams. In all, older Americans reported fraud losses totaling $388 million through the third quarter of 2020, the latest data available from the FTC, up 23% from the same period a year earlier.<br />There are ways to safeguard assets and to prevent such scams from occurring in the first place. Here are some tips, based on interviews with several elder-care experts.</td>

      <td>Drugmaker say early supplies could lag projections by as much as 60% in a worst-case scenario</td>
      <td>AstraZeneca  PLC expects to deliver tens of millions fewer Covid-19 vaccine doses than planned to the European Union in coming months, according to people familiar with the matter, threatening the continent’s plans to ramp up vaccinations and delivering a fresh reputational blow to the drugmaker.<br />AstraZeneca disclosed the shortfall late Friday after briefing European officials earlier in the day. It blamed a manufacturing issue in Europe, but didn’t disclose the magnitude of the shortfall.<br />According to people familiar with the matter, the company told European officials that in a worst-case scenario AstraZeneca may be able to provide only around 30 million of roughly 80 million doses EU countries had anticipated for February and March, a roughly 60% decline from the company’s earlier estimates. AstraZeneca is working to significantly reduce that potential shortfall and says the roughly 30 million doses is the minimum it should be able to deliver, these people said.<br />The root cause of the problem is a manufacturing facility in Belgium owned by Novasep Holding SAS that has been unable to make as much bulk vaccine as projected, the people said. The facility’s so-called yield, or the amount of vaccine it can make from base ingredients, is running at about a third of AstraZeneca’s expectations, one of the people said. Novasep didn’t respond to requests for comment Saturday.<br />Vaccine yields can vary widely depending on “seeding” steps, taken over weeks, to grow cells needed to make the vaccine and later-stage processes to filter and purify the substance before it is packed into vials. AstraZeneca has found yields varying among its many manufacturing partners and has been working to boost production where it is lagging, the person said. The process is labor- and time-intensive. Reuters first reported the number of doses AstraZeneca may no longer be able to deliver.</td>

      <td>GROWING UP in Florida, Edouardo Jordan was raised on his grandmother’s cooking: neck bones and rice, stews, creamy yams, black-eyed peas, shrimp purloo. He knew that this repertoire was the bread and butter of her native Georgia, but he wasn’t aware how much of it originated in West Africa.<br />Two years and thousands of dollars spent on culinary school didn’t change that. Mr. Jordan went on to work for more than a decade in some of the country’s most celebrated kitchens—the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif., Per Se and Lincoln in New York City—before striking out on his own in 2015 with a contemporary American restaurant, Salare, in Seattle. At last he began digging into the roots of the Southern food he grew up on and the rich culinary traditions of Africa—a vision Mr. Jordan more fully realized when he opened JuneBaby, an ode to the food of his youth, in 2017.<br />Mr. Jordan is one of a growing number of Black chefs and food entrepreneurs today raising the profile of African and Afro-Caribbean flavors and dishes in a country that has long given them short shrift.<br />From the start, diners at Salare found a menu imbued with African influences, from Ethiopian spice mixes like berbere and mitmita to pikliz, the Haitian pickled slaw. Last August, in the wake of the pandemic, Mr. Jordan went all in, dedicating the whole restaurant to an exploration of how forced migration from Africa has influenced the foodways of places like Haiti and Brazil. (Since August Salare has been open for takeout only.) “I now had the opportunity to explore, express, really represent where I came from and what I knew as Black food,” Mr. Jordan said.<br />At Compère Lapin, in New Orleans, Nina Compton serves flavors of her native Saint Lucia in dishes like conch croquettes and cow heel soup, run through with French, Creole and Italian influences as well. Kwame Onwuachi rose to national acclaim after opening Kith/Kin in 2017 in Washington, D.C.; star dishes included West African jollof rice, Trinidadian goat roti and Ethiopian sambusas (savory pastries filled with spiced lamb). The restaurant closed last year, but Mr. Onwuachi vows that future ventures will center on the same themes. In 2018, television viewers received a crash course in West African foodways when, as a contestant on Bravo’s “Top Chef,” Eric Adjepong wowed judges with the likes of nutty, spicy egusi soup, the rice and bean dish waakye, and fufu, a doughy dumpling made from cassava and plantain flour—staple dishes in Ghana, where Mr. Adjepong’s parents were born and raised.</td>

      <td>On Jan. 25, 1921, Karel Čapek’s play “R.U.R.”—short for “Rossum’s Universal Robots”—premiered in Prague. It was a sensation. Within two years it had been translated into 30 languages, including English, to which it introduced the word “robot.” Čapek’s vision of unwilling slaves of humanity destined to rise up and destroy their makers has shaped our view of both automation and ourselves ever since.<br />In a century-long dialogue between inventors of fictional and actual robots, engineers have for the most part been forced to play catch-up, either realizing or subverting the vision of robots first expounded in books, movies and television.<br />Now, the reality of robots is in some areas running ahead of fiction, even ahead of what those who study robots for a living are able to keep track of.<br />Heather Knight is an engineer, “social roboticist” and one of 13 core faculty in Oregon State University’s robotics program. One day in late October, she was shocked to find the campus crawling with a fleet of autonomous, six-wheeled vehicles made by Starship Robotics. The San Francisco-based company had contracted with the campus dining service to provide contactless delivery.<br />“We’re at the point where not even the people in robotics know there are going to be robots on campus,” she adds.</td>

They’re also the last team to start the abbreviated 2021 season, this time because over two-thirds of the roster tested positive for Covid-19 upon returning for training camp.<br />Dallas rescheduled its first four games of the season, which began on Jan. 13 for the rest of the league, and played its first game on Friday night against the Nashville Predators, a 7-0 shutout victory.<br />It was a weird puck drop for the reigning Western Conference champions, made even more unusual by the circumstances of its start.

For Friday’s opener, 4,214 people were in attendance<br />“At this point with the manifest, we don’t have enough seats for the people that want to come,” said Stars president and chief executive officer Brad Alberts. “We’ve gotten an overwhelming response of people that want to come to our games.”<br />Health protocols in Texas cap attendance at 50% for professional sporting events, both indoor and outdoor. The Stars, however, are keeping crowds a hair under 5,000–about 27% of the American Airlines Center’s 18,532 seats.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Lawmakers approved stimulus checks last March as an intentionally scattershot move to flood households with cash when the course of the pandemic and economy were uncertain. Now, as Congress and President Biden pursue a third round of payments, the economic case for them is shifting.<br />A policy once viewed partly as a bridge until relief could be more carefully targeted became a recurring backstop to other programs during a bumpy recovery. Despite concerns from some Republicans and a few Democrats about giving money to people who don’t need it, many members of Congress now view the checks as an essential element of future relief legislation.<br />The checks’ broad appeal stems from their near-universality, simplicity and speed, and they may become a more routine government response to future recessions.<br />Though many payments would go to employed workers likely to save the money until after the pandemic, lawmakers defend that feature as necessary to fill gaps in social-spending programs. Unemployment insurance doesn’t cover everyone who lost a job or suffered an income decline, and some households faced long delays as states processed claims.<br />“The people that we want to help, some of them, many of them, millions of them, are not getting help,” said Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist who has studied stimulus payments and their impact.</td>

Snap Inc.  is expanding in promising new directions.<br />Social-media stocks have all soared over the past year as the Covid-19 pandemic has forced the world to communicate virtually, but Snap’s performance stands out. Its shares have more than doubled over the past four months, besting both  Twitter  and  Facebook  during the news-heavy election season and even outshining  Pinterest ,  which has blossomed into an e-commerce destination with nearly perfect timing.<br />Snap’s extraordinary run suggests that investors are valuing future potential over current performance. Wall Street expects Snap to have boosted revenue at roughly the same rate as Pinterest in 2020 and its monthly users at roughly half the rate. Snap is now trading at a sizable premium to Pinterest at 22 times forward sales—a level it hasn’t seen since its initial public offering back in 2017.<br />Snap has been working to enhance its appeal to businesses beyond traditional social-media advertising. That potential seems to be coming into focus now with analysts increasingly eyeing the company’s innovation pipeline, which MKM Partners’ Rohit Kulkarni calls the best in social media.<br />Snap said it has launched 15 different products and functionalities using augmented reality for businesses in just the first nine months of last year. A new marketing video released by Snap in December shows how Snapchatters can now virtually try on products such as shoes or nail polish. It also shows how users can physically scan a product’s logo to view information about it, including a tutorial on how to use it.</td>

In addition, though, agents of several mutual life insurance companies—those owned by their policyholders, not shareholders—must generate a minimum amount of sales to qualify for subsidized health insurance and other medical benefits.<br />People selling financial products can be expected to consider the link between sales and the cost of their benefits when they make recommendations, consumer advocates say.<br />“These types of arrangements at their core present conflicts that are bad for the consumer,” said David Certner, legislative counsel at AARP, the nonprofit advocacy group for people 50 years and older.<br />Some financial advisers at Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. have also complained. In internal online forums that allow agents and advisers to opine on the company’s benefits policies, at least six agents wrote that linking the cost of their health benefits to how much they sell of certain products creates a difficult conflict for them, according to copies of the posts reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</td>

Mr. Navalny, who was detained on Sunday upon his return to Russia from Germany following a near-fatal poisoning with a nerve agent, had called for protests and organizers said they expected rallies in more than 60 cities across Russia’s 11 time zones.<br />For Mr. Navalny, who has shown an ability to mobilize his large following into demonstrations, Saturday’s protests are a new test of his clout after being out of the country for five months, while supporters are facing freezing temperatures and increasing pressure from authorities. The strength and sustainability of the rallies would be an indication whether his movement can grow even as he is facing a potentially yearslong prison sentence, analysts say.<br />The rallies are the latest against President Vladimir Putin’s government following demonstrations in recent years against declining political freedoms and stagnating living standards. Observers say that the major concern for the Kremlin is whether the rallies could grow into a long-term display of resistance and attract more people ahead of this year’s parliamentary election.<br />“The protests are a vivid headache” for many in the ruling elite, said Konstantin Gaaze, a Moscow-based political analyst and former government adviser. “And for Navalny, it’s all in, he has nothing else but the menace of street protests.”</td>

      <td>The 58-year-old artist on her solo show at the Contemporary Austin and the magic pickle jar she keeps in her studio</td>
      <td>The artist: Though she’s been making art since she was a child, it wasn’t until she was in her mid-50s that Deborah Roberts became a market darling. In 2017, the Austin-based artist’s life changed after her mixed-media works were included in several prominent exhibitions, including the group show Fictions at the Studio Museum in Harlem. The Whitney and the Brooklyn Museum acquired her work, as did famous collectors like Beyoncé, Ava DuVernay and President Barack Obama.<br />Now 58, Roberts is known for collaged portraits of Black children, in which she combines found imagery with painting and drawing. Of the reason she’s drawn to her subjects, she explains, Black children “are seen as less innocent; they’re treated as adults when they do kid stuff. I thought I had a really good childhood and I want kids to be able to have that.” Growing up in Austin, Roberts had seven siblings; her mother worked as a maid and her father as an electrical lineman for the city. Though her focus has long been on girls and expanding the beauty standards that are imposed on them, Roberts now portrays Black boys too. “I didn’t know the numbers on how many young Black boys were put in special-ed classes or labeled as early as third grade as being very difficult, hard to teach,” she says. “I wanted to start highlighting some of the issues that young Black boys were facing.”<br />Roberts says her fast rise has been overwhelming at times. “I’m getting better control over it,” she says. “The first few years, I didn’t know what was happening. Now, I understand… I have to be a good steward.”<br />Her latest show: Roberts’s new show, I’m, which debuts at the Contemporary Austin January 23, is her first major solo museum exhibition in Texas. I’m features her paintings, signature collages and an interactive sound, text and video sculpture. The museum also commissioned Roberts to create an ongoing installation, a mural on one of its buildings. Titled Little man, little man, a tribute to James Baldwin’s children’s book of the same name, the mural depicts a young Black boy in six different poses of dance and celebration.<br />The show was originally scheduled for a September opening, but it was moved due to the coronavirus. Roberts used the extra time to continue working on collages she had started in 2019. Living through a pandemic, she noticed, affected her work. “When we went into lockdown, the idea that anybody could just say hello to you and give you this deadly illness—people became more important than normal,” she says. She noticed that when she got back to her studio practice, the portraits she was producing became larger. Keeping them smaller no longer felt right.</td>

Israel has approved the vaccine for anyone over 16. It won’t inoculate anyone under that age.<br />Ministry of Health data show that Israel’s younger population is far more likely to test positive for the coronavirus, with 10- to 19-year-olds making up 21% of known infections. The 20- to 29-year-old age group accounts for 19% of known infections.<br />“They are the megaspreaders,” Ido Hadari, director of government relations at Israel’s Maccabi Healthcare Services said of high-school students. “If we vaccinate these guys they will stop being spreaders.”<br />Israel is leading the world’s fastest vaccination campaign, so far administering the first dose of the  Pfizer Inc.  vaccine to almost 30% of its population since starting in late December. Israel has also received some shipments of the  Moderna Inc.  vaccine, but so far is mainly relying on Pfizer.</td>

      <td>Off Brand is a thrice-monthly column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />LEATHER SHOES are so widespread that most of us don’t give them a second thought. Animal skin has been the dominant footwear material since the early Mesopotamian civilization, despite some notable exceptions—ranging from silver and gold sandals in ancient Rome to mother-of-pearl shoes in 18th-century France. Leather is ideal for footwear: It’s comfortable, durable and readily available. Though the global population currently includes hundreds of millions of vegetarians, many still regularly lace up smooth leather Nike Air Jordans, pop on sheepskin Ugg boots and slip into pairs of smooth calfskin pumps.<br />But veganism, a stricter kind of vegetarianism that prohibits animal by-products and is usually linked to environmental concerns, is on the rise, and with it, a demand for stylish vegan shoes. “Vegan,” like “sustainable,” is a word annoyingly open to interpretation, but a vegan shoe is usually defined as one crafted neither from leather nor silk, cashmere, shearling or any other fauna-derived substances. Bonus points for shoes that use recycled materials or are biodegradable. Even shoes that appear vegan, such as fabric flats, can be lined in thin leather, or bound with animal-collagen glue.<br />Vegan shoes can be made of synthetic blends or a host of other experimental, plant-based materials such as corn derivatives, wood, mushrooms, hemp, cotton, cork, pineapple and bacteria. Yes, the kind of bacteria that gave us kombucha can be transformed into vegan shoe “leather.”<br />While these strictures might sound extreme to your average Joe, they’re being increasingly adopted. Consumer analyst Carmen Bryan of GlobalData said that the percentage of Americans “aligning with vegan diets...shot up” from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020. She explained, “This has been driven by increased awareness of individual carbon footprints, environmental concerns and the impact healthy eating has on one’s mental health. The pandemic, especially in the early months, forced many U.S. citizens to slow down and reassess their priorities, leading to radical lifestyle changes.”</td>

      <td>At the Clark Art Institute, six new outdoor works engage with the museum’s 140-acre campus.</td>
      <td>Williamstown, Mass.<br />As the pandemic compels us to take our culture al fresco, outdoor sculpture is having its day in the sun. The next day, however, might be partly cloudy. And the next might bring a frost with the chance of freezing rain. In other words the outdoors, unlike the white cube of a gallery, can challenge sculpture itself as much as the scenery compels us as viewers.<br />When the Clark Art Institute looked to bring art into the wilds of its own backyard in Williamstown, Mass., the muddy, icy, windswept challenges of a New England hillside called Stone Hill suggested an opportunity to do something different with sculpture than just display art plopped in a plaza, as we often encounter such outdoor work. An exhibition called “Ground/Work,” organized by guest curators Molly Epstein and Abigail Ross Goodman and on view through Oct. 17, now presents six commissioned pieces by six contemporary artists (all created last year) scattered around a 140-acre woodland pasture. This landscape with trails that rise several hundred feet and connect with a larger conservation area means visitors should be prepared for more than a walk in the sculpture park.<br />As an institution best known for its collection of 19th-century European and American art, the Clark is wise to use this outdoor space to bring contemporary voices and its natural assets into the mix. Through a language of reserved modernist form, each of these new works is designed to engage with the weather and the vistas, the birds and cows, all in “active dialogue,” according to exhibition literature, with this specific environment. It’s just too bad we need a field guide to some of the works in order to understand the overwrought concepts behind their creation.<br />You could easily miss the first work on view, which is embedded in the museum architecture itself. Jennie C. Jones has attached a 16-foot sculpture of powder-coated aluminum, wood and harp strings to the end of a free-standing wall. Called “These (Mournful) Shores,” the work is an Aeolian harp, meant to be strummed by the wind, that, according to the label, refers to the Middle Passage. It’s an elegiac idea but with layers of conceptual meaning that muddy the effect. Its dark gray palette, meant to recall that of two seascapes by Winslow Homer in the Clark collection, further mutes what should be a more resonant work.</td>

      <td>People world-wide are dying at the fastest pace in years because of the coronavirus. In response, deaths are now getting counted faster than ever, potentially giving public-health experts and policy makers a clearer picture to make decisions.<br />Weeks after the virus hit Italy last year, doctors, funeral homes and officials realized that government Covid-19 death tolls were too low and many victims weren’t getting included. Informal tallies quickly revealed that thousands of deaths most likely caused by the virus had been omitted. Limited testing left the number of infections unknown, and many people had died outside hospitals, which were the initial source of fatality figures.<br />Italy’s statistical agency, Istat, scrambled to assemble more reliable information, collecting data from towns and cities faster than ever before. In May, it revealed what people at the front lines had suspected: a 39% jump in nationwide deaths between Feb. 21 and March 31 compared with previous years.<br />“Normally, they [the data] would have arrived six months later,” said Istat President Gian Carlo Blangiardo in May. “We made an extraordinary effort.”<br />Authorities across Europe and the U.S. soon followed Italy’s race for information on deaths. Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, in April for the first time collected and published weekly death data for 31 countries, it said, “to support the policy and research efforts related to Covid-19.” The same month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the first time began publishing weekly national death data.</td>

On Jan. 6, he joined the mob that broke into the U.S. Capitol and posted a photo of himself next to a fellow off-duty officer with his middle finger raised in front of a statue of a Revolutionary War commander, according to court documents.<br />Mr. Fracker and the other officer, Thomas Robertson, were arrested last week on charges of knowingly entering a restricted building and violent entry or disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. A public defender representing Mr. Fracker declined to comment. On Facebook, the Marine Corps veteran said he did nothing illegal. “I can protest for what I believe in and still support your protest for what you believe in. I fought for your right to do it,” he wrote in a Facebook post after the riot, according to the complaint.<br />Mr. Robertson couldn’t be reached for comment. He posted the photo on Instagram and said he was proud of it, according to a federal complaint.<br />A spokesman for the Virginia National Guard, which deployed to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 7, said it would investigate the matter. Rocky Mount’s town manager said Messrs. Fracker and Robertson have been put on administrative leave while officials review the case.<br />As total federal arrests in the Capitol riot grow past 100, Mr. Fracker is one of at least 18 current and former police officers, firefighters and military members who have been charged as of Friday, according to a Wall Street Journal tally. They include a retired Pennsylvania firefighter accused of throwing a fire extinguisher at Capitol police and a Navy veteran who calls himself the QAnon Shaman. In addition, Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt was shot and killed by Capitol Police as she tried to climb through a window on a door inside the building.</td>

The streaming giant’s continued growth comes in the midst of heightened competition from tech giants and media conglomerates. A new rival,  ViacomCBS Inc.’s  Paramount+, is slated to launch in March and will exploit a key advantage media companies have over their tech competitors: cross-promotion. Netflix shares surged 17% Wednesday.<br />Microsoft Corp.<br />Microsoft is betting big on driverless cars. The software giant on Tuesday joined a group of companies that will invest more than $2 billion in General Motors Co.’s driverless-car startup, Cruise. Under the terms of the deal, Cruise will use Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing platform to help it roll out autonomous-vehicle services. GM said Microsoft would be its preferred cloud provider and help it streamline supply chains and roll out new digital services to customers. In recent years, the tech giant has been aggressively pushing its cloud-computing business, where it rents server capacity and software tools to customers. Microsoft shares rose 1.8% Tuesday.<br />UnitedHealth Group Inc.</td>

New chip-making incentives were included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed in January, although the measures have yet to receive funding.<br />Samsung’s proposed plant would employ up to 1,900 people and aims to be operational by October of 2022, according to correspondence viewed by The Wall Street Journal between Samsung and the city manager of Goodyear, Ariz., one of the places the company is considering. As is customary with large industrial projects, the local Goodyear authorities are offering a range of incentives, including tax breaks and infrastructure upgrades to lure the factory, according to the letter.</td>

      <td>Those wrists. Other hitters always talked about the strength in those wrists and forearms as they whipped a bat through the strike zone. What a sight as they knocked another pitch for a line-drive base hit or an arcing shot into the bleachers. Few—maybe no one else—could swing a baseball bat like Henry “Hank” Aaron, who died this week at age 86.<br />Aaron is best known for breaking Babe Ruth’s major-league home run record on April 8, 1974. But readers of a certain age remember him as one of the greatest overall hitters of all time. Year after year he was among the leaders in batting average, runs batted in and home runs.<br />He did it in the era when the pitcher’s mound was higher and pitching was dominant. He also did it before the era of steroid use that pumped up the stats of many players who wouldn’t have hit 20 dingers a year in the days of Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson. That isn’t nostalgia talking. It’s physics and biology.<br />Aaron’s record of 755 career home runs was surpassed more than three decades later by Barry Bonds, and “Hammerin’ Hank” was gracious to Mr. Bonds when it happened. But aficionados of the sport recognize that the real record still belongs to the sweet swinger who played for more than two decades for the Milwaukee and then Atlanta Braves.<br />Aaron’s march to break the Babe’s record was marred by threats and racist hate mail, and he often said it motivated him all the more. Aaron had grown up in Mobile, Ala., in the Jim Crow era of the 1930s and 1940s, and he revered Jackie Robinson for breaking the color barrier in the big leagues. With his baseball success, Aaron became a hero to a generation of youngsters of all races in the decades when baseball still was America’s pastime.</td>

      <td>Climate activists are now running federal oil and gas permitting.</td>
      <td>Any doubt that the Biden Administration plans to slowly regulate fossil fuels out of existence vanished this week. First came the Keystone XL pipeline kill, but perhaps more significant is the 60-day freeze on new leases on federal lands and bureaucratic permitting. The pause could soon become a long-term ban.<br />Federal lands account for about 22% of U.S. oil production, 12% of natural gas and 40% of coal. When the Obama Administration slowed oil and gas permitting on federal land, drilling and exploration shifted to private land. The Biden Administration may shut that down too.<br />Start with the 60-day suspension on new leases on federal land. Producers in older oil and gas fields won’t be significantly affected, and many have already scaled back investment in places like California and Louisiana while pouring more into shale. But shale fracking occurs in large part on federal land in western states, and it continually requires new leases and investment.<br />Federal land accounts for 51.9% of New Mexico’s oil production and 66.8% of its natural gas, as well as a sizable share of gas extraction in Colorado (41.6%), Utah (63.2%) and Wyoming (92.1%). A federal leasing ban would cost some 18,000 jobs in Colorado, 33,000 in Wyoming and 62,000 in New Mexico by 2022, according to the American Petroleum Institute.<br />States would also lose hundreds of millions of dollars of mineral royalties that are shared by the feds. Oil and gas revenue accounts for 20% of New Mexico’s budget. Downstream suppliers like fracking sand mines in Wisconsin and steel manufacturers in Pennsylvania would also be hit.</td>

      <td>Viewers of Andrew Cuomo’s Emmy-award winning Covid-19 briefings may have noticed how the New York Governor has become increasingly excitable. In this week’s budget show, he pointed an economic gun at New York and threatened to shoot if Washington doesn’t fork over $15 billion.<br />“If the federal government doesn’t fund state and local governments, it’s going to hurt all New Yorkers,” Mr. Cuomo warned Tuesday while proposing to raise the state’s top income tax rate in New York City to 14.7%. This would be the highest rate in the country, at least until New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy makes a competing bid.<br />Mr. Cuomo’s ultimatum goes like this: Democrats in Washington must deliver $15 billion in budget relief pronto or he will raise the state’s top tax rate to 10.82% from 8.82% on income over $100 million and create four new tax brackets on income of more than $5 million. New York City has a top rate of 3.88%, though Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to raise it too.<br />The Governor says the higher rates would be temporary, but New Yorkers know better than to believe him after he broke his promise to let the millionaire’s tax that Albany imposed during the 2009 recession expire. Mr. Cuomo is also begging Democrats in Congress to lift the $10,000 state-and-local tax (SALT) deduction limit to mitigate his tax hike.<br />Even if they do, they might not restore it for New York’s wealthy. And what Democrats giveth in SALT, they will taketh by raising rates. Mr. Biden has proposed increasing the top income tax rate to 39.6% from 37% (and applying it to capital gains), extending the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax to income above $400,000 and restoring the Pease deduction limitation.</td>

      <td>Impeachment for former officials was the norm at the time of the founding.</td>
      <td>One of the first questions the Senate will face in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial is whether the chamber has jurisdiction to hear a case against a former official. The correct answer is yes.<br />For the Founders, it would have been obvious that the “power to impeach” included the ability to hold former officials to account. The impeachment power was imported to America from England, where Parliament impeached only two men during the 18th century, both former officers. No U.S. state constitution limited impeachments to sitting officers, and some allowed impeachment only of former officers. In 1781 the Virginia General Assembly subjected Thomas Jefferson to an impeachment inquiry after he completed his term as governor.<br />Why would former officers be included within the impeachment power? Impeachment trials had long served as a vehicle for exposing and formally condemning official wrongdoing, or for a former officeholder to clear his name. Disqualification from future office was also an important penalty. A former Vermont lawmaker was impeached and disqualified from future state office for leading one of the tax rebellions that spurred the drafting of the U.S. Constitution. The American founders understood the history of demagogues and dictators corrupting republics and the need to exclude them from future office. As one delegate to a state ratifying convention put it, men who held public office should be “within the reach of responsibility” so that “they cannot forget that their political existence depends upon their good behavior.”<br />There’s no hint in the debate over the Constitution of an exception to the impeachment power as traditionally understood. George Mason insisted at the convention that the text should be encompassing enough at least to cover a case like that of Warren Hastings, the former colonial governor then standing trial in the British House of Lords. Everyone agreed. During ratification James Madison and Alexander Hamilton emphasized that the proposed federal impeachment power was an improvement in constitutional design because, unlike in some states, even current officers could be subjected to impeachment.<br />The Senate shouldn’t depart from centuries of practice and understanding. Declining to try Mr. Trump would set a dangerous new precedent, denying future presidents and other officials the opportunity to clear their names if they leave office, and allowing them to escape accountability by resigning—or saving their worst acts for the end of their term.</td>

      <td>He could have broken the norm that says don’t deliver unwelcome news or treat voters like grown-ups.</td>
      <td>My first surprise was that Donald Trump embraced the job after his 2016 win, not treating his election as an unwelcome accident, a publicity stunt gone awry, or a personal disaster facilitated by the mad interventions of James Comey.<br />He had every reason to. For the first time in his life, he would face opponents who didn’t merely want to get the better of him in a business deal but who craved his destruction. Welcome to politics. And he compounded his risk by his lifelong  habit of bringing only episodic focus to any issue. Example: He pretty much lost interest in Covid when he saw his press conferences were not a ratings success.<br />Only lately has anyone remembered that Woodrow Wilson presided over the 1918 flu. Mr. Trump’s performance will be faulted for many reasons but the inquiry you won’t see is one that penetrates to a deeper truth, in which Mr. Trump proved a sideshow.<br />Because of the political stakes, our every perception of Covid tends to be politicized. In the first days of the pandemic, the press coverage was alive with inquiry and discovery but soon was overtaken by talking points. This is why. And while much excellent reporting is still done, the recent summaries of our failures being ordered up by editors all read like exercises in learning nothing. They are compendiums of wouldas and shouldas that long since went poof for any thinking person.<br />Top of the list is magic solution X, a national test and trace program. I won’t mince words. A 9-year-old could see the math didn’t work. Covid spreads more easily than the flu. An overwhelming share of cases are asymptomatic or indistinguishable from ailments that millions of Americans suffer every day. In a country as big, mobile and open as the U.S., this meant there was zero chance of catching and isolating enough spreaders to matter.</td>

      <td>Republicans may feel good about their chances, but recalls often redound to the benefit of the recalled.</td>
      <td>A push to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom is gaining steam, and Republicans in the Golden State are feeling good about it. Public frustration with the state’s pandemic response, combined with outrage at Mr. Newsom’s inexplicable decision to attend a maskless dinner at the Michelin-starred French Laundry restaurant in November, has propelled a popular uprising against the first-term Democrat. The petitioners claim they have more than 1.1 million of the roughly 1.5 million valid signatures they must submit by March 17.<br />California’s chief executive is subject to one of the least onerous voter recall processes in the country. This is the sixth recall campaign in two years to target Mr. Newsom. A petition sponsor need only gather the signatures of 12% of the voter turnout in the previous statewide election—in this case 1,495,709 names. California also grants 160 days to gather those signatures (extended here because of the pandemic). Other states that allow recalls typically require twice as many signatures collected, proportionate to the population, in half as much time. A recall effort against Colorado Gov. Jared Polis only had 60 days to find 631,226 signatures in a state with one-sixth the population of California.<br />California also has a well-developed signature-gathering industry thanks to the popularity of ballot initiatives in the state. A recall can easily get on the ballot.<br />Despite Democratic dominance of California politics, Republicans haven’t gone extinct in the state. In 2020 Donald Trump won more than six million votes in California, his largest total in any state. But while the Newsom recall effort is grabbing headlines and reminding some of the successful 2003 recall of Gov. Gray Davis, another Democrat, a recall can cut both ways. It may be a humbling event or a political boon. Plenty of targeted officials have actually benefited from a recall race.<br />Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker became a Republican hero after fending off his 2012 recall. Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald defeated a recall attempt in 2012, as did California state Sen. Jeff Denham in 2008. Both went on to win seats in Congress. In 2019 California state Sen. Josh Newman was ousted in a recall vote but took the seat back in November. Dennis Kucinich barely survived a recall vote as Cleveland mayor in 1978 before going on to win a House seat and garnering 40 delegates in the 2004 Democratic presidential contest.</td>

Cohen, Melvin bets on and against stocks and managed about $12.5 billion at the start of the year. Its short book, or array of bets against companies, has driven losses so far this year, said people familiar with the matter. Melvin’s losses were broad-based and not driven by losses on GameStop or any other specific stock, some of them said.<br />The stumble by one of the best-performing hedge funds in recent years underscores the heavy losses being suffered by short sellers at a time when major indexes have soared to records. The market is as exuberant as many traders and portfolio managers say they have seen since the tech bust 20 years ago.<br />Many investors have complained about short squeezes that have left them nursing losses. In a short squeeze, heavy buying forces short bettors to buy back shares to limit their losses.<br />A sign of the pain short sellers are experiencing:  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s  basket of the 50 stocks with the highest short interest as a share of market capitalization was up a total 25% for the year through Friday, compared with a total-return of 2.4% by the S&P 500.</td>

      <td>United Airlines Holdings Inc.  wants to require its workers to get Covid-19 vaccines, Chief Executive Scott Kirby told employees on Thursday, though he cautioned there are logistical hurdles to implementing such a mandate.<br />The head of one of the largest U.S. airlines said United would be among the first wave of companies to require vaccines, if other companies follow.<br />“Because I have confidence in the safety of the vaccine—and I recognize it’s controversial—I think the right thing to do is for United Airlines, and for other companies, to require the vaccines and to make them mandatory,” he said. His comments were reported earlier by CNBC.<br />Mr. Kirby is one of the first corporate leaders to take such a position and called on other companies to follow.<br />“I don’t think United will get away with and can realistically be the only company that requires vaccines and makes them mandatory,” he said.</td>

It marks a record for SPAC deals, which have become all the rage on Wall Street, according to data provider SPACInsider.<br />The Michigan-based mortgage company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol UWMC, closed at $11.35 on Friday, slightly below Gores Holdings’ closing price of $11.54 on Thursday.<br />SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, put a reverse spin on the conventional model for public offerings because they raise money before developing a business. They use the funds to make an acquisition that turns the target into a public company. Once the blank-check company merges with a target company, as Gores Holdings and UWM did Thursday, that company gets the SPAC’s spot on a stock exchange, enabling it to sell shares to the public.<br />UWM works with independent brokers around the country to underwrite and service mortgages. It is one of a number of nonbank mortgage companies embracing the public markets at a booming time for the U.S. housing market. Low interest rates helped push mortgage originations to record levels in 2020. UWM was the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. in the first three quarters of 2020, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance.</td>

Yet some of Mr. Biden’s early moves could create conflict with business groups and their congressional allies.<br />Mr. Biden has called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and has picked Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former union leader with close ties to organized labor, for Labor Department secretary.<br />The president on Friday signed executive orders including provisions that would restore collective bargaining power for federal workers, among other labor-focused measures. On the campaign trail, he said he would create a cabinet-level group to focus on promoting union organizing and collective bargaining.<br />Mr. Biden backs passage of legislation sought by labor groups to increase union membership and boost employee protections. The bill would weaken state-level right-to-work laws, which prohibit unions from compelling membership as a condition of employment, and block firms from replacing striking workers, among other measures.

Greg Abbott and Ken Cuccinelli, then acting deputy secretary of homeland security, says it establishes a binding and enforceable commitment between DHS and Texas, in which DHS would “consult with Texas before taking any action or making any decision that could reduce immigration enforcement, increase the number of removable or inadmissible aliens in the United States, or increase immigration benefits or eligibility for benefits for removable or inadmissible aliens.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—In a new document made public Friday, the nation’s top military intelligence agency acknowledged monitoring the location of U.S.-based mobile devices without a warrant through location data drawn from ordinary smartphone apps.<br />The Defense Intelligence Agency told congressional investigators that the agency has access to “commercially available geolocation metadata aggregated from smartphones” from both the U.S. and abroad. It said it had queried its database to look at the location information of U.S.-based smartphones five times in the last 2½ years as part of authorized investigations.<br />Such data is typically drawn from smartphone apps such as weather, games and other apps that get user permission to access a phone’s GPS location. A robust commercial market exists for such data for advertising and other commercial purposes. The Wall Street Journal first revealed last year that numerous U.S. government agencies were also buying access to that data from commercial brokers without a warrant, raising questions about whether those agencies were adequately safeguarding the privacy and civil liberties of Americans.<br />The ability of U.S. intelligence agencies to access data on Americans for intelligence purposes is typically circumscribed. A warrant from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is required for most kinds of surveillance. However, the Defense Intelligence Agency told Congress that it didn’t believe it needed any sort of court authorization to acquire commercial data for foreign intelligence or national security purposes.<br />That echoes a position taken by numerous other U.S. government agencies in recent years as the amount of data on individuals using computers, smartphones and tablets has exploded. The Department of Homeland Security is buying a similar data product and is using it for warrantless tracking as part of its border security and immigration mission. The Internal Revenue Service also purchased access to cellphone data as part of its law enforcement mission. All claim because the data is purchased on the open market, no court order is required.</td>

The National Security Council has also been directed to develop ways to identify threats, share information and disrupt networks, she said, adding that free-speech rights would be respected.<br />In announcing the initiative, Ms. Psaki mentioned the Capitol riot and not other specific instances after nearly a year of unrest in cities across America. Republicans have been critical of Mr. Biden for what they contend was a belated condemnation of unrest over the summer involving left-wing activists in Portland, Ore., and Seattle who targeted federal buildings—violence that was reprised in those cities on Inauguration Day.<br />In a subsequent exchange with The Wall Street Journal, Ms. Psaki said the president opposes such violence in all forms.</td>

      <td>U.S. home sales in 2020 surged to their highest level in 14 years, fueled by ultralow interest rates and a pandemic that sent buyers scrambling for more spacious homes to accommodate remote work.<br />Robust home sales in the second half of the year surprised many economists while offering a rare bright spot for an economy run aground by closed businesses and mounting job losses during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Pandemic-driven job losses were concentrated in lower-paying industries, while households with higher pay and the resources to buy a new home weathered the downturn better. The pandemic prompted many of them to leave big cities for suburbs or smaller towns, while record-low borrowing rates made the decision to trade up easier. Once shelter-in-place restrictions eased, sales took off in June and have rarely flagged since then.<br />“It’s totally because of the pandemic,” said Brittany McCreary, who with her husband last month bought their first home, a four-bedroom stone farmhouse, in York, Pa., after leaving the Chicago area. “We’re glad we’re not renting anymore. We always wanted to buy.”<br />Existing-home sales rose 0.7% in December from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. The December sales marked a 22% increase from a year earlier.</td>

Oil has stayed in a tight trading range recently as investors weigh worries about crumbling consumption against large supply reductions.<br />Prices have increased steadily since the beginning of the year, with the U.S. benchmark passing $50 a barrel last month for the first time since early last year. That was when a production fight between major producers flooded global markets just as the pandemic’s first round of shutdowns sent consumption plunging. An oil glut threatened to overwhelm storage, sending prices below $0 for the first time.<br />Signs that major producers intend to continue output cuts, as well as a faster-than-expected economic recovery in China, have since powered a rebound. Many traders now say further gains require an acceleration in demand from increased travel and a broader reopening.<br />Denting those hopes in recent sessions: the slow rollout of vaccines and warnings of ongoing pandemic restrictions. The Biden administration in recent sessions reimposed mask restrictions, warned of a mounting death toll and said it could take months to turn things around.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—In his first three days in office, President Biden has taken more than two dozen executive actions designed to reverse Trump administration policies and enact longstanding liberal priorities on protecting the environment, enhancing workers’ protections and increasing the role of government in the economy.<br />The moves have prompted opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who say that they undermine Mr. Biden’s push for bipartisan deal making and national unity, a major theme of his inaugural address. At the same time, while his early policy efforts have been broadly cheered by Democrats, some progressives are urging him to go further, reflecting Mr. Biden’s challenge of balancing pressures from both parties.<br />Since taking office Wednesday, Mr. Biden’s actions have reversed some of former President Donald Trump’s highest-profile policy initiatives by overturning a travel ban on several majority-Muslim and other countries and revoking a permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. They also lay the groundwork for what Mr. Biden says will be his administration’s focus: boosting economic growth, dealing with the pandemic, and increasing government spending on programs designed to assist Americans hard hit by the pandemic-induced recession.<br />“There is plenty of time for President Biden to remember that he does not owe his election to the far left,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) in a speech Thursday. He accused Mr. Biden of contradicting his rhetoric on bipartisanship by catering to a progressive agenda with moves such as revoking the Keystone XL permit and rejoining the Paris climate accord.<br />“The American people stunned the so-called experts with the number of Republicans they sent to the House and the Senate to make sure common-sense conservative values have a powerful say in this government,” Mr. McConnell said. “So our side is ready to share ideas and work with the Biden administration, applying common sense to find common ground for the common good.”</td>

EU nations have placed big orders for the AstraZeneca shot, partly because it doesn’t require the cold storage needed for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Officials have been banking on the arrival of their AstraZeneca orders next month to speed up bloc-wide vaccinations.<br />The AstraZeneca disclosure also threatens a fresh reputational hit to the British pharmaceutical giant, which partnered with the University of Oxford in developing the vaccine. AstraZeneca is responsible for manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine, as well as regulatory approvals.<br />The company has previously faced criticism over how it initially communicated results of the vaccine’s late-stage human trials.</td>

      <td>Ornately-carved pillars and friezes from a 16th-century South Indian temple bring the stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata to life.</td>
      <td>Stepping into the South Asian galleries of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (which reopened on Jan. 8 after being closed due to Covid-19), we walk between two large figures that artists in South India carved around 1560. They don’t immediately register as pillars, so prominently do the sculptures protrude. One portrays a handsome young man sitting under a tree looking rather pleased with himself. He is Rama, god and hero of the Ramayana epic, flanked by his wife, Sita, and the ever-loyal monkey king, Hanuman, carved in relief on either side of the monolithic pillar. Opposite him stands a bearded man with the haunches of a beast, leaning forward, club raised to do battle. Yet this “man-beast,” or Purushamirukam, feels more theatrical than menacing with his mound of neatly coiffed hair, delicately arched eyebrows, and loads of jewelry. He isn’t about to attack; he’s enacting a story.<br />This feeling of performance intensifies as we take in the pillared temple hall—or mandapa—that fills the rest of the gallery. Rows of slender columns demarcate three sides of a rectangle within which 10 more life-size figures, bejeweled from headdress to anklet, face one another across a broad space. Above them, lions look down from the capitals and a partial frieze of reliefs illustrates scenes from the Ramayana while, on the slender columns and the sides and backs of the figural pillars, a plethora of mostly smaller reliefs beckon. They include baby Krishna dancing with delight, a ball of butter cupped in each hand; an architect-priest with his measuring stick; musicians, dancers, animals; and, twice, a pregnant woman sitting, head resting in her hand. She is likely Sita in a fraught scene from an addendum to the Ramayana. (Photographs and a video on the museum’s website can’t capture the carvings’ impact but provide useful aids.)<br />To 16th-century South Indians, these reliefs and monumental figures conjured verses penned by revered saints and episodes from epics and local folk tales. To gather in a mandapa, then, was to take part in a festival, attend a performance or join a social gathering, all in the company of divine, literary and royal personages. But while the configuration in the museum follows basic conventions for mandapas, it does not replicate a structure that once existed. It can’t. Its 60-plus blocks of carved granite were lying in a pile of rubble when Adeline Pepper Gibson, Philadelphia heiress and lover of art, purchased them from a trustee of the Madana Gopala Swamy Temple in Madurai in 1912.<br />There is no record of when the mandapa was dismantled (most likely to make way for new construction), nor any information about its original configuration. Darielle Mason, the museum’s curator for South Asian and Himalayan art, knows there was “a logic to each element” and thought-out relationships among figures, but holds little hope of ever re-creating what an architect-priest was thinking centuries ago. Her research has, however, convinced her that almost everything Pepper purchased was part of a single mandapa; that it was probably open on at least three sides, as suggested by the gallery’s sky blue walls; and that Rama and Purushamirukam belong with the others who stand in the center, inviting us to come close.<br />Nothing—no strip along the floor, no pane of glass—gets in the way of our admiring the skill it took to carve into hard granite the delicate ridges of a robe, the smooth swell of a belly, the curl of a lip or each graduated bead of a necklace. There is a sense of incipient movement, whether it is a slightly bent knee or the start of a bow. We recognize Hanuman by the long, sinuous tail; a demigod by a small, sharp fang; and the bird-god Garuda by the broken-off quills and feathers of wings. Two of the figures hold gourds, marking them as sages, and four appear to be saints. Then there is the muscular, mustachioed warrior standing atop diminutive pachyderms who, like Purushamirukam, holds a mace poised midair. He is Bhima of the Mahabharata epic, a man with the strength of 10,000 elephants, emerging from stone into our world like a superhero.</td>

      <td>Oil-and-gas companies seek new routes to market for Canada’s top export</td>
      <td>TORONTO—President Biden’s revocation of a permit for  TC Energy Corp.’s  Keystone XL pipeline is raising pressure on Canada’s energy industry to seek new markets for oil and gas, its top export.<br />Mr. Biden revoked the Keystone XL permit on Wednesday, hours after taking office, effectively shutting down a 12-year, cross-border project that would have carried 830,000 barrels a day from Alberta to Nebraska and eventually to refiners on the Gulf Coast. His executive order, which fulfilled a campaign promise, cited concerns about climate change.<br />Canada, the world’s fourth-largest oil producer, is left with fewer options to get its dense, sticky crude from landlocked oil sands to U.S. refiners. Canada and industry executives are also working to counter claims that tapping oil sands is more damaging to the climate than some other types of oil. They say Canadian producers have lowered carbon emissions by using less coal-fired power and more renewable energy to run their operations, among other steps.<br />Chris Bloomer, president of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, a trade group, said Mr. Biden’s decision didn’t take into account the work the Canadian industry has done to reduce emissions. “Obviously, it’s very disappointing,” he said.<br />Jason Kenney, leader of the province of Alberta, where most of Canada’s oil is produced, wrote a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau requesting that Canada press the U.S. for compensation. Scott Moe, premier of Saskatchewan, said Mr. Trudeau shouldn’t accept the rescinding of the permit. “I’d ask him to be firmer in his tone,” Mr. Moe said in an interview.</td>

      <td>Until you can jet off to The Netherlands worry-free, we’ve devised ways to immerse yourself in its capital from afar</td>
      <td>In the new “Wish You Were There” series, we offer a virtual visit to a beloved destination by asking locals and insiders to recommend transportive films, books, music and podcasts, as well as a few quintessential drinks and dishes. Bon voyage!<br />IF YOU’RE the kind of traveler who values small pleasures over spectacular monuments, the Dutch capital of Amsterdam is a place you visit more than once. You get drawn back again and again, to bike along glittering canals, sip tiny beers in charming old “brown cafes,” and just otherwise bask in pleasant vibes. Find a quiet spot away from the crowds, and it can feel like a home away from home.<br />That’s easiest in winter. You’ll miss out on the festive summertime street scene, but with long nights and cold rains chasing the casual tourists away, it’s a snap to find a cozy corner spot at the cafe. And with vaccines slowly rolling out around the world, it might not be too early to plan a trip for next winter.<br />As we dare to fantasize about travel again, here’s some fuel: a virtual tour of Amsterdam via music, food, books, movies and a good stiff drink. We’ve compiled lists of recommendations, and even enlisted a handful of distinguished locals and experts to suggest artifacts and recipes that will bring the city and its history into your home, from Dutch comfort food to a classic read from the city’s most famous former resident.<br />U.S.-born Russell Shorto, author of the celebrated tome “Amsterdam: A History of the World’s Most Liberal City,” earned a Dutch knighthood for strengthening Netherlands-U.S. relations with his writing.

      <td>Beijing plans to pivot from trade issues to climate change and the pandemic in an effort to overcome divisions</td>
      <td>Looking to reset the troubled U.S.-China relationship, Beijing is pressing for a meeting of its top diplomat with senior aides to President Biden to explore a summit between the two nations’ leaders, according to people with knowledge of the initiative.<br />Beijing raised the idea starting in December of dispatching Yang Jiechi, a member of the Politburo, the Communist Party’s top decision-making body, to Washington. The proposal, made soon after President Xi Jinping congratulated Mr. Biden on his election victory, was through letters by the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, and through conversations with intermediaries.<br />Beijing is planning a different message for Mr. Yang to bring to Washington than it had delivered during the Trump administration, when trade issues were Washington’s priority. Now, with Mr. Biden emphasizing climate change and the pandemic, Mr. Yang plans to also focus on those issues, as well as getting in train an initial meeting between Messrs. Biden and Xi.<br />Chinese officials have asked for the meeting in backchannel outreach, but haven’t made a formal request to the Biden national security team, which is just getting set up in the White House, and other government agencies.<br />One of the people familiar with the discussions said the Chinese have been cautious in engaging with the Biden administration, given the deep divisions between the two nations and Beijing’s wariness of having the offer of a face-to-face meeting rejected.</td>

      <td>Americans observing recent Joe Biden speeches may be relieved to know that not all politicians think parents should have to wait another 100 days before their kids are allowed back into classrooms. Understanding that few teachers and even fewer students are at high risk from Covid-19, Iowa’s governor is determined to let kids learn in school. The encouraging reform idea is to let parents decide both where their children attend school and whether they want in-person instruction.<br />Rod Boshart and Erin Murphy report from Des Moines for the Quad City Times:<br />The pending legislative action follows last week’s Condition of the State Address, when Gov. Reynolds declared:<br />Hear, hear. Distance learning simply doesn’t work for many children, and state data strongly suggests that Iowa’s teaching population is not elderly—the average level of experience is around 14 years.<br />As for Gov. Reynolds, her good sense appears to extend beyond education. The latest fiscal policy report card from the liberty lovers at the Cato Institute gives her a flat A and the second highest score among governors. She trails only New Hampshire’s exemplary Chris Sununu. According to Cato’s report card for Gov. Reynolds:</td>

      <td>Disappointing results bring stock back to where it was before the company announced a spin-off meant to boost growth prospects</td>
      <td>IBM  is learning fast that even ambitious weight loss plans don’t always solve everything.<br />The company more formally known as International Business Machines posted disappointing fourth-quarter results late Thursday. Revenue slipped across the company’s business lines, though the most painful miss came in Big Blue’s cloud and cognitive software segment, which saw revenue fall 4.5% year over year to $6.8 billion. That was well below the $7.3 billion Wall Street had been expecting for a key business unit that had been showing steady growth of late. The Dow component’s share price sunk 10% on Friday in its worst post-earnings reaction in at least five years, according to FactSet.<br />Friday’s selloff also takes the stock back to its levels from before the company announced a plan in October to spin off a major part of its services business in order to focus more on growth areas such as cloud computing. That gave a boost to the shares, on the belief that a smaller, more-focused IBM would be able to regain some growth momentum. But that deal isn’t expected to be completed until much later this year, and IBM has yet to share the financial details of what the remaining company will look like. In the meantime, analysts are growing more skeptical about IBM’s promise that it can grow post-spin revenue in the mid-single-digit range. David Vogt of  UBS  called the target “lofty” in a note to clients Friday.<br />At less than 11 times forward earnings, IBM is the cheapest stock among tech companies valued at more than $100 billion, according to FactSet. But valuation alone won’t sell the stock in a market that favors growth prospects above all. IBM’s market value is now below that of  Zoom Video Communications —a company that generates less than 3% of IBM’s revenue. In such a market, it will take more than a radical diet for Big Blue to get back some sizzle.<br />Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</td>
