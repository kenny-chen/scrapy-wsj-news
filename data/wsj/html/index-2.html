      <td>As legislation moves to President Biden’s desk, more companies are expected to consider giving the day off to employees</td>
      <td>The House voted 415-14 to make June 19, or Juneteenth, a national holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S., the first new federal holiday created by Congress in nearly four decades.<br />Cheers broke out across the House chamber late Wednesday, as Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D., Texas), the bill’s sponsor, read the final vote tally. The Senate unanimously passed the bill Tuesday, and President Biden is expected to sign it.<br />The law would give the day the same status as Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving and other federal holidays.<br />Congressional leaders from both parties said that establishing the holiday was an important gesture in recognizing those who suffered under American slavery and as an act of racial reconciliation. Juneteenth would be the first federal holiday to be created by Congress since 1983, when lawmakers designated the third Monday in January as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, in honor of the slain civil-rights leader.<br />Juneteenth—also known as Emancipation Day, Black Independence Day and Jubilee Day—marks the 1865 date when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived with federal troops in Galveston, Texas, and issued an order freeing the nation’s last slaves. The ratification of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in December 1865 abolished slavery throughout the entire country.</td>

The candidates made their pitch for why they should lead the city while taking flak from their opponents.<br />When asked about street homelessness, former presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang said he believed there should be more psychiatric-ward beds for those who need it. City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who has highlighted his government experience while campaigning, ridiculed Mr. Yang for not having any sense of the cost of such a plan.<br />“That is the greatest non-answer I’ve ever heard in all of our debates,” he said. “Not one specific idea, not one specific plan.”<br />Throughout the two-hour debate, the candidates tried to differentiate themselves on a range of topics, from the desegregation of schools to affordable housing.</td>

      <td>Condé Nast has agreed to its first contract with unionized employees at the New Yorker and two other publications, marking the media company’s first labor agreement in its history and averting a threatened strike after 2½ years of negotiations.<br />The three-year deal, which also covers staffers at music website Pitchfork and technology publication Ars Technica, raises the salary floor to $60,000 in the final year of the contract, places a cap on healthcare cost increases and establishes a defined 40-hour workweek. It also includes stipulations that employees can be fired only for cause, an issue that had been a sticking point in the contract talks.<br />“Thanks to our members’ hard work, the era of at-will employment and wage stagnation at the New Yorker is finally over,” said Natalie Meade, unit chair of the New Yorker Union. “Throughout two and half years of negotiations, our union remained steadfast in our commitment to improve the quality of life for ourselves and for future employees.”<br />The deal comes amid a continuing wave of labor organizing in media companies around the country over the past several years, from digital startups to legacy news organizations like Condé Nast that had never before had unions. Editorial employees at The Wall Street Journal have been unionized since 1937.<br />Tensions around the New Yorker Union negotiations had risen in recent months after unionized employees voted to authorize a strike in March. Earlier in June, dozens of Condé Nast employees picketed outside the Manhattan home of Global Chief Content Officer Anna Wintour. Ms. Wintour, the longtime editor in chief of Vogue magazine, has gained a more expansive leadership role across Condé Nast in recent years but doesn’t oversee the New Yorker, which is led by Editor David Remnick.</td>

      <td>AUSTIN, Texas—The state will begin efforts to build its own wall along its border with Mexico, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Wednesday, saying the state was prompted to take action since President Biden has pulled back on former President Donald Trump’s border wall plans.<br />The state will use an initial $250 million of state funds to explore how to build the wall. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, said building a wall along  areas of the border that don’t yet have one would allow state police to arrest and jail immigrants who cross it on trespassing charges. He said he would build more jails along the southern border to hold such people. States don’t have authority to enforce federal immigration laws.<br />Mr. Abbott’s announcement came days after Mr. Biden’s administration said it would rescind funding for segments of a border wall allocated under Mr. Trump, and would explore returning to landowners property the federal government seized for the project. Mr. Abbott criticized Mr. Biden for not continuing work on the border wall, which had been the central promise of Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.<br />“Because they are not doing it, Texas taxpayers are having to step up,” Mr. Abbott said. Further money, he said, may come from private donations the state is now collecting via a website. Mr. Abbott called a surge of immigration at the southern border an “invasion” that is causing problems for residents there.<br />The League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation’s largest Latino civil rights organization, indicated in a news release that it intends to fight Mr. Abbott’s move in court. Domingo Garcia, LULAC’s national president, called the effort a waste of taxpayer money and an illegal use of state powers.</td>

The prosecution said publicity in the case was so widespread that any jurisdiction in Minnesota would have been exposed to the same amount of media coverage and that the jurors were told to avoid media of any kind during the trial.<br />Mr. Nelson also alleged that Mr. Mitchell had shown bias in his media appearances and had failed to disclose that he had attended a rally in Washington last August during which he wore a T-shirt that said “Get Your Knee Off Our Necks” and “BLM,” which stands for Black Lives Matter.<br />The questionnaire asked if Mr. Mitchell had attended any antipolice rallies in Minneapolis. He said in interviews that he considered the march in Washington to be a civil-rights march, marking the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I have a dream” speech. He also told local media he doesn’t remember owning or wearing the shirt.</td>

      <td>Attorney general vacates decisions in two cases involving domestic and gang violence for applicants</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday overturned two cases decided by the Trump administration Justice Department that made immigrants fleeing domestic or gang violence in their home countries generally ineligible for asylum in the U.S.<br />In the first case, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had ruled in 2018 that domestic and gang violence are forms of private criminal activity generally not covered by asylum laws. In the second case, then-Attorney General Bill Barr in 2019 had stated that membership in a family—such as one being targeted by a gang or drug cartel—also generally couldn’t qualify someone for a grant of asylum.<br />Messrs. Sessions and Barr had overturned decisions made by the Board of Immigration Appeals, an internal Justice Department body that acts as an appeals court for the immigration-court system. Unlike most other courts, immigration courts are run by the Justice Department and their rulings can be overturned by political officials.<br />The Trump administration repeatedly said it believed migrants were taking advantage of expansive U.S. asylum laws, and officials took many steps to narrow eligibility to deter more migrants from coming. The Biden administration has been undoing those changes, and administration officials have said they are working on new rules through a federal regulation to more specifically define who can qualify for asylum.<br />Mr. Garland’s decisions return asylum laws on gang and domestic violence to their parameters before the Trump administration.</td>

      <td>Central bank is warily watching whether the public’s expectations of inflation are starting to head up</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve is sticking to its story. The factors that drove annual core inflation up to a near-30-year high of 3.8% in May are largely “transitory,” it said Wednesday.<br />Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the point several times in his press conference: “Our expectation is these high inflation readings…will start to abate.” The used-car price surge will reverse as that for lumber already did, he said. Fed officials expect inflation to slow from 3.4% at the end of this year to 2.1% by the end of next year and 2.2% by the end of 2023. The last two figures are each up just a tenth of a percentage point from their March forecast.<br />But beneath the surface, some anxiety is creeping in. In March, just five of 18 Federal Open Market Committee participants thought risks to inflation were weighted to the upside. In June, that had risen to 13. In other words, a solid majority of Fed officials think inflation is more likely to turn out higher rather than lower than projected.<br />Those shifting risks made their way into officials’ views on rates. The median projection is now for a half-percentage-point rate increase by the end of 2023, compared with the March expectation of no change. Why are officials in a greater hurry to raise rates now than in March given how little their forecasts changed? Mr. Powell said it was a matter of confidence. The Fed had laid out two conditions for eventually raising interest rates: inflation sustainably at 2% and expected to run moderately above that, and full employment. Many officials “are more comfortable that the economic conditions in [their] forward guidance will be met sooner than previously anticipated,” he said. “And that would be a welcome development.”<br />That said, it appears their confidence in hitting the inflation goal has gone up more than their confidence in hitting the full-employment goal. In fact, taken at face value, the inflation goal may have already been hit. Inflation is now above 2%, and expected to be moderately above that for the next few years.</td>

      <td>Renewables show again that they aren’t reliable to power the grid.</td>
      <td>Electric grid operators in Texas and California are again urging residents to conserve power amid a sweltering heat wave to avoid blackouts. Keeping your thermostat at 78 degrees during the summer may be the green new normal.<br />The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot) warned this week that a large number of unexpected power plant outages combined with surging demand is straining the grid. Meantime, California’s Independent System Operator forecast that electricity demand might exceed supply several days this week. For residents in both states, this must feel like deja vu.<br />Last August Californians experienced rolling blackouts amid a heat wave that engulfed the Southwest. California generates half of its electricity from solar during summer afternoons, but it didn’t have enough power in the evenings when the sun faded. It also relies heavily on imports, but other states didn’t have power to spare.<br />Now the problem is reoccurring while a severe drought also limits hydropower. In a few years the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant is scheduled to retire. The plant provides nearly 10% of the state’s power and backs up intermittent renewables. But green groups want the grid to run completely on solar, wind and batteries. Blackouts could soon become as common as wildfires.<br />Californians who have moved to Texas are discovering that electric power is as green and flaky there too. Texas has drawn scores of wind developers cashing in on the federal renewable electricity production tax credit, which pays them for each unit of power they generate regardless of whether it’s needed.</td>

These progressives want to scrap the consumer-welfare standard that Robert Bork helped develop in the 1970s. They believe antitrust law should focus on business size rather than how its conduct or acquisitions affect consumers.<br />In a 2017 Yale Law Journal article, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” Ms. Khan argued that the “consumer welfare” standard is “unequipped to capture the architecture of market power in the modern economy.” Amazon, she said, increased its dominance by charging lower prices and growing its business, thereby undercutting competitors.<br />Amazon and other tech giants deserve antitrust scrutiny for some of their business practices, such as Amazon’s dominance in e-books. But that e-book dominance was abetted by a Justice antitrust suit that undermined competition from  Apple .  Killing the consumer-welfare standard would punish companies for reducing prices and innovating.<br />Some Republicans, frustrated by how companies have silenced conservatives, voted to confirm Ms. Khan to send a message. Yet they may not have done so had they known Ms. Khan would lead the agency. It’s de rigueur for a President when nominating members to independent agencies to announce at the same time if someone will serve as chair.</td>

The findings on Mexico’s worst subway accident in 45 years also put Mexico’s foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard in the spotlight, as he served as Mexico City mayor during the construction of the line.<br />Flaws in construction included the lack of bolts, badly executed or unfinished soldering, loss of shape on beams and the use of different types of concrete, according to the report by Norwegian consulting firm DNV.<br />Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said the subway line, which has been closed since the collapse, will be repaired to reinforce its structure. Two additional, more complete reports will be released in the coming months, she said.<br />It wasn’t immediately clear whether authorities would impose fines or other sanctions on the construction firms. Line 12 was built by a group formed by Grupo Carso’s construction unit Cicsa, Mexican construction company ICA and France’s  Alstom .

But the whole tempest plops into a teapot once you ask yourself: How much of the total growth in the value of my home, retirement funds and business did I pay federal income taxes on last year? The answer is none. Nobody pays federal wealth taxes in America, but ProPublica and its Democratic allies are using stolen tax returns to try to change that.<br />ProPublica’s report claiming the wealthiest 25 people only pay 3.4% in income taxes contradicts publicly available Internal Revenue Service data on the top 400 income earners showing that they paid on average 32% of their income in federal income taxes, including Social Security and Medicare taxes. That same data show that the very top earners pay an effective income-tax rate of 40.1%. The rate is lower for the top 400 taxpayers because each of these individuals is a unique case in terms of how they earn income and how much they give away.<br />The stolen IRS data provide the story with voyeur appeal, but it turns out to be a bait-and-switch. ProPublica substitutes a magazine’s estimate of wealth appreciation, which never appears on the stolen tax returns, to falsify income. Using this deception the site calculates its “true tax rate.” ProPublica laments that taxpayers are acting “perfectly legally” in not paying a federal wealth tax, which doesn’t exist.<br />That wealth is taxed only when converted into income or on death may be an outrage to those in government who want to spend that wealth, but it is a purposeful, enlightened policy that lets wealth work as the nation’s seed corn, making America the richest nation in the history of the world. That wealth in turn makes it possible for the government today to provide $45,000 a year in transfer payments to the average household in the bottom 20% of American earners.<br />ProPublica highlights Warren Buffett, and they could have picked no better example of how this nation became wealthy. Famous for being the world’s greatest investor—and for living relatively modestly—he uses  McDonald’s  coupons, works in a cheap office, drives a junker and lives in a house far smaller than what he could afford. No one ever seems to ask: If Mr. Buffett isn’t benefiting from all his wealth, who is? It is at this point in the story that greed causes ProPublica and the Democrats to put their own political aspirations above the public interest.</td>

      <td>Journalists used to aspire to objectivity. Now they barely even bother to pretend.</td>
      <td>The media faces a growing crisis of confidence. Only 9% of Americans told Gallup last September that they have “a great deal” and 31% “a fair amount” of “trust and confidence” in the mass media to report the news “fully, accurately and fairly.” And does anyone doubt that those numbers have dropped since then?<br />Writing in these pages, Gerard Baker documented several recent examples of journalistic malfeasance, including Jeffrey Toobin’s re-emergence on CNN and new Pulitzer prizes awarded for “advocacy of approved causes.” Let me add two more instances that grabbed my attention.<br />One is the June 7 Washington Post story by Yeganeh Torbati on Republican governors who ended the $300-a-week unemployment bonus originally set to run through Sept. 6. They acted after local businesses reported difficulty finding workers. More evidence came in April, when job vacancies hit 9.3 million while only 6.6 million Americans were looking for work.<br />Ms. Torbati’s piece was titled “GOP governors are cutting unemployment aid. Some have ties to businesses that may benefit.” She unsubtly accused four governors of ending the benefits to enrich themselves, since they or their families own businesses that are looking for workers. These include resorts, an agricultural enterprise and an air-conditioning wholesaler, the last with 19 employees.<br />Ms. Torbati lists two other Republican governors who ended the additional unemployment-insurance benefits and lack what she called “any apparent relevant business interests.” Presumably so did the 19 other unnamed GOP governors who have discontinued the bonus. Applying the Torbati standard, can Republican governors show they’re not basing decisions on “personal connections to businesses that are trying to find workers” only if they pursue policies that harm the economy and discourage people from working?</td>

      <td>The devaluing of parental care leaves society—and its children—unprepared to deal with stressful events.</td>
      <td>There’s a consensus that the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns have created a mental-health crisis, as increasing numbers of children and adolescents suffer with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. It’s more accurate to say that Covid exacerbated a crisis that was already building.<br />Although children and teens need better mental-health care, the way to protect children’s mental well-being in the long term is strong parental care from an early age. Many stressors play a role in the current mental health crisis: academic and social pressure, unrealistic parental expectations, political and financial instability, the overpowering presence of social media and other technology, and the loss of community in favor of individualism.<br />Yet adversity will always exist. Previous generations faced poverty, unemployment, war and racial injustice. So why is the current adversity causing so much mental distress? A major reason is that we have devalued the work of parents. Mothers and fathers are less present for their children physically and emotionally, starting in early childhood and throughout adolescence, and this diminishes a child’s resilience and emotional fortitude throughout life, resulting in more mental-health problems in adolescence and adulthood.<br />Children aren’t born resilient but neurologically and emotionally fragile. Neuroscience research over the past 30 years has demonstrated how vulnerable an infant’s developing brain is to stress. Studies suggest that early maternal care has long-term effects on stress regulation and resilience, and that attachment patterns formed in early childhood are enduring and long-lasting.<br />Parents expect that children “will be fine,” as one patient told me when she planned on dropping her 6-week-old infant in daycare so she could return to her job. That’s a delusion. Children acutely need parents more than ever in the first three years, and daycare is usually a bad environment for this age group. The behavioral and emotional patterns children develop in early childhood are enduring, and if they are disrupted, that often causes mental-health disturbances down the line.</td>

      <td>I cheered China on in 2008. Now I know better—and my brother is in a prison camp.</td>
      <td>I cheered China on from Wuhan in 2008, when Beijing hosted the Summer Olympics. Thirteen years later, I’m advocating for the 2022 Winter Olympics to be relocated from Beijing, and for a diplomatic boycott if that option fails. My position shifted drastically because China, a country I hoped would move in a more democratic direction, instead has reached new levels of cruelty. The government has subjected my brother, Ekpar Asat, to the torture of indefinite solitary confinement, far from home, in the notorious Aksu prison camps.<br />In 2008 I was among the few Uyghur students in Wuhan. I remember waking up early to watch the Olympic torch relay. But Uyghurs located closer to the games weren’t as lucky. Authorities expelled them from Beijing in China’s so-called cleanup before the games. Somehow I still believed China was making progress and would be open to democratization. But after the July 2009 Urumqi uprising led to the mass imprisonment of protesters, the crackdown on Chinese lawyers, the rollout of the “Strike Hard Campaign,” and the imprisonment of Ilham Tohti, my hopes fizzled. My worst fears were realized in the spring of 2016 when my brother, a prominent tech entrepreneur, disappeared after returning from a U.S. State Department exchange program. In January 2019, he was transferred from a concentration camp to the Aksu prison camp.<br />The world seems to forget that China broke its promises related to the Beijing 2008 Olympics and is committing atrocities against the Uyghur and other Turkic communities in plain sight. The International Olympic Committee postponed last year’s Summer Olympics because of Covid. Why can’t it delay or move next year’s games instead of holding them in a country that is locking up millions of people in camps where torture, forced sterilization, rape and starvation are the norm?<br />The IOC has deflected criticism by claiming that political concerns taint the spirit of the Olympics. But how are concerns for victims of genocide political? Despite touting “universality and solidarity” as its principles, the IOC refuses to stand in solidarity with those being denied their universal human rights. Allowing Beijing to host the Olympics without protest will solidify global complicity in its genocide while bolstering the Chinese Communist Party’s international standing and allowing it to profit from its repressive policies.<br />American corporations’ history of proclaiming their human-rights values when convenient and shying away when there’s a financial risk involved suggests they won’t be on the right side of history either. Corporations that objected to Georgia’s new voting laws have been notably silent about China’s concentration camps. Coca-Cola is a sponsor of the Beijing Olympic games. Another major sponsor,  Airbnb ,  allows Chinese listings to ban Uyghur renters.</td>

      <td>When our ancestors made the switch from four legs to two, they freed up their hands—but there was an evolutionary price to pay.</td>
      <td>The list is long: How culture made us human. How language made us human. Ditto for sociability, cooperation, religion, tools, consciousness, rationality, domestication, cooking, war, predation, child care, empathy, imagination and, of course, that perennial answer, God. To these, I am delighted to add walking. Jeremy DeSilva, an associate professor of anthropology at Dartmouth, makes the case in “First Steps: How Upright Walking Made Us Human.”<br />Mr. DeSilva, who specializes in paleoanthropology and anatomy, particularly the skeletal structure of the human foot and lower leg, will disabuse anyone who thinks that scientists who fuss around with old bones are tedious fossils themselves. Rather than trudging doggedly through the paths that eventuated in Homo sapiens, “First Steps” takes an adventurous, thoughtful and even joyous romp through its subject while proposing new views on our curious insistence on standing up for ourselves.<br />When my first child started to walk, I was entranced. When my second followed suit, I fantasized putting a brick in her diaper, having learned how difficult it is to care for a mobile primate. Why, then, do parents celebrate when their would-be toddler first begins to toddle? Quite possibly because there is something about walking upright that really does make us distinctly human. We are the only mammal that walks, jogs and runs on two legs—and, accordingly, we pride ourselves on standing tall.<br />Incorporating evidence from paleontology, physical anthropology, developmental psychology, molecular genetics and ecology, Mr. DeSilva strides confidently across some otherwise difficult conceptual and historical terrain, including the work of current researchers who have contributed to our understanding of when, why and how we reared up and stayed that way.<br />The book is rich in hitherto obscure insights: “A paleoanthropologist’s best digging tool is last season’s rain, which washes away sediment and gently exposes buried bone.” Mr. DeSilva’s recounting of how we became human is cleverly interwoven with a personal narrative concerning his own research trips, discoveries, and encounters with other paleoanthropologists. Along the way he gently exposes what we know, along with what we don’t.</td>

      <td>West Virginia Democrat’s proposal aims to attract GOP votes for overhaul of how U.S. handles elections</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) laid out what he would like to see in sweeping elections legislation, aiming to stake out a position he hopes could draw bipartisan support while including provisions each party has long opposed.<br />Mr. Manchin has become the deciding swing vote on his party’s most ambitious agenda items. His proposal, which he has shared with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and other Democrats, reflects support for some core measures of Democrats’ “For the People Act”—which faces a test vote on the Senate floor next week—such as mandating at least 15 days of continuous, early voting and automatic voter registration for anyone with a driver’s license. He also endorsed making Election Day a national holiday and forcing the disclosure of large donations to politically active groups that currently aren’t subject to such disclosure requirements.<br />Republicans at the state and federal level have opposed many of these ideas before. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has said that the “For the People Act,” which includes some of Mr. Manchin’s provisions, "is not about anything other than trying to help the Democrats win elections in perpetuity.”<br />Democrats say restrictive voting laws passed by Republican-dominated state legislatures aim to prevent Democratic and minority-group voters from casting ballots.<br />Mr. Manchin’s plan is at odds with some core features of the Democratic bill, a version of which passed the House in March almost entirely on party lines. Mr. Manchin wants to preserve the ability of states to require voters to verify their identities, while Democratic legislation would greatly loosen voter ID requirements by allowing a voter to sign a statement attesting to his or her identity instead of presenting an identification card.</td>

Officials look at a range of indicators, including the number of jobs created and the share of the adult population either working or looking for a job.<br />The rapid rise in retirements translates to fewer people available to work—meaning the labor market could hit the full employment threshold at lower levels of employment and a lower labor-force participation rate than before the pandemic.</td>

      <td>New York<br />With the introduction in the late 19th century of low-cost, handheld cameras, amateur photographers quickly began to outnumber professionals. Societies of enthusiasts sprang up by the hundreds around the world, offering classes, publishing newsletters, awarding prizes. Several of these clubs, such as the Photo League in New York City, shaped the course of 20th-century art.<br />One influential group of amateurs, which few outside South America have known much about until recently, is the subject of the compact but illuminating exhibition “Fotoclubismo: Brazilian Modernist Photography, 1946-1964” at the Museum of Modern Art.<br />Founded in 1939, with fewer than a hundred members, the Foto-Clube Bandeirante (FCB) was headquartered in downtown São Paulo’s first skyscraper. By 1946, after the club had added a cinema and a “women’s” division, it became the Foto-Cine Clube Bandeirante (FCCB) and held salons that accommodated Pictorialists as well as an avant-garde. (“Bandeirantes” means “standard bearers” in Portuguese, but also, more odiously, is the term for 18th- and 19th-century Brazilian expeditions launched to enslave indigenous people. These photographers saw themselves as pioneers and adopted the swaggering word into their club name because at the time it wasn’t considered as offensive as it is now.)<br />MoMA’s curator Sarah Hermanson Meister has concentrated on the photographers, and on the postwar decades when São Paulo swelled into a megacity. The show examines how one FCCB faction interpreted its country’s transformation through the lens of European and American Modernism, building on an imported stylistic framework with its own resourceful panache.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve policy makers have pushed up the timeline on when they expect to start raising interest rates. That probably had more to do with the progress the U.S. has made in the fight against Covid-19 than worries about inflation.<br />Following its two-day meeting, the Fed’s policy-setting committee on Wednesday left its target range on overnight rates where it has been since the pandemic struck last year: right near zero. The most significant changes to the postmeeting statement from the previous one were an acknowledgment that vaccinations have reduced the spread of Covid-19 and an expectation that the effects of the economy’s crisis will continue to moderate.<br />As for inflation, the change in wording was so slight you could have easily missed it. The statement previously said, “With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.” In its place, it now refers to “inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal.”<br />Considering that the most recent reading of the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation showed consumer prices 3.6% above their year-earlier level in April, and that it likely was hotter still in May, it is a wording shift that the Fed couldn’t help but make. It still underscores the fact that for years, inflation consistently fell short of the 2% the Fed has been aiming for.<br />Other than that, the statement repeated the view that the recent rise in inflation largely reflects “transitory factors,” something that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated in his postmeeting press conference.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Bipartisan legislation to curb the market power of big technology companies faced a new hurdle Wednesday, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) criticizing the bills introduced last week.<br />Mr. McCarthy’s opposition widens a GOP divide over the proposals—which has been the aim of tech industry lobbyists seeking to derail legislation that threatens the businesses of some of America’s largest companies,  Amazon.com Inc.,   Facebook Inc.,   Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and  Apple Inc.<br />“Industry lobbyists in Washington are going absolutely crazy,” said Rep. Lance Gooden (R., Tex.), who supports the proposals. “I have received text messages and calls, some friendly and some not, but all very much against these bills.”<br />At a news conference Wednesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) stood with lawmakers from both parties and called the bills “a bipartisan plan to level the playing field for innovators, entrepreneurs and start-ups.”<br />He said he expected the committee to consider approving the bills next week, paving the way for a vote by the full House.</td>

      <td>General Motors Co.  is raising its investment in electric vehicles—the second boost in recent months—and pushing deeper into battery production, making it the latest global auto maker to accelerate its transition to plug-in cars.<br />The company also raised its guidance for pretax profit excluding one-time items for the first half of this year, to between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion, compared with its prior forecast of $5.5 billion. GM attributed the improved outlook to continued strength in the U.S. vehicle market and progress combating the semiconductor shortage that has stymied global vehicle production this year.<br />GM said Wednesday that it will spend $35 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, about 30% higher than a target set last November. The increase reflects plans to add two more battery factories in the U.S., joining a plant under construction in Ohio and another slated for Tennessee.<br />Chief Executive Mary Barra said GM is moving faster because the company perceives momentum building for electric-vehicle adoption in the U.S. and has seen a positive response to the future models it has shown.<br />GM and other car companies have been steadily raising their bets on electric cars in the face of stiffening tailpipe-emissions regulations globally. The moves, which at times seem like dueling declarations, also have attracted investors eager to tap the growth potential of battery-powered vehicles.</td>

      <td>WHY DID the fig ask the raisin out? Because he couldn’t get a date.<br />That joke featured on a Valentine’s Day card I received in elementary school and, oddly, never forgot. But I don’t think I entirely got the joke until recently, when I tasted a Barhi date. It was soft and lusciously sweet, more like a caramel than a piece of fruit. No wonder the fig in the joke thought he was settling.<br />The fruit of the date palm is eaten fresh, semi-dried and dried. In the Middle East, ancient nomads relied on it as a highly portable source of concentrated flavor and nutrients (potassium and magnesium, among others). Today, hosts offer a platter of dates, with small cups of Arabic coffee, to welcome guests in homes, offices, even gyms. Varieties number in the dozens, from the small, chewy Ajwa to the cone-shaped Sukkari, also known as the Royal Date.<br />In the U.S., unless you live in Southern California and can find them at a farmers’ market, only two types are widely available in grocery stores: semi-soft, slightly dry Deglets and oblong, candy-sweet Medjools. Colleen Sundlie, founder of Date Lady, a purveyor of fresh Barhi dates as well as date syrups and sauces, called this dearth of date varieties the (sad) equivalent of selling only Red Delicious and Granny Smith apples.<br />You can find high-quality dates (see “Where to Buy,” below), and when you do, stock up: This fruit freezes beautifully. Date Lady’s Barhi dates have replaced chocolate as my afternoon pick-me-up. Dates also play well with savory foods, such as bacon and prosciutto, rich cheeses and, surprisingly, celery. And in baking, dates offer a step up—as the old joke goes—from the humdrum raisin.</td>

Now you’re just an overdressed, over-the-hill, saggy-assed sad sack married to yesterday’s news.”<br />When her ballet class closes—the studio is a victim of a wave of development her husband opposes in his campaign for public office—she turns to aerobics at the local mall.

Houlihan’s expression of innocence came against the backdrop of increasingly sensitive drug tests that some say are snagging innocent athletes along with cheaters.<br />“I have never taken any performance-enhancing substances,” Houlihan said. She added: “The most likely explanation was a burrito purchased and consumed approximately 10 hours before that drug test from an authentic Mexican food truck that serves pig offal near my house in Beaverton, Ore.” Eating pork can lead to false positives for the substance found in her sample—a steroid called nandrolone—she said she’d learned.<br />In the two days since, however, a new fact came to light that muddies her explanation: Houlihan herself isn’t sure she ate the pork burrito in question.<br />Houlihan’s lawyer, Paul J. Greene, confirmed in a Wednesday interview something first reported by the website LetsRun: that Houlihan actually ordered a carne asada burrito, not pork, the day before her drug test. They believe Houlihan was either given the wrong order or a burrito that included pork, Greene said. They don’t know for sure.</td>

The company is moving the Odyssey’s sailing out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to July 31 from July 3 “out of an abundance of caution,” Mr. Bayley said.<br />The crew members’ cases come after two passengers sharing a room on the Celebrity Millennium, another Royal Caribbean ship, tested positive last week for Covid-19, though the cruise sailed on. Cruise operators are hoping to show they have protocols in place to handle Covid cases, in contrast to some high-profile outbreaks that brought sailings to a halt last year.<br />Six of the Odyssey crew members are asymptomatic, while the other two have mild symptoms, Mr. Bayley said. All crew members are quarantining for 14 days with routine testing, he said. The company will also delay a test voyage on the ship scheduled for late June.<br />All 1,400 crew members on the ship were vaccinated on June 4 and will be considered fully vaccinated on June 18, Mr. Bayley said. The cases were detected after the vaccination was given and before they were fully effective, he added.</td>

The balloons started at least 20 wildfires. Hamas said it launched those balloons as a pre-emptive warning to Israel for allowing a nationalist flag march through the contested city of Jerusalem on Tuesday.<br />An Israeli military spokesman said Israel holds Hamas, which rules Gaza, responsible for all events happening in the Palestinian territory. “The Israeli military is prepared for any scenario, including a resumption of hostilities,” the spokesman said.<br />The violence illustrates a dangerous new dynamic in the decadeslong conflict between Israel and Hamas, one that threatens to engulf the new Israeli government sworn in just days ago. How the new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, handles the situation could affect the government’s broad coalition, which includes for the first time in Israel’s history an independent Arab party. The government is already under pressure by opposition lawmakers from former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party to respond with more force.</td>

The private sector doesn’t make enough of these investments to reverse long-term, structural economic challenges, such as falling labor-force participation and wage inequality, Ms. Yellen said.<br />“We need to make these investments at some point, and now is fiscally the most strategic time to make them,” she said.<br />Ms. Yellen also said the administration was carefully monitoring inflation, but reiterated that she saw current price pressures as transitory while the pandemic eased and the economy continued to reopen.<br />The White House budget projected the consumer-price index would rise 2.1% in 2021, but those forecasts were prepared in mid-February, Ms. Yellen said, before economic activity had picked up.</td>

      <td>Biden wants to soak the rich, but the middle class will notice when firms return less to shareholders.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration has released a flurry of tax proposals, including a headline-grabbing tax hike on capital gains that would apply retroactively from April. Dividends would be subject to the same treatment, according to a recently released Treasury Department document.<br />For taxpayers with adjusted gross income of more than $1 million, the proposal would tax qualified dividends—dividends from shares in domestic corporations and certain foreign corporations that are held for at least a specified minimum period of time—at income-tax rates (currently up to 40.8%) rather than the lower capital-gains rates (23.8%). At first sight, it is easy to be distracted by the $1 million figure and surmise that only rich people will be affected, so who cares? But the harms go further than that.<br />The research we have points to a negative relationship between dividend taxes and dividend payments. A 2005 paper by economists Raj Chetty and Emmanuel Saez looked at the effect of the 2003 dividend tax cuts on dividend payments in the U.S. The authors “find a sharp and widespread surge in dividend distributions following the tax cut,” after a continuous two-decade decrease in distributions. They found that these payments were regular and recurrent, rather than a one-time increase. Firms that were already paying dividends also increased the amount they were paying after the tax cut. That means shareholders of all income levels received more in dividends.<br />Princeton’s Adrien Matray and co-author Charles Boissel looked at the issue the other way around. In a 2019 study, they found that an increase in French dividend taxes led to decreased dividend payments. Given an increase in dividend taxes, they argued, firms would prefer to keep the money and use it for investment rather than return it to shareholders. Another study from 2011, looking at America’s major competitor, reached the same directional conclusion: A 2005 reduction in China’s dividend tax rate led to an increase in dividend payments.<br />Thus the effect of a dividend tax increase wouldn’t be limited to millionaires. Internal Revenue Service data show that some 27 million tax filers received qualified dividends in 2018, and more than half had adjusted gross incomes of less than $100,000. Another 27% had an adjusted gross income between $100,000 and $200,000.</td>

      <td>How did the Justice Department recover $2.3 million of the ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline to a group of hackers known as DarkSide? Isn’t bitcoin, the cryptocurrency in which the payment was made, supposed to be untraceable? Actually, no. Bitcoin is anonymous, but it’s far from private—an important but often overlooked distinction. The Justice Department recovered more than $1 billion in bitcoin in various investigations during 2020 alone.<br />The blockchain—bitcoin’s historical ledger of all transactions—is publicly viewable at all times by anyone, so that there can’t be any under-the-table cash transactions. Software firms such as Chainalysis and Elliptic have supported federal investigators with a suite of analysis tools intended to help trace criminals and tax cheats, including those who try to obscure the bitcoin trail through dozens of successive transactions.<br />What complicates recovery is bitcoin’s anonymity. Senders and recipients are denoted by wallet addresses—a string of numbers and letters—rather than names or Social Security numbers. Other cryptocurrencies such as Monero, zCash and Haven are working on technologies that would offer both anonymity and privacy. But even then, users would face the “off-ramp” dilemma.<br />That arises when criminals need to spend their bitcoin or convert it into conventional currency. The final transaction deanonymizes the participant and usually triggers the jurisdiction of one or more government agencies. Thus, once criminals transfer their coins into an exchange wallet—even one that doesn’t adhere to the exchange’s Know Your Customer/Anti-Money-Laundering requirement—investigators have what they need to freeze and ultimately claim those assets. That’s likely what happened in the case of Colonial Pipeline.<br />Traditional currency poses problems of its own for investigators. Bank notes are untraceable unless authorities note the serial numbers in advance. Global banks amassed some $15 billion in fines in 2020 for tacitly enabling money laundering and other financial crimes. Bitcoin’s transparency may do more to mitigate fraud and theft than traditional banking and currency ever could.</td>

      <td>Four stylish women disclose their swimwear non-negotiables—like cuts that make them feel confident in their bodies—and the reliable suits they return to summer after summer</td>
      <td>EACH SUMMER brings a new swim trend, from crochet bikinis with matching wrap skirts to teeny triangle tops with high-contrast trim. But a lot of those splashy fads soon dry up. Twelve months later, once-Instagrammable suits are languishing at the back of your dresser drawer: scrunched up, regretted, never to lounge atop a tippy pool float again.<br />This summer, instead of buying a fleeting style, why not take the time to hunt down a more timeless suit that you have at least a fighting chance of happily wearing for summers to come? Confront yourself with questions that go beyond how many “likes” a suit might yield: Do you honestly prefer a classic maillot over a bikini? Are you concerned about avoiding strappy tan lines? Will you be swimming laps on the daily or sunning yourself in a lounge chair while indulging in your second daiquiri? Take a cue from these four stylish women. Below, they share their swimwear must-haves and the signature suits they rely on year after year.<br />Go-To: Luchia Top, $125, Luchia Bottoms, $135, lemlem.com<br />Staying Power: Of all the different ways that we dress and adorn ourselves, swimwear makes me feel the most vulnerable. It invites all of these questions about the body and presentation. I love a high-waisted bottom and a triangular bikini top. That combination echoes the bathing suits of the 1950s and ’60s. It’s a silhouette that works well on me and makes me feel really confident in my body.<br />Checklist: First, how the suit is made—the thoughtfulness in terms of production and the ethical considerations. Second, the person behind the brand. And then third, how the brand is represented and by whom.</td>

      <td>U.S.-EU truce opens door for heightened competition between plane makers in their respective home markets</td>
      <td>A trans-Atlantic truce over jetliner subsidies sets up  Boeing Co.  and  Airbus SE  for a revitalized battle in their respective home markets, as each maps out strategies to regain ground lost to the pandemic-driven travel slump.<br />The U.S. and the European Union suspended their 17-year-old fight over airliner subsidies, setting aside punitive tariffs each had levied on the other’s plane maker. Both companies had been either absorbing those tariffs or passing them on to customers when they made trans-Atlantic deliveries. The tariffs amounted to 15% of a plane’s price tag.<br />The two sides had suspended tariffs in March as part of talks to resolve the issue. They agreed Tuesday to extend the freeze for another five years. The deal comes just as Boeing starts to deliver its 737 MAX single-aisle jet again. The plane was grounded for more than two years following two deadly accidents that prompted design and training changes.<br />The deal removes the threat of tariffs holding up or blocking deliveries by the two into their rival’s home market at a time when both need sales, said Rob Stallard, aerospace analyst at Vertical Research Partners. The U.S. and European markets are roughly equal in size, each accounting for around a fifth of total orders and deliveries by the two big plane makers.<br />“Given that this was an unnecessary, friendly-fire conflict, ending this trade war is good news” for both, Mr. Stallard said, adding, “The 737 MAX grounding and then the pandemic have meant that new aircraft deliveries have been much lower than they were pre-tariffs in 2018.”</td>

      <td>Software giant plans to double capital expenditures in a very expensive cloud-computing race</td>
      <td>Oracle Corp.  forgot to read the manual about being a safe haven.<br />The 44-year-old enterprise software pioneer has been one of the hottest stocks in technology, with its shares up 27% for the year ahead of its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Tuesday. Some of that strength stems from the market’s rotation out of the sector’s more richly valued names. But many investors are also optimistic that Oracle’s long transition to becoming a cloud software business is finally starting to bear fruit.<br />Results for the quarter ended May 31 helped buttress that view. Revenue rose 7.5% year over year to $11.2 billion, beating Wall Street’s forecasts and showing the company’s best growth since 2012. That helped revenue rise nearly 4% for the full fiscal year, topping $40 billion for the first time. Chief Executive Safra Catz also told analysts during the company’s conference call that growth in the current fiscal year should exceed the rate seen the previous year; analysts had projected a slowdown for fiscal 2022.<br />Still, Oracle’s projection for the current quarter was on the low side of Wall Street forecasts. And the company also plans to lean into its recent cloud momentum by doubling its capital expenditures this year, to around $4 billion.<br />“We are confident that the increased return in the cloud business more than justifies this increased investment and our margins will expand over time,” said Ms. Catz on the company’s conference call Tuesday.</td>

      <td>A mind’s unexpected diminishment grounds a poignant, illuminating portrait of a marriage.</td>
      <td>Can a novel feel too familiar and too close to home to offer the sort of novelty and enlightenment that we seek in fiction? I wondered about this when I picked up “Morningside Heights,” which takes place practically in my backyard on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, is peopled by characters I might run into in Riverside Park, and concerns an incurable disease whose ravages I am all too familiar with from my mother’s long slide into it.<br />I needn’t have worried. Joshua Henkin’s novel is a richly textured family portrait that feels deeply familiar yet profoundly moving and illuminating. As in the best fiction, you come away from “Morningside Heights” reluctantly—attached to its characters and with new understanding of what it is to be a feeling person dealing with life’s unpredictability.<br />Mr. Henkin, who directs Brooklyn College’s MFA program in fiction writing, has published four books over the past two dozen years. Like his best known, “Matrimony” (2007), “Morningside Heights” is a domestic novel—yes, men write sensitive domestic novels, too—which captures the many stages of a couple’s relationship from campus courtship deep into marriage. And like his most recent, “The World Without You” (2012), about a family reeling in the wake of their journalist son’s brutal death in Iraq, it concerns the adaptations that loss necessitates.<br />The focus here is on the in sickness and in health clause of marital vows, which enables Mr. Henkin to plumb the full measure of his characters’ moral fiber. His book succeeds not by dint of dazzling language or narrative sleight of hand, but by his unwavering empathy, which leads him to create remarkably real, complex characters. In fact, he pulls off a woman’s perspective so convincingly that “Morningside Heights” should help quash absurd notions that writers shouldn’t “appropriate” other genders, ethnicities or experiences in their work.<br />As with so many marriage tales, “Morningside Heights” opens with the couple’s origin story. They meet in the 1970s, when the Upper West Side was still seedy. Spence Robin, the youngest English professor ever to receive tenure at Columbia University, was a rising star at 30 when Pru Steiner, six years his junior, entered the doctoral program and took his Shakespeare class. A born-and-bred New York red-diaper baby, Spence changed his name from Shulem in kindergarten and became a stickler about language, along with most everything else. Pru, who grew up in a kosher home outside of Columbus, Ohio, had studied theater as an English major at Yale.</td>

      <td>TOKYO— Toshiba Corp.’s  board chairman, facing opposition from shareholder-advisory firms, said he would consider handing over the reins but only after setting Toshiba on the right path with a revamped board and new CEO.<br />Nonexecutive Chairman Osamu Nagayama is up for re-election at Toshiba’s annual shareholder meeting on June 25 after a turbulent spring that included a chief executive officer’s departure and clashes with foreign-based shareholders. The conflicts deepened after a shareholder-commissioned report on June 10 said company executives and board members worked closely with government officials to thwart the foreign shareholders’ interests.<br />In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Nagayama said he saw it as his mission to fix the industrial conglomerate’s governance problems by bringing in new blood. He said the board needed more people who, like him, have experience running a company, and he said Toshiba needed to find a long-term chief executive to take over from the current CEO, Satoshi Tsunakawa.<br />“These are the two major tasks if I remain as a board member and the chairperson of the board,” Mr. Nagayama said. “When I see the whole thing set in the right order, it’s an appropriate time I consider myself to resign.”<br />Mr. Nagayama, 74 years old, is one of Japan’s most successful executives in dealing with foreign investors. He led a Japanese pharmaceutical company majority-owned by Switzerland’s  Roche Holding AG  and, as nonexecutive chairman of  Sony Corp.  (now Sony Group Corp.) from 2013 to 2019, helped fend off U.S. shareholders’ calls for a breakup and lay the groundwork for Sony’s rise to record profits.</td>

Several electric-vehicle upstarts, inspired by  Tesla Inc.’s  surging valuation, have turned to the public markets for additional funding.<br />The company on Wednesday said it wants to use Waymo Driver technology to move people and goods.

Waymo is conducting tests of its autonomous vehicle technology with riders in San Francisco.<br />For its Waymo Via delivery unit, the company said it has joined with  J.B.

Its clients on a local level include  United Parcel Service Inc.  and  AutoNation Inc.<br />Waymo said existing investors Alphabet, private-equity firm Silver Lake, venture-capital giant Andreessen Horowitz and car-dealership chain AutoNation Inc. participated in the funding round, along with Fidelity Management & Research Co. and others.</td>

      <td>ONE THING THAT strikes you right away about this tuna melt: It’s at least as much melt as it is tuna. “The ratio is about 50/50,” said chef Mona Talbott. “I started making it as a quick and easy weekday dinner. My core pod loved it.”<br />For Ms. Talbott’s final Slow Food Fast recipe, she calls on the expertise of Kate Arding, her partner in Talbott & Arding Cheese and Provisions in Hudson, N.Y., and an authority on farmhouse cheese. The melter here is Lancashire, an English cow’s milk cheese with a mellow, buttery character and lovely lemony tang. Ms. Arding usually keeps a Lancashire in stock at the shop. But if you don’t find this variety at your local cheese counter, a raclette or good aged cheddar will work nicely.<br />Before Ms. Talbott assembles the sandwich, she pre-toasts the bread to get the right crisp texture. She uses high quality tuna preserved in olive oil, and she mixes in finely chopped fennel, pickled jalapeños, fresh parsley and lots of lemon juice. A measured amount of mayo binds the mixture without weighing it down. The open-face sandwiches sit under the broiler until the cheese bubbles and browns in spots.<br />A recipe for a simple sandwich might seem like overkill, but Ms. Talbott’s attention to detail comes through in her instructions—and the final result. “I care a lot about all the nuances and subtleties,” she said. “The work is meaningful if you put care into it. You can taste the difference.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, declared a state of emergency because of the pandemic.<br />All other unpaid city code violations dating back eight years would qualify for a 25% discount. Any accrued interest or similar late fees would be waived.<br />The new 90-day program will go into effect sometime in the new fiscal year beginning in July and can be extended another 90 days. City officials are expecting to collect up to $40 million in unpaid fines through the initiative.</td>

After the measure is rubber stamped at an EU meeting in Brussels on Friday, Americans will be free to visit the 27-nation bloc for the first time since March of last year. The EU last month said it intended to open up to Americans, but hadn’t set a date for when it would become official.<br />Some EU countries heavily dependent on tourism, including Italy and Greece, have already opened to Americans. Mediterranean countries would struggle to absorb another summer with few foreign tourists after last year’s costly lockdowns. Italy, Greece and France all suffered gross domestic product declines of more than 8% in 2020. Spain’s economy shrank by 11%.<br />With the U.S. now on the white list, most restrictions will be removed across the region, though countries can add their own requirements for entry. Most countries are expected to require tourists show either proof of vaccination, a negative Covid-19 test or a document attesting they have recovered from the disease.<br />Japan, Australia, Israel and several other countries are already on the EU white list. Countries added this week with the U.S. include Serbia and Lebanon.</td>

Last week it was Manila and Bangkok. The week before, Kathmandu. And late last month, Jakarta.<br />Chinese vaccines, through a mix of small donations and larger sales contracts, have been a conspicuous part of rollouts in developing countries across Asia in the first half of 2021. Millions of doses have arrived as governments in the West focused on getting their own populations inoculated and Covax, a program backed by the World Health Organization to immunize the world, fell short of its goals.<br />Advanced economies—which bought up large quantities of vaccines—are now pledging to help resource-strapped nations. Leaders of the Group of Seven countries said on Sunday they would share at least 870 million doses directly over the next year. But in the last six months, deliveries of Chinese shots, even if they often arrived in small batches, helped several governments push their vaccination drives forward—and gave Beijing an opportunity to strengthen ties.<br />Indonesia is heavily reliant on shots made by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech Ltd., which account for 89% of the 95 million doses it has received so far. Cambodia has largely used two China-made vaccines to achieve one of the region’s highest inoculation levels, with 18% of its population at least partially vaccinated. After a slow start, the Philippines expects to increase vaccinations with about 10 million doses arriving this month, more than half of which will be Chinese.</td>

The mother claimed allergies; flight attendants said there was nothing they could do.<br />Sick passengers on airplanes have become a deeper concern for travelers during the pandemic, as this scene was for a friend of mine. The controversy around how airlines treat the sick has grown, since they give passengers a big financial incentive to fly while ill.<br />Most carriers in the U.S., and many others around the world, charge fliers the difference in fare between their discounted advance-purchase ticket and a new ticket to travel after illness recovery. That often means a one-way unrestricted walk-up fare, usually hundreds and even thousands of dollars more, which some fliers can’t afford and none are happy to pay.<br />“The pandemic has really underscored the need for a sick-passenger rule,” says Charles Leocha, president of Travelers United, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group. “Something needs to be done to give people an affordable alternative.”<br />He faced the issue when he got sick in Spain four years ago. Delaying his trip home would cost $2,000 in airfare, even though he had a note from the doctor who had just treated him at a hospital for an infectious lung ailment, as well as X-rays. Rather than wait until his fever and cough subsided, he got on the flight—and soon after began advocating for a rule addressing very sick passengers.</td>

      <td>A second solid-state battery startup is coming to the stock market. A lower valuation than the first one reflects investors’ thirst for disruption stories.</td>
      <td>This is still a market that rewards expensive moonshots over incremental technology improvements.<br />The latest electric-vehicle business to announce plans to go public via a special-purpose acquisition company is Solid Power, a Colorado-based developer of next-generation “solid-state” battery technology. On Tuesday,  Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation III  said it would buy Solid Power for $1.2 billion. Including cash from the SPAC and the fundraising held alongside the deal, the combined companies would have a market value of roughly $1.9 billion at the current share price.<br />That is a lot less than the $12.8 billion market value of the other U.S.-listed solid-state battery company. California-based  QuantumScape ,  which merged with a SPAC last year, became an investor darling after reporting some promising test results in December. Around Christmas, its market capitalization exceeded that of  Ford Motor .  The stock has since plummeted as investors have cooled on EV-related startups more generally, but the company is still more highly valued than most pre-revenue peers in the sector.<br />The lithium-ion batteries in today’s smartphones and Teslas contain a potentially flammable liquid electrolyte to ferry lithium ions between the cathode and anode in the charging and discharging process. Solid-state batteries promise to replace the liquid with a solid. While that solves some problems, the industry is particularly excited about the “lithium-metal” anodes that solid electrolytes might enable. These could bring massive theoretical cost savings and make long-range EVs much cheaper than traditional cars.<br />Coming up with a viable material for the solid electrolyte has proved an enormous challenge, though. QuantumScape thinks it has hit on a ceramic that works with a lithium-metal anode, and the test results that it has released are promising, albeit limited. Solid Power is pursuing another electrolyte material called a sulfide, and may be further down the testing route than QuantumScape. But the results it published with lithium-metal anodes were disappointing, so it is working with a more conventional silicon anode as a first step.</td>

U.S. officials were also monitoring the potential for actions at the plant in Guangdong province, about 80 miles west of Hong Kong.<br />Earlier, authorities in Hong Kong and China said there had been no radioactive incidents threatening public safety or the environment. EDF said that according to available data, the plant was operating within safety parameters.<br />The increased radioactivity levels were mainly related to broken fuel rods, China’s ecology ministry said, adding that a small amount of breakage due to manufacturing, transportation and loading was unavoidable.</td>

      <td>Facebook Inc.’s  oversight panel has won credibility for independence after ruling repeatedly against the social-media giant—most recently objecting to its decision to ban indefinitely former President Donald Trump.<br />But board officials and outsiders say the panel’s longer-term impact will hinge more on how Facebook follows up on all the detailed recommendations and guidance the board has issued as part of its decisions. Since it started making rulings on Facebook’s determinations about what content to allow and what to take down, the panel—a 20-member group called the Oversight Board—has decided eight times against Facebook. It backed Facebook’s decisions three times.<br />Those rulings are binding. But the board also issues copious guidance with each ruling, and those recommendations aren’t. The board and outside observers want Facebook to commit to follow those recommendations, too.<br />“There’s a desire to learn more about how these things are implemented and to see that they are,” said John Samples, a member of the Oversight Board and vice president of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank based in Washington, D.C.<br />The board has become a closely watched experiment in corporate governance for online platforms, which have long struggled with the issue of moderating content. Facebook has two billion active users a day, including heads of state and public figures known to post polarizing statements that can go viral on the platform.</td>

      <td>As the mercury rises, consider these decorating tricks—also ideal for summer retreats as well as suburban and city digs</td>
      <td>SINGAPORE’S YEAR-ROUND swelter isn’t that different from the heat in Houston, New Orleans or New York’s subways come July and August. Close to the sea and equator, the island city-state averages temperatures of 88 degrees Fahrenheit, and the relative humidity often reaches a wilting 100%.<br />So a lot of the interior-design decisions made by Elizabeth Hay when kitting out a three-bedroom home for a young family there translate well to summer retreats in the States, and to city digs whose owners want to tweak their winter décor for the steamy season. “It had to read cozy but not stifling,” said Ms. Hay of the plan. The designer, born in Britain and now based in Singapore, reinterpreted her signature lived-in, English cottage aesthetic for a hot and humid Southeast Asian climate. “We wanted it to have lots of personality but also be easy and breezy in terms of everyday living.”<br />The tools in her cooling quiver included materials such as wicker, cane and rattan, which let air circulate, unlike solid, breeze-blocking wood. In the rare instances lumber does appear, light finishes prevail, as in the oak coffee table in the sitting room. Upholstery consists of lightweight linens and cottons that wick heat from the skin.<br />“Anything that ‘feels’ hot, like a thick wool or a nubby fleece, can be quite claustrophobic,” said Ms. Hay. “I purposely didn’t use any stuffy fabrics, like mohair.” You won’t find an itchy Oriental rug here either.<br />Modifying existing architecture to add scallops and arches helped ensure the home feels light and airy. A crisp, soothing palette of primarily blue tones does the same thing. Pink and red are sparingly flicked in.</td>

      <td>China’s recovery from the pandemic relies on the same drivers of growth that powered the country before the pandemic, with the same underlying risks</td>
      <td>The moving parts in China’s latest growth figures are very similar to those in place before the pandemic. Firing up the old industrial model helped the country return to 2019 levels of output while the global economy was still depressed, but it also shows off long-festering fragilities.<br />Chinese economic data for May came in slightly weaker than economists expected, but still seem strong by Western standards. It is best to compare the numbers released on Wednesday to their equivalents from 2019 for a clear picture, since those aren’t distorted by the extremely unusual economic conditions of early 2020. Industrial production is up 13.6% for the first five months of the year, compared with the same period in 2019. On the same basis, retail sales have risen by 9.3%, fixed-asset investment by 8.5%, and real-estate investment by 17.9%.<br />If a recovery led by investment in real estate and industrial production, with consumption lagging behind, sounds familiar, it may be because the same could be said of the makeup of China’s growth before Covid-19. Unlike the U.S., where there are many questions around how the huge stimulus might change the shape of the economy, China has followed a well-established script in its pandemic response.<br />Even the lagging retail-growth figures may exaggerate the underlying strength of the consumer economy relative to previous years. Before the pandemic China typically ran a large travel deficit in its balance of payments, meaning that Chinese travelers spend more outside of the country than visitors to China spend domestically. With the pandemic limiting foreign travel, some portion of that consumption now likely happens at home. That could be true for some time, but presumably won’t be forever.<br />Two concerns with the shape of the recovery are immediately noteworthy. The first, as Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics points out, is that growth in industrial-export sales has slowed. Since the industrial expansion has been driven in large part by exports, a slowdown even from very rapid growth levels might have a material impact.</td>

      <td>SEOUL—Kim Jong Un said his country’s food situation is getting tense, an acknowledgment of the continuing challenges inside North Korea following a year of major flood damage, pandemic shutdowns and ongoing sanctions.<br />Kicking off a plenary session of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party, Mr. Kim urged the country’s leaders to resolve food shortages resulting from lower agricultural output that he attributed largely to crop failures caused by last summer’s typhoons, according to a state-media report out of Pyongyang on Wednesday.<br />“The agricultural sector failed to fulfill its grain production plan,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying.<br />The North Korean leader’s assessment mirrors independent reporting on the Kim regime’s food stability. The impoverished country last year had an estimated food deficit of about 1 million metric tons, a scarcity that equates to the average North Korean eating 445 calories less a day than the 2,100-calorie-diet recommended by the United Nations, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report from January.<br />This year, North Korea could face food shortages of up to 1.35 million tons, according to a May report from the Korea Development Institute, a think tank backed by the South Korean government. The institute’s report estimated the country’s food requirements are about 5.75 million tons annually.</td>

      <td>BEIJING—China’s economic growth moderated in May as flattering comparisons to the pandemic-hit economic figures early last year tapered off and Chinese consumers continued to keep a close eye on their pocketbooks.<br />Factory output, a key growth pillar in China’s pandemic recovery for more than a year, remained resilient last month, but investment and domestic consumption fell short of expectations despite a boost from a long holiday, weighed down by a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections.<br />China’s industrial production rose 8.8% from a year earlier in May, slowing from April’s 9.8% pace, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Wednesday. The reading of factory output, which was buoyed by strong overseas demand for Chinese-made goods, matched the median forecast made by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The key gauge of factory activity was 13.6% higher than the level recorded in May 2019, long before the Chinese economy was hit by the new coronavirus, the statistics bureau said. Officials have been comparing monthly economic data with the same period two years earlier to filter out distortions from last year’s pandemic shock.<br />The double-digit percentage growth compared with pre-virus levels is much higher than the roughly 6% year-over-year expansion that China’s industrial sector was logging each month before the pandemic, underscoring the strength of the current rebound in China’s industrial sector.</td>

Some leases are tied to inflation and many tenants bear a rent increase to avoid the cost of moving. Other industries, such as restaurants and food retail, have more competition and a more price-sensitive consumer.<br />Consumer prices rose 5% in May from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Labor Department, the biggest surge in inflation in nearly 13 years.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Some countries might try to stay outside the emerging agreement to impose a global minimum tax on corporations so those nations can use low tax rates to attract businesses. The Biden administration aims to deflect those attempts with a powerful Shield.<br />The Shield—the Stopping Harmful Inversions and Ending Low-Tax Developments rule—is the administration’s tax threat to the rest of the world, the flip side of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s cooperative diplomacy.<br />The plan, which would require the approval of Congress, aims to leverage the size of the U.S. consumer market to give other countries a choice: impose a minimum tax or watch the U.S. tax your companies and take your revenue. It is an aggressive weapon and one that mirrors how the U.S. changed its tax laws in 2010 to prod foreign banks into identifying Americans’ offshore accounts to the Internal Revenue Service.<br />The Shield faces some significant potential hurdles in Congress, along with likely resistance from foreign governments and multinational businesses.<br />“Instead of this being called the Shield it should be called the sword, because that’s the way it’s intended,” said Bob Stack of Deloitte Tax LLP, who was a Treasury Department international tax official during the Obama administration.</td>

Investors this week are watching for any changes in Fed policy makers’ views on inflation, the labor market, and other economic indicators that may offer hints on when they would begin tapering bond purchases. Data Tuesday showed that retail sales dropped in May while producer prices rose, offering a mixed picture of the recovery.<br />“We’ve had the initial exuberance and we are catching up a little bit to reality. Markets are less liquid—being summertime—and they are also digesting some of this anticipation,” said Shaniel Ramjee, a multiasset fund manager at Pictet Asset Management. “There have been some data points that have come in lower than expected, such as retail sales. It has reduced the cause for concern that the Fed could taper faster than expected.”<br />The Fed will release its latest monetary policy decision at 2 p.m. ET. The central bank will also release individual policy makers’ updated quarterly economic projections. The new forecasts could show officials expecting to raise interest rates sooner than they anticipated in March.

The trade is made possible by a policy meant to shrink the government’s own burden for dealing with mortgages where the homeowner isn’t paying.<br />The so-called early buyout trade, an arcane but lucrative part of the mortgage business, is being employed by many mortgage companies, including the three biggest:  Rocket Cos. ,   PennyMac Financial Services Inc.  and  Wells Fargo  & Co. That has added to what was already a banner stretch for mortgage making, fueled over the past year by refinancings and pandemic-inspired moves to the suburbs.<br />Investors are eager to get their hands on these loans. Many were made long ago and thus carry interest rates that are higher than the going rate. Another appealing factor is that investors believe many of these borrowers are unlikely to refinance in the near term.

That figure is down from an annual average of 1.5 million new units from 1968 to 2000.<br />The 5.5 million-unit deficit includes about two million single-family homes, 1.1 million buildings with two to four units and 2.4 million buildings of at least five units, the report says.<br />“The scale of the problem is so large,” said David Bank, senior vice president of Rosen Consulting Group and one of the report’s authors. “We need affordable [housing], we need market-rate, we need single-family, we need multifamily.”</td>

      <td>TEHRAN—As Iranians prepare to head to the polls on Friday, the only way for the leading moderate candidate to make any headway against the hard-line presidential front-runner is to convince millions of Iranians to bother voting at all.<br />Former central bank chief Abdolnaser Hemmati is pitching himself as a reform-friendly centrist to revive Iran’s relations with the West and allow more personal freedoms, including a more prominent role for women. He is currently polling in the low single digits, with many Iranians saying they will skip the ballot in protest at the way the country is run.<br />But the 64-year-old technocrat said he might be able to build enough momentum to pull off a surprise if he can persuade enough people to vote, despite the hard-line establishment’s attempts to sideline moderate and reformist candidates from a run at the presidency.<br />“Despite what they claim, the group of people running against me in these elections, they don’t believe in good foreign relations,” Mr. Hemmati said in an interview at his campaign office. “They don’t believe in social freedom for the people.”<br />Mr. Hemmati is the only reform-minded candidate left in the five-person race, after the Guardian Council, Iran’s election watchdog, disqualified nearly everyone else, save for one other reformist who pulled out of the contest Wednesday. The disqualifications, including those of prominent centrists, have smoothed the path of the leading ultraconservative, Ebrahim Raisi.</td>

      <td>President Erdogan has demanded rate cuts, but the central bank must contend with inflation</td>
      <td>Any signal that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy on Wednesday could ripple across emerging markets that are dependent on the U.S. dollar. Prime among them is Turkey.<br />The Turkish lira has come under pressure in recent weeks as investors try to assess whether the country’s central bank will heed the demands of its president to cut interest rates. But a rate cut could drag the lira down further at the same time that the country’s high inflation rate is already diminishing the currency’s buying power.<br />Turkey’s economy is among the most vulnerable to signs the Fed is going to raise rates, since a stronger dollar makes it harder for Turkey to pay its foreign-currency debts. The Fed’s next policy decision is due Wednesday, and it is possible that a rate increase will be penciled in sooner than previously expected, in response to the recent jump in inflation. That puts Turkey’s central-bank policy at risk from potential efforts in the U.S. to manage its own inflation conditions down the road.<br />A move toward tighter policy in the U.S. “would be a huge negative surprise for markets and very negative for emerging-market assets,” said Daniel Wood, a portfolio manager at William Blair Investment Management. “Turkey would likely suffer disproportionately given its reliance on strong risk sentiment from international investors.”<br />A stronger dollar would also add further pressure to the Turkish lira. Turkey’s currency hit a record low on June 4, when it fell to 8.7532 lira to the U.S. dollar, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for lower interest rates by July or August. That has left investors to assess whether the country’s central bank will heed Mr. Erdogan’s demands.</td>

To test that and other bold healthcare ideas, it took over clinics that catered to its employees and built a team with scores of clinicians, engineers, product designers and others.<br />Today those ambitions, which aren’t widely known, have largely stalled as Apple has shifted the focus of its health unit to something it knows well: Selling devices, specifically the Apple Watch, according to people familiar with its strategy.<br />The new primary-care service hasn’t gotten off the ground, people familiar with it say. A digital health app launched quietly this year has struggled to keep users engaged, say people familiar with the app and the documents seen by the Journal. Some employees have raised questions internally about the integrity of health data coming from the company’s clinics that has been used to support product development, according to people familiar with their concerns and the documents.<br />An Apple spokesman said data integrity is the foundation for all of the company’s innovations. He pointed to the accomplishments of its health team and said the company is still in the early innings of its work in healthcare, adding that new technology such as heart-rate notifications in products like the Apple Watch have improved users’ health. He said data gathered by Apple’s devices is enabling new research that has the potential to improve care.</td>

The State Council, China’s cabinet, last month said it would take steps to ensure adequate supply and stable prices for commodities, and regulators had previously warned industry representatives to take a zero-tolerance approach to market manipulation or hoarding of metals.</td>

Brown, a former senior revenue manager at computer-networking company  Infinera Corp.  Mr. Brown allegedly tipped off a friend, Benjamin Wylam, about Infinera’s undisclosed quarterly results from April 2016 through November 2017, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said it uncovered the scheme and separately alleged the six defendants committed civil fraud.<br />The SEC said Mr. Wylam is a Santa Clara, Calif., high-school teacher who worked as a bookmaker on the side. He communicated about stocks with Mr. Brown using WhatsApp, an encrypted text-messaging application, the SEC said. Mr. Wylam made over $1 million in illicit profit, according to the SEC’s lawsuit, which said he wrote on an internet message board that “insider trading is part of my investment strategy.”<br />Mr. Wylam has agreed to plead guilty to criminal securities fraud, according to court records. He also agreed to resolve the SEC’s civil allegations and pay a fine that a court will set later. Mr. Brown is litigating with the SEC, the agency said, without providing more information.<br />The tipping chain involved other individuals, authorities said. Mr. Wylam passed his illicit scoops about Infinera to Naveen Sood, who owed him a gambling debt of more than $100,000, according to the SEC. Mr. Sood then shared the information with three other friends—Naresh Ramaiya, Marcus Bannon and Matthew Rauch—who also traded on the material nonpublic information, according to the SEC.</td>

The measure still has to pass the House.<br />Also known as Emancipation Day, Black Independence Day or Jubilee Day, Juneteenth marks June 19, 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived with federal troops in Galveston, Texas, and issued an order informing the last enslaved people in Texas that they were free. This came more than two months after the end of the Civil War and two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation freeing slaves in the Southern states.<br />It wasn’t until the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in December 1865 that slavery was abolished throughout the entire country.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) hadn’t publicly announced any plans to bring the Juneteenth bill up for a vote, so it came as a surprise Tuesday afternoon when he sought to fast-track its passage by seeking unanimous consent from all 100 senators.</td>

It passed 157-1, mainly with support from the Fidesz, the conservative-nationalist party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.<br />Yet the vote also won backing from members of the right-wing Jobbik party, showing the difficulty Hungary’s opposition faces in ousting Mr. Orban in elections next year. United Opposition, a fractious coalition spanning from left-wing to far-right parties, including Jobbik, currently leads in most polls. But Tuesday’s vote shows how Mr. Orban can still count on deep ideological divides between his liberal and socially conservative challengers.<br />Mr. Orban’s spokesman Zoltan Kovacs didn’t return requests for comments.<br />The prime minister’s party mainly promoted the law by pointing to its restrictions against pedophilia, without elaborating on the specific measures the law imposes on media content depicting individuals who are gay or who no longer identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. Csaba Domotor, the Fidesz state secretary, told the AP the goal was “the protection of children,” saying that the law includes a new, searchable registry of convicted pedophiles.</td>

      <td>President Biden is telling the world in Europe this week that “America is back” as the leader of global democracies. Sounds good. But China, Iran and Vladimir Putin would be more impressed if Mr. Biden wasn’t cutting America’s defense even as he rightly stresses the challenge from the world’s authoritarians.<br />Unremarked in the White House spending deluge is that its trillions for “infrastructure” include little new for defense. Mr. Biden’s $715 billion Pentagon budget for fiscal 2022 is a 1.6% increase over last year. Adjusted for inflation, this is a cut. The bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission and other experts say the Pentagon needs steady 3% to 5% real increases annually to address threats from “near peers” such as China and Russia.<br />President Trump increased defense spending modestly, but that fillip has passed and spending is still at its modern norm of about 3% of GDP. America is rapidly piling up debt past 100% of GDP while shrinking its defenses.<br />The brightest budget spots are places where the Administration declined to make matters worse: The Administration didn’t slash the Army; active-duty end strength holds at about 485,000. But the service requested about $3.5 billion less than last year’s enacted budget, in part due to a drawdown in Afghanistan.<br />The Biden Team also overruled progressive critics and asked to fund upgrades to an aging nuclear deterrent. The anachronism known as the “overseas contingency operations” fund will be folded in the normal budget, a more honest accounting.</td>

      <td>Climate alarmists continue to have a big problem: democracy. Every time voters are presented with something close to the actual costs of achieving draconian CO2 emissions targets, they say no.<br />The latest reality check came Sunday in Switzerland, where 51.6% of the voters rejected a government scheme to meet the anti-carbon goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. That’s the agreement that President Biden recently rejoined, albeit without the approval of American voters or Congress.<br />At least the Swiss were honest enough to tell voters that they would have to pay for their climate indulgences with the likes of a surcharge on car fuel costs and a tax on airline tickets. Perhaps most Swiss thought this cost was exorbitant, or useless, since the country contributes only 0.1% to global CO2 emissions. The Swiss could go net-zero on CO2 and it wouldn’t matter a whit to the climate.<br />This explains why America’s climate left assiduously avoids putting carbon taxes on the ballot. Mr. Biden won’t even endorse indexing the federal gas tax for inflation. Instead the Administration is planning to use regulatory and judicial coercion. Voters understand they will pay for the climate obsessions of elites.</td>

      <td>President Biden has racked up one major victory on his European trip. He and European Union leaders on Tuesday agreed to suspend for five years one of the world’s longest-running and most confusing trade disputes—concerning  Boeing  and  Airbus .<br />Like the fictional Jarndyce and Jarndyce in Dickens’s “Bleak House,” this dispute has been grinding along for so long that hardly anyone remembers what it is about. In 2004 during the George W. Bush Administration—remember that?—Washington alleged that EU countries had granted Airbus some $22 billion in illegal subsidies. The EU counterclaimed that Washington had extended Boeing some $23 billion in illegal subsidies.<br />They all trotted off to adjudication at the World Trade Organization, and have been fitfully lobbing retaliatory tariffs at each other as the trade dispute evolved. President Trump escalated the dispute, of course, with $7.5 billion in tariffs on European goods following a WTO ruling in Boeing’s favor. The EU responded with tariffs of $4 billion on U.S. goods.<br />One of Mr. Biden’s smarter moves has been to call time on this. He and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen this spring announced a four-month pause on tariffs related to the dispute. Tuesday’s agreement extends the truce to five years, which one can hope will be long enough for all concerned to forget about it. The rest of the U.S. and European economies can go back to trading without fear of becoming collateral damage.<br />This will free both sides to focus on trade disputes that matter more to the future. Those include Europe’s excessive food-safety standards that inhibit U.S. agricultural exports and overreaching data-privacy regulations that threaten to impinge on the trans-Atlantic digital economy. Brussels can prod Washington over America’s agricultural protectionism, the Trump steel tariffs that linger as the aviation dispute lifts, and “Buy America” provisions that Mr. Biden and Democrats shove into their spending bills.</td>

But bipartisanship for its own sake, or to assist progressives in their attempt to remake America, is destructive. Senate Republicans moving toward an infrastructure compromise have to calculate which kind of deal they’re embracing.<br />A group of 10 Senators—five Democrats and five Republicans—last week announced they’ve agreed on the “framework” for such a deal. Details are scant, but leaks suggest the proposal would cost $1.2 trillion over eight years and include $579 billion in new spending. The deal is geared toward core infrastructure such as roads, bridges and broadband, though it would also include some of President Biden’s green-energy demands.<br />The Senators said in a statement that the deal would be “fully paid for and not include tax increases.” They are still haggling over “pay-fors”—with ideas that include indexing the gasoline tax to inflation, imposing electric-vehicle user fees, or creating a new federal infrastructure bank.<br />The country could use some infrastructure investment, and a focused bill that repurposes unspent Covid funds is the best option. The problem is what comes next. Republicans are uneasy about the size of the package. But they might be convinced to go along if they knew this compromise was the end of the Democratic spending plans. The White House would get its big infrastructure win, and Republicans would stop more left-wing damage.<br />But Mr. Biden has proposed trillions of dollars in additional spending, and progressives are already vowing to stuff anything that doesn’t make the infrastructure cut into a separate bill that could pass with only 50 Senate votes (plus the Vice President’s tie-breaker). Politico reports that Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders isn’t “sweating” the bipartisan talks, because he’s already rallying support for his follow-on bonanza.</td>

Too often, however, companies’ embrace of Pride Month comes off as virtue signaling to attract queer customers rather than a genuine celebration and pledge of action.<br />Take  Disney .  “There’s room for everyone under the rainbow,” it tweeted on June 1. “Happy #PrideMonth!” Meanwhile, on the same day, the company was hit with a sexual-orientation discrimination lawsuit by one of its executives, Joel Hopkins. Alex Hirsch, the creator of Disney’s hit show “Gravity Falls,” also criticized the company for the hypocrisy of its tweet. Calling on his own experience at Disney, Mr. Hirsch suggested scenes with queer representation are cut because Disney doesn’t want to upset its Russian and Chinese sponsors. He alluded to how creatives would be told by Disney executives to “please revise” their queer characters because they weren’t “Disney appropriate.”</td>

      <td>El Salvador puts the digital money on par with the U.S. dollar for all public and private debts.</td>
      <td>Central banks around the world have been scrambling to co-opt digital currencies for their own purposes. El Salvador beat them all to the punch by passing a law that makes bitcoin legal tender for all debts public and private.<br />Through this law, El Salvador’s legislators essentially voted to begin the process of outsourcing the country’s monetary policy to a decentralized network of computers governed by a fixed set of rules. This is an important step toward a world where money is sound, not subject to the vagaries of politics.<br />Most proposed central-bank digital currencies would be tightly controlled by governments. These currencies would reinforce the status quo, not revolutionize monetary systems. That’s because the overwhelming majority of money in existence issued and controlled by central banks is already digital—only a small share of global money supply exists as paper money and coins. When most people talk about a digital coin issued by the Federal Reserve, they do not have in mind a rules-based, censorship-resistant money like bitcoin, but rather a mechanism for the Fed to control the money supply directly without private banks serving as intermediaries.<br />One huge concern about granting the Fed this much power is the distinct possibility of weaponizing the money supply. Certain parts of the country could be targeted with lower interest rates to spur economic growth selectively, creating opportunities for partisan conflict.<br />El Salvador, which doesn’t have its own currency, is avoiding this risk by making bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The law provides that any economic actor technologically able to accept bitcoin is required to do so for payments of goods and services. It also permits bitcoin to be used to pay taxes and exempts bitcoin transactions themselves from capital-gains taxation.</td>
