      <td>The genre, which takes familiar sounds from electronic pop, rap and dance and intensifies them through compression, distortion and exaggeration, broke into the mainstream this year thanks to figures like 100 Gecs and A.G. Cook.</td>
      <td><br /><br />On Dec. 4, electro-pop outfit 100 Gecs released a new holiday-themed song, “Sympathy 4 the Grinch.” The track by the duo Dylan Brady and Laura Les is an impossibly fast and frenetic number that welds the pogoing bounce of ska with the explosive choruses of pop-punk while adding a thick coating of distorted electronics to chirpy, pitched-up vocals. Like many songs by 100 Gecs, it’s polarizing, beloved by fans for its infectious energy but seemingly designed to clear the room of anyone who doesn’t connect to their aesthetic. For those in the latter camp, it’s as annoying as music gets. The genre? It’s usually called hyperpop, and 100 Gecs, along with London producer A.G. Cook, are among its most visible proponents.<br />Hyperpop artists take familiar sounds from electronic pop, rap and dance and intensify them through compression, exaggerating the elements that scanned as “artificial”—programmed drums, Auto-Tuned vocals, the blaring synths found in videogames—to create a cartoonish wall of noise that embraces catchy tunes and memorable hooks. The music zooms between beauty and ugliness, as shimmery melodies collide with mangled instrumentation. The genre tag was originally applied in 2014 to Mr. Cook’s London-based collective and label PC Music, but now reaches much further: In August 2019, streaming platform Spotify, responding to the growing popularity of 100 Gecs, created the hyperpop playlist to highlight this scene. Many of the tracks found in the site’s survey, which currently has almost 150,000 subscribers, are created by teenagers, some as young as 15. It’s a style utterly of this moment that is also difficult to pin down, since it is continuously mutating.<br />Mr. Cook and 100 Gecs had a big year in 2020—as did hyperpop as a whole. The latter released a remix album, “1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues,” and its two members, individually and collectively, produced music for more than a dozen songs by others, including British singer Charli XCX and bawdy Maryland rapper Rico Nasty. A.G. Cook, who is Charli XCX’s creative director, co-produced and co-wrote her excellent album “How I’m Feeling Now,” released in May; co-wrote and co-produced “Shiver” by Jónsi, frontman of Icelandic dream-rock band Sigur Rós; and issued two albums under his own name, the 49-track “7G” and the concise “Apple.” These are the most visible products of the genre’s current wave, but the scene around the sound goes much deeper and is fueled by the digital culture created by teenagers.</td>

      <td>Majority leader says lawmakers will begin process to examine larger payouts, Section 230 online rules, vote fraud concerns</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked an effort by Democrats to hold a vote on sending bigger stimulus checks to many Americans, amid growing calls within the GOP for the larger coronavirus-relief payments sought by President Trump.<br />The Kentucky Republican, without committing to hold a vote, said the Senate would address Mr. Trump’s demands to boost the size of the checks to $2,000 from $600 as well as his concerns about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which regulates online speech, and his complaints about purported election fraud. Mr. Trump has blamed fraud for his defeat in the November election, but no significant fraud has emerged.<br />“This week the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus,” Mr. McConnell said, without offering further details. A person familiar with his thinking said Mr. McConnell was considering putting all three items into one bill.<br />The comments came after several Republican senators, including two competing in runoffs soon that will decide control of the Senate, said they would support larger checks.<br />Mr. Trump signed a Covid-19 aid bill into law Sunday but said that the $600 payments in that package were too small. The House then moved to vote to increase the size of the checks to $2,000, which passed Monday night 275 to 134, with 44 Republicans joining almost all Democrats in support.</td>

      <td>A scientific advisory committee had advised lower limits on sugar and alcohol, citing health risks</td>
      <td>The federal government on Tuesday issued new dietary guidelines that keep current allowances for sugar and alcohol consumption unchanged, rejecting recommendations by its scientific advisory committee to make significant cuts.<br />The scientific committee, which was composed of 20 academics and doctors, had recommended cutting the limit for added sugars in the diet to 6% of daily calories from 10% in the current guidelines, citing rising rates of obesity and the link between obesity and health problems like Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The committee also recommended lowering the limit for alcoholic beverages for men to one drink per day from two, matching the guidance for women. It pointed to research linking greater alcohol consumption to a higher risk of death.<br />The new guidelines do include the scientific committee’s recommendation that children under age 2 consume no added sugars at all. This is the first time the guidelines have included recommendations for babies and toddlers. Added sugars are those found in processed foods—in everything from soda to breakfast cereal—as well as honey and sugar itself. They don’t include sugars naturally found in foods like fruit and milk.<br />The dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years, have a wide impact: They shape school lunch programs, mold state and local health-promotion efforts, and influence what food companies produce.<br />The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services reviewed the committee’s recommendations, which were released in July, and decided not to include the lower limits because “the new evidence is not substantial enough to support changes to quantitative recommendations for either added sugars or alcohol,” said Brandon Lipps, deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the USDA. Mr. Lipps said that the new limits recommended by the scientific committee didn’t meet a “preponderance of the evidence” standard required by law.</td>

      <td>Capitalism errs in thinking that putting sin to good use will transform it into virtue.</td>
      <td>Phil Gramm and Mike Solon’s “In Defense of Scrooge, Whose Thrift Blessed the World” (op-ed, Dec. 24) is a witty and intelligent defense of capitalism with a moral error. The genius of capitalism is that it harnesses human greed to the common good—but greed itself remains a sin. We are reminded of this every time a company uses foreign slave labor to bring down prices or calculates that the lawsuits arising from a safety glitch will cost it less than fixing the danger before anyone gets hurt. It may be good business, but it’s bad living.<br />Capitalism is a boon to humanity, but Marley was right: Mankind remains our business as well, and fairness, honesty and generosity should govern the heart even in the pursuit of profits.<br />It’s a fallen world. No system will fix it. Socialism errs in thinking it can force sinful humans to be what they are not. Capitalism errs in thinking that putting sin to good use will transform it into virtue.

      <td>Chunky clogs have become improbably trendy, with brands like Chanel, Hermès and Louis Vuitton offering high-fashion takes. Here, the footwear’s surprising history, from Dutch workers’ shoes to the Paris runways.</td>
      <td>ON HER FIRST date with Joe Biden, in 1975, Jill Biden, then a college student at the University of Delaware, immediately noticed his shoes. As she later recounted, “I had been dating guys in jeans and clogs and T-shirts, he came to the door and he had a sport coat and loafers and I thought, ‘God, this is never going to work, not in a million years.’”<br />As the incoming first lady observed, the divide between the clogged and the unclogged can seem vast. On the one side, bohemian aplomb; on the other, an uptight suspicion of any shoe that shares an etymology with plumbing mishaps. But reader, she married him. Is the gap really as yawning as we assume it to be?<br />It’s certainly narrowing, especially now that both mass-market and luxury brands are bringing new designs to eager consumers. In September,  Crocs  released a collaboration with the Puerto Rican rap star Bad Bunny that sold out in 16 minutes. And this season, Hermès, which is better known for handbags with yearslong waiting lists, is releasing its anticipated iteration; priced at $990, it’s in the new category of luxury clog. The Hermès design comes on the heels of  Louis Vuitton ,  Gucci, Dior and Chanel versions, not to mention more affordable offerings from Everlane and Gap, all of which are late to the party compared with No. 6, the New York brand whose earthy pairs made wood-soled shoes a fashionable class signifier 15 years ago.<br />This clog blossoming suggests not just a high-fashion takeover of a shoe formerly associated with artisans and hippies, but its newly broad appeal.<br />As with everything this year, the growing visibility of clogs has been shaped by the pandemic. With less of a reason to wear formal shoes, either because of unemployment or closed offices, clogs’ slip-on, slip-off ease is understandably appealing. And perhaps because their comfort and support makes them a favorite of health care workers, 2020’s superheroes, they’ve taken on an associative feel-good glow.</td>

In arguing for an end to lockdowns once vulnerable populations have been vaccinated, their analysis assumes that there is a binary outcome from Covid-19 infections: Either it kills you or it’s no threat at all.<br />Follow-up studies, however, have demonstrated that long-term cognitive and behavioral problems are common, affecting up to 20% of hospitalized survivors and up to 10% of patients with a much milder disease. There are a significant number of Covid patients who are left with chronic respiratory problems, chronic anosmia and cardiac sequela, and these problems aren’t limited to the elderly. The rest of the population is also at risk and must be protected, even if immediate death isn’t likely.<br />Most Americans would love to see the end of our public-health measures, but this is far too soon. What we can do is return children under 16 to school. We have sound data showing that, given appropriate precautionary measures, we can make school safe for students and their teachers.<br />Prof. Lawrence F.

The late researcher of the complex genetic and environmental factors relating to intelligence believed, as Mr. Riley puts it, that “dodging difficult topics was intellectual cowardice.” That brings to mind cancel culture, the apotheosis of intellectual cowardice. Does the need to shut down discussion, out of fear or plain rage, have its roots in genetic or environmental factors? We should study that, too.<br />Tom O’Hare<br />Charlestown, R.I.<br /><br />Mr. Riley quotes Flynn’s remark: “To advise scholars that they should not systemically investigate race and IQ seems to me to raise the question of what we are afraid of.” The Trump era has provided a bit of clarity on how one might begin to answer that. We aren’t afraid of the evidence or the truth about racial differences. We are afraid of individuals who wield great power and demonstrate little appreciation of the finer points. Do we need to go public with findings that we know will be used to substantiate distorted conclusions?</td>

People of color account for one-third of the bank’s board, 17% of its management committee and 40% of new hires.<br />Eastern’s drive is decades in the making.

But in June, a federal judge in the District of Columbia ruled that the new rules were legal.<br />The hospital trade group appealed, arguing that the rule compelling the hospitals to publish their negotiated rates with insurers violated the First Amendment and went beyond the statutory intent of the Affordable Care Act.<br />On Tuesday, a panel for the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia unanimously upheld the district court’s ruling.<br />The decision not only “fits comfortably within existing First Amendment precedent,” but also is “not intended to expand existing First Amendment doctrine or to otherwise affect traditional or ordinary economic regulation of commercial activity,” they wrote.</td>

      <td>Natural-gas prices are heading for their second consecutive big monthly drop, stung by warmer-than-expected weather forecasts that are denting demand for the heating fuel.<br />Even though it posted an outsize rebound on Tuesday, the front-month natural-gas futures contract has fallen 14.4% this month. That would mark its second straight monthly decline bigger than 14% and largest monthly drop since January. Prices are more than 25% below a peak hit in late October and have suffered four daily drops of at least 6% this month, a period of outsize volatility punctuated by Monday’s 8.5% slide and Tuesday’s recovery.<br />Natural-gas prices often gyrate in the winter because demand in the season is driven by how frequently people use their heaters. The power-generation fuel is used as the primary source of heat for roughly half of the homes in the U.S., so speculative investors often position for demand and prices to rally in the colder months of the year.<br />Recent weather forecasts show warmer temperatures spreading across the U.S. in the next few weeks, though, driving an unwind of bullish bets and fresh price declines.<br />“It is becoming increasingly apparent that the market will need to gradually discount another warmer-than-normal winter,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.</td>

      <td>As this difficult year slinks to its unlamented end, I have felt compelled to ask myself: What do I believe so much that if necessary I will fight for it the way America’s revolutionaries did, with their lives, fortunes and sacred honor? And how do my beliefs compare with the widening spectrum of beliefs about America?<br />Many populist conservatives believe that America was at its best in the 1950s, when men were men and women were women, manufacturing dominated the economy, white Christians dominated the culture, patriotism was unquestioned, and divisive social issues hadn’t entered the public agenda.<br />I believe in America the way liberals do—not as perfect, but capable of being made “more perfect.” I believe in America the way Abraham Lincoln did at Gettysburg when he promised a new birth of freedom built on the foundation of the Declaration of Independence. I believe in America the way Martin Luther King Jr. did when he rooted his dream in the American dream and denominated the unpaid promissory note to black Americans in the principles of the declaration. I believe in America the way that Bill Clinton did when he declared in his 1993 inaugural address, “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.”<br />There are those who don’t believe that America ever was, or ever can be, worthy of devotion. On the far left, some argue that America is irredeemably marked by slavery, conquest and genocide. They are right that we should seek to understand and to teach history fully, without glossing over its brutalities. But it is one thing to be honest about the past, another to use it as proof of a national original sin that can never be expunged. At the end of this road is despair—or revolution.<br />On the far right there are those who give America’s original sin a different name—liberalism. They claim that the Declaration of Independence inspired by John Locke has led us down the primrose path. A polity based on individual rights liberates appetites and destroys morality, they say, and the civil law created to protect liberty becomes the source of its destruction. At the end of this road lies theocracy, which could only be achieved at the point of the sword, or withdrawal into faith communities whose existence is protected by the polity their members scorn.</td>

      <td>Prices won’t break out of the $40 to $50 range until consumption gets back to normal sometime next year.</td>
      <td>When will oil sustainably break out of the “Virus Alley”—that $40 to $50 band that has held oil prices in check for months? That’s Question No. 1 going into 2021 for an oil industry that has dramatically retrenched and investors who have abandoned the sector because of a lack of returns. It will also determine when U.S. shale recovers from its pandemic malaise and resumes growth.<br />Only a year ago prospects looked pretty good. Optimism about the world economy at the beginning of 2020 had a barrel of Brent crude at $70. Then came a pandemic that was in almost no company’s—or country’s—emergency plans. The general view of something called SARS-CoV-2 was initially conditioned by the experience of SARS-1 in the early 2000s, which had about 8,000 cases world-wide and fewer than 800 deaths.<br />But by March the highly transmissible coronavirus was precipitating a world-wide shutdown, the worst global recession in 74 years, and the constriction of movement by both car and plane. That led to a plummeting of global oil demand and a price collapse that saw prices go “negative,” or below zero, as producers paid people to take their oil away because storage tanks were filled to overflowing.<br />The rebound from negative prices and the stabilization of the market was made possible by unprecedented production cuts by the group that calls itself OPEC-plus—the 13 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and a group of 10 other producing nations led by Russia. That U.S.-brokered agreement got oil prices up into the $40 to $50 range of Virus Alley, blocked at one end by the virus and at the other by the uncertain prospect for vaccines. Now that vaccines are here, prices have moved to the $50 end of the alley. But will they rise into that higher band of $50 to $65 that will enable companies to start spending and attract investors?<br />In the short term, such a rebound will be challenged. The resurgence of the virus is again leading to shutdowns, reducing economic activities. A clear indication of this was provided by the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., when  IHS Markit ’s  weekly survey showed that gasoline demand had fallen to a level last seen in 1997. But on the expectation of widespread vaccinations by the spring, IHS Markit estimates that global economic growth in 2021 will reach 4.5%. While this will cancel out the 4% decline of 2020, small business and other sectors will be left devastated.</td>

In that spirit, we look forward to engaging with Third Point LLC on their ideas towards that goal.”<br />Intel, which both designs and builds its own chips, said this year that it would consider outsourcing the manufacturing of some of its most advanced chips. The company is expected to decide soon where it will make future generations of processors.<br />Third Point said Intel risks triggering broader implications for U.S. tech supremacy if it fails to act. “Without immediate change at Intel, we fear that America’s access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia to power everything from PCs to data centers to critical infrastructure and more,” the letter says.</td>

      <td>A New Jersey man is suing local authorities who he says wrongly arrested him based on a false facial-recognition match, in a case that risks further inflaming debate over the utility and accuracy of the fast-emerging technology.<br />The man, 33-year-old Nijeer Parks, spent more than a week in jail after police detained him in February 2019 on charges of shoplifting, assault and drug possession related to a Jan. 26 incident that year at a Hampton Inn hotel in Woodbridge, N.J., according to a complaint filed in New Jersey Superior Court.<br />The criminal case was dismissed in November 2019, according to a court official in Middlesex County, where Woodbridge is located. Mr. Parks is now seeking unspecified damages, according to the complaint, over allegations including false arrest, civil-rights violations and emotional distress.<br />The New Jersey state police, Woodbridge police and prosecutors in Middlesex County didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. New York state police officials, whom the Woodbridge police sent photographs for facial-recognition comparison, said their records showed they didn’t provide any leads in the case.<br />Police increasingly have adopted facial-recognition software into their crime-solving arsenal. Advocates say it is an effective new technology that has helped solve many cases, but the tools have drawn growing scrutiny in law enforcement in part because of the potential consequences of a false match.</td>

Lawmakers are calling for further investigation. The companies say it was above board.<br />The Wall Street Journal viewed part of a recent unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which elaborates on allegations in the redacted complaint filed in a Texas federal district court.<br />Ten Republican attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say Google gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a ubiquitous tool for allocating advertising space across the web. This and other conduct by Google, they allege in the final lawsuit, harms competition and deprives “advertisers, publishers and consumers of improved quality, greater transparency, increased output and/or lower prices.”<br />Previously unreported details from the draft, including contract terms and company documents, shed light on the legal battle ahead and the relationship between two tech giants who have called each other competitors even as they hold an ever-widening share of the digital advertising market.<br />A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on specific terms of the deal. She said the states’ “complaint misrepresents this agreement, as it does many other aspects of our ad tech business. We look forward to making our case in court.”</td>

An American spokeswoman said the airline has begun announcing aircraft types during boarding to make sure passengers are aware when they are flying on a MAX. American will also alert passengers if they are suddenly scheduled to fly on a MAX due to a schedule change, she said.<br />David Seymour, American’s chief operating officer, said gradually reintroducing the MAX would help build customer confidence and give passengers flexibility if they initially prefer to fly on other aircraft. He said in an interview earlier this month that American pilots and flight attendants are confident of the plane’s safety.<br />“We would have never brought the aircraft back if they were not comfortable,” he said.</td>

      <td>Vermont is a tough place to visit this winter, but if you don’t want to socialize, here’s where to quarantine cozily</td>
      <td>HIDING OUT in Vermont’s snowy Green Mountains presents some challenges during Covid-times—but that’s the allure. The state’s strict regulations, wide-open spaces and intelligent epidemic management have led to one of the country’s lowest rates of infection. A tough place to visit, Vermont requires all out-of-state travelers to quarantine for seven days if they have a negative Covid test or 14 days without one—either before they leave home or after arrival. The state also limits locals and visitors alike from gathering with people from other households. Lodgings and restaurants and even ski resorts, however, are open at limited capacity.<br />The obstacles have kept most visitors at home, but if you don’t mind quarantining and don’t want to socialize, Vermont can be your own private snow globe this winter. And if you’re a skier, 50% lower capacity on peak weekends on the mountains means 50% fewer people scraping off the powder. We recommend these three, extra-safe lodging strategies, all focused on southern Vermont counties with even lower Covid rates than the rest of the state. Strap on your snowshoes.<br />The owners of the Homestyle Hotel Inn + Restaurant in Ludlow recently took over a motel in an 1830s building across the street and turned it into the Main + Mountain Bar and Motel. The transformed hostelry’s second-floor accommodations feature cool hues of white and gray, with live-edge headboards and white subway tile.<br />Covid-safety bonus: The motel has contactless check-in and pickup from the bar downstairs, and every room’s doors and windows open to the outside. Best of all, this fall the owners closed the hotel part of their property across the street and turned its former guest rooms into private dining rooms for the Homestyle Restaurant.<br />Surroundings: The homey mill town of Ludlow has emerged as one of Southern Vermont’s best dining destinations, and is about a five-minute drive from the access road to Okemo Mountain.</td>

That could open a door for big state banks or other types of government-controlled entities to buy into the firm to help beef up its capital base, the officials and advisers say.<br />China’s national pension fund, China Development Bank and  China International Capital Corp. , the country’s top state-owned investment bank, are already investors in Ant.<br />Mr. Ma, China’s richest person, has helped define China’s new economy with the two companies he founded—Ant and its e-commerce affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Their businesses span payment services, online retail, cloud computing, wealth management and lending. Separately, Alibaba is facing an antitrust probe that could also lead to an overhaul of its business and asset divestitures.</td>

      <td>From free tests to the shielding of care homes, Tübingen has pioneered tools later deployed elsewhere to minimize pandemic casualties</td>
      <td>Concern is growing in Europe over access to vaccine doses during the winter wave of Covid-19. But one town claims to have found a formula to prevent high mortality without a draconian lockdown.<br />The southern German city of Tübingen was hit hard by the virus in the spring, but measures such as widely available testing and even subsidizing taxi rides have since managed to protect the elderly, who make up most of the fatalities.<br />At the peak of the first wave in April, the town had 70 Covid-19 patients in its biggest hospital—out of 89,000 inhabitants—including 33 in intensive care, forcing doctors to cancel elective surgery. Now, at the height of the far more devastating current surge, patients number just 35, many transferred from other regions. Fifteen of them are in intensive care, of whom fewer than half are Tübingen residents. The hospital hasn’t canceled non-urgent surgery.<br />Local authorities say such numbers are no accident. The town, they point out, started earlier than most German municipalities in carrying out frequent Covid-19 tests on care-home staff, residents and visitors. It subsidizes taxi rides for those over age 65 so they don’t have to use public transit. Younger residents are discouraged from shopping between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. so as to avoid seniors having to mingle with people who are more likely to carry the virus without symptoms.<br />Tübingen’s pandemic policy has so far cost it half a million euros, all financed through the town‘s budget. A week of the current lockdown, with restaurants and all nonessential stores closed, costs the German economy and the state between €27 billion and €57 billion in lost output and subsidies, according to estimates by the Ifo Institute, a government-funded economics think tank in Munich.</td>

Over the past two weeks, authorities in Dalian have tallied up 35 symptomatic carriers, including the two reported Tuesday. Hundreds of flights into and out of Shenyang and Dalian have been suspended in recent days to prevent the further spread of the disease.</td>

While convenient for some and for others the only way to see the movie, the creators of the production describe streaming as a regrettable medium for superhero films.<br />Star Gal Gadot, who plays the main character in “Wonder Woman 1984,” said in an interview the streaming experience for viewers is unlikely to match going to the movie theater. “Cinemas have the ability to give fans the 360 experience,” she said.<br />Director Patty Jenkins even shot the film with special IMAX cameras hoping to amplify the scale of the 2½ hour action-packed spectacle.<br />The producer of “Wonder Woman 1984,” Charles Roven, who has made a career out of producing big-budget franchise films, also said the big screen is key to superhero movies’ success with fans. But, in Hollywood, where the genre has dominated the business for more than a decade, their allure is also about profitability, he said. The longtime producer isn’t convinced WarnerMedia’s plan to debut his films, “Wonder Woman 1984” and next year’s “The Suicide Squad” in theaters and on streaming service HBO Max simultaneously, makes economic sense.<br />“If you’re making a movie that costs $200 million plus and you want it to be viable,” it needs a big theatrical debut, said Mr. Roven. “People want the spectacle so that’s why you spend the money. They come to see it. That generates the profits.”</td>

      <td>Trump’s veto of defense authorization bill becomes a focus in Senate runoffs</td>
      <td>President-elect Joe Biden’s narrow victory in Georgia last month was driven in part by shifts toward the Democratic ticket in a collection of nine counties with strong ties to the military.<br />As a group, the military counties backed President Trump. However, his victory margin was 7.8 percentage points less than in 2016, a greater movement than the 5.3-point swing toward Mr. Biden statewide. And while voter turnout grew by less than 21% across Georgia, the number of votes cast in military counties rose by nearly 26%.<br />Now, Mr. Trump’s veto of the annual defense policy bill is adding new complications to GOP voter turnout efforts ahead of Jan. 5 Georgia runoff elections that will determine control of the U.S. Senate. Mr. Trump said he rejected the bill due to provisions that would remove Confederate names of military bases, limit his ability to withdraw troops abroad and didn’t remove legal protections for internet platforms he says squelch conservative voices.<br />The $740.5 billion bill passed the House and Senate with bipartisan majorities, including support from Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the two Georgia Republicans defending their seats in the runoffs.<br />The two senators must now decide whether to support a president who could help boost Republican turnout in the runoffs or back a veto override of the bill. The legislation authorizes $168 million in military construction projects in Georgia, funds for educating military children and enhanced hazard pay and bonuses for certain military personnel, among other things.</td>

      <td>The use of Snapchat, Instagram or TikTok can fray or strengthen ties, depending on whether pals communicate the same way</td>
      <td>For many teenagers, the past year has been a blur of online classes, remote extracurriculars and virtual holiday celebrations. The shift to small-screen living might not seem like a major adjustment for teens already glued to their devices, but it has reshaped what is most critical to them: their friendships.<br />I interviewed five teenagers across the country to learn what nearly a year of living virtually has been like for them. A common theme is that their tech choices—or those of their parents and even their friends’ parents—dictate with whom they have stayed in touch. That was the case, to some extent, before the Covid-19 pandemic, but it has become starker in the months since many in-person interactions came to an abrupt end in March.<br />Nearly half of the 849 teens surveyed by Common Sense Media late last spring reported feeling less connected than usual with their friends after schools closed. Students who had once talked to certain friends every day in the school cafeteria or in the hallway suddenly lost touch with all but their closest pals once schools shut down, unless they happened to be connected on the same social-media apps. Some even lost touch with their best friends because of the technology they do or don’t use.<br />Here is how these teenagers say technology has dictated their friendships in the months since the pandemic altered their social interactions.<br />Ian Pase, a 16-year-old from Anaheim Hills, Calif., who has attended his public school remotely since the spring, prefers Snapchat to keep in touch with friends. “There are a lot of people who I’m not superclose friends with who I liked talking to in class but we don’t have each other’s social media so we can’t really communicate anymore,” he said. “I also have friends who don’t have Snapchat because their parents don’t allow them to have it. They use Instagram to text each other so there’s kind of a disconnect.”</td>

In January, Mr. Koizumi said the project couldn’t gain the understanding of the international community.</td>

      <td>U.S. doesn’t need to reach full herd immunity before public spaces can begin phased reopenings</td>
      <td>As 2021 arrives, there is one question that matters most: How soon can we escape the Covid-19 pandemic?<br />The answer is as elusive as it is pressing. It is unknown what level of natural infection and immunization is needed to reach herd immunity in the population. It is also unknown how many people in the U.S. have already contracted the coronavirus. Whatever the answer to the question, trillions of dollars in economic activity are at stake, as are millions of livelihoods.<br />By some metrics, things have never been worse: U.S. hospitalizations are at a record high, and public-health experts continue to warn that things will get worse before they get better. With more than 19 million confirmed cases in the U.S., achieving herd immunity is a ways off. After all, that figure accounts for just 6% of the U.S. population. And with daily new cases still reaching well into the hundreds of thousands, it seems unrealistic to hope for Covid-19 to vanish in the new year. Worse, public polling has suggested that some adults won’t take a vaccine if offered.<br />However, the outlook for the year ahead is much brighter than those grim figures would suggest. Eradicating Covid-19 shouldn’t be necessary to begin a gradual return to schools, restaurants, concert halls and arenas.<br />While the challenge of vaccinating a large portion of the country is significant, it might not be as daunting as it first seems. There are roughly 333 million people in the U.S., but not everyone will need a vaccine right away. For starters, about 19 million people have a confirmed case. The true number of cases is likely much higher: Many patients with confirmed cases do not show symptoms, and some people who experience symptoms consistent with Covid-19 choose not to seek medical attention. Children make up a large share of the U.S. population, and there is little evidence that schools are hot spots for spreading the virus. That suggests vaccinating children shouldn’t be a prerequisite for returning to normal. So far, the shots available in the U.S. are only authorized for patients 16 and older.</td>

      <td>Competing bids to Salesforce’s offer didn’t emerge, even after news of firms’ merger talks surfaced</td>
      <td>One of the largest tech deals this year also shows why there might be a lot fewer of them in the future.<br />Salesforce.com ’s  $27.7 billion acquisition of  Slack Technologies ,  announced this month, was the largest to date for the hyperacquisitive cloud-software provider, as well as the second-largest deal so far in the software space—behind IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat in 2018, according to Dealogic. The high price Salesforce paid—representing 26 times Slack’s projected revenue for the next 12 months—led many to speculate that the company faced competition on the deal.<br />But that wasn’t the case. According to a regulatory filing last week detailing the background of the merger, Slack Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield said he received “informal messages” from representatives of two large, publicly traded U.S. technology companies on Nov. 25—the day The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks between the two companies. But those reps only “expressed a desire to discuss the market rumors,” according to Mr. Butterfield. No actual competing bids emerged.<br />That isn’t a surprise. Besides the rather generous valuation Salesforce was already offering, the most likely competition would have come from tech giants that are already under intense government scrutiny.  Amazon.com  and Alphabet’s Google in particular operate large cloud businesses that could have benefited from the addition of Slack’s popular messaging platform. But Google is now the subject of several antitrust lawsuits from the federal government and most states, while Amazon is dealing with its own government probes into how it competes in the retail and cloud-services sectors.<br />Microsoft ,  while not under the same level of scrutiny, was also an unlikely bidder. The software giant has become Slack’s primary competitor with the popularity of its Teams platform, which has been reporting superior growth numbers to Slack of late. Having its own history with government crackdowns would also likely make Microsoft think twice before spending top dollar to take out a competitor. Other tech giants will be making similar calculations for the foreseeable future.</td>

Energy storage is a solution investors should watch in 2021, even if it doesn’t yet lend itself to stock picking.<br />Governments around the world greatly raised their decarbonization ambitions this year. There is great uncertainty about how their promises will be delivered, but almost all scenarios involve massive building of solar and wind farms. As their share of power production grows, it will become crucial to bridge the times when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine.<br />Building wind and solar together can reduce the gaps, while gas-fueled power plants can provide a nonrenewable backup. Also helpful are demand-side response agreements—when big power consumers promise to cut their usage during pinch points in exchange for lower prices.<br />Even with all these methods, though, it will be necessary to store excess electricity for use in lean times.</td>

      <td>A handful of startups and larger firms are experimenting with nationally competitive, nonlocalized pay. Is the extra cost worth the added employee goodwill?</td>
      <td>Tech workers and employers alike are beginning to question location-focused pay scales. A handful of companies are moving to abandon them altogether.<br />In setting pay without regard for location, tech companies including Reddit Inc. and  Zillow Group Inc.  are making a potentially expensive gamble to retain talent and gain a hiring edge. The move can entail maintaining relatively high salaries of employees who are relocating, and adopting a revised scale for new hires. Though it is early, the move challenges a long-held, but not universal, notion that where people live should determine what they make.<br />Some big tech firms including  Facebook Inc.  were clear early on in the pandemic that people moving away from the Bay Area to less expensive cities would see a pay cut. Payment platform Stripe Inc. offered one-time bonuses for workers who moved out of San Francisco, Seattle or New York—and agreed to a pay cut of up to 10%.<br />But a pay cut for any reason can be bad for worker morale, said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination. “Employers really have to do a bit of a dance to justify it to workers,” he said.<br />Workers considering more flexible work scenarios are themselves divided. A November survey of 600 tech workers by the job-search platform Indeed found that 60% of respondents would be willing to take a pay cut to work remotely permanently while 40% said they wouldn’t.</td>

      <td>A burst of central bank bond-buying has revived a debate about quantitative easing’s potential fiscal cost</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and  Bank of Japan  have collectively expanded their balance sheets by around $8 trillion in 2020. It took them almost eight years to achieve the same growth following the seizure of global financial markets in September 2008.<br />That burst of bond-buying has revived a debate about quantitative easing, and how it might impose a fiscal cost on the countries pursuing it. But the circumstances in which to worry look fairly limited.<br />The logic goes like this: When the central bank buys bonds from commercial banks, the proceeds are credited to those banks in the form of additional reserves parked at the monetary authority. The central bank then pays interest on those reserves. In periods like the past decade when the market value of bond portfolios has swelled, that has been profitable for central banks.<br />But if interest rates were to rise, all that might reverse: The central bank would be paying higher interest on its reserves—very short-term liabilities—and the value of its long-maturity bondholdings would decline. That might leave the central bank requiring assistance from the fiscal authority to be recapitalized, or at the very least cut short the profit central banks return to their finance ministries.<br />The important factor is the circumstances in which major developed economies might face an unexpected rise in inflation. There is a great deal we still don’t really know about inflationary pressure. But if it came from an economy genuinely running hot, it is very likely that tax revenues would be rising anyway, more than offsetting any expense rising from central bank losses.</td>

      <td>Widespread return isn’t likely until late spring or early summer of 2021</td>
      <td>Office-building landlords are hoping that the massive Covid-19 vaccination campaign launched in the U.S. this month will lead to millions of people returning to workplaces in 2021 after spending most of the pandemic working from home.<br />But it isn’t going to be soon. Rather, a widespread return probably won’t take place until the late spring or early summer of 2021 when enough people have been vaccinated in the U.S. for the population to come close to achieving “herd immunity,” according to public-health professionals and executives in the real-estate industry.<br />Moreover, the office world that will be reinhabited next year will look a lot different from the one that was hurriedly vacated in mid-March when the fear of Covid-19 sent much of the U.S. labor force into lockdown. During an initial transition period, office density likely will be low, workers will wear masks and a range of other safety precautions will be followed.<br />Long-term changes in the workplace will continue for years. Working from home and other remote locations, which became a necessity during the pandemic, will likely remain a major part of the workplace, employers and real-estate executives say.<br />Businesses that are highly competitive for top talent will likely begin opening small satellite offices in metropolitan areas and offering employees the option of working there, at home or in centralized headquarters—or a combination of the three. Design firm Gensler already is working with a half dozen Fortune 100 companies on such “hub-and-spoke” strategies, as they are becoming known in the office industry, said Joseph Brancato, co-chairman of the firm.</td>

Professional investors such as Stanley Druckenmiller and companies like Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. began investing this year. Companies like Robinhood Markets Inc. and  PayPal Holdings Inc.  allowed their customers to buy and sell bitcoin.<br />Despite those inroads, industry watchers say bitcoin must gain traction as a form of payment to become more ubiquitous. Spending it isn’t easy. Few merchants accept it, and many people are still unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency. Its use is generally limited to high-end purchases, like those at Mr. Dossa’s dealership.<br />Bitcoin, introduced in 2008, was designed to operate as a form of electronic cash, allowing users to exchange value as quickly and cheaply as sending an email. In practice, its adoption was hampered by several factors. In early years, it was difficult for average users to operate the digital wallets that stored their holdings. Many of the companies that tried accepting bitcoin in 2014 and 2015, including  Expedia Group Inc.  and Dell Inc., later quietly dropped it.</td>

But with a single announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration is formally pivoting from approving case-by-case exemptions to setting broad safety standards the industry has long sought.<br />The new approach, replacing stringent protections that currently bar practically all home-delivery options, go into effect in two months, but some requirements are likely to take years to implement.<br />The detailed regulations, which total more than 700 pages and parts of which had been in the works since the Obama administration, also aim to address concerns related to law enforcement, national security and privacy protection.<br />“They get us closer to the day when we will more routinely see drone operations such as the delivery of packages,” FAA chief Steve Dickson said in a written statement accompanying the rules. Mr. Dickson has told colleagues he intends to stay on under the Biden administration, according to people involved in the conversations, to fill out the remainder of his five-year term ending in 2024.

Pricing can change based on investor feedback until the day before a company’s stock starts trading.<br />SAP CEO Christian Klein in July said the company would take Qualtrics public while remaining the majority shareholder. The deal, he said, would allow Qualtrics to better pursue non-SAP business opportunities.<br />Qualtrics shares will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “XM.” SAP will retain a controlling stake in Qualtrics following the planned IPO, including all of the company’s Class B shares that give it extra voting rights.</td>

      <td>Maybe the GOP will stand up on trade once Joe Biden is picking winners.</td>
      <td>President Trump will soon leave town, but his tariffs may be staying. Joe Biden hasn’t been exactly clear about his trade policy, so perhaps it’s time to point out one unsightly effect of the Trump tariffs: expanding the D.C. swamp.<br />Republicans who cheered when the Trump Administration picked winners and losers might soon find out what it’s like when the Biden Administration does it. Take Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who lobbied last year for a company in his state, SM Products, to get tariff exclusions on imported Chinese-manufactured saw blades.<br />In a Sept. 19, 2019, letter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), four members of Missouri’s congressional delegation, including Mr. Hawley, argued that “it would not be beneficial to impair a small American company that does not have the financial resources or alternative supply chain options.” Since SM’s costs and prices are “locked in many months before delivery,” the legislators wrote, the Missouri company “must absorb the entire cost of the tariffs,” likely precluding profitability.<br />Join the club. Countless American businesses were in a similar situation. Most weren’t lucky enough—or connected enough—to have a U.S. Senator pleading their case. Yet you might be surprised. As Mr. Trump’s tariffs began to bite, Congress sent hundreds of letters to the USTR, supporting specific tariff exclusions. The examples here are taken from about 100 pages of correspondence from 2019, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request.<br />Mark Meadows, now the White House chief of staff, urged tariff exclusions in a Nov. 22, 2019, letter, aiming to prevent “severe economic harm to an important business in my district.” He said the USTR had “my wholehearted support in your work to combat Chinese intellectual property theft and industrial espionage.” But given how fast Mr. Trump’s tariffs were kicking in, “it was not possible for Fairfield Chair to develop a new relationship with a new supplier of similar quality.” Please, please don’t tax these beech wood components from China.</td>

      <td>The President writes a $2,000 check to make Democrats the majority.</td>
      <td>President Trump finally signed the Covid-19 relief bill and 2021 budget on Sunday night, but not before giving a big assist to Democratic hopes of gaining control of the Senate in the two runoff elections on Jan. 5. Current GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is left this week trying to undo the significant political damage.<br />Mr. Trump had been insisting that Congress write checks of $2,000 each to most Americans, rather than the $600 in the bill. His own Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, negotiated the $600 figure. But after the bill passed, Mr. Trump decided that wasn’t enough.<br />Never mind that the $2,000 would go to tens of millions of Americans who have kept their jobs and maintained their incomes during the pandemic. It would also add some $350 billion or more to a federal deficit that is already into the trillions of dollars. The economy won’t benefit since the recipients aren’t going to change their behavior knowing it’s merely a one-time check.<br />Senate Republicans oppose the $2,000 for these sound reasons, but Mr. Trump has put them in a political spot. Democrats immediately joined Mr. Trump’s call for the $2,000, and on Monday House Democrats were expected to vote to approve the extra cash.<br />That leaves Mr. McConnell with a tough call of barring a vote as Democrats bang away in TV ads in Georgia against GOP incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Or he can hold a vote, which would split the GOP caucus and upset fiscally conservative voters. Either way it amounts to a Donald Trump in-kind contribution to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden.</td>

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said Monday he would sign the bill, a move cheered by tenant advocates who said the state would be enacting one of the strictest eviction moratoriums in the country. Opponents said the legislation didn’t do enough to protect landlords and could prevent struggling building owners from paying their taxes.<br />The bill effectively bans all evictions statewide for 60 days, including those already in motion. After that, tenants who are unable to pay their rent because of the coronavirus pandemic can file paperwork to prevent or suspend eviction proceedings until May 1. Households where a member is at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 are also protected under the bill.<br />“You do not solve a public health crisis, you do not solve an economic crisis, by kicking people out on the street,” said state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, a Democrat from Brooklyn. “You solve it by keeping people in their homes.”<br />The state Senate voted Monday afternoon to approve the legislation, and the Assembly continued its debate into the evening.</td>

      <td>In a 2020 campaign with little foreign policy substance, the idea Joe Biden mentioned most was restoring alliances. Which alliances? With Mr. Biden’s inauguration less than four weeks away, some allies in the Asia-Pacific are apprehensive.<br />Last week Japan’s number-two civilian defense official told Reuters: “We are concerned China will expand its aggressive stance into areas other than Hong Kong. I think one of the next targets, or what everyone is worried about, is Taiwan.”<br />Yasuhide Nakayama added: “So far, I haven’t yet seen a clear policy or an announcement on Taiwan from Joe Biden. I would like to hear it quickly, then we can also prepare our response on Taiwan in accordance.” He also asked, according to Reuters, “How will Joe Biden in the White House react in any case if China crosses this red line?”<br />Hardliners in Beijing see democratic Taiwan as a separatist province and are determined to bring it under their control. They also want Taiwan’s advanced microchip technology. Meanwhile, opinion in Taiwan has moved against unification, especially as China reneges on its treaty obligations by arresting democracy supporters in Hong Kong. A Chinese military operation across the 110-mile Taiwan Strait during Mr. Biden’s term can’t be ruled out.<br />The loss of democratic Taiwan’s independence against its will would be a geopolitical earthquake. The Pacific balance of power would shift decisively in China’s favor. Asian countries would need to recalibrate their relationship with the U.S., with dramatic implications for global security and trade.</td>

      <td>President Trump signed into law another round of direct payments to households as part of a coronavirus aid package</td>
      <td>President Trump on Dec. 27 signed into law a roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid package that will provide a second round of stimulus payments to households. Here is what we know about who will receive the checks and how they will receive the money.<br />Households will get $600 per adult and $600 a child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round delivered earlier in the pandemic. That means a single parent with two children will get $1,800 now after receiving $2,200 in the spring.<br />In all, the government will spend $164 billion on the second round.<br />The payments start phasing out when individual adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000, when head-of-household income exceeds $112,500, and when income for married couples filing jointly exceeds $150,000. For individuals without children, the payments go to zero when income reaches $87,000; that is $174,000 for married couples. The numbers are generally based on 2019 income.<br />Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week, when Congress was finishing work on the package, that the first batch of payments could go out at the beginning of the Dec. 28 week. But Mr. Trump didn’t sign the package until Sunday night—six days after final congressional approval. A senior Treasury official on Monday said the department anticipates being able to make the $600 stimulus payments “on the same timeline as previously discussed.”</td>

      <td>Paternalism is the wrong approach. Patients need full information about the risks and benefits.</td>
      <td>Now that two Covid-19 vaccines have received emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, the conversation has turned to the crucial goal of persuading as many people as possible to get vaccinated. We worry that public-health authorities may follow strategies that do more harm than good.<br />The current communication strategy—built on listening to advice from trusted leaders—is paternalistic and outdated. Public-health authorities, politicians, sports heroes and celebrities are taking to the airwaves to tout the vaccines. Protecting people from doubt is central to the strategy. That entails suppressing questions rather than answering them. Any hint about vaccine imperfections could make people apprehensive and must be avoided. Anyone who rejects the vaccine is stigmatized as foolish and irresponsible.<br />A better approach to persuasion is to assume you’re speaking to mature, self-interested decision makers, offer transparent and comprehensive information about the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and engage patients in the decision-making process. Many medical treatments require consideration of the balance between harms and benefits. Over the past 40 years the practice of medicine has evolved to embrace a process known as shared medical decision-making, in which physicians provide patients with the best scientific information about benefits and risks, and patients make decisions in collaboration with their doctors, which balance their personal preferences with imperfect science and uncertain risks. The same decision isn’t right for everyone.<br />Applying shared decision-making to the coronavirus vaccine requires authorities to change their mind-set. Instead of pressuring patients to “do the right thing,” the emphasis would be on honest disclosure about what to expect. In recent FDA hearings for the  Pfizer  and the Moderna vaccines, multiple witnesses pointed to higher-than-expected side-effect rates. For both vaccines, these rates appear to be higher than those for other commonly used inoculations, such Pneumovax 23 and Shingrix, for which patients frequently report side effects.<br />In both Covid-19 trials, substantial majorities of participants in the vaccine group had local reactions at the injection site. More than half of participants experienced a systemic side effect like fatigue, headache or fever. In both studies there were a few cases of Bell’s palsy, a temporary or lasting partial paralysis of the face. These were attributed to chance because they were rare, but seven of the eight total cases in the two studies were among those who received the vaccine rather than a placebo.</td>

Trust me, today’s America is nothing like it was then. And even under segregation, the marginalization was not total. My father was a plumber, my mother a school librarian. We were treated kindly. The local shopkeepers wanted our business, but they also wanted to avoid trouble from the few who believed wholeheartedly in racial segregation.<br />The segregation wasn’t uniform. One doctor had a separate waiting room; the other didn’t. Ditto for the town’s two dentists. Once the 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawed separate facilities, things opened up very quickly.<br />Many of the authors, commentators and journalists who spend all their energy thinking and talking about race today fail to acknowledge how much has improved with regard to race in this country. There are countless successful black Americans today—doctors and lawyers, entrepreneurs and academics, journalists and artists, compassionate politicians and famous Hollywood actors. Their numbers will keep growing as long as we remember six things:<br />First, every life matters. Mine is not one cell more or less valuable than anyone else’s.

Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said that providers that ignore   this will face fines of up to $1 million and a revocation of all state licenses.<br />In addition, Mr. Cuomo said that the state attorney general’s office would now be handling a case involving ParCare Community Health Network, a health-care provider with offices in New York City and Orange County. State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said over the weekend that ParCare was being investigated by the state police for possibly obtaining the vaccine fraudulently and then transferring it to other parts of the state and administering it to the public without paying heed to the prioritization rules.<br />Ultimately, Mr. Cuomo said he wants “to send a clear signal” that the state won’t tolerate attempts to subvert the process it has put in place for vaccine distribution and administration.<br />“If you violate the law on these vaccinations, we will find out and you will be prosecuted,” he said.</td>

Both also benefit from a U.S. press corps uninterested in getting to the bottom of their stories.<br />When the New York Post published emails in October raising doubts about Joe Biden’s claims he’d never discussed his son’s business dealings, many dismissed the story as “Russian disinformation”—and some suppressed it. As for Mr. Swalwell’s China connection, the  New York Times  still refuses even to mention it.<br />But it isn’t just the Biden and Swalwell stories the press is missing. Their cases are only a microcosm of what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo complains is an all-out Chinese Communist Party effort “to make Americans receptive to Beijing’s form of authoritarianism.” China does this on multiple fronts, often masquerading under the banner of “friendship” associations.

By his own admission even most Democrats don’t share his socialist views, yet all Americans are bearing the burden of a rapid expansion of government. So why can’t Mr. Sanders relax and enjoy the moment?<br />With President Donald Trump’s signing of the latest Covid-related spending bill, another $900 billion adds to a federal intervention this year  that was already historic. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) pegs the grand total around $5 trillion. The organization hopefully assumes some economic benefits from the legislation for an optimistic but still staggering net cost of $3.5 trillion over five years.<br />And for some reason, even though vaccines are being distributed, the  economy is growing and employment has increased for seven straight months—for a total of 12 million jobs added since the spring shutdowns—President-elect Joe Biden is still suggesting that much more massive government intervention is required.<br />In October CRFB estimated the Biden agenda would add more than $10 trillion in new spending over a decade (not even counting new Covid spending), partially funded by more than $4 trillion in new taxes. To make it happen Mr. Biden has introduced an economic team of activists largely unblemished by market experience.<br />The Biden program is bound to discourage entrepreneurial creativity.

      <td><br /><br />On April 24, rapper and singer Post Malone, born Austin Post, strapped on a guitar and stood in front of a camera to perform Nirvana covers for more than an hour. The live-streamed event raised money for Covid relief and was one of the more successful early experiments in providing a concert experience during the lockdown, raising more than $500,000 with 200,000 people watching at one point.<br />Mr. Post’s own music—a spare and low-key hybrid of rap and pop—sounds nothing like Nirvana, but his rendering of the Seattle grunge band’s catalog led to hosannas from former Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, along with Kurt Cobain’s widow, Hole frontwoman Courtney Love. And this was even more notable since Mr. Post, age 25, was born in 1995, the year after Mr. Cobain died by suicide. The live-stream was one highly visible moment among many in 2020 that confirmed how thoroughly ’90s alternative rock—both the heavier and folkier varieties—has now become part of the musical conversation for those who were too young to experience it firsthand.<br />Among the most highly anticipated debut albums of 2020 was “Fake It Flowers” from 20-year-old Filipino-British singer-songwriter Beatrice Laus, who performs as Beabadoobee. In 2019, Ms. Laus released a single called “I Wish I Was Stephen Malkmus,” the frontman of the quintessential ’90s indie rock band Pavement. Her LP transports the thick guitar sound of that decade and its quiet-versus-loud choruses into the present moment. While plenty of indie rock bands have touched on grunge over the years, her record channeled the more accessible end of the genre and imparted a veneer of slickness. “Fake It Flowers” made some year-end lists, was a modest success on its own terms, and offers a glimpse at how the sound of ’90s rock might be integrated into the pop of the future.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The House prepared to vote Monday on overriding President Trump’s veto of the annual defense-policy bill, in a late flurry of congressional action that also includes the first test of the president’s call for $2,000 stimulus checks.<br />Mr. Trump signed a sweeping $900 billion pandemic-aid bill Sunday night, ending a standoff with Congress and paving the way for millions of Americans to get economic relief as the coronavirus surges across the country. In signing the bill, the president called on Congress to increase the size of direct payments to Americans and said he wanted an investigation into alleged voter fraud and the repeal of a law concerning social-media companies.<br />Mr. Trump’s decision to sign the aid bill came after extensive lobbying from Republican lawmakers and advisers, said people familiar with the conversations.<br />Mr. Trump made the final decision Sunday during a phone call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), said a person with knowledge of the talks. But it came after days of consultation with aides and allies, among them former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.<br />Allies argued that blocking the bill could hurt the chances of Republicans running in a Georgia special election on Jan. 5 that will determine control of the Senate. They also urged Mr. Trump to consider his political legacy and encouraged him to sign the bill while still pressing Congress to do more.</td>

She was charged with aiding an enemy country and destabilizing the Saudi regime, as well as speaking with foreign journalists and diplomats, contacting Saudi dissidents living abroad and applying for a job at the United Nations.<br />The Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh, a tribunal set up in 2008 to try al Qaeda suspects, sentenced her Monday to five years and eight months in jail, starting from the date of her arrest, according to her family and people familiar with the case. A reduction for time served means she will likely be released in March on three years’ probation, with a five-year travel ban.<br />Ms. Hathloul, who has been kept largely in solitary confinement and held a two-week hunger strike in November to protest her prison conditions, has appeared physically weak in court, her body shaking and voice faint. She has previously testified to torture by her captors, including electrocution, lashing and sexual harassment, claims the Saudi judiciary has repeatedly denied.<br />“Loujain cried when she heard the sentence today,” her sister Lina al-Hathloul said in a tweet. “After nearly 3 years of arbitrary detention, torture, solitary confinement—they now sentence her and label her a terrorist.”</td>

One tip in particular, he said, gave investigators a name and led them to places to search for forensic evidence to match to tissue found at the site of the bombing. That tissue was analyzed by forensic scientists at the TBI, as well as at a Federal Bureau of Investigation lab at Quantico, Va.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday it has set its first-ever climate standards for commercial airliners and large business jets, aligning U.S. rules with global standards and giving jet makers eight years to comply.<br />The move follows years of momentum internationally to address the airline industry’s contribution to climate change. The sector accounts for about 2% of the global carbon emissions that are warming the planet, according to U.S. data and environmental groups. The EPA first proposed the rule in July while under legal pressure from environmental groups and amid concern from U.S. jet-makers about international sales.<br />The new rules create efficiency standards to limit carbon-dioxide and nitrous-oxide emissions from commercial airliners and large business jets in the U.S. starting in 2028. Aircraft companies have to apply the limits to any new designs starting this year.<br />The core of these regulations adopt metrics established by the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations’ commercial-aviation regulator. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in July that the U.S. aviation industry had made it clear the agency should be adopting those standards to ensure consistency globally.<br />The EPA’s action helps prevent U.S. jets from getting shut out of the international market. U.S. manufacturers export three of every four aircraft they make, the EPA has said, and U.S. companies face the potential of losing those sales if their planes don’t meet international standards.</td>

      <td>PARIS—Three French soldiers were killed in Mali on Monday when their vehicle hit a bomb during operations under France’s counterterrorism mission in the West African nation, the French government said.<br />France has more than 5,000 soldiers deployed in an area spanning thousands of miles from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to Chad in the east. Over the past seven years, the forces have fought branches of Islamic State, al Qaeda and other militant groups, which roam the region’s isolated villages and threaten government forces in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and elsewhere.<br />The soldiers killed Monday were conducting operations around Hombori, a small town in Mali’s central Mopti province, as part of the French military’s Operation Barkhane campaign against Islamist militants across the Sahel region of Africa, authorities said. They identified the soldiers as Tanerii Mauri, Dorian Issakhanian and Quentin Pauchet. The three soldiers were from a military regiment based in the town of Thierville-sur-Meuse in the east of France, they said.<br />Their deaths bring French fatalities to at least 47 soldiers during the current operation and the short operation before it, which began in 2013. That includes an accident in November 2019, when two French helicopters collided during a mission in northern Mali, killing 13 soldiers.<br />The U.S. military has provided key support to the French operation, including drone surveillance and other intelligence-gathering activities. In 2017, Islamist militants killed four U.S. soldiers based in Niger.</td>

      <td>Short pieces from 20 Irish composers, a serial space opera and a trio of works inspired by famous diaries.</td>
      <td><br />With opera gone digital due to the Covid-19 pandemic, fans can experience voices, composers and opera companies they might never otherwise have heard. The Irish National Opera commissioned short (five- to eight-minute) pieces from 20 Irish composers. Recorded in Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and filmed in a lively variety of styles, the resulting “20 Shots of Opera”, available free, is an exhilarating jaunt through up-to-the-minute lyric creativity. Unlike the experience of losing yourself in the lengthy grandeur of more traditional operas, you absorb these intimate quick takes like jolts of recognition.<br />In the opening comedy, “Mrs. Streicher” by Gerald Barry, the best-known of the composers, a tenor sits at a table ranting furiously about servants and laundry, with interjections from a tuba. The text is from Beethoven’s letters. Several pieces explore separation: In Éna Brennan’s “Rupture,” a soprano duels with her inner, critical voice; in Hannah Peel’s “Close,” two women have an awkward first in-person, socially distanced date. One powerful group of works looks at death: In Alex Dowling’s “Her Name,” a sweet-voiced choirboy mourns his mother; Michael Gallen’s “At a Loss” is a large-scale diva turn, as the soprano awaits news of her mother’s death; Andrew Hamilton’s “Erth Upon Erth” is a wordless howl, starting with a woman’s mouth in close-up and ending with her zipped into a body bag on a gurney.<br />Operas made just for film can inspire highly creative visuals. “Verballing” by David Coonan employs black-and-white animation. A female police officer, getting schooled in how to question a murder suspect, sings just one word—“Yeah,” repeated higher and higher. The instructions appear only in type, and as the tension mounts, the background dissolves so that her white face floats in a sea of darkness. In the hilarious “A Message for Marty (or `The Ring’)” by Conor Mitchell, two sisters call out an ex (who dumped one of them by text); the jittery cellphone picture, the tacky costumes, and the escalating fury, plus a snippet of Wagner, is opera extremism in modern dress.<br />Most of the pieces are for women’s voices, exploring different timbres and expressivity. I was struck by the fierce intensity of mezzo Naomi Louisa O’Connell in Emma O’Halloran’s “The Wait,” and the simple, folk-like cadences of Benedict Schlepper-Connolly’s “Dust,” a lament for the natural world, poignantly sung by Michelle O’Rourke. And the insidiously floating and twisting soprano line of “Libris Solar,” sung by Claudia Boyle, made me want to hear something longer from composer Jennifer Walshe.</td>

      <td>If Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh is freed by a Pakistani court, he must face American justice.</td>
      <td>I was sworn in as U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey on Jan. 17, 2002. Six days later, Daniel Pearl, South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped in Karachi, Pakistan. Pearl was investigating a story about the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, and had been promised by his kidnappers that they would take him to meet Sheikh Mubarak Ali Gilani. Pearl believed Sheikh Mubarak had information regarding Mr. Reid, the British terrorist who attempted to detonate an explosive device in his shoe aboard a Paris-to-Miami flight in December 2001. Pearl never met Sheikh Mubarak—the meeting was a setup—and he was never seen again. The killers released a videotape of Pearl’s murder.<br />The Pearl investigation was my baptism into the world of terrorism. We were all still reeling from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The FBI had set up a command center at the South Brunswick, N.J., headquarters of Dow Jones, the Journal’s publisher. Through the combined efforts of the Justice Department and Pakistani authorities, three men were identified as having taken part in the abduction. Their organization, the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, had been sending ransom demands to the Dow Jones computer servers in New Jersey. Through great computer forensics, the task force of combined American and Pakistani authorities was able to identify and arrest three people, including the mastermind of the abduction, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh.<br />Mr. Sheikh already had a record of terrorism. In 1994, then a member of Harkat ul-Ansar, an Islamic militant organization, he was convicted of kidnapping four people, including an American in India. He was jailed in India but after his terrorist friends hijacked an Indian Airlines flight, Mr. Sheikh was freed in exchange for the passengers. With assistance from the Taliban, he made his way to Afghanistan.<br />Mr. Sheikh was indicted in March 2002 by a New Jersey grand jury for the kidnapping of Pearl resulting in his murder. The indictment is still viable and it is a case for which the U.S. can seek the death penalty. In announcing the indictment, Attorney General John Ashcroft also announced the unsealing of an indictment charging Mr. Sheikh with the kidnapping of the American tourist in India.<br />Mr. Sheikh and his co-conspirators were also charged in Pakistan. They were tried in 2002 and convicted. While his accomplices were given life sentences, Mr. Sheikh was sentenced to death. His appeal languished until April, when a Pakistani court ordered the release of all the defendants on the grounds that there was conflicting testimony at the original trial and insufficient evidence to support the murder charge. The Pakistani authorities have been fighting the release and have kept Mr. Sheikh jailed. But on Thursday the court again ordered his release.</td>

      <td>Voters who chose him still have faith in public institutions. His goal should be to reassure the rest.</td>
      <td>Many Americans were taken aback when 126 members of Congress joined a specious lawsuit to overturn last month’s presidential election. It appeared to be the latest, most glaring evidence that the country’s commitment to its constitutional system is in decline. But there’s reason for hope. Hyperbolic calls to abandon the core institutions of American life—demands to forsake capitalism from the left, and vicious, norm-busting partisanship from Donald Trump’s Republicans—were defeated handily this year. The result of the presidential election showed that beyond repudiating President Trump, Americans are seeking renewal and revitalization.<br />To be sure, polarization is a real and serious problem. But this election was less about whether the U.S. would tack left or right, and more about whether the country would embrace compassion. Americans rejected the radical vituperation proselytized on the fringes and chose the optimistic tradition of social justice associated with Pope John XXIII. (I know that may sound strange coming from a practicing Jew, but here we are.) The man who decisively defeated Mr. Trump reflects the “silent majority” of Americans, who believe in renewing rather than revolutionizing our political and economic systems. Rooted in faith, Joe Biden’s promise to “save the soul of the nation” reflected his determination to address the political, economic and cultural alienation that fuels fervor on the far right and left alike.<br />Those who feel vindicated by Mr. Biden’s victory shouldn’t lose sight of how we got here—or how we got President Trump four years ago. A significant minority of the country is angry, and their anger is, at root, entirely legitimate. Trump supporters and the far left both sense that in today’s America the powerful few get ahead and don’t see, hear or value everyday people. I realize that people on either edge of the political spectrum naturally take offense at being lumped in with the other lot. But everyone who still champions democratic capitalism—and that’s most of us—needs to realize that the calls for revolution from right and left have a common foundation in grievance and estrangement.<br />Their uproar was a long time coming. Many of today’s radicalized voters come from families who sacrificed when the country went to war over phantom weapons of mass destruction and watched the responsible policy makers get off scot-free. Their communities were decimated by the financial crisis, and banks got bailouts while victims were left holding the bag. Today they struggle to afford college even as celebrities lie and cheat to get their children into elite schools. Over the years they’ve grown to believe that there are two sets of rules in the U.S.—one for the rich and powerful, and one for everyone else. They’re not entirely wrong.<br />But the solution isn’t to blow up the system, ignoring the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box. Nor is it right for proponents of America’s institutions to castigate, shun, cancel or demonize those who have lost faith. Both camps have become ideologically tribal, and Mr. Trump was particularly adept at exploiting the desire to find fellowship in grievance. But the first step in reconciliation or bridging a political divide is to control any impulse to dismiss the other side, and instead reach for mutual understanding. That’s why Americans should adopt Mr. Biden’s belief that everyone counts, that everyone’s voice matters, and that our collective responsibility is to ensure that the country can “grow together.”</td>

Public-health officials say that despite the introduction of the first two Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S., additional vaccines will be needed to meet demand and control the pandemic.<br />“We’ve come this far, this fast, but we need to get to the finish line,” said Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, which is helping to fund the Novavax study. “That will require multiple vaccines using different approaches to ensure everyone is protected safely and effectively from this deadly disease.”<br />The company didn’t say when it expects to generate results from the new study, but it will likely be spring at the earliest. Studies of the first two vaccines from  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  took nearly four months for results to become available.<br />U.S. regulators authorized emergency use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines this month.

Her first hypnosis session, which took place in person with a clinician, was so anxiety-producing that she had to have a cigarette afterward.<br />Reveri Health, one of a new generation of hypnosis programs and apps that make the practice easily accessible at home, then required her to take part in interactive, self-hypnosis sessions at home for a month. After two of the digital sessions, she was shocked to discover that she no longer felt like smoking. “The craving was really gone,” she says. “I can’t explain it.

      <td>Regarding David Satter’s op-ed “Soviet Politics, American Style” (Dec. 23): As a younger man serving in our military, I saw an extraordinary thing on two continents. In both Europe and Asia, the idea of a border wall was turned on its head. No longer were walls built to keep invaders out but to keep people in. I have seen governments so loathed that minefields, guard towers and canine patrols were required to keep inmates, euphemistically called citizens, from escaping their borders. At its most benign, socialism requires compulsion and control of state media. A fair telling of this ill-conceived experiment might disabuse our young of its allure.<br />Conan M. Ward<br />Princeton, N.J.<br /><br />A warning against groupthink is useful. But a warning like Mr. Satter’s, solely against groupthink on the left, is only a warning against the left styled as a defense of liberal norms. Today’s right doesn’t like dissent, either. For many Republican politicians, accepting the election result would have “ended any hope of a career,” to use Mr. Satter’s words. Talk about an “attempt to impose a deluded version of reality.” The right’s leader cultivates a personality cult and campaigns against “enemies of the people.” These are core Soviet practices.</td>

Getting tougher economically will be, well, tough.<br />Despite four years of pressure from the Trump administration, China’s economy actually is stronger in some ways at the moment than is the economy of the West. Though China has plenty of its own problems, international capital is flowing in, not out. Within Asia, China actually has improved its trade position.<br />“China is in a strong negotiating situation,” says Josh Lipsky, director of programs and policy at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center. He adds: “The centrifugal forces coming out of China are stronger than they were in 2017.”<br />Indeed, the International Monetary Fund projects that China’s economy will expand by 1.9% in 2020, which means it is likely to be the only major world economy to grow in this year of the coronavirus pandemic. By contrast, the American economy is expected to shrink by 4.3%, and the eurozone is forecast to contract by 8.3%.</td>

      <td>A new book debunks popular myths, including ‘that your inner primal macho ripped hunter-gatherer ancestor is who you were meant to be.’</td>
      <td>One of the biggest myths about exercise is that it’s natural. If anything, human instincts lean more toward taking a nap. Want to feel bad about skipping a workout? Blame evolution.<br />Daniel E. Lieberman argues this theory in his new book “Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved to Do Is Healthy and Rewarding,” which tips some of the fitness world’s most sacred cows. Everyone knows exercise is good for them, yet studies show most people don’t get enough of it. Mr. Lieberman set out to find out why, and the answers, he hopes, will help remove some of the shame people feel about their own inactivity that makes it even harder to get moving.<br />Mr. Lieberman criticizes people he calls “exercists” who brag about how much they work out and pass judgment on the less fit as unnaturally lazy. Those who take the escalator instead of the stairs are not guilty of the sin of sloth, he writes, but doing what they were evolved to do—saving energy only for what is necessary or recreational.<br />Other highlights from the book out Jan. 5: People who believe brutal cross-training workouts bring them closer to the brawny body that belonged to their ancient forebears probably are not familiar with research that shows Neanderthals were only slightly more muscular than today’s regular humans. Fitness buffs who think civilization’s pampering has muted our natural strength might not realize that a profoundly inactive couch potato moves more than a typical chimpanzee in a day. As for our natural talents, it bears noting that the average person runs as fast as a hippo.<br />Mr. Lieberman, 56, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University, helped popularize barefoot running in the U.S. after publishing a paper in Nature on how and why people ran barefoot before the invention of shoes. In this book, the biological anthropologist hails the benefits of fitness and recommends beating the anti-exercise instinct by working out with friends and making commitments like registering for a race. His philosophy: Any movement is an improvement on none, more is usually better, and it is never too late to start.</td>

      <td>Treasury yields might finally have seen their historic low. The question is how long the Fed will slow their ascent.</td>
      <td>Long-term Treasury yields seem poised to move up in the first half of 2021, but the Federal Reserve may set a limit on how high they can go.<br />At 0.95%, the yield on the 10-year Treasury is up from the levels it plumbed earlier this year but is near a historic low. That reflects bond-market investors’ continued uncertainty about how strong the economy will be on the other side of the pandemic and whether higher inflation will take hold. It also reflects a promise from the Fed that it will keep its target range on overnight rates near zero until it sees evidence of a tight labor market and inflation has obviously cleared its 2% target rate, and that it will keep buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage bonds each month until jobs and inflation have made “substantial further progress.”<br />Investors’ hesitancy on the economy and inflation should ease as spring approaches, however. As more of the population gets vaccinated and warm weather returns, spending on services in particular will likely rebound. Inflation should pick up as well, in part because, starting in March, the year-ago inflation comparison will be with when the pandemic first hit, but also because rebounding demand will at least temporarily boost prices. As that occurs, belief in the Fed’s low-rate promise could start to wear thin. It is, after all, one thing for the central bank to say it will keep rates low when the country is still in the grips of a crisis and another when the crisis is receding.<br />But Fed officials also might try to limit how much Treasury yields rise. Memories of the 2013 “taper tantrum,” when expectations the Fed was about to reduce its bond purchases pushed yields higher, stifling the recovery, are still fresh. Moreover, after a yearlong policy review, the Fed this summer concluded that it should allow for catch-up periods after inflation has been below its target—effectively saying that it should keep rates lower than it has in the past. Next year could see the Fed taking pains to remind investors of that change in stance.<br />Still, the 10-year yield might need to be closer to 2% than 1% before the Fed starts complaining. The lowest long-term rates that investors will ever see might already have come and gone.</td>

But many employers still use minimum wages to set pay rates.

With negligible foreign investment, that means debt has mounted both at developers and the families buying the properties.<br />As recently as 1978, virtually no housing was privately owned in China. Creeping experimental reforms led to the beginning of wholesale privatization of the public housing stock in 1988. In the early and mid-1990s, the real-estate giants of today—and their future billionaire owners—were just coming into existence.<br />In December 1987, Shenzhen held its first auction of land use rights, a practice mimicking the sales conducted a few miles south in Hong Kong, still under British control at the time. The model would eventually be adopted by municipalities across the country and become a major source of funding for cash-strapped local governments.</td>

      <td>Company’s Hong Kong-listed shares slumped 8% Monday, extending a Christmas Eve selloff as investors reassess regulatory risks</td>
      <td>No longer China’s most valuable company,  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  has erased almost all its stock-market gains this year, just days after Chinese regulators signaled a major change in their posture toward the e-commerce behemoth and its finance affiliate, Ant Group Co.<br />Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares tumbled a further 8% on Monday, after China’s central bank released a harshly worded statement Sunday criticizing Ant’s business practices and instructing the financial-technology giant to shift its focus back to its mainstay—and less lucrative—digital-payments business.<br />The declines extended a stock selloff on Christmas Eve, taking Alibaba’s market capitalization down to $586 billion. Just two months earlier, it had hit a record of nearly $859 billion on expectations that Alibaba would profit handsomely from Ant’s public listing.<br />Alibaba’s swift comedown has led investors to reassess the regulatory risks faced by Chinese internet companies. Last Thursday, the country’s top commerce regulator said it is investigating whether Alibaba abused its dominant market position in online retailing through activities such as making merchants sell products exclusively on its platforms.<br />The hard part is figuring out “how much of the recent regulatory moves against Ant and Alibaba is politically based, how far it will go, and when it will be over,” said Alex Au, managing director at Alphalex Capital Management, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund. He said he is considering buying Alibaba shares if they fall further.</td>

      <td>For some traders, U.S. crude futures prices plunging below zero in April highlighted their flaws as a global benchmark</td>
      <td>A tumultuous year in oil markets left the energy industry reeling and gave fresh impetus to a perennial debate: What is the best gauge of crude prices?<br />The Covid-19 pandemic confined billions of people to their homes and shut or slowed portions of the global economy in 2020, crimping demand for oil. Depots, pipelines and vessels were flooded with crude, threatening to overwhelm the world’s ability to store it.<br />The crisis reached its crescendo in April, when the price of light, sweet U.S. crude futures dived below $0 a barrel for the first time. Some traders were paying others to take oil off their hands.<br />“What we saw was the single largest demand event in history,” said Peter Keavey, managing director for energy products at  CME  Group, owner of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where U.S. crude futures trade.<br />Prices have since somewhat recovered. But those jarring moves of the spring added urgency to arguments about whether benchmarks used since the 1980s adequately reflect the modern oil market. Newer gauges, including Shanghai-traded futures and a contract for Abu Dhabi’s Murban crude that will make its debut in March, are expected to grow in popularity.</td>

      <td>The SolarWinds hack has boosted shares of the former cybersecurity star, but the benefits aren’t so clear-cut</td>
      <td>Going from predator to prey back to predator again has been a profitable ride for  FireEye  investors. How it works out for the company itself remains to be seen.<br />High-profile network breaches have often been a boon for cybersecurity stocks, and the massive  SolarWinds  hack has been no exception. The NYSE FactSet Global Cyber Security Index has jumped 13% since the attack was reported on Dec. 13. The 12 largest pure-play vendors on that index are now up an average 20% in that time.<br />The attack used a flaw in the network-management software sold by SolarWinds, a Texas-based IT company that counts many federal agencies as customers. But ironically, it was brought to light by FireEye, which specializes in hack investigations and was itself a victim of the attack.<br />It has been a wild ride. FireEye’s shares sank 13% after it reported the breach of its own system on Dec. 8. That seemed like very bad news for a company that is often the first call for other companies who suffer an attack. Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard warned at the time that FireEye faced a clear risk of “reputational damage,” even as the company described the attack as the work of “a highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.”<br />But since more news has dribbled out about the scale of the attack and SolarWinds’ centrality to it, sentiment shifted hard. FireEye’s shares have soared 66% from their initial selloff and are now up 49% this month—beating out even other red-hot cybersecurity names such as  CrowdStrike  and  Zscaler  that analysts believe will be the primary beneficiaries of increased corporate IT security spending. Those two are up 44% and 32% for the month, respectively, and more than 300% for the year. SolarWinds, by contrast, has lost one-third of its market value since the attack became public.</td>
