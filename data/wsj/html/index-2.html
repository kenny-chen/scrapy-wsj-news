Joining concludes the Fed’s status as a lone hold out from an effort that counts the European Central Bank, the  Bank of Japan ,  the Bank of Canada and many others as members.<br />The formal membership wasn’t unexpected. The Fed’s point man for financial regulation, Randal Quarles, noted recently that the U.S. central bank had sought to join after it had already been engaging with the group on an informal basis.<br />In a statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said “as we develop our understanding of how best to assess the impact of climate change on the financial system, we look forward to continuing and deepening our discussions with our NGFS colleagues from around the world.”<br />The network, which launched three years ago, is a forum for central bankers and regulators to come together and discuss how their institutions can ensure their financial systems don’t worsen climate change risks, and how financial institutions might be able to lower those risks.</td>

      <td>Deputy attorney general never worked as a prosecutor but has taken a leading role at the Justice Department in recent corporate cases</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who President Trump said Monday would succeed outgoing Attorney General William Barr, is expected to lead the Justice Department in an acting capacity until President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.<br />Since his confirmation to the No. 2 post in May 2019, Mr. Rosen has taken a leading role on some corporate cases, including the antitrust case against Google. He doesn’t have prior experience as a prosecutor.<br />He will take over the top job at the Justice Department upon Mr. Barr’s departure on Dec. 23. Mr. Barr resigned on Monday. Other Justice Department officials said they didn’t expect Mr. Rosen to deviate from Mr. Barr’s policies. However, they noted he had been involved in sensitive litigation that the White House had an interest in, including a lawsuit against Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, over the publication of his book in June.<br />Mr. Rosen has spent most of his career in the private sector and at several other government agencies. They include the Transportation Department where he served in the No. 2 job before joining the Justice Department as deputy attorney general.<br />In October, Mr. Rosen, 62 years old, unveiled the Justice Department’s case against Google, alleging that the search giant is illegally preserving its monopoly status by engaging in anticompetitive tactics that shut out future innovators from challenging its dominance. “I think we do go through these tech phases,” Mr. Rosen said in an interview at the time, adding: “I think it’s not uncommon that they raise some antitrust issues.”</td>

Those blank-check companies raise capital by going public and can put the proceeds into deals.<br />Group Nine Media is interested in acquisitions that could grow its audience and give it more bargaining power with online advertisers.<br />The venture-backed company, which formed in 2016 through the merger of several digital-media businesses, has already begun buying competitors. Last year, it purchased PopSugar, a women-focused digital publisher, adding its site and web properties to a portfolio that includes animal-focused The Dodo and NowThis, a news publisher.<br />It isn’t clear which company or companies Group Nine Media would target for acquisitions. Group Nine’s all-stock deal with PopSugar valued Group Nine at $600 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.</td>

      <td>The Attorney General was the right man for the job in hyper-partisan times.</td>
      <td>William Barr resigned as Attorney General on Monday, effective Dec. 23, and he’s certainly earned the right to leave early. He has been the right man at the right time for that difficult job, with the principles and toughness to make difficult decisions despite bitter Democrats in Congress and a willful President Trump.<br />Mr. Barr had already been AG once so he didn’t need the title. He took the job in a Washington marked by no-limits partisanship knowing that he would be criticized no matter what he did. But he wanted to clean up a Justice Department that he rightly knew had been tainted by a corrupt FBI under James Comey and political appointees in both parties who lacked the courage or tenacity to take responsibility for hard prosecutorial judgments.<br />His achievements included navigating the end of the Robert Mueller probe while protecting the office of the Presidency from unconstitutional conclusions about obstruction of justice. Future Presidents of both parties will thank him.<br />He was willing to endure media and Democratic smears by taking fresh looks at old investigations. This included hiring U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine how the FBI could decide to investigate the 2016 Trump campaign as a Russian front. His release of documents has helped to show the FBI probe began in partisan scheming and unlawful practices, and Mr. Durham is staying on the job and may have more to report and indictments.<br />Mr. Barr also had the guts to ask another U.S. Attorney, Jeffrey Jensen, to re-examine Mr. Mueller’s prosecution of Michael Flynn. That probe turned up more malpractice and a decision to dismiss charges that never should have been brought. Mr. Barr used the lessons of these misguided probes to impose new rules and limits on political investigations.</td>

      <td>Holding the next AG accountable for how the case is handled.</td>
      <td>Even as Attorney General William Barr prepares to leave office after resigning on Monday (see nearby), effective Dec. 23, Republicans and many on the right are demanding that he appoint a special counsel to investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. The better idea is to make the next AG responsible for how that case is handled.<br />Hunter acknowledged last week that his “tax affairs” are under investigation by federal prosecutors, who are also looking into his influence-peddling via deals with Chinese interests and a Ukrainian gas company. Most of the media ignored the story before the election, and we warned this could create troubles for a President Biden. And here we are.<br />One problem among many with special counsels is that they are often politically unaccountable, wandering into areas far beyond their remit. Robert Mueller’s team never did find proof of Russia-Trump collusion. But they did torment Michael Flynn on an unrelated charge that was unjustly brought. A special counsel can also bury a case in secret for years, and an AG can duck questions by saying that’s the special counsel’s job.<br />The U.S. Attorney for Delaware is reported to have opened a Hunter investigation in 2018, and there is good reason to believe it can complete its work—barring political interference. This would be the preferred outcome, since Democrats would have a harder time claiming any future charges brought by career prosecutors were politically motivated. Meantime, any effort by a Biden Justice Department to transfer staff, dictate outcomes, or shut down the probe would leak and have political costs.<br />A Republican Senate would also be watching if the GOP secures at least one Georgia runoff seat on Jan. 5. The country was alerted to Hunter’s potential legal jeopardy by Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley, who in September issued a detailed report about Hunter’s deals in Ukraine, Russia, China and Kazakhstan. The Senators continue to investigate and they’d have subpoena power.</td>

      <td>President-elect will soon make his choices to head the EPA and Interior Department, among other positions</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden is nearing a final decision on environment-related jobs that are being watched closely by the energy industry as well as progressives who are concerned about Mr. Biden’s commitment to ambitious climate policies and diversity.<br />Mr. Biden is expected to announce as soon as later this week his nominees to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, as well as a senior White House official in charge of coordinating domestic climate-change policies, people familiar with the matter said.<br />Advisers to the president-elect said he hadn’t yet finalized his picks, but leading contenders are emerging. Mr. Biden is balancing several factors, including diversity, gender and geography, the people said, along with expertise in areas like environmental justice, which calls for laws and regulations to treat historically disadvantaged groups fairly. Much of the decision-making is connected, with choices for some posts influencing who gets chosen for others.<br />Rep. Deb Haaland (D., N.M.) is a leading contender for Interior secretary, according to people familiar with the matter. If confirmed, she would be the first Native American cabinet secretary. Activists and progressives are pushing for a Native American to run the agency, which oversees federal lands and the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Ms. Haaland’s stock has risen among some of Mr. Biden’s advisers in recent days. But some Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about losing another lawmaker to the administration because of their slim majority in the House.<br />Ms. Haaland and Biden teams are in discussions, but no offer has been made, according to a person familiar with the matter. Retiring Sen. Tom Udall (D., N.M.), whose father served as Interior secretary, is also among the potential candidates, as is former Deputy Interior Secretary Michael Connor, who also has Native American heritage.</td>

      <td>Senate Democrats lay out their green agenda for financial markets.</td>
      <td>Democrats accuse President Trump of politicizing the Federal Reserve, and sometimes not without cause. But look who’s now demanding that the central bank and other financial regulators accommodate their plans to politically allocate capital.<br />The Senate Democrats’ Special Committee on the Climate Crisis recently issued a report detailing how the Fed and eight other regulatory agencies should penalize investment in fossil fuels and promote green energy. They claim financial institutions are underpricing the risk that carbon-intensive assets will become “stranded.”<br />Mind you, their worry isn’t about how climate change per se would devalue investments, which financial institutions already account for. They want a warning about the costs of government climate policies. “Because Congress has not advanced any comprehensive climate policies in the last decade, the market has not priced in the possibility of significant federal action,” the report notes.<br />“This process—or more accurately, the mere realization that this process is imminent—will drive down the value of assets tied to the carbon-sensitive energy, electric power, and transportation sectors, among others,” Democrats warn. “The risk of holding this type of asset, which will lose value in a low-carbon economy, is referred to as transition risk.” In other words, Democrats want to kill your business, so please account for the hospitalization and burial costs.<br />For starters, Democrats want the Fed to use capital and liquidity standards and annual stress tests to make banks—and potentially also insurers and asset managers—price in these unknowable political risks. They want regulators to assign carbon-intensive assets higher risk weights, so banks would have to hold more capital against them. This would discourage banks from financing such investments, while “green” investments would be deemed lower risk.</td>

      <td>Another diplomatic normalization shows Israel’s greater clout.</td>
      <td>Israel’s era of diplomatic good feeling presses on, with the Jewish state winning recognition last week from Morocco in North Africa and over the weekend from Bhutan in South Asia. The majority-Buddhist Himalayan kingdom of less than a million people may not be a strategic powerhouse, but its normalization shows that Israel’s new diplomatic standing extends beyond the Persian Gulf.<br />Unlike the Abraham Accords involving the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, the U.S. didn’t broker the deal between Israel and Bhutan. The agreement was signed in India. Yet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that Bhutan’s recognition was “additional fruit of the peace agreements.”<br />It’s also fruit of Israel’s economic and strategic clout in South Asia. India’s trade with Israel—including military equipment—has been steadily increasing as its economy grows, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Netanyahu have warm relations. Bhutan is a close Indian partner and China has stepped up disputes along the kingdom’s borders.<br />One payoff for the U.S. of the Abraham Accords was the promise that they could lead to increased investment in Israeli technology from wealthy Arab states, displacing Chinese capital. If the Bhutan-Israel agreement further strengthens Israel-India ties, that also redounds to the benefit of the U.S. as it tries to balance China’s influence in Eurasia.<br />As Joe Biden begins Middle East diplomacy, he will be engaging with an Israel that is in a stronger strategic position than when he was last in the White House. He says he wants to build on the Trump Administration’s diplomatic progress between Israel and the Arab world, and a November Journal report suggests Saudi Arabia is holding out on recognizing Israel in the hope of using it to improve its standing with the Biden Administration.</td>

Throughout the pandemic, she said, she has feared bringing the virus home to an adult daughter with autism who needs her mother’s help to dress, shower and eat.<br />Michelle Mitcheson, a nurse, felt apprehension about getting a vaccine that had been authorized for emergency use but not fully approved by federal regulators, but said she would get one. “I am willing to take some degree of risk in order to do the most good for the majority of the population,” she said.<br />Physician assistant Patrick Coppler hoped to get the vaccine quickly, he said, but not before emergency responders who have less control over exposure to contagious patients.<br />The three health-care workers are among 60,000 at UPMC, the hospital system and health insurer affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh, and about 740,000 across Pennsylvania according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, who will be the first to receive the Covid-19 vaccine because of their critical jobs and risk at work. But with supply tight in first shipments, hospitals across the U.S. have been forced to decide who goes first, with plans in flux up to the final days.<br />The Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use—the first to get such a green light—late Friday, setting in motion UPMC’s push to notify individual employees who will get the opportunity to receive the earliest shots. By Monday, the first UPMC health-care workers finally had an answer to who would be offered the vaccine.</td>

      <td>Major foundations back a proposal that would force smaller donors to spend down their funds.</td>
      <td>It takes a fine sense of irony to start the season of giving by trying to limit Americans’ generosity. Yet that would be the outcome of a high-profile legislative proposal unveiled on Dec. 1, “Giving Tuesday,” conceived by former hedge-fund manager John Arnold and Boston College law professor Ray Madoff. The proposal would stifle Americans who want to support worthy causes but aren’t superrich. It would also further the goals of progressive politicians who seek to punish charitable giving they don’t like and can’t control.<br />The “Initiative to Accelerate Charitable Giving” is framed as a way to force the wealthy to give more. It enjoys the backing of some of America’s biggest and most prominent foundations, including Ford, Kresge, Kellogg and Hewlett. These large and powerful institutions are effectively trying to dictate how smaller and less influential donors give, which dovetails neatly with the goals of progressive politicians and activists.<br />The centerpiece is a series of regulations on donor-advised funds, a popular option for philanthropists outside the 1%. While the foundations supporting the initiative control a combined $38 billion, the average donor-advised fund has a little more than $166,000 set aside for charity. Donor-advised funds allow individuals to donate as much as they like annually, even a few hundred dollars. Some choose to give right away, while others take a long-term approach, waiting to align their priorities with the needs of the communities they aim to serve. These funds also provide donors with the option of privacy—the particular focus of political attack.<br />Donor-advised funds have multiplied. The number of accounts has risen by more than 300% since 2010, and as their popularity has grown, so has the criticism. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse routinely savages them, since he can’t see and therefore attack or control who gives to them. Yet the vast majority of givers are supporting critical services helping people in need, and liberals use donor-advised funds to support their favored causes too.<br />The Arnold-Madoff initiative would starve them of funding. Most notably, it encourages Congress to pass legislation that would force donor-advised funds to disburse money within 15 years or lose tax deductibility, pushing more money into the hands of tax collectors instead of charities. The 15-year marker is entirely arbitrary, and discriminatory: The foundations that back the proposal would still be able to hold their tax-advantaged funds in perpetuity. Yet donor-advised funds already have a higher payout rate than the required minimum payout for a foundation—approximately 20% compared with 5%—even though they have only a tenth of the $1 trillion managed by foundations. Donor-advised funds and private foundations alike should have the option to address the needs of communities over a longer time horizon.</td>

Banks hold half of all commercial real-estate loans.

      <td>Want better instructors at universities and colleges? Then emphasize teaching, not research, when recruiting faculty members.</td>
      <td>As the pandemic has forced most colleges and universities to adopt remote instruction, it’s worth remembering that more than 50 years ago some schools voluntarily experimented with remote instruction via televised classes. That did not go well either. Students did not feel the same connection to their instructors and that, in turn, made a difference in what was learned. “It’s better to have a poor instructor in the classroom,” said one unhappy professor in 1967, “than to have a good one on TV.”<br />The vignette comes from Jonathan Zimmerman’s “The Amateur Hour: A History of College Teaching in America.” Mr. Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania, has braided together a smooth narrative from many short pieces of thread, consisting of glimpses into the experiences of faculty members, students and administrators from the early 19th century up through the 1990s, and encompassing two- and four-year institutions, large and small, elite and not. The book is economical in its presentation of materials, gathered from 60-plus archives, and even-handed in presenting the gripes of instructors and students.<br />The book’s clever title refers to the way that higher education, when hiring, evaluating and rewarding faculty, gives most attention to research productivity and little to teaching effectiveness. Partly this is due to the difficulty of measuring effectiveness in the classroom, but it is also due to the resistance of faculty members to having their teaching reviewed by peers—something that would, Mr. Zimmerman says, “make their teaching truly professional.”<br />“The Amateur Hour” begins with the recitation model of college teaching, which was near universal in the early 1800s. Students were asked to read an assigned passage and then, at class time, recite either a summary or, some professors might insist, the passage in its entirety. When lectures began to displace recitation, some college presidents worried aloud about the problem of keeping students actively engaged throughout the class session. The Yale Report of 1828 wondered whether the student attending a lecture “may repose upon his seat and yield a passive hearing . . . without ever calling into exercise the powers of his own mind.”<br />As more students enrolled in higher education, hiring did not keep pace. Class sizes grew, and students had less contact with professors. Previously, faculty members at small liberal-arts colleges knew every student on campus and could demonstrate personal concern for them. By the late 19th century, however, many American faculty members were trained in Germany and brought back with them a passion for research, as well as more interest in libraries and laboratories than in students. In 1887, Julius Seelye, the president of Amherst College, lamented the changes: “Education is a wholly personal work. It is not gained by books, or by instruction alone, nor by anything in place of the living inspiration of the living teacher.”</td>

      <td>Will Hunter Biden wake up to a special counsel in his Christmas stocking?<br />News reports say President Trump wants his attorney general to name one. The law says a special counsel is warranted in a criminal investigation when leaving it to the Justice Department presents “a conflict of interest.” It’s hard to imagine a more unambiguous conflict of interest than the one Hunter Biden presents: A Joe Biden Justice Department investigating his son over conduct that might also implicate the sitting president.<br />Even so, a special counsel is a bad idea.<br />Two weeks ago, Mr. Barr announced that in October he’d appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham as special counsel for the investigation into the origins of the FBI’s Russia-collusion probe. He did so to ensure Mr. Durham could finish his investigation regardless of the election outcome.<br />The argument was that the magnitude and nature of the allegation—that those at the uppermost levels of the government abused their power to intervene in a U.S. election and then to undermine a duly elected president—made appointing a special counsel the lesser of evils. It’s a strong argument, and it has persuaded many who otherwise rightly regard the institution of special counsel as pernicious.</td>

The Biden Team is playing a sort of good cop, bad cop with Beijing—Jake Sullivan urges Americans to support Australia against Chinese pressure as John Kerry muses about grand climate deals with Beijing. But a mixed-signal strategy at this stage is, if anything, beneficial to Team Biden. It’s the new administration’s potential for later fuzzy thinking when it comes to great power rivals such as China that should worry onlookers.<br />Sending mixed signals is a standard diplomatic technique. Iran has been using a good cop, bad cop strategy against the U.S. for decades, and it has paid off pretty well. There’s no reason an American president shouldn’t give it a try.<br />True, Beijing doesn’t appear to be seeking relationship resets: China is behaving aggressively toward India, Australia and others. Confrontational Chinese “wolf warrior diplomats” continue to be prominent. Still, the Trump years have been a wild ride, and giving Beijing a chance to decide whether it wants to deal with the good or bad cops in the Biden administration will at least clarify U.S. choices.<br />But while a good cop, bad cop routine in December 2020 won’t derail the new team, failing to deal effectively with the challenge a rising China poses to America and its Indo-Pacific allies could.<br />Though there is much to criticize about the Trump administration, its members understood that without geopolitical success it doesn’t really matter what Americans think about climate change, human rights or the politics of gender.

The day it came out  CD Projekt  said the game had eight million preorders, of which about 59%, or 4.7 million copies, were for PCs.<br />A spokeswoman for  CD Projekt  declined to comment further. CD Projekt shares are down about 25% since Wednesday’s close in Warsaw trading, shedding more than $2 billion of market value.</td>

It has led to 15 convictions so far and some union members say the charges and indictments have dented trust in the UAW’s leadership.<br />The proposed settlement includes a six-year period of independent oversight by a court-appointed monitor and requires the UAW to pay $1.5 million to resolve outstanding tax issues, U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider said at a press conference on Monday.<br />The UAW has also agreed to hold a referendum among the rank-and-file to potentially change the way it elects top leadership, an effort aimed at giving members more influence over who runs the union.<br />The federal investigation, which first became public in 2017, is one of the largest into a national labor union in decades and has led to the convictions, including two former UAW presidents.</td>

Because while he’s been embraced by the broader listening public, there’s an unusual intensity to the connection he has with his most devoted fans. The strength of that bond owes a lot to his willingness to make his emotional travails the focal point of his work. Beginning with his 2009 debut album, “Man on the Moon: The End of Day,” Kid Cudi has portrayed himself as an artist of rare vulnerability. His persona, that of a depressed and lonely man self-medicating with potent marijuana and other intoxicants, appealed to the listeners who shared his anxiety.<br />Besides his bond with his audience, Mr. Mescudi’s cult status owes something to his wild inconsistency. His artistic gifts include melody—he sings and raps—and a sharp ear for production, but his writing can be dull on a line-by-line basis and he has trouble assembling coherent album-length statements. In addition he sometimes follows his muse down blind alleys—he’s indulged his fondness for grungy alternative rock in both a misfired side project (the 2012 self-titled record from his duo WZRD) and a dreadful and unbearably long release under his own name, 2015’s “Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven.” His just-released seventh LP, “Man on the Moon III: The Chosen” (Republic), avoids these fatal pitfalls and is one of his most engaging albums from end to end.</td>

This turquoise blouse, a collaboration between actress Catherine Deneuve and French label A.P.C., will stand out on even the blurriest of office-issued-laptop screens. The shirt is part of Ms. Deneuve’s vintage-inspired capsule collection for A.P.C., which also includes a mod skirt, block heels, wool sweaters and other classics with a distinctly Parisiantwist.<br />Ms. Deneuve, 77, is well versed in style—after all, the French actress was dressed by Yves Saint Laurent himself for her starring role in the racy 1967 film “Belle de Jour.” “She was 100% confident in her [design] choices,” said A.P.C. founder Jean Touitou. Most pieces in the mini-collection are named for one of Ms. Deneuve’s on-screen roles. This blouse was christened Séverine after the sultry heroine of “Belle de Jour.”<br />Subtle and flirty, the silk-twill top nods to the character’s coquettish charm, but its gently frilled placket is not nearly as exaggerated as the OTT blouses so abundant this winter.<br />An allover paisley pattern—“the standard print of the 1960s,” according to Mr. Touitou—lends the garment a retro flavor. But the Séverine is no relic—the boxy cut is markedly modern and comfortable, making this button-down a compelling choice for today’s WFH lifestyle.<br />The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.

Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin spoke on Sunday.<br />Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have sought to pass another relief bill after months of gridlock and as the pandemic’s resurgence has strained hospitals and generated new business restrictions.

      <td>Museums and memorials wowed this year, but, in a socially distanced world, designers are rethinking their approach to built spaces.</td>
      <td>Who could know in October 1929 that the architecture of Jazz Age America was dead, along with the world that created it? After the shock of the Great Crash, sensations like the Chrysler Building looked frivolous and bombastic. In a few years it was clear that people no longer demanded architectural sensations but serious buildings that addressed serious problems, particularly housing.<br />Likewise today; no one can yet predict what the coronavirus pandemic, the ensuing lockdown, the continuing health and safety protocols, as well as the general and lingering feeling of anxiety will mean for our buildings and infrastructure. But it is clear that these things have already brought about a radical reset. It is no longer enough for architects and those of us in the media who cover them to think of “architecture” primarily in terms of the latest eye-catching sensation. Suddenly larger issues are in play, such as the future of the workplace, dealing with the “mass” in mass transit, and even the fate of the city itself.<br />As a result, the buildings completed this year, all designed before the pandemic, already seem the products of a different, more innocent world. Of several distinguished buildings of the arts, the most ambitious is the Kinder Building for the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, which was designed by Stephen Holl Architects and opened Nov. 21. Its geometry is intriguing: Deep notches are cut all along its perimeter, opening it up to the street and prefacing each of its five public entrances with its own elegant forecourt. Above the roof line, the geometry abruptly turns curvilinear in a way meant to evoke the spacious Texas sky (“concave curves, imagined from cloud circles,” as Mr. Holl puts it). Like his groundbreaking Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City, Mo., it also encloses its physical structure with a luminous skin, and at night it glows from within like a box of trapped sunlight.<br />Mr. Holl’s translucent walls are a particularly handsome example of that contemporary architectural feature known as the rain screen. This is the array of panels mounted a few inches in front of a building’s high-tech skin, which acts as an umbrella held sideways, letting any water that trickles through fall safely away in the cavity behind. If Mr. Holl’s building presents a pleated scrim of glass columns, a different approach is offered by the new Oklahoma Contemporary Arts Center, in Oklahoma City, by Rand Elliott Architects. Its rain screen is composed of vertical aluminum fins, set at irregular angles so their light changes and fluctuates as the sun moves, much as a beaded curtain rustles in the wind. The Arts Center had the misfortune to open this past March and then promptly shut its doors, just as the great national lockdown began.<br />Subsequent events have given new significance to familiar things. Just as “Hamlet” seems different after Freud, so buildings seem different after Covid-19. SelgasCano’s Second Home Hollywood in Los Angeles was noted in this space last year as a new kind of flexible office for “nomadic” freelancers and flex-time workers. Then its glass-walled pods and lush tropical plantings seemed merely clever; now they seem visionary. Fresh air is brought into its pods directly, freeing them from the recirculated air of an HVAC system. A dozen firms have already moved in.</td>

Progressive politicians at the local and national levels cynically seized on repeated crises to promote their ideological objectives. Most of the nation’s celebrated newsrooms abandoned the last pretense of objectivity and revealed their selective use and manipulation of facts as little more than propaganda.<br />There are exceptions, but depressingly few to celebrate. The most notable last holdouts to this encroaching empire of dishonesty are the millions of decent and honorable Americans who have suffered unprecedented human and economic damage this year, even as their comfortably distanced, self-aggrandizing superiors lecture them on their ignorance and inadequacy. Lions led by donkeys.<br />Two episodes last week stand as fitting codas to this spectacle, timely examples of the moral corruption eating away at American institutions.</td>

      <td>The gym chain has survived in a disastrous year for competitors, but investors seem unaware that the pandemic has seriously dented its business prospects</td>
      <td>Planet Fitness Inc.  kicked off 2020 by announcing that it would sponsor the television show “The Biggest Loser.” Little did it know that Covid-19 would soon make that an apt label for itself—a crash diet that left its market value 70% lighter in less than a month.<br />Yet, while many large and small competitors were pushed into bankruptcy by the pandemic, Planet Fitness somehow gained all the weight back, and then some. Its shares on Monday morning were trading 8% higher than a year ago. That makes no sense.<br />Planet Fitness has a clever business model that has helped it grow rapidly, but certain elements of it backfired recently. Charging very little and deliberately making it difficult to cancel, its best customers rarely show up but keep paying anyway. Its gyms couldn’t fit them all at once if they did. Even so, turnover is high enough to require constant recruitment of new members by its mostly franchisee-owned stores.<br />The company made an apparent tactical error by drafting dues from members in March even as lockdown orders shut down all their U.S. gyms. Cancellations had to be in person or by letter even as gyms were closed, and members wary of unnecessary trips still can’t do so online or by phone even with gyms reopened. That infuriated those forced to move or who were financially pinched, judging by social-media posts. Membership went from 15.5 million in March to just 14 million at the end of October. The move also artificially flattered third-quarter results reported last month since those monthly revenues were credited for future use and were deferred until gyms reopened.<br />While overall revenue fell by 37% year over year, equipment revenue, the lucrative business of outfitting and periodically refurbishing franchised gyms, tumbled by 71%. The company was forced to offer a discount of 15% on equipment to support new store openings and it gave franchisees a 12-month extension on “development requirements.” Growth in new gyms has, not surprisingly, fallen far short of expectations. Planet Fitness ended the quarter at about one-third of its original 2020 store-growth target and has suspended financial guidance.</td>

      <td>Nearly 15 years after acquiring the U.S. brand and trying to revamp it, Adidas says it might sell it</td>
      <td>BERLIN— Adidas AG  Monday said it was reviewing the future of Reebok and might sell the U.S. fitness brand—a business it had spent years trying to revamp and that could now fetch several billion dollars, according to analysts.<br />Adidas said a sale was one of the options it was considering as part of a five-year strategy plan it is set to present March 10, 2021. It may also decide to keep the business, the German sports retail group said.<br />Adidas, the world’s second-largest sportswear maker after  Nike Inc.,  bought Reebok in 2006 for roughly €3 billion, equivalent to $3.6 billion, as part of a bid to expand in the U.S. and challenge its bigger rival on its home turf. Reebok at the time was a sponsor of the National Basketball Association. But the plan has disappointed, analysts say.<br />Adidas managed to improve the Reebok business but sales have lagged behind those of Adidas itself and dragged down the group’s profits. In 2016, Adidas Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted launched a turnaround plan for Reebok shortly after taking on the job. He cut costs by closing down dozens of Reebok stores in the U.S. and aimed to make the unit’s management more independent from Adidas.<br />Mr. Rorsted repeatedly opposed calls from some shareholders to ditch Reebok, arguing that the revamp, not a sale, was the answer.</td>

      <td>Antimalarials seemed promising, then failed in trials. That’s how it’s supposed to work.</td>
      <td>Politics has infected many issues over the past four years and has now reached the supposedly objective halls of official medicine. In an editorial for the Journal of the American Medical Association, “Misguided Use of Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19: The Infusion of Politics Into Science,” Dr. Michael Saag claims that “the politicization of the treatment” was more important than the science in promoting the use of the antimalaria drug to treat Covid-19. This evidence-free claim is contradicted by information in the same editorial and the scientific literature.<br />Dr. Saag doesn’t cite a single source to support his claim that President Trump’s April 4 promotion of the drug influenced physicians’ prescribing decisions. His claim that “no health official” in the U.S. government endorsed use of hydroxychloroquine is contradicted in his next sentence, which notes that the Food and Drug Administration approved an emergency-use authorization for hydroxychloroquine on March 28, one week before Mr. Trump’s comments. The FDA granted that authorization at the request of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or Barda, another U.S. government health agency.<br />Physicians prescribed hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 because they had reason to believe it could work. In the early days of the pandemic when there were no established therapies, clinicians noted the severe immune response that the SARS-CoV-2 virus elicited in severely ill patients. They began to deploy hydroxychloroquine because it has long been used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, with a good safety profile.<br />Hydroxychloroquine and its cousin chloroquine had also been studied as antivirals with activity against the similar SARS coronavirus and other viruses. Several encouraging preclinical studies and small clinical trials, including a French study published in March and cited by Dr. Saag, reinforced physicians’ willingness to try hydroxychloroquine.<br />Within a short time, well-conducted clinical trials failed to confirm the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent Covid-19. This is the way medical science is supposed to work. Treatments for new diseases are tried based on a theory and then abandoned when trials fail to confirm their usefulness.</td>

      <td>LONDON—British doctors say rolling out the  Pfizer Inc. -BioNTech SE Covid-19 vaccine beyond hospitals will take longer than anticipated because of logistical challenges and complications thrown up by news in the U.K. of allergic reactions after the injection.<br />Following two severe allergic reactions on Dec. 8, the first day of the U.K. vaccination campaign last week, doctors were told to monitor patients for 15 minutes after each injection.<br />Logistical hiccups and the additional time required to monitor patients after a shot have added friction to an already-cumbersome immunization program and could signal challenges to come for the U.S. as health officials start vaccinating patients there.<br />Extra time required for observation means some U.K. doctors’ offices pulled out of the local vaccination campaign before it started Monday because they don’t have enough space to accommodate people in a socially distanced manner and still deliver the expected number of doses.<br />“You don’t necessarily get through as many people because you’ve got the 15 minutes” waiting time, said Ruth Rankine, primary care director at the NHS Confederation, the membership body representing health-care staff in the U.K.’s state-run National Health Service. Each shot takes around eight minutes to administer, according to NHS exercises in preparation for the vaccine.</td>
