      <td>President-elect Joe Biden has a stronger shot at advancing his legislative agenda through a divided Senate after two runoff victories in Georgia gave Democrats control of the chamber.<br />Democrat Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff won Senate seats in Tuesday’s runoff elections, giving each party 50 Senate seats at the start of Mr. Biden’s presidency. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris could break any tie.<br />That gives Democrats control of both the House and Senate and elevates Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) to majority leader for the first time in his career. The incoming president will be positioned to push for a more ambitious spending package aimed at taming the coronavirus pandemic and bolstering the economy, two central themes of his 2020 campaign against President Trump. And he will be more likely to see his chosen cabinet members confirmed quickly.<br />Mr. Biden said in a statement that the Georgia results showed that voters wanted action on an array of issues and that he remained committed to working with Republicans to find consensus.<br />“After the past four years, after the election, and after today’s election certification proceedings on the Hill, it’s time to turn the page,” Mr. Biden said. “The American people demand action and they want unity. I am more optimistic than I ever have been that we can deliver both.”</td>

Thousands of protesters surrounded the Capitol on all sides, and some climbed up the outside walls.<br />The police presence appeared to be minimal, though there were some police in riot gear on the east side of the Capitol by the Senate entrance.<br />Protesters chanted “Take the building!” and “Stop the steal!”—a popular refrain as Mr. Trump’s supporters challenged the results of  the November presidential election.<br />The protest took place as Congress was set to ratify President-elect Biden’s Electoral College win.</td>

      <td>After Democrats won both Georgia runoff races, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be able to break ties as needed</td>
      <td>With Democrats winning both Senate seats in Georgia, the chamber will have a balance of 50-50, enough for their party to secure control there for the first time in six years. With President-elect Joe Biden set to be inaugurated on Jan. 20, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will then become the tiebreaking vote in the Senate.<br />Here are some questions and answers about the implications of a split Senate.<br />Yes, but not frequently. The last time the chamber was evenly split between the two parties was in 2001. Republican leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota cut a power-sharing deal that divided the committees and their resources evenly. Because Republican Vice President Dick Cheney could still break a tie, Republicans had control.<br />That 50-50 split didn’t last long, though. Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party in June of that year to become an independent and caucus with Democrats. Republicans won the majority back in the 2002 elections.<br />The party in Senate control decides what comes to the floor for a vote. A Democratic majority means that Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), the expected leader, will be able to control what legislation is given priority and what proposals are blocked. It also allows for more coordination with the Democratic-led House and the new Democratic White House.</td>

      <td>The pandemic recession has thrown up roadblocks for most of the nation’s largest banks. Not so for  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.<br />The Wall Street giant’s share price closed at a record for the first time in nearly three years, a sign of how much the bank has profited from the financial chaos of the past year. Its stock has risen about 19% over the past month, far more than any of its five big-bank peers.<br />Goldman shares had been static for years, a perpetual concern for Chief Executive David Solomon and one that led him to peel back some of the bank’s famous secrecy a year ago. At the time, its trading business was languishing amid efforts to build a consumer bank and grow its wealth-management business.<br />The pandemic pushed many of those challenges aside. It spurred roller-coaster markets that lifted its traditional sales-and-trading business. Then, as markets bounced back, its bankers made money helping corporate clients sell debt and equity.<br />The investment-banking business probably stayed strong in the last three months of the year.  Jefferies Financial Group Inc.  said late Monday that its investment-banking revenue hit a record in the fourth quarter, which analysts see as a favorable sign for larger competitors such as Goldman.</td>

      <td>Victory comes hours after Democrat Warnock was declared winner in the Senate race against Republican Loeffler</td>
      <td>ATLANTA—Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff defeated Republican David Perdue for a seat in the U.S. Senate, where he will join fellow newly elected Democrat Raphael Warnock and give their party control of the chamber.<br />The Associated Press declared both men had won their races on Wednesday. The two upset victories give Democrats control of both the Senate and the House for the first time in a decade.<br />Mr. Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, beat Mr. Perdue, who was first elected senator in 2014. Mr. Perdue’s term expired on Sunday. Mr. Warnock, the pastor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s former church, defeated Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the AP projected earlier Wednesday. Ms. Loeffler was appointed a year ago to fill the seat of GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned for health reasons.<br />Messrs. Ossoff and Warnock, who will be sworn in within weeks, will be the first Democrats to represent Georgia in the Senate since 2005. The change of power in the Senate will hand Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration a Congress more willing to consider its agenda. That includes confirming Mr. Biden’s judicial nominees and cabinet appointees to seeking additional federal spending in response to the Covid-19 pandemic—items that were central to Messrs. Ossoff and Warnock’s campaigns.<br />Once the Georgia senators-elect are sworn in, Democrats and Republicans will each hold 50 seats in the Senate. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast tiebreaking votes.</td>

Minutes of the Fed’s Dec. 15-16 policy meeting indicated officials saw a high bar for dialing up that support by increasing the amount or changing the composition of those purchases.<br />“Participants generally judged that the asset purchase program as structured was providing very significant policy accommodation,” according to the minutes, which were released Wednesday.<br />The minutes also indicated that many officials were nervous about the potential for growth to stall in the winter amid a surge in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. But they also thought newly approved vaccines had reduced the chance of worse-than-anticipated economic outcomes later in 2021.<br />“A number of participants saw risks to economic activity as more balanced than earlier,” the minutes said.</td>

On Tuesday, prosecutors painted a much different picture when they explained their decision not to bring charges against Officer Rusten Sheskey, who is white, or Mr. Blake, who is Black.<br />The video shows Mr. Blake in a scuffle with police behind the car, then walking around to the front with officers trailing him, guns drawn. They can be heard ordering him to “drop the knife,” repeatedly, but it isn’t clear in the video whether Mr. Blake is holding a blade.<br />It then shows Mr. Blake opening the driver’s side door, and starting to get into the car, as an officer grabs his tank top and then fires multiple shots toward his back.<br />Prosecutors showed an enhanced video clip at a press briefing on Tuesday in which a dark object can be seen in a few frames in Mr. Blake’s hand. They said the shape matches that of the razorblade type knife found on the floorboards of the car. They also said Mr. Blake admitted to having the knife in his possession and switching it from his left hand to his right so he could open the door.</td>

      <td>Republicans lost one Senate seat in Georgia on Tuesday, and as we write they appear fated to lose a second and control of the Upper Chamber. You don’t have to be Karl Rove to understand what happened.<br />If you want to win, don’t tell voters that their votes don’t matter. Don’t have a President tell his voters that the last election was stolen, that Georgia Republicans were complicit in the theft, that GOP Senate leaders don't care, and then expect those same voters to turn out in the Senate runoffs after a rally and a few tweets.<br />Donald Trump cost Republicans the Senate by making the two Georgia runoffs a referendum on himself. The races should have been a referendum on blocking Democrats from controlling all of Congress and the executive branch. But that message was obscured, if not obliterated, by Mr. Trump’s insistence on telling voters day after day that he was cheated in November—no matter the lack of credible evidence or plausible path to victory.<br />The Georgia election details prove this point. Turnout was down from November as expected in most places. But it was down more in Trump areas than in Democratic strongholds. The suburban voters who rejected Mr. Trump in November also didn’t return to support GOP incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.<br />Neither Republican was a strong candidate, but in November Mr. Perdue beat Democrat Jon Ossoff by some 88,000 votes and nearly avoided a runoff. This time he’s losing by about 17,500. Mr. Ossoff won 54% of suburban Cobb County’s vote against Mr. Perdue in November but 55.8% on Tuesday. In Gwinnett County, also in the Atlanta suburbs, Mr. Ossoff won 56.8% in November but 59.9% this time. Those two counties were GOP strongholds not long ago.</td>

      <td>The widely respected jurist, whose Supreme Court nomination was blocked by Republicans in 2016, will be tasked with steadying the Justice Department</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden intends to nominate Merrick Garland as attorney general, selecting a widely respected jurist and experienced prosecutor to steady a Justice Department rocked by years of political storms, people familiar with the matter said.<br />Judge Garland, a 1997 appointee of President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, rose to the top of the list in recent weeks. His selection became definite as Mr. Biden’s team grew increasingly optimistic about Democrats’ chances of taking the two Senate seats in Tuesday’s Georgia’s runoff election, giving them the ability to replace Mr. Garland’s seat on the appeals court without concerns that Republicans would block whomever Mr. Biden chooses.<br />Mr. Biden also intends to nominate longtime national security official Lisa Monaco as deputy attorney general, and Vanita Gupta, who was head of the Justice Department’s civil-rights division under President Barack Obama, as the Department’s No. 3, officials on his transition team said. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, will be named head of the civil-rights division, the transition officials said, in a move that will likely please advocates who have urged Mr. Biden to make diversity and racial justice priorities at the Justice Department.<br />Mr. Garland isn’t close to the Biden family—a fact that transition officials consider an asset given that the Justice Department is investigating the tax and business dealings of Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter. Mr. Garland’s supporters say his decision-making in the case likely would be viewed as independent of the president’s personal interests.<br />A Biden transition official pointed to Mr. Garland’s strong reputation as a judge and his record of being impartial and avoiding any appearances of conflict of interest. The official said Mr. Garland has the “highest level of integrity and independence.”</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Hong Kong activists say this week’s mass roundup shows that Beijing’s tolerance for democracy in the city is quickly narrowing, by branding dozens of opposition lawmakers who participated in political primaries as suspects in a plot to paralyze the city.<br />On Wednesday, about 1,000 police officers carried out predawn arrests of 53 people suspected of subversion for their involvement in political races held by opposition parties last summer to identify candidates for an election that had been scheduled for September. Six were arrested for organizing and planning the races and 47 for their participation.<br />“This is such a wide net authorities have cast on the pro-democracy camp. Everyone was involved in those primary elections,” said Lee Cheuk-yan, vice chairman of the Labour Party, which had one candidate arrested, Carol Ng. “What road does this lead us down? Who will dare stand for elections again?”<br />The scale of the operation stunned a pro-democracy movement that was already demoralized and expecting further arrests. Officers fanned out across the city starting at around 6 a.m., knocking on doors, confiscating electronics and bringing people into police stations.<br />Among those arrested was an American lawyer in his 70s, John Clancey, who could be seen in a video posted on social media leaning on a cane as he was led to a police van. Others included veteran lawmakers and young political hopefuls who had been aiming to enter the legislature last year for the first time.</td>

Read John Jurgensen’s dive into season 3 of “Cobra Kai” here.<br />Here’s what else is streaming this week:<br />Discovery+, a new subscription streaming service from Discovery, Inc., that launched this week, brings the worlds of Food Network, TLC, HGTV, Animal Planet and other networks and brands, into one universe the way Disney+ consolidated Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel into a single hub at the end of 2019. And much like the way Disney+ has mined franchises like Star Wars for new series like “The Mandalorian,” Discovery+ is digging into some of its most bankable franchises for spin-off series. TLC’s “90 Day Fiancé” for example, already has four spin-offs, including “90 Day Bares All,”“90 Day Diaries,” and “90 Day Journey.”<br />Lisa Holme, a senior vice president at Discovery who leads programming and partnerships for Discovery+, says the service is looking beyond giving its audience more from “Property Brothers,” Bobby Flay, “House Hunters” and Mike Rowe. It also is offering similar content in familiar genres that wouldn’t necessarily air on Discovery’s networks, such as the documentary series “Judi Dench’s Wild Borneo Adventure.” She’s also bullish on the service’s ability to create the next generation of authorities in the food space, authorities in the home space. ”Can we find and create the next Martha Stewart?”</td>

      <td>Vaccines may be less effective against the variant that has come to dominate in South Africa, but are expected to have some benefit</td>
      <td>JOHANNESBURG—A new variant of the coronavirus that is surging across South Africa may make the existing Covid-19 vaccines less effective, but is unlikely to be totally resistant to the shots, according to leading researchers who have studied the mutations and the vaccines.<br />The variant, which has already shown up in patients in Europe and other African countries, has quickly become the predominant one in South Africa, exacerbating a second wave of infections that is overwhelming hospitals and has driven daily deaths to record highs.<br />South African researchers are racing to determine whether it makes patients more seriously ill than other variants of the virus. They are also testing how it responds to antibodies from people who have recovered from Covid-19 and those who have received coronavirus vaccines.<br />Their official conclusions are eagerly awaited by researchers around the globe, since one of the variant’s mutations has in earlier laboratory experiments shown increased resistance to some of the antibodies the body uses to fight off Covid-19. U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier this week that he was “incredibly worried about the South African variant.”<br />But scientists who worked on the antibody experiments and the lead investigators of several vaccine trials being conducted in South Africa say that—based on their understanding of the virus and the immune response triggered by the shots—the immunizations should still work against the new variant, although perhaps not as effectively.</td>

      <td>New guidance from Treasury Department spurs exchange to delist shares to comply with Trump executive order</td>
      <td>The New York Stock Exchange will move forward with delisting three Chinese telecommunications companies targeted by an executive order from President Trump, reversing course yet again after the NYSE said earlier this week that it wouldn’t delist them.<br />The NYSE said Wednesday that trading of the U.S.-listed shares of  China Mobile Ltd. ,  China Telecom Corp.  and  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.  would be suspended at 4 a.m. ET on Monday. Mr. Trump’s order seeks to ban trading in securities of companies that the administration says have links to the Chinese military.<br />The NYSE said its latest action came after it received “new specific guidance” from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on Tuesday, which listed the three companies’ American depositary receipts as being covered by Mr. Trump’s order.<br />Wednesday’s reversal is likely to raise further questions about the exchange’s handling of the three Chinese stocks. Last week, the NYSE said it would delist the three companies to comply with Mr. Trump’s order, only to reverse course on Monday and say that it wasn’t delisting them.<br />A person familiar with the matter said the NYSE backtracked Monday due to ambiguity in whether the three companies were covered by the order, but the new guidance, which Treasury shared with the exchange late Tuesday, made it clear that the companies must be delisted. The Treasury posted that guidance online Wednesday morning.</td>

      <td>Whether investors one day regret paying so much for  Tesla Inc.  stock, they have done the planet a favor. Their enthusiasm enabled the company to raise enough money to stay afloat until it could profitably mass produce electric cars while accelerating other manufacturers’ rollouts.<br />Tesla, trading at more than 1,000 times trailing earnings, is only the most extreme example of a euphoria that has swept green energy. From the end of 2019 through Tuesday, a fund that tracks a Nasdaq clean energy index had risen 191% compared with the broad market’s 15%. It trades at 52 times trailing earnings, nearly double the overall market’s already-historically high multiple. More than a third of its 44 constituents are losing money. On Wednesday afternoon it was up 7% on expectations Democratic control of the Senate would lead to more support for renewable energy.<br />“The bubble in renewables is probably the stupidest that I have seen in my career,” Charles Gave, chairman of money manager and research firm Gavekal, wrote last month.<br />Stupid, however, isn’t the same as useless. Some bubbles can be hugely destructive, as we saw with housing 13 years ago. Others are socially useful. Private markets generally provide too little incentive for risky innovation because shareholders only capture a small part of an innovation’s benefit; most goes to consumers (think of a life-saving drug). A bubble can overcome that market failure as investors shower capital on countless new ventures they hope will be the next  Microsoft Corp.  or  Amgen Inc.  Even as most of those ventures fail, they extend the technological frontier.<br />In the late 1990s and early 2000s, investors snapped up the stocks and bonds of money-losing technology, media and telecom companies. The mania financed a glut of fiber optic that drove the price of bandwidth down enough to bankrupt many telecom companies while allowing countless new businesses to emerge. It also enabled  Amazon.com Inc.  to raise enough money to keep growing until it had proven its business model could work.</td>

But there is no evidence of such problems on a scale large enough to reverse Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s win.<br />Here are some of the claims about alleged irregularities in five key states and election officials’ responses. Mr. Trump’s campaign and its allies have lost dozens of lawsuits seeking to challenge the results.<br />Mr. Trump and his supporters have alleged widespread irregularities in Arizona’s election. Mr. Biden won the battleground state by 10,457 votes, according to the certified result. Audits in Arizona’s four most populous counties found no evidence of widespread discrepancies, according to reports released by the Arizona secretary of state’s office.<br />In November, Arizona’s election was the target of claims questioning whether votes made with Sharpie pens would be counted. Government officials debunked the theory. “If you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie),” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, said in a  Facebook  post.<br />Georgia uses voting machines provided by Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems Corp. Mr. Trump said on Twitter after the Nov. 3 vote that Dominion’s equipment is “not good or secure,” and he and his allies have repeatedly questioned the accuracy of those machines.</td>

      <td>U.S. officials are considering prohibiting Americans from investing in  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  and  Tencent Holdings Ltd. , said people familiar with the matter.<br />In recent weeks, State Department and Department of Defense officials have held conversations on expanding a blacklist of companies that are prohibited to U.S. investments because of claimed ties to China’s military and security services. The U.S. government announced its original blacklist in November with 31 companies.<br />The departments have debated with the Treasury Department over whether adding these firms could have wide capital-markets ramifications, the people said. The plan is still under deliberation and may not go through as agencies debate its impact on markets, the people added.<br />Tencent and Alibaba are China’s two most-valuable publicly listed companies with a combined market capitalization of over $1.3 trillion, and their shares are held by scores of U.S. mutual funds and other investors. If enacted, the move would be a major escalation by the exiting Trump administration on its efforts to unwind U.S. investors’ holdings in major Chinese companies.<br />The Trump administration has stepped up efforts to sanction Chinese companies in its final days. On Wednesday, the New York Stock Exchange said it will move ahead to delist China’s three biggest telecommunication carriers, backtracking an earlier decision to scrap the plan after receiving “new specific guidance” from the Treasury Department.</td>

      <td>The Trump administration made it easier for businesses to classify workers as independent contractors, a victory for gig-economy companies such as food-delivery and ride-sharing services and a counter to a California law that did the opposite.<br />The Labor Department in a final rule released on Wednesday would make it more difficult for a gig worker, such as an Uber or  DoorDash  driver, to be counted as an employee under federal law. That means those workers wouldn’t be covered by federal minimum-wage and overtime laws, and they could be responsible for paying the employer portion of Social Security taxes.<br />The rule won’t go into effect until March 8, after President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. The Biden administration could seek to delay implementing the rule, give new enforcement guidance or seek to write a new version of the rule. The Biden administration could also opt to not defend the regulation should it be challenged in court. A spokeswoman for Mr. Biden declined to comment.<br />Flexible work is overwhelmingly preferred by those who choose to earn on gig-economy platforms such as Uber, Danielle Burr,  Uber Technologies Inc.’s  head of federal affairs, said Wednesday.<br />“Forcing a binary choice upon workers—to either be an employee with more benefits but with less flexibility, or an independent contractor with limited protections—is outdated,” she said, noting Uber has offered additional benefits to drivers. “We appreciate the efforts made to modernize our nation’s laws.”</td>

      <td>Trial lawyers are eager to sue businesses for scanning foreheads and letting older employees work from home.</td>
      <td>Businesses are doing all they can to keep operating while minimizing the spread of the virus. But some have run into an unexpected obstacle: federal law.<br />In May, as the first wave of the pandemic receded, Connecticut put out guidelines for workplace reopening. “Individuals over the age of 65 or with other health conditions should not visit offices, but instead continue to stay home and stay safe.” That seemed like a sound directive, but as lawyers soon pointed out, the state had told its private employers to violate federal law. The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act makes it unlawful to deprive older employees of any opportunity offered to younger colleagues.<br />You might think being assigned to work from home at full salary doesn’t count as being deprived of an opportunity, but trial lawyers have been known to argue otherwise. An at-home employee might have fewer promotion opportunities or benefit from less mentoring. Someone could try for a class action.<br />That isn’t an isolated example. For some employers a reopening plan might include using antibody tests to identify which employees had Covid and recovered; given likely immunity, those persons could be a good bet for jobs where personal contact is unavoidable. But June guidelines from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission count antibody testing as a breach of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The commission says tests for current infection are OK.<br />What about vaccination before coming back to work? The EEOC recently said it thinks employers are free to require Covid vaccination in most situations. But some employees will demand to be excused under religious or disability accommodation, and that can get chancy and expensive. In 2018 the EEOC extracted a $75,000 settlement from a Tennessee hospital that had refused to grant an employee a religious exception from its mandatory flu shot policy.</td>

      <td>Huawei is no longer set to dominate telecom networks.</td>
      <td>One of the Trump administration’s major foreign policy initiatives has gone largely unnoticed. You probably heard that the president left the Paris climate accords and Iran nuclear deal, launched a trade war, ordered the killing of Iran’s Gen. Qassem Solemaini, moved a U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and presided over peace agreements between Israel and several former Arab enemies. But you may have missed the Clean Network initiative.<br />In early 2020, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged friends and allies not to include any high-risk (read: Chinese) vendors in their 5G networks. Many countries, including the U.K., had already decided to use Huawei over rivals  Ericsson  and  Nokia .  In February, senior Huawei executive Ryan Ding announced that the company had secured 91 5G commercial contracts, 47 of them in Europe. The Clean Network plan seemed doomed to fail.<br />Then Covid-19 struck. The Chinese obfuscated the virus’s origins and attempted to sow division in the West by supplying personal protective equipment to some but not to others. Western governments began to see Beijing in a different light.<br />Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, began pleading with friendly countries to ditch their Chinese plans. He found allies among congressional Democrats. “Nations cannot cede our telecommunication infrastructure to China for financial expediency,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi told a conference in February. A couple of weeks later, a bipartisan group of senators led by Chuck Schumer and Ben Sasse urged the U.K. to reverse its 5G decision.<br />At the end of 2020, the global 5G situation looked radically different than it had at the start of the year. Britain had reversed course, banning Huawei from its 5G network. The Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Sweden all opted not to use Chinese suppliers. The Italian government, long a top target of Chinese charm offensives, had banned a top telecom firm from using Huawei. And last month Germany, often considered soft on China, passed a law that allows the government to block telecom firms’ deals with Huawei on national security grounds. Global telecom firms from  AT&T  to  Telefónica  have joined Clean Network too, vowing not to use Chinese components.</td>

The deal calls for AmerisourceBergen to pay about $6.3 billion in cash for the assets and two million of its shares, the companies said Wednesday.<br />Walgreens said the sale would allow it to better concentrate on pharmacies in its stores and on expanding health offerings. Last year, the company said it struck a deal to invest in and work with VillageMD to open hundreds of clinics with primary-care doctors at Walgreens sites across the U.S. over the next five years.<br />CVS has also pushed to bulk up its health-care services, buying insurer Aetna and developing health hubs for its stores. The company doesn’t have a wholesale operation but instead focuses on managing pharmacy benefits, running retail stores and providing health insurance.<br />Both chains are seeking to give patients more reasons to visit their locations as Amazon pushes into the prescription-drug business.

Students of politics had an easy explanation: Republicans favor Wall Street, while Silicon Valley is a progressive bastion.<br />Easy, but wrong, as the Georgia Senate vote showed. The investor response to the Georgia vote (yet to be final, but interpreted by prediction markets as a sure thing for the Democrats) was to buy banks and sell Big Tech.<br />Sure, politics has shifted, and  Facebook  and  Amazon  are now treated as baddies by many on the left. The possibility of higher capital-gains taxes should hit stocks that have left investors sitting on fat unrealized profits, too.</td>

During the pandemic, families have been reluctant to send relatives to nursing homes, which have been linked to more than 115,000 deaths.<br />“Based on feedback from our field teams, we’ve encountered more vaccine hesitancy among staff when compared with residents,” a CVS spokesman said. Facilities are also staggering dosing to staff because of potential side effects, which has extended the process.<br />The pharmacy giant said it is still on track to reach federal goals to deliver first doses at about 8,000 skilled-nursing facilities by Jan. 25.  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  said Wednesday that it also expects to complete the administration of the first doses in skilled-nursing facilities by Jan. 25.<br />CVS and Walgreens said they are also preparing to provide vaccinations to the general public by appointment at their drugstores once they become available for mass distribution later this year.

      <td>Johnny Lawrence was supposed to be left in the 1980s with a kick to the face at the end of “The Karate Kid.” Instead, the movie’s former teen villain is one of the biggest things on television at the center of “Cobra Kai,” a streaming series that carries on the “Karate Kid” tale with a mix of satire and sincerity.<br />“Cobra Kai” vaulted to No. 1 on  Netflix ’s  internal Top 10 chart with the Jan. 1 release of its third season. After “Cobra Kai” first hit Netflix last August, it spent two weeks as the most-watched TV series on major streaming platforms, and spent five weeks total in the top 10, according to Nielsen. Sony Pictures Television, which produces the show, says “Cobra Kai” draws a balance of young and older viewers that is rare among today’s diffuse TV audiences.<br />Johnny is an unlikely character to unite the masses in 2021. The fictional beer-swilling sensei is clueless about computers and social media. He’s more interested in Ratt and other ancient rock bands than the shifting social norms that rendered much of his vocabulary obsolete, including an offensive word for coward. The p-word is Johnny’s go-to descriptor for wimpy trainees, light beer, and even the unresponsive legs of a star pupil who got paralyzed in a high-school “karate riot.”<br />“People get to live vicariously through Johnny’s ignorance of the times. That’s what’s endearing about him,” says William Zabka, the actor who played Johnny in “Karate Kid” at age 18, and again at age 55 in “Cobra Kai.” “He’s never heard the term ‘cancel culture’ in his life. He’s not informed about what you can say, what you can’t say. He’s an artifact of the ‘80s.”<br />In the quest to launch TV hits with cross-generational appeal, producers are retrofitting vintage Hollywood stories with contemporary context. In the works: “Bel-Air,” a dramatic take on the sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” for the Black Lives Matter era. A new continuation of “Saved by the Bell,” the comedic high-school soap opera from the ‘90s, has gotten strong reviews on Peacock for popping the bubble of privilege its characters once existed in.</td>

      <td>Leaders of some large companies say they may withhold political donations and investments in states whose lawmakers are challenging Electoral College results</td>
      <td>In a virtual gathering of chief executives convened to discuss political turbulence stemming from the 2020 election, leaders of some of the largest U.S. companies said they were considering withholding donations to Republican lawmakers seeking to impede the presidential transition.<br />During an hourlong meeting Tuesday, a group of about three dozen chief executives discussed divisions in the country, efforts to thwart the presidential transition and what voice they thought business should have in politics, according to people who participated in the conversation. Some business leaders who have donated to Republican campaigns stated that they were considering withholding future political contributions to elected officials who have said they would oppose certifying the Electoral College results for President-elect Joe Biden, those people said.<br />Among business leaders on the call were Walt Disney Co. Executive Chairman Robert Iger, a noted Democrat who has indicated interest in an ambassador role under the Biden administration; Accenture PLC Chief Executive Officer Julie Sweet, a Republican who has donated to Sen. Ted Cruz; and Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier, who publicly broke with President Trump in 2017, but has donated to candidates from both parties, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The gathering included about a dozen advisers, such as former Obama administration Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Anthony Scaramucci, who served briefly in the Trump administration but has more recently been a critic of the president.<br />The gathering, along with a letter sent by nearly 200 CEOs on Monday urging Congress to accept the election results, marks a shift in tactics for business leaders, some of whom are joining forces to take newly strident positions on politics rather than speaking out individually. Other business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, have also issued statements this week calling for a smooth transition of power.<br />Also in the meeting, people familiar with the gathering said, were Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Senior Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, a Democrat, and Deloitte CEO Joseph Ucuzoglu, who doesn’t disclose his political affiliation, both of whom donated to Republicans in recent years. The discussion began with a conversation about political instability in the country, the people said.</td>

      <td>WHILE COLLECTING recipes for Balkan Treat Box—first a food truck, now a restaurant in Webster Groves, Mo.— chef Loryn Nalic traveled from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, through Eastern Europe and into Turkey. This dish, however, she discovered closer to home. “I always ate a chicken souvlaki sandwich at this Greek restaurant outside of town,” she said. It stuck with her.<br />But as her first Slow Food Fast recipe reveals, Ms. Nalic didn’t stick to that version. Her travels taught her how to freshen up the street-food standby with herbs, lemon, garlic and a great yogurt sauce.<br />It starts with marinating diced chicken thigh meat with oregano, parsley and lemon zest. While those aromatics go to work on the chicken, you can make the tzatziki, a cucumber-yogurt sauce that packs a bracing garlic punch. When it’s time to cook the meat, feel free to grill, broil or pan-sear—whatever you have to do to get a good char.<br />Nestled into warm pita (or whatever flatbread you prefer), drizzled with tzatziki, that smoky chicken becomes a satisfying meal.

      <td>Market reaction to Georgia runoff shows that partisan division in Washington is no longer good for stocks</td>
      <td>The old cliché that investors prefer divided government is in need of an update.<br />After Democrats won one Georgia Senate seat and appeared poised to take another Wednesday morning, which would deliver them control of the Senate, market reaction was mostly positive. This goes against the conventional wisdom that stocks do best when at least one chamber of Congress is controlled by the party in opposition to the president, preventing any dramatic or radical moves that could unsettle markets.<br />Although Nasdaq futures were lower Wednesday morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was poised to build on Tuesday’s gains. Perhaps most notably, yields on U.S. government bonds jumped, reflecting higher growth expectations and giving a boost to banks and other financial companies.<br />In light of recent history, this reaction shouldn’t be surprising. In past decades, divided government might have meant moderation and compromise in policy-making. In 2021, though, it would likely mean paralysis, which isn’t what the U.S. economy needs right now. Look no further than the prolonged negotiations over a second coronavirus-relief package, which eventually yielded a smaller-than-expected sum that came too late to save many struggling businesses as the economy entered a bleak winter.<br />A Democratic-controlled Senate likely means that more fiscal stimulus is on the way, not just in the form of checks to individuals but also infrastructure spending and aid to cash-strapped local governments. No wonder interest rates are ticking higher.</td>

As we’ve seen lately, uncertainty continues with developments like the new variant of Covid-19 and slower vaccine distribution. But there’s a lot we can know about travel in the new year. Here are some predictions:<br />Airlines will respond to increases in demand for seats with higher prices much faster than they can get more flights into schedules. There’s tons of pent-up demand, and when it spills out into bookings, prices in some markets will surge.<br />Hotels in prime destinations will seem maddeningly expensive. Downtown luxury business hotels will stay especially cheap, since their core business travelers won’t be coming back in droves yet.<br />Airline pricing right now often follows our own hopes and expectations. I tracked tickets for the same dates each month in 2021 in five markets and found that tickets are really cheap early in the year—when there likely will be little travel—and more expensive for summer bookings, when airlines anticipate healthy demand.<br />Between New York and Los Angeles, for example,  JetBlue  had round trips for $211 in on the dates I checked (departing the 23rd of each month and returning on the 28th) in February, March and April. May jumped to $386—a more normal fare for advance bookings.</td>

The recommendation comes after public-health institutions elsewhere have explored the possibility of delaying second doses so that more people can receive their first.<br />“This vaccine provides us with another tool to overcome the current emergency,” said Emer Cooke, executive director of the European Medicines Agency. “It is a testament to the efforts and commitment of all involved that we have this second positive vaccine recommendation just short of a year since the pandemic was declared.”<br />Since Dec. 27, the EU has been offering its first authorized vaccine, developed by  BioNTech SE  and  Pfizer Inc.,  to nursing-home residents and health-care workers. But the rollout has been slowed by logistical bottlenecks, wasted doses, the challenges of bringing temperature-sensitive vaccines to distant facilities, and reluctance by even some hospital staff to receive a novel vaccine against a disease many of them have already contracted.</td>

Mr. Ho said he understood the arrest was due to Mr. Clancey’s involvement in a political group active in last year’s pro-democratic election primaries, events which are at the center of the investigation.<br />Mr. Clancey couldn’t be reached for comment. People who know him said he was a decadeslong Hong Kong resident, fluent in the city’s local language of Cantonese and active in a number of groups and causes advocating for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong, mainland China and the region.<br />In a video posted to social media by a local news outlet, Mr. Clancey could be seen walking with a cane from his office to a police van and surrounded by reporters. “Continue to work for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong,” he said when asked if he had a message for the people of Hong Kong.<br />“He’s certainly one of the most peaceful and reasonable persons that you’re ever going to meet,” said Mark Daly, a Hong Kong lawyer who has worked on human-rights issues with Mr. Clancey. “It certainly is a concern with this national security law that possibly even promoting democracy and human rights may be considered an offense.”</td>

The company, along with local authorities, says vandals showing support for a protest that has blocked the roads into New Delhi for more than a month are responsible for damaging the cell towers.<br />Reliance controls India’s biggest cellular company and its largest retailer, including some of the country’s largest grocery-store chains. Those chains are expected to benefit from a new law that deregulates the farming industry to allow more private-sector control of distribution. Mr. Ambani, worth around $75 billion according to Forbes magazine, is seen as close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is backing the new law. He is one of the most influential corporate leaders in New Delhi.<br />The state of Punjab said on Tuesday that it had deployed more than 1,000 people to protect Reliance assets across the state. The company had petitioned courts this week in Punjab and the state of Haryana, where it has more than 20 million cellular customers, for more protection for its retail stores and towers for its Jio telephone network.<br />Reliance has “sought the urgent intervention of government authorities to bring a complete stop to the illegal acts of vandalism by miscreants,” it said on Monday, without specifying exactly what actions it expected authorities to take. “These acts of violence have endangered the lives of thousands of its employees and caused damage and disruption to the vital communications infrastructure.”</td>

Should you accept government money, and the strings attached with it, to try to catch up?<br />Scenarios like that are already being studied by first-year M.B.A. students at Harvard University and other business schools around the country. The courses are aimed at analyzing management decisions—good and bad—made during the pandemic and gleaning what lessons can be taught, given the benefit of hindsight.<br />“My aspiration was to give them, as future leaders, a way to judge these things. How do I ask the right questions? How do I make a reasoned judgment?” Harvard Business School professor Willy Shih said about this pharmaceutical case study used in his fall course, which also exposed students to the inner workings of the life-sciences industry.<br />His technology and operations-management class—which was taught online and in person on the school’s Boston campus—considered how the company could offset the costs of clinical trials and ramping up manufacturing by accepting funding from Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government’s coronavirus vaccine program. But the M.B.A. candidates also had to weigh whether the company would want the requirements that come attached to such funding, including allowing the government to control how the vaccine is priced.<br />After more than an hour of debate, most students agreed that the drugmaker should forgo government funding, Mr. Shih said. Many advocated the company stick to private development, saying it was better for the long-term health of its vaccine business that it doesn’t rely on government help.</td>

      <td>Surging ethereum prices may drive demand for mining gear with the latest gaming chips</td>
      <td>The good news is that  Nvidia  won’t have any problem selling its new gaming chips. The bad news might be who exactly gets their hands on them.<br />The recent surge in cryptocurrency prices is likely boosting demand for Nvidia’s graphics processors. Those chips are designed for videogaming, but are also used to “mine” cryptocurrencies such as ethereum. This process, which involves matching and updating cryptocurrency transactions in return for rewards, gets more profitable the higher prices get. And with ethereum prices now back above the $1,000 mark—and having nearly doubled since Christmas—crypto-driven demand is likely to affect Nvidia’s sales for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends this month. Mitch Steves of RBC Capital said in a report Tuesday that ethereum above $1,000 spells “robust” demand for high-end graphics chips.<br />Just how much of an impact remains to be seen. Jon Peddie, whose eponymous firm tracks the market for graphics chips and related add-in boards, wrote in a report last month that the latest boards with expanded memory banks from both Nvidia and  Advanced Micro Devices  are “extremely attractive to miners.” And Nvidia’s newest chips have been hot property since going on sale in September. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told a  UBS  conference last month that the company has seen “overwhelming demand” and still faces some supply challenges. Wall Street is projecting a surge of 58% in Nvidia’s gaming revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter. That would be the segment’s biggest jump in three years, when the last crypto bubble inflated demand for its chips in early 2018.<br />Nvidia will no doubt try to better gauge the impact this time around. Ms. Kress said at the conference that the company has “spent some quality time” to improve its understanding of its sales channels. Lack of clarity really hurt the company during the last crypto bubble when soaring revenue growth came to an abrupt halt as crypto-miners started dumping their boards on the secondary market after ethereum prices plunged, hurting sales of new chips. Nvidia’s share price fell 31% that year following an 81% jump the year before.<br />But Nvidia’s stock price has just seen an even stronger run, more than doubling in value over the past 12 months. And the crypto effect will most certainly be temporary even if prices remain elevated, as coming changes to the ethereum network will diminish the need for graphics processors. Mr. Steves of RBC expects those changes to take effect later this year or early next year, which will likely result in miners trying to sell off their chips at that point. Nvidia’s best hope may be that gamers keep the miners from getting their hands on too many of them.</td>

Exhibit A is Beijing’s decision to bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and impose new national-security legislation on the city on July 1 to stamp out a yearlong protest movement.<br />Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed government moved quickly to make use of those powers to pacify the city, arresting protesters, ejecting four pro-democracy lawmakers from the city’s legislature and rounding up opposition figures. Most recently, 53 were arrested in a series of dawn raids on Jan. 6 over allegations of plotting to subvert the city’s government.<br />The U.S. has taken steps to punish Beijing by restricting visas for Chinese officials and declaring that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to merit special treatment on trade in goods such as defense technologies. It also imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials and Hong Kong governing figures including Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Here’s how we got to this point.<br />Around 1,000 police officers arrested 53 pro-democracy figures in a high-profile operation that involved searching 72 locations across the city on Jan. 6. It was the biggest swoop since the law was imposed.<br />The allegations center on unofficial primaries held by opposition groups in July for the public to choose the most popular candidates for legislative elections planned for September. More than 600,000 people voted. The pro-democracy camp sought to win more than half of the 70 seats in the city’s legislature and said it would use a majority to block government policy. Many candidates were subsequently disqualified, and officials then postponed the poll for a year, citing the coronavirus situation.</td>

      <td>Serum Institute to manufacture vaccines not just for the world’s second-most populous country, but likely many others too</td>
      <td>India has authorized two Covid-19 vaccines for use, putting its enormous vaccine-manufacturing capacity in the spotlight. Large parts of the rich world may have something valuable to learn.<br />The Serum Institute of India is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, founded over 50 years ago by now-multibillionaire Cyrus Poonawalla. It will likely provide not only almost all the vaccines administered in India, but many elsewhere in the world too, once exports are permitted later in the year.<br />Research by Fitch Solutions outlines three groups of Asian economies this year: Those that can plausibly vaccinate most of the people in priority groups such as health-care workers and the elderly by June, those that can do so by September and those that will take longer. India is by some distance the lowest-income country in the first group of economies, which includes Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Malaysia. Wealthier South Korea and Thailand will take longer.<br />The Serum Institute’s work requires a reliable and large domestic supply of the vials in which the vaccines are sealed and transported, ensured by companies such as Schott Kaisha and Piramal Glass. The existence of the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer helps to establish the basis for a domestic network of suppliers.<br />Global supply chains and international trade have actually held up remarkably well under extreme circumstances over the past year. There is no need to reshore enormous amounts of manufacturing capacity, and any attempt at even halfway autarky will make all parties involved—importers and exporters—less prosperous.</td>

I have been assured that China is speeding up the internal procedure.”<br />“We are eager to get the mission under way as soon as possible,” he added.</td>

      <td>Blockbuster rally of U.S. tech companies is regarded by money managers as hard to replicate in year ahead</td>
      <td>Investors betting on a continued economic rebound are increasingly looking beyond U.S. stocks.<br />Many money managers are focusing on emerging markets, which they expect to outperform as the global economy accelerates in the wake of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Some are also taking a look at European markets, which lagged behind in 2020 but are dominated by cyclical shares.<br />Investing in U.S. stocks, they say, has increasingly become a concentrated bet on the technology sector, which contributed more than half of the S&P 500’s 18% total return last year. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite fared even better, rising 45% including dividends. Those gains might be difficult to replicate in the new year.<br />“We feel like the opportunity from here going forward is really going to be in the international markets outside of the U.S.,” said Munish Malhotra, co-portfolio manager of global equity strategy at Cambiar Investors. Potential easing of Washington’s trade tensions with China could reduce a headwind, while in the U.S., big technology companies might face challenges trying to extend their rapid growth, he said.<br />Cambiar recently added to positions in the German engineering giant  Siemens AG  and the Macau casino operator  Sands China Ltd. , betting that both will benefit as the pandemic subsides.</td>

Jesus Durante III, the unit’s commander, later said “a handful” of guards got the shots in September and October to protect the president from exposure to the virus.<br />Mr. Durante said the president learned of it only after the two required shots had been given, and that the unit acted without the help or approval of any other authority.<br />“We vaccinated ourselves,” he said in a televised interview. “It’s so easy.”</td>

      <td>Covid-19 was easier on the car industry than initially expected, but might pose long-term challenges</td>
      <td>So far, the car industry has emerged from the pandemic with just a few dents. The longer-term impact could be uglier.<br />A total of 14.5 million passenger vehicles—a category spanning cars, sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks—were sold in the U.S. last year, according to Wards Intelligence. That is roughly 15% lower than in 2019, but much better than seemed possible when the first bout of Covid-19 cases prompted widespread dealership closures in the spring. Fourth-quarter sales were only 2% below their level in the same period of 2019.<br />While the fear of catching Covid-19 kept some people away from lots, much of the expected pain for the car industry was cushioned by a sudden preference for private over public transportation, allied with strong household spending on durable goods. U.S. vehicle routing requests on  Apple  maps collapsed in March, but recovered by late May, even as transit routing requests remained 60% below their January level. That helps explain why some of the money that didn’t go toward restaurants or holidays made its way into new and secondhand vehicles at surprisingly high prices.<br />These buoyant conditions will likely linger into the new year, given the fresh wave of infections, a second round of stimulus checks and rock-bottom interest rates. At some point, though, they will fade. As vaccines are rolled out and some aspects of life normalize, consumers should start to spend more money on flights and social activities again. Moreover, potentially stickier changes to the pre-Covid norm, such as remote working, might not be great for car sales further down the road.<br />Before the pandemic, almost 40% of the miles traveled by passenger vehicle in the U.S. were for commuting or shopping, according to data collated by KPMG. At least a chunk of that seems likely to disappear as people work at home more and order more products online. Demand for vehicles should follow. KPMG said more U.S. families might get by with one car in the future, potentially reducing the average number of vehicles per household to 1.87, from the pre-Covid level of 1.97.</td>

The arrests were related to their participation in unofficial election primaries held last year by the democratic camp ahead of planned legislative elections, they said.<br />The police operation is the biggest since the sweeping national security law was imposed six months ago, and activists said the arrests were the first related to alleged subversion, a serious crime under that law. The range and profile of the people arrested, comprising most of Hong Kong’s opposition, marks a dramatic escalation in authorities’ efforts to crush dissent in the city, which was racked by months of antigovernment street protests in 2019.<br />Less than two weeks after the security law was imposed, on the weekend of July 11 and 12, the opposition camp took part in self-organized primaries to select preferred candidates for elections scheduled for September. The aim was to improve chances of gaining a majority in the legislature, which participants said would allow them to block government legislation. Organizers said then that about 600,000 members of the public cast their votes.<br />Many of the politicians were told weeks later that their candidacies were invalid, with authorities citing concerns over their loyalty to the city and its constitution. Shortly after the disqualifications, the government postponed the elections by a year, citing the coronavirus pandemic.</td>

His bonus had taken a 36% hit in 2019 when his pay package fell as revenue and profit declined tied to weaker iPhone sales.<br />In the past fiscal year, despite a global pandemic that disrupted economies around the world, Apple’s profit rose 3.9% with laptops and iPads sales benefiting from workers and students stuck at home as part of efforts to slow the spread of Covid-19. Apple’s share price rose more than 80% in 2020, placing its market value at more than $2 trillion.<br />In addition to his compensation, Mr. Cook had a total of $281.9 million in restricted stock that vested during the year. Those shares were a core part of Mr. Cook’s long-term incentive package that was awarded in 2011 when he became CEO. The decadelong plan’s final tranche vests later this year.<br />In September, Apple’s board awarded a new long-term equity plan to Mr. Cook with shares that vest from 2023 through 2025, giving him incentive to stay on as CEO through that period.

Smith has accumulated 20 receiving touchdowns and 1,641 yards so far and will have a chance to add to his totals during the championship game against No. 3 Ohio State on Jan. 11 in Miami Gardens, Fla.<br />The Alabama senior took home 447 first-place votes, beating out a trio of quarterbacks: teammate Mac Jones, Trevor Lawrence of Clemson and Kyle Trask of Florida.<br />Smith is the third skill player from Alabama to win the Heisman Trophy in the last 12 years, a testament to the program’s rich history of recruiting.

      <td>Washington lawyer faced criticism after joining president to ask election officials to reverse Biden win</td>
      <td>Cleta Mitchell, a Washington, D.C., attorney who supported President Trump in making claims of election fraud on a weekend call with the Georgia secretary of state, resigned Tuesday from the partnership of a corporate law firm.<br />The firm, Foley & Lardner LLP, said Tuesday that Ms. Mitchell’s resignation was effective immediately and that she “concluded that her departure was in the firm’s best interests, as well as in her own personal best interests.”<br />Ms. Mitchell couldn’t immediately be reached for comment Tuesday. Her husband, Dale Mitchell, said she had been planning to retire in June.<br />“The left wingers are causing her trouble, but they’ve been causing her trouble,” he said. “She’s not exactly losing sleep over this.”<br />Criticism of Ms. Mitchell, known for public-finance work and taking on conservative causes, mounted after she appeared in support of Mr. Trump on the hourlong call with Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Raffensperger to find enough votes to reverse the state’s election results, which showed President-elect Joe Biden won by a margin of 11,779 out of about five million votes cast.</td>

Police also charged him with possession of what they said were two “high-capacity firearm magazines.”<br />The night of the burning, brawls broke out between some demonstrators supporting President Trump and counterprotesters. Several people, including eight police officers, were hurt, authorities said at the time. Four people were stabbed.<br />Mr. Tarrio’s arrest came the same day civil-rights groups filed a lawsuit against Mr. Tarrio and Proud Boys International LLC over vandalism they say the group committed at a second historic Black church in Washington.<br />The far-right group describes itself as a men’s organization for “Western chauvinists” and has often fought with left-wing activists.

      <td>Ceremony, originally set to take place on Jan. 31, has been pushed back to March 14</td>
      <td>The Grammy Awards ceremony has been postponed for two months, as concerns surge over the spread of Covid-19, according to the Recording Academy, which hosts the annual music-industry awards show.<br />The ceremony was originally set to take place on Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, with “The Daily Show” host and comedian Trevor Noah as host. Grammy organizers have pushed the event to March 14. The academy’s website earlier Tuesday showed the date had been pushed back to March 21.<br />In late November, the Recording Academy’s interim chief executive and president, Harvey Mason Jr., said there would be live performances at this year’s show but that—given the pandemic—there would be a limited in-person audience, if any audience at all. He also said the Grammys was working with medical experts to ensure artists and fans were safe. “I can definitely tell you there won’t be 17,000 fans there,” he said.<br />But since then, the U.S.—and California and Los Angeles County in particular—has seen a surge in coronavirus cases that gathered strength after Thanksgiving and the December holidays. On Monday, the U.S. reported 180,477 new infections, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. While the figure was down from a day earlier as holiday reporting lags continue to affect data, the seven-day average of new cases—which helps smooth out irregularities in data reporting—has risen above 200,000 again. California is the hardest hit U.S. state, with more than 2.45 million cases, according to Johns Hopkins.<br />“The deteriorating Covid situation in Los Angeles, with hospital services being overwhelmed, ICUs having reached capacity, and new guidance from state and local governments have all led us to conclude that postponing our show was the right thing to do,” the Recording Academy said in a joint statement with CBS, which is broadcasting the event. “Nothing is more important than the health and safety of those in our music community and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly on producing the show.”</td>

Mr. Mnuchin supports NYSE’s original plan to delist the companies, this official added.<br />News of his call to Ms. Cunningham was earlier reported by Bloomberg News.

Perhaps it’s because some Trump conspiracy theories about the nation’s political establishment turned out to be true. The Obama administration really did spy on Mr. Trump’s campaign and media outlets really have been out to get him. Therefore many Trump voters resist acknowledging the duly certified victory of Joe Biden, our President-elect.<br />Thiel Capital’s Eric Weinstein writes on Twitter that almost everyone he knows sees either “two conspiracies against Trump or zero.” He adds:<br />In a separate tweet, Mr. Weinstein writes about the media:<br />Speaking of the media, Mark Finkelstein at NewsBusters writes:<br />CNN’s Fareed Zakaria recently acknowledged “the dirty little secret” that the Trump administration “was pretty tough on the Russians. They armed Ukraine, they armed the Poles. They extended NATO operations and exercises in ways that even the Obama Administration had not done. They maintained the sanctions.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Treasury Department has sent out more than $112 billion in stimulus payments electronically, meaning that about two-thirds of the second round of payments approved by Congress is already in households’ bank accounts, according to data released Tuesday.<br />The payments—$600 per adult and $600 per child—were estimated to cost about $164 billion in all. They are part of a broader relief law last month that also includes unemployment insurance and money for small businesses.<br />The pace of payments is faster than in the spring, when the government made the first round of payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. Then, about half the payments reached bank accounts within two weeks. Now, more than two-thirds of the money has gone out within about one week after President Trump signed the law passed by Congress.<br />In addition to the $112 billion in electronic payments, the government is also mailing checks and prepaid debit cards. It hasn’t said how many payments have been made.<br />“While the IRS has been able to deliver the second round of Economic Impact Payments in record time, we understand there are many questions and we appreciate everyone’s patience during this period,” the agency said in a statement late Tuesday.</td>

      <td>Trump wants to upend the Electoral College. His VP knows better.</td>
      <td>Mike Pence surely understands his constitutional duty. When Congress meets in joint session on Wednesday to count the Electoral College votes, the Vice President’s role is clear: He is to preside honorably, if uncomfortably, over the democratic transfer of power, as 306 electors are tallied for Joe Biden’s victory.<br />President Trump’s  Twitter  feed, no surprise, is telling a different story. “The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,” he wrote Tuesday. Mr. Trump claims that he’s the victim of a massive electoral conspiracy, yet he can’t find the evidence to convince even conservative judges. Nevertheless, he wants Mr. Pence to throw out Mr. Biden’s electors.<br />This is a triple whammy. It’s false as a matter of fact, because no fraudulent electors exist. It’s false as a matter of law, because the Constitution empowers the Vice President merely to open the Electoral College certificates, not to count them, to say nothing of rejecting any. Finally, it’s a betrayal of the steadfast Mr. Pence that Mr. Trump is trying to discredit him in the eyes of GOP voters. Mr. Trump is showing once again that, to him, loyalty is a one-way street.<br />Some congressional Republicans, including Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, have said that they also intend to contest the November results under the Electoral Count Act. The law gives them that right, despite its dubious constitutionality. Still, the effort looks as futile as it should be. We’ve already examined their arguments here and won’t rehash them.<br />The good news is that other Republicans are entering the breach to defend federalism and the Constitution. Take Senator Tom Cotton, whose presidential dreams are as high as Mr. Cruz’s. “The Founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states—not Congress,” Mr. Cotton said Sunday. Overturning Mr. Biden’s win “would essentially end presidential elections.” Any objections Wednesday to duly certified electors, Mr. Cotton added, “will only embolden those Democrats who want to erode further our system of constitutional government.”</td>

      <td>The Saudi-Qatari diplomatic truce is an opportunity for Biden.</td>
      <td>Even in its lame duck period, the Trump Administration isn’t done pushing diplomatic deals in the Mideast. In December Morocco moved to normalize relations with Israel, and now Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain will end their three-and-a-half-year blockade of Qatar. If the Biden Administration is wise, it will capitalize on the greater unity among America’s Middle Eastern allies as a bulwark against Iranian regional mischief.<br />Qatar, an oil-rich nation in the Persian Gulf that hosts a U.S. air base, has been at odds for years with the neighboring monarchies. In June 2017, four Arab countries announced a boycott, halting air travel and disrupting trade. Qatar was hardly a blameless victim in the dispute, having supported the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist causes in Libya and elsewhere. As we wrote at the time, the reckoning may have been needed to send a warning to Doha.<br />But in a new agreement signed in Saudi Arabia, and negotiated by Kuwait as well as Trump Mideast czar Jared Kushner, the blockade of Qatar is largely coming to an end. Flights will resume between the neighboring Arab states, and the countries made expressions of goodwill. Trade and investment can also pick up again.<br />The agreement seems intended to patch deeper ideological fissures between Qatar and the conservative Gulf monarchies, rather than heal them. Doha agreed to drop legal claims against the countries but did not make public commitments to curtail its disruptive behavior. Yet the risk from continued division in the Gulf was that Qatar would drift closer to Turkey and especially Iran, with which it shares a maritime border.<br />Some in the Biden Administration may be eager to punish Saudi Arabia given its human-rights record, but the move shows that Riyadh is making concessions to improve stability in its neighborhood. The Biden team has signaled its eagerness to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, but Tuesday’s agreement shows that the Arab monarchies are drawing closer in part to balance Iran.</td>

      <td>Speaker Nancy Pelosi knows she has a narrow majority in the new House, and she’s already taking steps to make sure she can still roll over the opposition.<br />Most media attention on the 45 pages of revised House rules for the 117th Congress has focused on the woke provisions. The Democrats banned from the rules document such gendered terms as “father” or “daughter,” in favor of “parent” and “child.” This has rightly earned derision, though not enough. The rules also create a new Select Committee on Economic Disparity and Fairness in Growth, which is best understood as a committee to justify higher taxes and a larger entitlement state. Isn’t that every committee?<br />More important for legislation, however, the rules all but eliminate what is called the motion to recommit. This legislative tool has existed since the first Congress, and for nearly 90 years it has allowed the minority party to offer the last amendment to legislation. The motions typically fail, but they are a way for the minority to highlight and provoke a debate on controversial questions.<br />Last month, for instance, Arizona Republican Debbie Lesko offered a motion to recommit to the Democratic bill legalizing marijuana. Her provision would have guaranteed the right of private companies to test employees or applicants for the drug. Her motion failed, but 11 House Democrats voted with her.<br />With a majority perhaps as small as nine votes, Mrs. Pelosi is clearly worried she could lose such motions. At the demand of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the new rules strip the minority of the ability to use the motions to amend bills. Republicans will only be able to offer motions that send a bill back to committee. This spares swing-district Democrats from difficult votes and reduces Mrs. Pelosi’s chance of defeat on the floor. Even former GOP whip Tom DeLay never imposed that one.</td>

Politicians believed their strict lockdowns and mask mandates would defeat the virus, but they didn’t, and the latest infection surge has exposed deep problems.<br />Hospitalizations in California have increased seven-fold since early November and are nearly three times higher than at the summer peak. California Gov. Gavin Newsom justified reimposing a lockdown in mid-November based on projections that the state’s health-care system would be overwhelmed by virus cases. Yet state and local officials failed to prepare hospitals for the surge that their models predicted.<br />As hospitals burst at the seams last month, the state finally rushed to construct field hospitals in some counties. Yet hospitals in Los Angeles have been forced to convert chapels and gift lobbies into makeshift wards. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last week was deployed to several LA hospitals to fix aging oxygen pipes that were freezing under pressure.<br />Many hospitals are also short of oxygen tanks for patients to take home so they can free up beds. Patients have waited eight hours in ambulances lined up outside hospitals before being admitted. Ambulance wait times for other emergencies have increased, and “non-essential” care including cancer treatments has been halted.<br />Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn late last week implored Mr. Newsom to bring back the USNS Mercy naval ship to relieve pressure on hospitals. The ship was deployed to the Port of LA during the spring for a surge that didn’t happen and then left.</td>

      <td>There was real evidence of fraud, but the country couldn’t afford a crisis.</td>
      <td>Vice President Richard Nixon was preparing to leave office in January 1961, but he still had several constitutional duties to carry out. On Tuesday, Jan. 3, as president of the Senate, he had the task of convening that body for the meeting of the 87th Congress. Later that week, as spelled out in the 12th Amendment, he presided over a joint session of Congress to “open all the Certificates” and count the Electoral College votes that would declare his rival—Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kennedy—the winner of the 1960 presidential election.<br />The pageantry for the joint session began when two tellers carried the electors’ ballots into the House chamber. Nixon, walking alone wearing a dark suit and a forced smile, followed them to the rostrum where the session was gaveled to order at 12:55 p.m. Nixon began the vote count, which would last for more than an hour. When the tally was complete, Kennedy had received 303 electoral votes, Nixon 219 and Sen. Harry Byrd 15.<br />Before adjourning the joint session, Nixon asked the speaker for “permission” to make a brief statement. He declared that his defeat and his opponent’s victory were an “eloquent example of the stability of our constitutional system and of the proud tradition of the American people of developing, respecting and honoring institutions of self-government.” He congratulated his opponents and declared Kennedy the new president and Lyndon Johnson the new vice president.<br />After the long and tedious count, the chamber erupted with a prolonged ovation. Montana Democratic Sen. Mike Mansfield commented: “What a way to go . . . with dignity and with head held high.” Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey said that the vice president’s remarks would “go down as one of the truly historic messages. It was one filled with humility. It was a gracious and a very thoughtful pronouncement.”<br />It had been one of the closest elections in American history—marked, as we know now, by substantial electoral fraud—but Nixon did not challenge the result. On the contrary, he directed two of his chief aides, campaign manager Robert Finch and campaign press secretary Herbert Klein, to tamp down calls for a recount. He asked the New York Herald Tribune reporter Earl Mazo to stop writing articles on allegations of fraud in Illinois and Texas. He told Attorney General William Rogers not to investigate voting irregularities and telephoned Illinois Gov. William Stratton, a fellow Republican, urging him to certify Kennedy’s triumph in his state.</td>

      <td>This week’s Electoral College challenge is in part the result of tribal media consumption.</td>
      <td>Scores of Republicans in Congress will vote Wednesday to reject the Electoral College results in the 2020 presidential election. This comes despite the rulings from Trump-appointed federal judges in state after state rejecting the president’s assertions that he was cheated, and despite the Supreme Court’s rejection of his frivolous appeals. President Trump leapfrogs among dozens of conspiracy theories, but not a single court—in roughly four dozen attempts—has found sufficient evidence for his claims.<br />Senators know that the president’s social-media rantings are bunk. In our conversations, no one argues that the election was actually stolen. The arguments offered are instead about how Mr. Trump and his core supporters will respond to the certification vote. Republicans are facing tremendous pressure from a vocal minority, and they are wrestling with very real political consequences.<br />In a play, a rifle hanging above the fireplace in the first act must be fired by the third act. At some point Republicans, Democrats or some yet unformed party will fire the gun that Republican election objectors load this week. If voting against the Electoral College is an easy new way to signal disappointment, politicians will make it a quadrennial habit. Basic trust in our elections will evaporate and, down the road, a congressional majority may succeed in changing an outcome.<br />Despite these dangerous innovations in Congress, the deeper problem in our politics is on the demand side. Our central crisis isn’t the existence of political drug dealers. It is that we have a society-wide addiction to clickbait crack that treats politics like blood sport. Fifteen percent to 20% of Americans—our friends and neighbors on the left and right—are hooked.<br />Our politics has become so poisonous that members of Congress now see personal benefit in posturing or actually attempting to overturn a presidential election, thereby disenfranchising millions of Americans for the sin of voting for the other party. Our institutions aren’t meant for this, and the constant horse-race analysis and apocalyptic rhetoric will push us further and faster into idiocracy.</td>

The legislators won elections last month that were boycotted by the opposition and deemed a sham by countries like the U.S., Brazil and neighboring Colombia.<br />The opposition had been in control of the National Assembly since 2015 but saw most of its powers stripped away by authoritarian President Nicolás Maduro in recent years. Among the newly elected assembly lawmakers are Mr. Maduro’s son and wife.<br />“The U.S. firmly rejects the farcical swearing in of the ill-named National Assembly that fake President Maduro is trying to impose,” the U.S. Embassy’s special section on Venezuela, which is based in neighboring Colombia, said in a Twitter post Tuesday.<br />Mr. Maduro now controls all formal levers of power, including the security services, as he tightens his grip on a country where the economy has collapsed in recent years, prompting millions of Venezuelans to flee.</td>

      <td>Democratic speech police demand not only tolerance but endorsement of the progressive agenda.</td>
      <td>In his 1946 essay, “Politics and the English Language,” George Orwell wrote that political language “consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.” The description fits Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s new House rules on gender-neutral speech to a tee.<br />On Monday, the Democratic-controlled lower chamber voted along party lines to approve new official language guidelines. Words such as “himself” and “herself” are to be replaced by “themself.” Out with “father,” “mother,” “son,” “daughter,” “brother,” “sister,” “uncle,” “aunt” and other familial terms, and in with “parent,” “child,” “sibling” and so forth. An incensed Kevin McCarthy, the Republican minority leader, tweeted that the changes “are stupid,” which is true but incomplete.<br />Mrs. Pelosi is obviously attempting to placate the progressives in her caucus, however it’s also another example of how the political left today demands not only tolerance but endorsement. You can’t disagree respectfully, let alone agree not to agree. It’s bad enough when our colleges and universities enforce what amount to speech codes, or indulge efforts to shield students from dissenting viewpoints. Now we have lawmakers in Washington offering a kind of a federal imprimatur on limiting free expression.<br />The next time Republicans control the House, they can and should reverse these changes. There’s little evidence that anyone besides far-left elites is obsessed with a gender-neutral vocabulary. In recent years, Democratic activists have tried to popularize the word “Latinx” in lieu of Latino and Latina. But a Pew Research Center poll taken last year found that just 3% of Hispanics self-describe as Latinx.<br />Nevertheless, what the left is attempting to do here goes well beyond semantic tinkering. The goal is not simply to tell us what we can or can’t say aloud, but to redefine common words and expressions to advance a political agenda. Hence, discussions of “racial diversity” somehow omit Asian-Americans. And blacks are to be identified by their race—with an uppercase “B,” no less—when they are victims of police shootings but not when they are criminal suspects.</td>

      <td>The meritocratic ideal makes elites arrogant and threatens communal solidarity. Identity-based policies make the problem worse.</td>
      <td>For the past decade, and especially since the election of Donald Trump, liberal writers have begun to rethink the left’s decades-long infatuation with individual autonomy and the attendant loss of solidarity in American life. Three or four decades ago, they couldn’t stop ridiculing 1950s America for its supposed dullness and “conformity.” But lately it has occurred to many of them that a society bereft of shared ideals isn’t the happy place they once assumed it would be.<br />These liberals typically don’t assign blame for the breakup of American life to themselves and their forerunners on the political left. They aren’t prepared to trace the invidious phenomenon known as identity politics back to the cultural revolution of the 1960s, and they express little regret for the left’s hostility to religion and contempt for tradition. Instead they pin the blame for American culture’s breakup on various forms of market deregulation. The free-enterprise policies of the 1980s and ’90s, they argue, legitimated greed, widened inequality and encouraged Americans to forget their collective identity.<br />Michael Sandel is a man of the left and accordingly takes a disapproving view of the economic liberalization carried out under Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, but Mr. Sandel has worried about the loss of solidarity in American life for far longer than have most of his political allies. His first book, “Liberalism and the Limits of Justice” (1982), criticized the influential philosopher John Rawls for positing an atomized and thus unrealistic conception of the individual. The essays collected in “Public Philosophy” (2005) likewise scolded the author’s fellow liberals for paying insufficient attention to communal values.<br />In “The Tyranny of Merit: What’s Become of the Common Good?” Mr. Sandel, a professor of political philosophy at Harvard, casts a critical eye on the ideal of meritocracy. The meritocratic model, he believes, has become the de facto creed of both the center-left and the center-right in America. Hence the commonplace, intoned by politicians of both parties, that those who “play by the rules” should be able to “rise as far as their talent and hard work will take them.”<br />Everybody can sympathize with the sentiment behind that thought, but there are two major problems with it, in Mr. Sandel’s view. The first is that it’s an aspiration, an ideal, that Americans increasingly take to be a reality when it isn’t. A young person may be intellectually gifted and possess an excellent work ethic, but if he comes from a low-income home he won’t have the advantages enjoyed by a slightly dumber and lazier student from a privileged background.</td>

Many voters still think the November election was unfair, he said.<br />He could have added that saying an election was unfair is tantamount to saying an election was held. Elections are unfair. Unfairness is part of the fitness test. Campaigns lie about each other. The media plays favorites. Partisans jigger the rules in their own favor. If Mr. Trump didn’t find a way to prevail in the world we actually live in, the blame starts with him.<br />Of course the microscopic margin rankles—he lost the pivotal electoral votes of Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin by fewer than 43,000 votes. He has every reason to be beside himself since he absurdly oversupplied these voters with reasons to vote against him and he still almost won.<br />Imagine a team so bad and good at the same time that it would have prevailed if it had fumbled the ball 1% fewer times in its own endzone.<br />Any loser has grievances. Ask John Kerry. But Mr. Trump griping about the media is like griping about his biggest asset. Having the right enemies made him president in the first place and was poised to serve him even better the second time around.</td>

It understands that OPEC+ members are struggling and would like to make a gesture of goodwill. A more realistic read is that the Kingdom’s hand has weakened considerably in its tug of war with Russia regarding the direction of global oil output.<br />In a press conference Tuesday, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud stressed that the decision was made unilaterally. Yet he also said Russia was aware of its plans to announce a cut.<br />Despite Saudi Arabia’s large capacity, a million barrels is a substantial sacrifice, equating to roughly 9% of its typical production. The amount is also symbolically a departure from the parallel path that Saudi Arabia and Russia had taken so far; the countries had been holding back an equal number of barrels.</td>

      <td>The new comedy from Robert Carlock and Tina Fey stars Ted Danson as a retired businessman turned mayor of Los Angeles.</td>
      <td>Ted Danson as the mayor of Los Angeles? It requires no stretch of the imagination at all, especially in electorally eccentric California: He’s extremely likable, telegenic, his style is self-effacing, and he’s tall enough to make his “Mr. Mayor” antagonist, Arpi Meskimen (Holly Hunter), seem like a ferocious Munchkin. The optics of television comedy and politics are essentially the same, the show reminds us. Blink and you’re not sure which you’re watching.<br />Or, in this case, when. “I was quarantining before it was cool,” former businessman Neil Bremer (Mr. Danson) tells the assembled L.A. press, having come out of a comfortable, sedentary and close-to-cloistered retirement to win the mayoralty with 68% of the vote (“of the 8% who voted,” someone reminds us). “Too soon,” mutters communications director Jayden Kwapis (Bobby Moynihan), and viewers may agree: The show acknowledges Covid-19 without making any concessions to it (masks, distancing, etc.) while still seeming to be set in the here and now, as Bremer’s predecessor is seen declaring that “2020 broke me!” before resigning his office and asking a green cab to drive him into the ocean. The show may be set in a not-too-distant, pandemic-free future, but there’s also the question of whether right now is the time for political comedy. It may be that the time is just right.<br />Created by Robert Carlock and Tina Fey, “Mr. Mayor” imagines what would happen if a wealthy, overly confident and intellectually incurious middle-aged-plus man—who previously led a billion-dollar outdoor-advertising company— were elected to one of the higher offices in urban America. Like previous projects the pair have been involved with, notably “30 Rock” and “The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” it dispenses with a laugh track, which is a bit risky given the ambiguity of some of the jokes, never mind the extreme L.A.-centric slant of the show. “He thinks Santa Monica is part of L.A.,” says Neil’s despairing chief of staff, Mikaela Shaw (Vella Lovell), who had only joined the Bremer campaign thinking the candidate would lose. She considers the mayor’s geographic impairment proof of his general ineptitude, but it’s pretty safe to say that a lot of people who live outside Southern California think Santa Monica is part of L.A. and might not quite grasp the hilarity of that particular laugh line. Likewise, Mikaela’s dismissive shorthand on Councilwoman Meskimen: “She represents East Hollywood, Little Bangladesh and the Hollywood Forever Cemetery,” which might be funny if you really know L.A. And even then...<br />Oddly enough, the show’s real potential lies in that same L.A.-Hollywood comedic landscape where a lot of the jokes get lost. Bremer is barely in office when there’s a dispute about whether the word “coyote” amounts to cultural appropriation, whether they should be called “mini-wolves” instead and get free reproductive services. One of Mr. Mayor’s first official acts is to announce a ban on plastic straws, which enrages two constituencies: his teenage daughter, Orly (Kyla Kenedy), because she’s made the issue part of her campaign for student-body president, and the disabled community, members of which need bendable straws. The latter find a champion in Arpi (sounds like R.P.), who during a private meeting with Bremer preps him for the political-correctness battles to come: “I want to see your water bill during the 2017 drought,” she says, devilishly. “Charter schools: Yea or nay? Did you post the black square on Instagram? Either way—how dare you!” The mayor, who proudly declares himself “not a politician,” is befuddled by the paradoxical proprieties of current-day American politics, which are portrayed by the series with refreshing frankness.<br />It took “Happy Days” five seasons to jump the shark; “Mr. Mayor” arguably does it in episode 2, with Bremer consuming some edibles at the ceremonial opening of L.A.’s “10,000th pot dispensary” (“Buy drugs!” he exhorts the crowd) and then careening from one public-relations calamity to another. The show has its charms, principally Mr. Danson, but his character will need some refining (only two episodes were available for review). Is he just a doofus, or a guy with enough native intelligence to make on-the-job training work? He seems to know how to deal with the pesky Meskimen, but their contretemps have just begun. “What’s your beef?” he asks Arpi, who replies—and you know it’s coming—“No beef. I’m a vegan.”</td>

      <td>A new Criterion set showcases three late films by the surrealistic and subversive Spanish director.</td>
      <td><br /><br />In one of the generous video supplements that add value to Criterion’s essential new set “Three Films by Luis Buñuel,” viewers will see a close-up of a photograph from 1972 picturing what must be the single greatest gathering of 20th-century film directors—among them George Cukor, Alfred Hitchcock, George Stevens, Billy Wilder, Robert Wise and William Wyler. (John Ford was also at the gathering, a lunch at Cukor’s house, but left before the photo.) And in the center of them all, seated between Stevens and Hitchcock, is Buñuel.<br />Born in Spain in 1900, Buñuel led a peripatetic life, with stints in France and the U.S. (where he made no films) before he settled in Mexico. Later, extended visits to France and Spain would return him to international prominence. In the process, he gave the world a number of cinematic landmarks, including the surrealistic touchstone “Un Chien Andalou” (1929), the damning “Los Olvidados” (1950) and the still discomfiting “Belle de Jour” (1967). What no one could have known—least of all Buñuel, who kept insisting he’d made his final film—was that ahead of him stretched the trio now gathered on Blu-ray: “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie” (1972), “The Phantom of Liberty” (1974) and “That Obscure Object of Desire” (1977). (Criterion’s previous editions of the films on DVD, once available singly but with fewer extras, are long out of print.)<br />In addition to being directed by Buñuel—or Don Luis, as he was often called—these three pictures were all co-written, in French, by Jean-Claude Carrière, shot by Edmond Richard and produced by Serge Silberman, Buñuel’s great champion during this Indian summer. Pierre Lary, Buñuel’s right hand in these years, also contributed manfully, working both behind and in front of the camera. But most viewers will focus on the casts, which feature a number of European stars: Jean-Claude Brialy, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Fernando Rey, Michel Piccoli, Delphine Seyrig, Monica Vitti, etc. Equally important is the group of lesser-known but no less gifted actors who enhance this informal triptych in small but significant roles—a Buñuel stock company that includes Julien Bertheau, Paul Frankeur, Milena Vukotic and Muni, among others.</td>

Mr. Garzón and the legal team have argued that Mr. Saab, who was granted citizenship by Mr. Maduro’s government, had been on a commercial mission for the regime and had diplomatic immunity.<br />Mr. Garzón said pressure from the U.S. has made it a challenge to win the release of Mr. Saab, who was arrested in June when his private plane stopped to refuel at Cape Verde, an island country nearly 400 miles off West Africa.</td>

      <td>A PBS docuseries examines the ways in which aid groups deal with natural catastrophes.</td>
      <td>Viewers should be forgiven if they see the listing “When Disaster Strikes,” shake their heads and say, “Oh Lord, what now?” But the three-part PBS docuseries is, despite its title, relatively upbeat, especially in the way it explains how global catastrophes are confronted, who does the confronting, and the degree of expertise they bring to floods, famines, droughts and hurricanes. It’s a series about bringing hope to seemingly hopeless situations, yes. But it is more about planning, competence and crisis management.<br />Audiences in most of the developed world might be grateful knowing they haven’t, or haven’t yet, been hammered by the kind of weather-related catastrophes suffered by the subject areas of the series, namely Mozambique, Somalia and the Bahamas. And seeing the way relief organizations respond when they do. More than 100 nongovernmental organizations came into Mozambique following the devastating Cyclone Idai of 2019, one of the most severe and costliest storms ever to hit Africa, or even the Southern Hemisphere, causing massive flooding and displacing hundreds of thousands. “When Disaster Strikes” is conscientiously unsentimental, but even a veteran aid worker like Emma Batey, a U.N.-associated coordinator of humanitarian aid groups, is brought to tears by the memory of how workers were forced to make choices about whom to save, or not, across a terrain where water stretched to the horizon and people took refuge in trees. “If you couldn’t swim there was no way to get out,” recalls one survivor.<br />The second installment (new episodes play Wednesdays at 10 p.m.) concerns the now-decade-old drought in Somalia, which as one of the interviewees points out is usually the kind of climate crisis that can be predicted and planned for. The exceptional problems of Somalia include the severity of the drought, its duration, and that fact that two-thirds of Somalis are nomadic, herders of livestock that have perished in droves from lack of water. Estimates say a quarter of a million lives have been lost over the course of the drought, but it is clear that without the resources—and resourcefulness—of the global support community, it would have been much worse.<br />The third episode deals with the Bahamas in the aftermath of 2019’s Hurricane Dorian and an aid effort spearheaded by the U.S. Navy, which deployed dozens of special aircraft, ships and personnel in its efforts to rescue and resuscitate the islands.<br />Narrated by Crystal Claire Simmonds, who strikes a balance somewhere between BBC World News and a Sarah McLachlan dog-rescue commercial, the series begins with an odd paraphrase of George Orwell: “All countries are equal. But when it comes to disasters, some countries are more equal than others.” It’s a baffling bit of rhetorical nonsense. The point that “When Disaster Strikes” makes, aside from celebrating various humanitarian aid efforts, is that some countries are more vulnerable to weather calamities than others—but that the humanitarian aid community draws no distinctions between African nations, Caribbean islands or, if it came to it, New York City. Not all disaster series are equal. But this one is certainly more reassuring than others.</td>

      <td>State Sen. Jim Brewster was certified as winner by election officials, but GOP leaders say a legal challenge remains</td>
      <td>Republicans leaders of the Pennsylvania Senate refused to seat a Democrat whose win was certified by state election officials, prompting Democratic senators to walk out on the first day of the legislative session.<br />The majority Senate Republicans on Tuesday also removed Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman from presiding over the day’s session in Harrisburg, the state capital, after Mr. Fetterman declined to go along with the move.<br />State officials certified incumbent Sen. Jim Brewster as the winner of a Senate contest in Western Pennsylvania. State election results show Mr. Brewster defeated his Republican challenger Nicole Ziccarelli by 69 votes out of more than 132,000 votes cast.<br />Republican Sen. Jake Corman, the top-ranking senator, said Monday he wouldn’t permit Mr. Brewster to be sworn in because of Ms. Ziccarelli’s pending lawsuit in federal court. The suit alleges that the Allegheny County Board of Elections improperly counted mail-in ballots that were signed but undated. In late November, the state Supreme Court ruled against Ms. Ziccarelli, finding that a missing date wasn’t a reason to invalidate a ballot.<br />“Ziccarelli’s position is that Pennsylvania election law is entirely clear that voters must sign and date their mail-in ballot to be counted,” Mr. Corman said in a statement.</td>

      <td>Business groups, local governments pushed for limits on 102-year-old law</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Trump administration is removing criminal penalties for accidentally killing migratory birds, reversing longstanding federal policy in a move officials say will help landowners and businesses.<br />The final rule change, announced by the Interior Department Tuesday, completes changes proposed a year ago and in the works since 2017 to limit the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a 102-year-old law meant to protect the hundreds of bird species that are native to the U.S.<br />Business groups and local government officials have pushed for the change, saying criminal penalties are too harsh for accidental deaths.<br />But it comes at a time when bird populations are plummeting, facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.<br />Since 1970, North America has lost more than a quarter of its bird population, nearly 3 billion birds, according to research published in the journal Science in October 2019. The National Audubon Society said it recently recorded six million fewer birds in its 121st annual Christmas Bird Count than the year prior, despite record participation from counters.</td>

      <td>AL-ULA, Saudi Arabia—Qatar’s neighbors agreed Tuesday at a regional summit to set aside festering differences that had caused a destabilizing break among the U.S. allies and undermined a pressure campaign on Iran, but sidestepped efforts to resolve the sources of their repeated rifts.<br />Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt will reopen their airspace to Qatari jets, restore diplomatic ties with Doha and reverse all other actions taken since they cut relations in 2017, a senior Saudi official told The Wall Street Journal.<br />The time frame for these decisions wasn’t clear, and hours later Qatari websites remained blocked in the other countries. The official said Saudi Arabia had already begun working on implementing some of the measures, while other countries might take longer.<br />The exact terms of the deal weren’t made public, but instead were laid out in a document signed by all parties to the dispute plus the remaining members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the official said. Initial demands made of Qatar by the four countries were replaced by broad agreement on principles including nonintervention in others’ internal affairs and cooperating to confront threats to regional security.<br />“The Al-Ula declaration has achieved a settlement of all issues outstanding in a way that is entirely satisfactory to all nations involved,” Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told reporters after the gathering in the kingdom’s northwestern Al-Ula province. “All the outstanding [issues], whether it’s the returning of diplomatic relations, flights, etc., all of that will now go back to normal.”</td>

      <td>Lawmakers are set to meet in joint session Wednesday to ratify Joe Biden’s presidential win</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A group of Republican senators are zeroing in on three states as they hone their plans to object to the Electoral College vote count, pushed by President Trump to overturn the election of Democrat Joe Biden.<br />Lawmakers are set to meet in a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to certify Mr. Biden’s 306-232 electoral vote win. Both a House lawmaker and a senator need to object in writing to trigger debates and votes in both chambers on whether to disqualify a state’s electoral votes.<br />The senators’ objections are aimed at results in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania. None of the challenges are expected to succeed in the Democratic-controlled House or the GOP-run Senate, where party leaders have opposed the effort and a growing number of Republicans say they won’t join in.<br />Vice President Mike Pence is set to preside over the joint session, which will count the states in alphabetical order. While Mr. Pence’s role as president of the Senate is largely ceremonial, Mr. Trump has demanded that he intervene in the process.<br />Mr. Trump has claimed he lost the election due to widespread voter fraud, but he and his supporters have failed to present evidence that would change the outcome and have been rebuked in dozens of legal rulings. The challenge in Congress marks a last-ditch effort just two weeks from Inauguration Day.</td>
