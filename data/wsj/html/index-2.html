Shouts of “Hands up, hands up…police!” can be heard. The man appears to shoot first, breaking the driver-side window. Police then fire at the car.<br />“A tragic and difficult day is capping what’s been a tragic and difficult year,” said Mayor Jacob Frey. “Our city is experiencing a lot of raw emotion right now.”<br />Chief Medaria Arradondo said in a Thursday press conference that he had met with family members of the man who was killed by police and watched the body camera footage with them before releasing it to the public.</td>

      <td>We got through 2020 with pictures of normality in our heads. In a few months they’ll start to come true.</td>
      <td>You have to go into this year with dreams, there’s no other way to do it. We’re still in an epic struggle, and it will be a while before things settle down into some approximation of normal. Dreams are how we got through 2020, or maybe not dreams precisely but a picture you kept in your head that helped you keep going, that captured what you missed and will have again. It was a picture of When the Pandemic is Over and we carried it in our psychic wallets.<br />My friend John’s picture: He’s in Fenway Park, the seats are full and close together, and he orders a Fenway Frank and chowder, and the other people in the row pass them down without fear or masks. Someone gets a hit and no one’s afraid to cheer. He is certain this will come.<br />My friend the professor would see this: He and his students are in a room, and he is teaching them. For what seems like forever they’ve been postage-size faces on Gallery View on Zoom, which is how they see him. But in his head they’re together and know each other and he’s Mr. Chips again, not Max Headroom.<br />A friend who’s a reporter kept in her head the idea of future spontaneity. She’d be on the phone with a friend: Whatcha doin’? Wanna get in a car and get lost? What if we just show up and surprise them? Let’s see who’s in town.<br />My vision of 2021, the picture I held of that future, came into my head in early summer. This would come: We are gathered in a darkened theater, 1,500 of us, for the first time since March 2020. The orchestra starts, the curtain rises, and on the stage a crowded old railroad coach is in full cry. The train conductor booms, “River City next station stop!” And in the audience applause starts, unplanned, just erupting, and the actors playing the salesmen on the train play through. “Ya can talk-talk-talk. . . . Ya can talk all ya wanna, but it’s different than it was.” Suddenly a tall man in a natty suit comes forward: “Gentlemen, you intrigue me. I think I’ll have to give Iowa a try.” It’s Professor Harold Hill, the Music Man. He’s played by Hugh Jackman. We’re at the revival that was supposed to open in 2020. Now pent-up emotion really breaks out and what builds is a wave of unstoppable cheers, and then we can’t help it, we stand. And Mr. Jackman understands this moment, and after a minute he stops the show, and in a great flourish, as if speaking for all the history of the theater past and present, makes a deep and graceful bow. As if theater itself were bowing to all of those by whom it lives.</td>

      <td>Columbus, Ga.<br />Joe Biden won Georgia.<br />That statement isn’t as hard on Republicans’ ears as it was in early November. A hand recount that concluded Dec. 7, the Electoral College vote on Dec. 14, and the simple passing of time have made the result seem final, even among voters who doubt it.<br />But for weeks, widespread denial among Republicans obscured the result’s significance. With 49.5% of the vote to President Trump’s 49.3%, Mr. Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to carry Georgia. No Democrat since Bill Clinton had won any state in the once solidly Democratic Deep South, defined to include Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina along with the Peach State.<br />Until this year, Southern Senate delegations seemed to have undergone a similar Republican realignment. With the exception of Alabama’s Doug Jones, who edged out a scandal-plagued Republican nominee in a 2017 special election (and was soundly defeated for a full term in November), no Democrat has won a Deep South Senate seat since 2008, and not one has unseated a Republican incumbent since 1986.</td>

      <td>The latest Census population statistics show a shift from blue to red.</td>
      <td>President Trump is soon expected to submit to Congress state population counts from this year’s Census for reapportionment. Last week the Census Bureau gave a preview of what to expect, and blue-state Democrats might want to prepare their smelling salts in advance.<br />Sixteen mostly coastal and Rust Belt states lost population from July 2019 to July 2020, according to the Census Bureau’s annual population survey, and Illinois, West Virginia, New York, Connecticut, Mississippi and Vermont have shrunk since 2010. At the same time, many low-tax Sun Belt states have continued to attract newcomers.<br />The pandemic may have contributed to population losses in some states as city dwellers with means escaped to rental and vacation homes. Foreign immigration also fell after President Trump suspended new green cards in April. Some states, especially in the Northeast, experienced thousands of more deaths than usual due to Covid.<br />But the bureau’s annual population estimate captures only the first few months of the pandemic when migration generally declined as most people hunkered down. Geographic mobility increased over the summer and fall, and the pandemic seems to have accelerated migration flows that have been occurring for years. States such as New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and California have counted on foreign immigration offsetting net out-migration. That didn’t happen this year, so many states lost population for the first time in decades.<br />California’s population shrank for the first time as far back as records go (-69,532). According to a separate state government survey, a net 261,000 residents moved to other states during the period, the most in nearly 25 years. High housing costs have been driving out the middle class for years. But now many large businesses are shifting workforces to other states.</td>

      <td>The crackdown continues in Hong Kong, and this week the Chinese government made an example of the territory’s most prominent political prisoners.<br />Publisher Jimmy Lai is back in jail after Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal revoked his bail. A long-time democracy advocate and critic of the Communist Party, Mr. Lai faces multiple charges for participating in last year’s Hong Kong protests, and authorities have also charged him under the new national-security law, which effectively outlaws dissent.<br />The maximum sentence is life in prison, and there’s no guarantee that Chinese authorities won’t extradite Mr. Lai to the mainland. A lower court enraged Beijing last week when it granted bail and allowed Mr. Lai to await his trial under house arrest as long as he refrained from giving interviews, posting on social media, or making public statements.<br />The prosecution cited Article 42 of the security law, which states that no bail can be granted “unless the judge has sufficient grounds for believing the criminal suspect or defendant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.” Mr. Lai poses no such threat. He has bravely chosen not to flee despite having a British passport, and China wants to make an example of him to stifle all criticism.<br />Meanwhile on the mainland, a Shenzhen court meted out harsh sentences for 10 Hong Kongers who were arrested as they fled by boat to Taiwan. Authorities wouldn’t let these thwarted refugees meet with the lawyers hired by their families, and on Wednesday the court sentenced the 10 to between seven months and three years, almost certainly to be spent in China’s opaque and notorious prison system.</td>

      <td>Whether or not they make it to the Super Bowl, the Buffalo Bills have already pulled off a miracle victory: persuading New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to let 6,700 fans attend their playoff game next weekend.<br />The Bills have won the AFC East division for the first time in 25 years and will host their first home playoff game since 1996. Buffalo could use the morale boost. It sure hasn’t received one from the billions of dollars Mr. Cuomo has spent trying to revive the western New York economy.<br />Mr. Cuomo has kept Bill fans locked out of the stadium all season, though 13 other NFL stadiums have allowed limited numbers to attend games. There has been only one report of a fan testing positive after an NFL game. Yet in November Mr. Cuomo proclaimed it would be “reckless” to let any fans into a stadium that could seat nearly 72,000.<br />Perhaps feeling the holiday spirit or pressure from upstate voters, Mr. Cuomo has reversed course. “We’re all feeling the excitement,” Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday. “We’ve all wanted the Buffalo Bills to be good, it’s been a long time, and that team has a charisma and personality that is infectious.”<br />The Governor’s plan requires all fans to be tested before the game and wear masks. The state also plans to hold drive-through rapid testing at the stadium, which he says would be a pilot for reopening businesses and live events.</td>

      <td>An audit in one county finds no fraud, but it puts officials on notice.</td>
      <td>Georgia’s audit of the November mail vote in Cobb County found “no fraudulent absentee ballots.” In a report Tuesday, the Secretary of State’s office explained how investigators double checked the signatures on 15,118 randomly chosen ballot envelopes. It’s a good warning to anybody contemplating shenanigans in Georgia’s Senate runoffs next week.<br />About 150,000 people in Cobb County voted by mail, so the sample was nearly 10% of the total. Most of the accepted signatures were clearly valid. Investigators ended up with 10 suspect envelopes. On eight of them, the signature “did not appear to be consistent with documents on record.” But once the voters were contacted, they confirmed the signatures were theirs. Handwriting can change, especially as people age.<br />That left two problem votes. One was missing a signature, and the voter “reported signing the front of the envelope only.” The other ballot was correctly voted, but then its envelope was “mistakenly signed by the elector’s spouse.” In both cases, the state said, Cobb County should have asked the voter to fix the mistake before accepting the ballot.<br />These are ordinary screw ups, not the mass fraud that President Trump claims. Two bad ballots out of 15,118 is an error rate of 0.013%. If you extrapolate that to Georgia’s 1,316,943 mail votes, it suggests 174 questionable ballots statewide. There are reasons to roll back mail voting, which could be a debacle if the margin were closer. But Mr. Trump lost Georgia by 12,000.<br />It’s good news that no fraud was found, yet some Trump supporters appear unwilling to accept defeat no matter the evidence. They include Mr. Trump, who tweeted: “When are we going to be allowed to do signature verification in Fulton County, Georgia?” The big difference is that in Cobb County a temporary election worker made a specific allegation to investigate.</td>

      <td>The Trump administration undermined the public-health response to Covid-19.</td>
      <td>Scott Atlas’s op-ed “A Pandemic of Misinformation” (Dec. 22) contributes to the problem he laments. He writes that states directed their own pandemic policies, with governors and local officials responsible for outcomes. A lack of leadership from the White House left them no other choice. For example, Washington’s Opening Up America Again guidelines were well-received, but the administration promptly ignored them, pushing states to open before reaching important health benchmarks.<br />Jared Kushner relayed President Trump’s posture to Bob Woodward: The states would be responsible for the public-health burden while he’d own the reopening. “The opening is going to be very popular,” Mr. Kushner said.<br />An October Gallup report concluded that “the most important factor in Americans’ decision to [take Covid precautions seriously] is exposure to accurate information about the pandemic from sources they trust.” Mr. Trump played down Covid’s seriousness, belittled masks, flaunted CDC guidelines and ran a White House that became a Covid epicenter. The government’s investment in vaccines must be applauded. Otherwise, its actions fell short.<br />David Stone<br />Birmingham, Mich.</td>

      <td>More stimulus, more federal ‘investments’ in favored industries and state and local governments, more regulations and higher taxes.</td>
      <td>William A. Galston tees up Washington’s next massive stimulus package as essential to avoid a double-dip recession (“Can Team Biden Prevent a Recession?” Politics & Ideas, Dec. 23). Mr. Galston is concerned that “the pace of job growth has declined for five straight months and may have ceased in December.” Normal cyclical forces could be swamped by “structural changes” that were accelerated by the pandemic.<br />This may be unsettling, but the pace of job growth was destined to fall after a fairly rapid recovery from an extraordinary spike in job losses. Compare this with the 2007-09 recession. The unemployment rate peaked around 10% nine months into President Obama’s first year and didn’t drop to 6.7% for 50 months until December 2013. In 2020 the unemployment rate soared to nearly 15% in April and dropped to 6.7% only seven months later in November.<br />Secular stagnation was the excuse made for eight years of modest growth and slow labor-market recovery under Mr. Obama’s stewardship. It seems that Mr. Biden’s will be structural changes, but one guesses his solutions will be similar. Washington will pick up the economic slack with more stimulus, more federal “investments” in favored industries and state and local governments, more regulations and higher taxes.<br />How many trillions of dollars of federal spending will it take to get back to President Trump’s prepandemic unemployment rate of 3.5%? The rate didn’t get below 4.7% during the Obama-Biden years. Let’s hope the Biden-Harris solution isn’t to hire five million more federal workers.<br />Ryan Graham</td>

Louie Gohmert of Texas, a “walking legal contradiction” because it takes aim at the vice president, “ironically the very person whose power they seek to promote.”<br />The lawsuit, filed by Mr. Gohmert and a number of Republicans in Arizona, challenges the procedures governing Congress’ counting of electoral votes next week, which will cement Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.<br />Those long-established measures, spelled out in the Electoral Count Act of 1887, say the vice president’s role in announcing the election results is purely ceremonial. Mr. Gohmert argued the process unconstitutionally binds Mr. Pence from exercising “exclusive authority” to determine which elector votes to count at the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress he oversees.<br />The Justice Department suggested that Mr. Gohmert might instead sue Congress itself, since the 1887 law vests the legislature with powers they are seeking to transfer to Mr. Pence.</td>

Ms. Yellen began consulting for the firm one year after leaving her post as Federal Reserve chairwoman in early 2018.<br />The agreement said Ms. Yellen would seek special authorization for one year when dealing with matters pertaining to Magellan, according to forms posted online by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.<br />The agreement outlines similar steps she would take for 16 additional financial firms or entities from which she collected speaking fees in the past year, including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,   Citigroup  Inc.  and hedge-fund firm Citadel LLC. Those measures would be in place until one year after the speaking fee was paid.<br />Like many former government officials, Ms. Yellen signed a contract shortly after leaving the Fed with the Washington Speakers Bureau, an agency that helps former heads of state and other political personalities manage scores of speaking requests. Ms. Yellen has spoken frequently since leaving the central bank on the economic outlook and monetary policy, a topic of intense interest to Wall Street firms that closely follow the Fed.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for secretary of state took a high-dollar foray into international consulting and venture capital during the Trump administration, a career move that followed long years in public service in the White House, State Department and halls of Congress, according to financial disclosures released Thursday.<br />Tony Blinken, seen as likely to be confirmed as chief diplomat in January, is co-founder and managing partner at a consulting firm that includes other former officials from the Obama administration’s national security team. The firm, WestExec Advisors LLC, paid him $1.2 million, not including an expected payment of between $250,000 and $500,000 for 2020, according to the disclosures, filed through the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.<br />Meanwhile, Avril Haines, Mr. Biden’s selection for director of national intelligence, has an extensive résumé that includes consulting work with national-security data analysis company  Palantir Technologies Inc.  and WestExec Advisors, and as a fellow at the nonpartisan public policy research organization Brookings Institution. Ms. Haines has resigned from those posts and says she will recuse herself from all business with them for one year. The bulk of her income comes from her position as a research scholar and lecturer at Columbia University, where she was paid a salary of $440,121.<br />The disclosures demonstrate what has long been a pattern in Washington: Senior officials from one political party find private work in their areas of expertise during an administration led by a president from the other party, in this case President Trump’s Republican Party. Companies and investors have eagerly sought strategic advice from veteran Washington lawyers and consultants as they navigated political and policy changes in the Trump administration, and former officials with international experience were useful in grappling with tariffs and new attitudes toward international deals, U.S. allies and China.<br />Mr. Blinken and Ms. Haines will face questions about their work in hearings expected in early 2021. The Senate is expected to announce the schedules for confirmation hearings for Mr. Blinken, Ms. Haines and others soon after the Georgia Senate runoff, which will determine partisan control of the Senate, according to a person familiar with the planning. Typically, hearings for key posts occur ahead of the inauguration to have key national security posts ready for a final confirmation on Jan. 20, the day of the ceremony. In 2017, the Senate confirmed Jim Mattis as secretary of defense and John Kelly as head of the Department of Homeland Security on the same day President Trump was sworn in.</td>

      <td>Renewal of a policy criticized by businesses leaves incoming Biden administration with another immigration dilemma</td>
      <td><br />The White House extended a ban on immigrants coming to the U.S. on work-based visas and green cards through the end of March, setting up another immigration policy decision for the incoming Biden administration to grapple with.<br />President Trump issued bans in April and in June in the name of protecting American workers from foreign competition, just as shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic were battering the economy. The ban, which had been set to expire on Thursday, applies to immigrants coming to the U.S. on H-1B and several other employment-based visas, along with people coming on green cards to work or reunite with family.<br />The ban on work-based visas in particular was roundly criticized by Silicon Valley and other U.S. companies that said they depend on the visas to bring employees into industries ranging from tech and consulting to landscaping and seasonal jobs at resorts.<br />In October, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents a broad cross-section of these industries, won a partial injunction on the visa ban in court, allowing its member companies to resume bringing over foreign employees. It isn’t known how the ban extension will affect the court’s order.</td>

      <td>Case filings have fallen in most categories beginning in March, according to report on federal judiciary</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts closed out 2020 by recounting the federal judiciary’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, a public-health emergency that disrupted the justice system from traffic court to the marble edifice of the high court itself.<br />Federal judges and the court system’s support staff have adopted remote hearings, installed plexiglass barriers in courtrooms and taken many other steps to continue work while reducing the risk of infection, the chief justice wrote in his year-end report on the federal judiciary.<br />“District judges are privileged to perform naturalization ceremonies and welcome new citizens. But the coronavirus has made it difficult to conduct traditional court-house ceremonies safely,” the chief justice wrote in the report, an annual summary published each Dec. 31.<br />“So judges in Michigan and Florida held drive-through naturalizations. Others, in Iowa and Minnesota, moved the ceremonies outdoors,” he wrote, “borrowing a practice from a century ago, when San Francisco courts held proceedings outdoors during the Spanish flu pandemic.”<br />The high court sent employees to work from home in March, and in May began hearing cases by teleconference, a practice that continues. But the coronavirus, the chief justice observed, wasn’t the first pathogen to disrupt the Supreme Court’s work.</td>

      <td>Politicians and media pundits have often blamed the population density of New York City for the country’s highest per capita Covid death tolls in New Jersey and New York. Now they need to explain the slow pace of vaccinations.<br />Around two out of every thousand people in New York and New Jersey have died with Covid this year, roughly double the rate in Florida and Texas. By placing strict limits on individual liberty while also failing to prioritize the protection of the elderly, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D.) has achieved the ignominy of presiding over both the highest per capita Covid death rate and the nation’s highest unemployment rate.<br />It’s a remarkable occurrence that New Jersey joblessness exceeds even the pain in states like Hawaii and Nevada which rely heavily on the hospitality and travel industries. New Jersey’s unemployment rate is also much higher than Florida’s. Across the Hudson River from the Garden State, New York’s grim stats have been almost as awful as New Jersey’s. Maybe it’s all about the highly populated metro area.<br />One might assume that population density would be more help than hindrance in a vaccination campaign, but according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control, New Jersey and New York have barely been able to climb to the level of mediocrity.<br />The vaccination effort has only recently begun and perhaps reporting lags around the holidays are obscuring the full story. But so far the national leader in administering Covid vaccinations is West Virginia.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D.)  can learn from the Mountain State example.</td>

      <td>First, California banned the sale of gas-powered cars after the year 2035. Then it got car companies to sign on to its own tough emission standards. It’s obvious what’s next, isn’t it? California will become the first state to mandate that by 2035, cars must cease to be visually interchangeable.<br />“You’ve got the Accord that looks like the Camry that looks like the Sonata, and this just has to stop,” says a high-ranking state official. “It’s incredibly boring to get on the 101 and drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco and maybe see three cars that don’t look like every other car. And it makes it harder to catch speeders, because all the cars look the same.”<br />“It’s really bad with vans,” adds a second, more medium-ranking official. “Car companies developed a couple of basic designs in the 1990s, and they’ve stuck with them. A van that rolled off the assembly line in 2004 doesn’t look much different than one you bought yesterday. I know. I bought one in 2004.”<br />Car companies agree that their products suffer from a pitiful uniformity. They nod remorsefully that it would be nicer for everyone if cars were not so bland, generic, sleep-inducing. Then they point out, with some pique, that aerodynamic and structural innovations intended to make cars more fuel-efficient and safer are largely to blame.<br />“Look, you’re basically dealing with a rectangular-shaped box,” says one Motor City CEO. “Short of adding Nifty Fifties fins or running boards or some kind of weird sunroof or turret, there’s just no way to make one car look different from every other car.”</td>

A Beijing-based drug-development unit of China National Pharmaceutical Group Co., known more commonly as Sinopharm, said earlier Wednesday that its shot was found to be 79% effective in protecting against Covid-19 in interim Phase 3 clinical trials overseas.<br />The vaccine, along with two other homegrown candidates, was earlier approved for emergency use in China. Beijing grants conditional approvals for vaccines that haven’t completed clinical trials if it is deemed to be urgent to cope with public health emergencies. The new approval is the first allowing for broader use of a coronavirus vaccine in the country.<br />Sinopharm has started mass production of the newly approved vaccine, Mao Junfeng, an official at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said Thursday.<br />Drugmakers must still submit final results after they receive conditional approval. Mr. Chen, the regulatory official, said authorities will keep a close eye on Sinopharm to ensure it carries out its Phase 3 trial as planned.</td>

Later sequencing of her positive test revealed it was different from a small outbreak of cases in Shanghai in November and the strains from Wuhan, where Covid-19 was first found.<br />The patient’s case of Covid-19 was diagnosed as mild, the paper said, noting that several control measures were taken to isolate the woman and identify those who sat near her or dealt with her on the flight.</td>

      <td>The author of the National Book Award-winning ‘Interior Chinatown’ wittily explores the complexities of immigration and the trajectory of today’s Asian-Americans</td>
      <td>Raised by Taiwanese immigrants in Los Angeles, Charles Yu grew up trusting that American society was on a steady march toward greater racial harmony. With each new generation in the U.S., he says, “I always thought there was a progression toward inclusion.”<br />But the 45-year-old novelist is no longer so sure that applies to Asian-Americans. His second novel, “Interior Chinatown” (2020), which won the National Book Award for fiction last November, examines why some Chinese and other Asian immigrants and their children still feel confined to stereotypes and secondary roles in the U.S. Italian and Irish immigrants were reviled at first but eventually became part of mainstream U.S. society. But the main character in Mr. Yu’s novel, a Chinese-American actor named Willis Wu, struggles to find an answer to his question: “After two centuries here, why are we still not Americans? Why do we keep falling out of the story?”<br />Over the past several years, Mr. Yu has found it harder to feel optimistic about prospects for Asian-Americans. The election of President Trump in 2016 signaled a growing hostility to immigrants of all kinds, he says. Meanwhile, China is increasingly viewed as America’s most dangerous rival, and Mr. Trump has branded Covid-19 as the “China virus.”<br />Mr. Yu’s own winding road to literary stardom seems like an affirmation of the opportunities that can await immigrants and their children in the U.S. “My experience is probably just about as good as you can really come by,” but it is far from universal and filled with complexity, he says. For most of his life, Mr. Yu has felt fully American, but he has received repeated reminders that others see him differently. At one literary event, a comedian mocked him and the other Asian-American participant as interchangeable.<br />“There’s a mismatch between how I feel inside and how I look on the outside,” Mr. Yu says. In “Interior Chinatown,” the protagonist thinks, “You are Asian! Your brain forgets sometimes. But then your face reminds you.”</td>

      <td>A radiant entertainer finally gets her due as a composer and lyricist—and champion of resilience amid troubles.</td>
      <td>In the late 1960s, Dolly Parton got her big break as the “girl singer” on “The Porter Wagoner Show,” a syndicated television program that brought hard-core honky-tonk and down-home humor into the living rooms of America. It may be hard to believe now, but back then Ms. Parton was only the second most flamboyant performer onstage. One of country music’s most magnetic stars, Wagoner had a peroxide pompadour and eye-popping, rhinestone-studded Nudie suits that defined Nashville glitz. Meanwhile, “Miss Dolly,” as he called her, was kept buttoned up in demure outfits despite her natural radiance and zest.<br />Underpaid and underappreciated, Ms. Parton would later compare her seven-year stint with Wagoner to the time that indentured servants were required to work in order to earn their freedom. It was indeed a raw deal, but it was worth it. It gave her national exposure and performing experience with a peerless entertainer twice her age. It also allowed her to hone her songwriting talent, which had brought her to Nashville in 1964 as an 18-year-old from the Smoky Mountains.<br />One day, as the Wagoner tour bus headed to the next town, something caught Ms. Parton’s fancy. “We rode past Dover, Tennessee, and my mind started going,” she recalls in “Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics” (Chronicle, 376 pages, $50). “There was this field of clover waving in the wind. So there we were, Dover-clover, and that started me off: ‘The sun behind a cloud just cast a crawling shadow o’er the fields of clover. And time is running out for me. I wish that he would hurry down from Dover.’ ”<br />The verses that flowed from this roadside epiphany told a story from the point of view of a pregnant girl deserted by her lover and abandoned by her scandalized parents. Alone but still hoping for her lover’s return, she decides to have the baby, which is stillborn. With its Southern Gothic overtones, “Down From Dover” evokes the dark fatalism of the mountain ballads that Ms. Parton heard as a child. Its subject matter was taboo for country radio when it appeared on a 1970 album, so “Dover” was never the hit that she thought it could be. But it remains a favorite of Ms. Parton and many of her fans, and it has enjoyed an afterlife as one of her most covered songs, not only by country singers (Skeeter Davis) but also by campy pop sirens (Nancy Sinatra) and New Wave chanteuses (Marianne Faithfull).<br />“Down From Dover” is one of 175 Parton compositions over a six-decade career featured in “Songteller,” a lavishly illustrated compendium of annotated lyrics and back-story anecdotes. The songs range freely across genres, from classic country weepers to proto-feminist hits like “Just Because I’m a Woman” to frothy upbeat pop crossovers; from stark acoustic bluegrass and movie-soundtrack blockbusters like “9 to 5” and “I Will Always Love You” to Broadway show tunes. It is only a portion of Dolly Parton’s staggering output of 450 recorded songs.</td>

      <td>Louis Kahn (1901-1974) was indisputably one of the greatest architects of the 20th century. When Kahn showed Philip Johnson, the founder of the Museum of Modern Art’s architecture and design department, the drawings for his breakthrough Richards Medical Research Laboratories at the University of Pennsylvania, Johnson responded: “When this building is done you’ll be the most prominent architect in the country and we’ll give it a show at the Museum.”<br />The show opened in 1961 and Kahn, then entering his 60s, was finally launched. Further successes followed quickly. Just a few years after designing the Richards, Kahn became a prisoner of international airport lounges, jetsetting among commissions in India, East and West Pakistan (now Bangladesh and Pakistan), Israel and the United States. He reeled off a string of masterpieces, including the Kimbell Art Museum (Fort Worth, Texas), the Salk Institute (La Jolla, Calif.) and the library at Phillips Exeter Academy (Exeter, N.H.).<br />Kahn’s reputation is unshakable, and yet three recently published books illuminate lingering questions about his life and work. What transformed a standard-issue modernist into a creative force of indomitable originality in his mid-50s? And how should we understand Kahn’s vastly complicated personal life?<br />Furthermore, what about Kahn’s gnomic utterances, of which the best known is “ ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ ” Was Kahn a true sage, as John Lobell argues in “Louis Kahn: Architecture as Philosophy” (Monacelli, 195 pages, $50), or just a bushwa artist conning the eggheads at Yale and Penn, where he taught?<br />Builder; philanderer; philosopher. We are slowly assembling the story of Louis Kahn, the man in full.</td>

In his teens, Schaeffer became partners with his surrogate father in both professions. In “Eddie’s Boy” (Mysterious Press, 274 pages, $26), an unanticipated but welcome series entry, Schaeffer is 60, retired and living low-profile in England with his titled wife.<br />Schaeffer’s violent past catches up to him every decade or two, in the form of professional assassins bent on collecting payoffs from retributive mobsters. At the start of “Eddie’s Boy,” Schaeffer is forced to deal with a quartet of thugs who come after him one evening in his wife’s ancestral home. The chillingly focused Schaeffer kills the assailants with a minimum of fuss and an absence of emotion—then apologizes to his wife: “I’m sorry for all the noise and commotion.” His spouse, privy to her husband’s past, responds: “You know, Michael, you’re not thirty anymore. Maybe we could ask some men we trust to help out.” Schaeffer prefers not to involve others. He does take his wife’s suggestion that he lay low in Australia for a while, though he reflects: “They both knew that it was unlikely he’d live to return home one more time.”<br />But Schaeffer was well-trained by his mentor: “Eddie had taught him how to be the one who survived.” Before he can catch his departing flight, however, he feels compelled to kill two men who are shadowing him at the airport. After landing in Sydney, he overpowers another group of attackers on the train into the city. Schaeffer realizes hiding is no longer an option. Who specifically, though, wishes him eliminated? “There were plenty of suspects. . . . He could think of about twenty men.”<br />Few authors write action sequences, build suspense and spring surprises as well as Mr. Perry. And few readers will expect anyone who’s roused Schaeffer’s alarm to escape his fatal attentions. In an attempt to find out who wants him dead, Schaeffer next travels to the U.S., to the Virginia home of Elizabeth Waring, an official in the Justice Department’s Organized Crime Section, with whom he’s had previous dealings. His proposal: If she tells him who’s after him, he’ll give her information on unsolved mob murders she can bring to belated trial.<br />Waring does get some useful facts out of Schaeffer, as she tries to convince him to enter witness-protection and spend the rest of his life testifying against indicted mobsters. But Schaeffer won’t go that far; instead, he engineers ingenious, deadly traps into which he lures his enemies. “It’s not a duel,” Schaeffer says of his current predicament. “It’s more like a hunt. I’m the wolf. . . . No matter how things go, the deer doesn’t get to eat the wolf.”</td>

      <td>A memoir of encounters with literary greats, and the strange labor of the writer’s craft.</td>
      <td>Dana Gioia writes that, by the time he went to college in the early 1970s, he had “already developed a deep suspicion of all theories of art that did not originate in pleasure.” To help build on this sensible foundation, he had the good fortune, during his student days, to encounter some of the leading literary figures of the time. In his final semester as a graduate student at Harvard in 1975, Mr. Gioia was presented with a choice of teachers: Robert Lowell, then at the height of his fame, or Elizabeth Bishop, not well known and often spoken of as a Lowell protégée. Lowell’s seminar on 19th-century poetry was much in demand. “Everyone who fancied himself a poet talked about taking it,” Mr. Gioia writes. As for Bishop’s course on contemporary verse: “I had never heard anyone mention it at all.”<br />The words come from the first of the six short memoirs in this highly enjoyable book. In addition to his classes with Bishop, Mr. Gioia recalls his encounters with John Cheever, whose wit and idiosyncratic wisdom light up each of the 50 or so pages on which he features; Robert Fitzgerald, translator of Homer and Virgil and a fierce defender of metrical forms; the wild-man poet and novelist James Dickey, to whom Mr. Gioia had once given a poor review in an obscure magazine, which turned out to be neither forgotten nor forgiven; and two people unknown in the literary world—an uncle who passed on a love of books to his nephew and a little-published poet, Ronald Perry, whom Mr. Gioia had encouraged during an exchange of letters and who died unexpectedly on the eve of their planned first meeting.<br />To these six must be added the author’s younger self, about whom he writes as engagingly as he writes about anyone else. Mr. Gioia was raised among “a tight enclave of Sicilian relations” in a working-class home in Hawthorne, Calif. None of them read much. He made an early decision to be not only “among the poets,” as Keats put it, but of that minority who have jobs in the larger world—in his case as an executive at General Foods. Mr. Gioia’s achievements are said to include a reversal of the decline in sales of Jell-O. In a brief postscript, he describes his efforts to keep his literary life hidden while he was there. “Whenever something of mine appeared in the New Yorker, I would discreetly buy all five copies in the company shop, mail one to my parents, and slip the others into the bottom of the finance department’s bulging recycling bin.”<br />Elizabeth Bishop’s approach to teaching makes the reader long to be transported back to the mid-1970s, to sit in her class. After all, there was no shortage of places. She began by asking the dozen or so students who were denied the opportunity to study with Lowell to propose “three or four poets they would like to read and talk about. Does anyone have a suggestion?”<br />Someone mentioned John Ashbery, then beginning his ascent to what John Berryman used to refer to as “No. 1.” Bishop brushed the notion aside. “Oh no, we can’t read Ashbery. I wouldn’t know what to say about him.” W.H. Auden was likewise dismissed, on the eccentric grounds that “We just read him in my other class.” The poets she liked talking about most before Mr. Gioia and his fellows were William Carlos Williams and Wallace Stevens (two other poets with day jobs, as it happens: one as a doctor, the other as an insurance executive).</td>

      <td>A word-besotted tale of dictionary-makers, a satire by André Gide and a soul-baring novel about a family’s choice.</td>
      <td>‘What would be in your personal dictionary?” asks a character in Eley Williams’s “The Liar’s Dictionary” (Doubleday, 270 pages, $26.95), and the question will resonate with anyone who has ever felt that language doesn’t sufficiently furnish them with words to match their daily experiences. What Mallory, the novel’s narrator, would like is “a word for knowing when the pasta is perfectly cooked just by looking at it”; “a word for mispronouncing words that you had only ever seen written down”; “a word for being surprised by an aspect of your physicality.” Nothing is more individualized than the act of naming. How maddening that we’re limited to the words that have been deemed appropriate for general usage.<br />In Ms. Williams’s entertaining office-place whodunit, the personalized reference book is no longer just a dream. Mallory is an intern at Swansby’s New Encyclopaedic Dictionary, an erstwhile competitor to the Oxford English Dictionary that has since been forgotten. Swansby’s heir wants all its files digitized for posterity but he faces an awkward problem: The volumes appear to be filled with fake words. Mallory’s impossible task is to find and excise all the fabrications. Meanwhile, alternating chapters set in turn-of-the-century London follow a transformative day in the life of Peter Winceworth, a wallflower researcher who works in the Swansby “Scrivenery.”<br />While bringing the storylines to a convergence, Ms. Williams indulges in delightful digressions. Dictionaries have a rich history with phony words, it happens—known as “mountweazels,” they were included to guard against plagiarists. Mallory discovers that the Swansby’s mountweazels give her some idea of the personality of the rogue lexicographer who snuck them in. (“Mammonsomniate (v.), to dream that money might make anything possible.”) A sense of subjectivity and error begins to creep into the meanings of things. Underneath this novel’s extremely bookish mystery is the idea that our identities are as improvisatory as the words we affix to them, and that even the dictionary, the most seemingly staid and impartial arbiter of truth, is an “unreliable narrator.”<br />In André Gide’s novel “Marshlands” (NYRB, 116 pages, $14.95), the narrator is a writer struggling to write a book called “Marshlands,” about a man living alone in a tower surrounded by swamps whose futile existence expresses the “boredom, vanity, [and] monotony” of the narrator’s life. When not writing his book, the narrator looks for material to add to it—that is, he persists in the desultory routine of pontificating about it to unappreciative friends, establishing a perfectly recursive circle in which life and art reinforce the same “useless contemplation.” The upside, though, is that the narrator gets to feel intellectually superior about his pointlessness. Considering a philistine acquaintance, he grouses that the man “cannot accept that an author, writing not to instruct, may still not be writing to entertain.”<br />Gide published “Marshlands” in 1895 and sporadically revised it and commented upon it throughout his lifetime, as if trying to puzzle out just what he was getting after. That he was writing to entertain there is no doubt, and as a satire of the self-important aesthete the book is witty and frequently hilarious. (The narrator’s meticulously updated daily planner includes items such as “Ten o’clock. Go explain to Magloire why I think he’s such a jerk.”) But is there instruction, as well? In a journal entry decades later, Gide called his narrator an “agitated agitator” whose role is to sow unrest by awakening people to the “sordid apathy” of their existences. It’s true that the wallowing author is only able to complete “Marshlands” once he has succeeded in transferring some of his despair to his longsuffering girlfriend: “Wait! What? Now you’re crying. —Good! I am happy! I act!”</td>

      <td>Makeup sellers like Sephora and Ulta must walk a fine line between stores and e-commerce</td>
      <td>Some things are just a tough sell online. Traditionally, makeup and fragrances have fallen squarely in the category of goods that consumers want to sample in person. Yet even this industry might not be immune to the pandemic’s effects on consumer behavior.<br />Major department stores like  Nordstrom  and  Macy’s  got around a quarter of sales through e-commerce channels in the fiscal year ended Feb. 1. Cosmetics retailer  Ulta Beauty ,  however, derived only 13% of its sales online.<br />Yet e-commerce sales are growing fast at Ulta: by 200% in the quarter ended Aug. 1 compared with a year earlier. Even when stores had fully reopened, online sales were up 90%, hinting at some e-commerce stickiness.<br />This might pose a dilemma for beauty retailers. Push hard on e-commerce and they risk making consumers too comfortable with online shopping, potentially lowering the barrier for online competition and rendering their store fleets obsolete. A similar dynamic has played out with apparel, for example, as newer competitors flooded the market, notes Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.<br />On the surface, Ulta Beauty’s decision to place its shops inside Target stores and Sephora’s plan to set up inside Kohl’s department stores look like bets on traditional bricks-and-mortar. But look more closely and they are also smart hedges against an online future. These setups require less resources than stand-alone stores and also include an online component, as  Target  and  Kohl’s  will be showcasing Ulta Beauty and Sephora products on their websites.</td>

      <td>With airlines in the West expecting to take years to recover from Covid-19, aircraft manufacturers depend on the resilience and growth potential of the Chinese market. But China’s own aerospace ambitions and the geopolitical tensions that surround them could make it a turbulent ride.<br />China has recovered from the pandemic to become the world’s largest domestic aviation market. Traffic is 8% higher than a year ago, data by Oliver Wyman’s PlaneStats show. In the U.S. and Europe, it is still down 41% and 68%, respectively.<br />With another 500 million Chinese expected to join the middle classes over the next few years, the country is also the industry’s big growth opportunity. The International Air Transport Association predicts 5% average annual growth in passenger journeys in the Asia-Pacific region between 2019 and 2039. Mature Western markets are expected to expand at a 2.2% rate.<br />Following a mild liberalization of its airline industry in 2004, China has become the second largest source of revenues for the two major plane makers,  Boeing  and  Airbus ,  which have since opened plants there. It is one of their few bright spots too: In November, Boeing downgraded its 20-year global aircraft demand forecast by 2%, but upgraded China’s by 6.3% to 8,600 planes.<br />Relative to the rest of the world, China is especially important for the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, which are the backbone of low-cost airlines. It has accounted for a quarter of deliveries for the 737 MAX, which Boeing is scrambling to remarket after a 20-month grounding.</td>

      <td>Selected by Celia Paul, author of the memoir ’Self-Portrait.’</td>
      <td>Edited by Ceridwen Lloyd-Morgan (2004)<br />1. The Welsh painter Gwen John had a passionate relationship with the sculptor Auguste Rodin, who was 36 years her senior. Describing the details of the affair to her friend Ursula, she writes: “I had a visit from Rodin yesterday morning and still feel rather faint after it. As you thought, he likes to make me furious, or at least it seems so.” She also wrote about her lover in her notebooks: “Today I woke unwell. I have hurried dreadfully to meet R. He did not come.” The voice of her letters is frank: “I don’t pretend to know anybody well. People are like shadows to me.” Her life was filled with shadows—her melancholy paintings were full of them. Nonetheless, throughout the tempestuous affair with Rodin, and others in her later life, Gwen John remained committed to her art—that is, to the production of paintings of ever greater intensity.<br />By Augustus John (1952)<br />2. Augustus John painted all the most famous people of his time. In his memoir, he describes them with a portraitist’s insight. Oscar Wilde is “an easy-going sort of genius, with an enormous sense of fun, infallible bad taste, gleams of profundity and a romantic apprehension of the Devil.” D.H. Lawrence “made a point of compensating himself for his physical drawbacks by a dazzling display of cerebral fireworks. Originality or Death seemed to be his motto.” Further, John writes, “Amedeo Modigliani was normally a charming man, but he was rarely normal. His habit of chewing hempseed, if it inflamed his imagination, distorted it as well.” Of Gwen John, his sister, we learn, her “apparent timidity and evasiveness disguised a lofty pride. . . . She was capable of a degree of exaltation combined with ruthlessness which, like a pointed pistol, compelled surrender: but the pistol would be pointed at herself.”<br />Edited by Anna Gruetzner Robins (2000)</td>

      <td>Gary D. Schmidtdoes something delightful in “Just Like That” (Clarion, 385 pages, $16.99), a novel for readers ages 9-14. He arranges for his characters to discover great books—“Treasure Island,” “Oliver Twist” and “The Wonderful World of Oz” among them—even as he borrows ideas and personality types from great books for the story he is telling about his characters. In this way, Mr. Schmidt’s tale of two young people and their journeys from darkness to light becomes, in itself, a testament to the formative power of literature.<br />“Just Like That” is set in and around 1968, and at first there are two strands to it. The first belongs to Meryl Lee Kowalski, who’s reeling from the accidental death of her best friend and has just arrived for eighth grade at St. Elene’s Preparatory Academy in Maine. Here, in the manner of many a boarding-school tale, she encounters snooty classmates, demanding teachers, and the endless temptation to go out of bounds.<br />The tone is arch and the words often capitalized in Meryl Lee’s part of the story. She imagines that the school’s headmistress, Dr. Nora MacKnockater, exudes Awful Dignity. She and her classmates at St. Elene’s Preparatory Academy, as it is always named, archly and in full, know that it is their mission to develop Resolution, overcome Obstacles and become Accomplished.<br />There’s not much humor in the novel’s second strand, which attaches to Matt Coffin, an illiterate boy more or less Meryl Lee’s age. Enslaved by a gang of pickpockets in New York City for most of his childhood, the traumatized Matt has lately escaped with a bag of loot. When Dr. MacKnockater discovers the boy living in a tumbledown shack near her house, she begins to gentle him, feeding him meatloaf and chowder and Robert Louis Stevenson. But it’s only a matter of time before the homicidal gang boss, a Dickensian villain named Leonidas Shug, tracks him down. Matt knows it, and we know it.<br />The two story-strands come together midway in a scene that captures the book’s dichotomous mood. On Thanksgiving, hearing someone at the door of Dr. MacKnockater’s house, where he’s staying, Matt rushes down wearing only boxers and brandishing a hatchet. He is prepared to kill Leonidas Shug. Instead he finds Meryl Lee, a girl who, like Dorothy in Oz, has embarked on a journey that will take place as much within her as without.</td>

      <td>From the Bauhaus to Black Mountain, the Albers inspired each other—and a generation of artists.</td>
      <td>The 20th century produced its fair share of powerhouse artist couples, among them Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O’Keeffe, Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock, Helen Frankenthaler and Robert Motherwell, and Willem and Elaine de Kooning. But for sheer longevity and high-voltage aesthetic give-and-take, none rivals the union of Josef and Anni Albers, who met at the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany, arrived in the U.S. to teach at Black Mountain College in 1933, and were married for 51 happy and productive years.<br />Numerous books and exhibitions have covered the career of Josef Albers, famed for both his teaching and his rigorous brand of geometric abstraction; fewer have been devoted to the accomplishments of Anni, whose weavings elevated simple craftsmanship to sublime and often monumental statements. No biographer considered the two in tandem until Nicholas Fox Weber published a slim volume about their furniture, textiles and other works in 2004. Now he has written “Anni & Josef Albers: Equal and Unequal”—a mammoth, profusely illustrated doorstopper of a book.<br />Mr. Weber, the author of biographies of Balthus and Le Corbusier, is in an intimate position to present the Alberses as individual artists and married partners—“fiercely ‘independent’ and ‘interdependent’ to rare effect,” as he describes them. He met and became close to the couple in the early 1970s when he was a graduate student at Yale, where Josef was teaching, and since 1979 he has been the head of the foundation that bears the couple’s name.<br />Mr. Weber’s approach in this book is not so much straightforward biography as a smorgasbord of chapters, long and short, detailing the artists’ lives but also examining their relationships with students, collectors, mathematical systems, pre-Columbian art, Duccio and Giotto, Paul Klee and Marcel Breuer (among others), along with the couple’s own tastes in dress, furnishings and even food. With its staggering array of photos and reproductions, this is a book meant to be browsed and savored rather than read straight through.<br />Given their dissimilar backgrounds and an age difference of 11 years, it seems a lucky accident of spontaneous combustion that Anni and Josef should connect at the Bauhaus, that legendary experimental institution for teaching art and design. Josef was the son of a devoutly Catholic painter-decorator in Bottrop, in the northwestern industrial Ruhr region; he worked as an elementary-school teacher before enrolling as a student at the Bauhaus at the age of 32. Anni, born Annelise Elsa Frieda Fleischman, was from a prosperous Jewish family in Berlin; her father “sold expensive dressers and sofas from his vast Art Nouveau showrooms to the swells of Berlin,” Mr. Weber reports, while her uncles “lived in the most impressive mansions in the city [and] all had their clothes custom-made for appearances in the best seats at the opera or for carriage rides from one of their fabulous residences to another.” Anni would soon reject the life of privilege and excess, as she did her artistic education up until that point, whether from her art teacher, a second-generation German Impressionist named Martin Brandenburg, or the instruction she received at the School of Applied Arts, where they taught what she called “sissy stuff, mainly needlepoint.”</td>

Suddenly, the usual ways of doing things were no longer an option. Governments and businesses scrambled to develop new protocols, and we all struggled to reinvent the activities of everyday life. From queuing to Zoom to mask etiquette, we were faced with an unsettling societal learning curve.<br />Just as noteworthy is how many people, in the face of such disruption, decided that they wanted to learn new things. Online learning sites like Skillshare, Duolingo and Coursera saw extraordinary growth. Enrollments in online art and music classes spiked, while novice bakers flooded the help lines of the Vermont-based flour company King Arthur Baking. Even before “The Queen’s Gambit,” online chess lessons were flourishing. From gardening to camping to bicycling to sewing, people have been taking up new pursuits with abandon.<br />But cultivating new skills and habits is a challenge. Even as we commit to new activities, we struggle to shake off the stasis of familiar routines, especially if we are older. I had this feeling a few years ago when I suddenly realized, shepherding my young daughter to any number of classes and lessons, from swimming to piano, that I couldn’t remember the last new skill I had learned.

North Korea has rebuffed overtures from the U.S. and South Korea to rekindle peace talks.<br />But in the days before the November U.S. elections, North Korea reached out to a European Parliament committee, tasked with handling Korean Peninsula ties, for an online meeting, the people said. The head of the European Parliament delegation, Lukas Mandl, agreed to an informal videoconference conversation with North Korea’s Berlin ambassador.<br />The early December exchange had been suggested by the North’s officials from its Berlin embassy, which after Britain’s planned exit from the European Union in January, has replaced London as the Kim regime’s de facto hub for regional affairs.<br />In the roughly one-hour meeting, the North Korean ambassador repeated a goal of forging a strong relationship with the U.S., so long as Washington’s hostile policy to the Kim regime is dropped, the people said. The stance was received positively, one of the people said, as it didn’t represent a darkening in Pyongyang’s position as President-elect Joe Biden takes office.</td>

      <td>New applications for unemployment assistance fell during a holiday week clouded with uncertainty around impending changes to benefit payments.<br />Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits from regular state programs, a proxy for layoffs, declined by 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 in the week ended Dec. 26, the Labor Department said Thursday. That marked a second consecutive decline from the three-month high recorded earlier in December, when virus cases were surging and more jurisdictions were bringing back economic restrictions to control the spread of the coronavirus.<br />Last week’s level remains higher than any recorded before this year, although it is down sharply from a peak of nearly 7 million in late March.<br />Early last week, Congress passed a $900 billion Covid-19 relief bill to, in part, add $300-a-week supplement for those receiving unemployment benefits and extend two pandemic-specific programs used by about 14 million people. But then President Trump said he was displeased with the bill, casting doubt over whether he’d sign it into law. He ultimately did sign the measure on Dec. 27.<br />The higher payments promised in the bill could have motivated some Americans to seek benefits last week, but the lack of clarity about if the bill would become law may have persuaded some would-be applicants to wait. Unemployed workers are not required to file the week they’re laid off and not all applications are approved.</td>

      <td>They’re not young, necessarily. But once you get past the marketing, there are values to be found.</td>
      <td>OH BABY, there sure seem to be some great wine deals around. In the past several months, I’ve been offered highly touted Baby Brunello and Baby Sancerre and even Baby Bâtard-Montrachet in wine merchants’ emails. The word Baby didn’t appear on the labels but was, rather, the way the wines were characterized by the sellers—a shorthand I suspect would actually mystify many customers. In each case, the merchant promised an outstanding value, but beyond that, the exact meaning of “Baby” was unclear.<br />Associative marketing words have been pegged to wines as long as wine merchants have been selling them. For example, Cabernet and Shiraz are routinely called “masculine,” while just about any rosé gets labeled “feminine.” The “Baby” moniker—a fairly recent development in wine-marketing lingo—might be less offensive, but is it truly effective for selling wine?<br />Mystified myself by the term—or its rather imprecise usage—I decided to ask retailers what they mean by it and what kind of success they have had using it. I quizzed other wine professionals and wine-drinking friends as well. Did they like or even understand the word when it is applied to a wine?<br />I contacted Daniel Lipman, director of marketing and ecommerce at Bottle King, a group of 15 New Jersey wine and liquor stores, about an email I received from the company in August. It advertised a Baby Barolo—aka the 2017 Rocca Giovanni Giaculin ($14). Mr. Lipman told me a handful of customers had asked what the word meant. “They thought the wine was young and not ready to drink,” he said.<br />Mr. Lipman did a bit of research and found he’d used the “B” word four times in promotional emails: once for that would-be Barolo, twice for aspiring Brunellos and once for a white wine from the Rhône. To him, attaching “Baby” to a wine means it is not quite as good as the wine it’s compared to, and “chances are you’re getting it at a much cheaper price.” There is no such thing as a $14 Barolo; the real deal can cost many multiples of that number.</td>

The rights of a U.K. citizen to live, work or study in any other EU member state will also fall away, highlighting the extent of the EU’s reach into its citizens’ daily lives. EU citizens will also lose those rights in the U.K.<br />For supporters of Brexit, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, such costs are justified by the benefits and opportunities that exiting the EU will bring. Leaving will allow the U.K. to boost British trade with the rest of the world and set laws to shape its economy and society without interference from Brussels, they say.<br />“Brexit is not an end but a beginning and the responsibility now rests with all of us to make the best use of the powers that we have regained,” Mr. Johnson said Wednesday during a debate on the U.K.-EU free-trade agreement in Parliament.<br />The agreement reached on Christmas Eve between London and Brussels on the terms of their future relationship ran to more than 1,000 pages, covering areas as diverse as fishing rights and cooperation between law-enforcement agencies.</td>

Fox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent  News Corp  share common ownership.<br />The drops can be attributed in large part to the effects of the virus on their businesses. Production shutdowns in the spring and summer left broadcast networks scrambling to fill their schedules with fresh content in the fall, making them less able to capitalize from an increase in overall television viewing from people being stuck at home.</td>

      <td>YOU MIGHT call Rebecca Wilcomb an ingredient whisperer. At Gianna, her restaurant in New Orleans, she’s known for her high standards when it comes to sourcing as well as the way she understands and combines those immaculate ingredients.<br />This delicious sauté, her final Slow Food Fast recipe, begins with a local catch. “I love Gulf shrimp and I love to highlight our seafood,” Ms. Wilcomb said. She matches the shrimp with cauliflower, highlighting the sweetness and subtlety of both. First she roasts the cauliflower in the oven to coax out its natural sugars. Then she sautés the cauliflower and shrimp together, with some chopped almonds for crunch. A compound butter flavored with rosemary, capers, garlic and lemon zest cloaks the other ingredients in a savory, aromatic glaze.<br />That butter freezes nicely, Ms. Wilcomb said, so consider keeping a batch on hand to punch up other seafoods, steak and poultry. Here, it complements without overpowering the shrimp, which is the true star of this recipe. Buy the freshest you can find and avoid overcrowding the pan when cooking it, Ms. Wilcomb warned, as that lowers the temperature and prevents proper searing. Keep an eye on the clock, too. “Overcooking your shrimp is a big no-no,” the chef said. It only takes a few minutes to get the right tender texture. Indeed, the whole dish comes together quickly, as easy and elegant as it is comforting.<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

He was the first defendant accused under the new national security law to be released on bail.<br />On Thursday, the city’s highest court ruled that he would have to return to prison pending a Feb. 1 review of the threshold for granting bail under the new law, which will be conducted by an appeal committee made up of three judges.<br />The case is being closely watched by Beijing. On Saturday, the People’s Daily, a newspaper seen as a mouthpiece for China’s Communist Party, called the decision to grant bail unbelievable, saying in a commentary that the bail conditions were disproportionate to the damage to national security that could be caused by Mr. Lai—who it branded as “notorious and extremely dangerous.”<br />Mr. Lai, who arrived for the hearing Thursday holding a Bible and flanked by reporters, is a prominent Hong Kong entrepreneur who built a successful clothing brand before founding Apple Daily, a newspaper that openly criticizes China’s Communist Party and pro-Beijing figures in Hong Kong. He appeared regularly at pro-democracy protests in the city, at times at the front of processions.</td>

The cold reality is that the market’s rally has occurred in the midst of a catastrophic pandemic that has killed more than a million people, halted business and travel and wreaked havoc on the economy. Although there are plenty of reasons for the market’s comeback, not the least of which is the Federal Reserve’s massive intervention, the staggering rally is still difficult to comprehend for many investors.<br />“The path we took to get here is something we never, ever, ever would have foreseen,” said Ralph Bassett, head of equities for North America at Aberdeen Standard Investments.<br />Here are the lessons investors say they have learned from an unforgettable year.</td>

What comes next hinges on a handful of unpredictable dynamics, ranging from the strength of the global economic recovery to the health of the U.S. dollar.<br />Most-actively traded gold futures for February delivery finished Wednesday’s session at $1,893.40 a troy ounce, putting gold on pace to finish 2020 up more than 24%—its best year since 2010. That also outperforms the S&P 500, which is up about 15% this year. Front-month futures settled Wednesday at $1,891.<br />After soaring earlier in the year, gold prices have retreated from a record of $2,069.50 an ounce reached in August, dragged down by signs of improvement in the global economy. Investors tend to buy the metal when nervous about holding riskier assets such as stocks or corporate bonds.<br />That leaves some investors expecting more moderate gains in 2021 as the economic outlook improves. From Nov. 6 to Dec. 18, investors pulled more than $10 billion from gold-backed exchange-traded funds, according to data from the World Gold Council, a notable reversal from the record inflows earlier in the year.<br />Much will depend on the strength of the U.S. recovery. A resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic and a runoff election in Georgia next month to determine control of the Senate could prompt market volatility in early 2021, traders say, providing support for gold prices.</td>

      <td>Charles Li’s successor will inherit one of the world’s largest stock exchanges. But Beijing’s tightening control poses new challenges.</td>
      <td>In an uncanny metaphor for Hong Kong’s uncertain future, the city’s bourse has yet to find a new boss after longtime Chief Executive Charles Li retired Thursday. His successor will inherit one of the world’s largest stock exchanges. But Beijing’s tightening control on the financial hub will add new challenges.<br />By most measures, Mr. Li has done a good job as the chief executive of  HKEX ,  the operator of Hong Kong’s only stock exchange, for more than a decade. HKEX’s share price has almost tripled during his stint. The number of listed companies in Hong Kong has almost doubled, while their combined market value has grown from $2.3 trillion to $5.9 trillion.<br />Mr. Li’s background—he was born in Beijing and worked for more than a decade at international investment banks including JPMorgan Chase—epitomized HKEX’s role as the bridge between China and the West.<br />He has further cemented that role thanks to the launch of Stock Connect, a trading link between Hong Kong and the mainland exchanges, in 2014. The trading link has dramatically broadened foreign investors’ access to mainland markets, leading index compilers such as MSCI to include A shares in their indexes. Since its launch, foreign investors have accumulated $184 billion in stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen through Stock Connect, while mainland investors have bought around $222 billion in Hong Kong stocks.<br />But diversification outside China has remained elusive. Mainland Chinese companies make up 80% of Hong Kong’s market capitalization. HKEX’s only overseas acquisition—the $2.2 billion purchase of London Metal Exchange in 2012—hasn’t worked out as expected. Its proposed $37 billion takeover of the  London Stock Exchange  last year was scrapped before it even got off the ground.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—Months after suffering a near-fatal nerve agent attack, Alexei Navalny is now facing new legal problems in Russia that have clouded the future of his opposition movement here and raised the stakes for his plans to return from Germany, where he has been recuperating.<br />Mr. Navalny and his supporters have denied Russian authorities’ accusations this week that the Kremlin’s best-known critic violated probation orders and defrauded supporters of millions of dollars in donations. They say the allegations are meant to deter him from returning to Russia, where he has promised to reinvigorate his network of activists.<br />Mr. Navalny fell unconscious in August aboard a flight to Moscow after meeting with grass-roots supporters in Siberia, and was subsequently evacuated to Berlin, but he has promised to come back and challenge candidates allied with President Vladimir Putin in next year’s parliamentary election, due by September. In recent weeks he has made efforts to publicly identify his attackers.<br />“They are trying to throw me in jail because I didn’t die on that plane and looked for the killers myself,” he said in an Instagram post.<br />The Kremlin has dismissed European authorities’ conclusions that Mr. Navalny was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok and has stood by the diagnosis offered by Russian doctors who initially treated him: that he lost consciousness because of a metabolic imbalance akin to a severe drop in blood sugar.</td>

      <td>BEIJING—China finished 2020 with a 10th consecutive month of expansion in its manufacturing sector, capping a dramatic year that saw the country’s factories incapacitated by the pandemic, only to roar back as a growth engine for China and the world.<br />Beijing’s official gauge of factory activity finished the year at 51.9, in line with expectations and remaining above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, extending a streak that dates back to March. The reading was slightly lower than November’s 52.1 reading.<br />The Chinese economy also showed strength outside its factories. China’s nonmanufacturing PMI, which covers services like retail, aviation and software as well as the real estate and construction sectors, came in at 55.7 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday. Though that reading was down from 56.4 in November, it marked a 10th month of expansion and remains near the highest levels in more than a decade.<br />Taken together, the robust finish to the year is likely to affirm economists’ forecasts for gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter and full year of more than 6% and 2%, respectively. It also suggests a strong start to 2021, with economists both inside and outside the government projecting economic growth of 8% or more in the coming year.<br />Earlier this month,  Goldman Sachs  economists raised their GDP growth forecast for the fourth quarter to 6.8% from a previous estimate of 5.2%, citing expectations for “stronger momentum heading into the new year.” For the full year, Goldman raised its GDP estimate to 2.4% for 2020 from 2.0% previously, and to 8.0% for 2021, up from an earlier forecast of 7.5%.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The prospect of the Senate quickly approving $2,000 stimulus checks dimmed further, with the chamber focused on overriding President Trump’s veto of the annual defense-policy bill before the end of the session and Republican leaders brushing aside Democratic demands for a stand-alone vote on the larger payments.<br />Mr. Trump’s late push to increase the size of direct payments in the recent $900 billion coronavirus-relief legislation to $2,000 from $600 has scrambled the final days of the 116th Congress. Democrats took up Mr. Trump’s push for larger checks, rapidly passing a bill through the House with some Republican support and attempting to approve it in the GOP-led Senate.<br />On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) blocked a vote on the checks, the second time he has objected to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D., N.Y.) requests to vote on the House bill. Instead, he introduced legislation that joins the increased checks with other demands from Mr. Trump that lack bipartisan backing: eliminating Section 230 liability protections for social-media companies and reviewing purported voter fraud in the 2020 election. Mr. McConnell hasn’t announced a plan to take up that legislation.<br />Democrats have decried grouping the three provisions together, saying Mr. McConnell is using the contentious measures to cut off Democratic support for the bill and avoid holding a vote directly on the larger checks.<br />Mr. McConnell said Wednesday the three measures would move together to address Mr. Trump’s requests, and he criticized the House bill to increase the size of the checks, saying it had “no realistic path to quickly pass the Senate.” He said the $2,000 checks were an inefficient way to provide aid, as some of the money would go to people who haven’t suffered financial hardships.</td>

      <td>It is doomed to fail but would still set a destructive precedent.</td>
      <td>President Trump’s last and worst shot at overturning the 2020 election will come on Jan. 6, as the new Congress meets in joint session to tally the votes from the Electoral College. Mr. Trump wants Republican lawmakers to lodge formal objections to Joe Biden’s electors, and this kamikaze mission already has a few volunteers.<br />Here’s what would happen next, at least according to the Electoral Count Act: If a state’s electors are challenged by both a Senator and a Representative, then each chamber is supposed to retire to consider it. If they rejected the electors of enough states to deny Mr. Biden 270 electoral votes, then the House would choose the President.<br />But how could lawmakers justify throwing out electors for Mr. Biden? Although Mr. Trump keeps tweeting claims of massive vote fraud, his lawsuits have been rejected in court, sometimes by his own conservative appointees.<br />Any challenge to Mr. Biden’s electors appears doomed, since upholding the objection takes a majority in both chambers. The Democratic House would use the opportunity to excoriate Mr. Trump a final time on his way out the door, and grown-ups in the Republican Senate are unlikely to play along. Hence the Trump crowd’s latest argument: that the power to invalidate electors rests with the joint session’s presiding officer—Vice President Mike Pence.<br />A nub of truth here is that the Electoral Count Act might be unconstitutional. Originally passed after the contested-election mess of 1876, it purports to let a simple majority of Congress decide which presidential electors are valid, a power that’s hard to justify under the Constitution or separation-of-power principles.</td>

All the more credit to President Trump for opening the door for at least some school-choice relief.<br />The Covid-19 relief bill sets aside $2.75 billion for private K-12 schools on top of some $54.3 billion for public schools. The catch is that none of the private-school funds can be used for vouchers that go directly to families. States can use the funds to support prep schools attended by the children of Members of Congress, but not to help low-income kids attend those schools.<br />Democrats, er, unions, were angry after several Republican governors used their small pot of discretionary education money from the Cares Act to help low- and middle-income families struggling to afford private-school tuition. So they fought to stop governors from doing so again. Republicans surrendered because they didn’t want to hold up the bill.<br />On Monday Mr. Trump signed an executive order that helps remedy the injustice by allowing states and local agencies to draw from $1.7 billion in federal funds from the separate Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program to “provide emergency learning scholarships to disadvantaged families for use by any child without access to in-person learning.”<br />States are supposed to allocate the grant money to groups that help low-income folks with employment, education and housing, among other things. Mr. Trump’s order says recipients can also use the grant funds for scholarships to assist families with private-school tuition and other education costs.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump and Chuck Schumer keep demanding another $2,000 in relief checks for their own political reasons, but it looks like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may hold them off with some crafty political maneuvering. He’s also right on the policy merits.<br />Mr. McConnell has linked the $2,000 checks to Mr. Trump’s other demands to repeal a liability shield for big tech firms and establish a commission to investigate voter fraud. Democrats don’t like the latter two provisions, so a bill with all three isn’t likely to pass the Senate. This betrays that Democrats are merely using the $2,000 checks to help the Democratic candidates in the Georgia Senate runoffs next week.<br />Mr. Schumer wants the Senate to pass the bill the House passed earlier this week with the $2,000 checks. The Senate Finance Committee staff has examined the details of both the House bill and Mr. Trump’s proposal, and it turns out they’re even worse than we thought in flowing to affluent Americans.<br />The House bill would increase the $600 checks to $2,000 ($4,000 for joint tax filers) with another $2,000 for each dependent regardless of age. All told the House bill would provide benefits to a family of five making up to $350,000 a year. The cost would add $463.8 billion to the national debt in addition to the $165.7 billion in checks that passed Congress this month. In other words, Democrats want to burden future taxpayers to write even bigger checks to affluent families today.<br />Mr. Trump’s proposal is somewhat less spendthrift in leaving payments to children age 18 or younger at $600. But he would still provide benefits to a family of five earning up to $266,000 a year and add $315.5 billion to the debt.</td>

      <td>Insurers and providers duke it out, and politicians take credit.</td>
      <td>It will take months to digest everything in the Covid relief bill rammed through Congress and signed by President Trump over the weekend. Both parties are hailing an end to “surprise” medical billing, though a word about this cage match between doctors and insurers.<br />Here’s what we mean by surprise billing: Say you have surgery at a hospital that participates in your insurance network. Unknown to you, the anesthesiologist who puts you under isn’t part of the network. Later this provider bills your insurer for her services, at high prices without a negotiated plan discount. Then the provider sticks you with whatever the insurer refuses to pay. Surprise!<br />Awful stories abound: a family billed $50,000 for a neonatal intensive care unit stay at a hospital in their insurance network. A 2019 analysis in JAMA Internal Medicine found that 39% of more than 13 million visits to an in-network emergency room between 2010 and 2016 ended in an out-of-network bill, frequently for services like radiology.<br />Other evidence suggests the practice is concentrated among a small number of hospitals. A subset of physician staffing agencies seems to have figured out it can be lucrative to leave networks and bill patients directly—a nice little arbitrage game on an opaque, third-party payment system. No one with chest pains looks up his doctor network before dialing 911.<br />Congress has debated intervention that would shield consumers from the damage by limiting them to paying their typical network cost-sharing. As for the rest of the charges, insurers favored a “benchmark” that would reimburse providers at the median rate of in-network services. This is government dictation of what providers can charge. Hospitals and doctors preferred arbitration that would allow a supposedly neutral party to divine the proper price of the service. In other words, both want to club the other with price controls. It’s a pity they couldn’t both lose.</td>

Under the agreement, Ticketmaster—a subsidiary of concert giant  Live Nation Entertainment Inc. —must report to the Brooklyn U.S. attorney’s office on new compliance measures for the next three years. If the agreement is breached, the company could be prosecuted.<br />In a statement, Ticketmaster said two employees responsible for the breach were fired in 2017. “We are pleased that this matter is now resolved,” it said.<br />Federal prosecutors said Ticketmaster executives and employees used login credentials for another company—identified as a U.K.-based online-ticketing platform that allowed artists to sell tickets before general sales—in a coordinated effort to “choke off” the company’s business.<br />The U.K.-based company wasn’t named in court filings, but is identifiable as Crowdsurge, a company that merged with Songkick in 2015. In 2018, Live Nation reached a $110 million settlement with Songkick’s parent company and agreed to acquire it to resolve a lawsuit alleging that Ticketmaster had used illegally obtained information to compete with Songkick.</td>

That would be so much better for my career than where I am now: a comedian approaching 39, who finds his work labeled “far-right” in an academic paper titled “Evaluating the scale, growth, and origins of right-wing echo chambers on YouTube.”<br />Although I’m not mentioned by name, if you turn to the last page of the preprint paper—which has yet to be peer-reviewed or submitted to a journal—you’ll see the words “We the Internet TV” huddled among other supposedly far-right YouTube channels. I was head writer and producer of We the Internet TV before my position was eliminated in October. For five years I was responsible for making hundreds of videos about current events, politics and culture. I was an equal-opportunity offender. Our comedy channel made fun of everybody—left, right, center.<br />I remember the good old days of cancel culture, when if you landed a gig on “Saturday Night Live,” someone would have to put in some work to get you canceled. Before online mobs could be whipped up in seconds, an angry detractor would have to roll up his sleeves, comb through your tweets, listen to hours of your podcast, or track down a recording of you bombing at an open mic to find the material to take you down.<br />Don’t get me wrong: My “problematic” material is out there. But this study eliminates the need for a critic of mine to go put in the legwork of a keyword search. Researchers from prestigious institutions including the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard already went to the trouble of demonstrating that I am somehow responsible for “the phenomenon of right-wing radicalization on YouTube.” It’ll be easy to cancel any success I find in mainstream media.<br />Which videos did it? I wonder. Was it “Burglars for Gun Control” or “Your Gun Makes You Look Like a D—”? The videos lambasting the alt-right or the anti-antifa one? The sketches critical of President Obama’s drone strikes or the one mocking YouTube commenters leaving racist insults about the 44th president?</td>

      <td>The Chiefs win again, and at least two Biden cabinet nominees don’t get confirmed.</td>
      <td>Let’s bid farewell to a horrible year by reviewing my 2020 predictions and offering prophecies for the coming year.<br />Overall, I made 20 correct forecasts—nine incorrect and three are up in the air.<br />What I got right: Mayor Pete Buttigieg won the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden secured the Democratic nomination, President Trump trailed in the popular vote and carried Florida and Ohio while attracting more African-American and Hispanic voters than in 2016. The presidential election came down to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, settled by a wider margin than Mr. Trump’s combined 77,736-vote edge in 2016. Mr. Biden took them by 257,025 votes and won the election. As forecast, Democrats kept the House but with a reduced margin.<br />There was a second U.S.-China trade deal—and it wasn’t comprehensive. Nor did China buy the $141.7 billion in American goods it promised; by November, Beijing had bought only $82 billion.<br />Middle East refugee flows increased but were mostly contained within the region. Libya became more chaotic, and the Islamist threat in the sub-Sahara grew. Iran continued disrupting Iraq, but Iraq’s government appears more stable.</td>

      <td>Driving on the left had the mark of British imperialism—and it was bad for Detroit.</td>
      <td>Of my many international students at Cornell, those from China are among the most eager to take up driving in America. Partly this is due to the popularity of cars in China, the most rapidly motorizing nation on earth. But it’s also because traffic in China and the U.S. follows the same rule of the road. Vehicles in both countries drive on the right. Learn to drive here and you can drive there.<br />China didn’t always drive right; before World War II its traffic ran on the left. That changed at midnight on Dec. 31, 1945. As the new year dawned, traffic throughout the land shifted from one side to the other. It was the work of Gen. Albert Wedemeyer of the U.S. Army, whom President Franklin D. Roosevelt had tapped to replace Joseph Stilwell as commander of American forces in China. Wedemeyer’s move was intended, at least ostensibly, to reduce accidents on China’s roads, which were clogged by American jeeps and trucks. But he likely had an ulterior motive.<br />The Japanese occupation of China prompted Wedemeyer’s decision. By early 1945, imperial troops had been forced out of Burma and the Pacific islands. But two million remained in mainland Asia, mostly in southern China. To drive the Japanese out, Wedemeyer launched Operation Carbonado. It required the marshaling of two divisions of Chinese troops by air from Burma, then moving them 700 miles south from Chongqing to the coast in a convoy of American trucks.<br />But because the vehicles were driven on the “wrong” side of the road, traffic accidents ensued. After driver education campaigns failed, Wedemeyer proposed to Chiang Kai-shek that China’s rule of the road be inverted. The generalissimo agreed. So did most Chinese; the move-left tradition had the mark of British imperialism.<br />Wedemeyer ordered a publicity campaign in preparation. “Posters were placed on telephone poles and shop windows,” he recalled in his memoir, “showing diagrammatically how traffic would move.”</td>

      <td>We have seasons when the leaves fall from us, revealing our bare bones. There is grace in letting go, and in giving ourselves time to repair.</td>
      <td>There will be times, in all our lives, when we find ourselves unraveled, upended, unable. We find no rest. We are not as successful, as on top of things, asloved, as we pretended to be. We have been found out, unmasked. At such times we may prefer to see ourselves as blameless victims rather than the perpetrators of our own pain—the shame will lessen if the cause is external and fixable, rather than self-created.<br />In “Wintering: The Power of Rest and Retreat in Difficult Times,” Katherine May shows us another way to handle our personal winters. “We have seasons when we flourish,” she writes, “and seasons when the leaves fall from us, revealing our bare bones.” In this honest and deeply sympathetic meditation on her own fall through a gap in the “mesh of the everyday world,” Ms. May, a British novelist and essayist, proves that there is grace in letting go, stepping back and giving yourself time to repair in the dark.<br />Her memoir begins at the end of summer, a week before her 40th birthday. Her husband falls dangerously ill and, when he recovers, she is spent. She has found herself in the grips of depression before, but this time she has a young son to care for, and a job that she can’t keep up with. She is riddled with anxiety and paranoia—and very hard on herself, even criticizing her own dreams: “What a silly little human I am, to dream such obvious things.” And yet, as a veteran at wintering, she knows that she can survive. And she is generous enough to share her strategies for how to find respite in the dark and endure until a new spring arrives.<br />She is drawn to the North, to the “peaks and troughs of its seasons,” and travels to Iceland and Norway in search of cold comforts. She tries (and fails) to re-create the Finnish sauna experience in a British sports center. In mid-December, her search for a way toward the light brings her to the annual Santa Lucia concert at the Swedish Church in London, a rather stilted expat affair, which offers a little solace and just enough light to see by.<br />The origins of this Swedish winter ritual are fractured and layered. The modern version involves a candle-lit procession, headed by a girl—Santa Lucia—wearing a crown of candles, and her singing attendants dressed up as a variety of creatures, including virgins in white nighties, gingerbread figures, magi carrying stars on sticks, and gray gnomes. This year, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the celebration was canceled across Sweden for the first time in living memory. No bright candles and nighties, no harmony-singing, just the cold December dark. In Sweden’s old agricultural calendar, Dec. 13 marked the longest night, when supernatural forces were at play, animals spoke with human voices and the boundaries between the worlds disappeared. This fallow, liminal night was followed by a defiant morning of feasting. Later, the vernacular ritual merged with the Feast of St. Lucy and became a festival of light.</td>

Under the plan, the Japanese investment firm’s stake in Katerra will grow to give it a majority stake, while other investors will see their stakes severely diluted, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />SoftBank’s new investment will enable Katerra to avoid having to seek bankruptcy protection, according to Katerra’s chief executive, Paal Kibsgaard. The company needed SoftBank’s latest investment “to continue as a going concern,” he said in a notice to shareholders about Wednesday’s meeting.<br />As part of the funding package, SoftBank-backed financial-services firm Greensill Capital agreed to cancel around $435 million in debt owed by Katerra in exchange for a roughly 5% stake in the company, Mr. Kibsgaard said in an interview Wednesday.<br />Founded in 2015, Katerra has been trying to compete with established builders by assembling building parts in factories and offering services such as plumbing and architecture under one roof.</td>

      <td>Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has soured on the idea of closing schools in response to Covid-19, amid overwhelming evidence of student harm and  a lack of evidence of public benefit. But the destructive policy seems to have a new lease on life in politics. In a dreary Tuesday speech in Wilmington, Del., President-elect Joe Biden suggested that some schools should remain closed through April--and even longer if there is not another huge round of federal spending on education.<br />Mr. Biden, discussing the period following his Jan. 20 inauguration, said:<br />Taxpayers may be even more depressed to learn they will now be asked to fund a Biden administration program to persuade people to ignore the message of the Biden presidential campaign. As candidates, Mr. Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, cast doubt on the safety of any vaccines approved by the Trump administration. On Tuesday, after modestly acknowledging “there’s a vaccination hesitancy in many communities,” Mr. Biden promised “a massive public education campaign to increase vaccine acceptance. We’ll do everything we can to show the vaccines are safe and critically important for one’s own health and that of their families and the communities.”<br />He then promised to “ensure vaccinations are free of charge,” perhaps unaware of existing federal policy. Then Mr. Biden’s speech got a little more confusing when he said:<br />Sounds like someone’s bucking for a demotion.</td>

Josh Hawley of Missouri. “I will object on January 6 on their behalf.”<br />President Trump has blamed voter fraud for his defeat in the November election, but no significant evidence emerged that would challenge the result. Recently departed Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department hadn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud that could reverse Mr. Biden’s election victory.<br />The Trump campaign has continued to try to challenge the results in court, and on Tuesday it asked the Supreme Court to overturn Mr. Biden’s victory in Wisconsin.<br />Federal law requires Congress to count and certify the results of each state’s electoral vote in a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, but lawmakers can raise objections. It takes one member of the House and one senator to formally object and force debate and votes in both chambers.</td>

      <td>Theaters have faced a rough year with the coronavirus pandemic, but the financial upsides they offer filmmakers should help secure their future.</td>
      <td><br /><br />Since Netflix released its first film, “Beasts of No Nation,” five years ago, the rise of streaming services has transformed the distribution of feature films to audiences around the globe. In 2020, Covid-19 took a sledgehammer to the theatrical market, and chaos ensued. With Warner Bros. breaking a longstanding precedent, thanks to its recent decision to release its entire 2021 slate simultaneously in movie theaters and on HBO Max, the fate of the theatrical business is under assault. But those who predict the early demise of the theatrical release may be proved wrong.<br />First the good news. During the pandemic, the demand for quality content has remained incredibly high. Disney+ reached 70 million subscribers far more quickly than anticipated as people want to find great entertainment options. With streamers offering low-cost subscriptions, millions of additional people can access world-class content at an affordable price. This has helped revitalize several subgenres that were waning theatrically, among them the romantic comedy (see 2019’s “Always Be My Maybe”) and the live-action family film (such as “The Christmas Chronicles” franchise).<br />It is also hard to imagine certain hits, like “The Queen’s Gambit,” a captivating but niche period drama miniseries about chess, being as successful in a nonstreaming world. In addition, streaming allows audiences to encounter movies that were otherwise largely overlooked in their initial theatrical release. The critically acclaimed “First Cow” had a small footprint at the cinema but has now found a far larger audience thanks to online distribution.</td>

The French buyer might be more preoccupied with how to make the pricey deal pay off.<br />On Wednesday, Tiffany’s shareholders gave their approval for a slight discount to the original merger terms. The jeweler now has a sticker price of $15.8 billion, down from $16.2 billion. It is still a good result for investors who at one stage feared the deal could collapse. They cash out at a 33% premium to the value of the shares before news of talks between the two sides first leaked in October of 2019, even though the pandemic has shrunk the brand’s revenue.<br />After the deal closes in early January, five top executives at Tiffany will receive golden parachutes worth $100 million in total, and LVMH will begin an overhaul.<br />Jewelry has performed better than other luxury products during the pandemic. Global sales will be down 15% in 2020 compared with last year’s levels based on Bain & Company estimates. By comparison, high-end watches and clothing will decline at double that rate.<br />Tiffany might still underperform the global jewelry market, though. The company’s sales were down by one-quarter over the nine months through October. It relies on tourists for a chunk of sales, particularly at its Fifth Avenue flagship in New York, and its engagement-ring business is suffering as couples delay marriage.</td>

Royster’s “In Hoc Anno Domini” ends by appealing to the best parts of human nature: “And so Paul, the apostle of the Son of Man, spoke to his brethren, the Galatians, the words he would have us remember afterward in each of the years of his Lord: Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”</td>

      <td>Alan Ayckbourn takes on the trio of roles in his 1994 work about a musical prodigy who died of an overdose in Stephen Joseph Theatre’s radio-play version.</td>
      <td>Alan Ayckbourn, a great playwright who masquerades as a popular entertainer, remains abundantly active at age 81. Not only does he continue to write—80 plays to date—but he acted in a radio play of his own, “Anno Domino,” that was webcast in May by Scarborough’s Stephen Joseph Theatre, the company Mr. Ayckbourn led from 1972 to 2009. Now he has given us a second radio play, “Haunting Julia,” first staged in 1994 and newly adapted and directed by the author for audio-only performance, in which he plays three parts with seemingly casual virtuosity.<br />“Haunting Julia” is a latter-day ghost story about a Mozart-like musical prodigy who died of an overdose of sleeping pills at the age of 19 and with whose suicide the play’s three characters are still obsessed 12 years later. Joe, her smothering, uncomprehending father, has turned Julia’s home into a music-center-cum-shrine that is the setting of the play. He persists in believing, all evidence to the contrary, that there was something suspicious about the stated cause of her death: “I’ve had policemen and doctors and psychiatrists all trotting out their favorite scenarios or whatever they call them, and they all amount to a load of so much boiled cabbage.”<br />Andy, Julia’s now-married boyfriend, discovered her corpse the day after she killed herself and believes that she was “completely screwed up from the day she was born by a father who never let her alone for a second….Her only refuge was her music.” Ken, the third character, is a mousy mortuary attendant who claims to have psychic powers and offers his services to the skeptical Joe. “There are things that you catch a sense of—that you know are happening…have happened…are even about to happen…and there’s nothing you can do about it,” he explains. “Not a thing.”<br />“Haunting Julia” is a ghost story in the sense that inexplicable things take place in it (none of which I will describe here). But it is, I think, better understood as a psychological drama about the devastating emotional damage wrought upon people who find it impossible to come to terms with the untimely death of a loved one. Seen from that point of view, it is singularly well suited to the moment, a tale of grief for the age of Covid-19, though there is much more to the play than that. Among other things, Mr. Ayckbourn is also inviting us to speculate on the nature of artistic talent and the way that it can distort the personalities of those who are blessed—or cursed—with it. In Julia’s words, as reported by Ken: “It’s the music….It’s—like a great cloud in front of the sun…It’s blotting out [my] life.”<br />In addition, he rings fresh changes on the underlying theme of his oeuvre, the near-insurmountable difficulty that men and women have in communicating with one another, usually because, as Ken hints, the men aren’t trying hard enough: “We’re like radio sets. But mostly we’re all switched on to transmit, you see. Even when we think we’re listening to each other, we’re not really. We’re actually busy thinking up what we’re going to say, even before the other person’s finished saying what they’re saying.” Scary things happen in “Haunting Julia,” at some of which you will likely jump in your seat, but the play’s deeper emotional resonance comes from its exploration of the male-female divide.</td>

      <td>A desperate mother of two mixes pragmatism with optimism in Phyllida Lloyd’s stirring feature.</td>
      <td>A small Irish film called “Herself,” directed by Phyllida Lloyd, has arrived just in time to take its rightful place as one of 2020’s special pleasures. (It’s playing in select theaters before going to Amazon Prime Video on Jan. 8, 2021.) But small compared to what? If measured by likely budgets, a couple of hundred films on the scale of this one could have been made for the cost of, say, “Wonder Woman 1984.” But “Herself” bulks far larger than any would-be blockbuster with a shriveled spirit if measured by depth of feeling, sheer delight and genuine surprise, even shock. And there’s a startlingly fine performance in the title role by Clare Dunne, who, with Malcolm Campbell, wrote the screenplay.<br />Ms. Dunne is Sandra, the mother of two endearing little girls and the partner of a carpenter, Gary (Ian Lloyd Anderson). His gifts for self-scrutiny and self-control are roughly equal: that is to say, this infantile brute will almost surely kill Sandra if she stays with him any longer. Domestic abuse is the trigger for what follows, but the film is too concerned with the complexities and contradictions of life to be about only one thing. Its next concern is housing—and that’s not the last one either.<br />A waitress at a pub, Sandra also finds time to clean and care for a physician, Peggy O’Toole (Harriet Walter, from “Killing Eve”), who’s back home in Dublin recovering from having broken her hip in a field hospital in Africa. But Sandra doesn’t have the money to rent or buy a safe haven for herself and her children. All three of them are stuck in a public-housing hotel room until she comes upon a promising notion in the form of a tiny house—specs and plans available for free on the internet—that can be built for £35,000, or around $47,000.<br />It’s easy to imagine the feel-good appeal of such a construction project selling an outline, treatment or elevator pitch that leads to a script being written and a film being made in which the mom manages to get the money and build the house. That corresponds roughly to what happens here, but very roughly, since, as I said, home building is only part of an uncommonly rich fabric that constitutes the film as a whole. Another way of putting it is that “Herself” has a largeness of spirit that finds room for its passionate, funny and fiercely desperate heroine and everyone who rallies around her. A couple of scenes threaten to cross the line between joy and sentimentality. For the most part, though, the film makes goodwill plausible by making evil equally so.<br />Sandra, as written and played by Ms. Dunne, is driven by terror and sustained by love for her daughters, Emma (Ruby Rose O’Hara) and Molly (Molly McCann). Depending on the moment, her thought processes are brilliantly clear or touchingly wishful. Both modes collide when she makes an earnest appeal at a welfare office. Given her dim prospects for breaking out of the poverty cycle, and the cost of the welfare hotel, the government would save huge sums, she explains, by lending her the money for the house. Her logic is impeccable and her proposal is, of course, doomed.</td>

      <td>A ‘Masterpiece’ mystery stars Glenda Jackson as an elderly woman with dementia who struggles to convince those around her about the seriousness of a friend’s disappearance.</td>
      <td>Glenda Jackson, two-time Oscar winner and former member of the British Parliament, returns to the small screen for the first time in nearly three decades in “Elizabeth Is Missing,” a mystery that puts a few poignant spins on some conventions of the genre. Has a crime actually happened? Why will no one listen? And how unreliable is our unreliable witness?<br />Having made a triumphant re-emergence on the London stage in 2016 as King Lear, Ms. Jackson brings a kindred squall of wintry ferocity to Maud Horsham, a woman with dementia who insists, to deaf ears all around, that her friend Elizabeth has disappeared. In her 80s, Maud lives alone—under the close supervision of her long-suffering daughter, Helen (Helen Behan)—and gets through her day on sticky notes: “Don’t forget to lock up”; “Coffee helps memory”; and “Today Elizabeth’s house gardening.” While digging about with Elizabeth (Maggie Steed), Maud finds half of an old, lacquered compact, of the type women would have carried in the late 1940s—precisely when Maud’s sister, Sukey (Sophie Rundle), disappeared without a trace. When Elizabeth fails to show up the next day at the “Sally Army” (the local Salvation Army thrift store), Maud immediately assumes the worst—she has a sticky note, after all, confirming that Elizabeth was supposed to arrive. We viewers, however, aren’t quite sure whether Maud, in her mental wanderings, isn’t conflating Elizabeth’s no-show with the truly traumatic mystery of her sister’s disappearance 70 years past.<br />This 90-minute “Masterpiece” presentation of “Elizabeth Is Missing,” for which Ms. Jackson won a BAFTA after it aired in the U.K. last year, keeps one guessing throughout, although the experience is very much about the lead performance; it comes very close to too close for comfort for anyone who’s dealt with a person with Alzheimer’s. The frustrations of Maud—and her family, of course—are expressed with a sympathetic eloquence by Ms. Jackson and her co-stars, notably Ms. Behan and Nell Williams as Katy, Maud’s plucky, punky granddaughter. But Ms. Jackson, who is in her 80s herself, also makes Maud’s physical fragility an element of the suspense—she seems to be falling forward wherever she goes, and you’re never sure she’s going to reach a destination. Maud’s mental state is something else: Her own failing memory infuriates her, but so does the dismissive attitude she gets from those around her, including a policeman who assures her with a chuckle that all available units on land and in the air are looking for Elizabeth. For all the villainy in “Elizabeth Is Missing,” his is perhaps the most repellent. But no one takes Maud seriously—just as no one believed the local madwoman (Cara Kelly) who haunted their village back in 1949, and who seemed to know how and why—and with whom—Sukey had vanished.<br />“Elizabeth Is Missing” was adapted by Andrea Gibb from the 2014 novel by Emma Healey, who based her book on her grandparents and not only understood how dementia appears to the outside world but the conflict it generates in the hearts of those who live with it—not just those afflicted themselves, but those who are entrusted with their care and who eventually become strangers in their eyes. Ms. Jackson has always shown herself to be an exacting and gifted artist, but Maud Horsham is the kind of role that requires much more out of a performer than just actorly craft. And that, happily, is what we get.</td>

No matter which camp you’re in, there are plenty of streaming options. Here, we have TV specials celebrating the end of the year, recommendations that can take you far away and, of course, a few ways to watch the ball drop.<br />There’s no shortage of stars lining up to bid farewell (or worse) to 2020. In Facebook Watch’s “Peace Out 2020” special, an array of boldfaced names—Arnold Schwarzenegger, Anne Hathaway and more—turn out for a send-off.<br />Netflix’s “Death to 2020” is a mockumentary-style look back at the year that—you may be surprised to remember—goes back all the way to a presidential impeachment trial, “Parasite” winning the best-picture Oscar, and Joe Biden’s battle with Bernie Sanders.<br />On Amazon Prime Video, actors and comedians show up for a comedy special “Yearly Departed’’ to chat about all that was lost (for better and worse) in 2020. Tiffany Haddish mourns the loss of casual sex, Natasha Rothwell sends up TV cops, Rachel Brosnahan bids farewell to pants, and Patti Harrison says a few words about the downfall of “rich girl Instagram influencers.”<br />“This is a shocking loss,” she says, “for their family, fans, followers and their branded partnerships with Smartwater.”</td>

      <td>We asked 200 design pros which trends feel fresh vs. finished. They forecast a hunger for hushed, murky rooms and hardware-less cupboards—and a quick fade for farmhouse white and open kitchen shelving.</td>
      <td>DESIGNERS LIKE Lance Thomas see the serendipitous upside of 2020’s quarantine. “It has forced homeowners to evaluate how they live in their homes, how it makes them feel,” said the principal and co-owner of Thomas Guy Interiors in Lake Charles, La. And judging from some of the incoming trends our panel of design pros identified, the feeling most people seek is cushy, coddling comfort. Rich, deep colors replace the chilly white of Modern Farmhouse décor. Earthy, touchable materials push aside the glitz of lacquered finishes and shiny fabrics. When Andrew Kline, design director at New York’s Workshop/APD, called out nubby bouclé fabric and warm woods such as walnut, he commented, “I think this speaks to that need to create a cocoon at home, so that when you shut down your laptop and dim the lights, you’re no longer in your ‘office.’” Here, the decorating styles our experts consider past their “best before” date and the trends that will replace them in 2021.<br />While we still need me-time in the bath to maintain our sanity, the white-on-white loo has lost its allure. “Bathrooms have become less austere, less like operating theaters,” said Boston designer Mally Skok. Once-popular materials are faltering. “Bookmatched marble is so beautiful, but it’s almost echo-y white. It feels cold,” said Ms. Skok. And Sara Hillery, a designer in Richmond, Va., finds fabricated quartz looks too manufactured: “Design trends are headed toward a softer, more natural look, and these man-made options fall short.”<br />Meanwhile, the al fresco shower has acquired powerful appeal, part of the continuing push to “make the outdoor as well-designed and comfortable as the indoor,” as New York architect West Chin put it. San Francisco designer Jay Jeffers, who often installs showers like the one at right on clients’ properties in Napa Valley, points to the dreamy sense of escape they conjure. “You’re almost in a different world—Mexico or the Cayman Islands or Anguilla—somewhere else that’s not your home.”<br />Miami designer Allen Saunders, among others, foresees a rejection of slick surfaces in general. Mr. Jeffers zeroed in on shiny fabrics, a played-out way to bestow a design scheme with glossy glamour. “They give this connotation of a dressier room, which people are just not as excited about these days,” he said. As pillows or upholstery, these light-catching lamés and shimmery satins not only look chilly, they skimp on tactile comfort. “They’re a little harder in terms of their touch and hand,” he said.<br />We’re gravitating to touchable textiles like velvet, mohair and soft bouclé, said Robbie McMillan, co-owner and lead designer of AubreyMaxwell in San Francisco. “Bouclé is everywhere,” concurred Mr. Kline. “We have nowhere to go in our Chanel blazers, so we’re translating the look to sofas,” he said. Elizabeth Cooper, another Bay Area designer, highlighted furry alternatives such as alpaca (see the Arhaus pillow at right), while Bethesda, Md., designer Marika Meyer likes the tactility of crewel embroidery.</td>

      <td>Discovery of new variant coincided with a surge in South African Covid-19 cases past the one million mark</td>
      <td>South African doctors and researchers battling a second wave of Covid-19 cases are racing to understand what role a new coronavirus variant might play in the new surge of infections.<br />Total confirmed cases of Covid-19 in South Africa passed one million this week. On Wednesday, the country of 60 million recorded 17,710 new infections, higher than any daily case load seen during its first wave of infections, which peaked in July.<br />Doctors say they have to ration oxygen and lack the manpower to do best-practice care, such as turning patients on their bellies. One-third of coronavirus tests are coming back positive, suggesting that the true number of infections is likely much higher.<br />South African researchers in November first discovered the new coronavirus variant—which shows similarities to a variant found in December in the U.K.— and it quickly became dominant in the country’s coronavirus hot spots. The researchers say the South African variant has the same mutation that U.K. scientists say might have made the variant there significantly more contagious than other versions of the virus.<br />South African researchers say they also have found changes in the virus’s structure that, in earlier laboratory tests, led to increased resistance to antibodies from people who recovered from Covid-19.</td>

      <td>Biden’s DHS pick led virus responses and implemented DACA; awarding of green cards to wealthy, politically connected investors will likely draw scrutiny</td>
      <td>If there is something supporters and opponents of Alejandro Mayorkas agree on, it is that President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for Homeland Security secretary would bring a wealth of experience to the job.<br />As the department’s deputy secretary during the Obama administration, Mr. Mayorkas led responses to Ebola and the Zika virus, along with strengthening the department’s cybersecurity capabilities—experiences that will be crucial as the country faces a continuing pandemic and a recent high-profile hack of government servers.<br />Having served as the head of the government’s legal-immigration agency before then, he would bring more immigration experience than any previous secretary, an asset in the eyes of the Biden team, who want someone in place to begin quickly unwinding President Trump’s immigration agenda. That combination would also come in handy if, as many analysts predict, one of Mr. Mayorkas’s first crises on the job becomes a surge of migrant children and families arriving at the southern border.<br />That record raises issues for some GOP senators, who point to what they view as serious missteps as reasons he isn’t fit for the job. Mr. Mayorkas, while serving as U.S. attorney in Los Angeles in the late 1990s, advocated for President Bill Clinton to grant clemency for the son of a political ally. At DHS, the department’s inspector general criticized his handling of green cards for wealthy investors connected to prominent Democrats.<br />Republicans boycotted his 2013 hearing to become deputy secretary, and he ultimately won confirmation on a 54-41 party-line vote. Should Republicans retain control of the Senate after the Georgia Senate runoffs in January, those same issues will likely dominate Mr. Mayorkas’s nomination hearing.</td>

      <td>The English Premier League this week rescheduled matches due to coronavirus for the first time since March, turning what was already its most condensed season into a potential logistical nightmare.<br />First came the news that Manchester City had enough players and staff in isolation that it wouldn’t be able to play its match against Everton on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, Fulham requested that its game against Tottenham be rescheduled just hours before it was due to kick off due to “a number of players showing symptoms,” the league said.<br />This comes on top of the league reporting a new high of 18 positive cases from its most recent round of testing and at least one manager, Southampton’s Ralph Hasenhuttl, coaching his team from home this week. The timing of the surge couldn’t be worse: the holiday period is the densest part of the Premier League’s schedule and teams have been visibly exhausted.<br />“Match at 6 p.m…We still don’t know if we play,” Tottenham’s exasperated manager José Mourinho wrote on Instagram before his game was postponed. “Best league in the world.”<br />The entire Fulham squad was due to be retested in the hopes of making its next game against Burnley on Sunday. Manchester City, meanwhile, expected Sunday’s trip to Chelsea to go ahead after a new round of testing returned no further positives, the league said.</td>

The government’s information minister said all the members of the cabinet were safe following the attack. A deputy minister of public works was killed in the attack, officials said.<br />“The cowardly terrorist act that targeted Aden airport is part of the war being waged against the Yemeni state and our great people, and it will only deepen our resolve to fulfill our duties” said Maeen Abdulmalek Saeed, the prime minister in the new government, in a tweet.<br />The Yemeni interior ministry affiliated with the Saudi-backed government said 22 people were killed in the attack and more than 50 wounded.

      <td>Psychologist Susan Pinker explores new discoveries in the science of human nature. Read previous columns here.<br /><br />Last summer my life was upended when I was given an oversize 4-month-old puppy for my birthday. Otis’s arrival created joy and anxiety in equal measure. Already well into the pandemic, my husband and I wondered what effect this shaggy, disoriented creature would have on us. Would he provide comfort? Or would his chewing, nipping, soiling, lunging and barking only multiply our stresses?<br />By April 2020, the adoption rate for dogs in the U.S. had increased by more than 30%, according to Sara Kent, CEO of the nonprofit database Shelter Animals Count. By year’s end, spending on pet care and supplies had reached a record $99 billion. Lots of Americans expect dogs to lift their spirits, it seems.<br />We’re not alone: A new study of the human-dog relationship during the early days of the pandemic, by Liat Morgan and her research team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of British Columbia, found that in Israel, too, dog adoptions ramped up as social and economic restrictions increased. Disasters like earthquakes and floods usually prompt people to give up their pets, but the study found that during the pandemic, far fewer people relinquished their pets to shelters—a trend echoed in the U.S., said Ms. Kent.</td>

      <td>Its monomaniacal pursuit undermines other values—true equality among them.</td>
      <td>President-elect Biden promises “the single most diverse cabinet, based on race, color, based on gender, that has ever existed in the United States of America.” Diversity, and its brother-in-law Inclusivity, is at the center of progressive politics and of woke culture. But what is its true value?<br />Diversity is a serious plank in the platform for equality generally: equality, be it noted, not of opportunity but of result. Diversity—in universities, corporations, government, TV commercials—is in part a deliberate attempt to make amends for past injustices. The intention is to bring minority groups out from their positions of marginality into the center of institutions, politics and culture generally.<br />Universities employ deans and associate provosts whose entire task is to foster diversity. One such person was recently hired “to realize an ideal Northwestern University where community members are challenged to engage differences as strengths in an environment that ensures equality of access, opportunity, participation and representation.” When I spoke to a friend who teaches at Northwestern about what seemed to me the emptiness and unnecessary expense of such a job, he corrected me, at least partly, by pointing out that without such an administrator for diversity the school might be denied federal funds for scientific and other projects.<br />There’s nothing wrong with the idealistic yearning for equality unless it gets in the way of other important goals or goods. The ideal of promised equality under communism, for example, annihilated the ideal of personal liberty. The political philosopher Isaiah Berlin often wrote about the conflict that arises when two good qualities compete. Great goods, Berlin thought, sometimes cannot live together: “We are doomed to choose, and every choice may entail an irreparable loss.” Is diversity, in higher education and in politics, always the right choice?<br />In contemporary higher education, diversity competes with intellectual authority, based on scholarly and scientific accomplishment. These days, diversity is all but victorious and intellectual authority well in retreat. This leaves no one in a position to set or determine educational standards. University presidents, once educational leaders, now focus on fundraising and public relations. The heads of academic departments tend to accept their jobs not out of a desire for intellectual leadership but to reduce their teaching loads. Because of this want of intellectual authority, universities have now been on the slide for many years.</td>

He was 41.<br />Mr. Letlow won a runoff election this month to replace his former boss, Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham, who represents the Fifth Congressional District in the state. It is the state’s largest district and mostly rural, covering the northeastern and central parts of the state.<br />“The family appreciates the numerous prayers and support over the past days but asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time,” said Andrew Bautsch, the Letlow family representative.<br />Mr. Letlow was set to be sworn-in on Jan. 3. Though new to elected office, he wasn’t new to Congress. He served as Mr. Abraham’s chief of staff, interned for former Republican Rep. John Cooksey, and worked for Republican Bobby Jindal when Mr. Jindal was in Congress and later served on his gubernatorial staff, according to the Monroe News Star newspaper.<br />He is survived by his wife and two young children. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said on Twitter he had spoken to Mr. Letlow’s wife, Julia, and offered his condolences. Other Louisiana officials mourned the loss.</td>
