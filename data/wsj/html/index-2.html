      <td>Democrats set to start reconciliation process to allow them to pass legislation without GOP support</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden rallied Senate Democrats to pass a large Covid-19 relief package as party lawmakers pushed forward with a legislative process that would allow them to pass a $1.9 trillion package without Republican votes.<br />During a virtual meeting Tuesday with Senate Democrats, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen joined, Mr. Biden argued that providing too little aid presents a greater risk to the economy than offering too much, according to people familiar with the call. Mr. Biden told Democrats that the U.S. hasn’t provided enough support to the economy during previous recessions.<br />Democrats on Capitol Hill are working on translating Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion plan, which bolsters unemployment aid, provides funds for vaccine distribution, and sends $1,400 checks to many Americans, among other measures, into legislation.<br />“President Biden spoke about the need for the Congress to respond boldly and quickly,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Tuesday after the meeting.<br />Mr. Biden’s meeting with Democrats comes a day after a group of 10 Republicans pitched Mr. Biden on a $618 billion proposal during a White House meeting, calling for the administration to quickly pass a bipartisan package. Mr. Biden, who didn’t take questions during Tuesday’s meeting, told Democrats that he thinks the GOP proposal is too small.</td>

      <td>President Biden’s nominee to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers and cattle ranchers are potential leaders in the new administration’s battle against climate change.<br />Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who led the USDA for eight years during the Obama administration, said Tuesday that government-funded incentives could get farmers and agricultural companies to adopt climate-friendly practices without the need for additional regulation, and could make U.S. food more attractive on export markets.<br />“Farmers are prepared for it and anxious to do it,” Mr. Vilsack said during a virtual confirmation hearing before the Senate agriculture committee. “If it’s voluntary, and incentive based, you will see farmers and ranchers cooperate extensively.”<br />The Senate committee voted Tuesday to advance Mr. Vilsack’s nomination to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. No date has yet been set for that vote, a committee spokeswoman said.<br />Proposals to change agricultural practices are one piece of Mr. Biden’s push to tackle climate change, which was on display in three executive orders issued last week suspending new oil and gas leases on federal land and boosting offshore wind production. Other cabinet nominees have said efforts to address climate change will inform the Biden administration’s infrastructure plans, and how it evaluates risks to the financial system.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Brian D. Sicknick, the Capitol Police officer who died as the result of injuries sustained in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, will lie in honor in the Rotunda of the Capitol beginning Tuesday evening.<br />“May his memory live forever as a model of service to our nation, selflessness in the line of duty, and courage in the face of danger,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on the floor Tuesday.<br />Mr. Sicknick, who was 42 years old when he died in the hospital a day after the riot, becomes only the fifth person to be accorded that tribute reserved for private citizens. Two other Capitol Police officers, Jacob J. Chestnut and John M. Gibson, lay in honor in the Rotunda after they were killed in 1998 by a gunman who had charged past security barriers. Since then, civil-rights pioneer Rosa Parks, in 2005, and the Rev. Billy Graham, in 2018, have been so honored.<br />Many holders of public office, most recently Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, have lain in state in the Capitol building.<br />Capitol Police and other authorities haven’t released information regarding the specific circumstances of Mr. Sicknick’s death, other than to say he died from injuries sustained while trying to protect those trapped in the Capitol on Jan. 6. Prosecutors have said they are examining whether anyone can be charged with murder in connection with his death. While more than a dozen rioters have been charged with assaulting or obstructing law-enforcement officers during the riot, no charges have been brought in connection with Mr. Sicknick. The medical examiner’s office hasn’t yet completed its autopsy report.</td>

The 39-year-old was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president before dropping out of the race and endorsing then-candidate Joe Biden. Since being tapped by President Biden to lead the Transportation Department, Mr. Buttigieg has said he would work to deliver on the administration’s proposal of a $2 trillion campaign aimed at retooling the country’s infrastructure to address the threat of climate change.<br />President Biden’s team had wanted Mr. Mayorkas to be one of a few national security nominees confirmed by inauguration day, Jan. 20, given a continuing domestic extremist threat. But Mr. Mayorkas’s nomination was slowed after several Republican senators including Sens. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) and John Cornyn (R., Texas) objected over immigration policy differences.<br />Mr. Mayorkas faces an array of challenges, from slowing the pandemic to handling cyberattacks against government agencies and a growing domestic terrorism threat, but senators focused on immigration during Mr. Mayorkas’s January confirmation hearing.</td>

      <td>Electronic Arts Inc.  plans to bring back college football videogames after it stopped making them years ago amid a legal battle over the use of student-athletes’ names and images. Yet the return comes with a twist, the company says: the new games, for now, will feature real teams, but not specific players, in a bet that gamers will care more about the name on the front of the jersey than those on the back.<br />EA’s intention to re-enter the college-sports arena comes in the middle of a complex debate involving Congress, state legislatures and the National Collegiate Athletic Association over how and whether to compensate student-athletes.<br />Under a deal announced Tuesday with collegiate-trademark company CLC, EA is gaining exclusive rights to make games that simulate U.S. college football. Game development work is just getting started, the company said, so it could take a few years before any new title comes to market.<br />EA has secured the rights to team logos, uniforms and other college game-day traditions, a company spokesman said. EA, for now, isn’t planning to include player names or likenesses in new games due to uncertainty around rules from the NCAA, the largest nonprofit body supervising U.S. college sports, the spokesman said. The NCAA currently restricts third parties from using those attributes but that could soon change as the organization has committed to rewriting its bylaws amid pressure from high-profile litigation and state legislation.<br />The announcement comes as EA is slated to release its quarterly financial report after markets close today. Analysts expect the company to show strong growth in its business as the pandemic continues to fuel demand for at-home entertainment, after markets close today.</td>

      <td>The deadly nerve agent was developed in the Soviet Union</td>
      <td>Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny was sentenced to serve about 3½ years in prison following his return from Germany where he was transported after a near fatal poisoning attempt last August. Prosecutors had requested that a suspended sentence Mr. Navalny received in 2014 be turned into real prison time, for what authorities said was repeated violations of the terms of his parole, including when he was recuperating in a Berlin hospital. The 3½-year sentence credits the time Mr. Navalny served under house, leaving him to serve 32 months behind bars. European authorities say Novichok, a military-grade chemical nerve agent, was used in the attack against the political activist.<br />It is a deadly nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union and then Russia as a more potent and harder-to-detect alternative to VX and soman. Its existence was first revealed in the early 1990s by a dissident scientist as Moscow prepared to enter the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention to end the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons.<br />Novichok is carried in two parts that are combined to create a viscous liquid just before it is administered—making it difficult to detect. It disrupts the way nerve cells communicate with each other, interfering with muscle control and potentially causing respiratory and cardiac arrest. Once deployed, it remains dangerous in the environment for months, if not longer.<br />They include breathlessness, muscle pain, nausea and vomiting, incontinence and mental confusion.<br />The most effective treatment for Novichok poisoning is atropine, which is derived from the belladonna plant, or deadly nightshade. It isn’t a cure, but if applied quickly it can block the effects of nerve agents. Soldiers likely to be attacked with chemical weapons often carry supplies to inject into their thighs.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—A Russian court sentenced Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to 3½ years in prison, but gave credit for about a year already served, sidelining the country’s most prominent opposition politician and likely fueling a burgeoning protest movement triggered by his detention last month.<br />Mr. Navalny, who was kept in a glass cage throughout the hearing, laughed to himself as the judge read the lengthy verdict. He drew a heart with his finger and looked at his wife, Yulia, as the judge neared the end of the sentencing.<br />During his testimony, the opposition politician blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for a poisoning attack against him last year and called the court proceedings against him an act of cowardice. Striking at the image of Mr. Putin as a master strategist, he said the Kremlin leader never fought his enemies fairly.<br />“[Putin’s] only method is killing people,” Mr. Navalny said. “For as much as he pretends to be a great geopolitician, he’ll go down in history as a poisoner.”<br />Following the verdict, Mr. Navalny’s supporters called for people to take to a central square near the Kremlin, where riot police, with shields and batons, had already assembled. By late evening, police had already detained some protesters there.</td>

      <td>LONDON—Capt. Tom Moore, a British military veteran who shot to fame last year after raising millions of pounds for charity by walking lengths of his garden during lockdown, has died at age 100 after contracting the coronavirus.<br />Capt. Moore’s family said on Twitter that he had been fighting pneumonia and had tested positive for the coronavirus in January. During the last year, the World War II veteran became a mascot for a British nation plagued by Covid-19, raising millions for health workers, recording a No. 1 single, publishing a book and being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his efforts.<br />His arrival on the public stage happened almost by accident. After Britain went into lockdown last spring, he announced a sponsored walk round the garden in his home in Marston Moretaine just north of London. Age 99, he planned to walk a hundred lengths of the garden and raise £1,000—about $1,365—for charities linked to the National Health Service. The quest became an internet sensation. He raised almost £33 million.<br />“For all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment: The sun will shine on you again and the clouds will go away,” said Capt. Moore after completing his walk.<br />Queen Elizabeth II paid tribute to Capt. Moore, “recognising the inspiration he provided for the whole nation and others across the world.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said “in the face of this country’s deepest postwar crisis he united us all, he cheered us all up, and he embodied the triumph of the human spirit.” A Union Jack above Downing Street was flown at half-mast.</td>

      <td>As Western governments faced criticism for their pandemic management last summer, European Union officials began work on a vaccine-procurement plan they hoped would put the continent at the forefront of efforts to banish the coronavirus and reopen economies.<br />Instead of its 27 member states fighting for doses from a few manufacturers, the European Commission, the closest the bloc has to a government, would centralize purchases for some 450 million inhabitants, bringing prices down and ensuring that residents of rich and poor countries alike would get equal access to the best shots available.<br />Half a year later, an acute shortage of doses is keeping the EU’s vaccination effort from taking off, making it likely that only a small portion of the general public will get a shot by the end of summer. The reasons: The EU was late in ordering vaccines compared with the U.S. and the U.K.; it bet on companies that have yet to deliver; and when delays started creeping in, it blamed the manufacturers instead of restarting negotiations.<br />“There are about 10 hard weeks of vaccine deficiency ahead of us,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn told journalists over the weekend. “More [vaccines] could have been ordered, and faster.”<br />Israel has vaccinated 55% of its population, the U.K. 14% and the U.S. 9.4%, against just 2.8% for the EU. At current rates, only two members, Malta and Romania, will have immunized one-third of their population by the end of the year, according to a Jan. 29 report by UBS.</td>

      <td>Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek star as an unlikely duo on a drug-induced quest to prove that their world is a simulation in this sci-fi film written and directed by Mike Cahill.</td>
      <td>Writer-directorMike Cahill’s 2011 “Another Earth” was a tantalizing feature, in large part because its sci-fi elements orbited at an oblique angle: The heart of the story was recklessness, tragedy and a young woman’s need for redemption. Only tangentially did it involve an alternative planet, a parallel reality and a correctable past. It was off-handedly fantastic, thus plausible. It was everything “Bliss” is not.<br />Directed by Mr. Cahill from his own screenplay, the Amazon Original “Bliss” stars Owen Wilson as Greg Wittle, an employee of a company called Technical Difficulties (“We’re sorry you’re having technical difficulties,” hundreds of employees recite into hundreds of phones). This by itself is not a harbinger of good news, nor is it particularly subtle: As becomes clear very quickly, Greg is malfunctioning. His wife has recently kicked him out. His daughter, Emily (Nesta Cooper), is inviting him to her graduation, which he’s reluctant to attend. He’s been feigning various physical injuries, it appears, and has run out of opioid refills (as he’s told by an impatient pharmacist). The boss wants to see him, right away; he crushes a pill into snortable form before answering the summons.<br />We sympathize with his plight, but we also see soon enough why his fellow employees might hate him. Which they quite obviously do.<br />Mr. Cahill gives us Greg on the cusp of a meltdown, with his life collapsing in two directions at once—homeless criminality on the one hand, intoxicated euphoria on the other. Fleeing his office, where things have gone terribly wrong, he visits the corner bar—Plato’s Dive, not insignificantly—where he meets the magically unreal Isabel Clemens (Salma Hayek). A much-tattooed, ornately attired street person—or witch, or prostitute with a drug habit similar to Greg’s—Isabel can control people and things with a wave of her hand, or so it seems. And she informs Greg that while they occupy a “real” reality, most of what they’re seeing isn’t there at all. They need to procure more of the enchanted amber crystals they ingest “in order to exit this stupid simulation.” Much of their time is occupied in doing just that and flitting from skid row to paradise. The viewer, meanwhile, is wondering why he should buy into any of it.<br />Mr. Wilson has always seemed congenitally sardonic and Ms. Hayek, quite game given the material, is a comedian at heart. So neither seems wholly committed to the seriousness of “Bliss”—and if the story isn’t serious, what is it? As it irreparably slips the cumbersome bonds of reality, entering a drug-induced world where dosage determines action and location, it seems to be a parable about addiction, while also suggesting that if one had enough drugs one could permanently exist in a state of bliss. As this cannot happen, Greg’s story is just terribly sad, in a way that all the hallucinations in his head can’t make more palatable for the viewer.</td>

      <td>Barton Swaim’s “Trump and the Failure of the Expert Class” (op-ed, Jan. 23) describes how the “experts” got it wrong in 2016 because they were totally out of touch with the average American and misread the mood of the voter. The flashing light that should have been a signal to the pollsters, consultants and political pundits was the consistent 30%, plus or minus, support for Bernie Sanders and similar support for Donald Trump throughout the Democratic and Republican primaries. The conclusion to be drawn was that approximately 60% of all Americans were fed up with the establishment “business as usual” political system and were looking for drastic change either in the form of a self-avowed socialist or populist. When Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination, it was no surprise that Bernie supporters either stayed home or voted for Donald Trump.<br />Mr. Swaim points out the inability of experts who “acknowledge no error,” leaving little doubt they will continue to misread the mood of the American people. According to a December 2020 Gallup poll, Congress’s approval rating was 15%, indicative of the public’s disdain for how the government is being run. Antifa-encouraged riots, continued strong support for Sen. Sanders and his agenda and the 2020 election results showing President Trump received more votes (including those of African-Americans and Latinos) than any previous Republican should be a wake-up call for the Republican Party. If Republicans want to be relevant in future elections, they should recognize Americans on both sides of the political spectrum are tired of the status quo, which isn’t working for them.<br />Members of the expert class will continue to create their opinions within their own bubble of reinforcing data, leaving a wide-open political landscape for those willing to venture beyond those self-imposed constraints.<br />Ken Dropek<br />Houston</td>

      <td>Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Fossil-Fuel Freeze” (Jan. 23): The federal leasing system has been a mess for a long time. Overproduction and a glut in global oil markets has driven prices down and bankruptcies up since 2015—long before the pandemic. In other words, there is no urgency to lease more federal land for drilling, a course the Trump administration blindly pursued. Most lease sales have one bidder, many none at all. Leases often sell for $2 per acre. Millions of leased acres sit idle and will probably never enter production. In the recent, highly contentious Arctic National Wildlife Refuge lease sale, the biggest bidder was the state of Alaska, and no major oil producers submitted bids at all.<br />Moreover, royalties from mineral development on federal land have been an important revenue stream for western states like New Mexico. Yet the same 12.5% royalty rate has applied since 1920s, while oil-rich states like Texas charge as much as 25% for drilling on state lands.<br />The sky is not falling for the oil and gas industry, and there is neither a shortage of federal oil and gas leases nor a need for expanding production.<br />Autumn Hanna<br />Taxpayers for Common Sense</td>

The company, which has a market value of about $25 billion, has been an active acquirer in recent years as it diversifies. A deal for Planters would be by far its largest to date.<br />Kraft Heinz, the product of a 2015 merger of the two well-known food companies, has been divesting brands after it struggled to keep up with shifting consumer tastes.

They were from a Dec. 8 Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on early treatment of Covid-19. One was a 30-minute summary; the other was the opening statement of critical-care specialist Pierre Kory.<br />Dr. Kory is part of a world-renowned group of physicians who developed a groundbreaking use of corticosteroids to treat hospitalized Covid patients. His testimony at a May Senate hearing helped doctors rethink treatment protocols and saved lives.<br />At the December hearing, he presented evidence regarding the use of ivermectin, a cheap and widely available drug that treats tropical diseases caused by parasites, for prevention and early treatment of Covid-19. He described a just-published study from Argentina in which about 800 health-care workers received ivermectin and 400 didn’t. Not one of the 800 contracted Covid-19; 58% of the 400 did.<br />Dr. Kory asked the National Institutes of Health to review his group’s manuscript outlining dozens of successful trials and to consider updating its Aug. 27 guidance in which it recommended “against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19, except in a clinical trial.” On Dec. 10, Sen. Rand Paul and I sent a letter to the NIH requesting that it review Dr. Kory’s evidence.<br />On Jan. 14, NIH changed its guidance to neutral by acknowledging the successful trials but determined “that currently there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19.” On Jan. 22 I sent an oversight letter asking what actions the NIH had taken to explore the use of repurposed drugs for treating Covid-19.</td>

      <td>The best shot at a bipartisan bill is focusing on relief, not structural change.</td>
      <td>The Covid-19 relief bill is the first test for the Biden administration. It’s no surprise there’s disagreement on how to proceed. One controversy is strategic: How vigorously should the administration pursue bipartisan support for its legislation, and what price should it be willing to pay to achieve it? Some Democrats—myself among them—believe that the president’s calls for unity will be hollow unless he does all he can to reach a bipartisan agreement that satisfies his core objectives. Monday’s meeting with 10 Republican senators to discuss their $618 billion offer was a good first step, and conversations will continue.<br />In the end compromise may be out of reach, and Mr. Biden could be forced to depend on Democratic votes. Then the question will be if the arcane congressional process of “budget reconciliation” is compatible with political reconciliation. The optimists hope that the president can start with one-party government and shift to bipartisanship later; the pessimists fear that early partisanship will poison the well for the next two years. I believe that the preponderance of the evidence supports the pessimists, but Mr. Biden will have to make a tough call.<br />The other controversy is over policy: What does an adequate response to the pandemic require? Nearly everyone agrees that the federal government should do more to help states and localities vaccinate their populations as quickly as possible. Most agree on money for more testing, personal protective equipment, and treatments for those who contract Covid-19. More assistance for small businesses also enjoys broad support, despite doubts from economists that such programs are an effective and efficient use of public resources.<br />But then agreement breaks down. The Senate Republican plan meets the administration’s funding request for vaccinations and other health-related measures, but offers less for extended unemployment payments, aid to schools, and checks to individuals. It doesn’t increase the child tax credit and provides no direct aid to states and localities. But even this may be too much for House Republicans.<br />Step back from the details, and it’s clear the administration proposals serve four distinct policy objectives: relief, stimulus, investment and structural change. The details matter, but measures to mitigate immediate hardship enjoy the broadest support. Measures to promote economic and social change—such as increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour—are the least popular. Proposed investments for the future, such as rebuilding and restocking the National Strategic Stockpile, are also widely supported, in part because of their relatively modest cost.</td>

Tuesday’s announcement marks the largest deal to date in the U.S. online alcohol space, according to the Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America, a trade group representing more than 350 distributors.<br />Delivery has become an unexpected lifeline for Uber as the pandemic has hammered its core ride-hailing business. The company acquired food-delivery rival Postmates Inc. last year in a stock deal valued at $2.65 billion.<br />That combination made its Uber Eats business the second-largest food-delivery company in the U.S. after  DoorDash Inc.  Both companies have shored up their delivery offerings during the health crisis. Uber began delivering groceries in the U.S. and Canada last year, after acquiring Chilean startup Cornershop. DoorDash started delivering cleaning supplies and over-the-counter medicines from 7-Eleven convenience stores,  Walgreens  and CVS, among others.<br />The pandemic turbocharged online sales of alcohol, a category that has long lagged behind other consumer goods products in the U.S. and some other key markets due to strict regulations and entrenched consumer habits. E-commerce made up just 1% of U.S. alcohol sales by retailers in 2019 by volume but is expected to grow to 7% by 2024, says industry tracker IWSR.</td>

      <td>The big challenge for the next boss of  Ferrari  will be managing the racing-car brand’s strategy for cutting tailpipe emissions.<br />The pandemic halted the car manufacturer’s production lines for seven weeks—with a 10% knock-on reduction in sales last year, the company reported Tuesday. Otherwise, Ferrari has cruised through the crisis with few scratches. It projects a rebound in revenue this year to roughly 13% more than its pre-pandemic 2019 total, underpinned by strong orders since last summer. The shares fell 5% in morning trading, perhaps because some investors were hoping for an even stronger outlook from a company that has routinely beat expectations in recent years.<br />Since its 2015 initial public offering, investors have gradually come to treat Ferrari as an exception to the general rule that car makers are capital-intensive, low-margin businesses whose shares are better suited to hedge-fund trades than long-term money. Given its small production volumes and big backlog of orders from ultrarich clients, they see the Italian company as a luxury-goods maker, not a metal basher.<br />But in one respect Ferrari is like other car makers: It needs to reinvent its powertrains. Environmental rules are tightening everywhere, punishing supercars, which produce disproportionate carbon emissions per mile. Consumer attitudes also are greener among younger generations that Ferrari needs to cultivate as future clients.<br />Former Chief Executive Louis Camilleri, who stepped down unexpectedly in December following a bad case of Covid-19, didn’t dodge the problem, investing in hybrid technology and decarbonizing production. The company delivered its first hybrid model, the SF90 Stradale, in the fourth quarter.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Investigators examining the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol have ramped up efforts to identify and charge participants who assaulted or otherwise obstructed law-enforcement officers during the attack, interviews and a review of court filings show.<br />While many of the more than 100 cases filed in the days after the riot were based largely on social-media postings and the testimony of friends and neighbors who reported alleged rioters, FBI agents and other investigators are reviewing hundreds of hours of footage from the body-worn cameras of police officers involved in responding to the riot. They are also relying on evidence returned from the more than 500 grand jury subpoenas and search warrants they have obtained to date.<br />One alleged rioter, Ryan Samsel, was accused in a complaint unsealed Saturday of pushing barricades against a police line, knocking down one officer who hit her head on a flight of stairs behind her and lost consciousness. Another, Zachary Jordan Alam, was accused of pushing his body up against officers guarding the Speaker’s Lobby door as he used his fists, legs and a helmet to break the glass windows in the door of the Speaker’s Lobby during what became a deadly altercation with Capitol Police.<br />In an indictment returned late last week, two alleged New York members of the Proud Boys group face charges of conspiring to obstruct law-enforcement officers by removing the metal barricades Capitol Police officers had erected to control access to the grounds and ripping away an officer’s riot shield that was later used to smash a window of the building.<br />Another alleged rioter, arrested in Nebraska last week, was charged with impeding an officer by allegedly yelling for others to take away his shield.</td>

      <td>Skyworks, Cirrus Logic show benefits and risks of Apple dependency</td>
      <td>Apple Inc.  is definitely having a moment. For the many chip companies who supply the tech giant, the question remains just how long that moment will last.<br />Last week, Apple reported its best quarter in years. It enjoyed strength across its business segments, but the key driver was the iPhone—which still accounts for more than half the company’s total revenue. iPhone revenue jumped 17% year over year to a record $65.6 billion for the December quarter, thanks mainly to the launch of the new iPhone 12 models in the fall. Apple no longer discloses unit sales, but market research firms IDC, Canalys and Counterpoint estimate the company shipped between 82 million and 90 million iPhones during the quarter, which would also break the record 78.3 million units the company reported for the same quarter of 2016.<br />That is great news for the companies who supply key iPhone components. Skyworks, which specializes in radio-frequency chips, last week reported a 69% year-over-year jump in December-quarter revenue to $1.5 billion—42% above Wall Street’s expectations. The stock has climbed 15% since that report.  Cirrus Logic ,  whose chips are used for audio encoding, reported Monday that its December-quarter revenue rose 30% from a year earlier to about $486 million.<br />More are on the way.  Qorvo ,  a Skyworks competitor, is expected to post a 23% increase in revenue for the December quarter on Wednesday, according to consensus analyst forecasts. Also coming Wednesday is December-quarter results from  Qualcomm ,  which recently won back its place in the iPhone’s modem chip socket. Analysts expect Qualcomm to post an 80% year-over-year quarterly rise in chipset revenue, according to FactSet.<br />But dependency on Apple can backfire. Over the long term, suppliers face the risk that Apple could design them out with its own in-house chips. Over the short term, seasonal fluctuations can also hurt. Cirrus projected March-quarter revenue in a range of $280 million to $320 million—the midpoint of which was only in line with Wall Street’s estimates. That would represent 7% growth year over year, a significant slowdown from the previous quarter. The company warned in its letter to shareholders that “our customers can, and frequently do, change individual orders on short notice.” Apple accounted for 84% of Cirrus’ revenue for the past three quarters, according to the company’s quarterly filing Monday. Cirrus shares were down 5% Tuesday morning.</td>

Mr. Sorenson, who remains president, CEO and a board member, will be “directing the company to the extent practical,” Marriott said Tuesday.<br />Stephanie Linnartz, the group president for consumer operations, technology and emerging businesses, will oversee Marriott’s international lodging division, as well as legal, human resources, communications and public affairs, the Bethesda, Md.-based company said. Tony Capuano, the group president for global development, design and operations services, will be in charge of the company’s U.S. and Canada lodging division and finance, it added. Both executives are assuming additional responsibilities on top of their current jobs.<br />“While I have worked throughout my treatment to date and plan to remain as engaged in the business as my health allows, the right thing to do for me, my family and the company is to focus on my health,” Mr. Sorenson said. He said his treatment is being handled at Johns Hopkins.<br />Mr. Sorenson led the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide in September 2016, creating a hotel giant with a presence in 130 countries and territories.

      <td>The former president plans to argue the process is unconstitutional because he is out of office</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Donald Trump and House impeachment managers will give the Senate details of their respective strategies Tuesday ahead of the trial on a charge that the former president incited a riot at the U.S. Capitol, with Mr. Trump’s team planning to argue that the entire exercise is unconstitutional.<br />Mr. Trump had until noon to respond to a summons, while the House Democrats prosecuting the case had until 10 a.m. to submit a trial brief. Under the rough rules sketched out for the trial, the parties are charged with answering two main questions: whether Mr. Trump can be tried in the Senate for acts committed when he was president, and how they respond to the charge of “incitement of insurrection.”<br />Forty-five of the Senate’s 50 Republicans last week sided on a procedural vote with the argument that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional because Mr. Trump is now a private citizen, and Mr. Trump’s legal team plans to emphasize that point. The key premise of Tuesday’s filing will be the argument that convicting Mr. Trump would be unconstitutional, adviser Jason Miller said. The defense team also plans to argue that the impeachment proceedings were conducted inappropriately, pointing to the fact that Democrats introduced no witnesses or evidence and didn’t allow Mr. Trump to have a lawyer present.<br />“He’s basically being impeached based on speeches made by politicians in Congress,” Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, said in an interview. Mr. Giuliani isn’t serving on the former president’s defense team.<br />House Democrats have been busy honing arguments that the trial is constitutional. “The whole argument defies common sense,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the lead impeachment manager, said in an interview last month. “It seems to say that if a president decides to commit the most atrocious act of trying to foment a violent insurrection or stage a coup against the country, but does it in the last couple weeks in office, that president cannot be impeached and tried in the Senate for doing it.”</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—Russia’s homegrown Sputnik V vaccine showed high levels of efficacy and safety in a peer-reviewed study released Tuesday, a potential boost for the Kremlin’s aim to promote the Covid-19 shot abroad and curb the pandemic at home.<br />The findings, from a preliminary analysis of a large-scale clinical trial published in the British medical journal the Lancet, demonstrated that the two-shot vaccine was 91.6% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 and offered complete protection against severe cases. There were no serious side effects, the paper said. The vaccine was also found to be similarly safe and effective in elderly people.<br />The study could be a significant milestone for Moscow in the global vaccination race, potentially offering President Vladimir Putin’s government geopolitical clout in the developing world and the chance to tap into the lucrative global vaccine market. Russia—the world’s fourth worst-hit country with nearly four million cases—has also banked on Sputnik V to avoid new costly lockdowns as authorities plan to vaccinate 60% of the domestic population by the end of the year.<br />The shot, which was approved by Russian authorities in August before undergoing large-scale clinical trials, has stirred questions in light of its fast-tracked development and lack of published trial data. So far, Sputnik V has been administered to more than two million people world-wide, including in Argentina, Serbia and Algeria, according to Russian authorities.<br />Tuesday’s results could help clear doubts surrounding the Russian shot.</td>

      <td>For oil  supermajor BP ,  one big obstacle stands out on the road to a greener future: its almost 20% stake in Russia’s top oil producer.<br />On Tuesday, the British company reported disappointing 2020 results, hit by lower prices, depressed demand and asset write-offs. The shares fell in early trading, having significantly underperformed peers since Chief Executive Bernard Looney announced a new strategy in September. The plan to move away from fossil fuels and into clean energy and convenience retailing has been sufficient to scare off some traditional investors, but not radical enough to attract green-minded ones.<br />The investment in Rosneft is a problem. The Russian state-backed company has a plan to develop the fragile Arctic region with 6,500 wells and 5,500 km of pipelines, as well as airports, ports, towns and highways, all working to produce and distribute 1 million tons of oil a year. The so-called Vostok project is kryptonite for the environmental investors BP is hoping to attract.<br />The company wants to sell $25 billion in assets by 2025 to pay down debt, but not the Rosneft stake. That is despite BP’s lack of control: It has two board seats and some influence, but Moscow is definitely in charge.<br />Mr. Looney said Tuesday that the Rosneft stake fits well with the new strategy. The Russian company’s production costs are about half of BP’s, and it plans to decrease its greenhouse-gas intensity. The stake is a “good financial investment,” he said, having contributed $4 billion in dividends to BP since 2013.</td>

A separate Facebook page for announcements from the military wasn’t banned in 2018 and remains operational.<br />The head of Myanmar’s military, Gen.

That compares with a 3.5% decline for the U.S. economy last year, supported by a strong rebound in the fourth quarter. China’s economy grew by around 2.3% last year.<br />Since the start of the pandemic, European policy makers have sought to balance saving lives and supporting businesses, but have generally pursued more draconian restrictions to stop the virus’s spread than has the U.S. Nonetheless, the death toll in Europe is approaching that of U.S., while its economic performance—already lagging behind the U.S. before the pandemic—has been much worse than other advanced economies.<br />Now, a sluggish rollout of vaccines, the threat of highly contagious new variants of the virus and the possibility of weeks or months of continued restrictions bode ill for the near term and could delay a recovery. EU countries have administered vaccines to less than 3% of their populations compared with 9% in the U.S. and 14% in the U.K., according to OurWorldInData.</td>

That generated 498.2 billion yuan, equivalent to $74.1 billion, in gross merchandise value during those 11 days, excluding unpaid orders, up 26% from the same time frame in 2019, the company said Tuesday.<br />Sales for the fiscal third quarter rose about 37% to 221.08 billion yuan, ahead of the 214.29 billion yuan analysts polled by FactSet had expected.<br />The company’s cloud-computing revenue grew 50% to 16.12 billion yuan, a gain the company attributed to customers in the internet, retail and public sectors. Alibaba said it processed 583,000 orders per second during the 11.11 event.<br />The company’s results come after the suspension of a blockbuster initial public offering of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group Co. in November, a sudden halt to what would have been the world’s largest IPO. The move delivered an extraordinary rebuke to Jack Ma, the billionaire co-founder of both Alibaba and Ant who drew the ire of Chinese regulators when he gave a speech at a financial forum in Shanghai in October. Chinese authorities have launched a probe into Alibaba for alleged anticompetitive behavior on its e-commerce platform.</td>

      <td>Tesla Inc.  is recalling roughly 135,000 Model S luxury sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles over touch-screen failures, one of the electric-car maker’s largest-ever safety actions.<br />The move comes after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requested a recall last month, saying the touch screen in some models can fail when a memory chip runs out of storage capacity, affecting functions such as defrosting, turn-signal functionality and driver assistance. The agency said the problem affected roughly 158,000 vehicles, including Model S sedans built between 2012 and early 2018 and Model X vehicles made from 2016 through early 2018.<br />The reason for the discrepancy between the NHTSA’s figure and the number of vehicles Tesla plans to recall wasn’t immediately clear.<br />Tesla said in a letter to federal regulators made public Tuesday that while it disagreed that the issue constituted a defect in the vehicles, it was going ahead with a recall to conclude the investigation and provide a better experience for customers.<br />“It is economically, if not technologically, infeasible to expect that such components can or should be designed to last the vehicle’s entire useful life,” Tesla said in the letter.</td>

      <td>Demand rises for premium napkins and toilet paper, with more people home during the Covid-19 pandemic</td>
      <td>Wood-pulp prices are soaring thanks to speculators in China, with help from paper takeout containers, a weaker dollar and people using restrooms at home instead of the office.<br />Bleached softwood kraft pulp futures have risen 48% on the Shanghai Futures Exchange since Dec. 1, to about $1,037 a ton. Meanwhile, producers around the world are boosting prices for the wood mash at unusually sharp rates.  Domtar Corp. , based in South Carolina, said it would raise prices this month between $100 and $130 a ton, depending on grade.<br />“Spot prices are really jumping,” said Brian McClay, a pulp-market consultant and a founder of pricing service Trade Tree Online. “I’ve been in the pulp business since 1978 and have been asking friends: No one has seen this before, no one has seen the scale of this.”<br />Prices are hottest for softwood pulp, the type that comes from coniferous trees and is used to make products such as premium toilet tissue, paper towels, junk mail and coffee cups. It is made from sawmill scraps as well as from trees too skinny, knotty or crooked to be cut into lumber.<br />China buys more than one-third of the world’s pulp and churns out paper products and packaging. Shanghai pulp futures, which began trading in 2018, serve as a price guide for an array of varieties and grades, similar to the way that West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude futures are reference points for oil prices.</td>

Russian authorities say Mr. Navalny repeatedly violated the terms of his parole, including when he was recuperating in Germany after he was poisoned.<br />Prosecutors made their request when Mr. Navalny was abroad. The opposition leader says it was meant to deter him from returning to Russia, where he had promised to resume his campaign against President Vladimir Putin.<br />Alexei Navalny is Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, a fierce anticorruption activist who has managed to galvanize Russia’s political opposition by exposing flaws in the more than 20-year rule of Mr. Putin.<br />Mr. Navalny first dove into politics as part of a broader ethnic Russian nationalist movement. But in 2012, he pivoted to become part of a wider coalition of opposition groups that sought to lead protests against Mr. Putin’s decision to return as president after serving for four years as prime minister.<br />Mr. Navalny is a skilled speaker who rouses crowds with ease, but his real weapon is his YouTube channel that gives him a nationwide platform to reach nearly 4 million subscribers and urge them to protest in the streets of Moscow and other big cities.</td>

      <td>India’s aggressive new fiscal plan will be a boon to its post-Covid recovery. But there is still no coherent longer-term plan for lifting the country into the upper-middle-income club.<br />First, the good news. The finance ministry has opted to generously lubricate the stuttering economy, setting a deficit target for the coming financial year significantly higher than expected, at 6.8% of gross domestic product. That means a plan to cut the deficit to 3% of GDP within five years has been effectively abandoned.<br />The expanded deficit isn’t just down to lower tax revenue, but higher spending on infrastructure, health and education. India suffered one of the world’s sharpest downturns during the pandemic, with second-quarter GDP down 23% from a year earlier. For now, the benefits of a supportive fiscal policy far outweigh the drawbacks.<br />What is less promising is what the budget suggests about the government’s overall strategy to lift incomes over the longer term, especially in the context of other recent policy decisions.<br />India now sits conspicuously outside both large Asian trade blocs: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the more recent Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. It is not the obvious choice for any manufacturer looking to expand operations outside of East Asia but within a unified supply chain.</td>

      <td>Northern California space-transportation company Astra Space Inc. intends to be the first maker of small rockets to go public in the U.S., using a blank-check company, or SPAC, in a transaction valuing it at $2.1 billion.<br />One of the few space startups with flight-proven technology, Astra said it is teaming up with billionaire telecommunications investor Craig McCaw to take advantage of the surging popularity of such transactions across an array of evolving high-technology sectors. SPAC stands for special-purpose acquisition company, a vehicle for swiftly taking entities public.<br />Alameda-based Astra, which has about 120 employees, late last year blasted a rocket to the edge of space from a launchpad in Kodiak, Alaska. The booster failed to reach orbit velocity during that demonstration flight in December. Company founder and Chief Executive Chris Kemp, a former high-ranking NASA official, said he expects another test soon, followed by an initial commercial mission as early as summer.<br />In going public, Astra seeks to stand out from a bevy of small-rocket competitors by locking in funding despite fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and an anticipated shakeout of rivals targeting the same market segment.<br />The company says it is able to lift satellites weighing about 100 pounds into low-earth orbit, but gradually hopes to increase that capacity about fivefold. Astra’s move comes amid a boom in the use of relatively compact satellites for internet access, earth imaging, military applications and other purposes.</td>

      <td>LONDON— BP  PLC returned to profit in the fourth quarter but said the pandemic, which battered the oil-and-gas industry in 2020, would continue to challenge its business this year.<br />Covid-19 has sapped demand for oil, hitting prices, and prompted the world’s biggest energy companies to slash spending, cut jobs, write down the value of their assets and—in the case of BP and  Royal Dutch Shell  PLC—lower dividends. The crisis led U.S. oil giants  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Chevron Corp.  to discuss a merger, according to people familiar with the matter, although the talks didn’t progress.<br />BP said Tuesday its earnings had suffered from weaker gas marketing and trading results, while refining margins and utilization remained under pressure. However, this was partly offset by income from asset sales, including some proceeds from the $5 billion sale of its petrochemicals business to Ineos Ltd.<br />The company reported a replacement cost profit—a metric similar to the net income figure that U.S. oil companies report—of $825 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, from a loss of $4 million in the year-earlier period. For the full year, it reported a loss of $18.1 billion, from a profit of $3.5 billion in 2019.<br />BP said Covid-19 restrictions would continue to sap demand early in 2021 and that the pandemic may have an enduring impact on the global economy, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period.</td>

Instead, the actions signal a desire to balance competing pressures: immigration advocates hoping for swift action to undo former President Donald Trump’s policies and the danger that undoing too many restrictions at once could trigger a surge of migrants attempting to enter the U.S.<br />The reunification task force, which Mr. Biden pledged to create during his campaign, will charge the government with identifying all of the children who remain separated from their parents and locating those parents across Latin America, where they were likely deported.<br />The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the separated children in a continuing class-action lawsuit against the U.S. government, and other nonprofit organizations have been placing advertisements and making trips across the region to help locate deported parents.

      <td>So much for the “rigged” market, the supposed conspiracy to fleece Reddit traders, and other nonsense spouted about last week’s stock market ructions involving  GameStop  and other companies. It turns out the controversy was essentially about a larger than normal clearinghouse call for capital.<br />As David Battan explains nearby, that’s almost certainly the story behind the decision by Robinhood, the internet trading app, to limit trades in certain stocks for a time late last week. Politicians like Sen. Ted Cruz and bar-stool financial analysts claimed to see a plot by the new Robber Barons.<br />The reality is more prosaic. Robinhood and other brokers were deluged by traders looking to invest in GameStop and other shares, often with options contracts that can increase leverage and trading risk. A clearinghouse that processes and settles trades watched the volatile trading and demanded more collateral to cope with potential losses.<br />Robinhood Chief Executive Vlad Tenev explained the demand Sunday night in an interview on a livestream on Clubhouse, a social-networking app. “The request was around $3 billion, which is, you know, about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is,” Mr. Tenev said.<br />A margin call is not a conspiracy. A clearinghouse is an intermediary between buyers and sellers in a financial market. It “clears,” or finalizes, trades and makes sure the parties fulfill the contract and assets are delivered. It also mitigates risk by requiring that trades be backed by enough capital to reduce the chances that one of the trading parties goes bankrupt. This protects investors as well as brokers.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Investigators have made a preliminary determination that the police officer who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt during the U.S. Capitol riot shouldn’t be charged with any crimes in connection with her death, according to people familiar with the review.<br />Ms. Babbitt, who served for more than a dozen years in the Air Force and Air National Guard and became a passionate supporter of former President Donald Trump, died from being shot by a Capitol Police officer after rioters smashed through a door to the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6. She had entered the building as part of a crowd aiming to disrupt the certification of President Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.<br />The officer who shot her had been placed on leave soon after the riot while Ms. Babbitt’s death was being investigated, including on the question of whether it was a violation of her civil rights.<br />The Justice Department said in announcing the investigation that it was following routine procedure for whenever a police officer uses deadly force by having the Washington Metropolitan Police Department examine the shooting. The police investigators have made an initial determination that charges against the officer aren’t warranted, the people said, adding that Justice Department officials haven’t yet made a final determination on the matter. The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington is leading the broader investigation into the riot and prosecuting the more than 150 cases that have resulted to date.<br />A Justice Department spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Any final charging decision would likely have to be approved by senior Justice Department leadership, who haven’t yet been briefed on the matter.</td>

      <td>The U.S. response needs to take into account China’s regional designs.</td>
      <td>From protests in Moscow to Chinese air incursions over Taiwan, the world is wasting no time testing Joe Biden’s foreign policy team of liberal internationalists. On Monday Americans woke up to news of a swift and (so far) bloodless coup in Burma, whose transition to democratic government was touted by the Obama Administration as one of its major achievements.<br />Now the country’s generals are moving to reassert control after their party was walloped in November elections. Aung San Suu Kyi, the top elected leader of Burma (also called Myanmar), wanted to use her mandate to change the constitution to limit the generals’ power. That looks like the trigger for the military’s forced suspension of civilian government and communications blackout.<br />The Biden Administration is rightly denouncing the move, but the U.S. has limited leverage acting alone. The West has used market access as a carrot to urge Burma’s military rulers to cede power to Ms. Suu Kyi. Yet the extent that a power transition actually occurred was exaggerated. A return to economically isolating the country of 54 million on China’s southern border could hurt the Burmese people and play into Beijing’s hands.<br />As our Walter Russell Meadwrote in 2019, “Western fecklessness has made China look to Myanmar like a more stable and reliable partner.” President Trump’s great-power diplomacy was sometimes crudely transactional. Yet the Biden team might be tempted to pivot too far in the opposite direction, stressing liberal values at the expense of core American interests.<br />The top U.S. priority in Asia is limiting Beijing’s ability to control independent states like Burma, which is strategically situated in the Indo-Pacific. China is holding back from condemning the coup, likely in hopes of making diplomatic inroads with a military government.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump went easy on Russia and Vladimir Putin rhetorically while supporting tougher policies than his predecessor. Now President Biden is taking the opposite approach. At least that’s the early message from the Administration’s first decision on arms control and its response to Russia’s growing domestic protests.<br />On Sunday Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he is “deeply disturbed by the violent crackdown” on Russian protesters and the arrests of thousands demanding the release of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Mr. Blinken said Russians are fed up with “corruption” and “autocracy” and added that Mr. Biden delivered a similar message in a phone call with Mr. Putin.<br />Good to hear, but the Administration sent a very different signal by embracing an unconditional five-year extension of the New Start nuclear arms treaty, which Mr. Putin made formal on Friday. The accord is a classic 20th century arms-control treaty that was inadequate when it came into force a decade ago.<br />New Start limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and bombs at 1,550. It also caps the deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles and nuclear-equipped heavy bombers. The deal would have expired Feb. 5, but Mr. Biden took the longest extension possible.<br />This squanders useful diplomatic work by the Trump Administration. While Washington withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) and Open Skies treaties, which Russia was violating, it tried to negotiate a shorter extension to New Start last year.</td>

      <td>Most world leaders hope the new Biden Administration augurs a more, how shall we say, “cooperative spirit” when it comes to allies. An early test, concerning tax policy, highlights how disappointed some may be.<br />The Biden team takes power as other governments are launching a push to grab more revenue from American tech companies. Fiscal jealousy has been rife for years as large U.S. companies such as Google,  Facebook  and  Apple  earned billions of dollars in high-tax-rate jurisdictions while existing tax rules allowed them to book the profits and pay tax in lower-rate countries.<br />This phenomenon provoked varied responses. The stick is an array of digital services taxes imposed by France, Spain and the U.K. targeting revenue—not profits—of the U.S. tech companies. The carrot is a negotiation led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development supposedly to provide tech companies legal certainty by revamping the rules governing taxation of global companies.<br />The Trump Administration cooled on that effort and threatened tariffs against governments imposing discriminatory taxes on U.S. tech firms. Foreign officials hope President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will be more amenable, and Ms. Yellen’s confirmation hearing was marked by promises to work with the OECD.<br />Look closer, however, and problems appear. One proposal would upend decades-old global rules that tax a company where it is headquartered rather than where it does business. The OECD and some governments want to base taxation on where revenue is earned. The OECD also wants a global minimum tax. Each country would commit to taxing at least 12.5% of the profits of companies headquartered there—primarily to make sure the company isn’t paying “too little” via legal planning.</td>

      <td>The successful vaccine program followed the model of U.S. mobilization in World War II.</td>
      <td>Every day new questions and criticisms arise about Operation Warp Speed, the public-private vaccine development initiative launched by presidential order in May 2020. Most of that criticism focuses on the distribution bottlenecks that have developed in different states, as Americans are impatient with the slow pace of the rollout. Jen Psaki, President Biden’s press secretary, has claimed to see an “urgent need to address failures of the Trump team approach to vaccine distribution.” Some in the new administration even want to rename the program.<br />Nearly all these claims rest on a misunderstanding both of Operation Warp Speed’s mission and its nature as a government program. While President Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and others dubbed the original project MP2, or Manhattan Project 2, after the crash effort to build an atomic bomb, Operation Warp Speed’s leadership borrowed a more practical model: the industrial mobilization during World War II that produced the so-called Arsenal of Democracy.<br />That model can still push the vaccine rollout over the finish line. Governors and other state officials in particular need to realize the federal government is operating in the wake of a health-care version of Pearl Harbor, and adjust their operations accordingly.<br />From the beginning the principal mission of Operation Warp Speed was the development, manufacturing, and distribution—i.e., shipping—of coronavirus vaccines. To date, the program has managed to produce and deliver about 50 million vaccine doses—all made in the U.S.—with hundreds of millions more on the way. It also had 97,000 certified receivers distributing the vaccine across the U.S.<br />It is the most remarkable achievement in modern medicine, made possible by following the model of the World War II mobilization effort. That model rests on three principles.</td>

      <td>His ‘Buy American’ plan is worse than Trump’s for suppliers.</td>
      <td>President Biden doubled down on Donald Trump’s “Buy American” campaign, signing a Jan. 25 executive order that would not only maintain Mr. Trump’s destructive protectionism, but increase the burdens on international trade.<br />Mr. Biden’s new order will keep Mr. Trump’s mandate that the federal government buy goods made domestically. But it adds a new, highly disruptive mandate to raise the threshold for foreign components going into those finished goods, along with the establishment of a panel to reduce the many exemptions the Trump administration had made.<br />Despite its antitrade image, the Trump administration hadn’t even finalized its own “Buy American” rules until two days before leaving office, suggesting a gap between rhetoric and economic reality that the new administration seeks to close.<br />In the wake of Mr. Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, this was a second body blow to Canadian workers. This is because components are key to Canada’s exports to the U.S., which make up around 80% of all of Canada’s exports. Considering that Canada’s two largest exports are natural resources and automotive components, together accounting for nearly two-thirds of Canada’s total exports, the new president seems to be going for his neighbor’s jugular.<br />North American supply chains integrate industries on both sides of the border, especially in the automotive sector. U.S. scrap steel, for instance, is exported to Ontario, where U.S. manufacturers such as Ford and  General Motors  use it to produce vehicles for export back to the U.S. Mandates on where components are made risk shutting countries out of existing supply chains.</td>

      <td>Team Biden will be disappointed if it mistakes them for starry-eyed idealists.</td>
      <td>Sooner or later every new presidential administration experiences that sinking feeling that one of its big ideas may not be working well. For Team Biden, that moment arrived last week as Germany, with widespread support in the European Union, made clear that Europe has no real interest in countering either Russia or China.<br />Warning against the “building of blocs,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told her virtual audience at the World Economic Forum that she thought Europe should not join with either the U.S. or China against the other. Coming on top of an earlier European refusal to defer moving on an EU-China investment accord until the incoming Biden administration could weigh in on the matter, Europe has made its views crystal clear. Uighurs, Hong Kong and the growing military threats in and around the South China Sea matter much less to European policy makers than their commercial interests do.<br />Alexei Navalny’s challenge to President Vladimir Putin has likewise prompted a European response that is less than robust. As democracy activists and human-rights organizations on both sides of the Atlantic sought to pressure Western governments to do something about Mr. Navalny’s detention and the arrests across Russia, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs announced that he was pressing ahead with a previously planned visit to Moscow for meetings with Mr. Putin. Light wrist slaps may follow, but little more.<br />For starry-eyed American liberals—in whose rich fantasies Europe’s chancelleries are inhabited by committed idealists—this may come as a shock. Europeans aren’t from Mars, and some may hail from Venus, as Robert Kagan put it in his 2004 essay “Of Paradise and Power.” But those who rule the Continent come mostly from Pluto, a cold and remote planet named for the ancient god of the underworld—and of wealth.<br />It’s a mistake to see Europeans as idealists merely because they like multilateralism and discount the importance of military power. Multilateralism is a realist program for Europe, not an idealist one. Even the largest European states know that they are too small to figure as great powers on their own; they must work together if they want to sway Washington and Beijing. As Mr. Kagan noted, they also understand that a rules-based international order grounded in multilateral institutions increases European world influence.</td>

      <td>Will Joe Biden speak up for those he credits with making him the man he is today?</td>
      <td>Amid all the pain and disruption, a year of coronavirus has given Americans a new respect for those working to keep daily life as normal as possible, from the frontline nurse to the Amazon delivery man. Near the top of this honor roll is an especially unsung hero: the Catholic-school teacher.<br />The National Catholic Education Association reports that its schools boast a total enrollment of 1,626,291. In ordinary times their teachers do an extraordinary job, especially for their poor and minority students. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor once said, “Catholic schools have been a pipeline to opportunity” for people like her—poor, Latina, raised by a single mom. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, Catholic-school administrators have moved heaven and earth to keep their classrooms open to new generations of Sotomayors.<br />“The science is clear that there is no substitute for in-person learning, especially for poor and minority children most at danger of falling behind,” says Tom Carroll, superintendent of Catholic schools for the Archdiocese of Boston. “Across the nation, the Catholic school approach is to stay open wherever we are allowed.”<br />It’s been a roller coaster. During the first days of the lockdowns, many Catholic schools closed forever because of a cash crunch. Kathy Mears, the NCEA’s interim president and CEO, reckons that Covid forced the closure of 107 Catholic schools, though an exact number is difficult because in many cases other factors were also involved.<br />But a funny thing happened after the shutdowns. Once moms and dads realized that the Catholic schools left standing were staying open through the pandemic, they began moving children out of public school. It’s not been enough to stave off the 6.4% drop in national enrollment the Catholic schools have seen since Covid-19 hit, but it does highlight that these schools are among the few real alternatives parents have today.</td>

      <td>A ‘reign’s length’ of social change in Britain, from the ascension of Elizabeth II to the Beatles, Brussels, Brexit and beyond.</td>
      <td>In one of many audacious assertions in a book that tells the story of Britain from 1952 to the present day, Andrew Marr writes that if Shakespeare was “the hot-glowing cultural figure of the first Elizabethan age, then the Beatles—John, Paul, George and Ringo—performed a parallel role in the second.” The second age is, of course, that of Elizabeth II, whose 69-year reign is the longest of any British monarch, exceeding by more than two decades (and counting) her Tudor namesake’s time on the throne.<br />Mr. Marr, a journalist of stature in Britain—where he is a TV and radio host on the BBC and a former editor of the Independent—calls his book “Elizabethans.” He spurns the definite article in his title, perhaps to make it more easily distinguished from “The Elizabethans” (2011), by A.N. Wilson, with its focus on the late 16th century. And yet, as you read Mr. Marr’s rich and ebullient account of “how modern Britain was forged,” you learn that it makes no sense, in our own time, to speak of an Elizabethan type or national character in the way we do (however superficially) of “the Victorians.” The Britons of today are notably—and sometimes jarringly—different from those of 1952, when a callow Elizabeth II, then 25, acceded to the throne upon the death of her father.<br />The packaging of Britain’s story into a “reign’s length” is attractive nonetheless, because it acknowledges that Queen Elizabeth has been the one truly constant factor in a nation that has been an outlier among major Western powers: Britain has attached and detached itself to and from Europe as it has pleased—while enjoying more enduring links on the wider map than even the United States. Contemporary Britain, writes Mr. Marr, is also “unusual in European terms in its porousness to migration from non-European parts of the world.” All of which make it an attractive national laboratory in which to measure social-political change over generations.<br />Mr. Marr has written an ambitious book in which he accords more attention to subtle social shifts than he does to “the big, visible changes”—things such as the disappearance of bowler hats, the emptying of churches and the springing up of mosques, of which we know already. What fewer of us know, by contrast, are the nuances and shades of change. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, notes Mr. Marr, “the British seem to become cheekier, even rebellious,” and “an insolent contempt for established authority begins to creep in.” The Beatles—whose language, he concedes, was more “banal” than the Bard’s—were part of that rebellion.<br />This shift in mood, though seemingly a spasm of youthful high spirits, would prove to be a herald of broader changes. The 1960s, Mr. Marr tells us, were a period of “generational conflict.” But for most working-class Britons, they were also “a period of greater material wealth.” The Britain of the previous decade, he reminds us, was “a quietly religious, homogeneous, stratified, socially conservative, proud and comparatively closed-off country.” The insular working classes, as he puts it, “had never been to Spain.” Over time, the country acquired the means to travel and eat better food.</td>

Lower courts found the Trump administration exceeded its authority, but the Supreme Court’s conservative majority allowed the reallocations to continue and construction to proceed while appeals were pending.<br />In the asylum case, Ms. Prelogar cited a Jan. 20 directive from the acting secretary of homeland security, David Pekoske, suspending new enrollment in the asylum program, which formally is called the Migrant Protection Protocols.</td>

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.)  from her committee assignments if Republicans don’t take action, according to people familiar with the plans.<br />The move increases pressure on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) at a time when he is caught in the party’s political cross-currents after former President Donald Trump’s loss. Stripping a lawmaker of committee assignments takes away an important venue to shape legislation and participate in panel debates, diminishing his or her influence.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said he has spoken to Mr. McCarthy, who has said he plans to meet with Mrs. Greene this week, likely on Tuesday. Mrs. Greene “must be held accountable for her reprehensible statements, and I am discussing with members the best course of action to do so,” Mr. Hoyer said Monday.<br />Mr. McCarthy didn’t respond to a request for comment on the Democrats’ push. If Mr. McCarthy doesn’t strip Mrs. Greene from her assignments on the budget and education committees, Democrats plan to bring up a measure to the Rules Committee on Wednesday afternoon, setting up a floor vote to remove her. The Rules Committee on Monday afternoon posted the resolution, scheduling it for a Wednesday meeting.<br />“It is my hope and expectation that Republicans will do the right thing and hold Rep. Greene accountable, and we will not need to consider this resolution. But we are prepared to do so if necessary,” Mr. Hoyer said.</td>

      <td>Exxon Mobil Corp.  is forming a business unit that will focus exclusively on technologies to lower carbon emissions, as the oil giant faces increasing pressure to step up its sustainability investments.<br />Exxon said Monday that the new business, dubbed “low carbon solutions,” would invest $3 billion through 2025 on lower emission energy technologies, primarily on carbon capture and storage projects, which gather carbon emissions from industrial processes or directly from the air and deposit them underground. Those investments would represent roughly 3% to 4% of Exxon’s planned annual capital expenditures.<br />Exxon has a large research-and-development division that has invested in carbon capture for years, and Exxon says it has captured more carbon than any other company. Currently, the only large-scale use for captured carbon is to help produce more fossil fuels by pumping in the gas to squeeze more oil and gas out of the ground.<br />“With our demonstrated leadership in carbon capture and emissions reduction technologies, Exxon Mobil is committed to meeting the demand for affordable energy while reducing emissions,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said.<br />Exxon is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday after previously disclosing that it would write down as much as $20 billion in assets. It endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020 and has already posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.</td>

The social casino games offer customers real-world rewards in entertainment, shopping and travel through a loyalty program. The company was founded in 2011 by former  Wynn Resorts Ltd.  executive Andrew Pascal, who is expected to continue leading the combined company.<br />Talks about the Playstudios deal were first reported by Bloomberg last week.<br />Several investors including MGM Resorts,  BlackRock Inc.,  ClearBridge Investments and Neuberger Berman Funds have agreed to a $250 million investment, the companies said, and the combined company will have an estimated $290 million in cash.</td>

On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the meeting between Mr. Biden and the Republicans “is not a forum for the president to make or accept an offer.” She added: “It is important to him that he hears this group out on their concerns, on their ideas.”<br />Pared down from Mr. Biden’s original plan, the proposal from the 10 Republicans omits measures favored by many Democrats, such as aid for state and local governments and raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Republicans said their plan was an opportunity for the Biden administration to follow through on its calls for bipartisanship.<br />“Mr. President, we recognize your calls for unity and want to work in good faith with your administration to meet the health, economic, and societal challenges of the Covid crisis,” the group of senators led by Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) said Monday.</td>

The technology is easily transferable to Iran’s military missile program run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, experts say.<br />The Zuljanah features a solid-fuel-propelled motor that is the largest yet exhibited by Iran. Motors propelled by solid fuel, rather than liquid, are a key component in intercontinental ballistic missiles, which the U.S. seeks to prevent Iran from developing.<br />“After tests…[it] will be ready to put operational satellites in orbit,” said Ahmad Hosseini of the Defense Ministry, according to the IRNA state news agency.<br />While Iran regularly tests new missile technology, Monday’s launch, which was broadcast on national television, was the first since President Biden took office.</td>

Broad economic sanctions such as those used by the George W. Bush and Obama administrations could alienate the country’s population and hurt public attitude toward the West, analysts say.<br />U.S. trade with Myanmar is small. Meanwhile, Beijing enjoys a multibillion-dollar trade and investment relationship with its neighbor and has expressed less public concern than the U.S. about who is in charge. That raises the possibility that any U.S. action could further drive Myanmar toward China, exacerbating tensions between Washington and Beijing as they compete for influence in the region.<br />U.S. options include broadening human-rights sanctions against leaders of the coup that are already in place over the country’s treatment of its Rohingya Muslim minority, and tracking and disclosing the military leaders’ international business dealings.<br />The United Nations Security Council is set to meet on Tuesday to discuss Myanmar in a closed session.</td>

      <td>Online investors who spurred a trading frenzy in the shares of  GameStop Corp.  and  AMC Entertainment Inc.  have moved onto a bigger target: the global silver market.<br />Futures prices for silver in New York on Monday settled at their highest level in eight years, the latest work by a loosely knit group of speculators who congregate on social-media platforms including Reddit’s WallStreetBets. Some participants have been contending aggressive buying could power GameStop-like, quadruple-digit percentage gains in other arenas, with some chatter over the weekend focusing on the roughly $50 billion physical market for silver.<br />Many traders with experience in commodities say the trade is highly speculative. There is more than enough silver to meet industrial demand for everything from semiconductors to solar panels, and producers can raise output to take advantage of higher prices. Previous efforts to corner the market have ultimately preceded crashes, most famously when the Hunt brothers artificially boosted silver in 1979 and 1980.<br />Still, the recent wave of speculation is unlike anything many in commodities have witnessed in the recently past. Shares of miners like  First Majestic Silver Corp.  and  Hecla Mining Co.  have been among the stock market’s best performers recently—each rose 20% or more on Monday—while the largest exchange-traded fund tied to silver logged its biggest-ever daily inflow on Friday. Online silver dealers around the country have even reported soaring demand from retail buyers.<br />“It’s become like the GameStop of commodities,” said Edward Meir, a consultant focused on metals at brokerage ED&F Man Capital Markets. “It doesn’t make any sense… It could be equally ugly on the way down.”</td>

      <td>Even people with asymptomatic Covid cases can have after-effects in their bodies, research indicates, raising questions about possible risks later in life.<br />An estimated one-quarter to one-third of Covid infections are asymptomatic, according to recent studies. Multiple studies have shown asymptomatic patients can have irregular lung scans. A couple of small studies have found cardiac issues in student athletes, including those with asymptomatic infections. And a study looking at asymptomatic and mild cases of Covid in children found signs of possible small blood vessel damage.<br />It’s not yet clear what health consequences any of these after-effects may have, if any, doctors say. Few other viruses have been scrutinized as closely as Covid-19, so it’s possible other viruses leave similar effects without causing major problems. In many cases the damage will likely resolve on its own, doctors note. But they say more research needs to be done to determine what, if anything, the long term effects might be, and whether people should seek monitoring or screening.<br />“There is a risk of internal hits to these people that they are unaware of,” says Eric J. Topol, founder and director of Scripps Research Translational Institute, a medical research facility in La Jolla, Calif. “When things happen slowly in a person, below the surface, you can end up with a chronic situation.”<br />Dr. Topol co-authored a study published online in January in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that estimated that at least one-third of Covid-19 positive individuals are asymptomatic. The estimate was based on a review of 61 studies with more than 1.8 million people.</td>

Growth is likely to average 2.6% a year through 2025, the CBO said. The agency said a roughly $900 billion relief bill enacted in December would add about 1.5% to the level of GDP this year and next.<br />The latest projections will be closely watched by lawmakers weighing how much additional government support the U.S. economy might need as it recovers from the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact.<br />Senate Republicans released new details of their roughly $618 billion coronavirus-relief proposal on Monday ahead of a meeting later in the day with President Biden.

      <td>THERE’S AT LEAST one upside to not being able to attend a raucous Super Bowl party this year: no competition for the snacks. Perhaps in years past you arrived late to the party and ended up with the only chair without a back, far from the snack table, where the dip disappeared from the bowl long before you could fight your way to it. This year you can tweak the recipe measurements to provide your household personal-size batches of party food, or keep the measurements the same and enjoy the leftovers throughout the week. Whether you want to spice it up with an award-winning wings recipe or satisfy a sweet tooth with raspberry miso cheesecake, these recipes will have you dancing in the end zone.<br />A good rule of thumb for finger foods: The messier it leaves your hands, the better it tastes. Case in point: chicken wings. If you’re up for outdoor grilling try this tangy version tossed with Alabama white sauce and seasoned with plenty of lemon juice. Refine your taco-assembly skills with chef Chris Wallace’s mushroom tacos, which can be whipped up sans meat or with bacon, depending on your preference. For something lighter and highly munchable, try these highly customizable popcorn recipes, with flavors ranging from Bloody Mary to spiced caramel.<br />There aren’t many times in a year when it’s completely acceptable—encouraged, in fact—to count dips as dinner, so why not take full advantage? This buttery oven-baked crab dip carries just the right amount of celery crunch. Serve it with crisp toast rounds—and a simple green salad, if you must. A classic French-onion dip is always a touchdown, and this luscious version topped with caramelized onions scores the extra point. And we strongly encourage you to give the unjustly maligned cheese ball another chance.<br />A good drink goes a long way when it comes to alleviating game-day stress. If you’re craving a bar-quality cocktail but don’t necessarily have a bar-quality setup, don’t worry: with some Tupperware and a tablespoon you can do wonders. Here’s our guide on how to MacGyver a pro-level drink at home. Or maybe you’d rather keep it simple, in which case this recipe for the world’s easiest Margarita will keep your at-home viewing party well lubricated with minimal distraction from the game.<br />No snackadium is complete without a hefty dose of sugar. (There are four quarters to get through, after all.) If you like a dash of salt with your sweets, singer Kelis’s chocolate chunk cookies with potato chips only take 30 minutes to prepare. Or indulge this nutty, caramel-y, brown-butter blondie that will make any dessert-lover question their brownie loyalty.</td>

He had previously said he planned to retire in 2021, and Emerson’s succession planning for the change spanned five years.<br />Emerson continues to navigate a pandemic that upended its business along with the rest of the global economy. Mr. Farr took a hands-on approach to the crisis and never stopped going to the office with his top executives in 2020, even as much of the world was working from home. The company continued to provide financial projections and kept its dividend intact during a time when companies were hunkering down during unprecedented uncertainty.</td>

      <td>The $230 million deal with Australian company Ellume will cover 8.5 million over-the-counter tests</td>
      <td>The Biden administration said it has reached a $230 million deal with Australian diagnostics company Ellume USA LLC to produce at-home, over-the-counter Covid-19 tests.<br />The Food and Drug Administration previously authorized the test. So far, the FDA has cleared three Covid-19 tests that can be processed entirely at home, but Ellume’s is the only one that doesn’t require a prescription. None are widely available at this point.<br />The company is expected to produce 19 million tests a month by the end of the year, Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to the White House Covid-19 response team, said Monday. Based on the agreement, 8.5 million tests will be guaranteed to the U.S. government.<br />For months, public health authorities have been calling for rapid, easy-to-use tests for Covid-19 that can be performed anywhere, both to enable people to quickly determine whether or not they have Covid-19 and to allow for wider screening. At-home tests are expected to be less precise than those done in a lab and will likely require a follow-up test in certain situations.<br />Ellume shipped out its first batch of 10,000 tests to the U.S. the week of Jan. 18, the company said last week. Ellume had originally aimed to ship 100,000 tests a day starting in January.</td>

      <td>Futures are 57% higher than a year ago, when the weather was uncommonly warm</td>
      <td>The winter storm blanketing the Northeast and forecasts for a frigid February are boosting natural-gas prices.<br />Natural-gas futures rose 11.1% to close at $2.85 per million British thermal units on Monday. That is 57% higher than a year ago, when the weather was uncommonly warm, yet still about 15% below the price to start this heating season.<br />“An unusually strong response to weekend adjustments to the short-term temperature forecasts,” said Ritterbusch and Associates. The trading firm said prices could approach $3 this month if the weather outlook materializes.<br />Furnaces are firing in the Northeast, where snow started piling up over the weekend. But in much of the country temperatures will remain mild, according to NatGasWeather.com. That should change next week, when an Arctic blast is expected to blow into the Rockies, across the Great Plains and past the Great Lakes. The industry forecaster predicts temperatures will drop low enough in North Texas and other gas-producing regions to freeze well heads and block output.<br />“The largest unknown right now seems to be just how far east the cold will extend and if major populations in Chicago and the East Coast will feel the frost,” Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. analysts wrote in a note to clients.</td>

      <td>The $3.4 billion raised since last Thursday is more than the company has raised in its entire prior existence</td>
      <td>Robinhood Markets Inc. raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders, days after investors agreed to pump $1 billion into the online brokerage to help it ride out a trading frenzy in popular stocks including  GameStop  Inc.<br />The huge infusion—the $3.4 billion raised since last Thursday is more than the company has raised in total up until this point in the eight years since its launch—gives Robinhood a war chest to cover a surge in collateral requirements stemming from the trading boom, people familiar with the matter said. It also should allow the company to support the hundreds of thousands of new accounts users opened since Thursday and to remove many of the trading restrictions that angered customers of the popular brokerage, the people said.<br />The fundraising deal was structured as a note that conveys the option to buy additional shares at a discount later, the people said.<br />Customers flooded Robinhood and other brokerages with orders to buy and sell a handful of popular stocks last week. GameStop, the stock that kicked off the retail surge, closed Friday at $325. It began the year at under $20.  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,  the battered movie-theater chain, is up more than 500% in 2021.<br />The wild price swings prompted the clearinghouse that processes and settles the trades to ask for more cash to cover potential losses on the transactions.</td>
