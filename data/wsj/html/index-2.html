      <td>Signs of strength under the surface of the energy market suggest further gains for crude prices, some investors and analysts say</td>
      <td>A booming rally in oil markets has pushed crude prices to their highest levels since near the start of the coronavirus pandemic, powered by production curbs and recovering demand.<br />Brent-crude futures, the benchmark in energy markets, have risen more than 50% since the end of October and are approaching $60 a barrel for the first time since Covid-19 began to erode oil demand in early 2020. Futures for West Texas Intermediate—or WTI, the main grade of U.S. crude—last week surpassed $55 a barrel for the first time in over a year.<br />The speed of the recovery has surprised some investors and analysts, given that coronavirus continues to curtail demand. It has juiced shares of companies including  Exxon Mobil Corp .  and  ConocoPhillips  after a troubled 2020 for oil-and-gas producers, making energy stocks the best performers on the S&P 500 this year.<br />“The market definitely has some momentum,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC, a hedge fund that invests in energy derivatives. “WTI is going to be targeting $60, too.”<br />Oil is rising against a mixed economic backdrop, with data published Friday suggesting that the labor market faces a long road to recovery. But the stock market continues to power higher, in part because investors expect a new dose of fiscal stimulus and vaccines to goose growth.</td>

      <td>Loud chants of “We don’t want military dictatorship, we want democracy” echoed on the streets of Yangon as tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Myanmar’s largest city to oppose last week’s coup, putting them on a collision course with authorities, who have violently suppressed such demonstrations in the past.<br />Since they seized power six days ago, Myanmar’s generals and their allies have tried to prevent mass protests from mobilizing.<br />They ordered an internet blackout through Saturday and most of Sunday before service started to resume midafternoon. Political activists and civilian politicians, prominently Aung San Suu Kyi, the hugely popular leader whose government they deposed, are detained. On Saturday, when demonstrations began, widely circulated text messages falsely claimed Ms. Suu Kyi had been released—an effort, activists said, to decrease turnout.<br />Still, people began streaming out of their homes as early as 9 a.m. on Sunday. Many carried posters of Ms. Suu Kyi, who is confined in her residence in the nation’s capital. They shouted, “release our leaders,” and wore red T-shirts and headbands—the color associated with her party. Supporters huddled in the opened-up trunks of their cars and waved her party’s flag.<br />Police in riot gear were present and barricades were set up to block demonstrators from marching toward downtown Yangon.</td>

The censure document accused Ms. Cheney of voting to impeach even though the House didn’t offer Mr. Trump “formal hearing or due process.”<br />“We need to honor President Trump. All President Trump did was call for a peaceful assembly and protest for a fair and audited election,” said Darin Smith, a Cheyenne attorney who lost to Cheney in a Republican House primary in 2016. “The Republican Party needs to put her on notice.”<br />Ms. Cheney said in a statement after the vote that she remained honored to represent Wyoming and will always fight for the issues that matter most to the state.<br />“Foremost among these is the defense of our Constitution and the freedoms it guarantees. My vote to impeach was compelled by the oath I swore to the Constitution,” she added.</td>

      <td>Drinking is on the rise as a response to stress, but a growing number of people are choosing to give up alcohol before it becomes a problem</td>
      <td>Back in mid-March, as schools and businesses began to close and people headed home to hunker down, Amanda, a 44-year-old yoga instructor in Portland, Maine (who asked that her real name not be used for privacy reasons), decided to address one of the many worries that had begun to consume her day. “And that was whether I was drinking too much,” she says. Already, friends who suddenly had more time on their hands were ending their work days at 4 p.m. with a glass of wine or breaking out the “good tequila” on a Tuesday just to have “something to look forward to.”<br />Several studies conducted last fall determined that binge drinking has increased during the pandemic. A study of more than 1,500 adults published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in September found that the frequency of alcohol consumption increased 14% over the previous year for all adults. For women, binge drinking went up a whopping 41%.<br />Amanda wasn’t a problem drinker, but she worried that she could easily become one during the pandemic. “Removing the option entirely felt far easier than expecting myself to moderate, given all that was going on,” she says. She’s part of a growing number of people inspired by the pandemic to adopt a sort of preemptive sobriety. In July, a survey of 2,000 people commissioned by the addiction-awareness group Alcohol Change UK found that 7% of participants had stopped drinking completely during the lockdown.<br />The alcohol-alternative beverage market, meanwhile, has exploded and is now expected to exceed $29 billion by 2026. Jen Batchelor, the cofounder of Kin Euphorics, a line of non-alcoholic drinks, says that sales of their most popular canned cocktail, Kin Spritz, have quadrupled during the pandemic. “People are recognizing they don’t want to poison their power supply while the state of the world is what it is,” says Ms. Batchelor. “They want to maintain their agency at a time that’s already mood roulette. But the mentality is not, ‘I kicked alcohol.’ It’s ‘I shifted away from alcohol.’ It’s a choice, rather than what we often think of as a necessity, someone’s need to stop drinking—or else.”<br />“I think a lot of people are coming at sobriety from a fresh, modern, data-driven lens these days, where it’s so easy to measure the inputs in your life and what variables make you feel a different way—what affects your sleep, your hydration, your mindfulness,” says Bill Shufelt, co-founder and CEO of Athletic Brewing Company, a nonalcoholic craft brewery whose 2020 sales were up more than 500% over the year before. “And I think isolation and being in their houses has especially helped people identify the variables that are making them feel better or worse.”</td>

      <td>Early in the pandemic, as employees adapted to working remotely,  Adobe  Chief Executive Shantanu Narayen asked his team to consider a question: “Are we prioritizing enough?”<br />Adobe is a maker of software offering creative tools such as Photoshop and other products designed to help businesses with marketing and managing relationships with customers. With millions of professionals doing their jobs at home, improving digital documents became more urgent for Mr. Narayen. So did adding and refining features so people could better collaborate while working remotely.<br />“Everybody going digital was not going to come again,” he said.<br />To lead in a crisis, Mr. Narayen said, managers must give people permission to stop doing projects not deemed essential for the moment, while also changing how work is done. Adobe has made efforts to not host meetings before 9 a.m., for example, and to regularly give employees additional time off on some Fridays so that they can relax and spend time with their families. “These are different times,” he said. “It’s not business as usual.”<br />Mr. Narayen, who became CEO in 2007, is one of the longest serving chieftains in the technology world. In 2013 Adobe said it would stop selling boxed versions of its software and instead directed customers to cloud-based subscriptions, embracing such a transformation before many other industry giants did. Adobe’s revenue rose to a record $12.87 billion in the 2020 fiscal year; this year the company expects revenue will surpass $15 billion. It now employs roughly 22,500 people.</td>

      <td>One secret of Amazon’s ability to grow rapidly: software and algorithms that manage its millions of employees and marketplace sellers—technologies Andy Jassy knows well</td>
      <td>Andy Jassy is taking over a very unusual “tech” company.<br />Amazon  has many times more employees than any of its competitors, such as Microsoft, Google and Apple, and many are low-skilled manual laborers, rather than software engineers. Amazon is also a partner with approximately 2.4 million active marketplace sellers, who generate the majority of sales on its retail platform. But the incoming chief executive, Mr. Jassy—a loyal deputy and devoted student of founder Jeff Bezos—has at his disposal a powerful tool for managing such a vast ocean of workers and partners: an equally vast cloud-software infrastructure that he has overseen from its start.<br />Amazon uses software to manage in a way that’s unlike almost any other company, except maybe gig-economy giants Uber,  Lyft ,   DoorDash  and Instacart. Whether they’re driving a delivery van, picking items from shelves or trying to maintain their product inventory to avoid being delisted, Amazon’s employees, subcontractors and seller-partners are monitored, evaluated, rewarded and even flagged for reprimand or coaching by software.<br />While Mr. Jassy is often described by those who have worked for him as being a lot like Jeff Bezos, but perhaps warmer and fuzzier, there is arguably at present a sharp contrast between the way he treats his immediate reports and the way Amazon’s algorithms and artificial intelligence treat its millions of front-line workers and marketplace sellers. If Mr. Jassy can figure out how to use algorithms to manage workers and partners as humanely as he apparently manages the people he works with personally, that may prove to be his defining legacy as CEO.<br />Having built Amazon Web Services from a tiny startup he headed within Amazon, begun in the early 2000s, into the behemoth of the cloud market (and generator of half of Amazon’s profits), Mr. Jassy understands not only the internet plumbing for countless tech companies AWS supports, from  Netflix  to Slack, but also how it’s plugged into the myriad businesses owned by Amazon itself. Now 53 years old, Mr. Jassy joined Amazon in 1997, immediately after graduating from Harvard Business School.</td>

      <td>Technology giants such as Alphabet, Amazon and  Apple are more dominant than a year ago thanks to a greater reliance on their services during the pandemic. The forces propelling them to new heights are expected to outlast Covid-19.</td>
      <td>The tech industry’s titans were already huge before Covid-19, the subject of soaring valuations and snowballing antitrust investigations. The pandemic has only made them bigger. A lot bigger.<br />In almost every facet of life—the tools we use to work, study, and play; how we shop and interact; the way companies operate and market their products—people and businesses have become more reliant on technology over the past year. Even amid one of the most punishing economic downturns on record, spending surged on computers, videogames, online retail, cloud-computing services and digital advertising.<br />The result was dizzying growth for some of the largest corporations in history—and for their stock prices. At a time when companies such as airlines and bricks-and-mortar retailers struggled to survive, combined revenue for the five biggest U.S. tech companies— Apple Inc.,   Microsoft Corp. ,  Amazon.com Inc.,  Google-parent Alphabet Inc., and  Facebook Inc. —grew by a fifth, to $1.1 trillion. Their aggregate profit rose an even faster 24%. And their combined market capitalization soared by half over the past year to a staggering $8 trillion.<br />Their economic sway expanded in other ways, too, including employment: Amazon alone added 500,000 new workers in a single year, roughly equivalent to the entire population of Atlanta.<br />Lawmakers and regulators may yet find ways to rein them in, but the economic and societal forces propelling Big Tech to even higher heights seem likely to outlast Covid-19. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella has said that he expects spending on technology to double to 10% of gross domestic product from its current level of 5%. This month he said he now expects that to happen even faster.</td>

      <td>At a bleak moment for restaurants, sushi takeout is on a roll.<br />Customer appetites for to-go sushi are rising, from $10 grocery-store rolls to elaborate, exquisitely packaged meals costing hundreds of dollars. Japanese restaurants say the demand is helping them to stay afloat, and to reach new customers through delivery and to-go options. The number of sushi restaurants open in the U.S. grew by 5% last year as numbers for steakhouses and Italian restaurants fell, according to online-directory  Yelp .<br />Kaho Lo, a 40-year-old software engineer from San Jose, Calif., used to get sushi weekly at his  Adobe Inc.  office cafeteria. During the pandemic, he tried making it himself but found it hard to find high-quality fish. Seasoning the rice and forming it into rolls proved challenging, too, and he hasn’t done it again.<br />“When there’s a spot that offers sushi for takeout, I’m all over it,” Mr. Lo said.<br />High demand for sushi comes at a dark time for restaurants overall. Sales at restaurants and bars of $659 billion last year were down by nearly a quarter from 2019, according to National Restaurant Association estimates, and more than 110,000 bars and restaurants closed at least temporarily. Employment at bars and restaurants is down by nearly 2.4 million, Labor Department estimates show.</td>

Is there blood?<br />Kids are often good at making strong arguments for why they should be allowed to play non-gory but murderous games like “Fortnite” and “Among Us.” Even in “Minecraft,” there are skeletons, zombies and pillagers to kill. Kids will say they understand the difference between games and real life. And besides, they’ll argue, these popular games are cartoonish—cute, even.<br />Do the children know best here? If so, why do parents still have a nagging suspicion that these games are harmful in some insidious way?<br />Decades of research haven’t established a firm link between violence committed in games and violence committed in real life. Yet questions persist about the subtle effects that violent games have on developing minds. The questions have become more pressing as the pandemic drags on. U.S. consumers spent nearly $19 billion on videogames in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 26% increase from the prior-year period, according to the NPD Group. “Fortnite” and “Minecraft” were among the best-selling games in the quarter.<br />On the one hand, videogames have been a saving grace during a time of little other social interaction. Yet we still worry about how all of this time spent shooting, stabbing and bludgeoning friends, strangers and bots alike will affect kids.</td>

Last June, CoronaVac received emergency-use authorization in China, limiting it to use within certain groups of high-risk individuals.<br />From Latin America to Africa and Asia, many developing countries have pinned their hopes on CoronaVac and other Chinese vaccine candidates as richer nations snap up inoculations developed in the West. CoronaVac can be stored in an ordinary refrigerator, making it cheaper and easier to transport than others that require subzero storage temperatures.<br />Beyond mainland China and Hong Kong, Turkey and Ukraine are among nations that have reported orders for CoronaVac.

With her long wavy hair unkempt in a relatable pandemic-ish way, she looked uniquely herself. And was that a hint of a smile?<br />The enthusiastic online response to the screenshot evoked the glory days of Hollywood divorce, when plebes watched awestruck as stars like Elizabeth Taylor (eight marriages) and Zsa Zsa Gabor (nine marriages) made serial break-ups glamorous. When Marilyn Monroe divorced Joe DiMaggio in 1954 after nine months of marriage, she famously wore a little black dress, high pumps and white gloves to the courthouse. She was filmed beaming and waving outside its chambers—a scene that would have fit seamlessly into one of her movies.<br />No one formula prescribes what to wear to one’s divorce proceedings, whether they take the form of mediation, litigation, or, now, a video call. Yet few would deny that one’s appearance plays a role in the outcome, with so much at stake: money, home, custody. The websites of family-law practices often include lengthy treatises advising men and women on what to wear to court, with the emphasis on classic silk blouses, prim dresses and sober suits. Some firms go further: Claire Samuels Law, a family law and divorce mediation firm in Charlotte, N.C., offers the services of a high-end stylist, and posts style ideas such as Prada pumps and minimalist Valextra handbags to its Instagram account.</td>

Police first got wind of the fraud after discovering a passenger with a fake certificate on a flight to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. After the arrests, police found on the suspects’ phones more than 200 fake certificates, which allowed people to fly internationally, according to French prosecutors.</td>

      <td>A MoMA exhibit explores the ways European art movements of the 1920s and ‘30s responded to and furthered the social and political upheaval of the time.</td>
      <td>New York<br /><br />These days when modernism is coupled with “utopian” or “idealistic,” it’s with a disparaging tone meant to emphasize the naïveté of the idea. Yet in the early 20th century, in a society transformed by the Russian Revolution and World War I, modernism seemed to embody hope for a better future and to repudiate a problematic past. For many artists, a new pared-down aesthetic and a bold, experimental embrace of the latest technologies, materials and techniques aptly expressed the aspirations of a startlingly altered world.<br />“Engineer, Agitator, Constructor: The Artist Reinvented,” at the Museum of Modern Art, explores the ways, in the 1920s and ’30s, adventurous art was put into the service of politics and social change in Soviet Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and elsewhere in Europe. Russian Constructivism, De Stijl, the Bauhaus, Futurism, and Dada are all represented by posters, advertisements, magazine layouts, books, typography, films, broadsides, theater design, and just plain propaganda, sparsely punctuated by paintings and prints that provide welcome refreshment from the commercial inclusions. Much of the exhibition celebrates the 2018 gift of more than 300 early 20th-century works on paper from the Merrill C. Berman collection, with selections of similarly “functional” works from MoMA’s holdings.<br />We are reminded that after the cataclysms of revolution and war, some artists began to question not only the nature of what they did, but also its necessity. The pragmatic dominated. We learn that the Latvian graphic designer Gustav Klutsis posited an “artist of an entirely new type”—“a public person, a specialist in political and cultural work with the masses”—while the Russian painter Liubov Popova, who said she desired “to translate the aesthetic to the production plane,” abandoned the easel for agitprop theater sets, costume design, and other useful projects. (A couple of abstract, colored linoleum cuts, with bold jostling planes, make us wish she hadn’t.)</td>

      <td>If  GameStop  is a bubble, it’s hardly the first.<br />From tulip mania in the 17th century to the dot-com spectacle of the 1990s, bubbles have boosted—and burned—investors for centuries.<br />Here’s a look at some previous bubbles:<br />When tulips were introduced to Western Europe in the 16th century, they were prized for their brilliant colors. Eventually, though, the Dutch took the tulip trade to the next level, as the 19th century writer Charles Mackay points out in his book “Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.” The people of 17th century Holland were no strangers to markets and trade. The stock exchange in Amsterdam had been operating since 1602, and the Dutch East India Company was already selling bonds and stocks.<br />Limited supply, plus an appetite for rare bulbs, made prices skyrocket. At one point, a single rare bulb could be exchanged for dozens of items, including oxen, swine and sheep, according to Mr. Mackay. The bulb market reached its peak in 1636 and 1637 before collapsing, pushing some investors into financial ruin.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The size of your next stimulus check might depend on when you file your tax return.<br />For many Americans, income in 2020 was lower than it was in 2019 because of the pandemic-induced recession. And because the stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person will have limits based on household income, it matters which year the payments are based on.<br />So why would it matter when you file your tax return? That’s because Congress is likely to tell the IRS to use 2019 or 2020 income—whichever the government has when the payment is made, according to the Senate Finance Committee.<br />Those who file soon after the Internal Revenue Service starts accepting returns on Feb. 12 will likely have their payments based on 2020 income and family size. Those who wait would have their payments based on 2019 income and family size.<br />“If it’s filed electronically, it’s processed almost immediately, and the information is then available to the IRS almost instantaneously,” said David Kautter, who was the top tax-policy official at the Treasury Department during the first two rounds of payments.</td>

Users Photoshopped the dog’s furry face onto everything from astronauts to Twinkies.<br />In 2013, the software developer Billy Markus was watching bitcoin gain in popularity and decided to make his own lighthearted cryptocurrency. He first based it on the videogame “Animal Crossing,” and called it bells, named after the game’s pretend currency.<br />People online hated it, he said. So when another developer, Jackson Palmer, shared a new idea for a cryptocurrency based on the doge meme, Mr. Markus reconfigured his code for bells to fit the meme.</td>

Police in riot gear were deployed in large numbers and trucks with water cannons were present in the area, raising fears of a crackdown.<br />The coup took place in the early hours of Monday, when soldiers raided the homes of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other officials ahead of a new session of parliament. Ms. Suu Kyi’s party had trounced its military-backed opponents by a big margin in national elections in November. The military said it was taking control because election officials didn’t address its complaints about fraud involving the country’s voter lists.<br />Ms. Suu Kyi remains detained in her house in the nation’s capital. Political activists and a number of her key aides are also detained. The U.S. and many other foreign governments have condemned the takeover and asked the army to reverse course.<br />The military, or Tatmadaw as it is known in Myanmar, has been in control for most of the past 73 years since the country won independence from British colonial rule. It began a celebrated shift toward democracy a decade ago but that process ended abruptly this week. The military has a history of violent crackdowns against pro-democracy demonstrators.</td>

The leaders of Chevron and  Exxon Mobil Corp.  discussed merging their companies last year, following the coronavirus outbreak that put them under tremendous financial strain. Such a deal would reshape the oil industry and reunite the two offshoots of John D. Rockefeller’s oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911. The talks were preliminary and aren’t ongoing, but could come back in the future. But a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. Chevron shares added 1.4% Monday.<br />Alphabet Inc.</td>

      <td>First, George Washington and Abe Lincoln get the boot as school names. Now academic achievement will soon be history. The progressive beat goes on in San Francisco, where the school board next week is expected to consider a resolution abolishing merit exams and high grade point averages for admission to Lowell High School.<br />Named for 19th-century poet and abolitionist James Russell Lowell, the school is a nationally known beacon of excellence. Lowell is also among the 44 schools whose names the school board recently voted to change because Lowell’s references to African-Americans are regarded as insufficiently enlightened by today’s standards.<br />One school board commissioner, Alison Collins, has called merit-based admissions “racist.” The real problem progressives have with Lowell is that too many Asian-Americans are passing the entrance exam. But it’s perverse to penalize Asian-Americans because other children do less well on tests.<br />That’s especially true in a public school system that does such a poor job teaching children of color at most of its schools. Last year the nonprofit Brightbeam put out a report called “The Secret Shame: How America’s Most Progressive Cities Betray Their Commitment to Educational Opportunity for All.” The report says that in San Francisco “70% of white students are proficient in math, compared to only 12% of black students reaching proficiency—a 58-point gap.”<br />The underperformance of black and Latino children in so many American public schools should be a national scandal. Instead, the response from elite universities and New York City’s high-performing public schools has been to disguise the problem by setting de facto admissions quotas for Asian-American students no matter their superior qualifications.</td>

The diplomats said they didn’t know the exact nature of what was found.<br />Last year, Iran blocked IAEA inspectors from checking the sites involved for seven months, leading to a standoff. Tehran has long denied that it has sought to make an atomic bomb and said all of its nuclear work is for peaceful purposes such as power generation and health care. There was no immediate comment from Iran on the findings.<br />In recent months, Iran has scaled up its nuclear activities, breaching many of the limits in the 2015 nuclear agreement it sealed with the U.S., European powers, Russia and China. These moves started over a year after the Trump administration exited the deal in May 2018 and then imposed broad sanctions on Iran, which had been lifted under the agreement.<br />It has also threatened to restrict IAEA inspectors’ access to sites later this month. These steps have caused growing concern in Washington about Iran’s nuclear intentions.</td>

      <td>White House touts polling data showing broad popularity for president’s plan as evidence that his agenda has bipartisan backing</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden, facing dim chances of winning many Republican votes in Congress for his Covid-19 relief package, is turning to a time-tested White House strategy: pitch the policy to voters of both parties instead.<br />The White House has been touting polling data showing that Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion proposal is broadly popular with Americans, including a Quinnipiac survey showing 68% support nationally. “This IS a bipartisan agenda,” chief of staff Ron Klain said on  Twitter .  Meanwhile, top White House aides have pitched the plan in hundreds of meetings with mayors, local elected officials, unions and business associations and participated in national and local television interviews.<br />Mr. Biden on Friday met with Democratic lawmakers, who had moved forward with a process that would allow them to pass a relief package with no Republican votes. The president later said in televised remarks that while he would like Republican support for his bill, he didn’t think GOP lawmakers were willing to do enough to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Some congressional Republicans balked at the White House pointing to national polls to call its plan bipartisan, as Democrats prepare to pass it along party lines.<br />“I think the idea that they’re claiming that as evidence of bipartisanship shows you how desperate they are for a fig leaf that they are doing something bipartisan,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy, (R., LA), who was among a group of 10 Republicans who met with Mr. Biden at the White House Monday.</td>

McNeil Jr., a star science and health reporter whose work on the coronavirus pandemic has been widely acclaimed, are leaving the Times, senior executives told staff on Friday.<br />The Times has faced criticism—both in its newsroom and on Twitter—that it isn’t applying its standards equally to all of its employees.<br />In a statement announcing his resignation, Mr. Mills said recent events, including the resurfacing of allegations regarding his behavior before his joining the Times in 2016, made the work atmosphere more difficult.<br />“The allegations on Twitter quickly escalated to the point where my actual shortcomings and past mistakes were replaced with gross exaggerations and baseless claims,” Mr. Mills wrote, noting that the online campaign had “grown to encompass some staffers of The Times.”</td>

      <td>Biden wants twice the spending of 2009, though the economy is far stronger now.</td>
      <td>Democratic economist Larry Summers and former GOP Senator and economist Phil Gramm don’t agree on much. But when they do, it’s probably worth paying attention. Now they’re both warning that President Biden’s $1.9 trillion spending plan may carry more risks than benefits.<br />Mr. Gramm made the case in our pages this week, and Mr. Summers in the Washington Post on Friday. Their economic vantage points are different, but they both suggest that the Biden bill’s focus on spending so much at the current moment to boost consumer demand is misplaced. The economic data increasingly backs them up.<br />That’s true despite Friday’s report that the economy added a disappointing 49,000 new jobs in January. The jobs report undershot expectations, but the details show that most of the damage to the labor market comes from state lockdowns and supply constraints. Payrolls were revised downward by a combined 159,000 for November and December as states shut down businesses.<br />Manufacturing employment declined by 10,000 in January amid shortages of components and workers. Some have hauled in office workers to run their assembly lines. Notably, the average work week for all private and manufacturing employees increased by 0.3 hours as businesses utilized their workers more.<br />Especially striking were the job losses in nursing homes (31,000), home-health care (13,100), transportation and warehousing (27,800), general merchandise stores (30,500) and online retail (14,800). Employers in these industries are desperate to hire, which Congress made harder by reinstating the $300 per week in enhanced jobless benefits through mid-March. Most low-income workers can make more unemployed.</td>

      <td>Republican support for big business craters in a new Gallup poll.</td>
      <td>Big business has helped Americans weather the pandemic. Retailers stayed open, tech firms made remote work possible, and the pharmaceutical industry is cranking out vaccines. So why did satisfaction with the “size and influence of major corporations” fall 15 points in this year's annual Gallup poll to a mere 26%?<br />The collapse came not among Democrats, whose skeptical views were virtually unchanged, but among Republicans. In 2020, 57% of Republicans said they were satisfied with big business. This year the number plummeted to 31%. The likely reason, as NBC’s Alex Seitz-Wald points out, is “the culture war reaching the C-suite.”<br />Put differently, many Fortune 500 firms took the Black Lives Matter protests as an opportunity to pivot hard to the left, ostentatiously endorsing protests even as they sometimes turned violent. Companies from  Amazon  to  Nike  donated large sums to progressive activist groups. Managers started to assign polarizing left-wing political texts to employees and adopted new racial hiring preferences. Brands like  Coca-Cola  and Eddie Bauer boycotted  Facebook  to try to pressure it to clamp down on political speech.<br />All of this did not pass without notice by Americans. Companies weren’t merely donating to their favored political candidates—they’ve done that for decades. They were bypassing the political process and intervening directly to transform highly contested parts of American life.<br />The firms believe this is good business, and affluent progressive consumers cheer the new political model. But everyone still gets one vote in elections, and the business community may be making a mistake by aggressively antagonizing the very Americans it has long relied on to protect it from government control.</td>

      <td>Republicans push education bills to give parents options.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration seems committed to indulging teachers unions that oppose charter and private schools. But the more important political action may be outside of Washington, as Republicans in more than a dozen states have responded to parental frustration with school closures by introducing legislation to expand education choice.<br />Last week the Iowa Senate passed a bill to provide students assigned to low-performing public schools with education savings accounts (ESAs), which are similar to vouchers but can also be used for textbooks, tutoring and more. Parents can roll over unused funds to future years.<br />The legislation would also allow charter schools that are independent of local school districts; today the state has only two charter schools. The bill increases a tuition-and-textbook tax credit from a maximum of $250 to $1,000 per student and extends the credit to home schoolers. “If there’s one thing the pandemic has taught us about education, it’s that our parents need choice. And it’s not just in-person versus virtual,” said Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds.<br />Florida Republican state Sen. Manny Diaz has introduced a bill to consolidate the state’s current scholarship programs into taxpayer-funded ESAs. Nearly 200,000 students participate in the state’s existing programs, only one of which uses ESAs. The ESAs would give parents more flexibility in how they use the money.<br />A GOP state Senator in Arizona is proposing to expand eligibility for the state’s ESAs—which are currently used by fewer than 10,000 students in a set of narrow categories—to low-income students across the state. Republicans in New Hampshire and Missouri are also moving ESA bills. Nebraska legislators are debating a new tax-credit scholarship program, and Republicans in Arizona are pushing to expand the aggregate cap for the state’s tax-credit scholarship program to $20 million from $5 million over three years.</td>

      <td>A scandal within Baltimore’s police culture revealed a cancer of criminal activity. Could it be rooted out?</td>
      <td>Toward the end of crime reporter Justin Fenton’s account of the catastrophic reign of a Baltimore police unit that became synonymous with law-enforcement corruption and brutality, BPD detective Ryan Guinn touches on a paradox many of his colleagues see at the heart of police work. Speaking of another officer’s brazen disregard for the law, Mr. Guinn protests: “He cut corners—yeah, what cop doesn’t cut corners? Show me a cop who goes A-to-Z and hits every letter in their investigation. With the pressure we’re put under to produce?”<br />The nexus between the “pressure” brought by civic leaders clamoring for an answer to gun violence, and the less lofty realities of the practical world of policing comes into focus in the story of one notorious team’s origins and descent into infamy, as told by a longtime journalist for the Baltimore Sun. Mr. Fenton’s “We Own This City” is the tale of the Gun Trace Task Force, founded in 2007 as a well-meaning initiative that would target the distributors and straw purchasers responsible for flooding Baltimore streets with guns. “We were like one big unit,” recalled Mr. Guinn, a founding member of the GTTF, “and we went everywhere.”<br />A few paragraphs into reading “We Own This City,” I had the distinct sensation that I’d read this story before. A quick search confirmed that sensation: The same events were the subject of “I Got A Monster,” by former Baltimore City Paper editor-in-chief Brandon Soderberg and freelance journalist Baynard Woods, published just seven months before Mr. Fenton’s. Both books chronicle the rise and fall of a Baltimore police unit so riddled with corruption that several of its members are currently serving long prison sentences after multiple trials that began in 2017. Both rely on many of the same kinds of sources: direct interviews by the writers, court documents, transcripts of federal wiretaps, and other public records. Both let the narrative unfold and the actions of its principals (mostly) speak for themselves. But where “I Got A Monster” preoccupied itself with telling a fast-paced story of policing gone bad, “We Own This City” takes its time, unspooling the history of the Gun Trace Task Force. Mr. Fenton is after more than the portrait of a few malcontents.<br />From its inception, the Task Force’s approach was supposed to be more measured and deliberate than the usual unsystematic approach to curbing violence, and for some time, it seemed to work: 268 guns were seized in the task force’s first year from just 41 arrests. Then a new commander changed the GTTF’s focus to more “street rips”—arrests of individuals suspected of possessing illegal firearms—and higher quotas, and the unit cut its personnel by more than half. And when BPD detective Wayne Jenkins moved into the unit, the possibility for graft and corruption increased by orders of magnitude.<br />Mr. Jenkins, as Mr. Fenton reports, was one of the more blatant examples of dirty cops firmly supported by the system. Complaints that he planted drugs, took money forfeited from drug seizures and committed physical assault led to civil lawsuits and criminal charges, but almost all resulted in acquittals. (One lawsuit did find Mr. Jenkins liable—for a single dollar.) “Nobody could tell him nothing,” said one cop. “He would not listen to anybody.” Mr. Jenkins was the one doing the telling, “like he would sit us down and have miniclasses, give us scenarios, see what we would do and show us how to do it and not get caught.”</td>

Regulations have supported this structure on the theory that small investors need to be protected from risk.<br />The challenge is that to protect one from risk also prevents one from gains. There are no such things as slam-dunk investments, and all bets can go down. To limit investors’ exposure to risk is to impede their ability to create wealth—something that should be easier than ever before given the market knowledge and access provided by modern technology.<br />Small investors made their voices heard, using the internet to force hedge funds into a short squeeze. Score one for the little guys. Is it a turning of the tides or a blip in the radar of the capital markets? That will depend on these increasingly empowered investors and how they continue to advocate for their interests in the public markets, message forums and everywhere in between.<br />Jason Frishman</td>

      <td>Where Gary Taubes gets it wrong is his lack of regard for the nutritional value of whole grains, fruits and vegetables.</td>
      <td>No arguing the merits of the keto diet, a successful approach for some to modify symptoms of obesity and other diseases (“What if Meat Is Our Healthiest Diet?,” Review, Jan. 30). Where Gary Taubes gets it wrong is his lack of regard for the nutritional value of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, lumping them in the same category of processed foods because they contain carbohydrates. Obesity and Type II diabetes became a national crisis over the last three decades, when we have seen an increase in obesity prevalence in all age groups, revealing that the cause isn’t singularly genetic in nature. Humans have survived and thrived on diets of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables (with or without red meat) for millennia without a high prevalence of obesity. Lifestyle, food preparation and the environment in which we live are primary culprits in the obesity crisis, not carbohydrates from whole foods. Current research tells us there is no magic bullet to treat obesity. To serve future generations who have not yet realized the challenges of obesity, research efforts need to focus on prevention of obesity, starting in early childhood when eating habits are established.<br />Andrea Bushaw, Ph.D., APRN, CPNP<br />Edina, Minn.<br />Mr. Taubes misses something important because he doesn’t consider what animal-protein diets look like in traditional societies around the world. In many traditional herding and pastoral societies that were or are dependent on animals for food—for example, among Dinka cattle herders or Sami reindeer herders—people rely more on milk and blood products than animal flesh, eating animal flesh only occasionally, usually on feast and celebration days.<br />Even in pastoral societies where primarily the flesh of the animal is eaten, meat is typically eaten much less often than in industrialized societies like ours, where it’s so easy to walk into a store and buy a steak or roast. People also make full use of every carcass in a way that most meat eaters in the U.S. do not, eating all organs, using the skin and boiling bones to make stock.</td>

      <td>Regarding the letters “Taiwan Defense: A Hard Problem for the U.S.” (Feb. 2) responding to Elbridge Colby’s “America Can Defend Taiwan” (op-ed, Jan. 27): Mr. Colby rightly argues that Taiwan’s defense is an obligation which should be explicitly recognized as such and that the U.S. can meet the challenge.<br />I would merely add that “a hard problem for the U.S.” would be much less hard if Taiwan could reliably outnumber any invading force, by adopting the Finnish model of universal (very) short-service conscription for (very) intensive training followed by placement in a ready reserve, with occasional refreshers. Unlike today’s forces whose major weapons and headquarters are highly vulnerable to missile attack, small units armed with man-portable missiles distributed throughout the island would survive to outnumber (by far) the maximum total of potential invaders. Finland with 5.5 million inhabitants can field 600,000 properly trained, properly armed defenders (total number on the books is 900,000). With 23.7 million inhabitants Taiwan should manage two million, i.e., twice the size of the entire People’s Liberation Army ground force and 10 times the size of the largest possible invading force.<br />Military service is very unpopular in Taiwan and it would be in Finland, too, if young Finns were forced to waste their time on parade-ground drills to sustain a conventional structure unlikely to survive one day of missile bombardment. As it is, young Finns look forward to their months of hard but highly purposeful training, rightly confident of defeating badly outnumbered invaders.<br />Edward N. Luttwak<br />Chevy Chase, Md.</td>

Their true roles were uncovered by the British counterintelligence agency, MI5, and they were sent home, according to the report and confirmed by the official. The media organizations aren’t being identified.<br />Wariness in Western countries about Chinese influence is growing beyond economics like trade imbalances and intellectual property protections. Increasingly, Western policy makers, including in the U.S., view China’s links to media, telecommunications and education as threatening to national security.<br />British officials say they have had to adjust in recent years to what they call a severe and growing espionage threat from China, which has long targeted commercial secrets but is increasingly seeking government information. They haven’t depicted the activity as aggressive as Russian espionage, which has been a British focus spanning decades.</td>

When hospitals visibly break down, constraints on political action, much of it ill-advised, will tend to disappear.<br />The second lesson concerns the vaccine. A miscalculation was the idea that, despite the emergency, adherence to existing testing protocols would encourage public confidence. This has now been disproved. Surveys and lengthy news investigations show that tens of millions, including many health-care workers, distrust a product developed at speed behind closed doors in double-blind clinical trials.<br />Early in the pandemic, outside experts urged so-called challenge trials, in which volunteers are deliberately exposed to the virus. An organization, 1 Day Sooner, signed up thousands of would-be participants. Rolling out the candidate vaccines as early as possible to willing volunteers, their fellow citizens and the media could have witnessed the results, which they can’t in double-blind studies where neither the subjects nor the administrator know who got the vaccine.<br />Not only would shots have gotten into millions of arms sooner. The risks of such an approach would have been merely substantial and the potential benefits off-the-charts, measured in trillions of dollars and thousands of lives saved.</td>

      <td>For decades, universities have taken advantage of graduates with humanities Ph.D.s and dim prospects.</td>
      <td>In an email to Artnet News last fall, Yale art professor Carol Armstrongexplained that her department’s “one-year suspension of admissions is directly tied to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and will have no further ramifications beyond that crisis.” That seems too optimistic. At least 140 graduate programs around the country have halted admissions, likely an acknowledgment of a half-century-old reality: Too many students working on advanced degrees have no hope of landing jobs in their chosen fields. The Covid crisis has merely made a bad situation worse.<br />The given reasons are generally similar. Several University of Chicago departments, including philosophy, music and comparative literature, announced that they won’t accept applications because they are “prioritizing supporting students who have already matriculated in the department.” Brown’s history department decided to focus its “energy and resources on supporting graduate students currently in the program” so “that they can be safe, healthy, and productive.” The University of Pennsylvania suspended all doctoral admissions to its School of Arts and Sciences to ensure current students have the resources to complete their work.<br />This “pause” should have happened decades ago. There are too many graduate programs in fields where there are no jobs. Take philosophy. During the 2018-19 hiring cycle, there were openings for about 180 junior jobs, roughly 70 postdocs, and about 60 spots open to those of any level of the profession, according to calculations by Gonzaga University’s Charles Lassiter. Meanwhile there were about 450 newly minted Ph.D.s in 2014 alone. The situation is similar in history, where the American Historical Association Career Center advertised 538 full-time positions for the 2018-19 school year. But 948 new history doctorates were awarded in 2018.<br />People who earn doctorates in the social sciences and the humanities have few job options outside academia. They can look for work in government, journalism or nonprofits, but they could have done that without spending six or eight years earning an advanced degree. Universities often cover the costs of these programs: They need graduate students to help teach undergraduates so that professors have time to publish studies no one reads. But the students can’t get back the years they lost working on a degree. And then there’s the effect of these degrees on lifetime savings. Someone who starts to invest for retirement at 25 could end up with twice as much as someone who starts at 35.<br />In the 1960s and ’70s, it was common for students to earn doctoral degrees in five years, working in junior academic positions while they finished dissertations. Now the median time to complete a doctorate in the arts and humanities is more than seven years, according to the Survey of Earned Doctorates, while more than half of those who enter doctoral programs never finish. That is a waste of young talent and energy.</td>

      <td>Cuomo blocks funding for a constitutionally required, bipartisan commission to draw fairer lines.</td>
      <td>Ed Koch must be turning in his grave. Less than a decade after the late former New York mayor’s successful crusade to create a fairer redistricting system for congressional and legislative districts, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state Democrats are busy subverting Koch’s work.<br />Business leaders and citizens concerned about New York’s socialist stampede need to pay attention. Robust political competition is good for the state and healthy for democracy. But if Democrats get their way on redistricting, New York will become a permanent one-party state, dooming its economic future.<br />Redistricting is a topic that has never captured the public’s attention, but every 10 years it commands the complete focus of Democratic and Republican politicians. Creating the “right” districts allows lawmakers essentially to select their voters, instead of the voters picking their legislators.<br />In New York, Koch changed all that by leading a coalition of good-government groups and newspaper editorial boards to shame and cajole Gov. Cuomo and lawmakers from both parties into placing a redistricting reform amendment before the voters in 2014. New Yorkers voted 57% to 42% in favor of establishing a bipartisan commission to create new districts, guided by standards limiting politicians’ ability to rig elections by drawing districts that favor those in power. The Legislature ultimately must pass a law enacting the new district lines, with only minor alterations allowed to plans developed by the commission. Courts are required to expedite consideration of any legal challenges to the commission’s work.<br />New constitutional standards require that districts respect existing jurisdictional boundaries and take care to recognize local communities of interest, including those representing racial and ethnic minorities. In a clear break with the past, the Koch reforms also required that minority parties in the state Senate and Assembly have a significant voice in this process.</td>

The diplomats who took part in the action have been declared “persona non grata” and were ordered to leave Russia in the near future, the statement said.<br />The move raises the stakes for the European Union’s support of Mr. Navalny, who has been increasingly portrayed in state television and by pro-Kremlin authorities as an agent of the West. Mr. Navalny was evacuated to Germany where he spent five months recovering after he was poisoned in the Russian region of Siberia last year.<br />A German military laboratory, as well as labs in France and Sweden said they found Novichok in his system, a military grade nerve agent accessible only to those in Russia’s military and intelligence circles.</td>

      <td>The bus dumped us in the sweltering Roman piazza before the church of San Pietro in Vincoli. Our destination: the famous statue of Moses. One befuddled visitor asked, “Is this the tomb of Moses?” From inside our earbuds, our unflappable tour guide intoned: “Ecco, the Tomb of Pope Julius II by Michelangelo Buonarroti, painter of the Sistine Ceiling.” Like twittering birds, our flock fluttered around taking pictures, many selfies.<br />Yet what we gazed upon is a far cry from the three-story ziggurat festooned with 40 marble statues that Michelangelo planned to carve himself and imagined as an eighth wonder of the world. The tomb, commissioned by Julius in 1505 for St. Peter’s Basilica and scarcely begun by the time of the pope’s death in 1513, proved to be Michelangelo’s 40-year albatross.<br />It was not completed until 1545, and then only after more than six contracts had been negotiated and innumerable design changes implemented, resulting in a smaller tomb, one set against a wall rather than freestanding. The figure of Moses, now the centerpiece, was originally intended as one of four prophets at the corners of the second story. A dozen years later, Michelangelo’s authorized biographer, Ascanio Condivi, would call the tomb “a tragedy.”<br />Yet the elapsed time also permitted the artist to mature and create a work that stands as a hinge point between the two Michelangelos, the youthful artist who astonished the world creating artistic marvels and the septuagenarian who yearned to be united in Christ.<br />The tomb is a two-story structure raised on a low plinth of undecorated marble, thus elevating and psychologically aggrandizing Moses. The richly decorated lower story with statues of Rachel and Leah acts as frame and foil for the prophet, while offering a dramatic contrast to the unexpectedly tall, and comparatively undecorated, upper story. There, Michelangelo created a bold and innovative architectural language that influenced such later designers as Gian Lorenzo Bernini.</td>

      <td>Federal labor authorities rejected  Amazon.com Inc.’s  request to delay a union election at one of its warehouses in Alabama, clearing the way for thousands of workers to begin casting their votes this month.<br />The National Labor Relations Board denied Amazon’s request Friday, saying the company didn’t raise any substantial issues warranting review of the election. The online shopping giant asked the board in late January to postpone the union vote scheduled to begin Monday at its facility in Bessemer, Ala. Amazon also asked authorities to reconsider allowing mail-in voting due to the pandemic. The workers have until late March to return their ballots in an election that could reshape Amazon’s relationship with its hourly employees.<br />An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was disappointed by the board’s decision. Amazon “proposed a safe on-site election process validated by Covid-19 experts that would have empowered our associates to vote on their way to, during and from their already scheduled shifts,” she said.<br />“It’s long past time that Amazon start respecting its own employees,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, which would represent the employees if they vote to unionize. Amazon must allow its workers “to cast their votes without intimidation and interference,” he said.<br />The union, which has become a frequent Amazon antagonist in recent years, has sought to garner support by rallying employees through family members and union members who work in other industries. Workers who want to unionize said doing so would let them bargain collectively over safety standards, training, breaks, pay and other workplace matters.</td>

      <td>WHAT IS IT with dog beds? Must they be those slobber-stained blobs that muck up an otherwise thoughtfully decorated interior? Luckily, a few designers, including Ellen Van Dusen, have pondered this as well. “Every bed was a shade of beige, and very utilitarian,” said the textile designer and founder of Brooklyn’s Dusen Dusen Home. “I didn’t get it—if you have all this nice furniture, why would you have this ugly pillow in the middle of the room?” Ms. Van Dusen has gone on to create color-blocked beds in vibrant shades, but pet lovers with more demure taste have stylish options, too—from flaxen chaise longues to rattan baskets that are plushed-out with fluffy cushions.<br />For safety’s sake, Gail Miller Bisher, the Fox Sports analyst for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, offered these tips: Avoid elevated beds for long-backed breeds like corgis or dachshunds, and steer clear of rippable fabrics if you have a teething puppy. Our picks reflect a universal truth: Cute is a mutable concept.<br />This roost brings you one dog bed closer to that dream of a Victorian-style, glass-enclosed room.

      <td>SoftBank Group Corp. -backed Greensill Capital, a specialty finance startup that helps companies manage cash, has delayed by several months plans to raise fresh money from outside investors, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Greensill had previously hoped to secure the investment by early January. But the company is unlikely to complete the funding round until late March at the earliest, some of the people said. One of these people said the delay is because Greensill has increased the amount it wants to raise to $1 billion from $500 million.<br />The fundraising delay comes at a challenging time for the company, which competes with banks to supply short-term capital to companies. The firm had anticipated extending $173 billion in financing last year, according to a presentation viewed by The Wall Street Journal, but ultimately provided $143 billion, flat from the year before.<br />Greensill has also run into issues doing business with other SoftBank-related companies. In December, Greensill forgave $435 million in financing to construction startup Katerra, in exchange for a roughly 5% stake in the company, Katerra’s chief executive told The Wall Street Journal.<br />Both companies are held in SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund. It isn’t clear how much the 5% stake in Katerra is worth. At the same time, SoftBank injected $200 million into Katerra to help it avoid bankruptcy.

      <td>Julien’s Auctions, in Culver City, Calif., bills itself as the Auction House to the Stars and specializes in celebrity items like Kurt Cobain’s guitar, which sold for $6 million last summer. But on Feb. 13, Julien’s will be auctioning some very different kinds of memorabilia. The items on sale in “The Cold War Relics Auction,” in person and online, include  a half-ton bust of Lenin and miniature cameras hidden in everything from belts to Marlboro cigarette packs.<br />These items come from the collection of the KGB Espionage Museum, which opened in Manhattan in early 2019. At the time, the museum claimed to have the world’s largest collection of objects associated with the Soviet secret police agency—more than 3,500, many from the personal collection of the museum’s founder, Lithuania-born Julius Urbaitis. The museum closed last March because of the pandemic and then shut down for good in October.<br />The USSR’s secret police agency was known by a series of names before it became the KGB in 1954—an acronym for its Russian name, Committee for State Security. From the beginning, it was adept at bugging things: Microphones went into wristwatches, wallets, ashtrays, belts, dinner plates and ballpoint pens, all of which are represented in the auction. The KGB even hid a side-facing camera inside a front-facing one, so the photographer could aim at one person while secretly photographing another.<br />Also on sale is a replica of the Great Seal of the U.S., given by a Soviet boy-scout organization to the American ambassador to Moscow in 1946 in gratitude for wartime aid. The gift was bugged; the Americans proudly hung it in the ambassador’s study, and it transmitted for years. A needle drill used to create the small holes for surveillance devices is expected to fetch $1,000-$2,000.<br />The auction’s catalog explains that language was a daunting challenge for the KGB, since the countries behind the Iron Curtain used many languages and two alphabets, Roman and Cyrillic. One solution was the Fialka cipher machine, which roughly resembles a typewriter and was used to code and decode messages. A far cry from today’s digital encryption, the machine operated with rotors—discs with electrical contacts that worked to encode the message. The Fialka is expected to fetch $8,000 to $12,000.</td>

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), an outspoken proponent of raising the wage, countered that the proposal would raise the wage over several years, not all at once, so he had no problem with the Republican amendment. As a result, it passed by unanimous voice vote.<br />“I will do everything that I can to make sure a $15-an-hour minimum wage is included in this reconciliation bill, but there appears to be some misunderstanding,” said Mr. Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats. “It was never my intention to raise the minimum wage immediately and during the pandemic.”<br />President Biden has called for a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, up from $7.25 currently, a move that would require action by Congress. But the wage wouldn’t jump the full amount immediately.</td>

The move will diminish Mrs. Greene’s ability to shape legislation and work with other lawmakers, sidelining her just weeks into her first term in office.<br />Still, Mrs. Greene said that she felt freed by the decision because Democrats held the power in Washington.<br />“If I was on a committee, I’d be wasting my time because my conservative values wouldn’t be heard and neither would my district’s,” she said.</td>

Pigments such as fire-engine red and neon green, which the experts view as invigorating at best and anxiety-inducing at worst. “As a rule of thumb, the more saturated and pigmented the color, the more it is associated with excitement and stimulation,” explained Palo Alto, Calif., architect Mary Maydan.<br />Here are the four specific paint colors that were most frequently cited by our expert panel, followed by four hues that designers generally agreed jangle the nerves.<br />Shades that call to mind sea and sky work on us like an aesthetic chill pill. “These colors connect us to the natural world, which does wonders for our stress levels,” said New York designer Ariel Okin, who singled out Borrowed Light.

The hue never reads yellow or pink, said New York designer Nate Berkus. “Alabaster is a chalky, warm, almost plaster-like white,” he said. “I like an environment that is a study in neutrals, which I’ve always found soothing and peaceful.” $80 a gallon, benjaminmoore.com</td>

Now I ask him to save my restaurant from the good intentions of progressive policy makers.<br />I own Pizza By Elizabeths, just outside Wilmington. The restaurant is named after the two Elizabeths—me and my former business partner, Betty—who founded it in 1993. It features an upscale-casual menu with vintage wines.

The president and his team may understand Delaware politics, but I’m not sure they understand the difficulties of Delaware restaurants. How else to explain his proposal to raise the minimum wage for our servers and bartenders from $2.23 an hour to $15—an increase of more than 400%—which would be a death knell for our industry?</td>

      <td>How a Census Bureau error led Democrats to assume they were on the right side of inexorable demographic trends.</td>
      <td>Remember the “coalition of the ascendant”? National Journal’s Ronald Brownstein invented the phrase in 2008 to describe the “growing elements of American society” that had elected Barack Obama and given Democrats commanding majorities in both congressional houses: “young people, Hispanics and other minorities, and white upper-middle-class professionals.”<br />Republican successes in 2010, 2014 and 2016 called the coalition’s durability into question. But the 2020 election—Joe Biden’s victory notwithstanding—may provide the greatest reason to doubt it. Compared with 2016, President Trump and congressional Republicans improved their standing significantly among Hispanic voters and made smaller strides among other groups, such as Asian-Americans, blacks and Muslims.<br />“The majority minority narrative is wrong,” says sociologist Richard Alba, referring to the idea that nonwhite Americans will outnumber whites by 2050 or so. In his recent book, “The Great Demographic Illusion,” Mr. Alba, 78, shows that many “nonwhites” are assimilating into an American mainstream, much as white ethnic groups did before them. Government statistics have failed to account for this complex reality, partly for political reasons, and in doing so they’ve encouraged sloppy thinking about the country’s future.<br />“The surge in mixing across ethno-racial lines is one of the most important and unheralded developments of our time,” says Mr. Alba, a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He rattles off facts and figures: Today, more than 10% of U.S.-born babies have one parent who is nonwhite or Hispanic and one who is white and not Hispanic. That proportion is larger than the number of babies born to two Asian parents and not far behind the number of babies born to two black parents. “We’re entering a new era of mixed backgrounds,” Mr. Alba says.<br />It reminds him of the postwar era, when the members of white ethnic groups began to make major socioeconomic gains as well as to intermarry. Mr. Alba, who grew up in the Parkchester neighborhood of the Bronx, is himself a product of this amalgamation: His father was Sicilian, and his mother was Irish. As for his politics, Mr. Alba describes himself as “a liberal with centrist leanings.” He voted for Mr. Biden and favors higher taxes and “more redistribution.”</td>

      <td>After ‘The Queen’s Gambit,’ TV could bet on a show about parcheesi—or dominoes.</td>
      <td>The enormously popular Netflix  series “The Queen’s Gambit” took 37 years to make it to the screen because Hollywood did not think the public would have much interest in a 1950s-era Kentucky orphan who grows up to be the world’s greatest chess player. It wasn’t so much the orphaned girl with the substance abuse problem that was the obstacle. It was chess. Too technical. Too nerdy. Too boring.<br />But by the time the pandemic arrived, the public was interested in watching—and playing—just about anything. So “The Queen’s Gambit” became one of the most popular Netflix series ever and spawned a revival of interest in the game, with chess sets flying off shelves around the world and new converts playing chess online at all hours. The verdict is still out on whether this is a good thing.<br />We don’t know if there will be a second season for the show, but since nothing succeeds like success, chess-themed spinoffs, sequels, prequels or out-and-out rip-offs are surely on the drawing board. A dirt-poor Las Vegas kid becomes a grandmistress and opens her own upscale consignment store, in “Pawn Shoppe.” Or perhaps a burger joint in the limited series “White Girl’s Castle.” Other possibilities? “The Rook’s Riposte.” “Knight of the Living Dead.” “Queen of the Hill.” “What Ever Happened to Joey’s Bishop?”<br />There is, however, no reason that future projects should be limited to chess. I, for one, would love to see a series about a down-at-the-heels pizza delivery man doing nothing with his life until he suddenly discovers a fascinating game of the same name as his employer. After a series of heart-rending missteps and disappointments, the young man triumphs in the game’s world championships, held in New York’s Little Italy. Proposed title? “The Domino’s Effect.”<br />A similar message about rising from humble beginnings and conquering adversity would be the theme of a series about a cash-strapped supermarket cashier who beats all comers in “Checkers for the Checker.” Which might spawn a British version called “The Draughts Dodger.” More possibilities wait in the wings: A lovelorn farmer’s wife falls in love with a charming, peripatetic card player in “The Bridge Players of Madison County.”</td>

      <td>When Kyndall Bennett lost her job as a multimedia designer in July, she took it as the push she needed to start freelancing.<br />“I had been considering doing it for a while, but the layoff kind of lit the fire underneath my behind,” says the 29-year-old, who lives with her husband Stevenn in Valley, Ala. “It was, ‘Hey, look. You might not think you’re ready for this but you’re just going to have to jump in and figure it out as you go.’ ”<br />She studied video tutorials on LinkedIn Learning about the ins and outs of what’s now often called “on-demand work” and booked her first freelance assignment in September. Since then, she has been offering multimedia-design services, such as video editing, and digital marketing on a contract basis. Though Ms. Bennett says the hustle required to freelance is challenging, she hopes to eventually make a career as an independent worker.<br />Ms. Bennett is one of thousands of people—from millennials to senior executives—who have started working for themselves in the pandemic, whether as high-skilled gig workers in fields like computer engineering, solo entrepreneurs launching one-person firms, or freelance workers offering specific services like data analytics or digital marketing.<br />Some are part of an undeclared economy—often one-person, cash operations not captured in the data. However, one measure points to a sharp rise in those turning to self-employment. Some who start a business of their own apply for tax identification numbers, and Census Bureau data show that applications by businesses not expected to have employees rose 33% in the fourth quarter of 2020 from a year earlier. In July though September, they jumped 77% from the previous three months—the largest quarter-to-quarter jump in 16 years of record-keeping.</td>

If successful, it would thrust the iPhone maker into the car business after several years of secretive work in which its engineers plotted to upend the 100-plus-year-old automotive industry.<br />The likelihood of a final agreement was thrown into question when Kia’s parent company,  Hyundai Motor Group ,  said last month, then sought to play down, that it was in negotiations with Apple to cooperate on an electric driverless car. Apple has never confirmed those talks, and its dalliances with other auto makers in the past have fizzled.<br />Hyundai has talked to Apple about investing more than $3 billion in a deal that would see its subsidiary Kia begin building cars under the tech company’s brand as soon as 2024, a person familiar with the matter said. Under such an agreement, up to 100,000 vehicles could be assembled in the first year in Georgia, where Kia has a factory, the person said. South Korean newspaper Dong-A Ilbo earlier reported the potential deal’s scope.<br />As reports of a deal have filled the Korean media, Hyundai and Kia shares have soared. Recently, Hyundai-Kia officials have been reaching out to potential partners in preparation for a deal going through. “We are hearing encouraging things,” said a person briefed on the matter in Georgia.</td>

      <td>Declines in retail and restaurant employment last month show a labor market still tightly in Covid-19’s grip</td>
      <td>The job market still hasn’t found its footing.<br />The Labor Department on Friday reported that the economy added a seasonally adjusted 49,000 jobs last month, which was in line with what economists expected, but it also revised the December and November figures down by a combined 159,000 jobs. The unemployment rate, which is based on a separate survey from the jobs figures, slipped to 6.3% from December’s 6.7%. But that came about in part because fewer people were looking for work and weren’t counted in the labor force as a result.<br />Two worrisome things about Friday’s report were that it showed that retailers shed a seasonally adjusted 37,800 jobs in January, and that restaurant and bar employment fell by 19,400 jobs.<br />Retail employment always falls in January from December, of course, as people hired on temporarily for the holiday shopping season are let go. But the Labor Department’s adjustments for seasonal swings should account for that effect. Moreover, because retailers hired fewer people during this past holiday season as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, many economists thought that the drop in retail employment would be smaller than the seasonal factors anticipated, so that the seasonally adjusted figure would actually rise.<br />Restaurant and bar employment fell even though measures such as the University of Oxford’s policy-stringency index suggest that, on balance, they didn’t face any greater restrictions on doing business in January than in December. That might be an indication that consumer caution, due to the surge in Covid cases that has only lately begun to subside, is taking a toll on business.</td>

      <td>The pediatrician and infectious-disease specialist is enthusiastic about the ‘phenomenal effectiveness’ of the shots that can prevent Covid-19</td>
      <td>Paul Offit was 5 when a clubfoot operation landed him in a Baltimore hospital ward for “crippled children” for six weeks in 1956. The atmosphere was “Dickensian,” he recalls: Some patients were in iron lungs, others were in traction, and most were hobbled by polio, a debilitating disease with a new but not yet widely available vaccine. His bed faced a window that overlooked the hospital’s front door, and he spent hours every day hoping for a visit from someone he loved. But a complicated pregnancy kept his mother away, and his father was banned after he tried to sneak in. The hospital allowed visitors only one hour a week, so the ward’s other children seemed similarly forlorn and helpless.<br />“It absolutely scarred me,” Dr. Offit, 69, says over the phone from his home in Avalon, N.J. The experience left him with an appreciation of the vulnerability of children and a deep desire to protect them. This, he says, is why he became a pediatrician, has written so many books about the medical needs of children and is such an outspoken advocate of the science and value of vaccinations. “I think the scars of our youth become the passions of our adulthood,” he says. “On some level, we always treat ourselves.”<br />An infectious-disease specialist, Dr. Offit is the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, a professor in pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee on vaccines. As a virology expert who co-invented a vaccine himself—his rotavirus vaccine saves up to 2,000 lives a day around the world—Dr. Offit has been helping the FDA to review the data for the latest coronavirus vaccines. He is enthusiastic about their “phenomenal effectiveness.”<br />The fact that researchers could prove the safety and efficacy of several vaccines within a year of sequencing the virus that causes Covid-19 has been a “scientific tour de force,” says Dr. Offit. The rollout, however, has been far from smooth, in part because the U.S. simply had “no plan” at the federal level for distributing the vaccine—an oversight that he attributes to the “denialism and magical thinking” of the Trump administration. Troublingly, nearly four in 10 Americans say they don’t plan to get vaccinated, according to a November survey by the Pew Research Center.<br />Some of this hesitation is understandable, says Dr. Offit. Not only was the vaccine developed in record time, but some of the language surrounding it—“Operation Warp Speed,” etc.—has been “a little frightening,” he concedes. But he notes that the clinical-trial data are “enormously reassuring,” and there is scant evidence of serious side effects in the millions who have already been vaccinated world-wide.</td>

      <td>A notorious defender of slavery was led to think seriously about how to protect minority rights.</td>
      <td>Gone are the days when someone could win a debate by claiming to be on the side of the Great Emancipator, Abraham Lincoln. The new rules for winning require accusing one’s opponent of being on the side of the Great Nullifier, John C. Calhoun, best remembered for his defense of slavery and his argument for the right of states to veto federal laws.<br />When the New York Times published “The 1619 Project” on the 400th anniversary of the first African slaves landing in Virginia, one of its essays labeled modern Republicans as Calhoun’s ideological successors. Not to be outdone, a report last month from the 1776 Commission, which Donald Trump formed as president partly in response to “The 1619 Project,” argued that Calhoun’s true heirs are the adherents of identity politics—that is, today’s Democrats.<br />Lost in such an exchange is the sort of serious analysis that Robert Elder, a history professor at Baylor University, provides in “Calhoun: American Heretic,” a timely and thought-provoking biography of the South Carolina statesman whose doctrines and debates set the stage for the Civil War. In the course of his chronicle, Mr. Elder traces how Calhoun’s thinking continues to influence American society today and shows how academic scholarship has moved ever closer to accepting Calhoun’s once shocking ideas about the role of slavery in American history.<br />Even many fellow Southerners recoiled upon first hearing Calhoun’s claim that slavery had created the surest conditions for equality among whites; slavery, he said, had produced an “unvarying level among them”—or, more precisely, above blacks forced to toil. “I fearlessly assert that the existing relation between the two races in the South . . . forms the most solid and durable foundation on which to rear free and stable political institutions,” Calhoun said in an 1837 Senate speech holding up slavery as a “positive good.”<br />A stunned Virginia senator responded that the first three slaveholding presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison—didn’t view slavery as the bedrock of the republic they had created. But, as Mr. Elder concedes, the argument is gaining ground. Indeed, it is now widely contended—not least among historians—that slavery “had to a significant degree underwritten the equality, prosperity, and progress of white Americans.”</td>

      <td>In his fictional mirror of Victorian England, Anthony Trollope created a world it would take a lifetime to fully explore.</td>
      <td>Fans of the Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) can take comfort in his inexhaustibility. My case is probably typical. I began reading him in my 20s, some 40 years ago, and have turned to him regularly, if in spurts, ever since. In a recent tallying-up I discovered I’d read 18 of his novels, or roughly one every two years. But there are 47 novels in all, leaving me with nearly 30 to go—some 60 years of Trollope to unfold. I find the image heartening: myself as an advanced centenarian, still with a few unread novels before me.<br />Trollope occupies a peculiar—a distorted—place in the American imagination. Fate has conspired, with the able assistance of the BBC, to portray him as a creator of landscapes so English that, under his spell, the rest of the planet falls under a distant haze. Trollope once remarked, “Visitors to England who have not sojourned at a country-house, whether it be the squire’s, parson’s, or farmer’s, have not seen the most English phase of the country.” Those country houses loom large in the BBC’s fetching Trollope adaptations, emerging in the 1970s with the vast 26-episode “The Pallisers,” continuing in the ’80s with the seven-episode “Barchester Chronicles” and extending into our century with “He Knew He Was Right” and “The Way We Live Now.”<br />Readers who first meet Trollope via television may be surprised to discover that in his time he was a footloose cosmopolite. Most of his early wanderings were business travel. Trollope worked for 33 years as a civil servant in the British post-office system, 20 of these years in Ireland, where the ghost of his disastrous childhood (“I was ill-dressed and dirty” and “despised by all my companions”) was successfully laid to rest. (“But from the day on which I set my foot in Ireland all these evils went away from me.”) He was later dispatched on post-office business to Egypt and Malta and Cuba. Still later, as a full-time author, he kept journeying abroad and wound up claiming five different continents as backdrops for his books: Europe, North America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. It would be hard to name another 19th-century European novelist whose work was so far-flung.<br />Trollope’s six Palliser novels are often regarded as the crowning summit of his ranging, mountainous output. They make up a loosely bound set. Conceived singly rather than collectively, they were published over 16 years, in the midst of other projects. What chiefly unifies them are their overlapping characters and their ongoing, clamorous obsession with parliamentary politics, especially the seesawing battle between Conservatives and Trollope’s own beloved Liberals. Pursuing a lifelong dream (“to sit in the British Parliament should be the highest object of ambition to every educated Englishman”), Trollope once stood unsuccessfully for the House of Commons, and the Palliser sextet might be viewed as a benevolent revenge upon an unobliging electorate.<br />The final—and to my eyes the finest—volume in the series, “The Duke’s Children,” has a curious publication history. In 1878, when he submitted the novel, Trollope was in a slough, commercially and critically, and his publisher convinced him to excise 65,000 words from the outsized manuscript. For more than a century, this was the “Duke’s Children” known to the world. But in 2015, on the occasion of Trollope’s bicentennial, the Folio Society published a deluxe limited edition of the restored text in England, and Everyman offered a hardcover in the States. The book, edited by the American scholar Steven Amarnick, now appears in paperback, as an Oxford World’s Classic (678 pages, $16.95). At long last, all the children of “The Duke’s Children” are fully born.</td>

      <td>GameStop and other companies briefly saw their share prices surge as Reddit-inspired buyers created a short squeeze. For executives, taking advantage of the situation is more complicated than it appears.</td>
      <td>Day traders have sent your company’s share price surging, seemingly without reason. What now?<br />That usually isn’t on the long list of things corporate executives have to worry about, and especially not at a company struggling to reinvent itself. Your share price is usually seen as a real-time vote of confidence in how you are doing and, when times are good, a currency for raising capital or buying a competitor—except when your company’s value rockets from $250 million a year ago to more than $25 billion in large part because of posts on a message board.<br />Shares of struggling retailer  GameStop  recently traded as high as $483 after closing at just below $19 last year and around $4 before the pandemic based on no real change in the company’s business prospects. The plunge has been just as stark as the climb: The stock closed below $54 on Thursday. Similarly volatile trading spilled over to shares of other businesses facing serious challenges like  AMC Entertainment Holdings ,   Express Inc.  and  Bed Bath and Beyond .<br />While the general public gawks at the price action, executives of the affected companies need to come up with a plan. They face some hard choices about whether to use an inflated stock price to raise more money for their company or even to boost their own wealth by cashing in stock options that are suddenly worth more. Those choices, as tempting as they may be, have real consequences.<br />Deciding whether to raise money is far more complicated than it might seem. The first instinct for holders of inflated stock is to sell it. That goes for companies just as much as individuals. After all, a high share price can have real business implications if there are people clamoring to buy it.</td>

      <td>A visit with four masters of short fiction is a lesson in artistry and vision.</td>
      <td>In recent decades, too many academic literary critics have used classic works of literature as mere springboards for social or political theories. When they do turn their attention to a work, they often treat it as a “text,” that is, as words on the page through which not the author but “language” speaks. George Saunders deems his delightful readings of seven stories by Chekhov, Gogol, Turgenev and Tolstoy non-academic, and they are all the better for that.<br />Mr. Saunders, himself a distinguished author of short stories, knows that the work is not the text but the experience the text is designed to create for the attentive reader. He guides us through each story to show what such attention can reveal.<br />To be certain that the reading experience is fresh when we consider his analyses, Mr. Saunders includes each story in full in an adequate, if not always the best, translation. He begins by giving us Chekhov’s “In the Cart” one page at a time, with his own commentaries following each page, so we can attend to how our feelings develop as we read—to the story not just as a remembered whole but as an unfolding event. How did Chekhov’s choice of words make us feel? What does an apparently superfluous description of nature accomplish, and why is it there? What were we anticipating at each point? Chekhov’s stories and plays often turn on a desired event that could have but did not happen—an expected marriage proposal never made, a neglected opportunity for kindness, a hoped-for meeting that could have eased unbearable loneliness. And so Mr. Saunders’s approach, which reminds us of that which we anticipated, works especially well. To understand short stories, we do not need some all-encompassing theory, he explains, but “moment-to-moment responsiveness.” To show why a given event or description is meaningful, Mr. Saunders sometimes rewrites a passage without it. The first half of Turgenev’s brilliant story “The Singers,” for instance, seems irrelevant to the plot about a singing competition, but Mr. Saunders retells the story without its beginning. The reader then grasps how the experience would be different, and understands why the author wrote the story he did.<br />At his best, Mr. Saunders teases out easily overlooked moments of authorial genius. The lonely schoolmistress of Chekhov’s “In the Cart” is distracting herself with thoughts about her school when, without preparation, she thinks how handsome the man who just passed by is. That thought, which intimates a romance she will never have, had evidently been occupying the periphery of her attention, even when she was concentrating on something else. “That self-interruption is a beautiful thing,” Mr. Saunders shrewdly observes. “It says: the mind can be two places at once. . . He’s not for her, she knows it . . . and yet her mind keeps being lured back to him.”<br />Readers have marveled at Tolstoy’s ability to make religious conversion psychologically plausible. Mr. Saunders notices one way Tolstoy does it. The hero of “Master and Man” does not first understand the divine truth and then act on it. Rather, he continues to act as he always has, but in circumstances that make formerly selfish behavior generous. With the same energy, the same words to himself, as he used in striking business deals, he now gives his life to save his freezing servant when they are both caught in a terrible snowstorm. He then, and only then—after experiencing surprising spiritual joy—realizes the truth and chooses to act on it deliberately.</td>

      <td>With interest rates so low, some advisers think investors have too much to lose by focusing solely on bond index funds</td>
      <td>Baby boomers investing for retirement back in the ’80s, ’90s and ’00s rarely had to worry about the bonds in their nest eggs.<br />Bonds back then mainly served as risk-reducing ballast for when stocks tanked. And they weren’t that much of a sacrifice because they often paid healthy interest yields of 5% or more.<br />But now, when boomers are supposed to have increased bond weightings in their portfolios—40% or more of a nest egg, according to the conventional wisdom—rates have fallen to the floor. Interest yields on a bond index fund are as low as 1.1%. As a result, retirees and other index bond investors are left staring at tiny interest coupons and a greater risk of rising rates, and thus of lost principal.<br />“With interest rates near their historic lows, so close to zero, there’s generally only one direction they can go,” says Steve Kane, a manager of the $90 billion  fund (MWTRX).<br />In response, investors might want to consider adding to their fixed-income portfolios some bond funds that can offer higher yields than U.S. bond index funds and offer varying degrees of protection from the risk of rising rates. At the moment, commonly used bond-market calculations suggest that for every percentage-point rise in rates, a U.S. bond index fund will lose about 6% in price, wiping out years of interest receipts.</td>

      <td>City’s government has used new powers to arrest dozens of opposition figures, eject pro-democracy lawmakers and stifle dissent</td>
      <td>Hong Kong has become a flashpoint in what some see as an emerging cold war between the U.S. and China. Exhibit A is Beijing’s decision to bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and impose new national-security legislation on the city on July 1 to stamp out a yearlong protest movement.<br />Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed government moved quickly to make use of those powers to pacify the city, arresting protesters, ejecting four pro-democracy lawmakers from the city’s legislature and rounding up opposition figures. Recently, 53 were arrested in a series of dawn raids on Jan. 6 over allegations of plotting to subvert the city’s government, taking the total of security law arrests to around 100 as of early February.<br />The U.S. has taken steps to punish Beijing by restricting visas for Chinese officials and declaring that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to merit special treatment on trade in goods such as defense technologies. It also imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials and Hong Kong governing figures including Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Here’s how we got to this point.<br />Around 1,000 police officers arrested 53 pro-democracy figures in a high-profile operation that involved searching 72 locations across the city on Jan. 6. It was the biggest swoop since the law was imposed.<br />The allegations center on unofficial primaries held by opposition groups in July for the public to choose the most popular candidates for legislative elections planned for September. More than 600,000 people voted. The pro-democracy camp sought to win more than half of the 70 seats in the city’s legislature and said it would use a majority to block government policy. Many candidates were subsequently disqualified, and officials then postponed the poll for a year, citing the coronavirus situation.</td>

      <td>No single trick delivers the crisp skin and juicy meat we covet. An experienced roaster shares her own, holistic approach, and a recipe so simple and reliable you’ll want to use it weekly.</td>
      <td>I FIELD more questions than you might imagine on the best way to roast a chicken. It comes up all the time among friends who know I used to cook at Zuni Café in San Francisco, legendary for its version.<br />The secret to the Zuni chicken is that there really isn’t one. The recipe relies on no special bells or whistles. You don’t need to apply a hair dryer to ensure a crispy skin, as a viral recipe from 2018 recommended. It’s more about understanding a few fundamentals than adhering to any one trick or recipe.<br />Roasting a whole chicken has always been a staple of the weekly cooking in my household, mostly because it’s economical, yielding returns throughout the week. The legs often get eaten first, accompanied by bitter greens or mushrooms cooked in the chicken fat. Breast meat frequently gets stewed down in beer or stock as a filling for tacos, topped off with skin crisped into chicharrón. The carcass becomes stock, which I like to use in a comforting rice porridge.<br />My husband and I have maintained our weekly roast-chicken ritual during the pandemic, and we’ve experimented, too—sometimes unintentionally. There were times we simply forgot what was on the evening’s menu or had a hunger for something else, which meant we left the salted chicken uncovered in the refrigerator, dry brining, up to 3 days. The result: a shatteringly crisp skin once we got around to roasting. Other times, a pantry sweep turned up different spices—sumac, say, or cayenne—to bolster the dry brine.<br />In my Zuni days, I learned a lot from the restaurant’s massive wood-fired oven. It has two chambers. “The rear gap allows flame to travel from the bottom chamber into the upper,” Zuni’s current chef de cuisine, Nate Norris, confirmed. This creates hot spots, so a cook must move the chicken around as it roasts. While there’s really no way to replicate that oven at home, you can get close enough by cooking at a high temperature and cranking it up even higher in the final stage.</td>

      <td>Working as a bodyguard with a half-troll and some other odd characters sounds risky. But even a witch has bills to pay.</td>
      <td>As we know from Terry Pratchett—and before him from Shakespeare—wizards and witches are very different. Wizards are old gentlemen, like Prospero in “The Tempest,” who practice magic out of books. Witches, on the other hand, commune with nature in country cottages (if not the blasted heath of “Macbeth”) and are good with potions.<br />Dellaria Wells, the heroine of C.M. Waggoner’s “The Ruthless Lady’s Guide to Wizardry” (Ace, 371 pages, $17), challenges both stereotypes. “Delly” is an urban gutterwitch, and she’ll have a curse on her if she can’t pay the rent on her squalid apartment—it’ll be weeping pustules, warns her landlady, mostly on the face. But she had the luck to do a year as a scholarship kid at Weltsir University, where her education in magic turned her into the best fire witch in the business. She can melt metal with a thought, which is useful when dealing with assassin spider-robots or animated suits of armor.<br />Delly aims to fix her financial problems, and rescue her addict mother, by taking a job as a bodyguard to an aristocratic young woman entering the traditional period of seclusion before marriage. Her colleagues at her new gig are Winn, who’s part-troll; Mrs. Totham, a “body scientist” (polite language for necromancer); and Mrs. Totham’s daughter Ermintrude, a “cloved woman” (seemingly, a were-pig). This disjointed group must learn to work together to protect their charge. But all their efforts fail, for there is big money involved in the marriage, and the job turns into a quest for revenge and restitution.<br />Much of the comedy in Ms. Waggoner’s story comes from the clash between Delly’s Dickensian world, where “red drip” takes the place of cheap gin, and the Jane Austen realm of arranged marriages, footmen and careful distinctions between ladies and “lady-adjacent personages.” For Delly, it’s all a graduate course in wizardry, as well as a blossoming relationship with Winn, who, it turns out, is pretty big in troll-society and moreover talks old-fashioned, understated British English. (“Steady on . . . Not really the blinking sort of thing, is it?”)<br />As always in fantasy, there’s great fun in figuring out the rules of the game. In this world, spells and magical assaults are powered by animal-sacrifice, but the animals sometimes come back to life, like Buttons the not-quite-zombie mouse. Delly is an engaging heroine, at once magically aggressive and socially uncertain, and she leads us into a milieu both strange and, in a literary way, familiar. It would be good to hear more of it another time.</td>

      <td>A tale of surrender, survival and fate from Melanie Finn.</td>
      <td>‘Men mistake the act of submission for the condition of submission. But they don’t know that women split themselves right down the middle,” Melanie Finn writes in “The Hare” (Two Dollar Radio, 320 pages, $16.99), and the same division that separates appearance from meaning cuts across this involving, morally complex novel. Its heroine is Rosie Monroe, who grows up amid poverty and abuse in a Lowell, Mass., boarding house until moving to New York with a full scholarship to art college. There she meets Bennett Kinney—older, sophisticated and mysterious, radiating an aura of wealth and privilege. Bennett’s secrecy can seem solicitous, as though meant to protect Rosie from their class differences. But it’s also sinister: In the opening scene he hits something—someone?—on a dark highway and refuses to stop. Rosie chooses his placating story that nothing happened over her own lying eyes.<br />Rosie becomes pregnant just as Bennett’s prevarications grow more desperate and transparent, and soon he’s hustling her out of a beachfront vacation house for an unheated cabin in northern Vermont, apparently fleeing the police. As violence intrudes, the novel takes a familiar shape. Rosie’s and her daughter’s survival depend on her learning to fend for herself and getting free from Bennett’s control.<br />If that were the totality of “The Hare,” it would be an effective but boilerplate story of feminist redemption. Instead, its second half leaps ahead 26 years to 2019, when Rosie is a 54-year-old bookkeeper barely making ends meet in the same weather-beaten Vermont cabin. Partly provoked by the inquiries of Rosie’s daughter, who isn’t satisfied with the sketchy explanations of what happened to her father, the past resurfaces in threatening, complicated forms. Time has made Rosie’s attempts to reclaim the narrative of her life resemble Bennett-style deceptions. What seemed brave and righteous from one angle looks, from another, like complicity with his evils. Is she a victim or an empowered free agent? Necessity and choice are present in all of her actions, opposed but complementary like the two sides of a coin.<br />Which is to say that the drama in “The Hare” is between free will and the “steady and ancient gait” of fate. In a brief aside about her book club, Rosie reflects that she reads because she likes to feel “muddled,” whereas “the others in the group wanted to feel certain.” Ms. Finn is a sensitive observer of Rosie’s circumstances and the depictions of poverty, in particular, are real and omnipresent, yet they’re never essentializing. Rosie is a difficult character, full of anger, generosity and self-doubt, and her muddle is the stuff of true tragedy.<br />The fabulists in Vendela Vida’s “We Run the Tides” (Ecco, 254 pages, $26.99) are 13-year-old girls who are imitating womanhood before they actually arrive there. The setting is Sea Cliff in San Francisco, the name given to the beachside neighborhood overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge that today is the exclusive habitat of tech billionaires but in the mid-1980s, when the novel takes place, comprised a more mixed population. Eulabee, the novel’s narrator, comes from a family of working-class Hungarian and Swedish immigrants, but her gossipy community and the haughty traditions of her private all-girls school have taught her that, like sexual maturity, class pretension is something that has to be faked into reality.</td>

      <td>Alvin York’s feats on the battlefield were obscured by movies and mythology, but his heroism under fire was the real thing.</td>
      <td>The saga of Alvin York is embedded in the golden age of U.S. military history—the two great wars of the 20th century, long before the endless ambiguous conflicts on the far borders of the American imperium. A red-haired, freckle-faced hillbilly from Tennessee, the acting corporal was credited with almost singlehandedly capturing 132 German soldiers and officers and killing 25 others in a spasm of sharpshooting heroism unmatched to this day. His gallantry on Oct. 8, 1918, helped save the beleaguered “Lost Battalion” and marked a turning point in the Great War that ended barely a month later.<br />Today, only the oldest Americans have any sense of World War I, though a few film buffs may know of its greatest hero through the corn-pone classic “Sergeant York” (1941), in which a drawly 40-year-old Gary Cooper played the 30-year-old doughboy. Fading memory mists the unparalleled butchery on the Western Front as Allied troops and the hated Boche went “over the top” from their trenches and fox holes to face annihilating machine-gun fire, exploding shrapnel shells and, in the Allies’ case, searing poison gas.<br />Besides the movie, there are at least a dozen books about York (including two bestselling ghosted autobiographies) and a state historical site where his farmstead and mill stood in tiny Pall Mall in the northern Tennessee hill country. Now military historian James Carl Nelson has turned out an exhaustively researched but mercifully compact study called “The York Patrol.” A conscientious work, it’s at once an overwritten and underwritten addition to the York bookshelf.<br />As the legend is told, York was a kind of rustic Prince Hal, but of sturdy American peasant stock rather than Plantagenet blood. He grew up, Mr. Nelson relates, hunting fox, turkey and varmints with his father. Young Alvin had barely a year of schooling spread over five years, didn’t have a pair of shoes until he was 16, when he stood 6 feet and weighed 160 pounds, and didn’t crack a book until he was 20. He turned into a carouser who could down a quart of moonshine by himself or with his pals in ramshackle saloons with the Kentucky-Tennessee border painted on the floor (because it was legal to drink only in Kentucky).<br />But before York surrendered to Satan, a barnstorming evangelist brought him to Jesus. He quit drinking, smoking, cursing and fighting and became a young elder in the Church of Christ in Christian Union. Then, in 1917, President Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany and its ally, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</td>

      <td>What does it mean that we spend so much time staring at our phones, not-quite connecting with others? How does our relentless, rat-pellet pursuit of likes, amusement and “information” change how we think, read, communicate and see ourselves in the world? These are important, urgent questions, but they pose serious problems for novelists, in part because the dramas that take place while we’re staring or tapping at a screen are hard to dramatize.<br />But in the third decade of this new century, writers who came of age online are starting to marry insight with their experiences. One of the most incisive observers of the spectacle of digital discourse is Patricia Lockwood, 38, the anointed “poet laureate of Twitter.”<br />For Ms. Lockwood, who grew up in a cloistered, Catholic home with parents who couldn’t afford to send her to college (an experience she describes colorfully in her acclaimed 2017 memoir, “Priestdaddy”), the internet offered both an education and salvation. She found solace in the online companionship of other autodidact weirdos, met her husband on a poetry chatroom and married at 21—the surest way out of any house that also happens to be a rectory (her father is indeed a priest, owing to a loophole in Catholic doctrine that allows married ministers of other faiths to convert).<br />As an aspiring poet, she developed a following on Twitter for her absurd, playful and often sexually explicit tweets, which danced the fuzzy line between poetry and webspeak (“I am a water glass at the Inquisition. You are a dry pope mouth. You pucker; I wet you”). Then in 2013 her poem “Rape Joke” became a viral sensation for its startling mix of darkness and humor in a millennial patois. (“The rape joke is that he was your boyfriend. / The rape joke it wore a goatee. A goatee.”) By using the stutters and ironies of contemporary chatter to write about things like sex, trauma and social norms in verse, Ms. Lockwood’s poems often feel accessible and relevant.<br />Now a convention-flouting critic and essayist with two books of poetry, Ms. Lockwood has a clear appreciation of what it means to be both of the internet and a witness to it. This tension—between the winking cynicism of social media and the seriousness of poetry; the alluring groupthink of online writing and the need to step outside it—is the main subject of her impressive debut novel, “No One Is Talking About This.”</td>

      <td>Selected by the author, most recently, of ‘This Is the Voice.’</td>
      <td>By Christopher Isherwood (1976)<br />1. When Christopher Isherwood moved to Berlin in 1929, it was because “Berlin meant Boys”—and this memoir, first published almost five decades later, became a classic of gay liberation. But the book also offers chilling warnings about tyranny’s invidiously bland rise. At first dismissing the Nazis as simply part of the “seething brew of history,” Isherwood and his friends change their view when Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor. Boy bars are raided; three homosexual Englishmen working as teachers are arrested. Soon Isherwood’s pal, Edward Upward, is writing from England: “Don’t get killed before I come.” Unfortunately, the book also displays all the weaknesses of rewritten diaries. We learn way too much about Isherwood’s vacation jaunts, especially when a tale of gripping awfulness is occurring in the margins, like his efforts to elude the Gestapo and smuggle his lover, Heinz, out of Germany—a nightmarish episode that makes the limp travelogues (“I love Portugal. The people are charming”) at once ludicrous and morally obtuse.<br />By Vladimir Nabokov (1947)<br />2. Vladimir Nabokov loved to insist that his fiction had no autobiographical angle, but “Bend Sinister,” his first novel written in America, is a kind of horrified imagining of what might have befallen him, his wife, Vera (a Jew), and their 7-year-old son had they not escaped in 1940 on one of the last boats out of France. The philosopher Adam Krug, living in a fictional police state governed by the “Party of the Average Man,” refuses to pledge loyalty to a regime that has reduced science, art, history, poetry and museums to “one long hoax.” Adam’s 8-year-old son David is consequently seized and held, to be traded for Adam’s party endorsement. Adam is about to comply when the bureaucratic ineptitude that Nabokov always recognized as a hallmark of tyranny hideously asserts itself: a slight snafu in the child-separation scheme. The book is written in disjointed, Kafka-esque prose that betrays the depth of Nabokov’s emotional investment in the material—an investment he was, as the high priest of Art for Art’s Sake, always at pains to disavow.<br />By Josef Škvorecký (1969)</td>

      <td>The birds and the beasts take their turn at the carnival after dark.</td>
      <td>In Peggy Rathmann’s beloved 1994 picture book, “Good Night, Gorilla,” a zookeeper closes up for the night unaware that the animals he thinks he has secured in their cages are tiptoeing behind him in order to follow him home. Gideon Sterer’s picture book “The Midnight Fair” (Candlewick, 32 pages, $16.99) tells a different story, but with its glowing colors, secretive animals and air of mischief it partakes of similar delights.<br />In Mariachiara Di Giorgio’s beautiful and atmospheric paintings, wild creatures watch a grassy fairground from a safe distance as carnies set up tents, rides and food stands. That night, the animals wait until the human visitors have streamed away. One last fellow whistles as he locks up and drives off, leaving the fair’s delights unguarded. The raccoons have no trouble exploiting a gap in the chain-link fence, and soon beasts of all sizes are gamboling and reveling: lining up for cotton candy, whirling on the teacup ride and playing games to win goldfish in plastic bags. As the night goes on, the illustrations take on the delirious, slightly queasy-making quality of a real night at the fair. Lights blur, faces slacken, everything seems to spin. At dawn, the custodian returns, only belatedly noticing evidence of trespass. The animals, meanwhile, have slipped back into the woods, where some will sleep, some will continue their revels and one, a gray wolf, will perform a quiet act of charity. Wordless and eloquent, “The Midnight Fair” offers true enchantment for children ages 3 to 8.<br />In Steve Light’s buoyant picture book “Road Trip!” (Candlewick, 40 pages, $16.99), four animal friends from a place called Whiskers Hollow spend an eventful day hunting for a new headlight for Bear’s old red truck. The charm of Whiskers Hollow lies in its cockamamie proportions and intricate details: The road of the title runs along tree limbs, and Bear and his truck (and his friends ) are smaller than acorns. Whiskers Hollow itself is full of stumps that have been hollowed out to make shops and dwellings. There are shades here of Richard Scarry’s industrious animal tableaux and of the cozy treehouses in Jill Barklem’s Brambly Hedge books, though Mr. Light’s style is looser and less cuddly, with shaggier lines and more abundant use of both white space and black ink. “Road Trip!” establishes the personalities of earnest Bear, cautious Mouse, hungry Rabbit and adventurous Donkey, all of whom children ages 3-8 will be glad to see again in future Whisker Hollow adventures.<br />A foster child racked by episodes of unexplained pain finds himself dispatched from the hospital and sent to live in a mysterious compound in “The Ash House” (Chicken House, 336 pages, $17.99), a novel by Angharad Walker for braver readers ages 10 and older. Inside the gates of the place, the boy meets unnerving cohorts of boys and girls who are named for qualities known as “Nicenesses.” A boy called Freedom introduces the newcomer (who is given the name Solitude, or Sol for short) to the peculiar daily practices of life at the Ash House estate. Without their adored Headmaster, who has been gone for years, the children keep order among themselves. They sit for recorded lessons in Niceness and carry out their chores beneath skies patrolled by drones.<br />None of the children seems aware of the outside world, and Sol himself soon can’t remember his real name. He does, however, retain an urgent sense that there’s something sick and wrong about the Ash House. This impels him to probe its secrets but also makes him an object of suspicion, and in a terrifying scene involving an open grave and a dead pig, Sol’s companions inflict on him a ghastly form of discipline. When a man known as the Doctor arrives, Sol is so fixated on his hope of being healed that he fails to notice the other children’s abject terror. The book has an allegorical chill that settles slowly, like damp seeping in, making certain revelations near the end all the more shocking. Ms. Walker doesn’t explain everything about Ash House and its inmates, though, leaving readers with a feeling of ambiguous unease that may stir for a long time in the back of their minds like the after-effects of a nightmare.</td>

      <td>Chic, virtually indestructible, much more practical than you’d think—vintage wool rugs are interior designers’ go-to bathroom rugs</td>
      <td>“BATHROOMS ARE inherently cold spaces,” said Meg McSherry, a designer in Newton, Mass. “We’re always focused on ways to add warmth.” One seemingly counterintuitive way to cozy up a loo stylishly? Vintage wool rugs, say many design pros, including Ms. McSherry. While cotton is the default choice, wool is “naturally strong, soft underfoot and not stubborn with stain removal,” she said.<br />A vintage Persian rug is no more likely to grow moldy than many other natural materials. Cotton, for example, mildews at lower humidity than wool, according to the Smithsonian’s Museum Conservation Institute. But if you can’t get your mind around sopping a wool rug post-bath, top it with a small cotton mat you hang over the tub or towel rod to dry between ablutions. If you want additional cushiness, place your wool rug atop a nonslip, recycled felt pad, said Chicago designer Elizabeth Stamos.<br />Another perk of opting for a weathered carpet? “Vintage rugs are perfectly imperfect,” Ms. McSherry said. “They will [already] have some wear and tear, so any makeup spills will not be super noticeable.” Going vintage also offers the same satisfaction as choosing to reuse anything: less land-fill fodder. “And it feels less precious than buying new, meaning you probably won’t feel bad about getting it wet,” said Kerra Michele Huerta, a designer in Washington, D.C.<br />You’ll need to vacuum a vintage rug weekly at least. A study out of Ohio State University last year found that a dusty rug will hold more moisture than a clean one. Vacuum the piece on a low-power setting if your machine has one. “Clean up spills immediately, blotting the stain and using lukewarm water with mild detergent,” advised Salt Lake City designer Sarah Gibson, who also writes a blog called Room for Tuesday, on which she has advocated for wool rugs in the bathroom. “Wool is naturally a moisture-wicking material,” said Ms. Gibson, who grew up raising sheep on a farm and admits to being a wool zealot. You can also give your rug a do-it-yourself deep clean, hand washing and drying it flat, as you would a wool sweater.<br />Vintage rugs also offer more versatility than a typical rug designed for a bathroom. You most likely wouldn’t move a chenille number to your bedroom or entryway, but a vintage rug travels well. They’re also great-looking and one-of-a-kind, and they can be found at auction for a song.

      <td>Private-jet travel is booming amid travel restrictions and flight groundings for commercial airlines</td>
      <td>Bill Gates is doubling down on private-jet travel, as the niche industry recovers more quickly amid the coronavirus pandemic than the wider commercial aviation market.<br />The billionaire’s Cascade Investment LLC agreed Friday to team up with  Blackstone Group Inc.  and private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners in a $4.7 billion deal for  Signature Aviation  PLC. The deal would boost Cascade’s stake in the world’s largest operator of private-jet bases to 30%, from a previous 19%.<br />Commercial flying in much of the world has fallen sharply amid travel restrictions, quarantine rules and steep reductions in flights operated by cash-strapped airlines. Private-jet travel has bounced back quicker. For individuals and companies who can afford it, a private jet offers a way to limit close-quarters exposure to other passengers, as well as providing service to destinations that have been abandoned by airlines.<br />U.K.-based Signature Aviation said in November that demand had stabilized at 80% of 2019 levels. In comparison, global commercial airlines were operating at around one-third of pre-pandemic capacity then.<br />The move comes after more than a year of jostling between the three firms, drawn by the relatively quick recovery in demand for private jets. Blackstone and GIP had previously been engaged in a bidding war for the company.</td>

      <td>Researchers warn that the variant, now detected in the U.S., may spread faster and could reduce the efficacy of vaccines</td>
      <td>A more contagious strain of the coronavirus, first discovered in South Africa, has now been detected in the U.S. The variant has raised concerns over how it will respond to Covid-19 vaccines and whether people who already had the disease could get it again from the new strain.<br />It is normal for viruses to mutate, and most mutations observed so far in the coronavirus sweeping the globe have made little difference to how it functions. The South African variant, known as B. 1.351 or 501.V2, has worried scientists because of its unusually large number of mutations, especially in the spike protein, which the virus uses to attach to and infect human cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus targeted by Covid-19 vaccines and antibody treatments.<br />The discovery and spread of the variant in South Africa coincided with a powerful surge in infections in the country. South African researchers say they believe that the new variant is around 50% more contagious, based on the much faster rate of Covid-19 transmission since its emergence and biological studies of changes to the structure of the virus, which appear to make it easier for it to attach to and infect human cells. The new strain quickly crowded out other versions of the virus circulating in the country. Still, they say human behavior also contributed to the rise in infections. The researchers say that the new variant doesn’t appear to lead to more severe cases of Covid-19.<br />Health authorities in South Carolina and Maryland have identified people who were infected with the South African variant. At least some of those people haven’t traveled abroad recently, suggesting that the variant is potentially circulating in the community. The variant has also been detected in people with no recent travel history in the Canada, Israel, and several countries in Europe and Africa.<br />The scientists who sequenced the South African variant’s genome say it has a mutation—known as N501—that it shares with a separate variant discovered in the U.K. Scientists say that mutation is likely responsible for making the variants more transmissible.</td>

      <td>U.S. employers added 49,000 jobs last month, returning growth to the labor market after a one month dip, while the unemployment rate fell to 6.3%.<br />The small January gain came after payrolls fell steeply in December, the first decline since the coronavirus pandemic triggered business shutdowns last spring.<br />Jobs grew strongly in business and professional services, the Labor Department said in its January report on U.S. employment. Many sectors, though, lost jobs last month. The leisure and hospitality sector lost 61,000 jobs in January, following a steep decline of 536,000 in December. Retailers, health-care companies and warehouses cut jobs in January.<br />The fall in the unemployment rate in part reflected the Labor Department’s annual update to population estimates used to calculate the unemployment rate and other measures. The new estimates show the civilian labor force was 200,000 lower than previously estimated, employment was 180,000 less, and unemployment 20,000 less.<br />The broader economic recovery stalled significantly this winter. Unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, have remained above pre-pandemic levels. Consumers cut back on spending, as some were wary of leaving their homes as virus cases surged.

      <td>Pared-back collections of clothes and accessories are simplifying women’s lives and eliminating daily ‘what to wear?’ stress. Here, how to build your own.</td>
      <td>IF YOU’VE GOT a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear, consider the benefits of a capsule wardrobe. Worn in combos, these tightly edited, pragmatic assortments of clothes and accessories can create many fail-safe outfits. The strategy can liberate you from the oppression of wondering “What should I wear,” simplify life and free your mind to engage in more meaningful pursuits, such as rereading “To the Lighthouse” or taking that raku pottery workshop.<br />Factors from Covid-19’s confinement lifestyle to Marie-Kondo culture have all fed the popularity of capsule wardrobes over the past year. Aren’t we all on a quest for control? But the capsule wardrobe concept has been around for decades. The term even merits its own relatively concise Wikipedia page, which credits the invention to Susie Faux who, in the 1970s, founded a London boutique called Wardrobe. Donna Karan’s mid-80s version, Seven Easy Pieces, changed the game for “Working Girl”-era women. And women’s magazines have trafficked in variations on “Five Ways to Wear It” or “10 Wardrobe Staples” for years.<br />For some modern-day apostles, it’s about putting your closet on a fashion diet. You can approach this by adhering to a preferred color palette or eliminating all but go-to basics—but rules help. Back in 2010, Courtney Carver, a 51-year-old in Salt Lake City, Utah, created Project 333, a 3-month challenge that required her to refrain from shopping and whittle her wardrobe to 33 items (underwear, sleepwear and workout gear don’t count). The process was part of a life-simplifying journey that began when Ms. Carver was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Once a self-described “adder,” she used to shop weekly to boost her mood. “It was ‘If I get this thing, I’ll feel happier,” she said. “It was never about the item. It was escape.”<br />Lee Vosburgh, 33, a blogger who runs the website Style Bee, created the 10 x 10 Challenge in 2015 as an antidote to her own shopaholism. Her call-to-action: Restrict yourself to 10 items, and style them into 10 outfits over 10 days. For her part, Jennifer Alfano, 52, a former Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar editor who now runs TheFlairIndex.com, doesn’t adhere to any magic-number methodology. She advocates eliminating excess by making “a list of what you have, why you have it and why you should keep it.” Next, reduce your closet to “an ultimate packing list” to identify essentials. Early last year, Ms. Alfano undertook an epic purge, parting with 281 items including her Hermès Birkin bag, which had sat unused for years. Among the keepers: an Yves Saint Laurent pea coat, Céline by Phoebe Philo sweaters and Manolo Blahnik shoes. She suggests selling your castoffs on sites like TheRealReal or recycling them through the service TerraCycle.<br />Over a 30-year career in fashion, which included executive posts at Lane Crawford and Net-a-Porter, Sarah Rutson, 51, had accumulated a world-class wardrobe…full of redundancies. “Did I have 30 black jackets? Yes,” she said. Now based in Los Angeles and working with brands and startups, Ms. Rutson has sold around 50% of her clothing. Her current capsule comprises such sharp but comfortable pieces as Birkenstocks, leather pants, crisp cotton shirts and statement rings.</td>

Textbooks are being rewritten to be more patriotic to China, and some images likely to antagonize Beijing are being removed, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Education is identified in the security law as a key area where greater government oversight is needed—along with the media and the internet. State media ascribed considerable blame for 2019’s social unrest to the city’s liberal school system and teachers. Thousands of students were arrested during monthslong protests, while many more formed human chains and chanted protest slogans in school yards.<br />China’s push to bring up future generations as dutiful citizens, however, is stoking concern among many teachers, students and parents, some of whom say it undermines long-cherished  principles of critical thinking and uncensored debate. Opposition groups say the clampdown is part of Beijing’s broader effort to stifle dissent in the city that has seen dozens of democratic politicians arrested and street protests stamped out.</td>
