      <td>A margin call is not a Wall Street plot to fleece Reddit traders.</td>
      <td>So much for the “rigged” market, the supposed conspiracy to fleece Reddit traders, and other nonsense spouted about last week’s stock market ructions involving  GameStop  and other companies. It turns out the controversy was essentially about a larger than normal clearinghouse call for capital.<br />As David Battan explains nearby, that’s almost certainly the story behind the decision by Robinhood, the internet trading app, to limit trades in certain stocks for a time late last week. Politicians like Sen. Ted Cruz and bar-stool financial analysts claimed to see a plot by the new Robber Barons.<br />The reality is more prosaic. Robinhood and other brokers were deluged by traders looking to invest in GameStop and other shares, often with options contracts that can increase leverage and trading risk. A clearinghouse that processes and settles trades watched the volatile trading and demanded more collateral to cope with potential losses.<br />Robinhood Chief Executive Vlad Tenev explained the demand Sunday night in an interview on a livestream on Clubhouse, a social-networking app. “The request was around $3 billion, which is, you know, about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is,” Mr. Tenev said.<br />A margin call is not a conspiracy. A clearinghouse is an intermediary between buyers and sellers in a financial market. It “clears,” or finalizes, trades and makes sure the parties fulfill the contract and assets are delivered. It also mitigates risk by requiring that trades be backed by enough capital to reduce the chances that one of the trading parties goes bankrupt. This protects investors as well as brokers.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Investigators have made a preliminary determination that the police officer who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt during the U.S. Capitol riot shouldn’t be charged with any crimes in connection with her death, according to people familiar with the review.<br />Ms. Babbitt, who served for more than a dozen years in the Air Force and Air National Guard and became a passionate supporter of former President Donald Trump, died from being shot by a Capitol Police officer after rioters smashed through a door to the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6. She had entered the building as part of a crowd aiming to disrupt the certification of President Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.<br />The officer who shot her had been placed on leave soon after the riot while Ms. Babbitt’s death was being investigated, including on the question of whether it was a violation of her civil rights.<br />The Justice Department said in announcing the investigation that it was following routine procedure for whenever a police officer uses deadly force by having the Washington Metropolitan Police Department examine the shooting. The police investigators have made an initial determination that charges against the officer aren’t warranted, the people said, adding that Justice Department officials haven’t yet made a final determination on the matter. The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington is leading the broader investigation into the riot and prosecuting the more than 150 cases that have resulted to date.<br />A Justice Department spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Any final charging decision would likely have to be approved by senior Justice Department leadership, who haven’t yet been briefed on the matter.</td>

      <td>The U.S. response needs to take into account China’s regional designs.</td>
      <td>From protests in Moscow to Chinese air incursions over Taiwan, the world is wasting no time testing Joe Biden’s foreign policy team of liberal internationalists. On Monday Americans woke up to news of a swift and (so far) bloodless coup in Burma, whose transition to democratic government was touted by the Obama Administration as one of its major achievements.<br />Now the country’s generals are moving to reassert control after their party was walloped in November elections. Aung San Suu Kyi, the top elected leader of Burma (also called Myanmar), wanted to use her mandate to change the constitution to limit the generals’ power. That looks like the trigger for the military’s forced suspension of civilian government and communications blackout.<br />The Biden Administration is rightly denouncing the move, but the U.S. has limited leverage acting alone. The West has used market access as a carrot to urge Burma’s military rulers to cede power to Ms. Suu Kyi. Yet the extent that a power transition actually occurred was exaggerated. A return to economically isolating the country of 54 million on China’s southern border could hurt the Burmese people and play into Beijing’s hands.<br />As our Walter Russell Meadwrote in 2019, “Western fecklessness has made China look to Myanmar like a more stable and reliable partner.” President Trump’s great-power diplomacy was sometimes crudely transactional. Yet the Biden team might be tempted to pivot too far in the opposite direction, stressing liberal values at the expense of core American interests.<br />The top U.S. priority in Asia is limiting Beijing’s ability to control independent states like Burma, which is strategically situated in the Indo-Pacific. China is holding back from condemning the coup, likely in hopes of making diplomatic inroads with a military government.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump went easy on Russia and Vladimir Putin rhetorically while supporting tougher policies than his predecessor. Now President Biden is taking the opposite approach. At least that’s the early message from the Administration’s first decision on arms control and its response to Russia’s growing domestic protests.<br />On Sunday Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he is “deeply disturbed by the violent crackdown” on Russian protesters and the arrests of thousands demanding the release of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Mr. Blinken said Russians are fed up with “corruption” and “autocracy” and added that Mr. Biden delivered a similar message in a phone call with Mr. Putin.<br />Good to hear, but the Administration sent a very different signal by embracing an unconditional five-year extension of the New Start nuclear arms treaty, which Mr. Putin made formal on Friday. The accord is a classic 20th century arms-control treaty that was inadequate when it came into force a decade ago.<br />New Start limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and bombs at 1,550. It also caps the deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles and nuclear-equipped heavy bombers. The deal would have expired Feb. 5, but Mr. Biden took the longest extension possible.<br />This squanders useful diplomatic work by the Trump Administration. While Washington withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) and Open Skies treaties, which Russia was violating, it tried to negotiate a shorter extension to New Start last year.</td>

      <td>Most world leaders hope the new Biden Administration augurs a more, how shall we say, “cooperative spirit” when it comes to allies. An early test, concerning tax policy, highlights how disappointed some may be.<br />The Biden team takes power as other governments are launching a push to grab more revenue from American tech companies. Fiscal jealousy has been rife for years as large U.S. companies such as Google,  Facebook  and  Apple  earned billions of dollars in high-tax-rate jurisdictions while existing tax rules allowed them to book the profits and pay tax in lower-rate countries.<br />This phenomenon provoked varied responses. The stick is an array of digital services taxes imposed by France, Spain and the U.K. targeting revenue—not profits—of the U.S. tech companies. The carrot is a negotiation led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development supposedly to provide tech companies legal certainty by revamping the rules governing taxation of global companies.<br />The Trump Administration cooled on that effort and threatened tariffs against governments imposing discriminatory taxes on U.S. tech firms. Foreign officials hope President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will be more amenable, and Ms. Yellen’s confirmation hearing was marked by promises to work with the OECD.<br />Look closer, however, and problems appear. One proposal would upend decades-old global rules that tax a company where it is headquartered rather than where it does business. The OECD and some governments want to base taxation on where revenue is earned. The OECD also wants a global minimum tax. Each country would commit to taxing at least 12.5% of the profits of companies headquartered there—primarily to make sure the company isn’t paying “too little” via legal planning.</td>

      <td>President Biden doubled down on Donald Trump’s “Buy American” campaign, signing a Jan. 25 executive order that would not only maintain Mr. Trump’s destructive protectionism, but increase the burdens on international trade.<br />Mr. Biden’s new order will keep Mr. Trump’s mandate that the federal government buy goods made domestically. But it adds a new, highly disruptive mandate to raise the threshold for foreign components going into those finished goods, along with the establishment of a panel to reduce the many exemptions the Trump administration had made.<br />Despite its antitrade image, the Trump administration hadn’t even finalized its own “Buy American” rules until two days before leaving office, suggesting a gap between rhetoric and economic reality that the new administration seeks to close.<br />In the wake of Mr. Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, this was a second body blow to Canadian workers. This is because components are key to Canada’s exports to the U.S., which make up around 80% of all of Canada’s exports. Considering that Canada’s two largest exports are natural resources and automotive components, together accounting for nearly two-thirds of Canada’s total exports, the new president seems to be going for his neighbor’s jugular.<br />North American supply chains integrate industries on both sides of the border, especially in the automotive sector. U.S. scrap steel, for instance, is exported to Ontario, where U.S. manufacturers such as Ford and  General Motors  use it to produce vehicles for export back to the U.S. Mandates on where components are made risk shutting countries out of existing supply chains.</td>

      <td>The successful vaccine program followed the model of U.S. mobilization in World War II.</td>
      <td>Every day new questions and criticisms arise about Operation Warp Speed, the public-private vaccine development initiative launched by presidential order in May 2020. Most of that criticism focuses on the distribution bottlenecks that have developed in different states, as Americans are impatient with the slow pace of the rollout. Jen Psaki, President Biden’s press secretary, has claimed to see an “urgent need to address failures of the Trump team approach to vaccine distribution.” Some in the new administration even want to rename the program.<br />Nearly all these claims rest on a misunderstanding both of Operation Warp Speed’s mission and its nature as a government program. While President Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and others dubbed the original project MP2, or Manhattan Project 2, after the crash effort to build an atomic bomb, Operation Warp Speed’s leadership borrowed a more practical model: the industrial mobilization during World War II that produced the so-called Arsenal of Democracy.<br />That model can still push the vaccine rollout over the finish line. Governors and other state officials in particular need to realize the federal government is operating in the wake of a health-care version of Pearl Harbor, and adjust their operations accordingly.<br />From the beginning the principal mission of Operation Warp Speed was the development, manufacturing, and distribution—i.e., shipping—of coronavirus vaccines. To date, the program has managed to produce and deliver about 50 million vaccine doses—all made in the U.S.—with hundreds of millions more on the way. It also had 97,000 certified receivers distributing the vaccine across the U.S.<br />It is the most remarkable achievement in modern medicine, made possible by following the model of the World War II mobilization effort. That model rests on three principles.</td>

      <td>Team Biden will be disappointed if it mistakes them for starry-eyed idealists.</td>
      <td>Sooner or later every new presidential administration experiences that sinking feeling that one of its big ideas may not be working well. For Team Biden, that moment arrived last week as Germany, with widespread support in the European Union, made clear that Europe has no real interest in countering either Russia or China.<br />Warning against the “building of blocs,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told her virtual audience at the World Economic Forum that she thought Europe should not join with either the U.S. or China against the other. Coming on top of an earlier European refusal to defer moving on an EU-China investment accord until the incoming Biden administration could weigh in on the matter, Europe has made its views crystal clear. Uighurs, Hong Kong and the growing military threats in and around the South China Sea matter much less to European policy makers than their commercial interests do.<br />Alexei Navalny’s challenge to President Vladimir Putin has likewise prompted a European response that is less than robust. As democracy activists and human-rights organizations on both sides of the Atlantic sought to pressure Western governments to do something about Mr. Navalny’s detention and the arrests across Russia, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs announced that he was pressing ahead with a previously planned visit to Moscow for meetings with Mr. Putin. Light wrist slaps may follow, but little more.<br />For starry-eyed American liberals—in whose rich fantasies Europe’s chancelleries are inhabited by committed idealists—this may come as a shock. Europeans aren’t from Mars, and some may hail from Venus, as Robert Kagan put it in his 2004 essay “Of Paradise and Power.” But those who rule the Continent come mostly from Pluto, a cold and remote planet named for the ancient god of the underworld—and of wealth.<br />It’s a mistake to see Europeans as idealists merely because they like multilateralism and discount the importance of military power. Multilateralism is a realist program for Europe, not an idealist one. Even the largest European states know that they are too small to figure as great powers on their own; they must work together if they want to sway Washington and Beijing. As Mr. Kagan noted, they also understand that a rules-based international order grounded in multilateral institutions increases European world influence.</td>

      <td>Will Joe Biden speak up for those he credits with making him the man he is today?</td>
      <td>Amid all the pain and disruption, a year of coronavirus has given Americans a new respect for those working to keep daily life as normal as possible, from the frontline nurse to the Amazon delivery man. Near the top of this honor roll is an especially unsung hero: the Catholic-school teacher.<br />The National Catholic Education Association reports that its schools boast a total enrollment of 1,626,291. In ordinary times their teachers do an extraordinary job, especially for their poor and minority students. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor once said, “Catholic schools have been a pipeline to opportunity” for people like her—poor, Latina, raised by a single mom. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, Catholic-school administrators have moved heaven and earth to keep their classrooms open to new generations of Sotomayors.<br />“The science is clear that there is no substitute for in-person learning, especially for poor and minority children most at danger of falling behind,” says Tom Carroll, superintendent of Catholic schools for the Archdiocese of Boston. “Across the nation, the Catholic school approach is to stay open wherever we are allowed.”<br />It’s been a roller coaster. During the first days of the lockdowns, many Catholic schools closed forever because of a cash crunch. Kathy Mears, the NCEA’s interim president and CEO, reckons that Covid forced the closure of 107 Catholic schools, though an exact number is difficult because in many cases other factors were also involved.<br />But a funny thing happened after the shutdowns. Once moms and dads realized that the Catholic schools left standing were staying open through the pandemic, they began moving children out of public school. It’s not been enough to stave off the 6.4% drop in national enrollment the Catholic schools have seen since Covid-19 hit, but it does highlight that these schools are among the few real alternatives parents have today.</td>

      <td>A ‘reign’s length’ of social change in Britain, from the ascension of Elizabeth II to the Beatles, Brussels, Brexit and beyond.</td>
      <td>In one of many audacious assertions in a book that tells the story of Britain from 1952 to the present day, Andrew Marr writes that if Shakespeare was “the hot-glowing cultural figure of the first Elizabethan age, then the Beatles—John, Paul, George and Ringo—performed a parallel role in the second.” The second age is, of course, that of Elizabeth II, whose 69-year reign is the longest of any British monarch, exceeding by more than two decades (and counting) her Tudor namesake’s time on the throne.<br />Mr. Marr, a journalist of stature in Britain—where he is a TV and radio host on the BBC and a former editor of the Independent—calls his book “Elizabethans.” He spurns the definite article in his title, perhaps to make it more easily distinguished from “The Elizabethans” (2011), by A.N. Wilson, with its focus on the late 16th century. And yet, as you read Mr. Marr’s rich and ebullient account of “how modern Britain was forged,” you learn that it makes no sense, in our own time, to speak of an Elizabethan type or national character in the way we do (however superficially) of “the Victorians.” The Britons of today are notably—and sometimes jarringly—different from those of 1952, when a callow Elizabeth II, then 25, acceded to the throne upon the death of her father.<br />The packaging of Britain’s story into a “reign’s length” is attractive nonetheless, because it acknowledges that Queen Elizabeth has been the one truly constant factor in a nation that has been an outlier among major Western powers: Britain has attached and detached itself to and from Europe as it has pleased—while enjoying more enduring links on the wider map than even the United States. Contemporary Britain, writes Mr. Marr, is also “unusual in European terms in its porousness to migration from non-European parts of the world.” All of which make it an attractive national laboratory in which to measure social-political change over generations.<br />Mr. Marr has written an ambitious book in which he accords more attention to subtle social shifts than he does to “the big, visible changes”—things such as the disappearance of bowler hats, the emptying of churches and the springing up of mosques, of which we know already. What fewer of us know, by contrast, are the nuances and shades of change. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, notes Mr. Marr, “the British seem to become cheekier, even rebellious,” and “an insolent contempt for established authority begins to creep in.” The Beatles—whose language, he concedes, was more “banal” than the Bard’s—were part of that rebellion.<br />This shift in mood, though seemingly a spasm of youthful high spirits, would prove to be a herald of broader changes. The 1960s, Mr. Marr tells us, were a period of “generational conflict.” But for most working-class Britons, they were also “a period of greater material wealth.” The Britain of the previous decade, he reminds us, was “a quietly religious, homogeneous, stratified, socially conservative, proud and comparatively closed-off country.” The insular working classes, as he puts it, “had never been to Spain.” Over time, the country acquired the means to travel and eat better food.</td>

Lower courts found the Trump administration exceeded its authority, but the Supreme Court’s conservative majority allowed the reallocations to continue and construction to proceed while appeals were pending.<br />In the asylum case, Ms. Prelogar cited a Jan. 20 directive from the acting secretary of homeland security, David Pekoske, suspending new enrollment in the asylum program, which formally is called the Migrant Protection Protocols.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats will seek to remove contentious freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.)  from her committee assignments if Republicans don’t take action, according to people familiar with the plans.<br />The move increases pressure on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) at a time when he is caught in the party’s political cross-currents after former President Donald Trump’s loss. Stripping a lawmaker of committee assignments takes away an important venue to shape legislation and participate in panel debates, diminishing his or her influence.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said he has spoken to Mr. McCarthy, who has said he plans to meet with Mrs. Greene this week, likely on Tuesday. Mrs. Greene “must be held accountable for her reprehensible statements, and I am discussing with members the best course of action to do so,” Mr. Hoyer said Monday.<br />Mr. McCarthy didn’t respond to a request for comment on the Democrats’ push. If Mr. McCarthy doesn’t strip Mrs. Greene from her assignments on the budget and education committees, Democrats plan to bring up a measure to the Rules Committee on Wednesday afternoon, setting up a floor vote to remove her. The Rules Committee on Monday afternoon posted the resolution, scheduling it for a Wednesday meeting.<br />“It is my hope and expectation that Republicans will do the right thing and hold Rep. Greene accountable, and we will not need to consider this resolution. But we are prepared to do so if necessary,” Mr. Hoyer said.</td>

      <td>Exxon Mobil Corp.  is forming a business unit that will focus exclusively on technologies to lower carbon emissions, as the oil giant faces increasing pressure to step up its sustainability investments.<br />Exxon said Monday that the new business, dubbed “low carbon solutions,” would invest $3 billion through 2025 on lower emission energy technologies, primarily on carbon capture and storage projects, which gather carbon emissions from industrial processes or directly from the air and deposit them underground. Those investments would represent roughly 3% to 4% of Exxon’s planned annual capital expenditures.<br />Exxon has a large research-and-development division that has invested in carbon capture for years, and Exxon says it has captured more carbon than any other company. Currently, the only large-scale use for captured carbon is to help produce more fossil fuels by pumping in the gas to squeeze more oil and gas out of the ground.<br />“With our demonstrated leadership in carbon capture and emissions reduction technologies, Exxon Mobil is committed to meeting the demand for affordable energy while reducing emissions,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said.<br />Exxon is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday after previously disclosing that it would write down as much as $20 billion in assets. It endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020 and has already posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.</td>

On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the meeting between Mr. Biden and the Republicans “is not a forum for the president to make or accept an offer.” She added: “It is important to him that he hears this group out on their concerns, on their ideas.”<br />Pared down from Mr. Biden’s original plan, the proposal from the 10 Republicans omits measures favored by many Democrats, such as aid for state and local governments and raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Republicans said their plan was an opportunity for the Biden administration to follow through on its calls for bipartisanship.<br />“Mr. President, we recognize your calls for unity and want to work in good faith with your administration to meet the health, economic, and societal challenges of the Covid crisis,” the group of senators led by Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) said Monday.</td>

The technology is easily transferable to Iran’s military missile program run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, experts say.<br />The Zuljanah features a solid-fuel-propelled motor that is the largest yet exhibited by Iran. Motors propelled by solid fuel, rather than liquid, are a key component in intercontinental ballistic missiles, which the U.S. seeks to prevent Iran from developing.<br />“After tests…[it] will be ready to put operational satellites in orbit,” said Ahmad Hosseini of the Defense Ministry, according to the IRNA state news agency.<br />While Iran regularly tests new missile technology, Monday’s launch, which was broadcast on national television, was the first since President Biden took office.</td>

Broad economic sanctions such as those used by the George W. Bush and Obama administrations could alienate the country’s population and hurt public attitude toward the West, analysts say.<br />U.S. trade with Myanmar is small. Meanwhile, Beijing enjoys a multibillion-dollar trade and investment relationship with its neighbor and has expressed less public concern than the U.S. about who is in charge. That raises the possibility that any U.S. action could further drive Myanmar toward China, exacerbating tensions between Washington and Beijing as they compete for influence in the region.<br />U.S. options include broadening human-rights sanctions against leaders of the coup that are already in place over the country’s treatment of its Rohingya Muslim minority, and tracking and disclosing the military leaders’ international business dealings.<br />The United Nations Security Council is set to meet on Tuesday to discuss Myanmar in a closed session.</td>

Some participants have been contending aggressive buying could power GameStop-like, quadruple-digit percentage gains in other arenas, with some chatter over the weekend focusing on the roughly $50 billion physical market for silver.<br />Many traders with experience in commodities say the trade is highly speculative. There is more than enough silver to meet industrial demand for everything from semiconductors to solar panels, and producers can raise output to take advantage of higher prices. Previous efforts to corner the market have ultimately preceded crashes, most famously when the Hunt brothers artificially boosted silver in 1979 and 1980.<br />Still, the recent wave of speculation is unlike anything many in commodities have witnessed in the recently past. Shares of miners like  First Majestic Silver Corp.  and  Hecla Mining Co.  have been among the stock market’s best performers recently—each rose 20% or more on Monday—while the largest exchange-traded fund tied to silver logged its biggest-ever daily inflow on Friday. Online silver dealers around the country have even reported soaring demand from retail buyers.<br />“It’s become like the GameStop of commodities,” said Edward Meir, a consultant focused on metals at brokerage ED&F Man Capital Markets. “It doesn’t make any sense… It could be equally ugly on the way down.”</td>

      <td>Even people with asymptomatic Covid cases can have after-effects in their bodies, research indicates, raising questions about possible risks later in life.<br />An estimated one-quarter to one-third of Covid infections are asymptomatic, according to recent studies. Multiple studies have shown asymptomatic patients can have irregular lung scans. A couple of small studies have found cardiac issues in student athletes, including those with asymptomatic infections. And a study looking at asymptomatic and mild cases of Covid in children found signs of possible small blood vessel damage.<br />It’s not yet clear what health consequences any of these after-effects may have, if any, doctors say. Few other viruses have been scrutinized as closely as Covid-19, so it’s possible other viruses leave similar effects without causing major problems. In many cases the damage will likely resolve on its own, doctors note. But they say more research needs to be done to determine what, if anything, the long term effects might be, and whether people should seek monitoring or screening.<br />“There is a risk of internal hits to these people that they are unaware of,” says Eric J. Topol, founder and director of Scripps Research Translational Institute, a medical research facility in La Jolla, Calif. “When things happen slowly in a person, below the surface, you can end up with a chronic situation.”<br />Dr. Topol co-authored a study published online in January in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that estimated that at least one-third of Covid-19 positive individuals are asymptomatic.

Growth is likely to average 2.6% a year through 2025, the CBO said. The agency said a roughly $900 billion relief bill enacted in December would add about 1.5% to the level of GDP this year and next.<br />The latest projections will be closely watched by lawmakers weighing how much additional government support the U.S. economy might need as it recovers from the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact.<br />Senate Republicans released new details of their roughly $618 billion coronavirus-relief proposal on Monday ahead of a meeting later in the day with President Biden.

      <td>THERE’S AT LEAST one upside to not being able to attend a raucous Super Bowl party this year: no competition for the snacks. Perhaps in years past you arrived late to the party and ended up with the only chair without a back, far from the snack table, where the dip disappeared from the bowl long before you could fight your way to it. This year you can tweak the recipe measurements to provide your household personal-size batches of party food, or keep the measurements the same and enjoy the leftovers throughout the week. Whether you want to spice it up with an award-winning wings recipe or satisfy a sweet tooth with raspberry miso cheesecake, these recipes will have you dancing in the end zone.<br />A good rule of thumb for finger foods: The messier it leaves your hands, the better it tastes. Case in point: chicken wings. If you’re up for outdoor grilling try this tangy version tossed with Alabama white sauce and seasoned with plenty of lemon juice. Refine your taco-assembly skills with chef Chris Wallace’s mushroom tacos, which can be whipped up sans meat or with bacon, depending on your preference. For something lighter and highly munchable, try these highly customizable popcorn recipes, with flavors ranging from Bloody Mary to spiced caramel.<br />There aren’t many times in a year when it’s completely acceptable—encouraged, in fact—to count dips as dinner, so why not take full advantage? This buttery oven-baked crab dip carries just the right amount of celery crunch. Serve it with crisp toast rounds—and a simple green salad, if you must. A classic French-onion dip is always a touchdown, and this luscious version topped with caramelized onions scores the extra point. And we strongly encourage you to give the unjustly maligned cheese ball another chance.<br />A good drink goes a long way when it comes to alleviating game-day stress. If you’re craving a bar-quality cocktail but don’t necessarily have a bar-quality setup, don’t worry: with some Tupperware and a tablespoon you can do wonders. Here’s our guide on how to MacGyver a pro-level drink at home. Or maybe you’d rather keep it simple, in which case this recipe for the world’s easiest Margarita will keep your at-home viewing party well lubricated with minimal distraction from the game.<br />No snackadium is complete without a hefty dose of sugar. (There are four quarters to get through, after all.) If you like a dash of salt with your sweets, singer Kelis’s chocolate chunk cookies with potato chips only take 30 minutes to prepare. Or indulge this nutty, caramel-y, brown-butter blondie that will make any dessert-lover question their brownie loyalty.</td>

      <td>Manufacturer promotes Lal Karsanbhai to chief executive; Farr to remain chairman until May</td>
      <td>David Farr, the chief executive of  Emerson Electric Co. , is retiring this week after 21 years in the role and handing over leadership of the manufacturing company to another Emerson veteran.<br />Mr. Farr, who recently turned 66 and took over in 2000, is one of the longest-serving CEOs in the S&P 500. He will remain chairman of the board until May 4.<br />The St. Louis-based industrial company named the head of its automation business, Lal Karsanbhai, to succeed Mr. Farr and join the board. Mr. Karsanbhai will be the fourth CEO at Emerson in 66 years. The 85,000-person conglomerate makes everything from Ridgid pipe wrenches to automation software for power plants.<br />“We are confident Lal is well-positioned to continue building on Emerson’s legacy of success,” Mr. Farr said. He had previously said he planned to retire in 2021, and Emerson’s succession planning for the change spanned five years.<br />Emerson continues to navigate a pandemic that upended its business along with the rest of the global economy. Mr. Farr took a hands-on approach to the crisis and never stopped going to the office with his top executives in 2020, even as much of the world was working from home. The company continued to provide financial projections and kept its dividend intact during a time when companies were hunkering down during unprecedented uncertainty.</td>

      <td>The Biden administration said it has reached a $230 million deal with Australian diagnostics company Ellume USA LLC to produce at-home, over-the-counter Covid-19 tests.<br />The Food and Drug Administration previously authorized the test. So far, the FDA has cleared three Covid-19 tests that can be processed entirely at home, but Ellume’s is the only one that doesn’t require a prescription. None are widely available at this point.<br />The company is expected to produce 19 million tests a month by the end of the year, Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to the White House Covid-19 response team, said Monday. Based on the agreement, 8.5 million tests will be guaranteed to the U.S. government.<br />For months, public health authorities have been calling for rapid, easy-to-use tests for Covid-19 that can be performed anywhere, both to enable people to quickly determine whether or not they have Covid-19 and to allow for wider screening. At-home tests are expected to be less precise than those done in a lab and will likely require a follow-up test in certain situations.<br />Ellume shipped out its first batch of 10,000 tests to the U.S. the week of Jan. 18, the company said last week. Ellume had originally aimed to ship 100,000 tests a day starting in January.</td>

That is 57% higher than a year ago, when the weather was uncommonly warm, yet still about 15% below the price to start this heating season.<br />“An unusually strong response to weekend adjustments to the short-term temperature forecasts,” said Ritterbusch and Associates. The trading firm said prices could approach $3 this month if the weather outlook materializes.<br />Furnaces are firing in the Northeast, where snow started piling up over the weekend. But in much of the country temperatures will remain mild, according to NatGasWeather.com. That should change next week, when an Arctic blast is expected to blow into the Rockies, across the Great Plains and past the Great Lakes. The industry forecaster predicts temperatures will drop low enough in North Texas and other gas-producing regions to freeze well heads and block output.<br />“The largest unknown right now seems to be just how far east the cold will extend and if major populations in Chicago and the East Coast will feel the frost,” Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. analysts wrote in a note to clients.</td>

It also should allow the company to support the hundreds of thousands of new accounts users opened since Thursday and to remove many of the trading restrictions that angered customers of the popular brokerage, the people said.<br />The fundraising deal was structured as a note that conveys the option to buy additional shares at a discount later, the people said.<br />Customers flooded Robinhood and other brokerages with orders to buy and sell a handful of popular stocks last week. GameStop, the stock that kicked off the retail surge, closed Friday at $325. It began the year at under $20.  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,  the battered movie-theater chain, is up more than 500% in 2021.<br />The wild price swings prompted the clearinghouse that processes and settles the trades to ask for more cash to cover potential losses on the transactions.</td>

      <td>The oil megamergers that started in the late 1990s were preceded by circumstances similar to today’s</td>
      <td>Today’s tech stock exuberance is a flashback to the 1990s. Now oil investors are experiencing their own déjà vu.<br />Exxon Mobil  and  Chevron ,  the two largest descendants of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly, discussed a potential merger last year, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. The companies’ shares barely moved Monday morning, perhaps reflecting skepticism that such a deal can happen.<br />As over-the-top as the idea sounds—it could be the largest corporate merger ever—it isn’t inconceivable. Today’s oil market conditions look similar to those that made oil megamergers possible starting in the late 1990s, when the Asian financial crisis led to a sudden collapse in global growth and oil demand. The resulting glut considerably weakened energy giants, leading to cost cuts and paving the way for big tie-ups. Both Covid-19 and Asia’s crisis knocked about a third off the average Brent price in 2020 and 1998, respectively.<br />That backdrop was what preceded Exxon’s merger with Mobil in 1999, number one and two in the U.S. at the time. Chevron’s 2001 nuptials with Texaco brought together what were then numbers two and three. Combined, Exxon and Chevron would satisfy about 4.3% of global oil demand—only a percentage point higher than the combined share of Exxon and Mobil a year after their merger.<br />It is unclear how close the deal is to materializing. Antitrust concerns aside, Chevron investors might be cautious about merging with Exxon as it faces scrutiny from securities regulators and activist investors.</td>

Israel has agreed to give a total of 5,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the Palestinians to inoculate front-line medical workers, they added.<br />The shipment was approved out of health concerns resulting from the mixing of Israeli and Palestinian populations, the officials said. A local committee of professional health advisers last week told the Israeli government that vaccinating the Palestinians is a “clear necessity” for Israel’s battle with the pandemic.<br />Israel two weeks ago had sent the Palestinian Authority 100 doses of a coronavirus vaccine for Palestinian health staff as a one-time humanitarian gesture, according to an Israeli security official.<br />Palestinian Authority officials couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.</td>

      <td>An HBO true-crime series dramatizes the search for answers in the 2017 murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall aboard a Danish entrepreneur’s submarine.</td>
      <td><br /><br />As thriller titles go, “The Investigation” is hardly “Chinatown” or “Vertigo” or “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark.” It rings perversely generic. But by episode 3 of this six-part fact-based fiction, one realizes what exactly “The Investigation” is not, which is “The Murder,” “The Suspect” or “The Trial.” The accused is not only never shown but never named. It’s the detective’s-eye view of a particularly heartbreaking crime, the police procedural extraordinaire—a case that tests its Scandinavian sleuths’ capacity for keeping their cool while finding a killer.<br />The real-life outrage on which it is based—the 2017 dismemberment murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, aboard a Danish entrepreneur’s small submarine in the waters off Copenhagen—made the news world-wide and was a tabloid sensation in Denmark. “The Submarine Case,” as it was called, stymied investigators because of a literal lack of corpus delicti and the fatuous but not-quite-refutable stories of the sub owner: Wall hit her head on the hatch and died. No, there was a vacuum lock on board and she was killed by carbon-monoxide fumes. He couldn’t get the body through the tower, so he cut it up. He buried her at sea because he wanted to spare her parents.<br />No one believed any of it, but as the prosecutor, Jakob Buch-Jepsen (Pilou Asbæk), tells the police—specifically head investigator Jens Møller Jensen (Søren Malling)—without a body they can’t prove a cause of death. Without a cause of death they can’t charge someone with murder.</td>

Her money paid for the lion’s share of the roughly $500,000 rally at the Ellipse where Mr. Trump spoke.<br />Another far-right activist and leader of the “Stop the Steal” movement, Ali Alexander, helped coordinate planning with Caroline Wren, a fundraising official who was paid by the Trump campaign for much of 2020 and who was tapped by Ms. Fancelli to organize and fund an event on her behalf, organizers said. On social media, Mr. Alexander had targeted Jan. 6 as a key date for supporters to gather in Washington to contest the 2020-election certification results. The week of the rally, he tweeted a flyer for the event saying: “DC becomes FORT TRUMP starting tomorrow on my orders!”<br />The Ellipse rally, at which President Trump urged supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol, was lawful and nonviolent. But it served as a jumping-off point for many supporters to head to the Capitol. Mr. Trump has been impeached by the Democrat-led House of Representatives, accused of inciting a mob to storm the Capitol with remarks urging supporters to “fight like hell.”</td>

Fertitta Entertainment Inc., a holding company for Golden Nugget casinos and Landry’s restaurants, will go public by combining with  Fast Acquisition Corp. , it said, citing opportunities in the post-pandemic hospitality and online-gambling sector. Landry’s had been a public company from 1993 to 2010.<br />“After I compared the opportunities provided by a transaction with Fast, versus the traditional IPO route, it became abundantly clear that we could access the capital markets with more certainty and speed if we did a deal with Fast,” said Tilman Fertitta, the sole owner of Fertitta Entertainment.<br />Also known as blank-check companies, SPACs raise money before they develop a business. They use the proceeds to make an acquisition, usually within a couple of years, that converts the target into a public company.<br />Fertitta Entertainment’s deal with Fast will include only the majority of assets and businesses that comprise Golden Nugget LLC and Landry’s LLC—together valued at about $6.6 billion, including about $3.2 billion in net debt—and roughly 31 million shares, or nearly half of the shares outstanding, in the online-casino platform  Golden Nugget Online Gaming Inc.

Democrats can look at two sets of riotous mobs and see treason and insurrection in one and peaceful protest and urgent cries for justice in the other. Teachers unions can observe data that show them at infinitesimal risk from a virus and see a mortal threat to their members’ health. Almost the entire media class can contemplate a New York governor who presides over what is still the nation’s highest death toll from Covid-19, made worse by his own administration’s arrogant diktats, and see a hero of unerring sagacity and competence.<br />So it is with the Great  GameStop  Insurrection of 2021.<br />To the censorious, it’s the latest terrifying threat in the age of mobocracy. The spectacle of individual investors, freely associating on a public social-media platform to turn the tables on a risky bet by hedge-fund managers, has been too much for the more sensitive Wall Street titans and their supporters to watch.<br />Some commentators compared the Reddit rebels to flash mobs looting a convenience store. A former SEC commissioner said the incident was reminiscent of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. Forcing an obscure hedge fund into the arms of an obscure creditor isn’t, I suppose, as thrilling as posing for selfies with Nancy Pelosi’s lectern, but it can be more financially rewarding and is less likely to result in a federal prison term.</td>

      <td>They were minimizing their own financial and regulatory risk, not trying to bail out hedge funds.</td>
      <td>Robinhood, E*Trade, Interactive Brokers and others restricted trading in  GameStop  and other names last week after GameStop surged to $483 intraday—a 10,000% increase since August for a historically brick-and-mortar company with declining revenues and a now-downloadable product. The brokers came in for swift, intense—and misguided—criticism.<br />As with everything else, social media took an extraordinarily complex situation—involving technical aspects of the financial markets, unclear legal standards, and public and private sector actors with valid but differing agendas—and produced a simple morality tale with the online brokers as the evil empire crushing plucky rebels like “u/-_Han-Yolo_-” to protect the hedge-fund Jabba the Hutts who shorted GameStop. Redditors showered Robinhood with vitriol and one-star reviews.<br />Political and social-media opportunists jumped in. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deemed GameStop trading restrictions “unacceptable” and demanded an investigation. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of the Financial Services Committee accused Robinhood of “stealing millions of dollars from their users.” Sen. Ted Cruz took to  Twitter  to “fully agree” with AOC: “Let the people trade.” Elon Musk “absolutely” agreed that Robinhood should be investigated, and called for short selling to be banned as “a scam.” Dave Portnoy, Barstool Sports founder and frozen-pizza reviewer, said to Robinhood executives: “You deserve to be behind bars.”<br />It must be unsettling when most of the internet wants your head in a basket, but Robinhood and the other brokers are in a no-win situation. Brokers are financially liable to the “clearinghouses” that clear and settle U.S. stocks and options, whether or not the clients can pay for their losing trades (so that those clearinghouses can pay the winners on the other side when the trade settles one or two days later).<br />When clients trade, especially on margin, they use the broker’s money to play. Imagine a client buys 100 shares of GameStop for $400 a share, using $20,000 of his own money and borrowing $20,000 from Robinhood. If the stock drops from $400 to $120 (as it did on Jan. 28), the client’s position may be sold for $12,000 due to the margin violation, leaving Robinhood trying to collect an unsecured $8,000 debt from “u/Thicc_Ladies_PM_Me.” Good luck. Multiply this by hundreds or thousands of similar clients. Option trading is worse because the leverage is much greater.</td>

      <td>Are you biased against older people? It may depend, in part, on where you live.<br />A recent study of data collected from all 50 states found that implicit bias—a subconscious negative attitude—against older people was most prevalent in the country’s southeastern and northeastern states, including New Jersey, the Carolinas and Florida. The findings were based on responses of 803,000 people ages 15 to 94 who completed a test involving photos of young and old people and words associated with those images.<br />A second part of the study overlaid age-bias results with each state’s health data, looking at things like diet, smoking and obesity. Those states that ranked high in implicit age bias had a larger percentage of adults with poor health and higher per capita Medicare spending.<br />“When considering what it is like to grow old in the United States, where people live matters,” writes Hannah Giasson, a research fellow at Stanford University and lead author of the study, which was published in July in the European Journal of Social Psychology.<br /></td>

      <td>Facebook Inc.  plans to roll out an in-app prompt aimed at educating users about the handling of their data as it battles  Apple Inc.  over the iPhone maker’s new privacy changes that would require users’ consent to track their behavior and make targeted ads more difficult.<br />The social-media company will show users a screen that includes information about its personalized advertisements. The screen will ask users for permission to use data collected from third-party websites and apps while also describing how certain data is being used, for example, to personalize their experience. The screen will be paired with an Apple prompt related to its new privacy policy, which is expected to be released in the next several months. Facebook plans to test the screen with some users beginning Monday before officially launching it when Apple’s new privacy tool rolls out.<br />“People deserve the additional context, and Apple has said that providing education is allowed,” Facebook said Monday. The company said agreeing to the prompt wouldn’t result in its collecting new types of data, and users who decline it would still see advertisements, albeit less relevant. Apple’s prompt will ultimately be the decisive tool over how user behavior is tracked across apps.<br />Facebook and Apple have been battling for months on several fronts and have become more personal in their criticism lately.<br />Under Apple’s new privacy changes, which will be released in a new software update, many apps will begin asking users whether or not they want their behavior on the web to be tracked for the purposes of personalized ads. Facebook, which relies on such tracking to power its advertisement business, has said the new rules will hurt small businesses. The update has been controversial among the broader advertisement industry, although Apple has said the changes wouldn’t prohibit tracking but would require app makers to obtain users’ permission to do so.</td>

      <td>We answer reader questions about the best way to tackle the six-week exercise regimen, including how to test in and cool down</td>
      <td>The response to the first-ever Wall Street Journal Fitness Challenge has been enthusiastic. Since its Jan. 19 launch, tens of thousands of readers have signed up for the six-week program. Haven’t signed up yet? You can join here.<br />A number of readers wrote in to ask if we could review the basics of the program. Here they are in a nutshell:<br />After signing up, you receive a welcome newsletter asking you to test in by seeing how many steps you can take up and down in 20 seconds, leading with your right foot and then your left foot. Up, up, down, down counts as one step. For an idea on what it should look like, check out this video.<br />Arnie Kander, the NBA sports performance coach who developed the workout, suggests using a step around 7 inches in height. One reader wrote in saying the stairs in her home are 8 inches high, too high for her knees. “Does this mean I have to invest in a step platform?” she asks.<br />Seven inches is what Mr. Kander suggests for a baseline height, but if that feels challenging, go lower. Anything that raises you off the ground and is stable will work, including a sidewalk curb or a low step stool. A lower height might skew your step count compared with other participants, but this program is about improving your movement patterns more than trying to beat other step counts.</td>

      <td>While some hedge funds have been hit hard, ‘Wall Street’ writ large could well profit from the GameStop saga</td>
      <td>There is a widely held view that the  GameStop  megarally has been bad news for Wall Street. But that depends on one’s definition of Wall Street.<br />Certainly last week was challenging for many in places like Greenwich, Conn., or Midtown Manhattan, where many hedge funds are set up. Funds betting against shares of GameStop and other heavily shorted companies have logged big losses. But many others employed in finance and trading may not have had such a bad week.<br />For example, JPMorgan Chase analysts said in a note last week that a daily index they track measuring performance of hedge funds that go long and short equities experienced a decline of about 2% over Tuesday and Wednesday, which the analysts noted wasn’t unusually large and suggested that “any heavy losses in this space would most likely be confined to a few hedge funds.”<br />Individual investors also aren’t alone in the ability to trade beyond fundamentals: Many quantitative funds trade on data signals and price movements. Justin Zhen, co-founder of Thinknum Alternative Data, said he started getting calls from quant firms last week seeking to generate sentiment measures from Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, where much of the discussion among individual investors surrounding shares like GameStop has originated. His data firm began monitoring the forum and providing hourly updates. “I’ve never seen so much inbound for one data set in my life,” he said.<br />What kind of week will it prove to have been in Chicago’s Loop, New Jersey or lower Manhattan, where electronic market-making trading firms have traditionally clustered? The wider spreads, higher volatility and big volume sparked by the Reddit-fueled trades are typically ripe conditions for market makers, which aim to facilitate trading by rapidly buying and selling. At some point trading can become too wild, and technology has strained to keep up with the volume. The attention on Robinhood Markets’ relationships with wholesale market makers that pay for its order flow, such as Citadel Securities, also has been intense. But by at least one measure, it wasn’t a bad week for market makers: Shares of publicly listed electronic market maker  Virtu Financial  rose 12%, its best weekly gain since last March.</td>

      <td>Republican proposal leaves President Biden standing between his promises of action on the virus and fostering bipartisanship</td>
      <td>President Biden and his Democratic Party face a big decision this week, on whether to start trying to push into law a larger coronavirus stimulus bill on their own, or a smaller one with some Republican support.<br />Behind that decision lies an even bigger question: How much of a mandate did Democrats win in November’s election?<br />Mr. Biden and his team are pressing, as a matter of utmost urgency, a $1.9 trillion plan to speed coronavirus vaccinations and help cities, states and the overall economy get past the virus’ economic stranglehold. A group of 10 Republican senators has countered with a much smaller, $618 billion proposal that essentially keeps intact the Biden plan’s funds for vaccination work, shrinks some of the economic stimulus pieces and jettisons others entirely.<br />The Republicans’ proposal leaves the president standing between his two main opening-round promises: to take fast and big action on the virus, and to foster more bipartisanship in Washington.<br />The sentiment among many rank-and-file Democrats is clear. They argue that the size and urgency of the coronavirus package calls for steaming past Republican efforts to slow and shrink the plan and using whatever measures they have at their disposal to pass it, with only Democratic votes if necessary. They fear Republicans will force a downsizing of the package in negotiations, and then oppose it in the end anyway.</td>

      <td>With more Americans wearing masks of all sorts this winter, the full-faced ski mask is back in fashion. Yet, contemporary knitters take pains to make their balaclavas look less off-putting.</td>
      <td>DURING AMERICA’S first winter in the era of widespread face coverings, the curious and sometimes menacing balaclava has surged in popularity. In December, the outdoor emporium REI saw year-over-year sales of the slinky, ninja-evoking items spike 40% and niche retailers and craftspeople have been quickly selling out of small-batch versions for the past couple months. (For anyone who needs a refresher, balaclavas encase one’s head, except for openings that leave the eyes—and less often the mouth—visible.)<br />Boosting the zeistgeisty design’s visibility, raffish sorts like the rapper Fabolous and the NBA’s Russell Westbrook have been photographed recently with their faces cloaked in ski masks (Mr. Westbrook’s was a $50 number from his own fashion label, Honor the Gift.) And it’s worth mentioning that RMR, a sultry singer who wears a black balaclava at all times to cloak his identity, has been fueling the surge since he emerged last February in a viral music video.<br />It would seem these “mug for the camera” stars are tapping into the imposing balaclava’s cool factor. But for your average errand-runner, pulling on a knit balaclava is a purely practical move. Not only does it keep you warm, some treat a mouth-concealing balaclava as a face mask in a pinch when rushing to the post office. Yet a knitted balaclava offers less protection from airborne viruses than an N95 or even a taut cloth mask researchers say. Conscientious adopters of the trend wear a proper face mask beneath their balaclava.<br />Of course, keeping people toasty in sub-zero climes is the ski mask’s original raison d’etre. “In Winnipeg, it’s really, really freaking cold in the winter. So [balaclavas] definitely serve a purpose,” said Shawnee Isaak, 29, a gardener in the notoriously frigid Canadian province of Manitoba who began crafting her own balaclavas this winter. Like many at-home knitters, Ms. Isaak first learned how to stitch by studying YouTube videos. This winter she’s been perfecting her skills—she can now run off a ski mask in about five hours rather than the two days it used to take.<br />With more folks escaping outside this winter to shake off Covid containment boredom, the insulating balaclava is more welcome than ever. Gillian Stadelman, the senior merchandising strategist at REI, noted that sales of gear for “socially distanced” outdoor sports like snowshoeing and cross-country skiing are up as much as 300% year over year. She sees the outdoor outfitter’s balaclava bump as part of the same dynamic. More customers are looking to safely get their fitness in outdoors, and they’re dressing the part in full-face ski masks.</td>

      <td>U.S. government and aerospace-industry officials are removing decades-old barriers between civilian and military space projects, in response to escalating foreign threats beyond the atmosphere.<br />The Pentagon and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are joining forces to tackle efforts such as exploring the region around the moon and extending the life of satellites. Many details are still developing or remain classified.<br />Driving the changes are actions by Moscow and Beijing to challenge American space interests with antisatellite weapons, jamming capabilities and other potentially hostile technology. Those secretive systems, often operated by specially trained forces focused on space dominance, threaten both U.S. military and private assets in orbit, according to a series of reports from the Pentagon, the White House National Space Council and industry study groups. As a result, the Pentagon is intent on tapping civilian expertise and programs to help gain an edge in this emerging warfighting domain.<br />The Space Force is at the center of the action. Gen. John Raymond, the fledgling military branch’s chief of operations, recently unveiled a research partnership with NASA aimed at shielding satellites from lasers or cyberattacks. Eventually, according to government and industry officials briefed on the matter, civil-military cooperation is expected to extend to defending planned NASA bases on the lunar surface, as well as protecting U.S. commercial operations envisioned to extract water or minerals there.<br />Large and small contractors are maneuvering to take advantage of opportunities to merge military and nonmilitary technologies. They include established military suppliers that already have a foot in both camps, such as  Northrop Grumman Corp. , the Dynetics unit of  Leidos Holdings Inc.  and Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. Smaller companies such as Maxar Technologies Holdings Inc., closely held robotic-lander maker Astrobotic Technology Inc. and small-satellite producer Blue Canyon Technologies, recently acquired by  Raytheon Technologies Corp. , also seek to diversify in the same way.</td>

      <td>Day traders fueling enormous gains in popular stocks such as  GameStop  Corp.  are also powering big swings for another suddenly hot investment: so-called blank-check companies.<br />Special-purpose acquisition companies—shell companies planning to merge with private firms to take them public—are rising more than 6% on average on their first day of trading in 2021, up from last year’s figure of 1.6%, according to University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter. Before 2020, trading in SPACs was muted when they made their debut on public markets.<br />Now, shares of blank-check companies almost always go up. The last 140 SPACs to go public have either logged gains or ended flat on their opening day of trading, per a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of trading in blank-check companies through Thursday. One hundred and seventeen in a row have risen in their first week. The gains tend to continue, on average generating bigger returns going out to a few months.<br />The gains in companies that don’t yet have any underlying business underscore the wave of speculation in today’s markets. Merging with a SPAC has become a popular way for startups in buzzy sectors to go public and take advantage of investor enthusiasm for futuristic themes.<br />But lately, day traders are even putting money into SPACs before they have revealed what company they are buying. At that stage, they are pools of cash, so investors are wagering that the company will eventually complete an attractive deal.</td>

      <td>In 1896, former U.S. lawmaker and silver lover William Jennings Bryan attacked those that would “crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.” Reddit investors now risk building their own cross of silver.<br />On Monday, the price of silver futures jumped about 11% to around $30 an ounce—its biggest one-day move since 2009—after becoming the latest target of the individual investors who spent last week foiling Wall Street’s short bets. By coordinating security purchases online, these amateur day traders have triggered surges in unloved stocks such as  GameStop ,   BlackBerry  and  American Airlines .<br />“Silver Bullion Market is one of the most manipulated on earth,” user RocketBoomGo wrote Saturday on Reddit, encouraging individual investors to push the silver price up to $1,000. “Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. We know [that a] billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation.”<br />The Reddit crowd may have—so far—been successful in upending the market for little-traded stocks. In the far more liquid silver market, though, they may have worse luck.<br />Previous attempts to corner the silver market have failed. Back in 1979, three of the sons of Texan oil billionaire H.L. Hunt managed to push silver prices up eightfold, only for them to crash following a change in rules on leveraged purchases of commodities—notably on March 27, 1980, known as “Silver Thursday.” That happened despite the Hunt brothers owning more than a third of the world’s non-governmental supply of silver, which speaks to the difficulty of manipulating this deep market. Also, official data suggests hedge funds are betting in favor of silver, not against it. The chances of retail investors inflating a bubble that hurts Wall Street more than themselves seem even slimmer than with GameStop shares.</td>

Activists and journalists in the country feared they might also be arrested after civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior officials were detained in a predawn raid.

      <td>The company looks set to surpass its last record earnings year in 2009—but the fact that that was so long ago holds some warnings for the future</td>
      <td>Nintendo  has ridden the stay-at-home wave toward another high score, far exceeding market expectations. But if it doesn’t heed the lessons of its last record-breaking year over a decade ago, investors might need to wait a long time for the next adrenaline rush.<br />The Japanese game giant’s operating profit for the quarter ending in December almost doubled from a year earlier. That is even higher than the most bullish estimate on S&P Global Market Intelligence. It’s also within touching distance of its most profitable quarter ever in 2008, when its Wii and DS consoles were selling like hot cakes. The Covid-19 pandemic has driven stay-at-home demand for its Switch consoles as well as games like “Animal Crossing: New Horizons.” Production and delivery bottlenecks also limited shipments of new competing consoles from  Sony  and  Microsoft  during the holiday season. Nintendo sold 24.1 million of its Switch consoles in the past three quarters, taking the total to nearly 80 million. Wii’s lifetime sales, in contrast, were 101.6 million units.<br />Nintendo will almost certainly have its most profitable year on record when the fiscal year ends this March. The company raised its operating profit forecast for the fiscal year by 24% Monday to ¥560 billion, equivalent to $5.34 billion, already higher than the record notched in the fiscal year ending in March, 2009. But that is likely still too conservative. Nintendo’s share price is also near a record high, only 13% below its 2007 peak, after gaining 42% since the beginning of 2020.<br />Nintendo’s current winning streak is reminiscent of the Wii console boom days more than a decade ago. With the Switch console going into its fifth year, Nintendo should be careful to avoid the subsequent bust that followed last time. The financial crisis and the rise of smartphones aggravated the situation back then. But the company didn’t manage to keep up the momentum from the runaway success of the Wii console. Wii U, the successor to Wii, was a flop. Nintendo dipped into losses for two consecutive years in 2013 and 2014.<br />Keeping gamers coming back with Nintendo’s own exclusive titles or an upgraded version of the Switch console will be key. Better online services could be another way to hold on to capricious gamers: Nintendo’s digital sales accounted for 41% of its total game sales over the past three quarters, an improvement from previous years. The pandemic has boosted Nintendo’s game business, but has also undermined an alternative way to make money from the company’s popular franchises: the opening of Super Nintendo World in Universal Studios Japan has been delayed twice.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden will host a group of Republican senators to discuss a coronavirus-relief bill after they proposed a $600 billion plan, as Democrats prepared to advance the White House’s $1.9 trillion package without GOP support.<br />Mr. Biden issued the invitation to the 10 Republican senators, asking they come to the White House early this week for a “full exchange of views,” the White House said in a statement Sunday evening. It said Mr. Biden made the invitation in a conversation with Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), who helped organize the Republican proposal.<br />The meeting with Mr. Biden and GOP senators was set for 5 p.m. ET Monday, according to the president’s public schedule released late Sunday.<br />In a letter Sunday, the Republican senators asked to meet with Mr. Biden to present details of their proposal and said they were coming forward in response to his appeal for bipartisanship.<br />The GOP proposal would cost around $600 billion, according to Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), who signed the letter, less than one-third of what Mr. Biden has proposed. Republicans said they would retain the $160 billion the Biden package includes to increase vaccinations and take other efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus, but strip or scale back other measures. The GOP plan, for instance, would reduce the $1,400 direct payments to Americans Mr. Biden has called for to roughly $1,000, Mr. Cassidy said on “Fox News Sunday.”</td>

      <td>Internet giant’s results expected to shed new light on the costs of its cloud business</td>
      <td>As Google steps on the gas at its burgeoning cloud business, investors would do well to remember that this is no cheap ride.<br />When parent company  Alphabet Inc.  reports fourth-quarter results Tuesday afternoon, the company plans to break out its Google Cloud business as a reportable segment. That will include information on the unit’s costs and profitability; Alphabet has been reporting Google Cloud revenue for a year now. The additional details should bring the company more in line with its top cloud peers  Amazon.com  and  Microsoft ,  both of which report segment profitability for their respective—though not easily comparable—cloud operations.<br />Investors have typically welcomed such details. Amazon’s share price more than doubled in 2015, helped greatly by the company’s decision to break out numbers for its AWS cloud business. Those details showed AWS to be more profitable than expected—and way more profitable than Amazon’s retail business. AWS’s operating margins were 12% in the first quarter of 2015 and they climbed to 24% by the end of the year. Amazon’s retail side was generating operating margins of less than 2% at the time.<br />That will be very hard for Google to match, though. Amazon in 2015 had a very big lead in the cloud market, which gave it the ability to take some profits while still investing heavily in the business. Google—running a distant third to Amazon and Microsoft—is playing an expensive game of catch up. Its capital expenditures have averaged 14% of revenue over the past five years compared with 10% for both Amazon and Microsoft. Speaking of Google’s Cloud business, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on the company’s last earnings call that they “do intend to maintain a high level of investment given the opportunity we see.”<br />Google also has a much more profitable mainstay business. With 81% of revenue still coming from advertising, Alphabet’s core Google division has generated operating margins of 24% over the past four quarters. The cloud represents Google’s best shot yet to diversify that business, so Google is right to shine more light on it. Investors should just brace for some sticker shock.</td>

      <td>Robinhood Markets Inc. blocked trading of volatile stocks such as  GameStop  last week after a clearinghouse asked for $3 billion to back up the trades, the trading app’s chief executive said in an interview posted online.<br />Robinhood and other brokers experienced a deluge of demand from users to invest in a handful of popular stocks and options contracts. Wild moves in the value of those stocks and options prompted clearinghouses that process and settle trades to demand increased cash collateral to insulate themselves from possible losses.<br />“The request was around $3 billion, which is, you know, about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is,” Robinhood Chief Executive Vlad Tenev said. He spoke Sunday night in an interview alongside Tesla boss Elon Musk on a live stream of Clubhouse, an invitation-only social networking app popular in Silicon Valley.<br />A Robinhood spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the online interview.<br />Robinhood blocked trading in more than a dozen stocks and related options on Thursday. It loosened restrictions Friday but still allowed only limited trading. Mr. Tenev said the trading app will be able to further relax the “stringent position limits” on the securities on Monday after last week’s capital raise.</td>

      <td>The coup deals a major blow to the country’s transition to democracy</td>
      <td>Myanmar’s military seized control of the government on Monday, detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and senior members of her National League for Democracy party and dealing a major blow to the country’s historic transition to democracy.<br />Tensions with the military have risen in recent months after Ms. Suu Kyi’s party won national elections in a landslide, and the military-backed opposition party disputed the election process. The military alleged that the voter lists had false names and said its attempts to resolve the issue were rebuffed by the election commission. The election commission has denied there was widespread election fraud.<br />On Monday, which was scheduled to be the first day of parliament since the elections, the military said it was imposing a state of emergency.<br />Yes. Myanmar’s military never fully relinquished power, retaining control of key government ministries and a chunk of parliamentary seats even after Ms. Suu Kyi’s party was elected in 2015. But the coup puts the military fully back in control. Power has been transferred to army chief Min Aung Hlaing, according to an announcement made Monday on an army-run television channel.<br />Ms. Suu Kyi is the daughter of Aung San, a politician and military leader who helped the country gain independence from British colonial rule in 1948. She rose to prominence decades later when she took on the country’s generals and was put under house arrest in 1989, a year before the party she led won national elections. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 and spent 15 years in detention over two decades, becoming one of the world’s most prominent political prisoners. She was released in 2010 as the country began its transition to democracy. Her party, the National League for Democracy, came to power in a 2015 vote that marked a historic shift in the country’s politics. She has served in the role of state counselor rather than president, but effectively led the Southeast Asian country before Monday’s coup.</td>

      <td>Investors have little way to gauge the likely success of new electric-vehicle ventures before they launch their make-or-break products</td>
      <td>Here’s a rule of thumb for investors looking for the next Tesla: Wait for the futuristic vehicles pictured in company presentations to hit the road.<br />Electric-vehicle startups are racing onto the stock market through special-purpose acquisition companies or SPACs. The latest is Faraday Future, which after years of financial troubles has finally bagged a deal to get its first luxury EV to launch next year. Shares in  Property Solutions Acquisition Corp. , the blank-check company acquiring Faraday, have risen 42% since the announcement Thursday.<br />The happy couple join at least a dozen other EV ventures and SPACs that have announced similar mergers over the past half year or so. The deals have triggered trading surges and stock-market valuations ranging from speculative to incomprehensible, underpinned by the rally in Tesla’s even more highly valued shares.<br />Not all of the startups will compete head on with Tesla like Faraday and Fisker, another Californian company with a luxury EV in the works. Others want to develop battery EVs for commercial transportation (Lordstown, Arrival,  Canoo ); trucks powered by hydrogen (Nikola); or next-generation batteries ( QuantumScape ).<br />What these companies have in common, though, is a reliance on big products to transform their finances and justify their valuations in two, three or more years’ time. In an increasingly crowded market, not all these products can live up to their billing, but some just might. How to know which?</td>

Blink Blink nod nod, can we find a place for his son…” Another email that said while the young man “does not interview well,” he was likely to get a job offer from somewhere given an IPO mandate was up for grabs.</td>

      <td>China’s short-term lending rates shot up to their highest levels in two years last week</td>
      <td>Markets in the U.S. are going haywire, but since the economy is also in the tank, central bankers are hesitant to step in and spoil the fun. Not so in China. Markets there look bubbly too and the central bank isn’t amused.<br />China’s short-term lending rates shot up to their highest levels in two years last week, with the weighted average of the one-day interbank collateralized repo hitting nearly 7% Friday. As recently as Friday, Jan. 22, it was only 2.5%. Chinese short-term borrowing rates often jump ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday as holiday cash demand rises, but usually the central bank offsets that with big injections into the banking system. This time, not so much: the People’s Bank of China had hardly added any net liquidity in January as of mid last week, Morgan Stanley noted on Wednesday. Adding to investors’ skittishness, Chinese media last week reported comments from Ma Jun, an adviser to the central bank, warning of asset bubbles.<br />All of this should tell investors a couple things. First, policy makers believe that the risks of turbulence in the bond market—which was rocked by the defaults of several state-owned firms in November—have receded. After central bank data showed net corporate bond financing falling abruptly to its lowest levels since 2018 in November and December, bond financing has now apparently recovered. By mid-January, yields had dropped back and January data from Wind shows that net corporate bond financing has bounced back as well.<br />Second, Beijing still feels comfortable enough with the pace of the recovery—despite weaker-than-expected economic data in December and a faltering January purchasing managers index—to let market rates rise as a warning to stock and real-estate speculators. Before the sharp rise in interbank rates last week, Shenzhen’s tech-heavy ChiNext index had shot up about 13% this year and Shenzhen A-shares as a whole were trading at around 25 times the next 12 months expected earnings according to FactSet, their priciest since 2016. Overall margin debt in China had also started rising rapidly again.<br />China’s recovery is far ahead of the West’s, as its credit growth cycle has already peaked. That means, most likely, the peak in earnings growth isn’t far behind. With U.S. stocks in full-blown euphoria, China might seem like a better bet—but both on fundamentals and liquidity, the rally in Chinese stocks might actually run out of steam first.</td>

It runs video advertisements, has an Instagram account, and posts job openings on LinkedIn.

The discussions were described as preliminary and aren’t ongoing but could come back in the future, the people said.<br />Such a deal would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911, and reshape the oil industry.<br />A combined company’s market value could top $350 billion. Exxon has a market value of $190 billion, while Chevron’s is $164 billion. Together, they would likely form the world’s second largest oil company by market capitalization and production, producing about 7 million barrels of oil and gas a day, based on pre-pandemic levels, second only in both measures to Saudi Aramco.<br />But a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. President Biden has said climate change is one of the biggest crises the country faces. In October, he said he would push the country to “transition away from the oil industry.” He hasn’t been as vocal about antitrust matters, and the administration has yet to nominate the Justice Department’s head of that division.</td>

      <td>Portland may kill Oregon’s only glass-bottle recycling plant.</td>
      <td>Here’s a story straight out of Portlandia. In the name of improving air quality and addressing climate change, the Rose City is considering penalties that could drive a recycling plant out of business and kill union jobs.<br />Portland declared a climate emergency last year, and the City Council voted to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. To meet this goal that would have no effect on the climate, Portland’s Bureau of Planning and Sustainability wants to impose some $11 million in annual fees on city businesses. Facilities deemed “major stationary sources of air pollution” would pay an annual surcharge of up to $40,000, and Portland would also impose a per-ton fee on any facility that emits more than 2,500 metric tons of C02 a year.<br />The carbon taxes would fall especially hard on Portland’s  Owens-Brockway  Glass Container plant, which handles all of the state’s glass-bottle recycling and processes the equivalent of 440,000 beer bottles a day on average. If the City Council adopts the proposal, the plant would have to pay an estimated $1.1 million a year, more than any Portland facility except the Evraz steel mill, according to the newspaper Willamette Week. The recycling plant pays $1.6 million in income, real-estate and property taxes.<br />United Steelworkers Local 330 represents some of the plant’s 115 employees, and president Bob Tackett says he has “a lot of concerns” about the consequences. “These jobs were green jobs before it was popular to be a green job,” and they come with high wages and good benefits, “so I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around why we’re trying to push these jobs away or penalize these jobs.”<br />In a letter to the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, Owens-Brockway expressed “grave concerns” and warned that the taxes could “devastate select businesses.” Jules Bailey of the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative said that if the plant went bust, the state’s glass bottles would end up in landfills or be shipped out of state.</td>

      <td>New Hampshire tries to protect workers from a pandemic revenue grab.</td>
      <td>Can a state collect income tax from nonresidents working remotely for in-state businesses? Massachusetts, New York and some other states claim they can, and now New Hampshire is asking the Supreme Court to protect its citizens from this tax grab.<br />Tens of millions of Americans have been working from home during the pandemic, including an estimated 2.1 million who used to commute to the office across state lines. Enter Massachusetts, which in April adopted an emergency regulation declaring that nonresidents employed in the state before the pandemic must still pay its 5% income tax even if they are working remotely.<br />Most states tax only income earned—proportional to their employment activities—within their borders. So a hedge-fund manager who splits his time equally between offices in Fairfield, Conn., and Miami only has to pay Connecticut income tax on half his salary. The same rule applies for athletes, consultants and other professionals.<br />However, five states besides Massachusetts (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Arkansas, Nebraska) tax nonresidents working at home. New York requires nonresidents who telecommute for an in-state employer to pay its income tax unless “necessity, as distinguished from convenience, obligate the employee to out-of-state duties.”<br />If an employee of a New York-based firm chooses to work most days from home in another state, New York still taxes him as if he worked the entire day in Manhattan. In October state tax regulators said there would be no pandemic exception for nonresident telecommuters unless their employer “established a bona fide employer office at [the] telecommuting location.”</td>

      <td>Will he negotiate with the GOP or jam $1.9 trillion through on a party-lline vote?</td>
      <td>Americans are about to learn whether President Biden means what he has said so often about governing in a bipartisan fashion. The test is whether he negotiates with Senate Republicans over his $1.9 trillion Covid spending bill, or jams it through using a budget maneuver that requires only 50 votes plus Vice President Kamala Harris.<br />Democratic leaders seem eager to use what’s known as budget reconciliation that dodges the 60-vote filibuster bill for tax and spending measures with certain limitations. After even moderate Republican Senators balked at the gigantic size of the $1.9 trillion Biden Covid-palooza, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said they’ll move soon to pass the bill on a partisan basis using reconciliation.<br />Mr. Biden hasn’t committed himself to the Pelosi-Schumer strategy, though that seems to be where his advisers are tilting. The President speaks so little in public, and in such a scripted fashion, that it’s hard to know what he really thinks.<br />But 10 GOP Senators have raised the governing stakes for Mr. Biden when they offered to meet the President part way and asked for a meeting to talk it over. They say they’ll release more details on Monday, but the text of their weekend letter to Mr. Biden sure looks like it offers most of what he wants.<br />They commit to $160 billion for Covid-related spending on vaccine development and distribution, therapies, testing and tracing and PPE. They say, without offering a price tag, that they support more payments for individual Americans “with the greatest need, providing more targeted assistance than in the Administration’s plan.” That probably means a lower cutoff for additional $1,400 cash payments.</td>

      <td>The true story (so far as we can know it) of a woman from rural New York who became a highly productive OSS agent in WWII Spain.</td>
      <td>On the first page of this real-life espionage thriller, author Larry Loftis writes: “In most cases, a spy cannot survive without being a consummate liar.” For that reason, when a friend spoke admiringly of the works of Aline Griffith—a glamorous American who had been an agent in Spain during World War II and, decades later, wrote a series of memoirs about her exploits—Mr. Loftis decided to find out just how truthful her spy stories might be.<br />Mr. Loftis, whose last book was “Code Name: Lise” (2019), a biography of Britain’s most decorated female wartime spy, started with what Griffith had written herself. She was the author of several books, most notably the bestselling trilogy “The Spy Wore Red,” “The Spy Went Dancing” and “The Spy Wore Silk” (1987-91), all published under her married name—Aline, Countess of Romanones. A beautiful young ex-model, Griffith was sent to Madrid in 1944 as a coder, but her real assignment was to look for Nazi sympathizers. Dressed in Balenciaga, she infiltrated the highest echelons of Spanish society, entering a world of gala soirées, exclusive nightclubs and grand country estates. Throw in bullfights, flamenco, double agents and a handful of murders, and you have the makings of a page-turning literary franchise.<br />Mr. Loftis explains that it’s difficult for former spies to prove the veracity of events when, for security reasons, their reports have been omitted from official records. Spies are restricted by oaths of secrecy and don’t usually produce memoirs until decades after active service, so their recollections may be inaccurate or highly embellished.<br />A meticulous researcher, Mr. Loftis consulted the published and unpublished memoirs of Griffith’s colleagues, and compared her stories with theirs. He also pored over OSS records and recently declassified documents in Portugal and Spain. In the end, although he describes her books as “historical fiction,” he concluded that Griffith was indeed a highly productive agent, and despite elisions and embroidering, her overall story was legitimate. But she did make up numerous incidents and several murders. Mr. Loftis could confirm only one of the five killings she wrote about in her trilogy; it was verified by the person who carried the corpse away.<br />“The Princess Spy” is the kind of popular biography that quotes conversations verbatim and tells you what characters are thinking. Mr. Loftis recounts information from the countess’s books in instances where he feels the truth was borne out, and he’s scrupulously documented his findings in 63 pages of endnotes. He divides the story into short chapters that end with cliffhangers, like scenes from a film noir. The result is a fast-paced, edgy and highly engaging yarn.</td>

      <td>But new variants pose an undetermined threat. The flu-vaccine system can be a model for regulators.</td>
      <td>Some good news this week:  Johnson & Johnson ’s  vaccine looks likely to become the third U.S. Covid-19 vaccine to enter the market. The company released data this week showing the vaccine is about 70% effective against the virus, and its version requires only one shot. The Food and Drug Administration will need to review the evidence thoroughly, but the preliminary data is promising. The company is collecting more information to determine whether a booster shot could provide even better protection.<br />Crushing Covid will require making the most of the different vaccine candidates, which come with their own pros and cons, and tweaking them to stay ahead of viral mutations. The vaccines all follow a similar basic approach, putting into arms the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. But Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine takes a slightly different approach to delivery than vaccines produced by  Pfizer  and Moderna. (I am on the board of Pfizer.) The biotech company  Novavax  is pursuing a vaccine candidate with its own special delivery system. All four might be available by the summer, which would mean an ample supply.<br />Americans will wonder which one works best? It will be tempting to compare data across trials. But that isn’t apples to apples; the vaccines and the data aren’t all the same. And new variants of Covid may demand vaccines that offer slightly different layers of protection and target slightly different parts of the virus.<br />The regulatory process must encourage this kind of portfolio diversification, while allowing tweaks to keep ahead of the virus’s twists and turns. The FDA is working on guidance to address new variants, which will include a pathway for updating vaccines.<br />The model should be the flu-vaccine process. Every year scientists develop the basic components for flu vaccines that are capable of targeting many different strains of the virus. But only the three or four strains expected to be most prevalent are put into production. The rest stay on the shelf, ready to be put into production should the flu take an unexpected evolutionary turn. The FDA should do the same for Covid.</td>

      <td>To hold his climate vows, he’ll have to downsize the fossil fuels industry aggressively—costing jobs.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration has hit the ground running on its climate agenda, but it’ll have to break into a dead sprint if it wants to reach its environmental goals. Before the sun had set on Inauguration Day, the Keystone XL pipeline project had been canceled (for the second time), oil and gas leasing activity had been suspended on federal lands (both onshore and offshore), and the U.S. had committed to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Yet none of these policies will come close to meeting the promises President Biden made during his campaign—notably, eliminating carbon pollution from domestic power plants by 2035 and realizing a “net zero” economy by 2050. To find out if he’ll take the radical steps necessary, watch the Dakotas.<br />Mr. Biden’s recent moves on energy policy will make future oil and gas expansion difficult, but that’s not going to be enough. The American energy industry is already consolidating after an unprecedented multiyear period of growth—punctured by last year’s pandemic-related demand shock—so the blow to the sector is likely to be glancing. If the president intends to keep his vows on carbon emissions and the like, his administration will have to reduce the size of the fossil fuel industry aggressively, not merely curtail its growth.<br />If he’s willing to do that—which seems likely given the cast of true climate believers slated to head up various regulatory agencies—the first target will probably be the Dakota Access Pipeline.<br />The 1,172-mile pipeline currently transports an average of 570,000 barrels a day of crude oil from the Bakken Formation beneath Montana and North Dakota to the Midwest and Gulf Coast refined-product markets. Dakota Access stalled in the waning days of the Obama administration but President Trump approved the project and it was placed into service in 2017.<br />Over the past three years, the pipeline and its corporate sponsor, Energy Transfer, have been dogged by lawsuits from Native American groups and environmentalists, even though the pipeline system has had no reported environmental or safety issues to date.</td>

      <td>She appreciated the first GOP president and carried a gun.</td>
      <td>President Biden may revive an Obama-era initiative of which conservatives ought to approve: putting Harriet Tubman on the obverse of the $20 bill, where Andrew Jackson now appears. Tubman, who died in 1913, was an abolitionist and civil-rights pioneer who’d been born into slavery circa 1822. Then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced in April 2016 that Jackson, the first Democratic president, would appear on the reverse of the Tubman note, which would enter circulation by 2020.<br />Mr. Lew said Tubman represented “the essential story of American democracy”: “So much of what we believe has changed for better for this country is reflected in what she struggled for.” But after Donald Trump, a Jackson admirer, became president, the Treasury changed its tune. Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in 2017 that the switch was still under consideration, but “people have been on the bills for a long period of time,” and there were “more important issues to focus on.” In 2019 Mr. Mnuchin announced that because of “counterfeiting issues,” the switch would be delayed until 2028.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki now says the Biden administration is “exploring ways to speed up” the change to the $20 bill. Republicans should claim Tubman as one of their own. She was friendly with William Seward, secretary of state to the first GOP president, Abraham Lincoln.<br />At first she didn’t admire Lincoln. Frustrated that white soldiers were paid more than black soldiers in the Union Army, she blamed the president for the disparity. “No, I’m sorry now, but I didn’t like Lincoln in them days,” she told Rosa Belle Holt in an 1896 interview for the Chautauquan. “I used [to] go see Mrs. Lincoln, but I never wanted to see him. You see, we colored people didn’t understand then he was our friend.” Although she never met Lincoln, Tubman’s opinion changed after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and met with her friend and fellow abolitionist Sojourner Truth in 1864.<br />Tubman would also likely have been an advocate for gun rights. She carried a pistol for protection when helping fugitive slaves achieve freedom through the Underground Railroad and when acting as a Union spy and scout during the Civil War.</td>

      <td>The spirit of the Mexican president’s government is about centralizing power.</td>
      <td>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador—a k a AMLO—has been known to bristle when critics liken him to the late Hugo Chávez. But the parallels between the spirit of Mr. López Obrador’s two-year-old government and that of the Venezuelan strongman’s in its early years are impossible to ignore.<br />Morena, AMLO’s party, launched an effort in the Mexican Senate in December to seize autonomy from the country’s central bank. The lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, will discuss the bill this week. The president seems to be backing off the idea, but if so it is only a tactical retreat.<br />AMLO is on a mission to complete what he calls “the fourth transformation” of Mexico, and he has to centralize power to do it. He has already wrested control of the Supreme Court, and last month he proclaimed that autonomous regulatory bodies like the federal antitrust commission and the office that provides transparency in federal contracts should be eliminated.<br />Ahead of the June midterm elections he is signaling that he is ready to buck the authority of two independent bodies charged with ensuring election fairness. Mexican democrats are in a fight for their political lives.<br />There are obvious differences between AMLO and Chávez. But when the history is written I suspect most of them will turn out to have been driven by economic constraints on the Mexican caudillo, not choice.</td>

Preliminary data also reflects apparent underreporting to DOH by some nursing homes of resident deaths occurring in nursing homes. In fact, the OAG found that nursing home resident deaths appear to be undercounted by DOH by approximately 50 percent.</td>

It has also gone through a period of high executive turnover, with Chief Executive George Sherman—a longtime retail executive who joined GameStop in 2019—being the fifth person to hold the role since November 2017.<br />To preserve its business, Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop has been working to pay down debt and pledged to accelerate its e-commerce operations. In the recent holiday season, the company’s e-commerce sales rose more than 300% from the comparable year-earlier period, helped by the release of new videogame consoles from  Microsoft Corp.  and  Sony Corp.<br />One of GameStop’s newest board members, Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen, urged the company last year to exit underperforming stores in the U.S. He also called for the company to close nonessential operations in Europe and Australia and use the proceeds to make tech improvements, such as revamping GameStop’s online store.</td>

      <td>Automatic government stimulus based on economic growth or unemployment rates opens the door to all sorts of manipulation.</td>
      <td>Jason Furman argues that “Biden’s Stimulus Should Stay the Course” (op-ed, Jan. 26) with an enhancement that would put it on autopilot to continue assistance as long as the economy is weak and needs it. He proposes that the stimulus be upgraded to “recession insurance” available on a permanent basis to mitigate future economic downturns. Rather than rely on politicians to rise to the challenge when crises first hit, poor economic results would trigger immediate increases in unemployment benefits, automatic fiscal assistance for states and more federal funding for other benefits such as nutritional assistance. Recession-triggered spending would phase out when no longer needed.<br />A permanent autopilot for recession-fighting stimulus is a tempting but ultimately terrible idea. Automatic government stimulus based on economic growth or unemployment rates opens the door to all sorts of manipulation, gaming of the system, counterproductive behavior and unintended consequences. Businesses, investors, workers and consumers make decisions based on expectations. Will a softening of the economy prompt, say, quicker and more consequential decisions that accelerate layoffs and belt-tightening because Washington will be an automatic backstop? In theory, establishing automatic triggers for wages and benefits to rise when inflation goes up is a way to protect people, but the real-world effect of an economywide inflation protection would be an out-control-price spiral.<br />An autopilot for stimulus likely would affect wage, hiring and layoff decisions by corporations, and spending and taxing decisions by state and local governments. If Washington provides a safety net for states whenever the economy softens, there is a disincentive for states to ever bite the bullet and be more fiscally prudent.<br />Mark Adams<br />Atlanta</td>

Hawley objected to the certification of electoral votes following the riot inside the U.S. Capitol.<br />Mr. Spence certainly has the right to publish—or decline to publish—whatever he chooses. However, every publishing house, newspaper and magazine has the right to choose what is published under its banner, including a perceived lack of the opportunity to make a profit. This is not restricting anyone’s freedom of speech; it is making a business decision.<br />I suspect he is counting on the fact that controversy is likely to increase sales beyond what the book otherwise would have generated. In this era of self-publishing, it is impossible to prevent a book from being published, and Sen. Hawley could have taken that path. Mr. Spence appears to be seizing this moment, using the notoriety Sen. Hawley has gained, to generate publicity for his own business. That is his right, but let’s not pretend he is doing so to defend Sen. Hawley’s right to free speech.<br />Teri Geske<br />Los Angeles</td>

      <td>President Biden’s pledge to heal and unify seems to mean giving the far left everything it demands in the culture wars. Conservatives therefore must resist. Yet in doing so we must avoid the trap of framing every debate as if it were about religious liberty.<br />Religious liberty is important, but it’s only part of the story. As the Biden administration advances a divisive and extreme social agenda, our response can’t simply be a polite request to be left alone. We need to oppose the left’s agenda on the merits. It’s the principled thing to do, and it will be good politics given where the American people actually are on the issues.<br />Take Mr. Biden’s decision to overturn the Mexico City policy and call for repeal of the Hyde Amendment. Those policies long prevented taxpayers from funding—and thus being complicit in—elective abortions, overseas and at home. But protecting pro-life people’s right to dissent isn’t the most important reason to oppose abortion funding. The complicity matters because killing unborn babies is profoundly unjust. Conservatives’ refusal to fund abortions communicates that message, which is why the left has turned against popular consensus to oppose the Hyde Amendment—including Mr. Biden, who caved to pressure after supporting Hyde for 40 years.<br />Or consider Mr. Biden’s approach to gender ideology: “Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights.” By his own admission, he’s not looking for common ground—as reflected in his day-one executive order directing that all citizens, including children, be recognized by their declared gender in federal law.<br />Conservatives have no choice but to push back. And here, too, the terrain to defend is not primarily about religious liberty, or religion at all. Children feeling discomfort with their bodies shouldn’t be told the lie that they’re “trapped in the wrong body,” nor should adults pump them full of puberty-blocking drugs and cross-sex hormones. Doing so is unethical medicine, a violation of the bodily integrity of children—whether or not those kids or their parents or doctors are religious.</td>

      <td>Manipulative actors have been known to take advantage of the madness of crowds.</td>
      <td>To figure out if you’re in a bubble, you need to find the source of the hot air. Obvious for  GameStop ,  but for bitcoin, not so much.<br />In July 2018, we wrote about the cryptocurrency company Tether, which issues tokens called tethers that trade under the symbol USDT and should be valued at $1—making the currency a “stablecoin.” Tether’s creators might have manipulated bitcoin, a University of Texas paper suggests, by issuing tokens willy-nilly unbacked by real dollars and then buying bitcoin to jack up its price. (The company claims the research is flawed.)<br />At the time, Tether’s total value was some $2.7 billion, and its website claimed: “Every tether is always backed 1-to-1 by traditional currency held in our reserves.” So somewhere there should have been $2.7 billion in real money—that’s how a stablecoin is supposed to work. In November 2018, New York state Attorney General Letitia James invoked the Martin Act to begin an investigation into iFinex, which owns Tether and the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange, “in connection with ongoing activities that may have defrauded New York investors.” The company has disputed the attorney general’s claims, denied it misled customers, and said it will fight any action. An appellate court last year rejected its challenge to the probe.<br />Bitcoin peaked at the end of 2017 at $19,000 and over the next year collapsed to $3,200. Well—they’re baaack! On Friday Elon Musk was the latest to pump Bitcoin, which briefly reached almost $38,000. And there are now some $26.4 billion of USDT tokens, $18 billion of which were created since March 2020. Why the increase? No one has a good explanation.<br />All that glitters is not gold. In 2019 Tether subtly updated its claim to say reserves “may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties.” Tether has even admitted it only has 74% of the cash or cash equivalents to back its stablecoin. Hmmm. Basically unbacked.</td>

      <td>The proposal comes as Democratic lawmakers prepare to advance the president’s $1.9 trillion plan without Republican support</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A group of Republican senators asked President Biden to work with them on a $600 billion bipartisan coronavirus relief effort as Democrats prepared to move forward on a $1.9 trillion package without GOP support.<br />In a letter Sunday, the 10 centrist Republican senators asked to meet with Mr. Biden to present details of their proposal and said they were coming forward in response to his appeal for bipartisanship.<br />The letter didn’t specify the cost of the proposal. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), one of the Republicans who signed the letter, said on “Fox News Sunday” that the proposal amounts to roughly $600 billion in spending. He also said it would match President Biden’s $160 billion allocation for increasing vaccinations and other efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus.<br />The offer is the first Republicans have forwarded since Mr. Biden proposed the $1.9 trillion plan, which Republicans have said is too costly and includes unneeded initiatives, and tests whether the Biden administration and Democrats in Congress will seek compromise or try to pass the relief package themselves. Democratic leaders have said they plan to begin a legislative process that would bypass the need for Republican support this week, with the first step coming as soon as Monday.<br />Brian Deese, Mr. Biden’s top economic adviser, said Sunday the White House is reviewing the Republicans’ letter and is willing to discuss ways to make the relief package more effective.</td>

That drove U.S. distillers’ revenue up 7.7% to $31.2 billion last year, according to the Distilled Spirits Council—or DISCUS—a trade body. It said the figures marked the fastest growth and highest sales for at least 40 years.<br />“Consumers’ behavior has shifted as a result, in part, of certain things they’re unable to do or not do to the same degree,” said Kathryn Mikells, finance chief of Johnnie Walker maker  Diageo  PLC. “They’re spending more money on food and beverage. They’re interested in treating themselves.”<br />Spirits costing above $40 per 750 milliliters accounted for 40% of the U.S. spirits industry’s growth last year, compared with 34% in 2019, according to DISCUS. High-end liquors are among the most profitable spirits for alcohol makers.</td>

If you have a legitimate safety concern—for example, you were offered a job at a nursing home where there isn’t enough protective equipment for staff—you have some protection under a couple of statutes. But there’s still ambiguity in how states interpret the statutes.<br />That may change soon. President Biden has asked the Labor Department to “consider clarifying” the rules and provide workers “a federally guaranteed right” to refuse a job. Clear guidance from the agency would help states, which administer unemployment benefits, apply the rules fairly and consistently.<br />The Details</td>

Most of the $9.2 billion in subsidies awarded by the Federal Communications Commission was earmarked for more established technologies, which included companies laying fiber-optic cable.<br />The FCC is requiring SpaceX and others in line for subsidies to demonstrate their financial and technical wherewithal to build out a network, and Friday was the deadline for submitting those plans.</td>

He ran some deficits to support infrastructure projects.<br />Now he’s shifting his agenda into a higher gear, marking one of the biggest leftward moves in Canadian federal politics since the mid-1960s, political analysts and historians say, when the Liberal government of the day introduced universal health care and a national pension plan.<br />“We can choose to embrace bold new solutions to the challenges we face and refuse to be held back by old ways of thinking,” Mr. Trudeau said back in August, when he first began making promises about a wider social safety net and more aggressive environmental policy. “This is our chance to build a more resilient Canada.”<br />He appointed a new finance minister, Chrystia Freeland—who steered Canada’s negotiations with the Trump administration on a revamped North American free-trade pact—to oversee development of this new policy road map.</td>

      <td>Much of the climb in solar stocks looks justified by growth prospects, but buyers may still be in for a bumpy ride</td>
      <td>Solar stocks are sizzling—quite an accomplishment for the simplest and most mature of the green-energy technologies. Finding companies that could keep shining might require looking in less obvious places.<br />The MAC Global Solar Energy Index has generated a 233% return including dividends for dollar investors during the past year. That is well ahead of returns from wind-turbine makers  Vestas  and Siemens Gamesa, nevermind the S&P 500’s 15%.<br />As public and political support for green power has broadened, markets have come to expect a decadeslong renewables rollout. It is hard to see any catalyst for a change in sentiment, says Sam Arie, a veteran utilities analyst at UBS. Solar panels can be the cheapest way to generate electricity in many parts of the world. “In some cases it is even cheaper to build a new solar farm than run existing coal plants,” says Alex Monk, a portfolio manager at asset manager  Schroders .<br />The catch is that the shift to renewables doesn’t guarantee shareholder returns. To justify high valuations, investors need to ensure companies have a defensible business as well as growth prospects.<br />Solar investors have already experienced at least two stomach-churning cycles. A key lesson has been that making panels themselves is a low-margin, hypercompetitive market best avoided. But other parts of the value chain offer better prospects.</td>
