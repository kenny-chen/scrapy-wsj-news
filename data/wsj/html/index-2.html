      <td>Proposal to split control of the two agencies before end of Trump administration faces resistance from lawmakers</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Some senior Defense Department officials are pressing to formally separate the leadership of the National Security Agency from U.S. Cyber Command, in an apparent effort to weaken the military’s control of its top electronic spy agency, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The proposal to split control of the two agencies before the end of the Trump administration and install a civilian atop the NSA is already facing resistance from lawmakers in Congress. It also isn’t clear how the separation could legally occur without the administration proving to Congress that certain conditions required under the law have been met, the people said.<br />The move, which has been considered by officials in years past, is controversial because it could lead to the politicization of intelligence produced by the NSA, one of the primary feeders of highly sensitive information to the nation’s military. It also would amount to a sweeping bureaucratic restructuring of intelligence and cybersecurity agencies amid a change in administrations.<br />The plan under consideration was circulated among Pentagon officials in recent days, according to a U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter. It is supported by Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, who was installed at the Pentagon in early November. The plan appears to be a dusted-off version of one that was first floated inside the Pentagon by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, according to another U.S. official. “This is very preliminary,” the official said, adding that a meeting was scheduled for this coming week to discuss the proposal.</td>

      <td>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Russia for the  SolarWinds  hack that compromised numerous federal agencies and U.S. corporations, while President Trump said he was skeptical of a growing consensus in Washington about the country’s role.<br />“This was a very significant effort, and I think it’s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,” Mr. Pompeo said in a Friday night interview with radio host Mark Levin.<br />The remarks made him the first Trump administration official to explicitly say Russia was responsible for the breach, which officials have said is one of the worst intelligence failures on record.<br />Mr. Trump in Saturday tweets played down the link to Russia, as well as the severity of the breach, differing with his top diplomat, who has been a loyal ally.<br />“The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. “Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens,” Mr. Trump said, adding there was the “possibility that it may be China (it may!)”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—In a week that began with the Electoral College affirming Joe Biden’s victory and ended with Vice President Mike Pence taking a new Covid-19 vaccine, with a massive national security breach in between, President Trump has been largely out of sight.<br />Instead, six weeks after the election, the president remains fixated on his unsuccessful efforts to overturn the results, advisers say. He pays close attention to TV coverage of state hearings on alleged election fraud though no evidence of widespread fraud has surfaced, and in tweets and phone calls has urged his advisers and lawyers to keep going.<br />In early Saturday tweets, Mr. Trump chided fellow Republicans, “Don’t be weak fools!” and urged them to join a protest in Washington next month.<br />“He’s still in the fight-for-every-vote mode,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a Trump loyalist, who this week acknowledged Mr. Biden’s victory and said the president’s path to overturning the results is “very, very narrow.”<br />An administration official described the president’s strategy to overturn the election results as: “Let’s throw a giant plate of spaghetti at the wall and hope that at least one noodle sticks.”</td>

The previous deadline had been 12:01 a.m. Saturday.<br />Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said lawmakers were still negotiating Saturday over the last stumbling block: a push from Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) to restrict the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending powers.<br />“Sen. Toomey’s legislation creates barriers to emergency lending that go far beyond current law,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor Saturday. “It’s about tying the hands of the next Treasury secretary and the next Fed chairman in a true emergency.”<br />Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Democratic leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had productive discussions all week and urged lawmakers to conclude their negotiations. He didn’t specifically discuss the Toomey proposal.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The U.K. imposed a fresh lockdown across London and surrounding areas of England to combat a new strain of Covid-19 that appears to be significantly more contagious than earlier variants of the pathogen.<br />Scientists say the new variant might be as much as 70% more transmissible than more established strains, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at a news conference Saturday. Though it spreads more easily from person to person, there is no evidence it is any more deadly or resistant to vaccines, he said.<br />The new lockdown means many families won’t be allowed to gather for Christmas. Mr. Johnson, who only days ago noted it would be “inhuman” to put curbs on Christmas celebration, said: “It is with a very heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned.”<br />The new restrictions cover the capital, as well as much of southeastern and eastern England. In London, the new strain of the virus accounted for 62% of the new cases identified in the week through Wednesday.<br />Similar steps have been taken across Europe to beat back rising caseloads. In Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced Friday a total lockdown across the country for the first time since May to be in force over Christmas, from Dec. 24 until Jan. 6.</td>

      <td>PARIS—French officials have brought preliminary charges, including raping minors, against an associate of the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.<br />French prosecutors alleged Saturday that modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel raped minors over the age of 15 and committed acts of sexual harassment. Mr. Brunel is also being questioned, though not charged, on suspicion of child sex trafficking, prosecutors said. He will remain in custody pending further investigation, the prosecutors added.<br />A lawyer for Mr. Brunel, Corinne Dreyfus-Schmidt, didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Preliminary charges are an important step in the French judicial process that indicates authorities are deepening an investigation. Mr. Brunel is now under the authority of three investigating magistrates, who will work with police to gather evidence to determine whether—and on what formal charges—Mr. Brunel should stand trial.<br />Mr. Brunel was detained this week as he attempted to board a flight to Senegal from Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport, part of a nearly year-and-a-half investigation into allegations of underage rape and sex trafficking committed in France or against French people by Epstein and his accomplices, prosecutors said.</td>

      <td>In many times and places, the joyful holiday has been a time for melancholy reflections and ghostly visitations.</td>
      <td>In this pandemic year, many of us will be celebrating Christmas under the shadow of grief and uncertainty. But Christmas, like the pagan winter festivals that preceded it, has always carried more than a hint of darkness. The joyous celebration of the birth of the Christian savior has often been an occasion for melancholy and nostalgia, particularly when families are separated by war or other tragic events.<br />In November 1863, during the Civil War, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s son Charles was seriously wounded in battle. A few weeks later on Christmas, Longfellow wrote “I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,” reflecting on how the carnage “mocks” the holiday’s promise of “peace on earth, good-will to men.” In 1943, Bing Crosby’s recording of the song “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” spoke to millions of soldiers and their families who couldn’t celebrate the holiday together: “I’ll be home for Christmas/If only in my dreams.” And in 1967, as war raged in Vietnam, Stevie Wonder’s “Someday at Christmas” looked forward, like Longfellow’s poem, to a happier future: “Someday at Christmas there’ll be no wars/When we have learned what Christmas is for.”<br />Christmas melancholy often takes a ghostly form. In the 19th century, telling ghost stories on Christmas Eve was popular in Britain and North America, a tradition that inspired many writers to create their own. The narrator of Henry James’s psychological horror story “The Turn of the Screw” calls it “gruesome, as, on Christmas Eve in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be.” Charles Dickens wrote a series of ghost stories published yearly at Christmas. “A Christmas Carol” is the most famous, but there were many others, including “The Signalman,” in which a railway worker receives spectral warnings of impending accidents. In the 20th century, continuing the tradition, Christmas has been a popular setting for horror movies, such as “Black Christmas” (1974) and “Krampus” (2015), which draws on German folklore about a demonic anti-Santa Claus who eats naughty children.<br />Many cultures have similar traditions about a Christmas visitor who punishes bad children, rather than bringing presents to good ones. In France, Père Fouettard (“Father Whipper”) is said to beat badly behaved children with a whip. On Christmas Eve in South Africa, homes may be haunted by Danny, a boy who was beaten to death by his grandmother for eating cookies left out for Santa.<br />Italy’s La Befana is more sad than scary. When the Christ child was born, she was invited by the three Magi to join them on the journey to Bethlehem, but she declined because she was too busy tending her house. She soon regretted her decision and went out to look for the wise men, but they were already gone. Ever since, on the Feast of the Epiphany—the holiday in early January that commemorates the visit of the Magi—she travels the world in search of the infant Jesus, leaving gifts for children wherever she stops.</td>

The firm invests in startups that are tackling problems faced by low-income communities around the world, providing seed money to companies such as PEG Africa, which provides solar home systems on credit to off-grid households across West Africa.</td>

Here are five areas likely to affect nearly all Americans, tech topics the incoming administration and its advisers have indicated will take precedence.<br />Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act is the legal principle that makes today’s internet possible—from  Facebook ,   Twitter  and TikTok to YouTube, Discord and Twitch. It protects companies from being held liable for what their users do online.<br />This made sense when online services were little more than tools for creating virtual billboards and mailing lists, but many of today’s platforms have evolved to include powerful artificial-intelligence algorithms that determine what shows up in people’s feeds. Critics on both sides of the political aisle say if companies control what people see, they should be responsible for what people see—and don’t see.<br />President Trump threatened to veto a recent defense-spending bill unless a provision to strike down Section 230 was included. Last December, Mr. Biden declared that Section 230 should be “revoked, immediately.”</td>

      <td>We know now that as Wall Street analysts were publishing their 2020 forecasts the virus that would upend them all was already spreading in Wuhan, China. Jonathan Golub was particularly unlucky: On Jan. 21, Mr. Golub, Credit Suisse’s chief U.S. equity strategist, upgraded his prediction for the S&P 500 to end the year at 3600.<br />Discounting the threat of Covid-19 that day was an easy mistake to make, and one I made too. But imagine he had spotted the epidemiological consequences, and correctly recognized that the economy would plunge into the deepest recession in centuries. Surely no one would have concluded that his bullish S&P forecast was way too cautious, and the S&P would be more than 100 points higher than he expected by December?<br />“We thought there was no environment that could be worse than 2008-9,” Mr. Golub says. “This [2020] made the Great Financial Crisis look like an appetizer. And yet the market did so well.”<br />Dozens of investors and bank strategists put out public prognostications for what would happen in the markets, but 2020’s combination was so unusual it was missed by everyone, so far as I can tell: a far weaker economy, far weaker earnings, but significantly higher stock prices, at least in the U.S.<br />By their nature, once-in-100-year events are hard to predict. But the real lesson of 2020 is that even correctly predicting fundamentals just isn’t enough. What mattered this year wasn’t earnings, but the speed and scale of the response by central banks and governments, alongside a recognition that the U.S. stock market doesn’t reflect the economy.</td>

The U.S. this week formally removed Sudan from its list of state-sponsors of terrorism, paving the way for the Northeast African nation to request help from the IMF and the World Bank and ensuring U.S. companies will have an easier time doing business in the country, Gabriele Steinhauser and Nicholas Bariyo report. The Trump White House promised to revoke the designation as part of a deal to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel.<br />In agreeing to the deal, the White House also said it would help reduce Sudan’s debt burden, which has swollen to $60 billion, or 200% of gross domestic product. Sudanese officials said Washington pledged tens of millions of dollars in direct support for its economy, which is struggling with annual inflation above 200%. This week, the U.S. Agency for International Development said it provided 65,000 metric tons of wheat to Sudan worth $20 million.<br />As well as agreeing to normalize ties with Israel, Sudan had to agree to pay $335 million for compensation to U.S. victims of the terrorist attacks, following several years of talks between Washington and Khartoum.<br />Mass kidnapping highlights failure of Nigeria’s fight against extremists. The kidnapping last Friday night of more than 300 boys from a boarding school in northwest Nigeria has shone a harsh light on the country’s government’s efforts to combat terrorism. Jihadist group Boko Haram said on Tuesday it had seized students from an all-boys school in Katsina—home town of President Muhammadu Buhari—to punish them for “un-Islamic practices.” Local officials said that 333 of the school’s 800 students were missing and assumed captive.</td>

      <td>NEW DELHI— Wistron Corp.  apologized for mishandling wages at its plant in India that makes iPhones, saying it will correct the problems that led a group of angry workers to damage its facilities a week ago.<br />On Dec. 12, workers broke windows and overturned cars at a Wistron facility near India’s technology hub of Bangalore. They threw stones, tossed office furniture and set fire to a sign at Wistron’s operations, according to videos shown on Indian television.<br />Labor leaders said workers at the Taiwanese-owned company that is a contract manufacturer for  Apple Inc.  were upset about late wage payments and confusion over expected working hours and overtime payments.<br />Wistron has investigated and discovered the workers had legitimate complaints, said Wistron spokeswoman Joyce Chou. To try to fix the problems it has removed the vice president who oversees its business in India and started an anonymous hot-line for complaints and created other avenues for employees to disclose their concerns.<br />“We deeply regret this and apologize to all of our workers,” Ms. Chou said.  “This is a new facility, and we recognize that we made mistakes as we expanded. Some of the processes we put in place to manage labor agencies and payments need to be strengthened and upgraded.”</td>

Some Republicans on the panel who are likely to ask tough questions, including Sens. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R., Texas), have had presidential ambitions in recent years.<br />Foreign-policy experts say Mr. Blinken is unlikely to reveal many details of the early efforts to formulate the detailed policies of the new administration.</td>

Brazil, with the second-highest number of official Covid-19 deaths after the U.S., registered record rates of new infections in recent days. Parts of Peru are seeing testing positivity rates of nearly 100%.<br />Latin America, with more deaths per capita during the pandemic than any other region, is suffering from a second surge of Covid-19, ending a period of several months where cases and deaths declined. The surge is particularly acute in the region’s two biggest countries, Mexico and Brazil.<br />Daily deaths in Brazil topped 1,000 on Thursday for the first day since September, and the country posted roughly 70,000 new daily infections on Wednesday and Thursday, a record. In Mexico, the daily death toll has doubled to about 600 a day from about 320 in mid-October.<br />“We urgently need to bend the curve of contagion,” said Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico City’s mayor, this week. Health authorities ordered the closure of nonessential businesses such as restaurants and shopping malls from Saturday until Jan. 10 across the capital and surrounding municipalities, home to some 22 million people.<br />Cases are rising quickly in Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Chile, and even in Uruguay and Paraguay, two nations that had escaped relatively unharmed from the pandemic.</td>

This year, his choice was Switzerland or Switzerland.<br />All other countries around the Alps are closed for ski tourism because of the Covid-19 pandemic, so the 46-year-old from Vienna, Austria, got up at 3 a.m. on a recent morning and drove eight hours with his girlfriend to reach this upscale Swiss resort. The couple stayed in a hotel and avoided crowds while skiing.<br />“I thought this out. I didn’t just get in the car and start driving,” said Mr. Pototschnig, who works in advertising and made the ski weekend his girlfriend’s Christmas gift. “Skiing can be safe if you avoid the partying,” he said.<br />On a recent morning, cars parked near one of St. Moritz’s main lift stations sported license plates from Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Slovenia and Poland.<br />Switzerland is holding out against pressure from other European countries to shut down its ski lifts, even though the country is struggling with one of Europe’s highest Covid-19 infection rates. Like elsewhere in Europe, anti-contagion measures punctuate Swiss daily life: Face masks are obligatory almost everywhere, large gatherings are banned, and restaurants and bars have limited hours. But Swiss authorities say skiing is safe.</td>

      <td>The show, streaming now on HBO Max, reveals the many unwritten rules of dressing for success in investment banking for both men and women</td>
      <td>THE FIRST rule of dressing for a finance career: Never let them see you sweat. When you’re facing clients in that high-stakes world, a good suit and a fresh shirt convey coolness and calm even when you’re privately perspiring in your crevices. On the HBO show “Industry,” bankers have tricks to keep their fluids in check while they transfer ungodly amounts of money with one click: getting a just-pressed shirt delivered to their desks; popping a sporty “Midtown Uniform” vest over it to conceal underarm stains; keeping Kiehl’s facial mist within arm’s reach. This kind of granular detail pervades nearly every scene of the first season of the series, a look at how young people navigate their stressful, sweaty lives at Pierpoint & Co., a fictional investment bank in London.<br />The show examines how new recruits from different backgrounds try to crack the notoriously white, male, upper-class banking profession. Mastering the balance between fitting in and showing off is crucial, and fashion is key to that formula.<br />At first glance, the clothes on “Industry” look incredibly boring, which is the point. While none of the many real financiers I spoke with wished to be identified due to office confidentiality policies, all found the show’s costume design dead on, or, as one put it, “eerily accurate.” That’s to be expected: Right out of Oxford, the show’s early-30s co-creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay worked at  Rothschild  & Co. and  Morgan Stanley ,  respectively. While you might initially dismiss the show’s style as a flat reflection of corporate banality, the barely perceptible details of the characters’ clothing speak volumes.<br />“Everyone is blending in, but in these very subtle ways, they’re showing their power,” said Mr. Down, who told me that he and his co-creator are “obsessed with clothes” themselves. “It’s a very subtle and interesting way of telling a story and revealing character,” he continued.<br />The pair wrote nearly every single costume into the show, right down to the pieces’ brands. So when the character Yasmin (played by Marisa Abela) is lounging casually at home, she’s not just wearing any old jeans and sneakers. According to the script, her outfit comprises “lick-the-sole-new Common Projects, Acne Jeans, baby-cash Loro Piana polo neck.”</td>

From phonographs in living rooms and radios near battlefields, the words to “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” comforted mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, soldiers alone in the dark.</td>

      <td>A Whitney Museum exhibition spotlights the Pakistani-American artist, whose deft depictions of young gay men signal hope for the future of figurative painting.</td>
      <td>A good many figurative paintings these days seem to aspire to being cover illustrations for the New Yorker magazine. They have the kind of benign, politely progressive, op-ed flavor that hardly any educated urbanite can resist—a perfect match for the magazine’s covers, which have evolved over the decades from pictures of tweedy, upper-middle-class pleasures to, for lack of a better term, a persistent social conscience.<br />That’s not a bad thing, for either the periodical (as a subscriber, I await each week’s punchy premier pictorial), or today’s figurative painting—at least when it’s not strident, self-congratulatory, or mawkish. The work of Salman Toor—a Pakistani-American painter born in 1983 who depicts the lives of (in the words of the Whitney Museum of American Art’s press materials) “young, queer Brown men residing between New York City and South Asia”—is an exception to these debilities. Mr. Toor’s work is modestly original, deftly done, poignant, and—by its very existence and the Whitney’s giving it museum exposure in the free, ground-floor lobby gallery—evidence of hope for imperfect humanity.<br />“Salman Toor: How Will I Know,” a show of 15 oil paintings ranging in size from a little over a foot to more than four feet on a side, depicts young gay men—Mr. Toor and his friends—at home in groups and in pairs, in clubs, intimately alone, and, occasionally, in perilous situations with the police. The exhibition is Mr. Toor’s first museum solo show.<br />Mr. Toor can certainly draw. According to a Whitney website essay, the artist “spent years studiously poring over and copying the works of Rococo, Baroque, and Neoclassical-era artists like Caravaggio, Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, and Jean-Antoine Watteau, incorporating their styles into his own original compositions.” He obviously picked up what he needed to know there, and along the way added some semi-cartoonish aspects to his ultimately brushy painting style. He includes, for example, the comic-strip visual trope of light lines to show the glow of a computer screen. There’s considerable Daumier, and—Mr. Toor attended college in the U.S.—maybe even a little R. Crumb in his pictures. Mr. Toor’s people, with their Pinocchio noses, also look somewhat like marionettes. His work depicts, in part, the inherent tragedy of gay life in places where governments prosecute it, and also adds a faint tension to scenes of nominally comfy domesticity.<br />What’s most powerful in lending Mr. Toor’s paintings their emotive combination of fleeting, gossamer happiness and a semi-numbing societal oppression is his palette. His paintings range from those that are mostly neutrals (i.e., the colorlessness of getting by day-to-day) to those with large areas of turquoise (Mr. Toor has called green “a space of self”), with punctuations of rust red and tangerine. He gives a sense of atmosphere to otherwise flat backgrounds by articulating them with small patches of color.</td>

      <td>Congress considers countermanding Treasury with  tax benefits worth hundreds of billions of dollars for business owners</td>
      <td><br />WASHINGTON—Congress may be poised to deliver a tax benefit worth hundreds of billions of dollars to business owners who took Paycheck Protection Program loans.<br />The provision, part of the discussions over the year-end coronavirus relief bill, would ensure that PPP recipients can deduct the payroll costs and other expenses covered by forgiven loans, even though the loans themselves are tax-free income. The move would reverse a Treasury Department ruling that denied the deductions.<br />Lawmakers say they just want to clarify what Congress intended to do when it created the PPP and prevent unexpected tax bills from hitting business owners. Still, a full deduction could reduce federal revenue by about $200 billion, with a majority going to very high-income households, according to Adam Looney of the Brookings Institution, who is a former Obama administration official.<br />There is bipartisan agreement in Congress to overturn the Treasury decision that denied deductions and frustrated business owners. Some progressive groups and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued that the combination of tax-free income and deductible expenses amounted to double dipping, but the lobbying clout of business groups and senior lawmakers in both parties is countering that view.</td>

      <td>Perhaps the most influential executive at Google is a man who can’t write a line of code.<br />That is Kent Walker, the company’s chief legal officer and head of global affairs, whose role puts him at the center of the search giant’s antitrust challenges. It also gives him the power to lead the defense that will determine whether one of the world’s dominant conglomerates is able to keep growing—or gets clipped.<br />Google faces formidable legal challenges. Its parent,  Alphabet Inc.,  was sued by federal prosecutors in October for allegedly abusing monopoly power in its flagship search engine, and this week state attorneys general added their own pair of lawsuits targeting digital advertising, among other areas. Google broadly denies the claims and says it will contest them in court.<br />While some of the specific allegations are new, Google’s use of its power has been under scrutiny for at least a decade. Under Mr. Walker, who became chief legal officer in 2018, it has fended off inquiries in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, Italy, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and the U.K. without sustaining a meaningful blow. The European Union made the biggest splash, levying total fines of more than $10 billion, but since the first of the EU’s three decisions against Google landed in 2017, the company’s revenue and stock price have shot up by about half.<br />Mr. Walker, a 14-year company veteran, has long favored providing regulators with reams of data and paperwork, according to current and former employees, yet those tactics might be wearing thin.</td>

Moderna shares rose 5.1% Thursday when an advisory panel cleared the way for Friday night’s authorization.<br />Exxon is going green(ish). The Texas-based oil giant pledged Monday to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations over the next five years and eliminate routine flaring, or burning, of methane from its oil-and-gas operations in the next decade. “We respect and support society’s ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and continue to advocate for policies that promote cost-effective, market-based solutions to address the risks of climate change,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said. The targets stop short of pledges by European peers, including BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC to reach net-zero carbon emissions—efforts Mr. Woods previously called a “beauty competition.” Exxon shares fell 3.6% Monday.<br />Ten states sued Google Wednesday, accusing the search giant of running an illegal digital-advertising monopoly and enlisting rival  Facebook Inc.  in an alleged deal to rig ad auctions. The following day, 38 states joined in an antitrust lawsuit that alleged the Alphabet Inc. unit maintained monopoly power over the internet-search market through anticompetitive contracts and conduct. Thursday’s suit asks the court to move to prevent Google from harming competition, “including but not limited to structural divestitures.” The Justice Department filed a similar suit Oct. 20. Alphabet shares fell 0.9% Thursday.<br />Boeing is taking a closer look at some of its 787s. The plane maker has expanded inspections of newly produced Dreamliners after finding more manufacturing defects., holding up deliveries. These delays threaten to add to Boeing’s financial strain as it struggles with fallout from the pandemic, which has sapped global demand for air travel and passenger jets. The wide-body Dreamliner passenger jets, which Boeing first delivered in 2011, have an excellent safety record, but the latest defects mark the fourth assembly-line lapse in recent months. Delivery data shows that November was the only month since 2013 without a Dreamliner delivery, other than May, when the pandemic forced Boeing to briefly close production facilities. Boeing shares fell 0.7% Monday.<br /></td>

Here’s what we know and don’t know.<br />The FDA authorized the vaccine to be administered to people 18 years and older to prevent Covid-19.<br />FDA staff reviewed data that Moderna provided to the agency from a clinical trial testing the company’s vaccine in about 30,000 people. FDA staff concluded the vaccine was highly effective at protecting against Covid-19 with symptoms, with no specific safety concerns that would preclude authorization. The FDA also considered the input from a committee of outside advisers, which voted Thursday 20 to 0, with one abstention, that the vaccine’s benefits outweighed its risks.<br />Within days. Moderna has been making doses of the vaccine so it would have supplies to ship if the FDA granted permission. Federal health officials have said shipments could start within 24 hours of authorization, which would mean hospitals and other vaccination sites get doses as early as Monday.<br />Vaccinations could start within a day or two of Moderna’s shipments, yet initial supplies will be very limited. Initially, about six million doses will be distributed. Moderna says it expects to have 20 million doses ready to ship by the end of the year, enough supply of the two-dose shot for 10 million people. Given such limited initial supplies of both Moderna’s vaccine and one from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech  SE, authorities are expected to prioritize shots for people at the highest risk of Covid-19, like doctors and nurses on the front lines of treating coronavirus patients, and residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities.</td>

We know China was enraged when Mr. Lai met with American politicians on trips to Washington in 2019, including Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the basis of the national security charge is that he’s encouraged foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and Beijing.<br />Mr. Lai has been denied bail and publicly exhibited in shackles. Ta Kung Pao, the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece in Hong Kong, says he should be extradited to the mainland for trial. Friends worry that would be a death sentence for the 72-year-old publisher.<br />President Xi Jinping is hoping to intimidate Hong Kongers into silence and testing whether Mr. Biden and his aides will look the other way at these and other abuses. So far Mr. Xi must be pleased at the lack of response.<br />One of the Trump Administration’s achievements was to recognize that China has become America’s primary adversary. It steals U.S. technology, monitors and intimidates critics on American university campuses, engages in massive spying, claims new territory in the South China Sea, and threatens U.S. allies in Taiwan and Australia. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has pushed back, from condemning China’s incarceration of the Uighurs to sanctioning officials responsible for the crackdown in Hong Kong.</td>

That’s essentially what a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court said Friday in dismissing a legal challenge (Trump v. New York) by Democratic states for lack of standing.<br />“A foundational principle of Article III is that ‘an actual controversy must exist not only at the time the complaint is filed, but through all stages of the litigation,’” the Court noted in an unsigned ruling with Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor dissenting.<br />Democratic states claimed they would lose federal funding and Congressional seats if the President’s order was implemented, though these harms are speculative. President Trump’s order directed the Commerce Secretary to gather information “to the extent practicable” and exclude undocumented aliens “to the extent feasible.”<br />The Justice Department conceded during oral arguments this month that the government lacked records on many of the 10.5 million or so undocumented immigrants in the country. It was also unclear whether the Census Bureau could even mesh the records in its possession with the decennial enumeration.<br />In other words, the order might not even be implemented, let alone harm Democratic states. “At present, this case is riddled with contingencies and speculation that impede judicial review,” the Court noted.</td>

      <td>You know a security breach is bad when no one in government wants to talk about it. That appears to be the case with what is being called a Russian cyber attack on at least six U.S. cabinet-level departments that has come to light in the last week.<br />U.S. officials briefed on the breach are telling reporters that it appears to have begun when hackers broke into the systems of  SolarWinds Corp. , a private company that contracts with U.S. agencies, defense contractors and other corporations. SolarWinds isn’t saying much, and neither are the feds.<br />But reports say the departments of State, Treasury, Homeland Security, Energy, Commerce and the National Institutes of Health were compromised. These agencies contain countless secrets and data that could be useful to an adversary. The Energy Department supervises many of America’s nuclear weapons facilities, and Treasury monitors global terror financing.<br />Some reports say no classified information was compromised, but more disconcerting is that no one seems to know for sure. U.S. officials still don’t know the extent of the cyber breach, how long the hackers have had access to U.S. systems, or how they were able to go undetected for so long. The U.S. has spent tens of billions on cyber defenses in a project known as Einstein, yet it appears to have been the cyber equivalent of France’s Maginot Line on the German border in 1940.<br />President Trump has said nothing, which is not his habit.

      <td>Why the ‘iron apparatus’ of the scientific method counts for more than any single genius.</td>
      <td>Among the missed opportunities in my life, the elaborate physics kit my parents gave me for my 10th birthday reigns supreme. Intimidated by the sheer number of parts, I never performed any of the experiments, but I remember being mightily pleased with the manual that came with it, a spiral-bound paean to the rigors of scientific tinkering.<br />Memories of that pleasure came flooding back to me as I was reading Michael Strevens’s riveting book “The Knowledge Machine.” A philosopher of science at New York University, Mr. Strevens doesn’t hide his light under a bushel. “In this book,” he tells us, “you will discover how science really works.” Forget those flashes of serendipitous insight that you were told precede scientific discovery, the magical dream in which the periodic table appeared to Dmitri Mendeleev, or the mysterious fluorescent glow Wilhelm Röntgen beheld in his cathode tube that led to the development of the X-ray. Post-Newtonian science, for Mr. Strevens, is all about measurements and their gradual experimental refinement; it is, as he informs us with grim delight, inhuman, repetitive and sterile, an insensible machine bent solely on the production of facts about the observable world. What keeps it running is the “iron rule of explanation,” a firm set of standards by which all scientists are expected to abide. Those standards decide what counts as evidence and what doesn’t: They sift the wheat of truth from the chaff of falsehoods and control who comes out on top (and, if very lucky, bags a Nobel Prize). The knowledge machine doesn’t need dreams or magic to function. And, as Mr. Strevens admits, it doesn’t need a philosopher of science either.<br />Undaunted, Mr. Strevens promises his readers a better explanation of scientific progress than those given by his two illustrious predecessors, Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn. Where Popper envisioned scientific truth rising from a “mass extermination of hypotheses,” Kuhn saw it happening through paradigm changes by which a new way of scientific thinking creeps up on and eventually obliterates another, older, exhausted one. Mr. Strevens’s machine, by contrast, isn’t driven by revolutions or falsification efforts. Like the deadly apparatus in Kafka’s famous story “In the Penal Colony,” it works slowly, indifferently, oblivious to the world around it. Supremely self-sufficient, it is immune to the potshots of the “radical subjectivists,” those humanists or sociologists, disdained by Mr. Strevens, who believe that science has no special claim to objectivity. While the results of the machine’s work are open to debate, the machine itself is not; it is that stubborn imperviousness that, to the outside observer, seems “irrational.”<br />Mr. Strevens sustains his polemical fireworks with a steady succession of examples drawn from the history of science. A clear favorite among those is the observational test of Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity that was initiated, a century ago, by British astronomers Frank Watson Dyson and Arthur Eddington. Hoping to measure what Einstein had predicted, the deflection, or bending, of light by the sun’s gravitational field, Eddington dispatched his teams to photograph a total solar eclipse on the island of Príncipe off the coast of West Africa and in Sobral in northern Brazil. Things did not go smoothly. Heavy clouds made all but two of the Príncipe plates unusable, and the larger of the two telescopes in Sobral yielded only blurry results. But, eager to patch up what World War I had torn asunder, Eddington declared the venture a success and the German-born Einstein vindicated. His official account of the experiment, deferring to the “iron rule,” makes no mention of his personal motivations. Eddington’s experiment, still being debated today, must be judged (and Mr. Strevens shows us how) on the plausibility of the published assumptions and the strength of the data it delivers, without regard to what had happened behind the scenes.<br />When left to its own devices, science will advance and eventually save us from ourselves. Or so Mr. Strevens assures us in his final, pandemic-inflected chapter. But it’s awfully hard to keep the noisy world at bay. Even Eddington’s report is not as anodyne as one might expect. Tucked in between tables dense with measurements, we get fulsome praise for the beautiful scenery on Príncipe as well as hints at the difficulties Eddington’s men encountered, including the Royal Observatory carpenter who couldn’t help because he was still in the military, the steamship company that went on strike, and the ice that wasn’t available when the negatives had to be developed. Did Eddington merely neglect to clean up his writing? Or did he let those details stand because they reinforce his view, expressed at the end of the article, that his experiments should be repeated, presumably with even better results, “at future eclipses”?</td>

      <td>Sportswear giant reports higher profit and revenue, boosted by China and 84% jump in digital sales</td>
      <td>Nike Inc.’s  pivot to e-commerce has helped the sneaker giant power through the coronavirus pandemic.<br />On Friday, the company said its flagship brand’s digital revenue increased 84% in the quarter ended Nov. 30, which included Black Friday. The strong sales from Nike’s websites and mobile apps—along with strong demand in China—helped the company log overall sales gains and higher profits than the year-ago period.<br />“These are times when strong brands get stronger,” Chief Executive John Donahoe said on a conference call. He said the latest results reflect the strength of Nike’s strategy and that he was optimistic about the Covid-19 vaccine.<br />Nike is among several retailers that have benefited from earlier efforts to capture online sales. Before the pandemic hit, the sportswear giant had been beefing up its direct-to-consumer business through its own website and stores. It pared back the number of wholesale stores that could sell its goods and parted ways with  Amazon.com Inc.  last year. It also had been investing in apps for shopping, selling sneakers and guided workouts.<br />In the early months of the pandemic, Nike closed stores and continued to pay its workers, but doubled down on digital sales while consumers were confined to their homes. On Friday, the company said more than 90% of its owned stores were open during the quarter, but they continued to experience declines in traffic due to the pandemic and safety-related measures.</td>

      <td>A proposed wealth tax would apply for a decade to anyone who spends 60 days in the state in a single year.</td>
      <td>California’s Legislature is considering a wealth tax on residents, part-year residents, and any person who spends more than 60 days inside the state’s borders in a single year. Even those who move out of state would continue to be subject to the tax for a decade—a provision that calls to mind the Eagles’ famous “Hotel California” lyric: “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.”<br />The California Constitution probably allows a statewide wealth tax on residents, but any effort to create a tax capable of reaching across state borders is likely to run afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Taxing someone who spends only 60 days in the state in any single year—and extending that tax over an ensuing decade—would be something new under the sun.<br />Each year this tax net would gather up a new crop of taxpayers for the next decade. The range of people it proposes to ensnare is staggering: every student attending college in California, anyone having a major medical procedure at a California hospital and needing an extended in-state recovery period, and those who spend two months in California away from New York or London winters. Under California tax law, there is no distinction between a nonresident from Minnesota and a nonresident from Dubai.<br />Assembly Bill 2088 proposes calculating the wealth tax based on current world-wide net worth each Dec. 31. For part-year and temporary residents, the tax would be proportionate based on their number of days in California. The annual tax would be on current net worth and therefore would include wealth earned, inherited or obtained through gifts or estates long before and long after leaving the state.<br />The proposed wealth tax would fall on a star high-school or college athlete who grows up in California but becomes a wealthy professional in another state after graduation. It would grab a scientist who develops a drug to cure cancer years after leaving California. A grandchild who spent a single summer surfing in Southern California would be subject to the tax. It would include anyone returning home to a foreign country after 60 days in California.</td>

      <td>Green pork will do less good than getting out of the way for energy technology and investment.</td>
      <td>Find a spot on your refrigerator for a quote Vice President-elect Kamala Harris made shortly before the election. “Do you believe climate change is happening and threatening the air we breathe and the water that we drink?” That is, having invoked the sacred term, she proceeded to evince zero understanding of what the issue is all about. Her careless rhetoric is more representative than you might think.<br />Let’s understand: In the long run, a human impact on climate change will be determined by two things—how much warming CO2 causes and how much CO2 is emitted. The United Nations climate panel consults two dozen models to forecast that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 would eventually boost temperatures by 2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The panel aggregates the results of so many models because its scientists can’t empirically verify any of them.<br />On future emissions, it has long been understood that human carbon output has been growing at roughly half the RCP 8.5 rate cited in universally adopted worst-case scenarios. Credit goes to large economic and demographic trends: richer societies, smaller families, more-service-based economies. A U.N. working document expects these trends to unfold regardless of whether governments enact policies specifically “to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a goal in itself.”<br />Policy ideas nevertheless leap to mind that would enhance these dynamics. Unfortunately, after 30 years, climate policy as practiced in the advanced economies has been overtaken by what the economist Bruce Yandle calls Baptist-and-bootlegger incentives. Policy formation has been captured by those with a financial stake in green subsidies irrespective of any climate benefit.<br />Which brings us to the Joe Biden administration. Look at the dutiful drudges he’s putting in charge: John Kerry, former Obama EPA chief Gina McCarthy, former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm. These people, above all, are reliable: They can be trusted not to say that electric cars are a distraction and bauble for the upper middle classes, that nuclear power is essential, that heavy-handed regulation will kill more jobs than it creates, that a carbon tax would be a far more efficient way to discourage emissions than the green socialism Democrats have embraced.</td>

      <td>In the fight to control Covid-19, public fears and policymakers’ hubris make a powerful combination.</td>
      <td>It’s easy to lament, as Nicholas Christakis does several times in “Apollo’s Arrow: The Profound and Enduring Impact of Coronavirus on the Way We Live” (Little, Brown Spark, 368 pages, $29), how quickly the Covid-19 pandemic was “politicized.” But politics is fundamentally about how people live peaceably with each other. Any corporate response to a disease involves power and compulsion and is, by definition, political.<br />Dr. Christakis, a physician and professor of sociology at Yale University’s Human Nature Lab, chronicles the molecular origins of the new coronavirus and the governmental and societal responses to it in the U.S. “Apollo’s Arrow” is a capably written and impressively argued book.<br />Dr. Christakis rejects the belief, held by a substantial minority of Americans, that the U.S. public response to the virus was overwrought and foolish. “I share the view of many good scientists,” he writes, “that vastly more Americans would have died—perhaps a million—had we failed to deploy the resources we marshaled, belatedly, in the spring of 2020.” By “the resources we marshaled” I assume he doesn’t primarily mean masks and social distancing but the lockdowns and school closures that have brought about so much economic destruction, loneliness, depression and social discord. Dr. Christakis acknowledges these as costs, but he treats them as basically necessary. I’m not sure. The argument that things would have been much worse if we hadn’t done what we did—like many such retroactive justifications for disastrous government policies—is conveniently self-exculpatory and unfalsifiable.<br />I mean no disrespect to the author when I suggest that public-health experts, particularly the highly accomplished ones who are employed by elite universities, don’t seem to understand American culture all that well. “It’s only when you can test, trace, and isolate,” he writes, “that you can break the chains of transmission and bring a virus under control.” That is no doubt factually true, but contact tracing and isolation—and by the latter term he doesn’t only mean self-isolation—require the kind of coercive governmental measures that East Asian countries mostly permit and the U.S. Constitution mostly does not. An immense, decentralized nation like the United States, whose citizens jealously guard their personal liberties and often feel no obligation to comply with the dictates of bureaucrats, was always going to do a lousy job of breaking the “chains of transmission.”<br />It’s easy to forget, reading Dr. Christakis’s confident pronouncements, that public-health “experts” have never encountered anything like the Covid-19 pandemic. Expertise is conferred by experience, but who had experienced a pandemic in which actual case numbers dwarf confirmed case numbers, in which asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people have strong disincentives to get tested, and in which the young are, or at least appear to be, far less vulnerable than the old? The correct answer is no one. But that doesn’t stop Dr. Christakis from sounding like a disappointed tutor. “If the country were a student in one of my courses,” he writes in a revealing sentence, “I would not hesitate to hand it an F.”</td>

      <td>From solitary suffering to madness in company, Zadie Smith traces the pandemic’s marks on the human heart.</td>
      <td>It is rare, in the midst of an experience, to become conscious of it as such—as a thing that will shape us, mark us, mean something. Usually we are too caught up in the current; we have to climb up on the bank and dry off before we can begin to see that the experience—just then, just there—changed us. But sometimes a moment comes along, in our private lives or our collective ones, that overwhelms us immediately with the awareness of its being a thing that matters. This year, from the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, has been that sort of moment, surreally extended and bloated, composed of a cascade of mini-moments too rapid to process. What does it mean? we’ve sputtered as it hit us. Where will it leave its mark on us (individually, collectively)? How will it appear when we look back on it years from now?<br />Writing, suggests the English novelist Zadie Smith,  is an attempt to control the mystifying rush of experience—to “take this largely shapeless bewilderment and pour it into a mold.” In “Intimations,” her new collection of essays, Ms. Smith gives form to our experience of 2020. Written during the early months of the pandemic, these six short pieces parse its first traces—the intimations of virus or, as Ms. Smith calls it, “the global humbling.” They are lean and powerful—the collection is less than 100 pages—like pencil sketches that capture a scene or a figure in a few brief masterly strokes. When we do look back on this period, these are among the essays we will turn to.<br />“Peonies” opens in the last days of normalcy before lockdown, Ms. Smith suddenly pausing in the middle of her rushed routine to stare at flowers springing up in the middle of New York City. She is drawn by instinct, her fingers curled around the bars of the garden gate. The episode is “a tiny, early preview of what I now feel every moment of every day, that is, the complex and ambivalent nature of ‘submission,’ ” she writes. She gestures to ways we’ve had to accommodate resistance and submission, fighting the virus by submitting—to mask-wearing, to staying home, to a new reality.<br />In “The American Exception,” she considers death and its uneven distribution in America: “The virus map of the New York boroughs turns redder along precisely the same lines as it would if the relative shade of crimson counted not infection and death but income brackets and middle-school ratings.” Far from being a great equalizer, the pandemic has highlighted the old hierarchies. Will Americans, jolted out of complacency, change this state of affairs? Will we go back to forgetting the underpaid workers we now applaud as “essential”? Ms. Smith draws on the example of postwar Europe which, after years of death, decided that healthcare shouldn’t be dictated by private interests.<br />The essays that follow—on time and suffering—continue to probe the disparities in our experience of the pandemic. Our relation to time has been altered, but there are workers who don’t need to fill time, whose days are overburdened with essential tasks, and there is everyone else, with some time to fill. In “Something to Do,” she weighs the existential problem of how we do time, which the pandemic has thrown into sharp new light. “Like pugs who have been lifted out of a body of water, our little limbs keep pumping on, as they did when we were hurrying off to our workplaces.” We bake banana bread, we paint, we make a video. But without love, she concludes, life is just doing time: “Busyness will not disguise its lack.”</td>

The initiative guarantees all of them a weekly, at-home nasal swab and a lab analysis—whether they are reporting for duty in-person, or not. The company is recommending that every staffer be tested weekly.<br />The offer proved so popular that Google’s internal website for it crashed shortly after going live Thursday. Employees at Google’s flagship search properties, as well as company arms including YouTube, Google X, fiber internet and artificial intelligence, all have access to the testing. International Google employees will be offered access starting next year.<br />While other companies, ranging from  Tyson Foods Inc.  to  Delta Air Lines Inc.,  have begun testing staff who report on-site, Google’s appears to be the largest yet aimed at employees stuck at home since March. Google staff since that time has been under a work-from-home order, recently extended to September 2021.<br />The polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests look for the virus’s genetic material in samples collected by a self-administered nasal swab. Google contracted with health-care firm BioIQ Inc. to send out the kits and find the laboratories where the results can be processed quickly.</td>

      <td>Central bank adds that banks can restart share buybacks, with limits, and continues to cap dividends</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve said Friday that the largest U.S. banks remain strong enough to survive the coronavirus crisis but warned that a prolonged economic downturn could saddle them with hundreds of billions of dollars in losses on soured loans.<br />The Fed also said it would allow the banks to restart share buybacks but that it would, at least in the first quarter, restrict the amount. It said it would continue to restrict dividend payouts.<br />Under two hypothetical scenarios, in which unemployment remains high and the economy doesn’t bounce back for several quarters, the 33 largest U.S. banks could be hit with as much as $600 billion in loan losses, the Fed said in the latest iteration of its stress test. That would erode the capital buffers meant to keep them on sound financial footing, the central bank said.<br />Designed to gauge the health of the nation’s banks, the stress tests were expanded this year to study the effect of the downturn brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Earlier this year, the Fed placed restrictions on the biggest banks’ dividend payouts and share buybacks, a move to preserve capital in an unsettled economy. At that time, the Fed stopped all buybacks and said dividends couldn’t exceed a bank’s recent profits. The Fed in September extended the restrictions through the end of this year.</td>

      <td>The cocktail was invented in the U.S., but it soon became a worldwide symbol of sophistication.</td>
      <td>Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today’s world. Read previous columns here.<br />In 1887, the Chicago Tribune hailed the martini as the quintessential Christmas drink, reminding readers that it is “made of Vermouth, Booth’s Gin, and Angostura Bitters.” That remains the classic recipe, even though no one can say for certain who created it.<br />The journalist H.L. Mencken famously declared that the martini was “the only American invention as perfect as the sonnet,” and there are plenty of claimants to the title of inventor. The city of Martinez, Calif., insists the martini was first made there in 1849, for a miner who wanted to celebrate a gold strike with something “special.” Another origin story gives the credit to Jerry Thomas, the bartender of the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, in 1867.<br />Of course, just as calculus was discovered simultaneously by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, the martini may have sprung from multiple cocktail shakers. What soon made it stand out from all other gin cocktails was its association with high society. The hero of “Burning Daylight,” Jack London’s 1910 novel about a gold-miner turned entrepreneur, drinks martinis to prove to himself and others that he has “arrived.” Ernest Hemingway paid tribute to the drink in his 1929 novel “A Farewell To Arms” with the immortal line, “I had never tasted anything so cool and clean. They made me feel civilized.”<br />Prohibition was a golden age for the martini. Its adaptability was a boon: Even the coarsest bathtub gin could be made palatable with the addition of vermouth and olive brine (a dirty martini), a pickled onion (Gibson), lemon (twist), lime cordial (gimlet) or extra vermouth (wet). President Franklin D. Roosevelt was so attached to the cocktail that he tried a little martini diplomacy on Stalin during the Yalta conference of 1945. Stalin could just about stand the taste but informed Roosevelt that the cold on the way down wasn’t to his liking at all.</td>

Mr. Raymond engineered the $82 billion merger of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. in 1999 and helped build the combined company into America’s biggest oil producer before leaving at the end of 2005.<br />They also raised concerns that JPMorgan has for years waived the board’s retirement age of 72 for the 82-year-old Mr. Raymond, the bank’s longest-serving director and a trusted adviser to Chairman and Chief Executive James Dimon.<br />In a memo to the bank’s staff, Mr. Dimon said Mr. Raymond was “an instrumental force in helping make JPMorgan Chase the outstanding company it is today,” adding that he helped the bank navigate through some of its most challenging times.</td>

Leaders have aimed to pair the passage of the Covid-19 aid bill with a broader spending bill.<br />It wasn’t clear if lawmakers in the Senate will block consideration of the spending patch, which would keep the government funded through Dec. 20. Any one senator can prevent the chamber from skipping its time-consuming procedures. But by Friday afternoon, it was clear that a coronavirus aid package wouldn’t be finalized in time to pass with a spending bill needed to avoid a government shutdown at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.<br />“There’s some always last-minute stuff that pops up, but it’s coming together,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R., S.D.) said of the negotiations. “I think we have to assume that even when there’s a deal announced, that by the time it gets written up and processed, we’re going to be pushing through the weekend.”<br />Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said on the Senate floor Friday morning that talks continued to make progress. “I am even more optimistic now than I was last night that a bipartisan, bicameral framework for a major rescue package is close at hand,” he said.</td>

      <td>The Dallas Fed president said he remains concerned extended periods of bond buying could bring problems</td>
      <td>Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said Friday that he believes it will be time for the central bank to start pulling back on its bond-buying stimulus efforts when it is clear the economy is recovering strongly.<br />“I’m going to deliberately stay away from a timetable,” Mr. Kaplan said in a Wall Street Journal interview. However, Mr. Kaplan said that as 2021 moves forward and vaccines to treat Covid-19 roll out, if the Fed is “making substantial progress on our dual mandate goals, I do think it would be healthy and very appropriate to begin the process of tapering our asset purchases.”<br />Tapering means slowing the monthly buying pace on the way toward ending the effort.<br />Mr. Kaplan said he remains concerned extended periods of bond buying could bring problems. “These purchases, if they go on for longer than they need to, I worry that they have some distorting impact on price discovery, that they encourage excessive risk taking, and excessive risk taking can create excesses and imbalances that can be difficult to deal with in the future.”<br />Mr. Kaplan has been a voting member at this year’s Federal Open Market Committee meetings, and his comments Friday were the first since that body met this week. On Thursday, the Fed said it was holding its short-term rate target at near-zero levels, where it will likely stay for several years to come, and pressing forward with $120 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage-bond buying. Those purchases are aimed at supporting financial markets and keeping real world borrowing costs low.</td>

It has now gained more than 13% year-to-date.<br />Gains accelerated Thursday, spurred by fears the U.S. might reapply sanctions on  United Co. Rusal  International PJSC, a Russian aluminum producer and major supplier to Europe. Previous sanctions against the company sparked a steep climb in prices for the metal, disrupting the aluminum industry and threatening profits at manufacturers such as Boeing and Ford.<br />Aluminum’s recent surge extends a rebound from its early-year drop, when investors feared demand would slide precipitously as auto makers halted production and planes were grounded. Many industrial metals have notched gains recently, fueled by a faster-than-expected recovery in China, a key source of global demand for commodities.<br />Demand also has come from one unexpected source: beverage cans.

In a dissent, the court’s three liberals argued that there was no need to wait before ruling that Mr. Trump’s initiative violated federal law.<br />The Trump administration’s plan, announced in July, could shift House seats from immigrant-rich states such as California to more rural, Republican-leaning areas with less diverse populations. Under federal law, state population totals must be sent to the president by Dec. 31 and he must deliver them to the newly elected House within a week of its opening, which normally occurs Jan. 3.<br />But the 2020 census count, disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, is behind schedule, and a House committee said earlier this month that the figures wouldn’t be ready before Jan. 23. That is three days after Mr. Trump leaves office, meaning that President-elect Joe Biden could cancel the exclusion plan once he is sworn in.<br />Even if Mr. Trump is able to transmit numbers before Jan. 20, an administration lawyer told the Supreme Court at a hearing last month that it wasn’t clear how many noncitizens lacking legal status feasibly could be removed from the apportionment base.</td>

No. An investigation of the 2016 Russia-collusion probe and the dismissal of charges against Mike Flynn? Yes. New oversight of sensitive political investigations and surveillance of U.S. citizens? Yes. A criminal referral about Mr. Trump’s call to the Ukrainian president? No. Repeated demands—from the left and the right—for his department to engage in politics? No, no, no.<br />Consequential decisions have a way of annoying people—Democrats, Republicans, the staff, one’s boss—but Mr. Barr, who’d been attorney general before, from 1991-93, knew that going in. “I’m in a position in life where I can do the right thing and not really care about the consequences,” he told senators during his January 2019 confirmation hearing. In a 90-minute phone interview Tuesday—less than 24 hours after the announcement of his resignation, effective Dec. 23—he sounded his usual spirited self.<br />He reminds me why he took the job in the first place: “The Department of Justice was being used as a political weapon” by a “willful if small group of people,” who used the claim of collusion with Russia in an attempt to “topple an administration,” he says. “Someone had to make sure that the power of the department stopped being abused and that there was accountability for what had happened.” Mr. Barr largely succeeded, in the process filling a vacuum of political oversight, reimposing norms, and resisting partisan critics on both sides.<br />Mr. Barr describes an overarching objective of ensuring that there is “one standard of justice.” That, he says, is why he appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate the FBI’s 2016 Crossfire Hurricane probe. “Of course the Russians did bad things in the election,” he says. “But the idea that this was done with the collusion of the Trump campaign—there was never any evidence. It was entirely made up.” The country deserved to know how the world’s premier law-enforcement agency came to target and spy on a presidential campaign.</td>

      <td>Notes, empty yogurt containers—all left behind in March as colleagues fled. Will we return soon?</td>
      <td>New York<br />I was sitting in my office the other day, relishing the silence but also regretting it. As I scanned the empty desks where my colleagues and I used to banter in an open newsroom-like setting, I was beholding the ghost town that has become the white-collar workplace.<br />I’d only visited a few times since March, to retrieve items like the mail and my checkbook. Like many professionals, I’ve found a comfortable way to work from home, at a laptop in the dining room next to my wife. But on this particular day our son had politely evicted us and our dog so he could be free of disruptions during a virtual medical-school interview. Never one to set up shop in  Starbucks ,  I had only one option for getting anything done—the office. I traipsed 40 blocks to Columbus Circle to try to experience work the way it used to be.<br />New York’s business corridors have remained mostly abandoned during Covid. In late October, one survey estimated office occupancy at 10%. The figure has surely dropped amid the latest surge. While big banks and real-estate firms have required employees to be on site at least part of the time, smaller shops like mine have kept their distance, turning offices into expensive storage lockers.<br />My building on Broadway and 57th Street, which ironically completed a seven-year renovation last year, has all the requisite fortifications: a plexiglass-shielded front desk, hand sanitizers and social-distancing markers. The elevator posts a scary warning about aerosol droplets and instructions not to speak. But no one was around. The masked security guard confirmed that many tenants have moved out and others are staying away. It seemed a droplet-free environment: I could have belted out an aria without hitting anyone.</td>

Her enormous head, small body and wide-open eyes signal “adorable.” Her vulnerability triggers our protective instincts.<br />But then there’s that knife she’s holding.<br />“The Girl With the Knife in Her Hand” was a breakthrough work for Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara. Painted in 1991, it’s the first in a long line of female figures in his work that combine irresistible cuteness—kawaii in Japanese—with the dark emotions of adulthood: seething anger, sorrow, pain.<br />Hovering between innocence and violence, “The Girl With the Knife in Her Hand” was born, Mr. Nara has said, “from confronting my own self.” Other endearing but unsettling figures populate Mr. Nara’s drawings, paintings and sculptures as well, including crowds of sleepwalkers, flop-eared dogs on stilts and childlike heads submerged in puddles.<br />This season, Mr. Nara is the subject of two major museum exhibitions in the U.S. “I Forgot Their Names and Often Can’t Remember Their Faces but Remember Their Voices Well” is scheduled to open at the Dallas Contemporary on Jan. 30. “Yoshitomo Nara,” a retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), focuses on the artist’s abiding passion for music. Originally scheduled for last April, it has already been installed but is waiting to open until pandemic restrictions are lifted; the show is planned to run through July 2021.</td>

      <td>It appears spying, not destruction, was the aim; U.S. officials have yet to define precise impact of the suspected Kremlin intrusion</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Despite its size, a sprawling computer hack blamed on Russia could leave President Trump and the incoming Biden administration struggling to find the right response, former U.S. cybersecurity officials and experts said.<br />While Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) called the breaches that hit at least six cabinet-level departments as well as private companies “virtually a declaration of war,” the former officials said the intrusions fell more along the lines of classic digital espionage, however brazen. As far as is known from descriptions of the hack, no data was altered or destroyed, and no computer systems or other infrastructure damaged.<br />Further complicating any consideration of response options is that U.S. officials are only now beginning to understand the breadth and severity of the hack. Because of the careful and stealthy nature of the incursion,  a full damage assessment and recovery operation “is a months, if not yearslong, ordeal,” a senior intelligence official said.<br />“The scope of it is pretty stunning,” the official said. “The most disconcerting thing is the uncertainty around what [computer] systems they are in.”  The official added that there was no evidence that classified systems had been violated, but cautioned that was a preliminary conclusion.<br />Past U.S. responses to Russian hacking and disinformation operations—sanctions, property seizures, diplomatic expulsions, even the cyber equivalent of warning shots—appear to have done little to dissuade the Kremlin. Moscow has denied responsibility for the latest incursion.</td>

      <td>Tesla Inc.  will officially join the S&P 500 Monday, likely precipitating a frenzied Friday afternoon in markets.<br />The electric-car maker will be by far the largest firm by market value ever to join the S&P, the most widely tracked stock index. Tesla’s inclusion will prompt the dozens of index funds that track the S&P to seek to purchase tens of billions of dollars of stock at Friday’s closing price, in a bid to track the index as closely as possible. Because of the firm’s size and the volatility of its shares, Tesla’s addition may ripple through the market in additional, unpredictable ways, traders said.<br />A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices, which oversees the S&P 500, said the company consulted with market participants and communicated the addition to the market “far in advance of typical index changes.”<br />Here are five things to watch:<br />Tesla’s addition to the S&P 500 coincides with quadruple witching, which occurs four times a year and refers to the day that options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. These heavy volumes will boost liquidity and will likely help smooth the addition of Tesla to the S&P, traders have said.</td>

      <td>Mozart may be famed as a prodigy, but Jan Swafford celebrates his apprehension of humanity in full.</td>
      <td>One January night in 1761, little Wolfgang Mozart insisted on playing a challenging harpsichord piece he had just heard performed by his older sister, already a virtuoso. He had never played a keyboard before. At the beginning of “Mozart: The Reign of Love” (don’t let the sappy subtitle put you off), the esteemed composer and biographer Jan Swafford writes:<br /><br /><br />Three years later, on his first visit to London, the prodigy, it was reported, was rolling around on a table when someone handed him a song by Johann Christian Bach. “The boy glanced at the score upside down, pointed out a wrongly copied note, and continued his roll on the table.”<br />Mr. Swafford delights in repeating these stories—it’s one of the pleasures of this comprehensive and engaging biography. He is thoroughly up-to-date on the latest information and controversies, debunking the still commonly held mythology about the composer, and he continually reminds us of what astounding music Mozart wrote: “No artist,” Mr. Swafford asserts, “made more of pleasure—made it deeper, more liberated, more sensual.”</td>

      <td>The professor and author hopes to expand humanities offerings on campus, even for scientists and engineers</td>
      <td>Andrew Delbanco recalls teaching a class about Abraham Lincoln at Columbia University several years ago and having a student challenge his regard for the Gettysburg Address. The young Black woman wondered how he could expect her to share his respect for a Civil War speech that never mentioned slavery. “That’s a really hard question,” Mr. Delbanco says.<br />He recalls answering her by first noting that Lincoln’s contempt for slavery was implied by his call for “a new birth of freedom.” He then explained that Lincoln was trying to rally the public behind the war before an election against a rival who was pushing peace, and “slavery wasn’t top of mind” for most Northerners. But the moment highlighted important contrasts in the experience of American history in the classroom. “She was listening and I think learning through our conversation, but so was I,” says Mr. Delbanco, 68.<br />Mr. Delbanco, the Alexander Hamilton Professor of American Studies at Columbia, describes teaching as a moral activity. “I have this old-fashioned view that the classroom experience can actually give young people a better self-understanding and a greater awareness of the world around them,” he says. When students read great texts together, whether they are wrestling with the difference between love and desire in Shakespeare or considering Hannah Arendt’s analysis of totalitarianism, they ultimately learn how to think and listen to competing points of view. This makes them better able to function in a democracy, he says, “which, as we are often reminded of now, is a hard thing to do.”<br />Too many students leave college without these skills, Mr. Delbanco says. As the price of college rises and the job market contracts, young people are wary of pursuits that could delay paying off their debts. In search of marketable degrees, many are neglecting the humanities. To study philosophy or English literature in 2020 is basically conspicuous consumption.<br />Mr. Delbanco thinks that he has a solution. As president of the Teagle Foundation, which supports liberal-arts education, he is working to revive a humanities-based general education on college campuses across the country. Together with the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Teagle Foundation is sponsoring a $7 million grant program over five years to expand access to classroom experiences that reckon with the purpose of life.</td>

      <td>Shareholders have little choice but to trust billionaire backer Vincent Bolloré as the French media giant slowly moves toward an IPO of its most successful asset</td>
      <td>While the pandemic has silenced concert halls around the globe this year, the world’s largest music companies have had plenty of excuses to party. The latest is Chinese tech giant Tencent’s move to double its 10% stake in Universal Music Group.<br />The deal announced Friday should bolster investor confidence in  Vivendi ,  which will still own the remaining 80% of UMG. The rub is that the French media company’s outside shareholders aren’t in control of what it does with the cash raised. Vincent Bolloré, the billionaire who steers the company via his family vehicle, has a record of controversial investments.<br />Tencent’s decision to double down on Santa Monica, Calif.-based UMG, the largest of the “big three” companies that own rights to most of the world’s recorded music, isn’t a huge surprise. It agreed to buy 10% last year at a total company valuation of €30 billion, equivalent to $36.8 billion, with the option to buy another 10% at the same valuation by Jan. 15, 2021—an option it is now exercising. The price tag seemed high at the time, but meanwhile stock markets have enthusiastically tuned into the music industry. Shares of  Warner Music Group ,  another of the big three, have risen 44% since their initial public offering in June, while Spotify stock has more than doubled this year.<br />UMG hasn’t been immune to Covid-19, but its symptoms have been relatively mild. In the second quarter, when much of the Western world was locked down, its revenues fell less than 5% after stripping out currency and portfolio changes, as a collapse in CD, merchandising and other revenues typically dependent on physical interactions was partly offset by further growth in streaming. In the third quarter, UMG’s revenues rose 6.1%—slower than before the pandemic but nothing to worry about.<br />For Vivendi investors, the drama has been elsewhere. Most notably, the company has accumulated a roughly 27% stake in Lagardère, an underperforming French conglomerate, and teamed up with an activist hedge fund to push for board seats. Bernard Arnault, the controlling shareholder of  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton  and Europe’s richest man, has taken a smaller stake in support of the founding family that still runs Lagardère.</td>

      <td>Mickey Haller is back, but instead of working from his car, he’s in a cell.</td>
      <td>“No one is ever found innocent in a court of law,” says Mickey Haller, the “Lincoln Lawyer” who works out of the back seat of his car and narrates Michael Connelly’s Los Angeles-set novel “The Law of Innocence” (Little, Brown, 423 pages, $29). “The justice system can only deliver a verdict of guilty or not guilty. . . . The law of innocence is unwritten.”<br />Mickey must use his legal acumen after he himself is charged with homicide and locked in downtown L.A.’s forbidding Twin Towers jail. The police claim he killed a former client named Sam Scales, a con man who cheated Mickey out of his fee. The case against him is strong: Ballistic evidence indicates Sam was murdered in Mickey’s garage, and the body was found in the trunk of his Lincoln, with Mickey at the wheel. The lawyer, for the sake of his reputation and livelihood, needs to win more than an acquittal.<br />Mickey, of course, will represent himself. Assisting him is an eccentric dream team: his law partner Jennifer, his investigator “Cisco,” his case manager Lorna (Mickey’s second ex-wife, now married to Cisco), co-counsel Maggie (Mickey’s first ex-wife)—and retired LAPD detective Harry Bosch, Mr. Connelly’s better-known series protagonist and Mickey’s half-brother. Facing them is pitiless prosecutor “Death Row Dana” Berg and the full might of the state of California.<br />“A murder case is like a tree,” Mickey says. “It has been carefully planted and cared for by the state. . . . The tree must stand strong against the winds that challenge it. And that’s where I come in. I’m the man with the ax.” Who bore such a grudge against Mickey and framed him? For that matter, who wanted Sam Scales dead? Mickey’s team combs through his case files to find cause for possible grievance, and works to discover what shenanigans Sam had in play.<br />“The Law of Innocence” takes place from October 2019 to March 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic gradually makes its presence felt. As in his Bosch stories, Mr. Connelly keeps his L.A. references up-to-date: The Musso & Frank Grill on Hollywood Boulevard is still hanging on in its 101st year, but Du-Par’s diner in Studio City, co-counsel Maggie laments, “isn’t there anymore.” The book is full of knowing info about how jurors are researched (“Sometimes you want the Mercedes on the jury. Sometimes you want the Prius.”) and how to seed doubt during testimony (“It’ll be about the questions we ask, not the answers”).</td>

      <td>Wall Street is unconcerned by falling sales, but might be placing too much faith in a rosy spring</td>
      <td>A dark winter for the dining industry hasn’t scared off stockholders in restaurant chains. But a roaring spring is needed to validate that faith.<br />Darden Restaurants  said Friday that sales volumes have slowed significantly as the fall has progressed. Comparable sales fell about 22% from a year earlier at its Olive Garden locations for the week ending Nov. 8; the decline accelerated to about 33% for the week ending Dec. 13.<br />Tougher coronavirus restrictions help explain the falloff: 92% of company restaurants had at least some permitted dining room capacity for the entire week in early November and that figure has dipped to about 75%. For the fiscal third quarter, which ends in February, Darden expects a total revenue drop of 30 to 35% from a year earlier.<br />Wall Street didn’t flinch at the news, however: shares were flat in morning trading and aren’t far from record highs.  Brinker International  shares hardly budged after the Chili’s owner reported a similar decline in weekly sales on Wednesday and are up about 30% so far this year.<br />The apparent nonchalance has a strong rationale: Darden has a long record of growth and profitability, and expects to eke out a small profit even during a time of crisis. The company plans to grow its restaurant count in the fiscal year ending in May, and has reinstated its dividend. Markets are forward-looking by nature, and are well aware that vaccines are on the way and the pandemic may wind down in 2021.</td>

Fractional-share trading enables you to purchase a sliver of a share with as little as $1, putting a stake in single stocks within anyone’s reach. As with any technology, whether that’s good or bad depends on how you use it.<br />After a decadelong bull market, buying the average stock has never required more capital.

At several leading brokerage firms, you can put up $5 or less and buy about 1/120th of a share, commission-free.<br />Earlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules redefining a “round lot,” which has long been 100 shares. From now on, it will consist of 100 shares only for stocks priced up to $250. At higher prices, the size of a round lot drops to 40 shares, then 10. Above $10,000, a single share will constitute a round lot.</td>

      <td>A tale of conspiracy and dreams, a story of high-stakes board games and a catalog of fools.</td>
      <td>‘Ah, revolution . . .’ sighs the beleaguered heroine of “Peach Blossom Paradise” (NYRB, 377 pages, $17.95) by Chinese writer Ge Fei. “Revolution is when no one has any idea what they’re doing. You know you’re making revolution, it’s true, but you have absolutely no idea what’s going on.” The novel, the first volume of Mr. Ge’s Jiangnan Trilogy, takes place at the start of the 20th century during the lawless final years of the Qing Dynasty, and although the Xinhai Revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China provide it backdrop, this sinuous, captivating epic is less interested in textbook history than in the madness and illusions that underwrite it.<br />The novel centers on the character of Xiumi, whom we meet as a 15-year-old girl in a declining estate in a village north of the Yangtze River. Xiumi’s father has gone insane and disappeared, apparently to seek out a mythical paradise known as the Peach Blossom Spring. Replacing him in the household is a man claiming to be Xiumi’s uncle, who keeps suspect company, speaks about an imminent political upheaval and does little to disguise his lecherous thoughts about Xiumi. He is only the first man she encounters in a growing web of revolutionaries, imperial spies, assassins and gangsters, all of whom view her as a spoil of battle. But the power dynamic alters when Xiumi adapts to the ruthlessness of age, emerging as one of the leading conspirators in the insurrection.<br />Mr. Ge began writing in the 1980s as part of a golden generation of Chinese novelists that included Yu Hua and Su Tong. Initially this group mimicked the styles of the avant-garde (Mr. Ge’s “Flock of Brown Birds” from 1989 is Borgesian meta-fiction). Later, in a fascinating collective about-face, they turned to social realism and historical sagas. Yet a residue of the uncanny and the fantastical remained. “The Invisibility Cloak,” Mr. Ge’s wonderfully subtle 2012 novel about an ordinary craftsman’s encounters with the Chinese mafia, adds a tincture of magic to its everyman portrayal. “Peach Blossom Paradise”—it was originally published in 2004—has the crowded cast, the close attention to setting and the dramatic twists of traditional historical fiction, yet its fixation with dreams, disguises and delusions gives it the feeling of an otherworldly fable.<br />In part, the narrative sustains its mysterious atmosphere by occupying the points of view of children—first taking Xiumi’s perspective, and then that of the son of a servant. And just as the children’s comprehension of events is screened and limited, political instability has undermined the expected functions of social stations. Mr. Ge will mention an apparently insignificant walk-on character, say a servant, a laborer or a beggar. Many chapters later that figure will reappear in a changed and far more prominent role—only then, as often as not, to be swiftly toppled from power. “Peach Blossom Paradise” has none of the solidity of settled history. Or rather, its unspoken point is that history itself is the incalculable sum of countless individual desires and misapprehensions.<br />A degree of delicacy is required to conjure the theme of transience, and it seems to me that Canaan Morse’s translation into English is exemplary, capturing the novel’s many registers—its childhood innocence, its biting humor and its streaks of terror and brutality—while preserving the narrative buoyancy that seems to leave the entire novel levitating in midair. “Everything in the world can be predicted except for trouble,” says one of Xiumi’s caretakers at the beginning of this excellent novel, offering a harbinger of the surprises to come. “Every time trouble appears it’s different, and only after it starts do you find out what it’s really like.”</td>

      <td>In playful abstractions and sumptuous fantasies, a generation of animators explored the subversive possibilities of cartoons.</td>
      <td>Five years ago, Reid Mitenbuler penned “Bourbon Empire,” about the business of liquor. It’s only fitting that his new book is on animation history, since both subjects are the stuff that dreams and nightmares are made of. In the toon industry’s past, distilled spirits frequently stimulated anthropomorphic conjuring.<br />“Wild Minds: The Artists and Rivalries That Inspired the Golden Age of Animation” is a colorful chronology of the first 50 years of American animated film. Juicy tales abound about the films and the wildly imaginative people who made them. Mr. Mitenbuler tells their stories with relish and clarity.<br />His underlying purpose is serious: recalling a time, from the turn of the 20th century to the 1950s, when most mainstream animated films were not made primarily for children. Today, the majority of TV and feature animation is ghettoized as kiddie fare. Back then, toon films were geared to adults, lobbing what Mr. Mitenbuler describes as “little hand grenades of social and political satire: bawdy yet clever, thoughtful even if they were rude.”<br />Early animation was a freewheeling era when “wild minds” pioneered creative possibilities. A time when Betty Boop offered flashes of nudity, Popeye’s yarns held “sly messages about the injustices of unchecked capitalism” and star critters such as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck made fun of current events, mores, movies, even their studio bosses. A feature-length animated film became a classical-music concert; Donald Duck propaganda shorts urged folks to pay their taxes for the war effort and to be good neighbors to South America. “During its first half-century,” notes Mr. Mitenbuler, “animation was an important part of culture wars about free speech, censorship, the appropriate boundaries of humor, and the influence of art and media on society.”<br />Three catalysts, starting in the late 1940s, forever altered animated cartoons: U.S. antitrust decisions dynamiting movie-studio distribution, television’s rise, and demographic changes following the postwar baby boom. Parents realized that their TV sets could function as babysitters; advertisers realized that those children “provided a way into their parents’ pocketbooks.” This led to the sanitizing of cartoons and the censoring of films meant for older audiences—the better to sell breakfast cereals.</td>

      <td>After decades of nostalgia for the Apollo program,  it’s time for NASA to send astronauts on a radical new adventure, worthy of America’s pioneering spirit</td>
      <td><br />Since the Apollo program ended almost 50 years ago, every newly elected U.S. president has been vexed by the same question: Where next to send astronauts?<br />NASA’s current target is the moon, but the moon belongs to a previous generation of American pioneers. A grander, more fitting ambition for the space program that first landed human beings on another heavenly body is Mars—a destination that NASA has been preparing to reach since the days of its early visionaries. It is now time to realize their dream.<br />The Artemis program is NASA’s centerpiece today for human spaceflight. Its aim is to put astronauts on the lunar surface by 2024, but the prospects for that date are dim. There is still no well-defined mission plan, and work on the Artemis rocket and capsule are behind schedule and over budget.<br />As for sending astronauts to Mars, NASA has somehow always been a couple of tantalizing decades away from sending astronauts to Mars, thanks to the shifting priorities of successive presidents. Consider the switch-ups just since 1988, when George H.W. Bush pushed for a return to the moon, to be followed by a mission to Mars. Bill Clinton canceled the lunar plan (to say nothing of Mars) and embraced the International Space Station. George W. Bush revived the moon-Mars sequence. Barack Obama nixed the moon part of the program, saying that NASA had “been there, done that,” and opted instead for an asteroid mission and then Mars. Donald Trump rejected the Mars plan, choosing instead to reach the moon with Artemis, but NASA still says that Mars is on its agenda.</td>

      <td>Selected by Annalena McAfee, author of the novel ‘Nightshade.’</td>
      <td>By Gavin Maxwell (1960)<br />1. Gavin Maxwell’s account of his life in an isolated cottage on Scotland’s wild west coast became a cult classic and was later turned into a soupy hit movie. (Maxwell loathed the script.) His glorious prose describes hills, water and shifting weather as well as the people who live in this remarkable place. Among them two boys, 13-year-old twins, whom he watches as, “edged with yellow light,” they laughed and danced as they played. But time has revealed the misanthropic Maxwell as an unreliable and deluded narrator. His plan was to raise otters as pets in the wilderness, and this enthralling book is in part a cautionary tale on the perils of anthropomorphism. There are moments of grim, unwitting comedy that summon memories of Werner Herzog’s ill-fated Grizzly Man. Maxwell’s otters didn’t end up eating him, though they did their best to maim him while also biting off the fingers of his young assistant.<br />By Nan Shepherd (1977)<br />2. Nan Shepherd was a Scottish teacher with a passion for her local mountains, the Cairngorms. The time in which “The Living Mountain” was written—the years of World War II—is evident in its voice: “Mankind is sated with noise; but up here, this naked, this elemental savagery, this infinitesimal cross-section of sound from the energies that have been at work for aeons in the universe, exhilarates rather than destroys.” Rejected by her publishers, the book lay unregarded in Shepherd’s desk for three decades until it was published four years before she died at 88. Since then, “The Living Mountain” has been acknowledged as a masterpiece of nature writing. One photograph of Shepherd as a young woman shows her in the guise of a Celtic princess, strong jawed, a jewelled diadem crowning her long braids. The diadem was in fact a strip of celluloid film she had playfully fixed round her head with a brooch. It’s a measure of Shepherd’s celebrity, albeit belated, that this image is immortalized on the current Scottish five-pound note.<br />By Adam Nicolson (2001)</td>

      <td>A passionate champion of German language and legend, he was prescient about the historical nightmares to come.</td>
      <td>For Nazi censors in the 1930s, “Die Lorelei” presented a special problem. One of the best-known German poems, it tells of a maiden who sits on a mountaintop overlooking the Rhine, combing her golden hair and singing a melody so enchanting that sailors below are transfixed and shipwrecked. “Die Lorelei” had been sung as a folk song for a hundred years, and it could hardly be omitted from verse anthologies. But its author was Jewish, which made it impossible for him to appear in a Nazi-approved book. As a compromise, the poem was credited to “Anonymous.”<br />If Heinrich Heine, the author of “Die Lorelei,” could have witnessed this sinister farce, he would have been appalled but not surprised. Heine was passionately devoted to German language, legend and landscape; “at bottom I really love Germany more than anything else in the world,” he wrote to a friend. But he was also a prescient foe of the German nationalism which began to flourish after the defeat of his admired Napoleon, whom Heine described as “the man of the idea, the idea become man.” In his prose works, he warned against his countrymen’s distortion of history and their exaltation of violence. One day, Heine prophesied, German chauvinism would take power, and “a play will be enacted in Germany which will make the French Revolution look like a harmless idyll.”<br />Heine’s sharp historical vision and tormented relationship to his country were owed in large part to his Jewishness, which made him a perpetual outsider. So he is a fitting subject for Yale’s “Jewish Lives” series of short biographies, whose previous subjects include everyone from the biblical Jacob to Barbra Streisand. Some books in the series have been written by scholars and experts; others put a contemporary writer’s imagination to work on history to see what sparks are struck.<br />George Prochnik is the author of two excellent studies of 20th-century Jewish writers who wrote in German, the novelist Stefan Zweig and the scholar Gershom Scholem. Both combine biography with personal reflections on Mr. Prochnik’s own family history and his complex feelings about Judaism and Zionism. Writing about Heine allows him to go back to the origin of the tradition that ended with Zweig and Scholem, in the generation of the Holocaust.<br />Heine was born in Dusseldorf in 1797, into a family that had already cast off traditional Jewish observance. Like many secularizing Jews, the Heines placed their hopes in the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, which had emancipated the Jews of France from legal disabilities. When Napoleon conquered Germany, the Napoleonic Code gave the country’s Jews civil rights for the first time. One of Heine’s most powerful early memories was of the emperor’s 1811 arrival in Dusseldorf, appearing on horseback in a park where riding was ordinarily forbidden.</td>

      <td>The tricky figure of Reynard carries with him the flavor of an older and wilder world of story.</td>
      <td>So far as we know, the fox as a wicked and tricky character type originated 2,500 years ago with Aesop. As with other animals in the old moralist’s fables, the fox embodied human characteristics: pride, appetite, cunning. After the turn of the first millennium, Aesop’s fox acquired a name and began to catch on in Europe. He turned up in a 12th-century Latin poem composed (probably) by a Flemish monk. Soon after he figured in the Old French satirical tales of “Le Roman de Renart,” becoming so popular that the word for “fox” in French changed from goupil to renard. Reynard popped up in Low German (in the narrative poem “Reinhart Fuchs”) and Middle Dutch (in the verses of “Van den vos Reinarde”) and achieved lasting fame in English thanks to William Caxton’s rollicking 1481 translation from the Dutch, which became one of the first bestsellers in history.<br />In the late 18th century, Goethe celebrated the tawny deceiver in his verse epic “Reineke Fuchs,” which became a fixture of the German canon and, in translation, renewed Reynard’s popularity among English speakers. For centuries, Reynard had the run of Western civilization. And then he went to ground, fading from popular consciousness along with the animals of his cohort: Bruin the bear, Tybert (or Tibert, or Tybalt) the cat, and Isengrim the wolf. And now—he’s back!<br />Drawing from various sources with a bit of her own embroidery, German writer and translator Renate Raecke has abridged the trickster’s adventures for a picture book, “Reynard the Fox” (Minedition, 80 pages, $19.99), with arresting, kinetic artwork by Jonas Lauströer (see below). There’s an edge of savagery in the illustrations that evokes the redness of tooth and claw. For the Reynard that kindled the medieval imagination was no cuddly stuffed animal. Ms. Raecke sands down the edges of the violence, but she doesn’t dull Reynard’s wit as she tells of killing and deceit.<br />King Noble the lion has called his subjects to court in springtime. Reynard refuses to appear, which gives his enemies the opportunity to turn the king against him by enumerating his crimes. Chanticleer the rooster presents the piteous corpse of a decapitated daughter: “Reynard set traps for us!” Greedymind the she-wolf tells how Reynard pretended to teach her to catch fish in a frozen pond by sticking her tail through a hole in the ice and how she was stuck fast. “My need made me credulous,” she testifies, “and I failed to see Reynard’s crafty expression, although I had learnt so often that he was a sly deceiver.”<br />Angered at these breaches of his peace, King Noble sends emissaries to retrieve the fox. Reynard works such terrible mischief on Bruin and Tybalt (as he is here) that both bear and cat stumble back to court bleeding and mutilated—in the latter’s case, missing an eye. Children whose experience of picture-book animals has been confined to the friendly and inoffensive may find it all too much, but those growing up with lots of fairy and folk tales will see that Reynard fits right in with these traditions.</td>

      <td>Your editorial “Breaking Up Facebook” (Dec. 11) brings to mind the Radio Corporation of America. In the late 1950s Congress decided to go after the RCA, a global company that was dominant in the consumer electronics business. As part of a 1958 consent decree, suddenly anybody could license RCA patents at no cost. No domestic company of any consequence took up the offer, but the Japanese did, and that was the end of much of the U.S. consumer electronics industry.<br />Now the next generation of economic illiterates in Congress are going after  Facebook ,  another company that supplies what the public wants. Natural competitive forces will be more efficient in dealing with Facebook than a collection of lawyers looking for a big payday. There is plenty of seed money available for anybody who comes up with an idea for a better product than what Facebook offers.

      <td>Nine months into the Covid-19 pandemic, with millions of Americans still out of work and the nation hurtling into what most economists agree will be a period of sustained economic disruption, Washington has largely ignored worker retraining.<br />More than 22 million Americans were thrown out of work in the first two months of lockdowns and business closures. Even today, although the unemployment rate has fallen, there are 9.8 million fewer jobs in the economy than there were in February. More than three million people who would like to be employed full time are making do with part-time work, and more than 7 million workers who say they want a job are so discouraged that they’ve stopped looking.<br />But even these grim numbers don’t capture the full story. Will the restaurant industry ever bounce back to what it was before the pandemic? Maybe. Business travel? Less likely. Bricks-and-mortar retail? Almost certainly not. That doesn’t mean there won’t be jobs available across the economy; there will be. The Covid economic shock has unleashed unprecedented creative destruction, sharply accelerating the transformation that we once quaintly called the “future of work,” and there will be winners as well as losers.<br />But many jobs—perhaps even occupations—may be lost forever. Countless industries will change dramatically in the years ahead as automation and business restructuring reshape the economy. Even workers who keep their jobs may need retraining to stay abreast of a changing workplace. And many who have been displaced from a failing sector will need to reboot entirely, learning new skills for new jobs, often in unfamiliar industries.<br />Washington has passed eight stimulus measures so far, totaling $3.7 trillion, and there may be another $900 billion on the way. The $2.7 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act included almost $3 billion for governors to spend as they saw fit on education, and a few states found ways to spend some of their allocation on job training, either at community colleges or through the sprawling national network of federal, state and local job training and employment services known as the public workforce system.</td>

Its dilapidated health-care system left it vulnerable to the highly infectious disease.<br />But nearly a year into the pandemic, the pain caused by the Covid-19 measures has become visible.

It withered to less than $1.7 million in October, a 99% drop from the same month a year earlier.<br />North Korean exports of wigs, watches and shoes stopped that month, an official at the Seoul-based Korea International Trade Association said, as authorities on both sides of the border tried to minimize human contact.

      <td>The Aloha State relaxed its entry regulations in the fall, but the pandemic rules are stricter than in most other states and change frequently</td>
      <td>HAWAII REMAINED a paradisiacal bubble of plumy palms and pulsing surf for much of the coronavirus pandemic. The state’s mandatory 14-day visitor quarantine, enacted March 26, all but halted tourism, curbing visitor arrival to the islands from 30,000 daily to fewer than 500. Now, nine months later, the state boasts the lowest average daily case count in the country, but it’s also suffering from the highest unemployment rate in America. After months of reopening delays, Hawaii relaxed travel rules in October to slowly restart tourism, the state’s main economic engine. If you’re tempted to jet off to the Aloha State, however, be wary. The road to Paradise comes with a few hurdles.<br />A pre-travel testing program went into effect Oct. 15, letting travelers forgo the two-week quarantine if they could provide a negative Covid-19 test within 72 hours prior to arrival. Nuances, like having to get a test from a specified provider, caused headaches and on Nov. 28, the island of Kaua`i announced it would opt out of the state’s pre-travel testing program and instead stick to a 14-day quarantine. “There is mass confusion about what is considered a valid test,” said Gary Moore, managing director of Timbers Kaua`i at Hokuala resort. “We’ve had a number of guests arrive with a negative test but it’s from the wrong provider so they need to quarantine.” Mr. Moore encourages travelers to read the fine print of the state’s ever-changing Safe Travels Program (safetravelshawaii.com) ahead of departure as some testing partners, including CVS, that were initially announced have opted out of participating.<br />On Nov. 24, the governor added another layer of complexity to travel by stipulating that visitors must have trusted test results in hand 72 hours in advance of the final leg of their trip. But given this year’s many unexpected delays—not just with flights but with test results—guarantees are in short supply. A few days before their November flight to Oahu, Don and Sheila Martinson, residents of Longmont, Colo., secured an appointment at an urgent care clinic near their home for a rapid PCR test, but the day before the test, the clinic texted to say they had run out of supplies and could not guarantee results in 72 hours. Fortunately, the couple also scheduled a backup test at a nearby  Walgreens  and received results within four hours. Despite the hassles, tourists are trickling into the islands. Between Oct. 15 and Nov. 30, more than 443,000 people came to Hawaii.<br />Before flying, travelers must upload a PDF of their Covid test results to Hawaii’s Safe Travels portal and take a health questionnaire. Once it’s completed, travelers are emailed or texted a QR code which is scanned at the airport upon arrival and at hotels. And since every island has slightly different requirements in place, visitors might want to constrain their vacation to one island.<br />Visitors should be prepared to face pandemic rules stricter than most states’ are. Violators of the statewide mask mandate risk a fine up to $5,000 or a year in jail, tricky since the details of the mandate itself change frequently. The most current regulations require everyone to wear a mask when walking to or from the beach or pool, as well as on hiking trails, at parks, on the sidewalks and in some instances, on guided outrigger canoe excursions.</td>

      <td>Calvary Christian Reformed in suburban Michigan seeks understanding through dialogue; ‘my soul is hurting’</td>
      <td>WYOMING, Mich.—The evening after Election Day, Mark and Nick Elders gathered nearly a dozen members of Calvary Christian Reformed Church in suburban Grand Rapids over Zoom. The brothers asked each person to reveal which presidential candidate they voted for and why.<br />The churchgoers had been meeting weekly to work through their conflicting stances on health care, immigration, gun control, abortion and other issues. They started in early March in the church youth room, seated inches apart on worn couches. Now they were holding their last meeting amid a raging pandemic. Joe Biden’s victory over President Trump was just coming into focus.<br />One by one the participants, a mix of conservatives, liberals and independents, disclosed their White House pick. Jayne Quist said she and her husband, Jim Quist, voted to re-elect President Trump because he is antiabortion and “socialism scares us.” Mark Westrate said he backed a Democrat for the first time in a half-century of voting because “everything seems to be falling apart.”<br />Mark and Nick Elders picked Mr. Biden after voting for Mr. Trump in 2016. That put them at odds with a group member they deeply admire: their father, Dale Elders, who backed the Republican incumbent a second time.<br />The Elders brothers, lifelong members of the church, asked the participants to crack open their 194-page workbooks and begin the difficult process of understanding those who voted the other way. The workbooks, developed by a nonpartisan Christian group, warned them not to treat people with opposing political beliefs as the enemy. Nick Elders closed his eyes and asked God to keep them from losing sight of this for the next four years.</td>

      <td>Some argue educators should be among the first in line after front-line health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities</td>
      <td>Coronavirus vaccines rolled out across the nation this week for front-line health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. Teachers and school staff are vying for one of the first spots in line behind them.<br />Some stakeholders, ranging from teachers to state representatives to governors, have pushed to give priority to educators for coronavirus vaccines as the pandemic destabilizes education for more than 50 million children and their families. School staff are a portion of the 87 million essential workers—including grocers, farmworkers, taxi drivers, firefighters, meatpacking factory workers and aviation employees—who may be next in line for the vaccine. Leaders across these industries have lobbied for prioritization.<br />Advocates for educators hope earlier vaccine access could increase chances of returning to face-to-face learning without the roller coaster of reopening and reclosing for many districts, and bolster safety for school personnel thrust into these essential roles. Schools are indispensable to the economy, they argue, as remote learning created hurdles for the labor market and working parents, with women feeling it most. The education and well-being of children, particularly those students who are most vulnerable, should be top of mind, they say.<br />“By taking myself out of the equation as a vector of transmission, then I feel like we’re going to have a healthier classroom and better attendance,” said Sommer Lyons, a pre-K teacher at McKinley Elementary School in Tulsa, Okla. “Kids do better when we serve them in person.”<br />Federal guidelines could arrive this Sunday when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations for the next set of vaccine prioritizations. The committee will suggest the next phases of distribution—Phase 1b and Phase 1c after front-line health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. The group has so far proposed essential workers under Phase 1b, with high-risk adults following.</td>

He said he and the second lady were “more than happy to step forward to take this safe and effective coronavirus vaccine.”<br />The first U.S. Covid-19 vaccinations began Monday, in the most urgent mass-immunization campaign since the 1950s. By Sunday, the U.S. government is expected to have completed distribution of an initial 2.9 million doses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week authorized the use of the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  and is expected to grant emergency-use authorization of a second vaccine, from  Moderna Inc.,  by late Friday.<br />About 40 million doses are expected to be available this month, and the federal government has said they should go to a priority group of health-care workers and nursing-home residents, who are considered at highest risk of exposure or illness. Together, they number about 24 million.</td>

Previously, Sinopharm said it had inoculated nearly one million people and local health community centers in China began offering ways for people to sign up for shots.<br />Authorities in the United Arab Emirates, where Sinopharm’s vaccines have been undergoing late-stage clinical trial, have said that one of the firm’s vaccine strains is 86% effective. But neither the U.A.E. nor Sinopharm have released details on how researchers arrived at the estimate.</td>

      <td>A head coach hits a history-making mark amid a pandemic-disrupted season</td>
      <td>The first victory? Tara VanDerveer remembers the essential details. The year was 1978, VanDerveer’s inaugural season on the sideline as the head coach of the University of Idaho women’s basketball team. It was a close contest, versus Northern Montana, but as the clock wound down, VanDerveer grew confident they’d win. She instructed her team to play good defense, and importantly, not to foul.<br />“And they went out and fouled,” VanDerveer said, dryly. “I just said, ‘This is going to be harder than it looks.’ ”<br />Idaho still hung on for a 70-68 victory. In the 40-plus seasons since, teams coached by VanDerveer would collect 1,098 more wins, making VanDerveer—now in her 35th season at Stanford after two at Idaho and five at Ohio State—the winningest coach in women’s college basketball history. No. 1,099 arrived Tuesday with a Stanford triumph over the University of the Pacific, giving the 67-year-old VanDerveer the record, one win above her late coaching rival, the Tennessee Volunteers legend Pat Summitt.<br />This commenced a wide celebration of VanDerveer’s career, a low-key but brilliantly steady run which includes a pair of national championships in 1990 and 1992 and a gold medal as the head coach of Team USA in 1996. NBA star Steph Curry sent in a congratulatory video message. (“I’m sure there’s more to come,” he said.) Former Cardinal Chiney Ogwumike, the 2014 WNBA Rookie of the Year, assembled a warm tribute on ESPN’s “SportsCenter” featuring shout-outs from Billie Jean King and Condoleezza Rice. (Ogwumike also sent cupcakes.)<br />“I’ve gotten an incredible number of messages, texts, emails and phone calls,” VanDerveer told me. She was trying to respond to each, but “it’s overwhelming.”</td>

That deal included an option to buy an additional stake of up to 10% at the same valuation.<br />Tencent and Vivendi also signed a separate agreement in March enabling Tencent Music to acquire a minority stake in the Universal subsidiary that owns the record label’s Greater China operations.</td>

      <td>After the 2008 crisis, households and firms spent years rebuilding their finances in what economist Richard Koo dubbed a “balance-sheet recession.” Debt levels have jumped again this time round, but on closer reading, the books tell a more positive story.<br />Due to Covid-19, the borrowings of U.S. nonfinancial companies were 8.5% higher at the end of September than a year earlier, when they were already above the 2009 peak both in absolute levels and as a percentage of gross domestic product. Some publicly-backed programs won’t need to be paid back in full, but many investors are still worried.<br />They can afford to relax. Balance sheets are about assets as well as liabilities.<br />Flow-of-funds data recently published by the Federal Reserve shows that companies have accumulated even more cash than debt this year: Their liquid assets were up 25% in the third quarter. On a net basis, debt was down 7.9%. Relative to GDP, it remains well below 2007 levels.<br />Back then, companies and families started a long process of deleveraging that slowed the economic recovery.

      <td>The beginning of winter will be miserable for the U.S. economy, but things could be looking much brighter by March</td>
      <td>With a worsening Covid-19 crisis sending a new wave of caution across the country, the beginning of winter will be a dark time for the U.S. economy. But by the time winter draws to a close, it could be rebounding more swiftly than seems imaginable.<br />Economists trying to forecast what the first quarter will look like have a seemingly impossible task. First, they need some sense how bad this latest surge in Covid cases might get. Second, they need to know what measures people and state and local governments will take in response and how that might affect spending. Third, they need to weigh how much relief will be coming from the federal government. Finally, and most hopefully, they need to consider how much better things will look toward the end of the quarter as the weather improves and the vaccine rollout gains steam.<br />Most forecasters believe growth will be weaker in the first quarter than in the current quarter and that gross domestic product will remain significantly below its year-earlier level. But with so many moving parts to consider, some are looking for only a modest slowdown while others believe that GDP will register a contraction, sending the economy into a double dip recession.<br />What might actually be more important is not what the first-quarter GDP reading—an average of the economy’s performance in the first three months of the year—looks like, but the economy’s trajectory over the course of the quarter. On that point it is possible to hazard a guess: Really bad, and then really good.<br />Really bad, because of what is happening with Covid. Over the week ended Wednesday, 1.51 million new cases of Covid had been confirmed in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University, which was nearly twice as many as in the first week of November. And 17,988 people died from the disease, making it the pandemic’s most deadly period.</td>
